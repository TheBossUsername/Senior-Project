        "description": "Fluxx is a card game in which the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game. By playing cards, you change numerous aspects of the game: how to draw cards, how to play cards, and even how to win.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game.<br/><br/>Around the World Fluxx uses the basic gameplay of Fluxx, but now you're on visiting famous landmarks around the globe. Discover man-made wonders across all seven continents, from Stonehenge to the Taj Mahal, including the Gal&aacute;pagos Islands, Panama Canal, Angkor Wat, and the Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>Around the World Fluxx offers a bonus mini-timeline game and can be combined with Across America Fluxx for double the bucket list fun!<br/><br/>",

Two are used to form two numbers, which fill in spaces on ships to build them, although the numbers must ultimately fit in ascending order. The unused die is then used to build academies or fuel stations to produce more supplies to get the ships running. Smaller ships are finished faster, but need more supplies, while larger ships are worth many more points but need a lot of turns to get going. Once one player builds three of their five ships, the game ends, and players score based on their completed ships, incomplete ships, and surplus supplies.<br/><br/>As a roll-and-write, players will use the same dice as part of their turn, but each player will take different paths to victory.<br/><br/>This game was the winner of the 2020 Design Machine contest under the theme 'social distancing'.<br/><br/>",

What is more, you will be able to use this new race together with all the other races from Retaliation!<br/><br/>Xyrians are the third additional party to the whole situation happening in Retaliation. Sometimes, they might be your unpredicted ally, sometimes your worst enemy. This mysterious, technologically advanced race has its own goals that will create a lot of exciting situations.<br/><br/>Xyrians are creatures that resemble octopuses, and they have an advanced blending technology that lets them hide in plain view. This is why, during the game with Xyrian, you will be adding their Tokens - but you can never be sure whether this is only an old trace or an actual Xyrian until you step into this room and investigate. Or some random Primeblood may do that for you.<br/><br/>With this race a series of unique serious wounds are introduced! They will not only deal &quot;standard&quot; damage but also perform unique attacks. Imagine being caught in a Xyrian net, losing precious time as you struggle to free yourself, being poisoned with an unknown substance that makes you weaker for a few rounds, or gaining a special marker that will cause all Xyrians to slowly but consequently hunt your Marine. These events definitely add new challenges and some extra narrative depth to your Retaliation missions.<br/><br/>Also, you must be aware that successfully defeating a Xyrian is a rare and challenging feat. But those who manage it are rewarded with exceptionally rare artifacts (i.e., Weapons, Armor, or some precious Items), adding a tantalizing incentive to engage with this new threat. You know the saying &ndash; high risk, high reward.<br/><br/>With the Xyrians in play, exploring the depths of the unknown facility becomes even more intriguing. Each step into the unknown carries new possibilities and dangers. Not that it was easy and predictable before, but with this new breed, it's like the merrier, the more challenging!<br/><br/>They introduce some strategic manipulation to the game! There are possible conflicts between the Xyrians and other alien races, which can be used to your advantage. So, it is likely (not very much, but still possible) that the Xyrians will eliminate as many Primebloods as possible. Their goals will be different with every game. They might aim to infiltrate the Nest, target the most wounded player, or try to hunt down the Queen. Generally, each encounter with the Xyrians feels fresh and challenging and will bring some twists to your game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the Gamefound campaign<br/><br/>",

The claims may in return be challenged by other players and some actions may also be countered. Players whose bluffs are revealed or players who falsely accuse another player of bluffing pay a penalty.<br/><br/>The game is won by either being the last player to have any face down cards or to be the first player to own 13 Spice.<br/><br/>In a special turn of events players may also negotiate for a shared victory using an &quot;allied victory&quot; ability available to all players.<br/><br/>",

The game is quick to learn, a blend of strategy and hand management, and it all fits in one little box.<br/><br/>Each copy of Fray comes with:<br/><br/>30 playable cards&mdash;featuring the Dwarvish, Duanine, and Bjorn suits.<br/>8 instructional cards&mdash;a set for each player.<br/>1 placement card&mdash;to establish the 3x3 grid battlefield before the game begins.<br/><br/>When playing, unit placement is one of the most important aspects in a game of Fray. Consider not just which unit card you'll play, but also where on the battlefield you&rsquo;ll place it! You have a limited number of units and if you&rsquo;re not careful, your opponent may be able to turn your units against you. Luckily, you can do the same to them!<br/><br/>Rounds take on average just 5-10 minutes once you've learned the rules, and the game is easy to both set up and pack away.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Translation of the box back:<br/><br/>Do you prefer to play with two or with more? Or occasionally alone?<br/><br/>Do you prefer an entirely tactical or strategic game? Or do you like a bit of luck or quickness?<br/><br/>Die verr&uuml;ckte Kette offers fascinating variants for the most diverse requirements.<br/><br/>The game principle is simple and easily learned. A plastic chain is continuously changed according to the color combinations on the card. But in a single move, a &quot;displacement&quot;, the situation can change suddenly. It's enough to drive you mad! And a string of lucky circumstances can set off a real chain reaction.<br/><br/>Delightful material, simple rules, multifaceted variants...<br/>... that's Die verr&uuml;ckte Kette, a chain that will captivate you.<br/><br/><br/>Description:<br/><br/>This is set of six different games for varying numbers of players. Aside from one game (which is essentially a solitaire puzzle) they are all based on the principle of changing the arrangement of the plastic chain links to produce sections that match card patterns. There are two different ways of moving the plastic pieces - one link can be unhooked at one end and dragged to a new position, or a section of the chain can be unlinked and reversed - one of which is used in any particular game. There are also two different ways of setting up the links at the start of the game. In theory other games could be played by mixing and matching these rules and other game aspects (how stringent the pattern matching is, for example).<br/><br/>",

This changes the game considerably as it eliminates the role of strategy about future battles, which is an important element of Havoc.<br/><br/>",

It was sold in boxes that contained just half of the pitch, balls, a complete team, coach, bench, referee and a goal.<br/><br/>The plastic figures were made by a round and hollow flat base into which the actual figure (different poses according to their role) had to be pressed in. Colours represented teams of the Italian Serie A of the time, so you could buy your favourite team. To play you needed at least two boxes in order to form the complete playing area. The figures were flicked more or less as in Subbuteo. The most used ball was a semi-spheric one, because the round one was too difficult to control properly.<br/><br/>Don't remember if there was a set of rules in the box or if we just made our own<br/><br/>A few months later, at the end of 1973, Atlantic published the Super GiocaGoal.

        "description": "&quot;There&rsquo;s something alien in Deep Space Outpost 233-B, and it&rsquo;s hungry. Will you figure out how to neutralize it before it eats you?&quot;<br/><br/>Space Monster is a cooperative exploration / suspense / combat game for one to five players. Your goal is to figure out the space monster&rsquo;s weaknesses and stop it before it eats everyone on the space station &ndash; including you! This brings up an important point: The game is actually only mostly cooperative. if things get really dire, you can make a run for the sole one-person escape pod. If you escape and the monster eats everyone else, you win!<br/><br/>During play, you search the outpost for weapons and items to help you neutralize the monster.  You may also have to go to specific rooms to perform tasks, like restarting the failing generator, pumping up the life support system, or overriding the safety systems on the airlock.  Each player gets one action per turn and an allotment of movement points.  The monster also gets at least one action and move every turn.<br/><br/>Space Monster uses a modular, card-based board, special powers for each player, a deck of special powers for the monster, and an unusual deck-based hit point system for the monster.  When the monster takes damage, it loses cards from its health deck.  When all damage is dealt, the instructions on the card on top the the discarded health cards tells you how the monster reacts.  If you draw the special Dying Gasp card, you know the monster is almost dead.<br/><br/>Space Monster is a fairly complex game. As such, it is appropriate for ages 14 and up. A 4-player game takes about 60+ minutes to play, although your first game may take significantly longer.<br/><br/>The rules, cards, and tokens you need to play are all available as a 240 KB PDF at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/file_download/139/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/file_download/139/</a><br/><br/>",

The player with the highest card of each suit wins the other cards of that suit that were also played during that hand. If there is only one of a suit, it is compared to the other individual cards and the player with the highest card collects them all.<br/><br/>At the start of the turn, you must decide what you are playing for. You can try and simply collect the most cards or go for a specific color, suit or the least amount of cards. The more specific you option the more points you get at the end of the round, which occurs once all cards have been played.<br/><br/>The game is played to a specific amount of points and once a player reaches that number, they are declared the winner.<br/><br/>The current rules for the game include the variants Anarchist Bomb, which has more bids and the role of the Anarchist, and Organized Chaos which has a fixed 10-round structure in which each player must make each bid once.<br/><br/>",

Easy to understand Dueling rules are included on the backside of 3 the Attribute Cards and on both sides of the Reference card.<br/><br/>The Demo Deck contains the following 3 unique cards and 27 reprints from other sets:<br/><br/><br/>     Unique Body Attribute Card (strength 8)with instructions on reverse<br/>     Unique Mind Attribute Card (strength 8) with instructions on reverse<br/>     Unique Attribute X card (strength 4) with instructions on reverse<br/>     Standard double-sided reference card<br/>     26 Action Cards reprinted from 24 different decks, games and expansions.<br/><br/><br/>A Herocard Duel is the main conflict resolution mechanic of any Herocard game.<br/><br/>The players have 3 cards in place as reference, Body, Mind and Attribute X. Each card lists the amount of that attribute that is allowed to be played during a given turn. Each character within the various Herocard games contains a unique combination of attributes.<br/><br/>The attacking player lays a basic attack up to the ammount allowed by the corresponding attribute (most basic attacks use points in Body). The defending player may then play a basic defense card.<br/><br/>The attacking player may continue taking turns adding modifiers to that attack which the defending player may opt to modify his block to defend against.<br/><br/>If the total amount of the attack is greater than the total amount of the block, then the attack goes through. If the block is greater it is not successful.<br/><br/>The attacker's turn is now over and he may not recover any spent points until the beginning of his next turn.<br/><br/>The following turn begins with the next player clearing no more than 3 cards (always chosen from the top of the played stacks) and regaining those attribute points to spend. If the defender played more than 3 cards, he will have to leave one of the cards  uncleared and will not regain the full points in whatever attribute the card was left in.<br/><br/>In a Herocard game such as Orcwars or Rise of the Shogun, a player may move his pieces on the board which dictate who is eligible to be attacked. The purpose of the demo deck however is to familiarize the player with the deck dueling mechanics and has no board game associated with it. Player two is free to attack the other player or save points to counter the next attack. Either way, the duel is over at the first strike.<br/><br/>Action cards from the demo deck can be used in conjunction with any other action cards to create customized decks to expand any of the HeroCard titles. Each of the four characters from Tablestar's current Herocard games comes with a unique set of action cards thematically oriented to that game. The demo deck makes customized characters easy without disrupting currently existing decks.<br/><br/>",

O&rsquo;Reilly hints on play, formations, combat, and much more&hellip;.<br/><br/>&lsquo;61-&lsquo;65 is our American Civil War ruleset, written by Sergio Laliscia. It plays at company level, meaning that a player controls a company (98 men in the game) and one figure is one man. The models move and fight as units of 4-8 men each. Smaller games can be played (with about 50 figures per player) and of course with enough players, large tables, and plenty of time, you can play much larger actions!<br/><br/>Figures as independently based but we suggest using magnetic trays for rank and file to speed up movement. Skirmishers are independent figures. Command figures are on a separate stand containing a leader figure, a drummer and a flag-bearer. <br/>Other leaders are single-based. Skirmishers are represented by two single figures in front of a rank and file unit.<br/><br/>Confusion/disorder in units is represented by turning the disordered figures with their back to the enemy. As corporals rally them back in line, they can recover and be turned back to face the enemy. Casualties are represented by removing figures.

The game was first published in the Decktet Book.<br/><br/>The player who leads a trick with a two-suited card picks one of the card's two suits, and other players must follow that suit. However, the second suit on a card might still be trump - so it's possible to follow non-trump suit and trump in at the same time.<br/><br/>Bidding is in broad categories, with the possible bids being none of the tricks, some of the tricks, or most of the tricks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Roman antiquity this game was known as Alea, meaning 'gambling', but came to be called Tabula, 'board' or 'table', since it was played on a board.<br/><br/>Tabula was an ancestor to Backgammon, and has a similar board and style of play to Backgammon.<br/><br/>Tabula was a gambling game of which the Roman Emperor Claudius was most fond. Around the year 50, Claudius wrote a history of the game of Tabula which, unfortunately, has not survived. His imperial carriage was equipped with an alveus, a Tabula playing board, so that he could play while traveling.<br/><br/>Tabula was also the game which was primarily responsible for the gambling mania which swept Rome prior to its being declared illegal under the Republic. The fine for gambling at any other time except the Saturnalia was four times the stakes, although this law was only weakly and sporadically enforced.<br/><br/>The equipment for Tabula is the same as in Backgammon except that each player has three dice instead of two.<br/><br/>All of the pieces start off the board in Tabula. Both players enter their fifteen pieces into the same starting table and move them around the board in the same direction.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to move all of your pieces to the finishing table and then bear them off. The first player to bear off all his pieces wins the game.<br/><br/>",

If a player receives a matching pair of animal cards, remove these from the game as they are not needed. Shuffle the challenge cards and place them in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player draws the topmost challenge card &ndash; with challenges being something that you draw or describe or imitate, e.g., &quot;describe the animal's feet&quot;, &quot;using your fingers, mimic how the animal walks&quot; or &quot;describe or show how the animal eats&quot;. This player draws the topmost animal card from her deck, then completes the challenge as best she can. Each other player then looks through their personal deck of animal cards, chooses one animal they think best matches the description or sounds given, then reveal these cards simultaneously. If someone has matched the active player, those two cards are removed from play; likewise, if any two players have revealed matching animals, those cards are removed from play. All other animals are returned to their owners' decks. The next player then undergoes a challenge, and so on.<br/><br/>As soon as one or more players have no animal cards remaining, the game ends and those players win.<br/><br/>In the two-player game, each player takes a set of animal cards and they take turns doing the challenges. If the non-active player reveals the right animal card, those cards are removed from play; otherwise, the challenger's card and the matching card from the other player's deck are placed in the middle of the table as a penalty point. The goal is to score as few penalty points as possible.<br/><br/>",

The island is teeming with hazards, from the treacherous Tall Peak to the deadly Raging River.  Enemies abound on Pirate Island: Headhunters, Skeletons, and - of course - Pirates.<br/><br/>But there is hope.  There is a rumor of a treasure buried on Pirate Island.  If you and your friends can navigate through the hazards and avoid or kill the enemies, then maybe you can follow the treasure map and find the treasure.   Then you could sneak aboard the docked pirate ship and Escape From Pirate Island!<br/><br/>Pirate Island is a cooperative game of exploration and risk management.  Your characters move around Pirate Island uncovering new hexes which could be helpful or hazardous.  You need to manage your food and resources, running out of either can be dangerous, and you need to fight or escape from deadly enemies.<br/><br/>You also need to find the hexes that contain clues to the treasure map, and then, once you have the treasure, you need to get to the lagoon to board the pirate ship to escape.  And you need to do it before time -- represented by the event deck -- runs out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game offers extremely easy accessibility, fun interaction, strategic gameplay, and diverse experiences. All you need is a standard deck of cards, the rules, one or more friends willing to learn the game and want to have fun.<br/><br/>Players start with a group of survivors, represented by the cards in their hand. Each turn, which represents a normal day, consists of gathering resources, creating defenses, expanding the group's strength, battling other groups of survivors, and of course killing zombies. Throughout the game, players use card combinations in order to experience unique scenarios like fighting against zombie hordes, training up soldiers, and even witnessing their own members turn zombie. The simplistic nature of this game offers great entertainment and interaction between players, yet it provides enough challenge and diversity to keep you playing over and over.<br/><br/>In order to win, players must survive through the deck by increasing the amount of cards in their hand. This is accomplished by gathering Resources, killing Zombies, creating Defenses, and battling other players. When the last card of the deck is drawn, each player takes a final turn. Then players count the remaining cards in their hand and keep track of that score. After three rounds of Outlast, whoever has the highest total score wins and has &ldquo;Outlasted&rdquo; everyone.<br/><br/>While the mechanics of this game is simple, the complex part of this game is that each card has a different value, whether it represents zombies, gas, food, defense, guns, or more. Combinations with different cards also add an extra layer of strategy as players must decide what to play to help themselves and hurt others.<br/><br/>The game offers an instruction manual, a place matt, specific player inventory cards, and player help charts (to keep track of the different card values). Each piece is designed beautifully and all work together to give the player an imaginative experience. Being sold at a low price, because of not offering a custom deck, this game calls out to all types of game players who want to play a fun game.<br/><br/>",

Only a handful of people survived the disaster and the following mutiny...<br/><br/>Every player plays the skipper of a VOC ship. The starting player will roll the die determining how many spaces everybody gets to move. If a player ends his move in a port they can stock up on goods (for free). If a player ends in the Home port he can unload his goods thereby securing them from the pirate and the other players. And if a player lands next to another player he can attack them (high roller wins, difference in roll is the amount of goods that can be stolen).<br/><br/>Secured goods can be used to buy parts of a players own Batavia which also yields an advancement for the players current VOC ship.<br/>After a player has build his own Batavia, he will have to sail it from the Home port to Batavia city to win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Since 1568, the north and south sides of Pisa (Tramontana und Mezzogiorno) compete yearly on the Il Gioco del Ponte - the battle for the bridge. Which strategy will lead your side to victory? What surprises do your opponents have in store for you? Only the most cunning players will overcome their opponent's assault and be declared the king of the bridge!<br/><br/>The boardgame implementation of this spectacle is a collector's item and artistic masterpiece, in which each of the figures is handmade and hand-painted. You pick a side and engage in a thrilling battle with two, three, four or six players. You'll have to divide your strength wisely, and adjust to the strategy of your opponents, in order to also push the handmade (and in real life seven ton) cart to the other side of the river.<br/><br/>How do you play?<br/><br/>The board game is based heavily on the real-world Il Gioco del Ponte event. There are always two sides competing against each other, and the basic rules of the two-player game also apply to the higher player counts. In the two-player version, each player selects a side (Tramontana or Mezzogiorno) and distributes their strength points across six districts. <br/>To start a round, each player picks a magistrature. During one round, players choose one attack card each. A rock-paper-scissor-mechanism decides which player is to act, the winner moves the cart and both players loose strenght equal to the chosen attack cards and each chooses a new attack card. A round is over, if one side has no strenght left or if the cart is pushed completely to the opposite side. A game contains of at 6 rounds, a tie-braker decides in case of a tie. Strategy cards might be played as well to change the effects o the attack cards.<br/><br/>The Italian and English version are already available, for the German version there is a crowdfunding campaign running until July 5th 2015.<br/><br/>",

Players are required to work closely together and use each other's individual strengths to defeat classic opponents from medieval fantasy tales and, as a team, prevent the destruction of the mythic kingdom!<br/><br/>Each player chooses one of ten classic and recognizable characters: a knight, a barbarian, an elf, a wizard, a princess, and so on. Each character has a specific combination of skills, represented by colorful icons, that can be used to defeat monsters along the way; stars represent physical might, while books stand for lore and hearts embody social skills. As the right combination of skill icons is required to defeat monsters and eventually dethrone the main villain of the piece. By doing this, children not only see that they differ from the other players, they even need to make good use of the other players' strengths &mdash; and help them cope with their weaknesses &mdash; to succeed.<br/><br/>Players start off in the idyllic medieval kingdom, where they'll confront weaker monsters drawn randomly from a stack of encounters while also traveling from one location to the next. When they feel up to it, certain locations give them access to the evil Shadowrealm, where stronger monsters roam but ancient, powerful magics can also be discovered. In this realm of darkness and shadow, they eventually have to defeat the one, powerful creature who has been organizing the monsters for an all-out assault on the kingdom...<br/><br/>Figment is ideal for young children and was developed in cooperation with educators and elementary school teachers.<br/><br/>",

Soult's plan was to defeat Beresford and therefore relieve the British siege of Badajoz. A Spanish contingent, however, had just united with Beresford, and the combined British, Portuguese, and Spanish force now outnumbered the French. Soult attacked anyway, and his plan to outflank the enemy worked well - in the beginning&hellip; but a determined defense ultimately repulsed the attack.  Can you as Soult decisively prevail against the Allies or as Beresford falter and flounder in the face of French aggression?  You decide in this realistic Napoleonic battle game.<br/><br/>Albuera 16th May, 1811 is the 1st Volume in the Napoleonic Battlefield Series (NBS).  NBS portrays Napoleonic battles at the regiment or brigade level, giving players a sense of the historical era without overloading with rules and procedures.   Rules include ranged artillery bombardment, cavalry counter-charges, random special events, disruption and recovery, and the importance of leaders and command.<br/><br/>This is old-fashioned beer &amp; pretzels wargaming, designed to be enjoyed in an evening.

The game should take under 5 minutes to play and is presented in a book format so it is easy to take with you and store on a shelf.<br/><br/>The game has players rolling dice, moving along a collapsing tiled room, collecting treasure, and avoiding fire from the dragon statues.

        "description": "User summary<br/>コプラス (KoPlus) is an abstract game themed on far future Earth, where players compete to capture a space being known as 'KoPlus', which are Cosmic Fireflies.<br/><br/>A simple game played on a modular board, where you play a tile to capture the most points. However, the game gets crunchy with the rules forcing you to play the 2 tiles alternatively, and failing to connect your tiles would grant you devastating penalty points.<br/><br/>Meeting some conditions may grant you a powerful &quot;consecutive play&quot;. When to launch the move is also a tough decision.<br/><br/>The game board is modular, and changes according to the number of players: 2 player is 3x3, 3 player is 3x4, and 4 player is 4x4 board pieces.<br/><br/>The name KoPlus comes from the two game pieces, pentominos in a cup shape that looks like the sound 'Ko' in katakana (コ), and a plus shape (+). Put them together and you get KoPlus!<br/><br/>The players take turns placing their pieces, connected to any pieces on a side. One player places in コ + コ + order, the next places in + コ + コ order, and so on. At the end of the game, if a player has been able to connect their own pieces together well, they get bonus points. But having their pieces scattered gets them negative points.<br/><br/>As the game progesses, players try to place their pieces to cover the scoring squares on the board. Maximum scoring is nine points in a turn, and players must make legal moves even if they won't score. The game ends when no more legal moves are open.<br/><br/>There is an extra move available when a player hits 20, 40 and 60 points scored. They get a right to have an extra move immediately. This not only increases their scoring opportunities, it can also help them break out of a difficult position.<br/><br/>The game is a mix of planning and opportunity, and has been very popular in Japan after its release at the Tokyo Game Market in Spring 2017. Game design is by GameNOWA and production design is by SukiGames. The game designer originally styled the game name in Romaji as 'COPULAS', but settled on KoPlus as a better name.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>コプラスは、遠い未来の地球を舞台に、宇宙ホタルと呼ばれる宇宙生命体コプラスを捕まえるアブストラクトゲームです。<br/>手番に1枚、モジュラーボードにタイルを置いてなるべく多くの点数を稼ぐ簡単なゲームですが、2種類のタイルを交互に置く縛りや、タイルをちょうどよく繋げないと大失点を被るルールから、終了時の盤面を強く意識して手を進める必要がある歯ごたえのあるゲームです。<br/>条件を満たすことで使える強力な行動、「連続手番」をどのタイミングで使うかも重要なポイントです。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Fairies are having their Fair, and it's exactly as magical as it sounds! What's not so magical is the intense planning that goes into making the annual event a success. This year, the fairies have turned to YOU, fair impresario extraordinaire, to bring together all the elements needed for the grand occasion. Fail, and you'll let down not only the fairies, but all the kids of the various assorted fantasy races who have been looking forward to this magical night all year long.<br/><br/>Fairy Fair is a solitaire, print-and-play, roll-and-write game that takes place in the Legends of Dsyx fantasy setting.<br/><br/>The player will roll dice to build various stalls and attractions inside a grid representing the fair grounds. Don't like what you've rolled? Roll again! Unlike in most roll-and-write games, players have UNLIMITED rerolls to make sure they get the fair just right. Unlimited, that is... until doubles come up, at which point the turn immediately ends without the chance to build anything at all. Sorry, but life isn't &quot;fair!&quot;<br/><br/>Once the time track representing the approach of opening night is completely filled in, however, is when the games -- and game -- REALLY begins. Now, the player must guide the revelers along the choicest path through the fair, stopping at the various attractions to play carnival games, eat fanciful foods, and ride the many magical rides. Attractions alongside this path will flourish, while those that receive no foot traffic will need to close.<br/><br/>Only those sights that remain open at the end of the fair will score points, and only by scoring high will the fairies even consider hiring you for the job again next year.<br/><br/><br/>Released in the September 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

The game is played in 5 rounds in which each player is dealing with the same villain.  Each player must either arrest the villain, leave the conflict to protect citizens, or get defeated.<br/><br/>Players place power cards, talent cards, health tokens, die tokens, energy tokens, and weapon cards in a drafting area of the board. Players can then either draft each round (which includes buying weapons, buying powers, and buying talents with energy tokens) or attempt to arrest the villain.<br/><br/>When a player arrests the villain, he gets a bonus power, contact, or other token or card choice--the first player to arrest the villain gets first pick.<br/><br/>Each round has a new, stronger villain.  If a player is defeated, he leaves the round and gets a consolation prize of health and energy to help with the next round.<br/><br/>Victory points are gained as the arrest takes place and bonus points are part of the options for victorious heroes. The player with the most points at the end of 5 rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Havana Dice is a stylish Cuban twist on the traditional bluffing game of Liar's Dice, also known as Dudo. Roll the dice in this push-your-luck game that is at once fast-paced and easy-to-learn.<br/><br/>Using poker dice and unique dice cups, players roll their own dice in secret before bidding on the number of dice under everyone's cups&mdash;but if a bluff is successfully called, the bluffer loses a die.<br/><br/>Poker chips act as wild dice. A player may discard them when their bid is called to act as a die with the value of their bid. Once a call is made, but before players reveal their dice, the bidder must announce that they are using one or more of their poker chips and discard them. Every discarded poker chip counts as one die of the current value.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TorKings is the game connoisseur&rsquo;s (geek-worthy) extreme upgrade of the classic game of alignment.<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s new rules, new game options and hardware from the distant future. It's now a whole lot more than the old game of line up 4!<br/><br/>The games now range from the classic game of Align4 (4 in a row) to TorLord &ndash; the creative mode where you win title of TorLord or TorKing and the right to change and evolve your own rules of engagement with a diversified set of tokens.<br/><br/>In between those games are the games of TorGalor and TorKings &ndash; both radical and massive improvements to the game of alignment that truly unleash the genre&rsquo;s strategic depth and gameplay diversity to the next level.<br/><br/>Then there&rsquo;s the new interactive cooperative team play mode that blows the dynamics out of the water even further.   A game mode that really hits the sweet spot with satisfying, engaging fun for families and friends.<br/>New Developmental Tool:  With both enhanced strategy games and interactive cooperative team play, TorKings is a new cross purposed STEM and Social IQ building tool.  Idea for developing minds and team building alike.<br/><br/>The Geek Spectrum:  TorKings gameplay is adaptive to suit the full spectrum of players. Pick your board size, pick your game and pick your team.  Wherever you lie on the spectrum &ndash; there&rsquo;s a game option to suit.<br/><br/>As immersive and fun as good Euro-games are they are unfortunately cursed by lengthy rules that are difficult to access, long gameplay and lengthy setup.<br/><br/>TorKings is a complete matrix of game options to suit your occasion. The rules are super accessible, the game depth is selectable from newb to guru, the game duration is also selectable, the setup practically instant, you can play on a single, double or triple sized board and you can play one-on-one or play interactively in teams! &ndash; That&rsquo;s one freaking convenient and dynamic piece of gameware!<br/><br/>So players of all ages can dive into the fun of the game of their choice in no time. &ndash; Quick, easy, super engaging and a load of fun!<br/><br/>Way Back: The classic game of alignment goes back 5 decades (released as Connect4 in 1974). It&rsquo;s one of the most popular board games in the western world.  We&rsquo;ve either grown up with it (or a clone) or we&rsquo;ve been adults with kids who have played it to infinity and beyond.<br/><br/>But it&rsquo;s a classic - so why change it?  The answer is that the gameplay is massively underdeveloped!<br/>The telling proof of that is the general attrition of the game by the time players hit their tweens. Albeit - they then grow up and return to the game for a similar time period with their own kids!<br/><br/>The reasons for tween attrition are many but the most important factor is that the gameplay of chasing a single alignment is not strategically rich enough to maintain interest for naturally expanding minds.  It&rsquo;s too confined, too routine and lacks diversity.  If only those problems could be fixed&hellip;<br/><br/>By comparison other strategic games like Go and Chess have a good following as minds mature.  Those games have the strategic richness to match and engage evolving minds.<br/>But how do you make the game of alignment strategically richer to engage growing and mature minds? The answer is layered but here are the basic elements of the solution: <br/>1.    Kill the sudden death approach. <br/>   &bull;    Getting a single alignment is fun.  But getting multiple alignments is a lot more fun - so in the new rules a side wins by getting the most alignments in a game.<br/>   &bull;    That finally opens up the new possibility of getting more points for multiple alignments.<br/>   &bull;    As the game plays on through alignments there is a far richer move and counter-move dynamic set up.   The dynamic shift to achieving the more dynamic multiple alignments while of course blocking the bigger game or your opponent.<br/>   &bull;    Such a simple and obvious rule change &ndash; but with a massive cascade of instantly compounding strategic depth and dynamics<br/>&bull;    You now also get paid for each new alignment you make - from your opponents unplayed tokens.  That&rsquo;s also the super simple way you keep score! Again super satisfying and adding another layer of risk management, separation anxiety and competitive dynamics. &ndash; Genius!<br/>2.    Expand the game board size<br/>   &bull;    Modular board games allow the board to get wider and that finally allows the strategic development to expand.  The result - a massive increase in player engagement and satisfaction.<br/>3.    Introduce a diversity of token characters with new properties to meaningfully contribute to the gameplay and diversify game options further.  A satisfying upgrade for seasoned strategists.<br/>4.    Open up interactive co-op team play<br/>   &bull;    The modular boards are a total natural fit for others to join and play interactive cooperative team games.  The result is a further cascade in dynamics as the human element is introduced.  It&rsquo;s easily one of the most fun ways to play. It&rsquo;s also one of the most accessible co-op styled board-games in the world! A true contender that may finally bring cooperative styled boardgaming into the mainstream!<br/>Flexibility: The options above can be toggled on or off in different game options to allow players to grow into the new gameplay levels.  Combining all of the above entirely unleashes the true potential of the strategic alignment genre.  Once you play the new games it feels strange indeed that it&rsquo;s taken 5 decades to finally make this most obvious transition.<br/><br/>The Revolutionary New Hardware:<br/>   &bull;    Smart Tokens: Now your tokens finally sort themselves and shoot straight back at you at the press of a button.  That gives you more game time and turns the tedious task of manually sorting tokens into a magic treat for everyone, every game!<br/>   &bull;    Modular Gameboards: Players can now join up to 3 boards together to make a bigger fully integrated board.  The result is a massive boost to gameplay diversity and depth.<br/>   &bull;    Iconic 3D tokens:  We&rsquo;ve turned design thinking inside out when we developed the TorKings tokens.  They are a mixture of sculpted 3D forms and voids beautifully framed by the surrounding torus.  They are a breakthrough in visual accessibility that allows token diversity to explode along with gameplay depth.  They are also very tactile and visually stunning in the game grid.<br/>   &bull;    Snap Latch : We&rsquo;ve put an end to the violation of your tokens randomly releasing in the middle of your game.  The snap latch snaps shut and secures your game.<br/>   &bull;    Spinners:  The tokens can spin in a variety of ways.  They are handy as timers, selectors and impressively cool play things in their own right.<br/>   &bull;    Safety:  The tokens re designed to allow airflow regardless of orientation in an airway. That allows parents to breathe a little easier when younger kids inadvertently wander into the mix.<br/>   &bull;    Premium Quality: We&rsquo;ve designed the game to be a very different premium journey for players of all ages. It&rsquo;s a completely new level of enjoyment and fun.<br/><br/>Description from the designer - James T.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/><br/>This book represents Brimstone the Fire Giant a character in the Lost Worlds Series of combat picture games, and is playable with all other books that carry the Lost Worlds logo.  each book is unique and has its own special qualities.  Collect them and discover for yourself their magic.<br/><br/>(From the booklet:  Lost Worlds: &quot;Brimstone&quot; the Fire Giant)<br/><br/>",

The original plans were uninspiring and his generals feared an attritional stalemate. Over the winter the Germans keep taking the measure of their opponents and hit upon a plan was that inspired, risky, and utterly decisive. Ironic of Hitler to assume his remarkable success was simply the new template for all future campaigns. His eyes turned east.<br/><br/>But why, exactly, did France fall? Against the Odds 2017 Annual  features four top designers all tasked with re-examining the 1940 campaign and answering that very question.<br/><br/>'Betrayal!' is a strategic level game of the German invasion of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands in May 1940. After <br/>finishing campaigns in Poland, Denmark, and Norway, Hitler turned to France. The goal was to knock France down and <br/>then prepare for the subjugation of Britain and the invasion of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Pre-war planning, coupled with valuable experience gained in Poland, would lead the Wehrmacht to excel in lightning <br/>warfare never before seen on such a massive scale. While the French had re-visited World War One with a static Maginot <br/>Line defending their border, the Germans went beyond this and brought in blitzkrieg. There were a few bumps along the <br/>way. The smaller British army and those from tiny Belgium and Netherlands tried to help France.<br/><br/>The game has two Allied players, one French and one British. They will alternate, depending on initiative, in handling <br/>the automata German side. Internal differences between the allies can arise according to their separate and unique victory conditions.<br/><br/>",

Shuffle and randomly add 2 of them each game, with one face-up to start. When adding a card to the Lesson Row from your hand, you may play a face-up Tackle card as well. Tackle cards cover an existing Lesson card and replace it with a powerful action for the turn before being discarded to reveal the original Lesson. After playing a Tackle card, flip the other one face-up and play it on a subsequent turn. Play both before the game ends or you'll miss the boat!<br/><br/><br/>A tackle card is played on top of an existing lesson card. When Step 2 is resolved, the actions on the tackle card are resolved &ndash;and then the tackle card is discarded right after it is finished. In this way, the tackle card replaces that lesson card only for the one turn, and in the next turn the lesson card underneath would be available again. The tackle card must be placed on top of a lesson card, and cannot be played on its own. The tackle card cannot be played on top of the lesson card added during the same round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pick a hero and fight for your life! One-Hit Heroes is a co-operative boss rush game where your team must defeat the boss without getting hit even once. The more bosses you defeat, the more your Armory improves as you unlock more card variety each time you play an Episode.<br/><br/>Each boss has a custom deck of moves to try and land hits on your team, but each of you have a unique hero deck with your own tools for blocking, dodging and damaging the boss.<br/><br/>Defeat bosses to be rewarded with card packs that you can tear open and draft from. Each card pack will let you power up and specialize your hero further for the rest of the Episode. But in order to defeat the final boss of each Episode, you'll need more than just a refined deck - you'll need to play your cards carefully and work as a team to survive long enough to win.<br/><br/>Each turn has four phases: SCOUT, where you reveal the Boss's next move; FIGHT, where you play up to three cards; REST, where you redraw to five cards and clear your playing space; and SURVIVE, where you resolve the Boss Turn. When your life hangs by a thread, you want to defeat the boss before it has time to land a lucky hit - however, each damage you deal increases your Aggro, making you more vulnerable and making the boss even stronger. That means you can't simply DPS your way to victory &mdash; you'll also need to manage your Aggro and find ways to block with Items to avoid getting Hit.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s easy to learn and easy to play. There are 2 types of cards: the Emotion Cards, and the Sentence Cards. You&rsquo;ll choose 1 card from each stack and then deliver the sentence aloud for everyone to hear.<br/><br/>How do you say, &ldquo;Great news everyone, I got engaged today&rdquo; in your best sad voice? ...or... &quot;That guy just sneezed all over you&quot; in a voice full of Happiness?<br/><br/>Other players will have to guess which Emotion you are using. Here&rsquo;s the catch &ndash; no one except you knows which Emotion card you drew, the Sentence and Emotion rarely match, and you only get 1 shot at your delivery.<br/><br/>It's a science experiment of your brain vs your mouth. Emotional IQ is designed by Bryan Sloan and illustrated by Roman Shipunov.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are a merchant in the famous Exponentia market, capital of magic. Every day, among a multitude of strange objects and ingredients, hundreds of items coveted by all witches are sold in order to cook their magic potions. Harpy blood, crowfoot, frog legs, glass eyes, unicorn horn are just some of the items that witches will mix in their old cauldrons.<br/><br/>Trade items with the rest of the Exponentia merchants, mislead your rivals, while deducing which witches will come to buy. Fill your sack with Patacabr&euro;uros before anyone else to win the game!<br/><br/>Pata de Cabra is a family party for 2 to 6 players, recommended from 8 years old and with an approximate duration of 25 minutes.<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>In Pata de Cabra, with cunning and a bit of mischief, you will have to be the first merchant to fill your bag of Patacabr &euro; uros to win the game, selling the witches the items they need to put in their cauldron to make the magic potions. When they all hit the market, it will be time to sell.<br/><br/>Take out your merchant skills to convince other players and get rid of the items you do not want. If you are a good merchant, you will get the hand that will make you fill your sack with Patacabr &euro; uros.<br/><br/>Being able to mislead the rest of the players is essential to achieve victory. Only one will become the best merchant in Exponentia.<br/><br/>In Pata de Cabra we will find 5 types of elements, each of them related to a witch:<br/><br/>Goat's Leg - Black Witch<br/><br/>Harpy Blood - Red Witch<br/><br/>Frog Legs - Green Witch<br/><br/>Glass Eye - Blue Witch<br/><br/>Unicorn Horn - Yellow Witch<br/><br/>HOW DOES IT PLAY?<br/><br/>The player with the most witch's face is in charge of preparing the game. He will distribute a Patacabr &euro; uros sack tablet and a coin counter that we will place at number 0 on the tablet. The Patacabr &euro; uros must be earned! You will separate the cards into two decks, the element deck and the witch deck. In addition, each player will draw 7 item cards and witch cards (it will vary depending on the number of players), and we will be ready to start the first round.<br/><br/>Each round consists of three phases of exchanges. After each exchange phase there will be a witch phase. When a witch is revealed during this phase, her magic will be activated immediately.<br/><br/>After the third and final witch phase, the round will end with the sale phase, where the Patacabr &euro; uros will be earned.<br/><br/>Watch out! Not all items can be sold for the same value. The power that a single element contains is so enormous that only two expert witches will be able to extract its power for the spell to work and the potion to be carried out successfully. If there are three, the power of the elements could be destabilized causing the cauldron to explode, it would be a risk that only some witches would dare to take if they are made a generous offer. Depending on the number of witches on the table at the end of the round, the items will be sold for one value or another.<br/><br/>When someone collects 25 Patacabr &euro; uros, or more, the game is over. The best merchant in Exponentia wins!<br/><br/>If after the first round no one has collected at least 25 Patacabr &euro; uros, continue the game and start another new round with the market day.<br/><br/>",

The game&rsquo;s sub-systems are crafted to present a supreme-commander&rsquo;s-eye-view of the war: it is therefore almost fully strategic in its perspective, with only the most pastel of operational undertones added to enhance historical tone and texture. Each hex on the map represents 16 miles (26 km). Each full turn of play represents four days of real time. Units of maneuver are corps with army HQ also being represented. Static fortresses also play an important role in play. One player commands the German forces. The other player commands the Entente forces (Belgian, British, and French) which are allied with each other, in opposition to the Germans.&quot;<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters<br/><br/>Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #319<br/><br/>",

The two games resemble each other, but Shatranj is different enough that they can be considered two distinct games, even though it is Shatranj that Europeans first called &quot;chess&quot;.<br/><br/>The main differences between shatranj and modern chess are that the earlier game had a vizier instead of a queen, and an elephant instead of a bishop, and these pieces had much more limited movement than their modern counterparts.  The pawn also lacked the double-step introductory move it has today, and furthermore, there was no castling.<br/><br/>While all this sounds very limiting, it can make a refreshing change from modern chess.  Modern openings must be left behind, and the pace of the game is a little slower, the limited movement of the pieces allowing defenses to be set up before the opponent approaches to destroy them.<br/><br/>Shatranj Kamil was an early and largely unsuccessful attempt to expand the game of Shatranj.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes turns as the Delegator, trying to eliminate all the Tasks in their hand by giving them to other players based on each Task&rsquo;s required Department abilities.<br/><br/>Players can bluff about whether they are in the proper Department to take a Task, but be careful! If the Delegator believes a player is bluffing, they can call HR, which could have dire consequences for any players caught falsifying information.<br/><br/>This tongue-in-cheek card game is quick, clever, and strategic.

The rules set provides a complete rules for conducting battles in Europe between 1808 and 1858.<br/><br/>This rules system is ideal for the beginning miniatures wargamer.  The rulebook is only 6&quot;x9&quot; in size with the text printed in single column to a page.  They are concise an easy to understand while still modeling the effects of warfare accurately.<br/><br/>The only thing the rules are a little thin on is command and control.  The system assumes that all units activate orders automatically.  However, this is a good thing for beginning wargamers (less to think about your first time out!).  You can always add your own C&amp;C rules.<br/><br/>GDW also included a 6&quot;x9&quot; organization book and charts in their boxed set.  These detailed the organization, quality, capabilities, and how to mount the figures for each unit that fought in Europe during the Napoleonic era.  Again, this makes the system easier for the beginner to learn as they don't have to do a lot of research.<br/><br/>Fire and Steel regulates the size of bases and terrain on a pure ground scale.  The board played on depicts terrain at a ground scale of 1&quot; = 25 yds.  The size of the minis bases are dependent on how much frontage the unit occupied, not abstracted like other minis games.<br/><br/>Also see GDW's sister rules set called System 7 Napoleonics.  For the most part, the two rules sets are identical.  Really, the only differences are the ground scale (1&quot;=40 yards in System 7) and use of paper counters to replace miniatures.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Unthinkable, designed by Ty Bomba, allows one or two players to explore the possible outcomes inherent in the campaign that would&rsquo;ve resulted had Winston Churchill&rsquo;s plan for starting World War III in July 1945 been put into effect. For that to have happened, two changes in the timeline need have taken place during the first half of that year.<br/><br/>First, Churchill would&rsquo;ve had to put off the British general election until after Japan was defeated. He had the political leverage to do that, but against all good advice he chose not to do so. He mistakenly believed the recent victory over Nazi Germany was enough to sustain his coalition government in power.<br/><br/>Second, he would have had to convince US President Harry Truman, then only recently come into office after the death of FDR, that preemptive war against the Soviets was the best choice among a limited number of strategic options. A close study of the debate that went on historically within the White House and Pentagon at the time concerning the idea indicates that, by March 1946, those Washington powerbrokers had become convinced a new World War &ndash; with the USSR as the primary enemy &ndash; was indeed coming and coming soon. Had that conviction taken hold in Washington just eight months sooner &ndash; and it well might have, had Stalin or Tito been only a little more aggressive in their territorial and political demands &ndash; this would not be an alternative history design.<br/><br/>The general flow of the game inescapably has the Allies on the offensive at its start. On the Soviet side, that player is immediately faced with a decision to either &ldquo;fight forward,&rdquo; with Berlin as the central core of that gambit, or retreating east with the idea of slowly wearing down the Allied offensive and then counterattacking into its flanks late in the game. Further, though the Allies have the ability to make paradrops and amphibious invasions, they lack the dedicated manpower necessary to make such gambits automatically decisive. Most games are decided either in and around Berlin or somewhere east of the Oder-Neisse line.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map represents eight miles (13 km) from side to opposite side. Each full game turn represents one week. Each unit of maneuver represents a corps or army. There are 192 medium-size (9/16&rdquo;) units. Complexity is low-intermediate, and a game can be completed in under four hours. The system is solitaire friendly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fallout: Adventures is a fan made card game set in the Fallout universe. Players traverse the lands of post-apocalyptic United States of America, visiting places known from all of the Fallout games. During their adventure, players will meet familiar characters from the game, create teams of followers and gather equipment to aid them in their quest.<br/><br/>The game features all original art by Oskar Potocki, which immitates the style of the PIP Boy 2000 in-game display.<br/><br/>2-4 players start the game by selecting their starting characters and equipment. The health of characters and the condition of equipment is determined by placing a D6 dice on the card with the amount of pips showing the current state of the character/equipment. Players also choose their starting perks, and mission cards.<br/><br/>Missions comprise of three elements: the mission, location and faction (i.e. Fight Ghouls at Tenpenny Tower). Each part of the mission has a check that must be completed by the player in order to complete the mission. If the player can't meet the conditions of the check, they can flee and discard the mission (then they choose a new one). Most of the checks are die rolls which use dice from a wide range i.e. D4, D6, D8, D10, D12 and D20.<br/><br/>Player parties traverse the radioactive lands of North America. The game map shows most of the locations from all of the Fallout games. Locations are interconnected by roads used by players to travel from one site to the other by means of spending action points. Each location lists all of the actions that can be performed there, ie. Trade, Gamble, Easy/Medium/Hard Mission, rest etc. A player may perform one of the actions in their current location, before their turn is over.<br/><br/>Travelling through locations, players will gather followers, who can be recruited in a number of ways, but most often by means of selecting a recruit action if it is available at the party's current location. Players will purchase party members with caps (the game's currency) and add them to their play area. A D6 dice will be then placed on the follower card, showing their current state of health. Players will also gain equipment the same way and will also level up their characters in order to prepare their team for the final mission. The final mission is hard to complete and will require a trully great ensemble of characters which are well equipped and levelled up in order to complete the assignment. Once a player completes their final mission, they win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion pack adds a variant to Dicetopia that forces all players to work together to pull of a massive heist. It can also be enjoyed as a tricky solo challenge.<br/><br/>A Heist Card is drawn at the start of the game with certain conditions that have to be met at the end of the game. So, instead of the normal goal of the game to score points from mission cards, dominating neighbourhoods and scoring dice, the players goal is now to succeed with the Heist Card, as well as completing a private Role Card by having the depicted dice from the card on their Faction Board at the end of the game.<br/><br/>However, the players can't reveal any information regarding what colors or numbers they need for their Role Card while the Heist Card is considered public information and players are allowed to coordinate around it. In order to make all of this work, all player abilities are replaced by allowing to change the value of a die in the city once per game. Also, when performing a neighbourhood action, players now have the option to instead change the value of a die in the city by +1/-1.<br/><br/>",

Nevertheless, in the Autumn of 1914, this is what he attempted.<br/><br/>Serbia/Galicia includes a dual map, which illustrates both major fronts on which the Austro-Hungarians were deployed in 1914. The Austro-Serbian border, from Belgrade to Montenegro, is shown on half the map, while the majority of Galicia, including Lemberg and the crucial Prezmysl-fortress complex, is on the other half.  On the first map area, the Austrian forces must try to make headway against the under-equipped but ferocious Serbs, while on the other, the Russians attempt to make up for the disasters in Prussia by overrunning as much of Galicia as possible.  Special rules cover Serbian supply constraints, Austrian river-monitors, and the transfer of Austrian troops.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Argute is an exciting trick-taking card game. If you like to play cribbage, euchre, hearts, Uno, etc., then this is the new game for you! Many people who have played have commented on how this game works equally well for 2, 3, and 4 or more players. Perfect for inter-generational social events.<br/><br/>The game is intriguingly simple to grasp but allows for unlimited playing experiences.<br/><br/>GOAL The winner is the first to score 6 points or more without being tied with another player. Win points by correctly bidding on the number of tricks you will take.<br/><br/>The ARGUTE card deck is divided into play cards and bid cards. None of the cards have suits. The 42 play cards include 7 cards each of the following denominations: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The 28 bid cards include 7 sets of cards each of 0, 1, 2, 3.<br/><br/>SET-UP To start each player is given a set of 4 bid cards consisting of a 0, 1, 2 &amp; 3, and will hold onto these cards for the duration. The scorekeeper is chosen and the first dealer will be the oldest person playing the game.<br/><br/>BID PHASE The dealer shuffles the play cards and deals 6 cards face down to each player. Each player looks at their &ldquo;play&rdquo; cards and determines how many tricks they will be able to win from zero to three. They then pick the appropriate bid card and place it<br/>FACE DOWN in front of them. Each player only knows their own bid. Once everyone has bid, play begins and no one is allowed to look at any bid cards until the completion of the hand.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY Each 6 card hand is divided into 3 tricks. The first trick consists of 3 cards from every player&rsquo;s hand. The second trick consists of 2 cards from every player&rsquo;s hand. The last trick is 1 card from each player.  Each player only plays one card per turn. The player to the dealer&rsquo;s left leads the first trick. The winner of each trick is the player with the highest total of the cards (ie. Count) played for each separate trick and will lead off the next trick. If two or more players counts are tied, the player who reached the count first wins the trick. (For example, if 4 people are playing and they all play a zero for the last trick (1 card), the player who played the first zero wins the trick.)<br/>At the end of the hand after the three tricks have been won players reveal their bid cards to the table. If a player has correctly bid the number of tricks, she scores that many points. If a player has incorrectly bid the number of tricks he would take, either higher or lower, that player loses one point regardless of his bid. If a player bids zero and gets zero tricks, she neither loses nor gains any points, her score stays the same for that hand.<br/>The deal moves to the left. If two or more players are tied with six or more points at the end of a hand, all players play another hand until only one player leads with six or more.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In terms of territory caputerd and losses inflicted, this offensive was the most successful operation conducted against the Central Powers during the entire war. the failure of the Russians to eliminate the Austro-Hungarians from the war dictated their eventual military collapse, deepening the despair that was a factor in fomenting the &quot;October Revolution&quot; of 1917.<br/>In addition to the historical scenario, several other scenarios have been provided, illustrating various options and possibilities that could have affected the battle.

Initial deal is seven cards in hand plus a displayed Color card.<br/><br/>On your turn, you draw from either deck or from the Play discard. Unless drawing a Color card, you then discard a Play card. If you manage to get all of your hand to match the Color card, you Go Out instead of drawing (you get a 100 point bonus for this). Each player then adds the color-matching cards to his score and subtracts the non-matching ones.<br/><br/>The Skip, Reverse (ignored when playing with just two) and Wild cards are pretty obvious. The Color Change card is used to force another player to do so (play then continues with the player after the victim).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Designer's comment:<br/>Choose Your Own Adventure gamebooks are wonderful things. They contain little paragraphs scattered across the pages in a seemingly chaotic order, each one ending with a set of choices and numbers which take you flicking through the book to the next paragraph in your personal journey through the book.<br/><br/>Which got me thinking. What happens if you make those numbers actually mean something? What if they replaced the paragraphs themselves? And what if you made them random? What would a solitaire game like that be like?<br/><br/>This.<br/><br/>3 Dice<br/><br/>A CYOA solitaire game using just 3 dice and no gamebook<br/><br/>User comment:<br/>This simple solitaire adventure game with dice was a submission for the RPG Solitaire Challenge.<br/><br/>The game is played by rolling three differently coloured six-sided dice.  Using a single die 3 characteristics are rolled and recorded to represent your abilities.  To begin playing the three dice are rolled and each die is referenced against a three column table to determine a location, a monster and a reward.<br/><br/>If a monster exists a die is rolled to determine combat results.  If you win the encounter or the room is empty you total the room dice and record the total as your Experience Reward.  When 50 points have been gained the adventure is over and abilities are reset to their starting values.  Experience can be used to increase an ability by 1 point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Modern War #13, Sept-Oct 2014<br/><br/>&quot;The Next War in Lebanon&quot; is an operational level wargame of a speculative Israeli invasion of Lebanon in the near future. The context is an Israeli invasion with the goal of eliminating the presence of Hezbollah terrorist group, and presumes a much larger invasion than the 2006 incursion (which is also included as a scenario). One player (the IDF) is assigned the role of the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) commander, and the other player is assigned the role of the Hezbollah forces, as well as Syrian and Iranian forces if certain events occur to cause their entry into the game (or players may agree to have these additional forces in the mix from the beginning of the game instead).<br/><br/>The game map features northern Israel and southern Lebanon, divided into 21 large hex territories, representing three categories of terrain: Urban (a major population center, such as the cities of Tyre, Sidon and Nabatiye), Populated (full of villages and small towns, and numerous roads), and Remote (rough terrain with few inhabitants or roads.) Stacking in any hex zone is unlimited, and units move and conduct operations within these hex zones to win the game.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, they move their frog. How many spaces they move is determined by bouncing a jumping frog into the lake - a part of the board divided into four sections. The section where the jumping frog lands, determines how far the player's frog moves.<br/><br/>If the player's frog ends on a space with a water lily, the player draws as many cards as there are flowers. These cards can be action cards, which can be used right away or saved for later. Alternatively, it can be a mosquito, which is worth points.<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player reaches the end of the track. Each other player now gets one more turn, and then points are counted - the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game is also easily adaptable for solitaire play. The political boundaries shown on the map are those drawn by Hitler prior to his downfall. Victory is judged by measuring the player&rsquo;s performances against that of their historic counterparts, with the historic outcome reckoned as a draw. If the Allied player does better than Eisenhower, he will be adjudged to have won the game. If he does worse, he&rsquo;ll be reckoned to have lost the game. Each turn of play equals one or two months of &lsquo;real&rsquo; time, depending on the time of year. Each hexagon represents 40 miles (65 km) from side to opposite side.<br/><br/>World at War #60<br/><br/>",

The player who achieves a preset amount of experience wins the game. Experience is gained by summoning creatures and casting spells in battle. Battle takes place on a map that is prebuilt each time the game is played. Players must defend their lands and take over other lands with their army of creatures. Because the map can be changed every game, players have an unlimited amount of maps to play on. Six decks representing six elements (Light, Dark, Fire, Water, Earth &amp; Wind) contain the creatures and spells a player uses to defend or attack. Card combinations can be explosive or deceitful depending upon what other players hold in their hands. This game allows for exciting and varied game play. On each players turn they will perform one of five actions (Move, Play a mage, Play a card, Replenish spell book or Attack. A semi-simultaneous attack sequence allows all players to be involved during battles and possibly sway the outcome during three and four player games.  Will you fulfill the ancient prophesy for told by the mighty DragonMage Arcturius and become the next Mage to rule the DragonMage Council?<br/><br/>",

Based of the theme of the web series, players are individual workers in the company trying their best to complete projects for the company and earn rewards. Each project manager will be responsible for the success or failure of the project and it is you who decides how other players will be rewarded. This game has a couple of differences compared to the original game of I'm the Boss!.<br/><br/><br/>     Players proceed without rolling the dice and have only two options to either draw 2 cards or start a project and become the project manager.<br/>     There are no longer permanent cards in the game. Once you use them for a project they are discarded.<br/>     Added variety in types of influence cards which adds more fun ways to stall other players.<br/>     If trades(projects) do not go as planned you are required to pay a penalty. Once you fail a certain project, that project is never to be used again.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Pranks are worth -1 point at the end of the trick to the person that took them, and a trick with a prank rotates the leader of the next trick to the right of the winner.

        "description": "Warpath covers the campaign for control of Indian Territory during the American Civil War. The map covers all of the ostensibly neutral Indian Territory, plus part of the neighboring Union and Confederate states. The playing area has spaces in lieu of hexes; each space is classified according to its dominant terrain which affects movement, combat, and supply. Some of the 204 counters represent the infantry and cavalry regiments and artillery batteries used by each player to create forces on the map. Each turn represents six months of real time.<br/><br/>The action is driven by players alternately drawing campaign markers. Most markers enable the drawing player to conduct one or more operations, one operation being (1) moving and fighting with one force, (2) recruiting a unit, or (3) building a fort. Other markers allow the drawing player to control the &quot;wild&quot; Kiowa and Comanche Indians raiding from the west; they represent a danger to both sides and control switches back and forth as the control markers are drawn. The length of a turn is variable and unknown to either player; it ends after two &quot;End&quot; markers have been drawn fromt he campaign marker pool.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by control of the &quot;capital cities&quot; of the Five Civilized Tribes, but the game can end in sudden death if either player loses one of his primary bases. Each player is forced to balance active operations with force-building, concentration for offensives with dispersion to guard his territory, and careful planning with quick reaction to events.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Great Battles of Small Units<br/><br/>The system is representing military actions of small units, like a regiment or a brigade. Very frequently such  actions  in which relatively small  units  fought  on  both sides were important because of operational or moral context. Thanks to versatile rules it is possible to depict any military action from XX century.<br/><br/>Primosole Bridge is a wargame that uses the Great Battles of Small Units ruleset. Battle for Primosole Bridge was divided into two scenarios. In first, British paratroopers have to defend the bridge from the counterattacking German units. At the very beginning, staying true to problems that landing Allied units faced, players have to resolve what forces are available to Aliied side. In game there are units, that historically didn`t reach the battlefield. It is possible therefore to examine the possible outcome if air drop would have been more successful. In second scenario the British are a stronger side. Yet it doesn`t mean easy victory for them. First, they have not only to occupy the bridge but also the road leading to Catania. Germans occupy favorable terrain and their defense line is well prepared. Germans can also attempt to destroy the bridge and stop the attackers.<br/><br/>Game has tried-and-true hex and counter mechanic but with an added twist: random element is handled in this game by a deck of regular cards (which players have to supply themselves) - like combat and random events.<br/><br/>Game also has also ruleset that is relatively easy to grasp. It can therefore serve as an introduction to the board wargaming hobby<br/><br/>",

Switch off the safeties, there&rsquo;s renown to be won!&rdquo;<br/><br/>In The Paradox Initiative, players are mad scientists competing to claim strands of spacetime from worlds all across the multiverse. Who can most efficiently operate their particle-matching &quot;Paradox Engine&quot; to collect data from the different worlds? Be careful! Your collecting sends ripples throughout existence, collapsing the connections that future generations will need to reap the benefits of your reckless experiments.<br/><br/>The Paradox Initiative takes the familiar board game elements of card drafting, set collection, and resource management, then adds a Bejewelled-like grid of discs for each player to manipulate. As a result, The Paradox Initiative is simple to learn, yet challenging to master, with players navigating three interlocking systems to grab as much spacetime as they can to be hailed the greatest scientist in the universe!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blood Before Richmond is a series of games recreating some of the Seven Days Battles fought between George B. McClellan&rsquo;s Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia, under its daring new commander, Robert E. Lee. McClellan squandered a numerical advantage by demonstrating what would become a characteristic knack for turning tactical victories into strategic failures. Lee&rsquo;s ambitious battle plans were hindered by subordinates who seemed incapable of carrying them out - chief among them, oddly, the usually exemplary Stonewall Jackson. If either side had  been up to snuff, the war might have been decided in Late June 1862. Tiny Battle Publishing is proud to present this series of quick-playing, medium-complexity games about these fascinating and overlooked battles of the American Civil War, starting with Gaines's Mill.<br/><br/>Our first game in the series focuses on the only Confederate victory of the Seven Days. Despite the atypical outcome, it ticks off all the boxes on your Seven Days Bingo Card (just like the dice, it&rsquo;s not included). Lee&rsquo;s ambitious battle plan was abandoned late in the day for piecemeal frontal assaults on well-entrenched Union defensive positions. Jackson twiddled his thumbs for most of the battle, only appearing when Lee met with him personally to coordinate a final all-out assault. This managed to break the Union line, which might have held had the paranoid McClellan not held back vital reinforcements until the last possible moment.<br/><br/>A modified 2d6 die roll determines which Confederate divisions activate on a given turn. Divisions that didn't pull their weight are less likely to show up than those that did most of the fighting. It's a simple, clever, and elegant way to recreate the difficulties that Lee had during the Seven Days, and it creates the frustrating and tantalizing possibility that Jackson could do something if he'd only show up.<br/><br/>Blood Before Richmond builds on the same &quot;stacks of steps&quot; combat system introduced in Tom Russell's Blood on the Alma (2012). Flipping a counter over when you take a hit just doesn't capture the feel of bloody infantry collisions or the horrifying impact of artillery fire. This system uses step counters stacked beneath an identifying counter to account for brutal attrition and devastating wipe-outs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's spring 1927, and while Americans dance the Charleston and drink bootlegged liquor, the Mississippi Delta faces a flood of epic proportions. If battered river levees collapse, everything important to you will be washed away.<br/><br/>Rising Waters is a co-operative board game built around area control, set collection, and variable player power mechanisms in which players are members of the African American community who are confronting two powerful and arbitrary forces: nature and the racism of white landowners. Resist by drawing on hidden strengths like your family, church, music, plots of land, and education. Can you manage the rising waters to stay alive?<br/><br/>Rising Waters is played on a hex-based map of the Mississippi River and surrounding lands based on the area around Vicksburg, Mississippi. The game runs over a series of rounds representing different weeks during the flood, when players have opportunities to work cooperatively and individually to save their homes, families, and communities. During the flood, work together to keep your family and neighbors alive by minimizing losses during the flood. Players must also negotiate the arbitrary demands of white landowners.<br/><br/>Yet African Americans weren&rsquo;t solely victims in the 1927 flood&ndash;as always, they maintained a sense of agency and sources of power to survive. In the game, this comes from the Community cards, which include blues, farm animals, church, garden, family, and education cards. The cards help players upgrade their abilities during the game as well as resist racism. Rising Waters serves as a powerful illustration of the difficulty of African American lives in the Jim Crow South. Through the game, students and teachers will be able to have challenging conversations about the endemic nature of racism and how it complicates life during a crisis. If players keep below the maximum level of losses for a certain number of rounds, they've survived the worst of the flood and win the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TWRS is a strategy game for 2 players, which can be played in about twenty minutes. The game board consists of a grid of 11x11 lines. Playing takes place on the lines of intersection (like Go).<br/><br/>Each player possesses three towers (hence TWRS). Each turn you must move one of them. You can move a tower horizontally or vertically, as far as you wish. You can't jump over other playing pieces however.<br/><br/>After this, you can &quot;activate&quot; the tower you moved to place marking stones on the game board. You try to use these to lessen the freedom of movement of your opponent's towers. But they also lessen the freedom of movement of your own towers!<br/><br/>Chains of marking stones can wall off parts of the game board. Play ends when every walled off area is occupied only by towers of one player.<br/><br/>The player that possesses the largest part of the game board wins.<br/><br/>TWRS is published in a limited edition of 265 pieces. This collector's edition comprises blown glass pieces and a stainless steel box and game board.<br/><br/>",

For reasons better explained in the movie, you have been ordered to conquer the people of the planet Earth. As Supreme Commander of the Terrestrial Invasion Forces, can YOU conquer the capitals of EARTH and return to your Homeworld in VICTORY?<br/><br/>Alien: Invasion Risk (AIR) is a print-and-play solitaire game that began as a set of &quot;variant&quot; rules designed to be used with components from the board game Risk. AIR now has its own set of custom print-and-play components and fully-revised rules, transforming it from a variant to a stand-alone game.<br/><br/>Excerpt from the PDF rules:<br/><br/>Be warned &ndash; this is &quot;thematic&quot; solo gaming. Expect to plot your strategy, roll lots of dice, and ride the wave of your luck only to be ripped from the jaws of victory in the most sudden, arbitrary and unexpected way &ndash; all in furtherance of the epic unfolding story of an oddball alien race.<br/><br/>If you enjoy a game that focuses on the narrative and takes you on an interesting ride, then AIR is for you. On the other hand, if you prefer a solo game that will always reward your perfect &quot;armchair general&quot; strategy - you&rsquo;ll just have to cheat!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The object of the game is for a player or team of players to line up five chips in a row on the board to form a &quot;run&quot;. The first player or team to create two runs wins!<br/><br/>How to Play: A player begins his turn by rolling all five dice. The combination of the dice facing up is to be read like cards in a poker hand. Viable hands include full house, straight, five of a kind, four of a kind, three of a kind, two pairs and one pair.<br/><br/>A player may throw the dice once, twice or up to three times to roll the best possible combination. After their first roll, a player can roll again anything from one to five of the dice. On your second and third rolls you can again roll one to five of the dice, including re-rolling anything you had set aside in the first roll.  After the third roll place a poker chip of your team color on the board that corresponds to the poker hand combination of dice. Then the next player to the left rolls the five dice to start their turn.<br/><br/>If the squares of the board corresponding to the dice combination rolled is already covered by a chip, then that player's turn is over and they cannot play a chip on the game board. Note: there are usually two of each possible combination on the board.<br/><br/>When a player or team places five chips in a row on the board this constitutes a run. Chips in a run are protected during the remainder of the game. A player's run may share common chips with their other runs, however, a player cannot claim a new run by adding chips to the end of an established run. A new run must contain at least 4 chips not in common with the original run.<br/><br/>The first player or team to create two runs on the board wins.<br/><br/>Special Rules:<br/>The center square on the game board that can be used by all players as part of a run, but cannot be claimed by any one player.<br/><br/>Lucky 7: Anytime a player rolls a combination of the five dice so that the face value adds up to seven a player has the option to place a chip on either Luck 7 or whatever other combination appears on the dice (full house, three of a kind, etc).<br/><br/>Lucky 11: Anytime a player rolls a combination of the five dice so that the face value adds up to eleven a player has the option to place a chip on either Luck 11 or whatever other combination appears on the dice (full house, three of a kind, etc).<br/><br/>Five of a Kind: Anytime a player rolls a five of a kind that player may place their chip on ANY open square on the game board.  Wild!<br/><br/>Bouncer: After all the &quot;straight&quot; squares on the game board are filled, every time you roll another straight the results is a &quot;bouncer&quot;. A bouncer allows the player to remove any one opponents chip from game board except a chip that has been placed in an already  completed run.<br/><br/>After all the &quot;full house&quot; squares on the game board are filled, every time you roll another straight the results is a &quot;bouncer&quot;.

        "description": "&quot;World of Mythology&quot; is an unpredictable card game in which you play for the gods from ancient mythologies.<br/><br/>There is no odd stuff in the game - playing decks and special cards only!<br/><br/>There are 5 mythologies in the World of Mythology game: Greek, Egyptian, Hindu, Norse, and Slavic.<br/>There are 60 playing cards with gods, 19 special cards, and 5 player cards with gods' powers in WOM CLASSIC.<br/><br/>One game round for 4 players lasts about 15 minutes! That's why WOM is a very comfortable way to have an interactive break wherever you are!<br/><br/>Every mythology is presented by 12 gods and goddesses<br/><br/>Greek gods: Zeus (12), Poseidon (11), Hera (10), Hades (9), Ares (8), Athena (7), Hermes (6), Hephaestus (5), Artemis (4), Dionysus (3), Apollo (2), Aphrodite (1).<br/><br/>Egyptian gods: Ra (12), Geb (11), Tefnut (10), Osiris (9), Horus (8), Nephtys (7), Set (6), Anubis (5), Isis (4), Toth (3), Ptah (2), Hathor (1).<br/><br/>Hindu gods: Shiva (12), Vishnu (11), Parvati (10), Ganesha (9), Skanda (8), Kali (7), Indra (6), Surya (5), Lakshmi (4), Varuna (3), Vayu (2), Kama (1).<br/><br/>Norse gods: Odin (12), Thor (11), Frigg (10), Loki (9), Tyr (8), Hel (7), Heimdall (6), Njord (5), Skadi (4), Forseti (3), Bragi (2), Freyja (1).<br/><br/>Slavic gods: Perun (12), Dazhbog (11), Dodola (10), Veles (9), Triglav (8), Morana (7), Stribog (6), Svarog (5), Vesna (4), Hors (3), Jarilo (2), Lada (1).<br/><br/>The playing cards are simple and graphic; all detailed information can be referenced on the big player cards. After a few plays of the game, players will begin to easily recognize all the powers of gods and icons.<br/><br/>So let's start the game:<br/><br/>1. Every player gets a random player card with a mythology (a trump for that game round) and gods' powers description.<br/><br/>2. All players receive a hand of 4 random cards from the shared deck.<br/><br/>3. Dealer shows a random card from the shared deck to assign a player for the first move.<br/><br/>4. WOM is a circle card game, so every player has to play 1 card per game circle: by beating the previous card or dropping his card to the opponent's stake.<br/><br/>5. You can beat an opponent's card with a senior card from the same mythology (Zeus with his 12 points beats any Greek card) or with a god from your mythology (your trump) if his armor is strong enough (trump Hera with her 10 points beats gods from other mythologies with their 1 to 12 points).<br/><br/>6. When you play a card from your mythology (your trump), you use its special power automatically. You should read aloud the power description from your player card to all the opponents.<br/><br/>7. The winner of the hand takes all 4 cards to his stake (his earned points deck). But sometimes the winner can lose some cards from his stake due to gods' special powers.<br/><br/>8. All players take 1 card from the shared deck. The new hand begins with the previous circle winner.<br/><br/>9. The game round ends when the shared deck and playing cards end. It's time to count points from the stake. The winner of the game round becomes a dealer.<br/><br/>10. You can play either by rounds (counting just victories) or by reaching the exact point level (victory by reaching 500 points, for example).<br/><br/>Every character has a special power and an armor. Powers are based on ancient myths (Zeus beats opponents with lightning and Thor can use a thunder hammer, for example).<br/><br/>Armor level depends on god's position in adapted mythological hierarchy. There are gods and goddesses in every mythology whose power is to summon a special card.<br/><br/>There are 3 types of special cards: Wealth, Secret, and War.<br/><br/>Wealth is a card with bonus points: +10 (6 items), +20 (3 items), +30 (1 item). Available for Apollo (arts), Ptah (arts), Isis (fertility), Bragi (poetry), and Jarilo (fertility).<br/><br/>Secret is a card with a secret combination bonus: &quot;Get +5 points for each Greek card in your stake&quot;, for example. Available for Athena (wisdom), Toth (knowledge), Frigg (wisdom), and Vesna (nature).<br/><br/>War is a deck of just two cards: Death and Life. It's available for all gods of war: Ares, Horus, Skanda, Tyr, and Triglav. If you play the god of war from your mythology, your opponents have to play a risky mini-game similar to Russian Roulette.<br/><br/>We also plan for great future decks: Chinese gods, Japanese gods, gods of Mesoamerica, gods of Science, The Outsiders, and Good vs. Evil double deck.<br/><br/>",

Pick your favorite and battle it out across town as you engage in shady business, sell yourself on the streets, or off your competitors.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>Each player&rsquo;s turn is very quick and composed of two main phases: <br/>Movement (Mandatory) and Action (Optional)<br/>Movement Phase: <br/>You must move your character to any new location along the line you&rsquo;re currently on. The new location may not be occupied by another player.  <br/>Action:<br/>You may take a single action chosen from those on the new location you&rsquo;re occupying. Alternatively, you may use any action ability present on one of your call girls&rsquo; cards as long as its symbol matches the one on the currently occupied location. <br/>The effects of each action are found on the game board or on the call girl cards. <br/>After you have taken your action, and if you do not wish to play cards from your hand, you may end your turn and the player on your left will be the next active player.<br/><br/>During your turn you may play as many cards as you like from your hand, as long as their symbols match those on the currently occupied location.<br/><br/>Winning the Game:<br/>The game ends immediately when the last card from the Black Market is purchased or when the last Coin is drawn from the Coin Pool. The player with the most Coins is declared the winner. In case of a draw, the player with the most Call Girls wins - should this also result in a draw, the victory is shared amongst the winning players.<br/><br/>",

In twos, the Knights paraded into the Lists, horses draped in color tossed their heads and stamped their hooves to the jangle of golden spurs. The sun shone in splendor on shield and harness. Passing the Berfrois the ladies and damsels threw favors of scarves and sleeves to their favorite Knights. The presiding prince proclaimed the rules, and the heralds announced their champions.<br/><br/>Joust-Heroes of the Lists allows players to re-create the combat between Knights during Tournaments. Each player builds his Knight using a variety of Attributes. The goal is simple, defeat your opponents in one on one combat and gain fame, glory and yes, wealth, as you fight your way to the top, the International Tournament Circuit where all Knights are champions.<br/><br/>Joust can be played solo against non-player opponents or head to head against your friends. In fact, you can even play on the same side, making Joust the prefect game to teach your friends and family.<br/><br/>Not the traditional wargame, Joust can be played in as little as twenty minutes and is perfect for campaign games as your Knight gets better with each win.<br/><br/>Joust includes the Jousting Field and six colorful Knight cut-out counters.<br/><br/>This game is available as a PDF download and/or Print and Mail from the publisher.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Diplomacy is over. The first artillery rounds are being fired on every front of the WWI. But the frontline combats are just the last piece of an intricate puzzle. As the Commander-in-Chief of one of the 7 European powers, Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany, Austria-Hungary, Turkey and Italy, your duty is to support your nations war effort by any means possible. Improve your technology in order to make your weapons more lethal than the enemy ones, orchestrate obscure plots in the shadow using your spies and keep your home front morale high, to avoid a sudden revolution that would throw your nation in turmoil.<br/><br/>Let's war is a card game for 2 to 7 players. Each player must manage his card hand made of Conflict cards, collected from a common draw deck, and National cards drawn from his own deck. These National decks are different for each nation, making the game totally asymmetrical. To increase such an asymmetry, each player can rely on a Characters deck to pick his VIPs from. These VIPs (either generals, politicians or artists) can influence the game performance of that nation as long he or she is in charge. Conflict cards and National cards can be used to improve your own army both in defensive or offensive terms, or to activate Spies to move the war onto an undercover level. The goal of this kind of war is to reduce the Home Front value of an enemy nation, attempting to spread a revolution and destroy any civilian support.<br/><br/>The game is able to reproduce the raging early stages of the war with bloody clashes that slowly turn into trench warfare. From time to time, as some offensive power difference arise, you will see furious offensives, quickly silenced to a new stall phase.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Wikipedia ( <a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuarenta\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuarenta</a> )<br/><br/>Cuarenta is the national card game of Ecuador. It is a fishing game played with a Baraja, a pack of 40 Spanish playing cards. The game can also be played with the standard 52 card pack of Anglo-American playing cards, but all 10s, 9s and 8s are omitted (ace is low).<br/><br/>Cuarenta is Spanish for the number 40. This refers to the number of points that are required to win a chica (small division of the game) and also to the number of cards used to play it. Two chicas or the first chica with zapater&iacute;a (loss of the chica by scoring less than ten points) win the game (a completed game is called a &quot;mesa&quot;, which means &quot;match&quot;). The game can be played by 2 players, or 4 players split into two teams.<br/><br/>Five cards are dealt to each player, given out as a batch of five cards at a time. Each player plays one card face up onto the table. Cards on the table may be captured by the opponent. If cards are captured, they are placed face down in front of the player or his teammate. Played cards remain on the table until they are captured or the round ends.<br/><br/>Cards can be captured in the following three ways: matching (card same rank as on the table; player places matching card onto own pile), addition  (two cards add to the value of the other; a 2 and a 4 can be captured by a 6; an ace, a 2 and a 4 can be captured by a 7; cards with pictures have no value and cannot be captured this way), and sequence (a card captured by matching or addition entitles the picking of the next higher card; matching a 2 entitles the capturing of the 3 and 4 (etc.), as well, should there be any).<br/><br/>If a player clears the table by capturing all cards, they score a limpia. If a player captures the card just played by the player before, this is called a ca&iacute;da. In either case, the player scores 2 points.<br/><br/>Before the first individual turn after each deal, special announcements have to be made by each player if applicable. These are the doble ronda (four cards of the same rank) and the ronda (three cards of the same rank). A doble ronda  automatically wins the game; a ronda scores two points. After all five cards are played, there is a new deal. After all cards have been played (2 deals with 4 players, 4 deals with 2 players), each player or team counts their collected cards. If the number of collected cards is 20, 6 points are scored; an additional point is given for each captured card in excess of 20, rounded to the next even number.<br/><br/>A chica is won when a player or team reaches 40 points. The game is won when a player or a team wins two chicas or when the opponent doesn't reach ten points at the end of the first chica.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the official game of Silverstone. It combines both luck and skill. There are variants of the game from basic to advanced.<br/><br/>In the basic game, players are given 12 cards (each with a number on from 1-12) and they shuffle them and place them face down. Each player turns a card over in turn and moves that many spaces - there are overtaking areas and opportunities to block. The car that reaches the finish first is declared the winner.<br/><br/>The advance level allows for more skill to be involved. Each player has their 12 cards and they choose which one to play. Therefore, you can be more tactical by blocking and attempting overtaking moves. You choose the number of laps, whether pit stops should be used etc. Once all players have used their cards, the process begins again.<br/><br/>The board represents Silverstone and the cars are folded cardboard inserted into tabs. Each card has a different Silverstone fact on it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NWS: Nights of Fury - Guadalcanal Naval Battles is the first in a series of high intensity naval combat naval wargames that will offer realism and detail yet have streamlined and hard hitting game play for 2 players or solitaire play. Full color cards with highly detailed ship graphics for easy and quick recognition. Full color and detailed marker cards, random event cards, battle map, and plastic damage markers are also included. Full color island cards showing Savo, Florida, and Guadalcanal islands will also be used for the battle map. Scenario cards will include random events, weather, visibility, land effects, and other cards that will determine the setup and play of the battle. Quick result combat modifier charts will also be included to allow for fast reference to determine combat results.<br/><br/>All the critical details will be covered such as flotation and structural damage, spotting and detection, Admiral capabilities, formations, maneuvers, land effects, radar effects, armor ratings, fire controls, torpedo combat, gunnery, evasion, combat range effects, random events, crew qualities, searchlights and starshells, and more. This is not your typical generic naval card game where realism and detail are sacrificed for the sake of playability. The USN, RAN, and IJN ships each have their own researched and calculated combat factors and with the details to make combat realistic and effective. A rapid fire, efficient, and easy to learn combat system with basic, advanced, solitaire, and optional rules. No other naval combat card game has yet to incorporate the features this combat system will handle.<br/><br/>Game Info is available at: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://nws-online.proboards.com/thread/18/nights-fury\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://nws-online.proboards.com/thread/18/nights-fury</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legend of the Galactic Heroes is a wargame set in a anime universe.<br/>It is based on the most popular Japanese space opera novel &quot;The Galactic Heroes Legend&quot;, &quot;Ginga Eiyu Densetsu&quot;.<br/><br/>In the distant future, the Galactic World human is divided between two major powers: &quot;Galactic Empire&quot; and &quot;Free Planets&quot;.<br/>The Empire is under the rule of a dangerous emperor and corrupt aristocrats, while the people of the Free Planets have lost the ideals of their foundation and are under corrupt populism. Both camps have no ability to destroy the enemy or to settle the war which has dragged on for hundreds of years.<br/><br/>But the times have produced two geniuses of war into the same period. One is &quot;Reinhard von Lohengramm&quot;, the incomparable artist of war.<br/>The other is &quot;Yang Wen-li&quot;, called &quot;Miracle Yang&quot;, the magician of war. Their appearance will change the era that they live in.<br/><br/>In this game, players command Galactic Empire or Free Planets Alliance. This game contains three types of space combat ship units (BB, CL, CV) and various units which appeared in the original story. This game combines three types of starships, &quot;Battleship&quot;, &quot;Galaxy Cruiser&quot;, and &quot;Galaxy Fighter&quot;.<br/><br/>The game uses a complete original system. Players organize Fleets under the command of unique admirals by combining characteristics of Starships. Each counter in the game is an Admiral and is rated by his fighting skills.<br/><br/>You use resource points to create or buy ships and put them under your admirals. The game system is very close to &quot;Hitler's war&quot;.<br/><br/>When you fight a battle, each fleet is placed upon the combat display.  A die is rolled for initiative and the phasing side then moves their ships. The tactical map has several columns, each denoting a range bracket. Players must determine how they will do with their ships. They can move once and fire or move twice and not fire. However, ships have certain ranges that they can be used at. Battleships can be used at long ranges, cruisers at medium, while carriers can be used at short ranges.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This game came out in Old Games Journal #40.",

After using the coupons to pay the &quot;entrance fee&quot;, they begin doing a pre-determined amount of laps on the inner part of the board.  The more laps that were chosen, the more spare parts that will be needed to complete the laps.  There are also &quot;good news&quot; and &quot;bad news&quot; squares on the outer and inner board, which act as random events.  The player who completes all the laps, or makes the most number of laps, wins.

Players take it in turns to wear the &quot;Limbo-low-nose&quot; and bend over an pick up the limbo bar with their nose.  This must be achieved with only the feet in contact with the floor.  Each player has three attempts - players who cannot do this, or touch the floor with any part of their body other than their feet are eliminated.<br/><br/>Once everyone has succeeded or been eliminated the bar is lowered by removing one of the limbo blocks so that the limbo bar is now resting on four blocks.  Players now attempt at this height.<br/><br/>Play continues in this way, gradually reducing the height of the bar until either only one player is left or until at least two players have successfully picked up the bar from the floor.  If this happens all five blocks are placed under the limbo bar again, and the exercise repeated, but this time players are only allowed to stand on one foot!<br/><br/>",

This game is for 1/300 scale aircraft and uses a simple movement system which takes account of the turning and climbing abilities of the aircraft. The advantages and disadvantages of different formations and aircraft types become apparent very quickly.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This set of rules operates in three dimensions while only physically using two, height being indicated beside an aircraft. Weapon effectiveness is taken into account, and the skill of your aircrew is paramount. This is varied by nation and period to get the right feel for the game. The system also caters for game balance to ensure that no game is a walkover. There are simple rules for ammunition expenditure, Flak, Bombing, Night Actions, etc. Players can handle about 4 planes each.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The rules are quite short, but are supplemented by introductory data with over 200 selected aircraft from the main theaters of World War Two. The theaters concerned are those NOT marked with an asterisk in the list below. These illustrate the differences caused by new designs and trying to stuff more into an old design. The Second Edition incorporates a number of rules revisions and some new rules to make life even more exciting for the unwary. A whole section of Optional Rules introduces new complexities into the game, as well as also offering some emerging technologies.&quot;<br/><br/>Publisher ratings: Complexity - 4/10; Level of detail - 7/10.<br/><br/>There is a separately sold data annex, adding more aircraft: &quot;Angels 15&quot;.<br/><br/>Publisher's Home Page for the Game: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.aandagames.co.uk/scramble.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.aandagames.co.uk/scramble.htm</a><br/><br/>",

The spinner is also responsible for determining how the sand dunes are shifting and if there are some Fata Morganas on the horizon.<br/> ( Fata Morganas are caused by hot and cold air which distorts the appearance of objects on the horizon either at sea or in the desert to make them look like, well, castles in the air.)<br/><br/><br/>Additionally, there are some fixed desert fields on the board, but the main problem is, that when encountering such obstacles you need the use of water canisters. Each player has only 6 canisters and losing all of them means a restart or sometimes an elimination of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Pirelli Rallye Monte Carlo game represents a rally race with the board representing a Leg that consists of four road sections and three special stages.  The object is to be the fastest over three legs or three runs over the entire track.  In the 1980's the sport was a bit different.  Road sections were over public streets and going too fast or too slow garnered a time penalty. The Special stages were over closed public roads, private roads or trails in rural areas and speed was not restricted. In the game, the Road sections have a set number of dice throws in which a player is to travel the section with his car.  You may roll one or two D6 that have numbers 1,2 or 3 on the faces. Finishing in less rolls garners a 10 second penalty and finishing in too many rolls gets a 5 second penalty. For each special stage, a card is drawn with details of that stage and players must try and choose the best tyres for that stage, with weather conditions being a contributing factor.  Then an Unexpected Weather condition card is drawn.  The tire choice combined with info from the two cards modify the die rolls during the Special stage. The player then chooses to roll the red die that has more pips and two crash faces or the blue die with less pips and only one crash face. Along the Special stages are spaces that result in car damage if a player lands on those spaces. Prior to starting the race each player may place Repair Stations along the Road sections to repair damages incurred along the Specials stages. If a player lands on a Damage space in the first Special stage, that Damage penalty, 10 seconds, will be applied thereafter to each section until the player meets the requirement for entering one of his Repair Stations.  The player who completes the three Legs in the fastest time wins the rally/game.<br/><br/>Basically a roll and move game with a bit of flare within the theme of the sport as it was conducted at the time of the game's production.<br/><br/>This being a game for the Pirelli tire company, there is more information concerning tires in the game materials than is necessary to play the game.  The only tyres available are from Pirelli and the game materials seek to show how each tyre should be used, with the rulebook containing a lot of information about how rallies were organized and run at that time and how to choose tyres for each stage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stalingrad: The Leather Factory, 2nd ed. is a solitaire strategy game depicting the battle of Kuporosnoye, September 13-15, 1942 between the German 29th Division and the Russian 35th Guards Division at the beginning of the epic battle for the city. This area was at the southern edge of greater Stalingrad, with a large leather factory along its north side. In the game, the player (Germans) tries to capture objective hexes and headquarter locations from the Russians (played by the game system).<br/><br/>The game uses a solitaire system that reflects the historical situation but includes enough variability and uncertainty to enhance the fog of war feeling to foster replayability. The standard game is suitable for novice wargamers. There are advanced optional rules presented that contain rules that may be &ldquo;plugged in&rdquo; as desired to the standard game, to provide a more detailed and challenging game for veteran players. Designed by Gary Graber.<br/><br/>Tactical, company-level, 300 yard hexes, 100 counters, 8.5&quot;x11&quot; color map, 16-page instructions, designed specifically for solitaire play, stresses high playability and historicity.  The game puts you in command of elements of the German 29th Division, pushing towards the Volga.<br/><br/>This second edition offers newly revised rules, optional rules, and components.<br/><br/><br/>1st edition description<br/><br/>This is a solitaire design based on the early September, 1942 German assault on Kuporosnoye at the far south of Stalingrad.  The player controls the German 29th Division, and the game system handles the Russian 35th Guards Division defenders.  The game includes 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; cardstock map, set of uncut, color unit counters, and full rules.  This game is presented as a simple &quot;standard game&quot; suitable for novices, to which several advanced options can be added.  The game stresses &quot;uncertainty&quot; for the solitaire wargamer, which is provided by hidden Russian units, random reinforcements, variable &quot;daily orders&quot; from HQ, and imprecise victory conditions.

On the other side this is a nightmare for game collectors, as the box measures 20&times;14&times;2 inches.

Out of nearly 100 cards you get a random set of 5. They show the treasures you have to find and to dig out. You travel one of the numerous routes on the board depicting a world map to reach your destination as fast as possible. In order to do this there is a clever system how to use your dice roll. When you reach your destination you take 2 special dice, pay the digging fee and try your luck.<br/><br/>To enhance your treasure income, you can choose whenever you want to unearth one of the nearly 50 additional pirate treasures. But destination is hidden, and if luck is not on your side, you have to travel round the globe to reach it, and you are not allowed to skip it!<br/><br/>Game ends when the first player reaches home port after his last treasure of the initial 5 has been lifted, but winner is the one with the most income.<br/><br/>Highlight of the game are the pawns: Tiny little petroleum lanterns made of metal in 6 different colours.<br/><br/>Parts Inventory:<br/><br/>2 d6 of various sizes/types of the day<br/>2 special red lucite dice with zeros on four sides<br/>6 lantern movers large or small<br/>64 or 65 black cards<br/>30 red cards<br/>20 $500    chips<br/>30 $1,000  chips<br/>30 $5,000  chips<br/>30 $10,000 chips<br/>10 $50,000 chips<br/><br/>",

If a player is unable to legally place a number, a &quot;Sudoku Jam&quot; occurs; all tiles with that number are returned to the pile and the previous player scores a point.

But never break the whole keks into pieces! Each tile is worth one point, except the very first tile of a certain color, which counts zero points. As soon as you collect 3 same-color tiles (of value), you won that color, except for the very first color, which is won in the game.

In Lost Legacy you build a custom deck of 50 cards from a selection of character, item, counter, equipment, environment, weapon, and spell cards to challenge your opponent(s) on a modular game board.  The game incorporates elements from both CCGs and miniatures games (character cards are actually moved around the game board).  The object of the game is to acquire the most honor, honor can be acquired by destroying an opponents character during an attack, your opponent running out of cards in their deck, and having a character at certain locations on the game board.<br/><br/>Blurb from publisher's website:<br/><br/>Lost Legacy is a card game made by a small family owned company called Dreamastermind, Inc. located in Illinois.  It is a very strategic game designed to challenge players, but not their wallets.  In most card games, players must purchase multiple booster packs to acquire a couple random cards.  In Lost Legacy, players need only purchase one Expansion Set to acquire every card from that set!  This allows anyone to easily pick up on the game and build any deck they want without breaking the bank.<br/><br/>",

Owlman is an abstract strategy game with unequal forces, based on a loose theme of cryptozoological investigation.<br/><br/>The Owlman side has just one piece (a black knight) which starts in the upper left corner. Doc's side has Doc (a white king starting in the lower right corner) and 12 helpers (checkers starting near Doc).<br/><br/>Owlman's main objective is to frighten all of Doc's helpers out of the woods. Doc aims to reach the Owlman's lair (the upper left corner), along with one of his helpers (adjacent to the corner), who will help him set up his &quot;cryptozoological&quot; camera.<br/><br/>The game is played in alternating turns, moving pieces on the 8x8 board. All pieces can step to an adjacent space. Only Owlman can capture, by stepping toward a helper, who is then frightened out of the woods. Owlman also has a special &quot;swoop&quot; move (like an elongated knight's move, but 4x2 instead of 3x2).<br/><br/>",

When the island trading houses send cargo ships to the Sapphire Ports, they can only guess what the demand will be for different styles once the cargo finally arrives. So the houses send agents ahead in faster boats, on missions to promote the products the the house anticipates sending. At the same time, they try to guess what will be in demand.<br/><br/>Each of the six Decktet suits represents a different colour or style of fabric. Players use cards to influence the value of each style and collect chips representing investment in particular styles. The goal is to have invested more in the styles that are ultimately the most popular.<br/><br/>There are four separate fashion markets, represented by the four Pawn cards.<br/><br/>On your turn, you play a card to one of the four markets. The only restriction is that your card must share a suit with the previous card played to that market. The card play changes the value of that suit. After playing a card, you select one of the remaining chips and take it; each chip represents a share of that suit.<br/><br/>",

Each war galley is represented by a hexagonal counter with all important data on it, and with two sides (normal and damaged).<br/><br/>Taking turns, the players will give orders (move, board, fire or ram - this last one only available to Ottoman galleys) to their fleet and move their ships in order to win the battle. Orders are issued using Order cards, while the combat is resolved with 6-sided dice. Boardings are resolved by playing Tactical cards, attempting to outmaneuvre the opponent. When a player cannot play a Tactical card that &quot;parries&quot; his opponent card the boarding is resolved with a roll of dice.<br/><br/>The game lasts 7 turns under the basic rules, and ends when a flagship is captured or destroyed. The game comes with advanced rules for capturing ships, playing the game in 14 turns, adjusting cannon fire, and using different victory conditions.

        "description": "Congo is a game created by the Frenchman Charles Watilliaux between 1874 and 1907. This game would have fallen into oblivion were it not for another Frenchman named Michel Boutin after a public inquiry into this game in his book: &quot;Jeux de pions pour aujourd 'hui&quot; in 2001 and reintroduced by Oriol Comas in his book &quot;The World Games &quot;<br/>Congo is a very simple abstract strategy game with a board and a easy game mechanics.<br/>This game tries to emulate a site on the banks of the river Congo.<br/>4 people play and have 12 pieces each and take turns placing them anywhere on a 5x5x5 hexagonal board. The only requirement for placement is that it is not adjacent to a piece of another color, although you can play adjacent to your own color. After placing a piece, it can not be moved in any way. When a player is blocked and can not place any more pieces, they are out. The game continues until no more pieces can be played by ANY player. <br/>When a game is complete, points are then awarded. Each player gets one point for each piece not played by a player who went out before them. Thus, 3rd place gets the points for all pieces left by 4th place, while 2nd place gets points for both 3rd and 4th place's pieces. The winner gains points from all 3 who fell by the wayside.<br/>(Adjustment: If you allow ties in how many pieces are left over instead of &quot;first unable not play is first out&quot;, then both people who tie gain the points of the other person they tied with.)<br/>The best thing is to play four games, so that each player has the chance to play first. <br/>The winner is the one with the highest cumulative score after four games. <br/>When only two people play, it requires each player to use two colors, and each player must take into account that the two colors belonging to a player can not touch each other.<br/><br/><br/>El Congo es un juego creado por el frances Charles Watilliaux entre 1874 y 1907, este juego hubiese caido en el olvido a no ser por otro frances llamado Michel Boutin que luego de una investigacion publico este juego en su libro: &quot;Jeux de pions pour aujourd&acute;hui&quot; en 2001 y retomado por Oriol Comas en su libro &quot;El Mundo en juegos&quot;<br/>El Congo es un juego de estrategia abstracta muy simple pero con un tablero y una mecanica muy bella. Este juego trata de emular un sitio en la orilla del rio Congo.<br/>Jugando de a 4 personas cada jugador posee 12 fichas y las van poniendo una a una en el tablero hexagonal. La unica condicion para la colocacion es que no este adyacente a una ficha de otro color, aunque si puede estar tocando las fichas de su mismo color. Una vez colocada una ficha no se puede mover mas y no hay capturas de ningun tipo.<br/>Cuando un jugador esta bloqueado y no puede colocar mas fichas deja de jugar, cuando el tres jugadores ya no tienen colocaciones de piezas posibles se termina la partida. En ese momento se otorgan los puntos. El primer jugador que quedo bloqueado le otorga tantos puntos como el numero de fichas que no logro colocar en el tablero a los otros 3 jugadores que continuaron jugando; el segundo bloqueado hace lo mismo con los otros dos jugadores que quedaron en carrera y por ultimo el tercer bloqueado entrega puntos al ganador del partido, es decir que el ganador recibe puntos de los otros tres jugadores que han quedado por el camino.<br/>Lo mejor es jugar cuatro partidas, para que cada jugador tenga la posibilidad de jugar primero.<br/>Y ganara el que tenga el mayor puntaje total de las cuatro partidas.<br/>Para jugar de a dos personas solo se requiere que cada jugador utilice dos colores y hay que tener en cuenta por mas que los dos colores pertenezcan a un jugador igualmente no pueden tocarse entre si.",

The goal of the game is to have more stones + enclosed areas on the board than the opponent at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game follows the protocol of Symple. All placement and balancing rules of Symple apply. However, as opposed to Symple, capture is possible. A group is captured, if it has no liberties anymore. Captured stones are flipped as in Othello, meaning they change color. It is noteworthy that this kind of capture does not create liberties for the capturing group.<br/><br/>SyGo is usually played on a 19x19 square board.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mindsports.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mindsports.nl/</a> - (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>StockCar Jr. is an auto-racing game. The object is to be the first player to complete 15 laps.<br/><br/>Players qualify for racing order with a dice roll. Car movement is controlled by rolling the dice as players seek to vie for positioning in &quot;The Groove,&quot; an area of the track which allows for the fastest possible movement. But this is more than just a roll-and-move game...<br/><br/>Players can choose a car setup that's either Tight or Loose. A Tight setup is more conservative and safe, while a Loose set up gives more reward at the cost of greater risk. Players can also switch between high and low gear. Special rules cover cornering, getting &quot;out of groove&quot; and &quot;out of shape,&quot; and accidents/collisions.<br/><br/>Another interesting feature of the game is the ability to collect Power Points. Cars can gain these when they are caught in traffic or have no legal moves. They can be used later to help with tricky maneuvers.<br/><br/>All cars pit after their 4th and 9th laps. Each car gets a Pit Card which indicates how long the pit stop is how many spaces of movement it gains while exiting.<br/><br/>The game comes in rather large &quot;pizza box&quot; style container with a checkerboard patterned cover.<br/><br/>Components include:<br/>- A large gameboard with a track three spaces wide for the cars to travel on, <br/>- 2 sets of instructions,<br/>- 6 sets of control tables which represent high and low gear for the Loose and Tight car setups, <br/>- 6 sets of gauges to track Power Point usage, <br/>- A color-coordinated pair of dice and wooden playing pieces for each of the six race teams (aka players), &amp; <br/>- A set of 20 Pit Cards<br/><br/>",

Glory is obtained by raining down Iron munitions on your enemies' castle walls. This turn based strategy game allows players to experience new adventures and tactics in every campaign.<br/><br/>Iron Reign is played in a series of phases that make up each round. Kings must first manage their kingdom's Gold. Purchase an army of troops, a fleet of ships, an arsenal of cannons, kingdom specialists, and most importantly new castle walls to expand your kingdom. Move your troops and fleet into battle. Take aim and let the Iron fly; this is a key part to setting back and crippling your enemies expansion. Hopefully you purchased enough new wall segments to repair your castle and expand into new areas on the map. If you can't repair at least one of your castles your reign has ended and your enemy has claimed victory. After a tough round of battle deploy new units on the board and prepare for the next round of battle to begin.<br/><br/>Some struggles will end in a kingdom falling to an enemy while others will result in one king expanding the kingdom and taking over so much territory that victory is claimed. So many strategy combinations can be put together for victory. Eight unique kingdom specialists (occupations) can be hired to change your kingdom's strategy. These range from markets that yield extra gold to workshops that convert troops into massive land roving siege weapons. What will be your strategy, quick expansion or maybe an arsenal of cannons?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wizard's Quest is a fantasy-themed area control wargame in the 1970's. It's simple &amp; fun to play with up to 6 players. After the rise of modern euro games, I found the game has lots of potentials to be upgraded to the next level. Since the game is out of print for a long time, I decided to redesign this game in 2011. The project is named Advanced Wizard's Quest.<br/><br/>AWQ is not an expansion but an all-new game or sequel to the old game. There are new rules, tokens &amp; cards. The only thing reused in base game is the map. However, you don't need the old WQ to play this game. All the game components are available for download in the file section below. New races, monsters, unit types, treaures &amp; events are added with a new alliance &amp; treasure hunt system. However, I retained the unique random native spawning &amp; monster attacks system in the original game which is the spirit of Wizard's Quest.<br/><br/>Here is the game setting:<br/><br/>&quot;Three centuries has past since the Orcs were banished from Marnon. The old kingdom from Eric's line was splited into three clans. Each clan claimed their lords being the rightful heir to the throne.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, there are reports that natives of the island are coming back...but not just the Orcs this time. There are the Elves, the Dwarves &amp; the Lizardmen. They all came back to reclaim their homeland since ancient times. However, the greatest threat is not from the natives. There are rumors that a dark force emerged from the ruins of the abandoned castles.<br/><br/>Added to the chaos is the return of two great monsters, the Dragon &amp; the Hydra. Various monsters are also reported everywhere. People begin to believe that the protector of the island, the great wizard, Peacemaker, was dead. Yet there is a legend saying the great wizard may come back one day, but in a very different form....<br/><br/>The constant expansion of the frenzy natives finally pushed the humans back to the coasts. Seeing this as a chance, some warlords declared their independence from the old kingdom. New flags are flying over the castle in the north. This marked the end of the old kingdom &amp; the beginning of a new era - the Age of Heroes.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Besides with the Nazi panzers out of the way, what better time to trial the new assault theories while conducting an encirclement of your own ?<br/> Yelnya is designed to be an easy to learn and fast playing game for two players while still being a challenging puzzle for both sides if played solitaire<br/><br/>During each turn the Russians have an opportunity to bombard the germans before both sides move and attack. at the end of the turn both sides may receive reinforcements and a check is made to see if the german high command authorises a withdrawal.<br/><br/>Once the withdrawal order is given (usually about half way through the game), focus of play shifts from positional warfare to the germans escaping with as many units as possible<br/><br/>",

Also included are campaign game rules, designed by Alfred Leonardi and Greci, which allow for large scale tournament games.

Indeed, his losses exceeded Lee's by nearly two thirds. After escaping disaster in the Wilderness (when arguably only the wounding of Confederate General James Longstreet salvaged a stalemate from sure defeat), Grant now found himself grinding his army against the deadly abrasive of Rebel entrenchments.<br/><br/>Desperate for a clean, quick solution, Grant listened attentively to the notions of a brash 24 year old Colonel named Emory Upton. Attack on a narrow front, Upton maintained, and do not pause to fire. The condensed mass, several lines deep, would simply ram its way across the parapets. The first line, after making initial penetration would then fan left and right, widening the breach. The succeeding lines would drive straight ahead, deepening the plunge. A reserve would then arrive, to stem the sure gray counterattack.<br/><br/>Mule Shoe Salient is a regimental-level simulation of the Federal assault on May 12, 1864 at The Bloody Angle, which was the culmination of the Battle of Spotsylvania.<br/><br/>Each unit represents several companies of 120 men/strength point, or artillery sections representing 2 guns. Players alternate moving units and firing. The Federal player wins if their units occupy three or more victory hexes, while the Confederate player wins if no victory hexes are occupied by Federal troops. Any other result is a draw.<br/><br/>11x17 map, 140 die-cut counters, 12 page rulebook.<br/><br/>(source: One Small Step website and user's description)<br/><br/>",

When one is killed by another player, the killer takes a chip from the victim and flips it to the &quot;kill&quot; side.

Do you have the stamina, speed and strength to be the victor!<br/><br/>A boxing themed card game for 2 players.<br/><br/>Setup: <br/>Divide the cards into five decks: Fighters, and the four Skills decks - Punch, Dodge, Counter and Cross.<br/><br/>Shuffle the Fighter deck and give each player two Fighter cards. Players choose one card and place it face up and one card on top of it face down. Use the corner of the face down card to mark the starting stamina of 10 on the face up fighter. Note - each fighter has a unique set of skills and a favored hand.<br/><br/>Separately shuffle each of the Skill decks and deal a number of cards to each player as listed under &lsquo;Skills&rsquo; for the Fighter&rsquo;s card setting any extra cards aside.<br/><br/>Then, shuffle all Skill cards previously set aside and deal one to each player. Any remaining cards are removed from the game. <br/>Both players now have a deck of 21 Skill cards. Each player will look at their cards and choose 11 cards to take in hand for the first round. The other 10 cards will be used in the second round and are set aside.<br/><br/>Types of Skill Cards: <br/>Punch cards are attack cards and deal damage, reducing a player&rsquo;s stamina.<br/>Dodge cards are defense cards, reducing stamina damage.<br/>Counter cards are defense cards, reducing stamina damage from the other player and then immediately become attack cards and deal stamina damage to the other player.<br/>Cross cards are attack cards and deal stamina damage, and then give a bonus attack value if the next card played by the player is a Punch card.<br/><br/>Play: <br/>Players will simultaneously choose a card from their hand, placing it face down in front of them. Both players will then reveal their cards at the same time and place them face up in front of them in a row. Players then assess who will take stamina damage based on the two cards just played.<br/><br/>After 10 cards are played in the first round, both players will place their 11th card in front of them and add the number in the upper right of the card to the current stamina on their Fighter card. This is the only time stamina is added to a player&rsquo;s total.<br/><br/>Both players will then take the remaining 10 cards into their hand and fight a second round. If at any point, during any round, a player&rsquo;s stamina is reduced to zero that player is knocked out and the other player wins. The player with the higher stamina after two rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>If, after two rounds, players have the same stamina value, each player will choose 10 cards from their deck of 21 and will compete in a third and final round. If players are still tied after a third round, the match is a draw.<br/><br/>",

So gather your gear and your friends and journey across North American in your Hunt for Sasquatch. But be wary as you will have to face off against other Cryptids such as the El Chupacabra, The Wampus Cat, The Van Meter Bat Monster, and many more!<br/><br/>Each turn you will take on the role of a group of hunters<br/>and try to capture one of the location cards on the table. You will roll all the dice and match your rolls to the symbols listed on the card's victory conditions. But be careful because in these dangerous locations you always apply your dice to the Lost Conditions first and if you fill them you are defeated. If you fill neither then you can push your luck to see if you can push on to obtain victory!<br/><br/>",

Balloon features a color-friendly Cards and peaceful feelings with a sky background and lots of balloon!<br/><br/>Balloon has 2 modes of gameplay; party mode and couple mode. Party Mode is the easier and more fun mode of the game, where players need to make a balloon party merrier by adding confetti (flip Balloon Cards from clear side to confetti side) and by doing so they also sabotaging other players in a fun way. Meanwhile, in Couple Mode, players are required to use strategy to make sure they can fill their board faster or get higher Victory Points.<br/><br/>On both Party Mode and Couple Mode, winners are determined by most Victory Points, but how they acquire it is different. On Party Mode, Victory Points are distributed at random but on Couple Mode are based on how they perform on their player board.<br/><br/>There are one unique way to end the game, each time a player trade their resource to a Balloon Card, one resource has to be discarded, if there are 5 cards discarded with same color, the game immediately ends and Victory Points counted!<br/><br/>",

Then, players do multiple battles. For each battle, players play cards to the 3x3 battlefield by matching the cards' icons. If you can't play legally, or wish not to play, you have to call a 'retreat' and lose the battle.<br/><br/>If you lose the battle, you must take all the played cards in your hand, and discard down to the hand size of 6 cards. If you win the battle, you draw from the deck up to 6, unless the deck is exhausted; then you won't draw further.<br/><br/>Then start the next battle, with the previous winner placing the first card from their hand to the center of the battlefield as the lead. Continue battle until one player has got rid of their cards. That player wins the game.<br/><br/>The cards have 3 kinds of icons on the 4 sides of the card: sword / shield / flower. When playing a card, a sword icon must be matched against another sword icon. A shield must be matched to a flower, and flower against a shield.<br/><br/>Since the battle loser must draw back their played cards, players build up partial information but with discards, there are still unknowns.

What's For Dinner? is a light and fast game designed to cleanse the palate, inspire hungry players, and bring friends and family to the table. Grab meals that match your cravings and traits before other players snatch them, or you might go without.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt three dining trait cards, discards one card, keeps one hidden, and reveals the third for all players to know what their eating trait is, e.g., vegetarian.<br/><br/>The game comes with a custom food die that represents all food groups: fruit/veggie/meat/dairy/wheat as well as bacon [fats &amp; oils]. Bacon is a wild in the game, representing any of the five basic food groups as the player chooses. Each player rolls the food die during their turn to see what they crave during the round, then either acquire a matching meal card in play from the meal card pyramid of five community meal cards, or veto a specific meal card and discard that card into the dumpster (the bottom of the game box), then draw a wallet card. Wallet cards can be used during the game to purchase a corresponding meal card, better their turn, or impact another player's turn.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to get the most meal points as others decide to go along with your food choice. The game-end is triggered when the last meal card is drawn from the meal card draw pile.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Table Fighter is inspired by traditional fighting games: you are rewarded for anticipating what your opponent will do and your skill completely replaces randomness. <br/>In Table Fighter, both players have a deck of six cards that they arrange before playing, and a super card which sits face up on the table. Because each player chooses the order of their deck, there is no randomness created in shuffling.<br/><br/>Players can intentionally rearrange their decks using a &quot;betting&quot; mechanic to super-charge their moves and avoid their opponent memorizing their order, but the order of one's deck is always a direct result of their actions and combos.<br/><br/>Players select actions in their hand and then simultaneously reveal them. The winning card is chosen through a rock-paper-scissors-like mechanic. Each player starts with 20 health, last player standing wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They are:<br/><br/>     the British (government of the Cape colony).<br/>     the Natives, Bantu and older populations.<br/>     the Boers heirs of the Dutch colonizers.<br/>     the Uitlanders (literally foreigners) often technical and / or mining personnel, also discriminated like black labor men.<br/><br/><br/>Each faction uses its forces or abilities to influence areas on the map, has its own victory goal, different from the others. The British seek military victory in addition to neutralizing anti-racist demonstrations. The Natives try to turn mining workers into guerrilla warfare and try to establish communities in territories. The Boers try to enlarge their resources and exchange them with weapons. The Uitlanders promote a cultural struggle against apartheid  and act, above all, in the cities, seeking the favor of the population.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

During the Activate Phase, all Clans obtain more Battle Cards, Power Tokens and Creatures. During the Conflict Phase, Clans take turns spending a Power Token to either summon creatures, draw more Battle Cards, utilize their Avatar&rsquo;s power, or activate a found Legendary Weapon. After spending a Power Token, the Clan may then move any creatures of theirs on the gameboard, followed by an option to Battle at any contested locations. Creatures in the game have a variety of different traits that can be used in Battle, and Battle Dice, Creature Traits and Battle Cards are used in Battle to defeat the enemy!<br/><br/>In the course of the game, Clans complete Saga Cards (secret objectives) to find Lore throughout the Realm and finally a Legendary Weapon&rsquo;s location and use.

Players then take turns choosing a card and moving their ship in the indicated direction and distance, with most cards giving you choices for one or both of these values. If you finish your movement on a  treasure tile, flip it over to see whether the phantom ship moves; if it does, the phantom ship moves directly toward you, and if it reaches you before ending its movement, then you throw that treasure away instead of keeping it.<br/><br/>Some tiles have you rotate the game board (and the compass), which means that the direction cards will now have you moving in different ways.<br/><br/>After all the cards have been played, reveal seven new cards from the deck.

As time passes more letches will come to the beach, so basically... The longer you play the greater your odds of winnning... Or losing.

        "description": "Lost Worlds is the most popular entry in Alfred Leonardi's line of book games, which also includes Ace of Aces.  Each player has a character card and a booklet (and sometimes special Tactics, Luck, or Spell cards) for one of about fifty (and growing) medieval-fantasy characters.  Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/><br/>Umsplopagaas The Scorpion Wizard booklet - Tunnels and Trolls series. Comes with magic item/spell cards.<br/><br/>Character created by Ken St.Andre.<br/><br/>",

Each player is dealt 6 cards. The remaining cards are placed, face down, to create the center pile. The last person sick starts (or last round/game's loser) by playing a card face up to start that round's &quot;Viral Load.&quot; Players always draw back up to 6 cards in their hand and play passes clockwise.<br/><br/>The next player then has to beat the current Viral Load's value (or match it using Matched Play). If they can't beat it with a higher card, or are able to utilize a Power Card, then they must take that Viral Load and add it to their own Viral Load. The next round starts with the player who played the last card (except when Contagion&trade; is played).<br/><br/>Play continues in this manner until all cards in the center pile are exhausted and the game ends when the first person plays their last card. All players then count the total number of cards in their Viral Loads and in their hand (if any are remaining).<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The fifteen days that followed would make him a legend.<br/><br/>Taking as its subject Bonaparte's famous Arcole campaign, Siege of Mantua is a game of operational maneuver and tactical daring. Players move blocks on the mapsheet to threaten and deceive their opponent, with the object of bringing them to a decisive battle. These are fought on a battle display with counters drawn randomly from your unit pool. The quality of your pool improves with every victory; suffering losses will damage morale, degrading unit quality.<br/><br/>You must master both of these spheres if you wish to be victorious. Though outnumbered, the French player has the benefit of moving along interior lines, allowing greater coordination of forces. But those men are stretched thin to deal with two distinct lines of enemy advance. The Austrian player can use this to their advantage, bringing superior forces to bear at weak points in the enemy line. What results is a desperate battle of wits and nerve, and a novel take on the &quot;block game&quot; genre.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Your potential crew members, specialized gear, and game-changing events are also used as currency to pay for other cards, so you have to balance the game effect vs. the value it has in your hand.<br/><br/>Your target options are always shifting due to your rivals' actions and the passage of time in-game, so be ready for anything when your turn comes around.

The game uses a single deck of cards which consists of both the traditional playing cards (featuring a suit and rank) and goal cards (such as win a trick with a red card.)<br/><br/>This deck is shuffled and a face up market is created. Players take turns drafting cards from the market into a face up hand in front of them.  Once the drafting is complete, the players play a standard &quot;must follow&quot; trick-taking game, marking their goal cards as complete whenever they have been achieved.<br/><br/>At the end of the hand, the player with the highest sum of points from their goal cards wins.<br/><br/>",

This determines your symbol for the game.<br/>     The player with the &ldquo;double X card&rdquo; will go first and play that card. <br/>     Next, the other player lays down their single O card where it overlaps the opponent&rsquo;s card according to placement rules.<br/>     Shuffle the remaining cards and deal them equally between both players.    <br/>     Play continues back and forth until a player gets three of their symbol in a row (a win!) or all cards are played. If all cards are played, the player with the most symbols showing wins! Otherwise, it&rsquo;s a Slash (tie). Play again!<br/><br/><br/>Placement Rules:<br/>1. It must overlap one or more cards with a minimum of one space.<br/>2. It must overlap a maximum of three spaces. <br/>3. Cards must be placed vertically, but can be flipped 180&deg;.<br/><br/>",

Russia is far superior in manpower, tanks, aircraft, artillery rockets, and drones. The Ukraine has better leadership and can improve its position with help from the EU and the USA.<br/>Russia gets help from China, Iran, India and others. While the Ukraine player tries to improve the support from the West, Russia discredits western pro Ukraine politicians and conducts Cyber warfare.<br/><br/>As the Ukraine:<br/><br/>Survive the Russian Invasion, stabilize and built your army, organize International aid, gain economic and political influence, reconquer areas.<br/><br/>As the Russian Federation:<br/><br/>Try to break Ukraine resistance in an early massive assault, keep your army going and reduce losses, delay International aid for the Ukraine, discredit western politicians, undermine the enemy war effort with the help of Russian supporters in the west, gain economic and political influence.<br/><br/>Leaders have unique special abilities that can give each turn another impact. In addition they can bring bonus to certain cards and thus make card play more effective.<br/>There are leaders originating from Russia and the Ukraine. Other leaders originate from countries, that can provide help to one side or the other. For example Xi Jingpin performs as Russian leader, while Joe Biden functions as an Ukrainian leader in the game.<br/><br/>Victory is based on winning Award areas. There both players can score Victory points for a Military-, Economical- or Political Victory.<br/>The war continues after 2022, but the game can be won in one of the above patterns in 2022.<br/><br/>Yes, there will be expansions, that cover 2023 war actions.

The second, atypical, is a huge, static cathedral capable of moving things and living beings through time.<br/><br/>Lastly, the icing on the cake, the Cult of Crono can be used in Solo mode, with a system introduced in the White Death expansion with the Faun Faction, introducing new rules to represent the peculiarities of this new Faction.<br/><br/>",

As the proprietor of a struggling restaurant, the challenge is twofold: astutely manage a 50-tael debt while revitalizing the once-thriving district. Your strategic decisions in resource management, shop construction, and menu refinement will either breathe life back into these forgotten alleys or consign them to history.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>To embark on this journey, players follow a straightforward path. First, strategically acquire land deeds during the Purchase Phase, carefully balancing costs and potential profits. Next, during the Preparation Phase, optimize your menu by selecting and refining dishes to attract customers. As you enter the Serving Phase, focus on welcoming guests, earning income, and guiding them toward the diverse array of shops, each meticulously constructed with unique interior designs. The first to build eight shops, manage the debt, and accumulate 50 taels of gold will usher in a new era of prosperity, securing their place as the savior of the Song Dynasty's once-forgotten district.<br/><br/>",

Red action cards, on the other hand, may only be played during the nuclear war.<br/><br/>Cold War<br/><br/>In his turn, a player may play as many orange action cards as he wishes.<br/><br/>After that, he may program an atomic bomb if he has one in his hand. To program a nuclear bomb, the player places a target card under it and lays the bomb out in front of him.<br/><br/>Depending on the type of bomb, the selector can choose the target card from the display, draw from the draw pile, or choose from the draw pile.<br/><br/>After programming, the aggrometer must be advanced one space.<br/><br/>When the aggrometer reaches the last space, the player triggers the nuclear war with it and shifts into the role of escalator.<br/><br/>The player completes his turn by drawing 2 action cards and discarding hand cards, if necessary, so that he does not exceed the limit of 8 cards.<br/><br/>Nuclear War<br/>After triggering the nuclear war, all players, except the escalator, may program one nuclear bomb again in turn.<br/><br/>After that, each despot may play one red card per turn. The escalator begins.  He may, for example, use a defensive missile to immediately shoot down and dispose of another bomb. Or lay out a nuclear bunker in hopes of protecting it from an enemy bomb.<br/><br/>There are so many rounds until no one wants to play red cards. If you pass, you don't get to play later.<br/><br/>Big Badabumm<br/>When no one wants to play any more red cards, the big bang follows. Starting with the escalator, one target at a time is revealed under a nuke.<br/><br/>If no bunker is available, the affected despot dies and turns over his character card.<br/><br/>A bunker protects only one bomb at a time and is disposed of afterwards.<br/><br/>The nuclear bombs of despots who have already died are still launched.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last target card under a nuke is revealed. All despots who are still alive are the winners of the game.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players build up their forces in a square and assault adjacent squares in an attempt to capture them<br/><br/>Because figures simply occupy a square, there is no need for strict basing sizes.  In fact, unlike most miniatures games, there is no adverse effect for having a variety of basing sizes.<br/><br/>Note:  modifications for Russian Civil War and East Africa battles are also included.<br/><br/>Scale:<br/><br/>Infantry battalions:  4 bases<br/>Artillery battery:  1-2 bases<br/>Cavalry regiment:  4 bases<br/>Armored car squadron:  2 models<br/>Tank units:  1 model<br/>Machine gun company:  1 base<br/>Lorry transport unit:  2 models<br/>Brigade/Division HQ:  1 base<br/><br/>Squares can hold up to 12 infantry/cavalry units, artillery bases, or tank bases.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     Proletarians, To Horse!<br/><br/><br/>",

The geographic features (resource hexes) and cities mirror the approximate location of their real-world counterparts. &quot;Harbors&quot; ring the playing field.<br/><br/>The rules of the Th&uuml;ringen Edition cleave closely to those of standard Catan, with a few departures to keep things interesting. Players may only build cities in the round intersections denoting actual cities. Because some of the cities are only one hexside apart, the spacing rule requiring two roads between settlements is not in effect. Having built a road to a hex with a settlement, one cannot build a road leaving it until one has build a settlement on the hex. Finally, to obtain the benefit of a harbor, it is only necessary to lay a road on the hexside shaded in red.<br/><br/>",

Secure the finest artwork before your rival can to cement your status as a world-class art thief.<br/><br/>In The Greatest of Art Thieves, two rivals square off in a bid to secure the most valuable pair of stolen artworks. Each turn, the active player chooses one of the two pieces of artwork in their hand to drop, placing it into either the face-up Exhibition or the face-down Private Collection. Then they burgle the top card of the area they didn't choose, replacing the card they dropped. The heist ends when the Private Collection has been fully pilfered or when one thief pulls the alarm using one of a few specific cards in their hand. Each player then tallies their score based on the value in their hand, scoring extra points for nabbing a pair from the same artist.

You must weigh the various threats against you and defend the island until relief comes.<br/><br/>You are the American player in the game as it centers on Japanese attempts to capture Henderson Field by land.

After both sides realized this stalemate results of their respective positions, the English send forward their bowmen, forcing the Scots to attack.<br/><br/>Due to their poor position taken in the morning the Scots managed to attack ill-fated. When it became clear that the battle was going in favor of the English, Robert Stewart and the Earl of March fled, abandoning David II's battalion to face the enemy alone. Late in the afternoon, the king's own battalion attempted to retreat. The retreat was unsuccessful and David II was captured (though not without difficulty) while the rest of the Scottish army was pursued for more than twenty miles, resulting in more than 7,000 men casualties (by just 100 men English casualties!).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/><br/>The game consists of 10 thick wooden tiles with the front and back of each tile having one of five patterns (suits). Each tile has different patterns on the front and back, and no two tiles are alike.  Thus, each pattern appears four times.  So, for example, each of the four tiles showing the rose pattern has a different one of the remaining four patterns on the reverse side.<br/><br/>The tiles are randomly placed on the table on their sides on so that each player sees exactly one of the two patterned faces of each tile (the players sit across from each other). The first player rotates one tile 90 degrees so that it is standing up.  Next, the other player topples it either towards or away from herself (she chooses) so that one of the two patterned sides is now face up.  She then puts the tile into a pile on the side of the table so that the revealed patterned side remains face up.  After completing these steps, the players reverse roles.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to build a complete 2-D tile pyramid, with four tiles in the bottom layer, three tiles in the second layer, two tiles in the third layer and one tile on top. When building on the second or higher layers, a tile can only be placed if it matches the face up pattern of one of the tiles it is being placed on.  The pyramid can be built in any order (e.g., work on the second layer can begin before the bottom layer is completed).<br/><br/>Players may not communicate verbally or otherwise.<br/><br/>",

In the game players are collectively trying to save the world from the environmental catastrophes. Players win or lose the game collectively, but still you can count who's got the most successful country.<br/><br/>In Terra you play five rounds and every player has one turn in every round. Every player represents a country and all players together represent the international community. <br/>1. At the start of the round you remove old development tiles and turn over six new development tiles. <br/>2. Then first player starts his turn. On his turn player can do next actions as many times as he can afford in free order:<br/>-Buy one development tile.<br/>-Activate development tile with his/her worker.<br/>-Donate money to planetary fund to avoid catastrophes.<br/>-Trade with other players (one on one)<br/>-Remove catastrophe markers (with two money)<br/>After player has made as many actions as she/he wishes, it's next players turn. <br/>3. After every player has had turn, then global warming kicks in. First you remove two carbon cubes from the atmosphere and then temperature marker goes up as many places as there is carbon cubes left. (New carbon cubes emerge when you burn coal in power plants.)<br/>4. And then environmental catastrophes kick in. The temperature track tells you how many catastrophe cards you turn over. Now the chairman of the international community (i.e. starting player of this round) decides how to use planetary funds to overcome catastrophes. If he/she can't defeat catastrophes they will hit every player.<br/>5. At the end of the round every country has to feed its workers and produce needed energy. Player loses points and workers if she/he can't. And finally chairman of the international community marker goes to next player.<br/><br/>During the game you get points from some of the development tiles (cities, schools, laboratories) and at the end of the game you get points from workers, money and all your development tiles. Catastrophes make you lose money when they happen and points at the end.<br/><br/>To succeed you collectively most have more than 50 points (minimum 0, maximum 100). If the game is played in the classroom with many copies, then you can also see which group got the best overall score.<br/><br/>",

The Guilds orchestrate the movements and machinations of the nomadic colonists, necessary to securing critical resources and laying claim to a fresh region of Mars. The conductors of this activity are the Emissaries of the Guilds, freelance agents with a knack for subterfuge. As an Emissary, you are tasked with influencing the activities of colonists in a bid to fulfill a set of Guild contracts.  The first such Emissary able to complete their contracts will secure control of the region in the name of their patron Guild.<br/><br/>In Emissary: Red Planet, players will explore a grid of location cards that represent a map of a region of Mars. Players will collect and spend resources to build up influence on the location cards by establishing new settlements for colonists.  Each game will have a random set of three contract cards that determine the specific victory condition in play for that game, based on controlling certain types or arrangements of location cards.  Players will compete through managing their hand of cards, modifying the cards in the map, and positioning their influence to secure control of the landscape.<br/><br/>",

One player begins the game as the Emperor, defending the realm from Khitan raiders, providing flood relief, and collecting taxes, so as to maintain the Mandate of Heaven and continue to rule. The other players are provincial governors seeking to weaken the Emperor's grasp on power and take it for themselves.<br/><br/>What's unique about this game is that the Emperor has a completely different set of actions and a completely different turn structure than his opponents. When one of the governors is able to overthrow the Emperor, he assumes that role, while the disgraced Emperor now finds himself a governor, and must scheme to retake the throne - alongside the other players.<br/><br/>Actions taken by the players include military expansion, army building, the collection of taxes, and the purchase or play of event cards.<br/><br/>&quot;May you live in interesting times&quot; is sometimes inaccurately attributed to an ancient Chinese curse, but regardless of where the phrase comes from, these are interesting times indeed. Petty warlords, rebellions, and natural disasters enter play via event cards, and create the chaotic tapestry upon which your struggles for power are woven. Not only must you deal with one darn thing after another, but you must work to turn them to your advantage. Every action you take has its cost, and creates opportunities for the other players.<br/><br/>Throughout the game and at the end, players will score Victory Points for their accomplishments - and earning a VP every turn is the Emperor, because staying in power for any length of time in the Five Dynasties era is an accomplishment! - and the player with the most Victory Points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crown of Arag&oacute;n is a card-based area control game set in the vast medieval kingdoms that controlled the western Mediterranean Sea, stretching from northern Spain all the way to southern Italy. As the monarch of one of these smaller kingdoms, you will seek to prove your worth as a ruler and bring unity to the larger region by claiming the vacant Crown.<br/><br/>The game is played using a shared draw deck of 54 cards. On a player's turn they play one or more cards into one of three areas of influence; Economic, Military, or Political. Then players compare the total strength of their cards in each area to determine who if anyone will gain influence in those areas this turn. A player wins when they have 10 influence in a single area (or 5 influence in two areas) at the end of their opponent's influence phase.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Pratzen: Austerlitz, 1805 is a two-player Tactical level board-wargame that portrays the fighting on and around the Pratzen Heights at the Battle of Austerlitz. The battle was fought between the French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte and a larger allied army composed of Austrian and Russian forces. The battle is considered to be one of the most important and decisive engagements of the Napoleonic Wars. The engagement result brought the War of the Third Coalition to an end and about the Treaty of Pressburg. The battle is widely thought of as a tactical masterpiece on par with Cannae.<br/><br/>The game is designed by industry veteran and author of The Art of Wargaming, Peter P. Perla. The game system of The Pratzen: Austerlitz, 1805 began some three decades ago as an idea to update the classic SPI Tactical wargame Grenadier, published in 1971. Pratzen evolved into a merger of the Grenadier scale with some different combat mechanics based on the original von Reisswitz Kriegsspiel rules of 1824, adopted as a training tool in the Prussian army after the Napoleonic Wars. The scale was shifted from half-battalions to companies and divisions as the basic infantry maneuver piece, and much additional streamlining and simplification ensued.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Communist forces hoped a popular uprising by the &ldquo;oppressed&rdquo; people in South Vietnam would lead to a general uprising and overthrow of the &ldquo;puppet&rdquo; regime supported by the United States. The city of Hue was the only city to be completely occupied by the communist forces during the massive offensive, and was the scene of violent and close-quarter fighting that waged for nearly a month, from January 31st to February 25th, 1968. The general uprising never occurred, and in fact the communist&rsquo;s disappointment led to atrocities when they massacred hundreds of &ldquo;collaborators&rdquo; after they took control. The fighting to retake control of the city and oust the NVA and VC devastated the city and Imperial Palace, symbolizing the tragic and confused nature of the war.<br/><br/>Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side&rsquo;s forces.  Both players will have capabilities to inflict harm upon their opponent, while also having liabilities to protect.  Contestants will be challenged to do as well, or better than, their historical counterparts. Players use a standard deck of playing cards, one deck for each side, to activate units and resolve some combats. Play is very interactive yet also solitaire friendly.<br/><br/>The map scale is about 100-150 yards per inch. Each combat unit represents a platoon (25 to 30 men, 2 tanks or 6 APCs (Armored Personnel Carriers) and artillery batteries (M-109, Katyusha rockets, and mortars). A game turn represents 2 or 3 days of time.<br/><br/>",

An undefended attack will lead to the destruction of one guardian and if there are none left, a direct attack dethrones the opponent god, spelling defeat for that opponent.<br/><br/>AWE is set in a historically not at all accurate prehistory, where four advanced, lost civilizations - Atlantis, Hyperborea, Lemuria and Mu - vie for ultimate domination. The game will feature awesome and fantastic untis you can send into battle such as Raptor and Pterodactyl Riders, Zombie T-Rex's reanimated by black magic, advanced Vimana aircraft, War Mammoths and much more, as well as a pleasant mix of unique and exciting mechanics.<br/><br/>This game is a collaboration between talented Indonesian artist Widodo Pangarso and Austrian Game Designer Andreas Propst.<br/><br/>",

Once everyone has finished picking up cards, check all the cards collected to see whether anyone made a mistake; if so, that player must return the mistaken card and one correctly collected card.<br/><br/>Players repeat this process six more times, first laying out three more cards from the deck each time, then they see who has collected the most cards and won!<br/><br/>Manimals: Serengeti-Park Hodenhagen includes rule variants that allow for play with children as young as four.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns peaking at the cards to determine where the most cows are hiding, deviously moving the cows around, and strategically placing their tractor beam cards along their 2 sides of the pasture. Once all the tractor beams are in place, players compare the power value of the beams that intersect on each cow. The player with the higher total power value pulls that cow into their ship.

In the game there are two types of cards: Bug Cards (showing 1 of 6 different bugs), and Bug Off Cards (Showing a particular net color). Every player begins the game with 3 randomly dealt Bug Cards.<br/> During a players&rsquo; turn, the player draws a card and plays a card. To play a card, each player has the option to play a Bug Card face up to the table or use a Bug Card to collect matching face up bugs for all players. If a Bug Off Card is drawn during this turn, it is played as an interrupt. In this case, all bugs that match the color of the net are instantly removed from play and can never be added to any collection.<br/><br/>Players earn points for every bug they collect. The player with the biggest bunch of bugs after all the cards are played is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A rather straightforward dice game by Sid Sackson. Players alternate rolling two dice and allocating markers onto a 5 x 5 grid at the coordinates corresponding to the numbers thrown. If a six comes up, it can be counted as any other number by sacrificing six points from the acting player's score, or else simply re-rolled. Players are allowed to choose in which order the coordinates are read off the dice, so that each roll (other than doubles) gives two possible placements. If an occupied grid point is selected, points are scored according to the number of adjacent grid points contiguously occupied by stones of the owning player. The game is won by the player first player to reach a pre-determined total score. (The rules suggest 177, but this can lead to extremely long games...)<br/><br/>The game was originally published by Gamescience/Renwal. It was re-released by Das Spiel as Saxum, with some significant rules changes.<br/><br/>",

Random events such as the Dreyfus Affair, the Boer War, the Berlin-Baghdad Railway, the Russo-Japanese War and the Black Hand add to the tensions.

It has been designed, and play tested to a virtual fare-thee-well, to bring about 2 to 3 hours of continual fun for the players.  All players are involved in every player's turn, so there is no &quot;down time.&quot; In essence, while one player is robbing a bank, the others become the Law Enforcement aspect of the game, trying to stop him with roadblocks, tear gas, gun molls, tommy guns, and whatever else they can throw in his path.<br/><br/>If the Bad Guy (there are 20 historical &quot;Bad Guys&quot; from Dillinger, to Jelly Nash, Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, the incredible Barkers, the inept Kelly's, and the truly creepy Alvin Karpis, all rated for a variety of capabilities) succeeds he not only pockets the take, but he gains Notoriety. And accumulating Notoriety is what the players are doing to win. Obviously a successful kidnapping (a rare event) will bring loads of Points, but convicting another Bad Guy with your in-house mouthpiece (again, real-life lawyers, from the great trial attorney, Sam Leibowitz to the down-and-dirty Louis Piquett) can also get you some Notoriety. Opportunities to amass points are ubiquitous, and winning games usually comes right down to the end.<br/><br/>Each game of DILLINGER includes 1 Rules Folder, 1 Background information Folder, 110 Player Cards, 5 Location Mats, lots of Funny Money, and one small sheet of Mike Lemick colorful cut-and-paste counters.<br/><br/>",

Each player runs a team of 4, 5 or 6 racers, teamwork between the racers helps to improve the position of the team's racers through slip-streaming. <br/>There are four short stages and 2 long (mountain) stages to the full race, but a lesser number could be raced over. There are 34 (green) random movement (&amp; event) cards: nine '1's, 13 '2's , nine '3's and one '4', a hunger/fall card and a weakness/blackout card. Each player also holds a pack of 9 yellow cards. one '+5', one '+3' one '+2' three '+1's, a spare wheel, a food musette (musette = In cycling, a bag containing food handed out in a feed zone of a multi-stage race such as the Tour de France) , and a 'Baraka'. (which means good luck in French slang.) On their turn the active player draws a random card for each of their racers, and if desired adds one of their yellow cards. Yellow cards are discarded for the stage after play. <br/>If a racer ends his move with one space between him and the player of his team ahead of him, then he can slip-stream into the space provided it is not filled by racers of other teams. A racer can also slipstream another team's racer if there is a completely empty road space between them. Roads are 4, 3 or two riders wide, depending upon the terrain.<br/>The winner can be decided by shortest number of turns taken to complete the course, or by placing in the finishing order of each stage - (better to agree this in advance). The short stages can take between 30 and 60 minutes, and the long stages 60 to 90. A lot depends upon the number of players, and of racers per team. If the whole race is to be run is would be best to spell it over a weekend with some other games filling between stages.<br/><br/>",

The benefit of playing this game was that it was less costly than it's bigger named brothers and sisters in the genre.

It features every player that had 30 at bats or 10 innings pitched, so as far as having completeness of each team, the game excelled.<br/><br/>But having to roll the dice to check if the batter was HBP, or walked then roll the dice again to see is there was a hit, then again to see if it was a single , double, triple or home run, then roll the dice to see what field the ball went to, which fielder caught it, whether or not the fielder committed an error, roll the die to see if the pitcher holds the runner, roll the die to see if the 2nd baseman was able to turn the double play, roll the dice.......well you get the idea. The designer states &quot;....There are some plays which require a lot of die rolls, but as you play the game you will realize an increase of play time and these extra rolls make the game realistic.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cubulus / Die-Check is similar to chess on a 9x9 board except that for pieces each player has eight strategic cubes (dice), two shields (unmarked pieces the size of two cubes) and a master (king).  The game ends with a checkmate.<br/><br/>The strategic cubes move the number of squares shown on their top face, and each step of the move rolls the die to its adjacent face (thus the new top side is determined be the sequence of horizontal and vertical steps).  Shields move so that one of their two covered squares stays the same.  The master moves one spot orthogonally.  (Additional moves for shields and strategic cubes exist in the advanced version.)<br/><br/>Captures are made by moving onto other pieces, except that shields require one half to be put in check and the other half to be moved onto.  If the master moves to the far end of the board it can be returned to its original position and replaced with a captured piece.<br/><br/>",

Theater of War is designed to be used with miniature collections of existing, fixed sizes (no more collecting and painting forces for the next game just in order to meet the order of battle requirements!) while providing an entertaining background for a campaign with a definitive conclusion. Theater of War provides a system for determining tactical scenarios, based on decisions made by the campaign players. Theater of War includes rules for organizing campaigns in all of the periods covered by the Piquet rule system.<br/><br/>Theater of War vividly represents the fog and friction of war, modeled by sequence decks and initiative rolls. Battle Hands made up of Sequence cards are used to move from the campaign map to the tabletop. Battle hands determine what type of tabletop battle will be fought, as well as any particular advantages (relative army sizes, terrain, set-up) that will exist.  This combination and interplay of Battle Hands is the heart and soul of Theatre of War.  It allows a campaign to be fought without an umpire making rulings about force strengths and scenario definition, as well as providing for pre-battle maneuvering as both sides attempt to gain an advantage. Theatre of War places the gamer in the predicament of not knowing for sure what the tabletop game will hold - that is, not knowing until they've committed and played their cards!<br/><br/>Theatre of War is designed to provide a campaign framework for Piquet tabletop miniature games.  In order to play Theatre of War, both the Piquet master rules and the period supplement in which the campaign is set are required.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Piquet: Master Rules for Wargaming<br/><br/><br/>",

Actual principles of war apply... A real mental exercise... An excellent gift for the 'Chess and Checkers' type&quot;<br/><br/>Tactics is a landmark game in that it was the first cardboard-counter commercial board wargame that was intended (albeit with limited success) to accurately simulate warfare and command.<br/><br/>The game was self-published by Maryland National Guard infantryman Charles S. Roberts, who would go on to found of Avalon Hill Games. The original edition of Tactics was published by the Avalon Game company, with a print run of approximately 2000. Roberts sold Tactics by mail order out of a garage in Avalon, Maryland.<br/><br/>The game portrayed a modern day strategic conflict between the forces of two hypothetical countries. The opposing units included infantry, armor, and airborne forces. The game was played on a mapboard which used a square grid rather than the hex-based style map which would later became preferred in the board wargaming industry. However, many of the conventions and mechanics established in Tactics still live on, in one form or another, in many of the wargames published today.<br/><br/>Based on his success with Tactics, Roberts decided to expand his operation and in 1958 he formed Avalon Hill Games. The initial line-up of games from Avalon Hill included Tactics II, a revised version of Roberts' original wargame. Avalon Hill would go on to publish a 25th Anniversary edition of Tactics in 1983, which represented a modified version of the original game in that it used a prototype mapboard which had not previously been released.<br/><br/>Other than a few graphical changes there are some functional changes from the Tactics map to the Tactics II map:<br/><br/>Going over the 1954 Tactics and 1958 Tactics II boards square by square the only functional changes are:<br/> - The squares around the edge of the map for 1958 now have numbers 1 to 43 from North to South and 1 to 55 West to East.<br/> - Cities for 1958 had unique numbers added. <br/>No numbers are present on the 1954 board in the cities or the grid.<br/> - There is no map compass on the mapboard label like there is in Tactics II<br/> - The mountain pass in the large mountain range on the board label edge is not present on the 1954 map. Also there is only one single clear square, same place as in Tactics II, 7 squares in from the Blue coastal city near the map label in that mountain range. There are none of those longer dead end corridors in the big mountain range like on the Tactics II map.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Tactics II<br/>    Tactics (25th Anniversary Edition) (25th Anniversary Edition)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Tell your own stories of crime in the big city.&quot; A card game inspired by the film Noir genre.<br/><br/>The players share a common custom deck of cards that contains six suits: Atmosphere, Locations, Help, Hindrances, Witnesses,  and Clues. Each card is named after something reminiscent of the elements of film Noir movies from the forties and fifties. There are twenty cards in each suit for a total of 120 cards in the deck.<br/><br/>The rules call for &quot;the meanest player&quot; to start the game. The players seek to play six card combos (a &quot;storyline&quot;) containing one card from each suit in the deck. The game ends when the deck has been exhausted. The player who played the most combos wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In Untamed: A Rummy Revolution , you will compete to try to get the most animals into your own field--and it never hurts to have the winning animals on your side!<br/><br/>Based on the familiar card game, Rummy, Untamed: A Rummy Revolution adds more player interaction and strategy through action cards and the concept of ranking melds. Each card has three characteristics. The more characteristics the cards in a meld share, the higher the meld is ranked. By playing higher-ranked melds, you are better able to attack your opponent's animals, herd animals into your own melds, and defend against your opponent's attacks. Watch out for the King of Beasts cards, though! If you can meld a set of three of them, you can prevent your opponent from scoring, but if they're left in your hand at the end of the round, they'll cost you.<br/><br/>",

One location card is placed on the direction board, which has arrows pointing north, south, east and west.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws a location card &ndash; keeping the latitude and longitude on the back of the card secret from all players &ndash; then places the card next to the direction board, indicating how she thinks this location relates to the starting one. Is 'Nippes' west or east of Bonn? Why sure, so place it by the west arrow. Location cards can be placed between cards already on the board.<br/><br/>After each location card is placed, any player can challenge the positioning of that card. That player reveals the back of the most recently placed card as well as one adjacent card. If the challenge was correct &ndash; and the card placed wrongly &ndash; the challenger wins a point chip from the placer and the card is removed; otherwise the challenger hands over a chip to that person.<br/><br/>After 15 cards are placed, the interlude card signals an interim scoring in which all players secretly guess how many cards have been placed correctly. Guess correctly, and you score two chips; if no one is spot on, the closest guesser wins a chip.<br/><br/>After three rounds and the final interlude scoring, the player with the most chips wins.<br/><br/>",

Historical clues have led your archaeological team to the general area where they existed, but now you must find the exact location of their sacred sites and buildings. You're not the only one looking however so you'll need to hurry if you want to claim the discovery for yourself.<br/><br/>In this solo roll and write game, you'll enter numbers into the search areas for four lost sacred sites/buildings. You're goal is to match the total for each row and column to a target number. The better that you're able to do this, the quicker your team can locate the site and the higher you'll score. Take too long and a rival archaeological team will find it first and you'll get no points.<br/><br/>As you search for the first three sacred sites: the Altar of Offerings, the Observatory, and the Grand Temple, you'll find clues leading you to the general location of a fourth huge site known as the Tomb of Kings. You'll use those clues to unlock that location and then search for it as well. The Tomb of Kings has the potential to earn you the most points, but is also the most difficult.<br/><br/>",

This battle primarily involved the Australian 9th Infantry Division, as well as British artillery batteries that were tasked to prevent the capture of Tobruk harbor by the German 5th Light Division. Each game turn represents approximately six hours. Game turns are not divided into separate friendly and enemy turns, but rather they are comprised of numerous individual headquarters activations.

        "description": "Cube Hog is a 2-4 player family/party style card game all about using strategy, luck, and even slight of hand to &quot;hog&quot; more cubes than your opponents!<br/><br/>Gameplay: Learning to play Cube Hog takes only a couple minutes. Each player is assigned a color (Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) and given their color player cubes, 5 to each player. Cubes are all pink except the underside which has a hidden player color. Each color is given a value card facedown to dictate what each color cube is worth.<br/><br/>For example: If the blue player has a 1 on their value card, then the cubes that have blue on their hidden underside are each only worth 1.<br/><br/>Players take turns playing action cards to best their opposition. Action cards are used to steal, swap, and flip cubes over to reveal the underside. Action cards also can be used to look at other players value cards, flip over value cards for everyone to see, or even to change a value card. The player with the highest value of cubes at the end of the round wins the game!<br/><br/>Cube Hog can be played in two ways. Quickplay is the fastest way to pick up and play. Quickplay games last about 10 minutes and a great for some quick fun. Competitive play consists of multiple games of Cube Hog with each game won rewards the player with a Gold Cube. Playing this takes about 45 minutes. This also adds the 'Gold Cube' card into the deck to add a new mechanic specifically designed for competitive play. First player to win 3 gold cubes wins the competitive play game!<br/><br/>Cube Hog rewards players who can remember which cube is which while the cubes slowly get shuffled around the table. However, players are also rewarded when they use sleight of hand to shuffle their own cubes to fool other players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tucked away in the corner of the tribe&rsquo;s archives, a dusty tome has been discovered. In it, scholars have come across what had only been legend: a new method of harnessing the power of the glyphs. Why had this tome been hidden away? Unfortunately, the scholars learned the answer to their question much too late, and cursed they ever found the tome&hellip;<br/><br/>The Glyph of Destruction is a new glyph in the land of Tundrus. This glyph, as the name suggests, is not to be trifled with. The new method of harnessing the glyphs has remarkable power: Players are able to generate doubles of any glyph they desire with ease. But such power comes at a cost. In rare instances, the method doesn&rsquo;t generate the desired glyph, but instead forms an entirely new glyph. A glyph that eradicates the power the player once had.<br/><br/>During a champion&rsquo;s REPLENISH phase, players may elect to temporarily substitute active dice for one or more of five black dice. Each of these dice specialize in one of the five other glyphs. Four of the sides have a double-glyph of the die&rsquo;s specialization. Be warned, however, for the other two sides have the Destruction Glyph. Any time the Destruction Glyph is rolled, the die is immediately locked in (can&rsquo;t be rerolled), and the original die that was substituted for the black die is trashed. Once the black die has performed its function that activation, it is returned to the general stock and players regain the die that was substituted (assuming it wasn&rsquo;t destroyed).<br/><br/>",

What's more, those newly purchased cards go straight into your hand and can be used immediately, and any unused cards can be retained in your hand ready for use on your next turn if you're building towards something!<br/><br/>With numerous &lsquo;on the fly&rsquo; upgrades available, and a decision-tree that multiplies very quickly, ALIENS ATE MY PLANET! rapidly gets you into that all-important mid-game space, giving players a lot of choice and multiple options every turn, transforming it into a razor sharp balancing act: players are knee-deep into the &lsquo;meat and potatoes&rsquo; of the game within a very short space of time, and it won't outstay its welcome at approx. 45-60 mins.<br/><br/>The game has been designed to carefully balance both the decision-making process and the constant desire to streamline your deck, thus placing players into that classic decision-space of having half a dozen possibilities and a wealth of options available each turn, all of which are positive choices!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Solitaire Print and Play Fishing Dice Game!<br/><br/>In this solitaire fishing dice game You roll 3 six-sided dice. You catch a fish when you roll doubles and one different number, that different number is the kind of fish you catch.<br/><br/>You must always catch the small fish of a kind first, then you may catch the big one. You can never catch the big one first if the small one is still available! once you catch both of a kind those are no longer available.<br/><br/>Small fish are worth 1 point, big fish are worth 2 points!<br/><br/>If you roll trips of any kind you can catch any fish you want respecting the small to big fish catching rule. In other words, when choosing which fish to catch after rolling trips, if a small one of that kind is available you must catch the small one, but if the small one has already been caught, you can go ahead and take the big one!<br/><br/>You can always use a &quot;Lucky Nudges&quot; box to change the number of one die, but only by one unit, either up or down. As an example you can change a number 2 roll to a 1 or a 3 by marking one of the &quot;Lucky Nudges&quot; boxes. Use the lucky nudges carefully, you don't get more than the available four per game! Once they're gone, they're gone!<br/><br/>If you roll 1 2 3 the game ends immediately! The game also ends with a 4 5 6 roll or by rolling three &quot;Awful Casts!&quot; An Awful Cast roll is a &quot;nothing&quot; roll! Like a 1 4 6 or 3 4 5 for example (if you happen to &quot;catch&quot; a fish that's already been caught, nothing happens, roll again, this is not considered a &quot;nothing&quot; roll). So When you roll an &quot;Awful Cast&quot; mark one of the appropriate boxes. If all three get marked the game ends. BUT! with the 4 5 6 roll and the Awful Casts you may use one of your Lucky Nudges to keep going AND maybe even catch a fish in the process! As long as lucky Nudges are still available of course.<br/><br/>Keep rolling until you either catch all the fish or run out of luck! Happy Fishing!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Doozy Dice is a quick dice rolling game where players use 5 dice to match unique &ldquo;doozy&rdquo; combinations. At the start of the game, the 26 doozy cards are shuffled and 5 are dealt in the center of the table. These are the 5 doozy combinations each player will need to complete during this game. Players take turns rolling the dice and making combinations in as few rolls as possible. Two of the dice come with a doozy face on one side. These are either needed to complete a combination or act as a wild.<br/><br/>Players also collect doozy dots along the way either when anyone rolls a doozy face, or by completing combinations in 3 or fewer rolls. Use Doozy dots to change a roll and complete a combination. Any remaining doozy dots are subtracted from your roll total at the end of the game. The player who completes the 5 &ldquo;doozy&rdquo; combinations in the fewest number of rolls wins.<br/><br/>During Doozy Dice, the third roll is a key decision point for each player. If you complete a combination in 1-3 rolls, you get a bonus, 1 doozy dot, while all their opponents lose a doozy dot. Players need to decide: &ldquo;Do I use the doozy dots I have to get this combination in 3 rolls, or save them for later?&rdquo; To keep the game moving right along, there is a 13 roll limit. If a player rolls to 13, they note 13 rolls for that combination, and lose a doozy dot.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It also brings Buster into the multiplayer game, where he moves from Site to Site, making it risky to go to the same place as him with your Pioneer&mdash;unless, of course, you want to Bust&hellip;<br/><br/>The expansion features all of these and more!<br/><br/>&mdash;Description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player shuffles his own 16 tiles and places them face down, then white draws his top tile and places it, with the piece oriented so it looks upright to him. Black then draws the top tile in his pile and places it so that it touches white's piece, either orthogonally or diagonally, and oriented so that it looks upright to him.<br/><br/>At that point, white can either add another piece or move his piece on the board. A move must be a legal chess move and may not separate any element of the board; all pieces much remain touching, even if just diagonally, when a move has ended. Thus you can &quot;pin&quot; a piece by placing a new piece on the far corner of a piece already in play.<br/><br/>The game ends in checkmate or stalemate, with a stalemate occurring when you must place your king into check when you draw it.<br/><br/>Chex was originally published in 1982 by IQ Products as Chess Cards. The rules in that version differ significantly from those in the later self-published version.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Кубическая рыбалка (&quot;Dice Fishing&quot;) is a fast-paced and exciting dice-rolling game that feels a lot like real fishing! <br/>Each round, the players take turns rolling 6 custom Bait dice.<br/>There is a common row of Fish cards that is replenished after each player&rsquo;s turn. Each card requires a certain set of bait to be placed on it. If all slots of the card are filled, the fish starts biting! The players can guess which of the 7 fish types they are about to catch &mdash; zander, trout, perch, pike, sturgeon, salmon, or ide &mdash; but they won&rsquo;t know for sure until they flip the card and see it! <br/>The larger the fish, the harder it is to catch it. Moreover, every fish might get away! In order to increase your chances, you will be mastering your fishing skills by resolving different Opportunity cards that will allow manipulating your rolls and the assortment of fish.<br/>During the game, the players score additional Achievement tokens for different sets of their fish and as soon as anyone collects 7 different fish, they score the endgame Achievement token. After the final scoring, whoever has the most VP wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It not only provides continual laughs and non-stop &quot;smack talk&quot;, but it also allows players to freely flow in and out as they wish without interrupting the game.  This flexibility, mixed with a uniquely interactive game play, make Don&rsquo;t Be a Loser an absolute hit among the fun-loving party crowd.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the Biggest Winner, but more importantly, to not be the Biggest Loser.  n order to advance down the board players compete in a wide variety of one-on-one challenges including physical challenges, Mathlete questions, Super Sleuth puzzles, acting challenges, creativity challenges and much more.  Other players are able to bet on which player they think will win, keeping everyone involved as much as they wish to be and making the competition to not be a Loser fierce.<br/><br/>The exciting twist: before starting the game players all decide on the penalty the Biggest Loser will pay.  It could be as simple as having to sing a silly song or to buy the next round of beverages, to more serious stakes such as the Biggest Loser having to wash the Biggest Winner&rsquo;s car.  Needless to say, you don&rsquo;t want to be a loser!<br/><br/>",

The player chooses his crew, allocates points representing pilot/crew abilities, and, having assessed his strengths and weaknesses, chooses his flight path to the target. Tables and tracks printed on the map sheet provide quick access to information needed and action outcomes. Random events are revealed during flight as are encounters with Luftwaffe and Flak. The player is called upon to make life and death decisions every step of the way, in short, managing mayhem. Nothing in the game is scripted. Most missions play in five to 15 minutes. It is as close as you can get to flying over the Ruhr in a Wellington without climbing into a cockpit.<br/><br/>Published in Paper Wars #79.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You've never seen a stacking game with charm like this! Filled with chunky wooden charms featuring the joys of Tokyo, this stacking game challenges players to build two wobbly towers at the same time. Choosing which piece to place next is critical as it may leave your opponent with some of the hardest (and heaviest) pieces for the top of the stack.<br/><br/>In addition to two unique modes of play, you may enjoy keeping these charms as decorations in between games.<br/><br/>Goal of the Game:<br/>Players gradually stack wooden figures with Japanese motifs onto the two &quot;Little Tokyo&quot; Skyline base pieces. If any piece falls or if one of the tower collapses, the player that caused the fall loses a point. The game ends when all pieces have been stacked OR someone has collected three negative points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Gather the ingredient elements within the time limit, throw them into a magical pot, and create the minions written in the recipes. The one who has created many and powerful minions wins the competition!<br/><br/>The Minion Recipes takes place over five rounds, and in each round players draft both element cards and pot cards. When a player has a pot and the necessary elements to complete one of the recipes on display, they can stop the round in order to create the minion, possibly taking advantage of its special ability at the same time. Players can drop out of the round in the middle of a draft, throwing away the remaining cards instead of passing them, but they forfeit the ability to create a minion. Players can carry over three cards into the next round, giving them a head start toward a recipe, but everyone can see which recipes are available, so you'll still be racing to complete something before anyone else.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "publisher's description<br/><br/>Battleground, North Africa, 26 May, 1941 - The recent Allied attack to relieve the Tobruk garrison, &quot;Operation Brevity,&quot; had been largely a failure. However, it left them in possession of the strategically important Halfaya Pass, the gateway to Egypt. In addition, British forces were harassing the German defenders with mobile columns to the South. German General Rommel recognized the need to recapture this terrain in order to stabilize the front. Still fearing the British infantry tank, Matilda, an under gunned, ponderous, mobile fortification, Rommel launched three panzer battalions plus supporting units to sweep the British from the field. The offensive was code named, &quot;Unternehmen Skorpion,&quot; ultimately known to the Allies as Operation Skorpion. The battle was brief and violent. Although there was a significant disparity in firepower, the Germans had a definite Achilles heel. Can the Germans accomplish their goals of capturing the Halfaya Pass and clearing its southern approaches before their supplies are exhausted, particularly the remainder of their fuel allotment?<br/><br/>Operation Skorpion is a relatively short, fast moving game that introduces a new fog of war game system. Opposing strength is unknown until units enter combat. Once revealed, those combat values can continue to fluctuate during the course of the game based on judicious use of mobile supply units, which can distribute and absorb Allocation Points. Although fighting a defensive battle, the British Player is not without counterattack capability. He will find his artillery arm, both direct and indirect fire, to be a potent force. Game rules such as: Combined Arms, HQ Coordinated Combat, Road Overrun, Engineers, and Reconnaissance Probe, all contribute to an appropriate sense of realism. Operation Skorpion provides exciting, tense, and balanced game play. Determining the ultimate winner often occurs on the last or next-to-the last game-turn. Turn back the clock to the heady days of Spring 1941 and command the Afrika Korps, or take on the British and ultimately break the sword of the Desert Fox, himself, in this battle game by Compass Games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thai Checkers is a traditional game from the checkers family played in Thailand. <br/>Its rules are often given wrongly, including online gaming sites.<br/><br/>Thai Checkers is played on an 8x8 board. The board is set up so that the lower left corner is black. Each player has 8 men (ordinary Checkers) which are placed on the black squares of the first two rows. Black starts moving. Only one piece may be moved at a turn. Pieces consist of men and kings.<br/><br/>Men move and capture as in English Draughts or American Checkers. That means they move and capture diagonally forwards and forwards only. At the end of a move on which they reach the back row, they are promoted to kings.<br/><br/>Kings move and capture at the long range. It means they can move diagonally forwards and backwards over any number of empty fields. Similarly, they can capture at any distance, if the field directly behind the opposing piece is empty. A king must move to that empty field directly behind the captured piece. Removal of the captured piece is immediate and occurs during the capture, as in Turkish Checkers.<br/><br/>Capture is enforced. Multiple captures are possible. Maximum capture is not enforced. A player can choose any capturing line he wishes as long as he does not end it while the capturing piece can still do captures. Since removal of captured pieces is immediate and capture is enforced, it can happen that a king immediately reverses direction in a capture.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to block or capture all pieces of the opponent, leaving him without a legal move.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BRIEF SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Stock Rush is a Strategy Board Game that uses an Interactive Device called the &quot;Market Display&quot;.  PLAYERS WATCH THEIR STOCKS FALL, RISE, CRASH and SKYROCKET . . . RIGHT BEFORE THEIR EYES! For added excitement, players also Mine for Gold and participate in a Gold Rush!  The &quot;Game Play&quot; in Stock Rush is so unique and diverse that it spans many game categories including: Strategy, Family, Party, Simulation, Educational, Action and Adventure!<br/>  <br/>For 2 to 10 Players, Ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>DETAILED SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Game play begins on The Opening Bell space and a peg is used to keep track of the trading day.  Players can play a regular game and spend a full business week on Wall Street [Mon-Fri] or they can play a shorter game by starting on Wednesday.  The game usually ends when the trading day peg reaches &ldquo;Game Over&rdquo; which is the slot after Friday.  Other ways the game can end are: &ldquo;Market Collapse&rdquo; in which all companies go bankrupt; One player left in the game after all the other players go bankrupt and All players are trapped in a Cave In.  At the end of the game, all players liquidate [sell] their holdings to the bank and the player with the most cash wins the game.<br/><br/>STOCKS . . .<br/><br/>Players buy and sell [Trade] stocks at the current market price shown by the &quot;Market Display&quot; [4 Stocks comprise the market in the game, A,B,C and D]. The stock prices are affected by news and rumors that randomly occur throughout the course of the game. There are two types of news and rumors that occur: Market News and Rumors affect the entire market; and Company News and Rumors which only affect a given individual company. Although rumors occur at random; how long they remain alive can be strategically predicted. The longer a rumor remains alive the higher the chance it will be confirmed or dispelled on the next turn. Consequently, players must trade accordingly; they must decide on 4 Criteria: [1] Buy or Sell?; [2]Which Stock to Trade?; [3] How many Shares to Trade?; and most importantly [4] When to Trade?.<br/><br/>COMMODITIES [MAINLY GOLD] . . .<br/><br/>The Stock Rush name was inspired by the California Gold Rush of 1849. As a result, a significant portion of the game is dedicated to that historical event. Players randomly mine for Gold and participate in many Gold Rushes throughout the game. During a &ldquo;Gold Rush&rdquo; players may become trapped in a &ldquo;Cave In&rdquo;.  Trapped players may escape on their own or be rescued by other players.  <br/>Once players accumulate Gold they may strategically sell any amount they wish on the &quot;Gold Exchange Market&quot;. They must sell according to 3 Criteria:<br/>[1] How much Gold to Sell? [2] At What Price to Sell? [3] When to Sell?  The other commodities in the game are Groceries, Toys, Clothes and Gear&hellip;the STUFF we use in our everyday life.<br/><br/>",

The object is to get the highest score after six rounds.  Each of the two dice has number on five of the six sides, and a skull on the sixth side.<br/><br/>Determine which player goes first by any convenient method.  First player rolls both dice.  If no skulls are showing, the player adds the numbers showing to his score for the round.  He he has the option of rolling again, or passing the dice to the next player.  If he passes the dice, his turn is over, and the score he has rolled so far is &quot;protected.&quot;  If he rolls again, he may get more points, but he may also lose all the points he has received so far that round.  A player may continue to roll the dice until he decides to pass them, or until he rolls one or more skulls.  If a player rolls one skull, he loses all the points he has gained that round, and gets a score of zero for the round.  He must then pass the dice to the next player.  If a player rolls two skulls, he loses all the points he as gained that round, and in all previous rounds.  He is completely wiped out, and must start again the next round.  He must pass the dice to the next player.<br/><br/>After all the players have had a chance to roll the dice, draw a line under the scores to signify that the scores above the line are &quot;protected&quot; (i.e., cannot by wiped out the the roll of a single skull).  Note that each player must roll the dice at least once each round.<br/><br/>Subsequent rounds:  In the following rounds, players roll the dice in the order of their score so far.  The player with the highest score at they end of the first round will roll first for the second round.  The player with the second highest score will roll second, and so on.  There is an advantage to rolling last, so we give that position to the player who is losing the worst.  If two players are tied for score, they may roll a dice or flip a coin to determine which must roll first.<br/><br/>At the end of six rounds the player with the highest score wins.  If two players are tied for the highest score, then all players must roll another round.<br/><br/>Hint:  although the odds of rolling a skull on any one roll are always exactly the same as any other roll, the more times you roll in one round, the more points you are rising on any one roll.<br/><br/>Flying Buffalo Inc.

Half an hour later, 48,000 Canadian soldiers left their trenches to assault the impregnable Vimy Ridge. The French and the British had previously tried to capture the ridge but to no avail. On this battlefield the Canadians were to prove themselves. At 2:00 PM the Canadian troops held the ridge.<br/><br/>Vimy Ridge is a simulation of the Canadian attack. The game covers the battle from the initial barrage to the final objectives reached by 1st Division.<br/><br/>Vimy Ridge is the re-release of the game Vimy Ridge: 1917 formerly published by Pacific Rim. There are minimal changes in the rules but the graphics have been substantially changed.<br/><br/>",

Tasked by the Emperor to explore ancient temples, forgotten labyrinths, and beast-haunted caverns, they seek out artifacts hidden by the gods themselves, hunt creatures of myth, and face enemies that would use dark magic against the empire.<br/><br/>Broken Legions: Fantasy Skirmish Wargames in the Roman Empire is a set of fantasy skirmish rules for a war unknown to history, fought in the shadows of the Roman Empire. Various factions recruit small warbands to fight in tight, scenario-driven battles that could secure the mystical power to defend &mdash; or crush &mdash; Rome. A points system allows factions to easily build a warband, and mercenaries and free agents may also be hired to bolster a force. Heroes and leaders may possess a range of skills, traits, and magical abilities, but a henchman's blade can be just as sharp, and a campaign can see even the lowliest henchman become a hero of renown.<br/><br/>Mark Latham's blog, which provides additional rules, discussion, and FAQS.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://thelostvictorian.blogspot.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://thelostvictorian.blogspot.com/</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Egg Farmer is a simple but fun family-friendly game which involves the collection of eggs in a 'basket pile'. Players take turns drawing from the Egg Deck, building up eggs in hand which can be banked in the basket pile or spent on a Farm Deck card, which will defend against the foxes which appear in the Egg Deck. Hungry foxes eat your chickens and thieving foxes steal eggs in hand. Only banked eggs are safe and will be counted up at the end. The last-person standing collects unbanked eggs from other players and adds them to their total.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To investigate, simply flip a card to take a closer look. An item intrigues you? Flip the card over and find out what the little piece of paper on the bedside table is.<br/><br/>An address? You can now take the card that corresponds to this track. Unless another element on the crime scene appeals you even more?<br/><br/>In Crime Zoom, you will conduct your investigation freely. Discuss among players to choose the tracks to follow. When you think you have solved the case, go to the questionnaire. Who is guilty? What is their motive? What is the murder weapon? And some follow-up questions, of course.<br/><br/>Make sure to identify the culprit, otherwise you will lose the game. But if you answer the questions correctly, the number of cards you do not reveal will determine your score.<br/><br/>The solution will answer each of the questions. The epilogue will tell the whole story or a testimony history to understand the plot that has been played.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Three weeks before his defeat at Hastings, King Harold Godwinson surprised his brother Tostig and King Harald Hardrada of Norway and won a decisive, if costly victory against the Vikings.<br/><br/>At the heart of the game is a simple turn structure in which players choose two phases to perform: Retreat, Shield Wall, Move, or Combat. Players can also perform two Move Phases in a single turn, two separate Combat phases, or a more powerful-- if bloody-- Pitched Combat. Combat resolution is quick and accurately represents the brutal, costly nature of linear warfare of the period.<br/><br/>As leadership of the Viking forces passes from one leader to another, the rules of the game are changed, imparting a sense of historical narrative while giving both players an equal chance of victory.<br/><br/>",

For each chip placed next to the correct invention card, players receive a point. These points can be wagered in future rounds. Whoever has the highest score after 5 rounds, wins!<br/><br/>The Invention Deck has one Invention per year with no duplicate years. They include a wide variety of inventions in consecutive years spanning from the late 1890's to the 1970's. Inventions are easily recognizable but just obscure enough that each game will be a challenge!<br/><br/>",

There is no trump suit and suits do not matter.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, six cards are dealt to each player. On their turn, players play a single card to the table from their hand. After both players have played their single card, the &quot;trick&quot; is resolved. The highest card always takes the trick. The loser of the trick draws a card from the deck and adds it to their hand.<br/><br/>Tricks score points equal to the difference between values of the two cards in the trick. The alley cat (5 of diamonds) is a special card that causes negative points to a player's overall score for a round.<br/><br/>The game is over when one player reaches 44 or more points, thus winning the game.<br/><br/>",

If a tree is potentially in the line-of-sight, the player peers through a miniature periscope placed on the battlefield; if at least 50% of the enemy model is visible, then the unit may fire. Combat is resolved with a single six-sided die roll that is cross-referenced on a Hit Chart, that takes into account the statistics of both the offensive and defensive units.<br/><br/>",

Starting with a colored personal token and six black or grey neutral tokens, each player's goal is to move his or her personal token to the finishing point.<br/><br/>The nodes are interlinked by directional gateways.  A node can have only one entry route from another node, but it might have exits to two others.  Token movement follows the rule that to enter a node, all entries through the gateway must be occupied, and its exits clear.  Players take turns to place their tokens and move everyone's tokens if movement conditions are satisfied, taking back neutral tokens under certain circumstances.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the finishing point wins.  The game ends at that point if the players agree, or they can play till all positions are decided.<br/><br/>",

Very unlike the modern 'German Games' this is a strategic war game of epic battles and diplomacy set in the world 'Magira'. This fantasy world was described by its authors (chiefly Hugh Walker aka Hubert Strassl) in a series of popular German pulp novels.<br/><br/>It carries the tag line 'Das ewige Spiel' (the eternal game), as some particular sessions of this game have been played semi-continuously for the past 30 years by members of the associated society 'FOLLOW'. This version of the rules was published in 1990 by the EDFC (Erster Deutscher Fantasy Club e.V.).<br/><br/>The game's fascinating roots date back to the late 60's when Fantasy literature and war-gaming was virtually unknown in Germany. Society members started to imagine and describe various cultures for their shared fictive world, and enacted the history through the board game in sporadic sessions throughout the following years.<br/><br/>With this edition of the base rules (as well as several available supplements) everybody can enter the world of Magira and decide its fate in various levels of play, from tactical skirmishes to the simulation of a whole fantasy world.<br/><br/>Contents: 84 A4-Page Rules in 18 separate chapters with 8 maps of Magira. 1 square meter playing field and 521 counters on 24 A4&shy; cardboard sheets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Azacru has one objective: to have as many squares of your color on the board at the end of the game. There two very different dynamics at work in the game. Since you cannot land on a square of another player's color, part of the game focuses on blocking opposition pieces and avoiding being blocked. However the game features a &quot;connection change&quot; move which involves pre-planning so that you can move one of your pieces several squares across to another square already of your color. Potentially this could be right across the board, which is a 9 by 9 grid.<br/><br/>Each time a piece moves the square it lands on becomes its own color, and the number of colored squares it has in one of the nine 3x3 borderlands on the game board determines the power of movement the piece has.<br/><br/>If the connection change involves changing a square of opposition color then your piece leaves the game, but this can also be to your advantage since the game ends shortly after the first person playing is in a position where they cannot move any pieces. So players strive to get ahead on squares and then cause any early end to the game ... or wait so that they can make a dramatic connection change on the last turn that follows the first person being unable to move.<br/><br/>Azacru is one of the games featured in the Pacru Series 302 game box of 2005 (the games all use the same board, pieces/chevrons and markers). Separate entries exist for Pacru, Shacru &amp; Azacru.<br/><br/>",

In the game, you control the climber's hands and feet and also the position of the body in relation to the extremities. Find a way to move upwards choosing spots that are strong enough to support your weight.<br/><br/>The tiles make up the wall and the coins (suit up) the spots you can hold on to. 4 dice represent your 4 extremities and a pawn your &quot;center of gravity&quot;. When you place an extremity in a spot you can hold on to, you flip the coin and it shows the maximum weight it can support. In addition, the farther an extremity is from the &quot;center of gravity&quot; the less weight it can support too. After moving the die to the new spot, you place it showing the weight it supports. The trick is to support your whole weight between the 4 extremities. Then, move your center of gravity to a new position where you can reach newer spots, finding your way through the wall.<br/><br/>",

As its name implies, LI deals with combat on the ground in the same period. The kings of the battlefield are huge fighting machines, the Ironclads of the title, which cross the landscape on tracks, wheels or even primitive mechanical legs, dealing destruction wherever they go. Small steam-driven machines, known as contraptions and akin to the tanks of the First World War, scurry between the hulking ironclads creating their own smaller form of mayhem. More conventional infantry, cavalry and artillery units, albeit augmented with all manner of fantastic weaponry, add to the confusion. Giant aeronef, dirigibles and winged aircraft fight their own battles in the sky while raining down bombs on the units below.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Steam Lords is a game of resource management for 2 ruthless players. To win you must use your resources wisely to construct 12 victory points worth of buildings along the Shale River which runs through the different quarters of the City of Iron.<br/><br/>Needed to play: the deck of 34 cards and 35 markers per player in 2 colors.<br/><br/>Setup: Place the 4 Quarter Cards comprising the map of the Shale River between players.<br/><br/>The 4 quarters of the city each have 6 buildings on them that can be constructed by players. Each building is worth 1 victory point towards the goal of 12. Further, each building allows players to use the special power of that quarter of the city to place more workers, distribute resources or purchase cards in the game.<br/><br/>Next each player takes a set of the 5 Industry Cards: Foundry, Trade Guild, Civil Service, Builders and Shipwrights and places them below their side of the river.<br/><br/>Industry Cards are used to construct the buildings along the river by placing resources on the 5 icons on each card. Once enough resources have been accrued, players may construct one of the buildings, though each industry type only constructs one or two particular types of building based on which Quarter Cards the industries are adjacent to.<br/><br/>Next each player takes a set of the 4 Resource Cards: Brick Kiln, Textile Mill, Lumbermill and Smelter. Players shuffle these cards and randomly lay them out below the Industry Cards. Place the Contract Card within reach of both players. Then lay out the 11 Upgrade Cards face up within reach of both players.<br/><br/>Lastly, players each take 4 of their 30 eurocube markers and place them on four icons on any of their Industry Cards. Players may only place a marker on one each of the four resource types. Each card shows icons for a different resource type used in the game to construct the buildings and purchase upgrade cards.<br/><br/>Play: Steam Lords is divided into rounds of four phases. Players take turns during phases 1, 3 and 4, and play simultaneously during phase 2. Players will alternate going first between rounds, with Player One going first in the first round, Player Two going first in the 2nd round, etc... Once all 4 phases have been completed, a new round begins.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Contract<br/>Players take turns placing 5 workers (eurocube markers) on the Contract Card claiming either resources or distribution rights.<br/>Phase 2: Distribute<br/>Players simultaneously distribute resources, moving markers from the Resource Cards to the Industry Cards.<br/>During this phase, each player may &lsquo;deliver&rsquo; any resources for a total of 5 card units in distance. To calculate distance, count the number of cards up and over to the left or right you wish to move a resource.<br/>Phase 3: Build<br/>Players take turns constructing buildings on the Quarter Cards if they have all 5 resources needed on their Industry Cards.<br/>If a player has all 5 icons marked on an Industry Card, they may remove those markers and construct any of the unclaimed buildings on a Quarter Card. Once all 6 buildings have been constructed no more can be claimed. Each building built on a Quarter Card is worth 1VP.<br/>Phase 4: Upgrade<br/>Players take turns buying Upgrade Cards one at a time, and may only buy Upgrade Cards if they have built buildings in Coalside during phase 3. For each building built in Coalside, a player may buy 1 Upgrade Card during this phase. To purchase an Upgrade Card, a player must pay the number of resources shown at the bottom of each Upgrade Card. They may then take the card and place it in front of them.<br/><br/>Four of the Upgrade Cards allow players to store additional resources on the Resource Cards. After purchasing one of the four cards replace the existing Resource Card with the new one. Each of these cards is worth 2VP. Seven of the Upgrade Cards let you construct building with fewer resources, gain distribution units or place more workers in phase 1. The cards list their respective upgrades.<br/><br/>An expanded set of 12 additional cards has also been included for a longer game.<br/><br/>Artscow direct order - <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.artscow.com/gallery/playing-cards/steam-lords-wym0ul1sbgjg\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.artscow.com/gallery/playing-cards/steam-lords-wym...</a><br/><br/>",

The players who manage to survive the game and perform outstandingly well are virtually elevated to the rank of Divinities and are named the ULTRAs. <br/> In ULTRIUM SPHERE, each player is the leader of an Ultrium Sphere team, which he/she tries to lead to victory.<br/>Each team consists of two decks:  25 Ultra Cards and 25 Interaction Cards. The Ultra Cards represent the team members and describe their race and various characteristics, offensive (tackling, attack, shot) and defensive (resistance, save, pass). The Interaction cards are the different strategies that the team can apply. <br/>At the beginning of the game, each player draws 4 Interaction Cards and 6 Ultra Cards. The 6 Ultras are to be laid out in two lines, the attack line and the defense line (3 Ultras in each line). The Interaction cards stay in hand. <br/>The Ultras can be used either for their special ability or to carry out various actions according to their place on the field. The strikers can undermine the opponent&rsquo;s defense (tackling, attack) or try to shoot a goal. The defenders can make passes to strikers (a pass must take place prior to every shot at goal) or stop the opponent&rsquo;s shots. The player must activate the Ultras (i.e. turn them at a 90-degree angle) when he/she uses them. Once activated, the Ultras can no longer be used. Therefore, the player must not activate all his/her Ultras during his/her turn, since the activated Ultras will not be able to defend during the opponent&rsquo;s turn. When the player chooses to play an action, he/she must cast a 12-sided die and add the Ultra&rsquo;s personal bonus for the action chosen. To know whether the action succeeds or not, the player compares the total to a success threshold, which must be exceeded or not depending on the type of action.<br/>The Interaction card may be used at any time to strengthen one&rsquo;s own Ultras or weaken the opponent&rsquo;s Ultras. <br/>When the turn begins, the player draws 1 Interaction card and set all his/her Ultras upright. First, he/she can replace Ultras and have 2 Ultras swap place. He/she can then use the Ultras and Interaction cards.<br/>When the player can no longer or does no longer want to carry out any action, or when he/she scores a goal, his/her turn ends and the opponent can begin his/her turn.<br/>The game goes on until one of the players scores 3 goals.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Twenty-Two is a simple round game for two or more players. There is no maximum number of players, but over 6, you need to add a second deck of cards. It is a trick-taking game in which the winner of the last trick is penalized.<br/><br/>Suits are irrelevant in this game.<br/><br/>The players look at their cards, and starting at dealer&rsquo;s left, each in turn (in clockwise order) has one opportunity to discard cards face down and receive an equal number of cards in exchange from the top of the undealt portion of the pack.<br/><br/>Then, the first player leads to the trick. When playing to a trick there are two possibilities:<br/><br/>You may equal or beat the highest card or set of cards played to the trick so far.<br/>    If you cannot or do not wish to equal or beat the highest play, you must play the lowest cards in your hand.<br/><br/>The trick ends when everyone has played to it, and it is won by the highest play, or by the last of highest equal plays.<br/> The winner of the trick leads to the next, and may again lead a single card or a set of equal ranked cards, but you must keep back at least one card even if all your remaining cards are equal.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>When everyone is down to just one card, all players show their last card, and whoever has the highest card loses. This high card is kept face up in front of the loser for the rest of the game, to show that player&rsquo;s score. A player whose scoring cards add up to 22 or more points is eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>Based on the public domain game Cucumber<br/><br/>",

As members of the elite Vice Squad, you'll be traveling around Charm City in an attempt to build a case and catch your Suspect before the end of the Plot. Charm City Blues is completely cooperative with each player having a personal Vice that effects the way you play the game.<br/><br/>Charm City Blues is played on a 5x4 grid of cards laid out in numerical order to create Charm City. At the start of the game players will choose a Difficulty and Suspect and deal 12 cards from the Plot deck. Then, roll the d20 Clue die 4 times to spawn Clues on the Location cards with the corresponding number. The goal of the game is to build a case and catch the Suspect by filling up the Difficulty and Suspect cards with clues before the Plot deck runs out.<br/><br/>Each round of Charm City Blues is divided into two phases, the Plot phase and the Investigation phase. During the Plot phase the player with the Commissioner token flips the top card of the Plot deck. This card gives a narrative cue which the Commissioner will expand on in telling a few lines of story about the game so far. Then, each player will have a chance to gain clues during their Investigation.<br/><br/>Each player has four abilities: Fight, Arrest, Research, and Interrogate. During your investigations you will test these abilities by rolling the number of d6 listed next to your Ability and trying to match or beat the number required on the Location card. If you succeed, you move the Clue up to the Difficulty or Suspect card and gain some cold hard cash. If you fail, you lose Hit Points or gain Suspicion Points. Lose too many Hit Points or gain too may Suspicion Points and the game is over.<br/><br/>",

You must choose your crew wisely to achieve this goal, then effectively command them throughout the voyage to ensure your cargo is intact when you finally dock. You will issue firing orders, request scans, change power priorities, assign repairs, adjust speed and you can even take a detour to investigate areas of interest. All the while, pirates will be attacking you in an attempt to knock out your engines, shields and weapons, thereby allowing them to board your ship and loot the cargo.<br/><br/>At the end of the mission, you will be paid for any cargo you have remaining, but you will also have an bonuses and expenses to factor into your final pay - bonuses consist of bounties for pirates destroyed, or an early arrival bonus if you manage to get there before your ETA - expenses include fines for any neutral targets you may have killed, and repair costs which can be astronomical if your ship is too badly beaten up.<br/><br/>This was an entry into the 2016 Solitaire PNP Design Contest<br/>Winner - Best Sci-Fi Themed Game<br/>2nd place - Best Advanced PnP Build<br/>2nd place - Best Original Artwork<br/>3rd place - Best Graphic Design<br/>5th place - Best Written Rulebook<br/><br/>",

The Quester then picks the winning answer. The player with the most winning answers wins the game.<br/><br/>Understand the game in 4 basic steps.<br/><br/>1. Draw a card, read a question to the group, and roll 9 random charms onto the board. Remove &quot;out of play&quot; charms.<br/><br/>2. Use the KEY CARD to review charm meanings. Other players quickly write an answer to your question based on the charms, where they landed on the board, and what this could mean for you.<br/><br/>3. The answers are read aloud. You pick the one that best answers your question, and the author is revealed as the winner of the round.<br/><br/>4. Pass the charms to the left and play again until everyone has asked a question. The player who writes the most winning answers is crowned the Charms Champion of Insight!<br/><br/>",

Each player takes control of a unique bee species and chooses a unique hive location to build upon. They will play through three seasons acting as the queen bee to harvest nectar and pollen, lay and mature larva, explore the world, and build their hive.<br/><br/>Each round begins with a pollen reward based on the season that players are in and the hexes that players have built into their hives. Pollen is the currency that players take to do their actions. Starting with the starting player which rotates each round, each player will take 1 action per turn until a player either passes or runs out of pollen. Once that happens no additional pollen can be awarded through pollen rewards that round. A round ends when all players have passed or run out of pollen.<br/><br/>Players can move their bees to uncover hive hexes from the field which allows them to decide on receiving a one time pollen reward for that hex or pay its cost to purchase immediately before any other player. They may also move to bee quests which grant end-game victory points, to the waggle dance track which gives players access to their own exclusive field with special abilities, to their hive bank where all pollen and nectar is stored, or to the hive hexes where larva is layed and matured. Field hexes also contain random seasonal challenges which when explored will cause trouble based on the season.<br/><br/>Other than moving, players may choose to harvest nectar from the field which is used to mature larva based on the color of flowers purchased into the hive, they may lay larva, buy hexes based on the seasonal chart and the location of their bees, and they may mature larva as actions on their turn. As players build their hive they will unlock permanent upgrades to their abilities.<br/><br/>The game ends when someone has completed their hive or when the end of the season track is reached.<br/><br/>Victory points are calculated based on the number of flowers on the hexes purchased into their hive, the number of worker bees they have alive, the pollen in their hive bank, and any completed quests.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What can you see at first?<br/><br/>There are two coal armies lined up against each other. In the terrain where they move, every square obligates the characters to transform. When a character moves to a square of transformation, it has to change, but not only it&rsquo;s appearance  will be different, but it&rsquo;s ability to move and attack will be also changed.<br/><br/>3 characters, 2 teams, 1 battle<br/><br/>If I want to look for a similar game to Carbomorphozis, the first game that comes to my mind is the great, classic chess. Checkered board with 64 squares, 8 puppets, step and punch actions. However, while chess pieces are diverse with many features, we only have to count on 3 characters. And as long as everything is given in chess and victory depends solely on tactics, in Carbomorphozis the characters change from one step to another and this influences the outcome of the party and the applied military plan.<br/><br/>This board game is educational as well, because it combines three types of carbon in our minds for a lifetime. Thanks to the variety of the board, there are 256 different playing fields.<br/><br/>You can start the game on any side, giving you 1024 different play options, so the chance of repeating play is 1 to 1000, it means you won't get bored during the replays.<br/><br/>The playing time is relatively short, 20-30 minutes, so it is suitable for you if you have just little freetime. It doesn't need too much preparation, just take it out from the box and the game can begin. Another advantage is that it does not take place on too much space, so you can play it even while traveling by train.<br/><br/>I walk, I walk ... but what will happen to me when I stop?<br/><br/>The main driver of the game is transformation. Since it is a transformation of coal, the name of the game is the result of the fusion of the Latin name of carbon (carbon) and the Latin word for transformation (metamorphosis).<br/><br/>The pictograms on the game board symbolize a transformation. The given square determines what character should step on it in order that the carbomorphosis  can occur. It also specifies the new material structure.<br/><br/>Coal here or there&hellip; or is it already graphite?<br/><br/>There are three actions that you can take in the game: move, punch and transform. The first one and the second one are the player's decision, and the third one is the result of that decision. It is determined by the player&rsquo;s move with the selected character or the square where the character is moved after the punch.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to beat all of your opponent's characters on the playing field. The more valuable our puppets are, the easier the task is for us and the harder for the opponent.<br/><br/>The game is as loose as the connection between the layers of graphite<br/><br/>What do we obtain with this game? The game primarily focuses on concentration and foresight, and therefore develops tactical skill. Because the rule is simple and easy to understand, the character's stepping and punching features are depicted on the characters themselves, and the transformations on the game board, so there is no need to learn the rules separately. The game can be started instantaneously and does not require lengthy learning.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, circumstances change so this board game is suitable for the more impatient children, too ; because it inspires them to make flexible decisions and modify easily  the previously planned steps.<br/><br/>If the players are children, the game can match to their forward thinking, which is only 1-2 steps. But nevertheless, it may require 4-5 step forward thinking from adult players, so the same game can be fun for all ages.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Some are sentenced to life, but you don't plan on staying that long.<br/>Get ready to escape Alcatraz with nine routes based on real life attempts.<br/>Don't get caught on land.<br/>Don't get killed in the water.<br/>----<br/><br/>The game is a competitive, dice rolling, and card collecting game featuring 2-4 Players. Play begins at The Warden Johnston boat, named after the longest-serving Warden of Alcatraz.<br/><br/>There are three phases of the game Processing, Doing Time and Escape.<br/><br/>During Processing, players take turns rolling two d6 dice to move and sometimes fight with each other if they land on the same space. The goal here is to arrive fastest at the Main Cell house in order to have the advantage of choosing an Inmate Card. Some inmate cards start with a tool, representing a tool that that inmate used in a real escape attempt.<br/><br/>Doing time begins!  Players take turns circling the board through the Mess Hall, Recreation Yard, Laundry, and Model Industries by rolling two d6 dice on their turn. Landing on colored arrows grants a card of that color. The goal here is to collect Planning and Escape Cards. Each player may have up to 4 of each color card, all the while consulting their Escape Chart in order to plan their best escape route.<br/><br/>Certain cards like Model Prisoner give you special access to Grounds Escapes.  Guard cards can be good or bad news when landing on black spaces.

        "description": "Fable on Your Table is a print-and-play &quot;roguelike&quot; miniatures game where you take on the role of an adventurer and plunge into a dungeon trying to complete an objective.<br/><br/>Play out the battles with papercraft miniatures you cut out and assemble (or use your own!), guided by the companion web app that procedurally generates the dungeons you explore.  When you complete a quest, you level up.  Level up five times to ascend and win the game!<br/><br/>The miniatures rules may also be used for general tabletop miniatures play with scenarios you invent. The rules are generic enough that they can be used with your own miniatures and terrain, and there are even rules for playing grid-less.<br/><br/>To play the game in the manner intended you need to use the companion app/website, but you could also use Fable on your Table as a miniatures skirmish system for a TTRPG experience, and make up your own scenarios.  The app is there to enable solo play, but the system itself doesn't rely on the app to work, any more than any other TTRPG combat system does.  For instance, you could write up your own adventures and share them with friends, and it would work perfectly fine.<br/><br/>",

If they look at the baked good card, they can add it to the stack of orders to be fulfilled, or discard it and hide one of the eight notes with the magic spells on them.<br/><br/>When only one player remains, they attempt to bake all of the bread. Each bread card has a die combination that needs to be made. They only get a single roll, but the remaining spell cards  will help them reroll or manipulate the dice, and they can bribe other players to reroll the dice for them.<br/><br/>If a player succeeds, they earn the tip pool and the value of all of the items they baked. If they fail, they get nothing; the second time they fail, they are fired (eliminated from the game.)<br/><br/>The goal is to be the first to get to a set goal of money, or the last person still employed.<br/><br/>",

Your guild competes and slays the invading monsters to save the Kingdom of Nayvar and take the throne. WarRift brings fresh mechanics to the genre, like each player having their own signature buy-pool (guild), instead of all players getting cards from the same spot.<br/><br/>If you don't pay the extra cost on a card, it goes into the Rift. Cards in the Rift have a chance of an opponent using it for one turn, making for some powerful plays. There's also bartering, intense player-elimination, the ability for players to hold cards in their hand and time their combos, monster bosses, casual and solo formats, and a lot more. With all its elements at play, WarRift creates a completely unique deck-building experience fit for a KING!<br/><br/>Rules and rulings and more can be found at WarRift.com<br/><br/>",

This game is meant to get you moving. It will exercise your body, your mind, and your funny bone. It&rsquo;s the kind of game where parents and kids are equal, and you could finish in 20 minutes, or spend an entire rainy day playing.<br/>Participants divide into two teams. There are four decks of cards, each with a different type of challenge: Faceoff, Guess It, Find It, or Act It. The teams take turns spinning a spinner to choose the category of the current challenge. Each team will have a chance to defeat a challenge from the category.<br/>If the category is Guess It, contestants try to get their team to correctly guess the missing word, &quot;BLOBS&quot;, of well known song lyrics in the allotted time, replacing one or two words with BLOBS. If the category is Act It, contestants act out clues charades style in the allotted time for one point for each guessed correctly. If the category is Find It, contestants must find an item in their vicinity that matches the stated clue, one point per successful find in the allotted time. If the category is Faceoff, the two teams face off on a physical challenge (like &quot;spin around 10 times as fast as you can&quot;) or a mental challenge (like &quot;name all the fruits&quot;) and the team to meet the physical challenge first or be the last team standing in the mental challenge wins 3 points.<br/>The first team to score 20 points wins. Ambitious teams are challenged to go to 40 points! House rules are encouraged.<br/><br/>Created in the minds of the virally funny Holderness Family and brought to you by the creators of Watch Ya&rsquo; Mouth.<br/><br/>",

Questions are along the lines of these two: &quot;What do you like the most in bed?&quot; &quot;What would you do for &euro;500?&quot; The active player determines how they would answer these questions, e.g., A3, then lays face down the answer card containing this letter-number combination. Each other player lays down a card matching what they think the active player will say, after which all the cards are revealed, and whoever guessed correctly scores a point. The first player to score 5 points wins.<br/><br/>The twist in Privacy Duo is that each player has only three answer cards: one showing A1/B2/C3, a second showing A2/B3/C1, and a third showing A3/B1/C2.

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The Battle of Mollwitz, April 10, 1741, was the first field battle between the Austrians and the Prussians in what the Prussians called the First Silesian War. While the Austrian Empire was in the throes of a succession crisis and was threatened by other countries, &quot;Frederick the Great&quot; (Friedrich II of Prussia) seized the Austrian province of Silesia. When the Austrians did react, they placed an army between Frederick and Prussia. Frederick turned and approached the Austrians in a snow storm. He had to defeat the Austrian army to re-establish his lines of communication.<br/><br/>Comment:<br/><br/>Battle of Mollwitz is a free beginner-level desktop-published (DTP) game by Chris Salander published by online boardgaming magazine The Boardgaming Life. The game comes in a PDF file comprising rules, map and 24 counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Abstract - a paint by number game<br/><br/>Overview: You are a talented artist who specializes in abstract art. Paint/Roll your way to the next masterpiece!<br/>Players: 1 - 100+<br/>Game Time: 20 minutes<br/>Items needed: 5 six-sided dice<br/>        Optional - Markers/Crayons/Pencils of the 6 colors to make your work of art beautiful (Purple, Blue, Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red)<br/><br/>Setup: Determine the End Goals for this game. Roll a die for each of the three end goals (A, B, C). These three goals are how to earn points from your painting, the other goals that were not rolled are ignored for this game.<br/><br/>The game is played over 12 rounds, with players playing simultaneously, trying to earn the most points. All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, assigning however each player determines.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Each Round you will Roll 5 dice and then use the dice to mark two numbers on your painting and also gain a bonus. From the 5 dice, two of those dice will be used to place a number on your painting, then another two dice will be used to place another number on your painting, and the 5th die will be used to gain the corresponding bonus. These markings can be done in any order.<br/><br/>- Roll 5 dice - Roll the 5 dice. Write the numbers in the top right corner on the current round&rsquo;s track. This is just used as a helpful reference.<br/><br/>- Use dice for painting two numbers and gaining a bonus<br/>In any order, do these three actions without using the same die more than once:<br/><br/>Paint a number in a square - use two dice, one for the placement location and the other for the number/paint color used. <br/>    Example: You choose a die with a 1 and a die with a 3. You use the 1 for the placement location, so the number placed will need to be in one of the unused squares in the &ldquo;1&rdquo; grid. You choose the 3 as the number/paint color used in that square. You write a 3 in one of the open squares in the 1 grid.<br/>    If you there are no available squares in a die&rsquo;s location, you may not choose that.<br/><br/>Paint a number in a square - Do this again, same as above. You must use dice that have not been used.<br/><br/>Gain a Bonus - use a die to gain one of the three bonuses. Use a 1 or 2 to gain a &ldquo;+/- 1&rdquo; to use now or later, use a 3 or 4 to gain a &ldquo;place anywhere&rdquo; to use now or later, and use a 5 or 6 to gain a Star. Each star is worth 1 point at the end of the game and gives no other bonus.<br/><br/>Reminder: you can do these three actions in any order. There are times when gaining the bonus first allows you to paint a more helpful square for your painting.<br/><br/>Repeat this each round (rolling 5 dice and using those 5 dice) until 12 rounds have been completed.<br/><br/>Important Note: If you ever cannot place one of your numbers on your painting, mark an X anywhere you choose in a square on your painting. Each X&rsquo;ed space on your painting is negative 1 point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Using your Bonuses: You may use your bonuses at any time during the game. When you gain a bonus, circle it. When used, cross it off to show it has been used. You may spend multiple bonuses in the same round. As your painting fills up, it becomes more difficult to place your numbers. It can be especially helpful to save some bonuses to use in the last rounds of the game.<br/><br/>Using +/- 1 Dice Bonus: When used, you may increase or decrease one of the dice numerically by one. This can be used to change a die to help with placing the die, the number/color of the die, or for gaining a bonus.<br/><br/>Using Place Anywhere Bonus: When used, you may use one of your dice to place the number of another die anywhere. <br/>    Example: You have a 1 and a 3 for placement and number/color. All of your squares are filled in your &ldquo;1 grid&rdquo; and your &ldquo;3 grid&rdquo;. You spend a Place Anywhere bonus to change your 1 die to a Place Anywhere. You then choose to place the number/color 3 in the 5 grid, where it is advantageous for your end goals and where there is also an available square.<br/><br/>Star Bonus: Each star is worth 1 point at the end of the game and gives no other bonus. You&rsquo;re a star!<br/><br/>Each End Goal Explained:<br/>End Goal A: Earn points for matching shapes of the same number/color. The orientation of the shape can be mirrored and/or flipped in any way, as long as it is the same shape. You cannot use the same number twice for shapes. You can use these numbers for B and C end goals<br/>End Goal B: Earn points for each pair of these numbers anywhere on your painting. These two numbers do not need to be connected. Example: You have placed three 1&rsquo;s and five 2&rsquo;s in your painting. You have three pairs (set of 1&amp;2, 1&amp;2, and 1&amp;2), so you earn 6 points; 2 per pair.<br/>End Goal C: This goal is looking at unique numbers in either rows, columns, or grids. If you fulfill this goal in multiple rows/columns/grids, you score each time it is fulfilled.<br/><br/>End of Game:<br/>After you have completed the 12th roll/round, total your points earned from each End Goal, one point for each Star bonus, and subtract one point for each X on your painting (unpainted squares). The player with the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>Look at your amazing masterpiece and name it and autograph it.<br/><br/>For those who want to take it to the next level: When marking numbers, you can use coordinating colors (color key in top left of page). After finishing, you can fill in the boxes completely with the corresponding colors to beautify your work of art.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each games takes only an hour or so to play.<br/><br/>Japan possessed a small but well-trained military forces at the time. To reflect this, their Units cost a little more, but also have a better chance to carry out their orders. Their smaller geographical area makes for more intense combat with fewer movement options. The Martians have 3 Tripods in each Wave. Japan only pays 3 PP to build Harbors, and only pay 1 PP to move Units during the Production step. Battles in Japan will be close-in, intense, and highly mobile. Overall, the game will have a frantic feel.<br/><br/>",

You've made your mournful public statement (&quot;tragic day,&quot; etc), and now you're ready to hatch your devious plot to steal the newly vacant Supreme Seat and claim Absolute Power for yourself. You only need to outmaneuver your fellow ministers - but they're a heap of low-watt gizmos, how hard could that be? Let the machinations begin!<br/><br/>Power Vacuum is a 1-5 player trick-taking game with some treacherous twists. The game is played over several rounds, and in each round players use tricks to adjust the Power levels of other players to work toward their hidden Agenda cards. Power is gained by winning tricks with the highest number of the led suit, but it is also gained, lost, and exchanged between players through shrewd use of the Control Board, which is manipulated by the player of the lowest card of ANY suit. If at the round's end you have fulfilled your Agenda card, successfully picking the players with the most and/or least amount of Power, you get a large bonus payout. End-of-round points are exchanged for pieces of a great statue you are building to yourself. The first player to complete their statue becomes the next Supreme Appliance!<br/><br/>Power Vacuum is not about winning every trick, but choosing the right card at the right time to engineer the rise or fall of your opponents in the short term so that you can profit the most in the long term. Additionally, each card's suit is visible on the back side, reducing the need to count your opponent's cards, so you can focus instead on the most cunning move - but watch out for Spies, the fifth suit hiding amongst the other four which will trump the trump suit. In this game, timing is everything.<br/><br/>Power abhors a vacuum - will you plug it?!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

And it's not just about remembering &mdash; your attention to detail is crucial to ensuring that the treasures of ages past don't disappear into the sands of time.&quot;<br/><br/>In Glifos, the fifth game in PaperGames Micro Line, you create a line of cards each containing a hieroglyph in one color. These cards are left revealed for 10- 20 seconds, then turned face down.<br/><br/>On each player's turn, a new card from the draw pile is revealed, and the &quot;questions&quot; section of that card will indicate a position in the row of face-down cards and what must be remembered by the player, either the hieroglyph or the color. The player must then try to remember the correct answer. If the player gets it right, they receive the card that was originally in the line; if not, the other players have the opportunity to try to remember and win the card, which is worth points. In either case, the card used to define the question then takes the place of the scored card, so the line continually changes during play, possibly causing the players' memory to fail as the game progresses.<br/><br/>When the deck of cards runs out, the player with the most points wins. Glifos can also be played co-operatively or as a solitaire game.<br/><br/>",

Now it&rsquo;s up to a group of city mayors to sort it.<br/><br/>Carbon City Zero: World Edition is a race against the clock, where players juggle their common goal (of collective survival) with local priorities. And that&rsquo;s just the start of it. From how people get from A to B, to what powers their cup of tea, every decision is a climate decision. These mayors have their work cut out for them - will they avoid climate chaos?<br/><br/>Carbon City Zero: World Edition is a revised second edition of the climate action game Carbon City Zero. This edition is a collaborative deck-building game for 1-4 people in which players develop a sustainable city by greening transport, transforming industries, getting citizens on board, and showing world leaders how it&rsquo;s done. Each player starts with an identical deck, buying additional cards from a shared marketplace to create a more sustainable city. But you need to negotiate, working together with cities around the world. Balancing the need to generate income with reducing carbon, players can follow numerous paths to victory, but collaboration is key. You&rsquo;ll need to bring together governments, industries, and the public. And if you can&rsquo;t bring carbon levels to zero before it&rsquo;s too late - we all lose. The stakes couldn&rsquo;t be higher.<br/><br/>The game also comes with the original rules for competitive and solo play.<br/><br/>In the collaborative and solo modes players win if they can bring the carbon level to zero in eight rounds or less, while in competitive games it's a race to zero - first there wins!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Sticks are placed on the lines of the board and hereby delimit regions. Black sticks must be placed so that if a completely delimited region results, this region includes at least one line on the border of the board. By doing this, at the end of the game each region can be assigned to a player, and whoever has the largest (combined) territory wins. The board has 96 triangles, each of which will be assigned to one player in the end, so ties are possible.<br/><br/>There are 24 exterior lines, each of which will be claimed by one player by the end: in a 2-player game, each player has 12 colored sticks; in a 3-player game, each player has 8 sticks; in a 4-player game, each player has 6 sticks.<br/><br/>",

It last 24 game turns.<br/><br/>This wargame was published in 1976 so would represent contemporary events.  It starts with an (undated) prediction from a South African general that the white minority regime in Rhodesia could hold out against the outside-supported guerrillas a minimum of 6 months and a maximum of 2 years.(The bulk of the population lived outside the modern world and did not care much who won).  I guess this is the timescale of the game and it is attempting to predict the military outcome.<br/><br/>",

Players compete to give away all of their money by answering questions about these paintings.  Questions are multiple choice, or players may opt to play an &quot;Expert&quot; card and answer without the multiple choice options for a greater reward.  Correct answers allow players to draw a &quot;Philanthropist&quot; card, which indicates the amount of a donation and has other effects.<br/><br/>Philanthropist: The National Gallery, London offers several variations on the game mechanics of the original, allowing players more strategic options and lifting this game above many standard trivia games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is as simple as the name. The whole of UNLOCKED is based around the theme of skeleton keys and their many components.<br/><br/>UNLOCKED features 2 decks of cards. There are the key cards, and the key component cards. The key components can be assembled to create any of the keys on the key cards.<br/><br/>The game begins with the dealer (who has already dealt every player a hand of cards). The dealer then flips the first key card over. He then draws 2 cards and then plays or discards 2 cards. Cards can either be played to build the key or can be played to do nasty little things, like destroy another players key or remove the flipped key altogether.<br/><br/>As the game continues, each player takes turns building their keys to match the one flipped. After the first key is made, 2 additional keys are flipped. The longer the key, the more points it is worth. The first player to 25 points wins.<br/><br/>It is the subtle details in this game that add to the strategy. The special cards and bluffing the other players each have their own strategies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eximo is a member of the Checkers family designed on 1 February 2013.<br/>  <br/>The game has orthogonal and diagonal movement and capture. There are no kings, only men. Men can jump without capturing. When a man reaches the last row, it frees another man.<br/><br/>Eximo is played on a 8x8 square grid. Each player starts with 16 pieces placed in predetermined locations on their side of the board (see image).<br/><br/>OBJECT<br/>Capture all your opponent's pieces by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves.<br/><br/>TURN<br/>In each turn, a player can make one of the two actions: move or capture.<br/><br/>MOVE<br/>A checker can move in 3 directions: forward or diagonally forward (north, north-east or north-west).<br/><br/>There are two types of moves: ordinary move and jumping move.<br/><br/>- ORDINARY MOVE: a checker moves to a (forward or diagonally forward) adjacent and empty square.<br/>- JUMPING MOVE: a checker jumps over a (forward or diagonally forward) adjacent friendly piece if the next square in the same direction is empty, placing the jumping checker on the next empty square. If the same player's checker can continue moving by jumping another friendly piece then it must do so. During the jumping move that checker cannot capture.<br/><br/>When there is more than one way to jump, the player may choose which piece to jump with, and which jumping option or sequence of jumps to make. The jumping sequence chosen is not required to be the one which maximizes the number of jumps; however, a player must make all available jumps in the sequence chosen.<br/><br/>CAPTURE<br/>A checker can capture in 5 directions: forward, diagonally forward, right or left (north, north-east, north-west, east or west).<br/><br/>- CAPTURE: a checker jumps over a (forward, diagonally forward, right or left) adjacent opponent's piece if the next square in the same direction is empty, placing the jumping checker on the next empty square. The opponent's piece is removed from the board immediately. If the same player's checker can continue capturing by jumping another opponent's piece then it must do so. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep capturing as long as it is possible.<br/><br/>As in the jumping move, the player chooses freely which jumping sequence to take.<br/><br/>ON THE LAST ROW<br/>When a checker reaches the other end of the board, it is removed from the board immediately and the player gets two extra-moves to make instantly: dropping two new checkers in any empty square in his own first two rows, except in the four squares on the sides.<br/>(The drop zone for Black: b1, c1, d1, e1, f1, g1, b2, c2, d2, e2, f2, g2; for White: b8, c8, d8, e8, f8, g8, b7, c7, d7, e7, f7, g7).<br/><br/>If a checker reaches the other end of the board and there isn't any empty square in the drop zone, the player loses that piece. If there is just one empty square in the drop zone, the player gets only one drop.<br/><br/>",

They&rsquo;ll enter dungeons as you command, clashing with their rivals, battling for loot all while navigating the enchantments left by the necromancer. The artefacts you&rsquo;ll find might swing things in your favour, allowing you to wield weapons of legend and to summon horrifying monsters to fight for you - with the mighty Big Blue Blob on your side, how can you fail! Fight well &amp; wisely, and bring back as much loot as you can, because only one wizard will emerge victorious!<br/><br/>Wizards &amp; Co. is a strategic board game where players aim to collect valuable magical artefacts and sets of gemstones by placing creature cards face-up and face-down around octagonal dungeon boards. When no more cards can be placed on a dungeon, a battle takes place where creature abilities are triggered in clockwise order.

So, she has to get out of her hole and explore the house to find cheese. To feed her whole family, she really needs to find lots and lots of cheese and&hellip; the more the better!<br/><br/>So she is now ready to get these delicious small golden cubes. But be careful as mousetraps are scattered all over the house. And above all, Minou, the big cat of the house, is ready to jump over her and to munch her.<br/><br/>Like Lucie, you are a small mouse ready to do anything for delicious cheese. <br/>Now go hunting but do not forget to get back into your hole in time. Otherwise, you can lose everything.<br/><br/>When you get out of your hole, you draw the first card from the pile and you place the face-up card in front of you.  Now it is time for you to make a decision with what you have on your card or just because you like taking some risks.<br/>Either you go back into your hole with your precious cheese or you draw a new card to get more.<br/>If your decision is to draw a new card, you will be facing the same options: either you go back into your hole or you keep on drawing.<br/>You can then keep on drawing, but be careful! If you draw at least 3 cats or 3 mousetraps successively, you will be caught and all the cards you have drawn during that round will be lost. They will then be the discard pile.<br/>If you decide to go back into your hole, you will get back the cards you have drawn during that round. Pile these cards, face down, in front of you. From now on, these cards will always be yours. Once your turn is over, the player on your left can start playing.<br/>The game is over as soon as all the cards are drawn. Each mouse counts the bits of cheese she has on her own cards. To win, you must have more cheese than the other players.<br/><br/>Two variants are included in the game :<br/>-cards Dog and cards Discreet mouse <br/>-six role cards<br/><br/>",

Each player uses the same starter deck of cards, but there are apparently additional sets of items available.<br/><br/>The mages can transform between werewolf, human, and vampire, depending on the cards played. Spells cost cards (resources) to play, and have a series of effects - essentially healing, direct damage, or items that affect future card play.<br/><br/>Different forms suffer different amounts of damage from various spells - a silver lightning spell, for example, affects werewolves more than humans. The different forms also have got some abilities. The werewolf for example has got the ability darkness more than night, which means the oppenents handsize is decreased by one.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to defeat your opponent a series of times, starting as a mage, and progressing to high mage, and finally to battle mage. Each rank has different life totals and has some effect on gameplay.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tExtension and deck constructionFor more experienced players are some extensions available.<br/>With the extensions you are able to setup up your own decks.<br/>Each deck consists of 80 cards. Each card with the same name and the same icon you can take up to 8 cards into your deck. If the text in the middle part of the card has got a different color, you have to take less cards.<br/>Bronze = 4 cards<br/>Silver = 2 cards<br/>Gold = 1 card only<br/><br/>You always have to play with an evil and undead transformation.<br/><br/>The extensions have got different levels.<br/>The level of baseset is simple. The extensions demon and necromancer have the levels &quot;difficult&quot; and the extension lich is &quot;profi&quot;.<br/>There are some sample decks in some articles in the web available. The next SpielXpress magazine in decembre will explain some sample decks as well.<br/><br/>Experienced players should play the game with the extensions right from the beginning.

The copper coin's sides are a peasant and a boar.  The silver coin's sides are a knight and a gryphon.

Each player manages a section of the market area, and to group the booths in their section better, players want to rearrange booths &mdash; but you can relocate booths only as long as they stay along the same alley!<br/><br/>Your own market section has booths along four horizontal and five vertical alleys, so it has five rows and six columns of booth spots. One of the spots in your 5x6 grid is empty; the other 29 spots have a booth, and each booth belongs to one of five market segments. On each turn, you move one booth horizontally or vertically to the empty spot, i.e., to the spot from where the previous booth was moved.<br/><br/>To earn points, players try to reach goals better than their opponents. The game includes twelve goals, such as having one of the five market segments grouped the best, or having two specific market segments connected the best, or having the longest straight path with one market segment or the biggest rectangular area with one market segment.<br/><br/>These goals earn you a point when you reach them first, when you overtake another player, and when you have the lead at end of the game.<br/><br/>The number of turns players have depends on the progress on the time track, so you can assess how many turns remain in the game, but you can't know for certain.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Try to keep your eye on your strategy to get the highest score. Limited edition of 150 pieces, numbered and signed by the author.<br/><br/>Each player gets four little plots on the back of the game-box. Depending on the number of empty plots, a player gets material at the beginning of his turn. Now he can use this material to build connections between his plots. There are different building-styles which are more or less difficult and therefore result in more or less points. A player can also use the already built parts of the other player, which is easier and therefore results in less points. If you manage to build very complicated connections, you'll get more points. After a while, the board will be full of chaotically arranged bridges. If something falls, you'll get penalty, so be careful! Once all plots are connected, the game is over and if you didn't plan carefully you again get a penalty.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>Solitaire Gin Rummy is a solitaire card game that can be played anywhere because you hold all the cards in your hands. It was described in Games Magazine, June 1998. Unlike other solitaire card games, which require the cards to be laid out on a flat surface, Solitaire Gin Rummy can be played in line at the grocery store, in a theater while waiting for the movie to begin, on a windy beach or on the bus. If you are interrupted, you can bundle the deck into your pocket without losing your place in the game, and take it up later.<br/><br/>The rules are designed to be as close to Gin Rummy as possible. Your opponent is the joker. Your goal is to &quot;go gin&quot; before the joker appears.<br/><br/>Place one joker in the deck, and remove the other joker. Shuffle the deck thoroughly. Deal yourself ten cards. Hold them in one hand, and either set the rest of the deck, face down, beside you, or hold it face down in your other hand. This is easier to do if you use miniature cards. If the joker appears in your hand, you can either say you lost that hand, or you can just reshuffle and start over.<br/><br/>Draw the top card from the deck and put it in your hand. Discard one card from your hand, so that you still have ten cards in your hand. Place the discarded card on the bottom of the deck. The goal is to form &quot;melds&quot; in your hand. A meld is a set of three or more cards that are either all the same kind (eg. all threes) or form a numerical sequence all in the same suit (a straight flush in poker.) If all the cards in your hand are in melds, you have &quot;gin&quot; and have won the hand. If the joker appears before you go gin, you lose.<br/><br/>Optional scoring and knocking<br/><br/>If you would like to make the game more like real gin rummy, you can keep score for several hands. The first player (you or the joker) to get 100 points wins the game.<br/><br/>If you have a gin hand, turn over the cards in the deck one at a time until the joker appears. The number of cards you turn over is your score.<br/><br/>If the joker appears before you have a gin hand, add up the values of cards you have in your hand that are not in melds, counting number cards at face value and court cards as ten. The total is the joker's score.<br/><br/>If your hand contains ten or fewer points in unmelded cards, you may &quot;knock&quot;. Stop play and figure the two scores as described above. The one with the higher score recieves the difference in scores. For example, suppose you knock when you have a three and a five unmelded in your hand. Your hand counts eight points for the joker. You count the cards in the deck until the joker appears, and there are ten cards, which counts as ten points for you. Instead of giving ten points to you and eight to the joker, just give yourself two points, (ten minus eight.) If you scored and the joker scored ten, you would give the joker two points.<br/><br/>If you knock and the joker turns out to have the higher score (that is, there are more points in unmelded cards than there are cards above the joker in the deck), the joker receives 25 bonus points for &quot;undercutting the knock.&quot; If you get gin while playing with this rule, you recieve 25 bonus points.<br/><br/>I usually don't keep score; it's more fun for me just to play a quick hand. But because there's so much chance involved in where the joker will be, keeping score over several games would give you a better idea of how well you're playing in general. You could have a goal of improving your average over time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This format of Sabacc is sold exclusively aboard the Star Wars: Galactic Starcruiser at Disney's Hollywood Studios.  It uses different components and slightly different rules than the version sold in Blackspire Outpost. Like &quot;Corellian Spike&quot; Sabaac, the deck includes 30 green positive cards with values of 1 through 10 (3 each), 30 red negative cards with values of -1 through -10 (3 each), and two black cards with values of 0.  However, unlike that version, there are also two custom dice, one which shows suits (square, circle, triangle) and one which shows a number value (0,0,5,-5,10,-10).<br/><br/>The object of the game is to score as close as possible to the number rolled on the gold die.  The silver suit die is used as a tie breaker if two players have the same value.  Suit values are per card, so two triangle cards would be two triangles, no matter what the value of the card shows.<br/><br/>Once the dealer has rolled the dice, he deals five cards to each player.  Players then calculate their hands, and save as many cards as they would like face down.   Then the &quot;Shift&quot; phase occurs, which allows players to get new cards for cards they did not save, returning their hands to 5 cards.  The &quot;Improve&quot; step is adding newly acquired cards to their face down saved cards pile, if they wish.  The improve cards may alternatively be discarded.  Finally, players &quot;Reveal&quot; their face down cards to see who came closest to the dice value goal.<br/><br/>Betting chips are not included in the game, but a round of betting after the deal, &quot;Shift&quot; and &quot;Improve&quot; phases is assumed.  This is also how game play works in the electronic Sabacc table version you can play in the Sublight Lounge on the Galactic Starcruiser. Once all players have had a chance to deal, the game ends and the player with the most betting chips wins.<br/><br/>&quot;Coruscant Shift&quot; has also removed the hand ranking complexity of &quot;Corellian Spike&quot;.  If two or more players have equal hands, even after the suits tie breaker, players split the pot.<br/><br/>There is also a Sabacc: Bounty Hunt variant included in the rules, which is similar to Go Fish for younger children.<br/><br/>",

The game uses wrestlers' repertoires of moves to flow from offense to defense and finally to pin and submission attempts. A pair of dice, the unique wrestler and result cards are all you need to recreate all the action of Pro Wrestling right on your table top!<br/><br/>The game comes with complete rules, cards, game box and dice. It is easy to learn and you can play an 8 match card in less then an hour.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Open Rails Origins - 18AL is a hybrid of several game systems, most notable 18XX, Age of Steam and Chicago Express as well as some other unique twists to create a compact yet challenging train game experience.<br/><br/>Play begins with players participating in an auction to buy shares in one of five railroads represented in 19th century historic Alabama.  Cubes are used to lay track, represent engines you have acquired and to track your income and stock price.   The price you set on your initial stock purchase determines how many cubes you have to work with.  Railroads may build stations to block a rival's advances, upgrade cities.  Each turn your railroad may decide to save money to buy further locomotive upgrades to force your competitors to buy more expensive trains that they can't afford - or they can pay out to their investors to ultimately drive up stock price.  Play moves fast and fortunes can change in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>The object is to make more money than your fellow robber barons by holding the most valuable stocks and acquiring the most cash through deliveries through the game.<br/><br/>The game is playable for one to three players.  The one player version takes about 20 minutes to play after the initial pass through the rules.  Experienced players should be able to get through the two and three player versions of the game in 60-90 minutes.<br/><br/>This game is a print and play release of the Open Rails train game system.  Poker chips, 1 cm cubes or smaller, a pair of scissors and the means to print out four sheets of 8 x 10 paper are all that are needed to play.<br/><br/>Latest files - including Sampo's redraw available offsite here:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7AWw2_0pF5DM3pNSHRrNlVNOHM&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7AWw2_0pF5DM3pNSHRr...</a>;usp=sharing<br/><br/>",

Your ultimate ambition is to receive a Royal commission to create something for the looming wedding of the young Prince and his fianc&eacute; &ndash; however, this cannot happen unless you first build up a good reputation! Unfortunately, Shearspike (your fellow pupil and fiercest rival) has also just completed his apprenticeship and has similar ideas. You cannot deny that Shearspike has more natural talent and skill than you do, but you are determined and hard-working, whereas Shearspike is lazy and arrogant. Your time is short and reputation is everything in this game!<br/><br/>There are just 4 sheets to print (grayscale) - two sheets are your player boards, two sheets contain 18 cards that require cutting.<br/>You will also need to supply 7 dice and approx 30 cubes or tokens of any colour.<br/><br/>This was an entry into the 2016 Solitaire PNP Design Contest:-<br/>3rd Place - 'Best Overall Design'<br/>Winner - 'Best Worker Placement Game'<br/>Winner - 'Best Greyscale Printed Game'<br/>3rd Place - 'Best Easy to Build Game'<br/>3rd Place - 'Best Original Artwork'<br/>4th Place - 'Best Graphic Design'<br/><br/>",

You will use a single word (not in English!) to describe your actions or intentions on steering this ship to survival.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>Starship Babel is a microgame in which players which speak different languages desperately try to steer a spaceship to safety.<br/><br/>The game consists of a spaceship card and 8 sector cards, numbered 5-12. One of these is flipped open, showing a dictionary of an alien language. The other cards are placed in a row, with the spaceship card between two other cards.<br/><br/>The players now discuss their plan, using only the words on the dictionary card. Afterwards, they simultaneously lift 1-5 fingers. If the overall number of fingers matches the number of the sector card before the ship, they advance by one position. If not, the last card of the row is removed. The ship escapes to safety when it reaches the front of the row and is destroyed when there are no cards behind it.<br/><br/>",

You will cruise, groove, and unwind across town, trying to vibe with them to prove you're the coolest in the crew. Do you have the energy to keep up with everyone else who has their eyes on the crown?<br/><br/>In the quick and clever card game DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince: Summertime, which is inspired by the classic hit song, players have to outwit each other with a series of tricky decisions. First, reveal a &quot;spot&quot; card &mdash; something like a block party, car show, or family reunion &mdash; each with one of five different vibes. Players then pick an action card, an energy card, and potentially a boost card to play all at once. Actions can give you boosts and cancel your opponents'. Energy cards have a variety of values and give you boosts if they match the spot's vibe, but you can use each energy card only once!<br/><br/>Once players have taken their actions, and energy has been counted, whoever has the most wins the spot! Spots are worth points on their own, but are worth extra points if they are collected as a set, or match a player's personal vibe.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Inside this container are twenty wooden discs, two each of ten colors, and you can see these discs inside the thicket through 29 cut-out slots. However, the thicket is designed so that five of the discs will fall into grooves at the bottom of the vertical container, and the discs in these grooves will be hidden by a piece of cardboard underbrush so that they are not visible until you remove the underbrush during play. Ten animals in the colors of the discs are set up in the center of the playing area within reach of all players. Each player also has a stack of nine tiles that when placed together form a picture.<br/><br/>Each round, one player shakes the thicket face down so that no one can see which discs are going where, then they stand the thicket upright on the table. Everyone then grabs for the animals that they think are hiding in the underbrush, that is, the animals that can be seen only once through the cut-out slots &mdash; or possibly not seen at all.<br/><br/>Once everyone has grabbed all the animals that they wish to, remove the underbrush to see which animals are actually there. If you grabbed an animal that is in the underbrush, reveal one of your picture tiles, and if that animal is in the underbrush twice, reveal two picture tiles instead. If by mistake you grabbed an animal that is not in the underbrush, you must return a picture tile to the bottom of your stack. Keep playing rounds until one or more players have revealed all of their tiles, completed their picture, and won.<br/><br/>",

The Story of &quot;HAM-FARM&quot;】<br/>As an owner hamster, you are in charge of &quot;running a company by hamsters for hamsters&quot;.<br/>You scout for new hamsters from the &quot;ham farm,&quot; a recreation area on the outskirts of the company, and sometimes build useful facilities in order to create the &quot;best company for hamsters!<br/>Hamsters have &quot;effect icons&quot; and &quot;scores,&quot; and the player with the highest total score wins. However, hamsters with lower &quot;score&quot; are easier to scout and have stronger &quot;effect icons&quot;. Players should also actively target &quot;facility cards&quot; that have a lasting effect!<br/>Players can strengthen their decks with cards that have strong &quot;effect icons,&quot; or they can aim for cards with high &quot;score,&quot; or they can aim for bonuses by building lots of &quot;facilities.<br/>The interesting point is that each player's strategy is unique!<br/><br/>【Anyone can immediately enjoy the fun of deck building!】<br/>While condensing the fun of a card game in which players can make &quot;combos&quot; and make full use of &quot;permanent effects,&quot; the rules have been adjusted so that children can enjoy playing with other children and with their parents. The game is language-independent and can be enjoyed as soon as the five basic icons are understood!<br/>Each player's turn is short and fast-paced, and the 154 all-unique cards change the situation each time, making the game highly replayable.<br/>The game can be played by 2 to 5 players and supports solo play, making it a game that can be enjoyed with anyone at any time!<br/><br/>",

Earth's resources we're devastated, but technology brought about through the war enable humanity to reach the Moon where they discovered Element X, which when refined provides ample energy.<br/><br/>Mining on the Moon was rough work for the men and women there.  Fatalities were high and the Miners wanted better living standards, but were refused.  They soon formed a faction calling themselves the Lunar Colonists and drove off anyone that stood against them.<br/><br/>With Earth's new energy source under an embargo, the greatest nations of the time formed an alliance in a last ditch effort to take back their mine-bases against the rebel miners now calling themselves the Lunar Colonists.<br/><br/>This is where the game begins.  The Lunar Colonists, owning all 30 of the Mine-bases, have converted mining equipment and even robots to help in their fight.<br/><br/>The Earth Forces, comprising of the United States, USSR, and Republic of China, have landed troops on the Moon to reclaim the bases, but with resources low they have only 6 Turns in which to complete their mission.<br/><br/>If they can reclaim at least 16 of the 30 Mine-bases the Lunar Colonists must forfeit their hold on the Moon, but if they don't succeed then Earth must recognize the Moon and the Colonists as a free State.<br/><br/>",

The impulse engines of Val Jean were originally built in 2332.<br/><br/>In 2371, while under the command of Chakotay, the Val Jean was pursued by the Cardassian warship Vetar, Gul Evek's flagship. Chakotay ordered the ship into the Badlands to try to escape the Cardassians.<br/><br/>After eluding pursuit, the Val Jean was scanned by a coherent tetryon beam and transported into the Delta Quadrant by the Caretaker. Once there, the crew was abducted and subjected to medical tests to determine their biological compatibility with the Caretaker. One of the crew, chief engineer B'Elanna Torres, was removed from the others and sent to the surface of the Ocampa homeworld.<br/><br/>In order to recover his missing crew member, Chakotay reluctantly joined forces with Starfleet captain Kathryn Janeway of the USS Voyager, who had been sent to capture him but had instead been pulled into the Delta Quadrant as well. The cooperation proved successful, and both Torres and Voyager crew member Harry Kim were rescued.<br/><br/>This expansion adds a new ship and a new set of cards to Star Trek: Attack Wing.<br/><br/>",
