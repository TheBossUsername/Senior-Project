Up to six players each decide on a church name and draw their first two leaders to add to their church of twenty members and a very small budget.<br/><br/>As the game progresses each church looks to increase their 'Holiness', 'Theology' and 'Holy Spirit' points through preaching different topics from the 'Preaching Track' (each of which give different variations of point provision - for example preaching on Biblical Truth gives +3TH while preaching on Serving allows an extra leader to be drawn next turn). Points can also be gained from buying equipment and events (buying Original Greek New Testaments gives a Theology bonus each turn for example).<br/>These equipment and events can also be used to increase the size of the church (Church barbecues, Harvest Festivals, Bible Weeks etc)or to make your current members happier (doughnuts, china cups, quality tea, comfy chairs).<br/><br/>Make sure the church can afford to pay the rent of the pub meeting room it is meeting in and look for bigger and better buildings to rent and buy that are on the market!<br/><br/>However church life isn't always fun and roses, watch out for the potentially damaging &quot;Event Cards&quot;. Some good, some bad, some indifferent, but all a talking point, as the churches look to grow, compete or work together in a game trying to balance between dry wit, in-jokes and a business simulation.<br/><br/>But which church is the most rounded and most developed by the time all the world's people groups have been reached?<br/><br/>",

There are four craters in the surface, one for each player.  The center is dominated by a plastic rocket which locks into the gameboard mechanism, effectively creating a platform beneath each crater.<br/><br/>Each player starts with the full complement of five plastic astronauts of their selected color.  Players place one of their astronauts on the platform in the nearest crater.<br/><br/>A marble is spun around the rim of the circular gameboard; when it loses velocity it drops into one of a series of colored depressions which circle the board just inside the marble track.  The player controlling the astronauts corresponding to the colored depression that the marble stops in must quickly grab the central rocket &amp; remove it from the board.  This causes the platforms beneath the craters to move aside and the astronauts to fall through the board. Players must attempt to catch their astronauts before they fall.<br/><br/>Any astronauts that fall through the board are given to the player who removed the rocket.  The winner is the first player to get ten astronauts.<br/><br/>Interesting game in that four (and only four) players are required.<br/><br/>",

The players no longer need to depend on luck to win the game but rather on their intellectual prowess.  The game includes 3 stocks, each having 6 quarterly earning cards and 3 quarterly dividend cards. <br/> The game starts with disclosure of each stock's 3 quarterly earning cards and 1 quarterly dividend cards. Therefore, during the game the players need to sum up the three quarterly earnings and calculate the probabilities of the fourth quarterly earning in order to estimate this year's annual earning, and further the year-end target prices. With comparisons of the current stock prices, the players can conclude if the stock is over-valued or under-valued.  There are also day-to-day return-on-equities and risks due to the fluctuation of each stock. The game provides players the opportunities to play as day-traders or long-run investors, or both. This game teaches players the portfolio management skills and how to make correct strategic investment decisions on the stock market.<br/><br/>",

Gordon &amp; Mike Kowalski) contains a native legend about the origin of the beaver, historical background information about the Indian tribes of the Pacific Northwest, a list of related reading suggestions, and a history of the Beaver Tooth game.<br/><br/>For two or more players, aged 6 and up. $19.95; from the Skookum Jump Rope Co., Box 1159, Port Townsend, WA 98368; (800) 255-9526; fax (360) 379-9049.<br/><br/>Authentic good fun.<br/><br/>Partial proceeds help support the United Indians of All Tribes Foundation.<br/><br/>",

Of course, your rivals will all be doing the same!<br/><br/>A description of the game itself:<br/><br/>Each player controls a squad of four Chase-Bots. The object is to get your robots into the starting spaces of your opponents. Game play is in three phases.<br/><br/>1.    The Programming Phase<br/>2.    The Reveal Phase<br/>3.    The Movement Phase<br/><br/>In the Programming Phase, each player selects one card from their hand and places it face down in front of them.<br/><br/>In the Reveal Phase players simultaneously turn their cards over. Turn order for each round is determined by the values of the cards.<br/><br/>In the Movement Phase, each player moves his Chase-bots in turn.<br/><br/>The last player to move one of his Chase-bots into the main play area is the first to be IT. He must capture another Chase-bot with the black IT robot before he can move his own Chase-bots again. This makes one of the other players IT.<br/><br/>Throughout the game players will be installing, stealing and interfering with each other&rsquo;s Upgrades. Upgrades give each player additional abilities such as alternative ways of moving their robots, increasing their hand size and any of up to 30 special powers.<br/><br/>Special Trigger cards add to the excitement as players wrest turn order from each other, steal upgrades from one another and basically sabotage their opponents.<br/><br/>Playground tag was never quite like this!<br/><br/>",

Each player has a Duke, represented by a one-square obelisk. With Parliament and the Dukes placed on the board, players alternate turns in placing wooden blocks representing buildings in the city on the board. The objects are to capture the opposing Duke, capture territory, and capture buildings. Parliament, when captured, can be relocated to any available area on the board. Capturing the opposing Duke wins the game immediately. If neither Duke is captured, when no more buildings may be legally played the player capturing the most territory wins.<br/><br/>The publisher also included rules for a solitaire version.<br/><br/>According to the designer, fewer than 100 copies were produced.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Planetenspiel&quot; or &quot;Planets Game&quot;<br/><br/>In a galaxy far far away, 7 suns are orbited by 2 planets each. These planets are home to the Plonx and the Quirx, who both feel they are the better tribe. The more common galactic option to prove superiority, open warfare, has been abandoned. Instead both tribes go head to head in an annual contest, using their ability to manipulate the speed with which their tribe's planets turn around the suns. The tribe that is most skillful at manipulating the planets in such a way that it manages to establish contact between tribe-members on neighboring planets most often, wins the tournament and gains the brag rights for that year.<br/> This is a highly abstract space game for 2 players that is a slight step away for a designer that is better known as a safe pair of hands for decent children's and family games. Manfred Ludwig shows here he can be equally at home with challenging the more abstract gamer as within its simplicity lies an engaging little dice less strategy game that isn't spectacular, but works surprisingly well.<br/><br/>The board shows a large sun on each corner of a hexagonal, and a seventh sun right in the middle of it. Another 3 lines are drawn that divide the hexagonal in 6 equal pizza slices. Then 6 planets are placed at equal distance in circular orbits around each sun, in such a way that the planets closest to a foreign sun are directly facing a planet of that sun. These are the possible meeting points.<br/><br/>Each player get 5 contact chips and places one tribe planet around each sun on the prescribed starting places. Then, in turn, each player moves one own planet. When a player ends a move by making &quot;contact&quot; with another planet of the own tribe, that player  claims one contact-chip of the opponent. The first player to own all chips wins the tournament.<br/><br/>Movement follows a strict pattern. Each player can only move one (own) planet each turn. The first player moves a planet exactly one space clockwise, the other player gets to move two spaces. Then moves of three, four and five spaces follow, and when a player has moved five spaces, the whole sequence gets repeated, starting with one. Planets can overtake each other, but moves that would result in planets landing on each other are blocked and force a player to move one of the other planets instead. In the rare cases that a player cannot move any own planets, the opponent gets to move instead.<br/><br/>Publishing history: this abstract game appeared in the German game magazine P&ouml;ppel-Revue (1987/2 April-MAY) as that edition's &quot;Das Spiel im Heft&quot;. A pull-out board and rules were provided, players still needed to supply their own pieces (2x7 pawns and 10 contact-chips).<br/><br/>",

Like the excellent original, which was developed to instruct young people in the important fundamentals of baseball, this version may also be played alone or with others.<br/><br/>No one has to tell a serious player that a MENTAL MISTAKE can often make the difference between winning and losing a ballgame.  It is for this reason that college and high school students - as well as the recognized professionals - are required to read and memorize play books and study sheets.  They are aware that such activity is just as important to becoming a good ballplayer as knowing how to hit the ball and run the bases.<br/><br/>Fielder's Option is different because it puts the &quot;fun&quot; into it.  It generates a sense of competition, which is what baseball is all about.  And when you play Fielder's Option you have the opportunity to learn not only what is requested of you when playing your &quot;favorite&quot; position, but all the other positions as well.<br/><br/>Pete Rose has recommended it.  The creators of Fielder's Option are grateful, for we know there is no better example of a player always being mentally prepared than Pete Rose.<br/><br/>",

A Game-turn proceeds as follows:<br/><br/>First, up to 10 minutes per turn are allocated for negotiation among the players. <br/>Then the first player receives Resource Factors (RFs) and deploys them. The number of RFs each player receives is specified in the Scenario Instructions. <br/>The player then conducts attacks against other players' RFs. This completes the player's turn. <br/>The remaining players receive RFs, deploy RFs, and then make attacks with their RFs in the sequence given in the Scenario Instructions. <br/>When all of the players have taken their turns, one Game-turn has been completed. <br/>Each game lasts for a specified number of Game-turns. The game is over after all of these have been completed.

        "description": "Triapon<br/><br/>This abstract game is played on a triangular board with 45 holes (the longest row has 9 holes, the tip has one). It can only be played by 3 players exactly, and is, in essence, &quot;Nine Men's Morris&quot; for three.<br/><br/>Each player gets 9 playing pieces and play starts with placement of these pieces onto the board. Clockwise, each player places a piece onto a free space until all pieces are on the board. From then on, in each turn, a player must move one marble to an immediately neighboring empty space. When this result in one or more &quot;Triads&quot; (three uninterrupted marbles of that player's color in a straight line), then that player removes an unprotected marble from one opponent. Extending an existing Triad does not count as creating a new one. The first player who reduced both opponents to 2 marbles each, is the winner.<br/><br/>The designer has come up with a rules set that makes great use of the nature of a triangular grid, making Triapon a  much cleverer strategic game than a simple connect-3 on a triangle. A careful observer will notice that, besides the obvious Triad that is made on neighboring rows, there are two other straight lines along which Triads can be formed. If a &quot;short Triad&quot; uses 3 neighboring rows, a &quot;medium Triad&quot; uses holes that lay one row removed from each other, and a &quot;long Triad&quot; even has gaps of 2 rows between the marbles.<br/><br/>Pieces get taken first from the opponent who has the most marbles left on board, and only vulnerable marbles can be removed. These are pieces that don't form part of any Triad, are in a Triad that gets crossed by a longer Triad, or are part of an extended Triad, but, when removed, leave the other marbles still in a Triad.<br/><br/>And in the Nine Men's Morris tradition: when a player is reduced to just 3 pieces, that player gains the option to move a marble to any free space. The moment that a player has only 2 pieces left, that player is eliminated.<br/><br/>This is, in broad lines, how standard Triapon is played. An entertaining variation in which blocking marbles are brought back onto the board is also included.<br/><br/>Publishing history: released in 2 versions by the Swiss &quot;Murmel Spielwerkstatt und Verlag&quot; in 1999. The packing is as clever as the game itself: the board edges flap up to form a pyramid shaped box, neatly holding all the pieces. The deluxe board, or &quot;Triapon Classic&quot;, is made of 8-layer plywood and comes with 30 glass marbles  (10 in 3 colors) in a pouch. The cheaper version is made of cardboard, has a picture of a famous Swiss Alp printed on the outside, and is hence known as the &quot;Triapon Matterhorn&quot; edition.<br/><br/>",

A face-down person (Mr. Aay, Mr. Bee, Mr. Cee, Mr. Dee) and a face-down weapon (hammer, gun, knife, poison) are laid about on the board, and each player gets 2 cards, one showing which person to find, and one showing which weapon to find.  Players spin the spinner to move around the board, looking at the face-down pieces in each area until they find the 2 on their cards.  They then return to the center, reveal their cards, and tell the other players where their weapon and person are on the board.  If they succeed, they win!  If they declare wrong they are eliminated.<br/><br/>",

Then it is a matter of setting up the other colorful bits such as the starting stalls, the finishing post and of course the five lovely plastic horses complete with weighted swinging jockeys.<br/><br/>Players then present their stall cards to get their starting places and have an opportunity to bet on who they think will hit the finish line first.<br/><br/>From here it is a matter of turning a crank at the starting line which causes the track to vibrate under the horses propelling them slowly forward, until a winner emerges.<br/><br/>As far as I can determine this seems entirely random (although the weighted jockeys seem to behave differently each time). Though the game would be a great beer and pretzels action affair or for those loving horse racing. Due to the random nature and betting I wouldn't really recommend for youngsters.<br/><br/>",

These can range from announcing, &quot;I am stupid&quot; before taking a drink, to revealing one of your most embarrassing moments, to acting as servant to all of the other players by refilling their drinks, and even making up your own rule as the &quot;Rule Master.&quot; Oh yeah, be weary of the Prison and Hospital spaces, however, you can gain relief by hiding out in the &quot;Safety Zone&quot;.<br/><br/>Contents: One party board, 100 Action cards, 60 Letter cards, two die, and six tokens.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The game of Chandal Mandal&quot;<br/><br/>A variation of Chaupar, the national game of India. Chaupar later became Parcheesi - aka Ludo - in the west. Invented by Akbar the Great, ruler of India, who lived from 1542 to 1605.<br/><br/>Think of it as 16 player Chaupar, with 16 arms instead of 4, and you are a long way there. The board is made out of 16 parallelograms arranged in a circle around a centre. Each parallelogram is divided in 24 fields, in 3 rows of 8. Each of the 16 players get 4 pawns each. Four (traditional) dice are used, with the longer sides marked 1,2,10 and 12. As in Chaupar, the pieces are moved anti-clockwise, and go around the whole circle. The first player out wins the agreed amount from all other 15, and each subsequent finisher also gets that same amount from whoever is still left to finish. So the last player loses the most.<br/><br/>His Majesty seemed to play 12 broad variations:<br/><br/>1. No pawn can remove another pawn, but it moves on by itself instead.<br/>2. Single pawns may be captured, and are sent back to start.<br/>3. With each throw two pawns are moved at a time (with or without the option to capture).<br/>4. Three or four pawns are moved like this.<br/>5. The dice are thrown four times, and four pawns are moved at each throw.<br/>   <br/>Usually players would all move in the same direction, but sometimes some players would move anti-clockwise, whilst other would play clockwise.<br/><br/>6. A player is out when he reaches the starting point of the player directly opposite, moving from the middle row of his opposite number into the empty centre space. Longer games would require players to reach the starting point of the player sitting on the left.<br/>7. Each player has three throws. On the first throw two own pawns are moved, on the second throw, the player moves one own pawn, and one pawn belonging to the player on the right. On the third throw, again, one own pawn gets moved, plus the player on the left may also move one pawn belonging to that player. Pawns belonging to neighbours cannot be removed, and when they land in the same row as a player's own pieces, they are moved as if they belonged to the throwing player.<br/>8. Two pawns together may hit two other pawns, but single pawns cannot hit each other.<br/>9. Four pawns combined can remove 3 pawns, 3 pawns can hit groups of 2, 2 can hit single pawns, but single pieces cannot remove any.<br/>10. A player whose turn it is moves according to the dice rolled, the player opposite him moves at the same time, but uses the eyes of the bottom side of the dice, whilst the players on the left and right also move, but according to the eyes on the left and right face of the rolled die.<br/>11. Five dice are rolled. The active player moves the sum of the two highest rolls. The next highest roll is used by the person on the opposite side of the board. The lowest two rolls are used by the players sitting on the left and right.<br/>12. Five dice and five pawns. At every throw, the result of one of the rolled dice is given to the player on the right. In a variation to this, the thrower would name four players before rolling, and would give one result to each of these players, keeping only the fifth die. And when only a few points are left to get pukhtah, the remaining points go to those near to where the dice come to rest.<br/><br/>If the game was played by less people the board and the number of dice thrown would be amended accordingly. It is highly likely the boards were frequently life-sized and groups of slave girls were sent around the track, dressed in appropriate colours.<br/><br/>Brief history: ask anyone to name great rulers of history and you are unlikely to hear the name Akbar, ruler of the Mughal Empire (1556-1605). Leaving remarkable military and administrative successes, and a fondness for alcohol and women to one side, the illiterate and, at times, brutal man, also had a passion for religious tolerance and class harmony. He surrounded himself with scholars, thinkers and poets, and was persuaded by the Plato school that argued that a great ruler should be like a philosopher-king. Whilst trying to unify the different religions, he became a great patron of the arts and literature, for which he is best remembered. Thanks to the recordings in the &quot;Ain I Akabari&quot;, third volume of the &quot;Akbarnāma&quot;, a detailed biography and history record kept by his close advisor and court scribe, Abu'l Fazl, we know that the good bloke also had a weak spot for games, and had even invented a game of his own. It is because of Abu'l Fazl passion for detail and accuracy that the rules of this elaborate Chaupar descendant have been preserved to this day, as part of a seperate chapter on Amusements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BUG WORLD is a game in which the players control a team of ants. Three worker ants and one soldier.  Each team leaves the safety of your nest in search of different types of food. You roam throughout the garden, seeking under leaf and twig for the next morsel... but look out! Around the next corner could be an even hungrier praying mantis, trap door spider, assassin bug or other nasty predator, which you need to fight off to survive. Figure out where your paticular type of food is hidden and get them back to your nest first, and you can become king of the Bug World! Game includes a large folding game board, 1 die, 12 worker ant pieces, 4 solider ant pieces, 20 bug playing pieces, an insect glossary with cool bug facts and playing instructions.<br/><br/>Ages 9 and up.<br/><br/>",

Players try to get rid of cards in their hands by playing cards that fit the mathematical conditions at the time. The game comes with a deck of 39 cards and two special six-sided dice (the dice show 1,1,2,3,+ and -).<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/><br/><br/>Object of the GameTo be the Greatest, just be the first to discard all your Maths Me! cards! To do this, players place them in turn in a centre discard-pile according to the 'condition' of the play at the time.<br/><br/>One pack of Maths Me! cards is just right for 2-4 players. For more than 4 players, just add another pack!<br/><br/>Game Structure<br/><br/>Maths Me! is a mathematical symbol game that revolves around placing valid cards according to one of the 2 prevailing conditions, &quot;Greater Than&quot; or &quot;Less Than&quot;. The prevailing condition refers to the current flow of the game. During &quot;Greater Than&quot;, players must place cards which continually increase the numerical value being played (e.g. 47, 63, 89, 92 ...). On the other hand, when the prevailing condition is &quot;Less Than&quot;, numbers must become smaller and smaller. <br/><br/>The game came with a sticker indicating the National Parenting Center Seal of Approval 1997 (The Camelot Hobbies website gives the year for the seal of approval as 1996).<br/><br/>URL for Camelot Hobbies website: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.camelot.com.sg/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.camelot.com.sg/</a><br/><br/>",

On one side there is a version of Snakes and Ladders called Blue Ribbon Pooch in which players use dogs as tokens, and use two numerical dice and one operations dice to add or subtract before moving their token. Hence, players must perform the required mathematical operations in order to move their token.<br/><br/>On the other side of the board is Lucky Puppy, in which all players begin in the dog pound and work their way around the board to find a home. There are four special places on the board, where players may improve or hamper their progress by completing a task. When a player lands on one of these spaces, however, all players get a chance at receiving the bonus or penalty: they complete to answer the math question posed by the roll of the dice. A player must complete all the tasks to get a home. Dice are used in the same way as in Blue Ribbon Pooch. The graphics on the game board depict various situations in which a child might interact with a dog.<br/><br/>This is a children's game designed to develop math skills.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A set of medium to large scale wargames rules for the American Civil War period 1861 to 1865.<br/><br/>Units are organized into Brigades and commanded at Divisional level for the Confederation and at Corp level for the Union.<br/><br/>A very simple command ordering system allows a fast flowing game to unfold right before your eyes. This is achieved through a command structure where commanders must keep their troops motivated or their formation and army morale may crumble. Control of the battle is achieved through a series of morale checks; these are effortless and give extremely good historical results. You may find your units running for cover when you least desire it, then find that they return with a new resolve and vigor for the fight.<br/><br/>These rules are capable of reproducing all the major battles of the American Civil War from Bull Run 21st July 1861 through to Parnetto Ranche 13th May 1865.<br/><br/>",

Players alternately drop one of their twenty &quot;Goola&quot; beads into one of the five slots in the Goola Tower trying to form a line of 4 or 5 beads of their color in order to accumulate points (1 point for a line of 4 and 2 points for a line of 5).  The twist here is that scoring only happens after all the beads are placed.  After the initial placement, each player then alternately operate one of the five mechanic valves at the bottom of the tower under each slot to make the beads drop one by one out the bottom of the tower.  After each bead drops out, each player count all the points they get for forming lines of 4 or 5 beads of the same color. The player with the higher points scores the difference in points on the scoreboard.  The first player to reach 8 points on the scoreboard wins.  A further twist can be found in the blind-play option built in the Goola Tower.  This advance play is similar to the basic game except that the bead placement is shielded from the players' sight, and the players must reply on memory to calculate where to place their beads.  After all the beads are played, the lock mechanism is released allowing the beads to drop into sight and the game continues as normal.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>40 Goola beads in two colors<br/>1 Goola tower<br/>1 Tower base with scoreboard<br/>2 Goola stickers<br/>1 Rulebook<br/><br/>",

If no one needs the card picked, it is turned face down again and the child to the left of the last player is the next to go.<br/><br/>The play continues around the group until one child has all the sections of his board covered with the matching cards and is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Before playing a new game the boards are interchanged among the players.<br/><br/>",

Version &quot;B&quot; uses basic visual and memory skills as players enjoy traditional Bingo on a grid featuring 24 constellations.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVersion A:<br/><br/>There are 30 large glossy cards, each featuring a constellation with numbered, colored stars (that glow in the dark!). Each player selects one. Colored and numbered stars are selected from the bag and called -- first to complete his constellation wins.<br/><br/>Version B:<br/><br/>On the flip side of the constellation cards is a traditional Bingo grid of constellations. Constellations are selected from a deck (each has information about that constellation on the back). First to complete five in a row wins.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThe constellation cards feature glow in the dark stars and an orienting arrow.

        "description": "Players begin with 4,000 dollars and have the chance to make a fortune or go broke by investing in farms and farm related businesses. A property can be purchased only by landing on it and each time a player must decide whether to invest his limited funds or to hope for something better among the 28 farms and 9 businesses available along the track. Cheaper properties are easier to develop but have a smaller payoff when landed on by an opponent. (just like Monopoly). Another decision must be made regarding the 3 different kinds of crops that may be planted on each farm. Again cheaper pays off sooner but in smaller amounts. Once the crop is in a player can add farm equipment in the form of plastic &quot;silo sections&quot; which are piled in strict color sequence. Limited quantities of the best crops and the highest silo section adds to the decision making process. A player may mortgage a property to pay debt or to make other investments and can still collect 10% of his normal fee from a visiting opponent. Other features include taxes, becoming incorporated, luck cards which can be disastrous, selling properties to an opponent or the treasury.<br/><br/>",

Twelve of the tiles have stars at one end and are &quot;wild&quot;. 2 to 4 players play, each using a rack of 6 tiles. Tiles can be placed anywhere in the layout provided that they match the same symbol in opposite color of at least one face that has been previously played. Notches on the tiles help keep the layout securely in place. The score for a play depends on the number of matches which, in rare cases, can be as many as 6. If a player can make a match on at least one face of his tile he may play a second or third and so on up to all 6 tiles from his hand. Play ends when, after all the tiles have been drawn a player clears his rack, earning a bonus. High score wins<br/><br/>",

Object of the game is to move 2 of the 4 pieces on the opposing side of the board.<br/><br/>The name of the game comes from the moving mechanism of the playing pieces: they can move 1 field in all 4 directions, but they are flipped over every time when they move (I guess they &quot;flop&quot; when moving to the left or right side).<br/><br/>All playing pieces are numbered from 1-4 on one side and from 5-8 on the other side. Since the pieces are always flipped over, the value of the pieces is changing with every move and it needs much thinking in advance to find the best moves.<br/><br/>Another problem is, that the pieces should always look in the same direction. To assure this, each piece has 2 dots on the front and 2 on the back, but when comparing the pieces on the game-box with the ones included with this game, it is obvious, that this designing problem is not solved very well.<br/><br/>",

This was a time where the local Britons were beleaguered by waves of settlers from Ireland, Scotland, Scandinavia, and the European mainland. These settlers fought the Britons and one another in an attempt to establish permanent kingdoms. It was a time of economic breakdown, when the Roman coinage was replaced with a system of barter, and also a time of spiritual confusion, with the Christian church coming to dominance in an age of superstition and violence.<br/><br/>In Saxon Shore, two to five players struggle to become the dominant kingdom of the British Isles. A player can win by fulfilling one of several victory conditions:<br/><br/>1. Eliminate all other players.<br/>2. Build four cities.<br/>3. Control eight provinces producing resources.<br/>4. Control any ten provinces.<br/><br/>",

A strange fact &mdash; no matter how you connect the paths, the number of separate groups will always equal the number of closed loops formed. The laser-cut, hand-inlaid acrylic tiles are framed so the 14&quot; set can be displayed on its easel as an ever-changing work of art.<br/><br/>",

Two to four (as two teams) players work the puzzle on their side of the square sheet for three minutes, each with their own colored pencil.  When time is up, the sheet is rotated 90 degrees, the timer is reset, and the players work the new (to them) puzzle now on their side.<br/>  <br/>You keep adding letters and/or correcting mistakes, then rotating every three minutes until the puzzles are completed or everyone gives up.  You get points for correct letters you've added, and you subtract points for errors noted by your opponents.  The colored pencils allow end-of-game scoring and adjudication of the puzzles.  Answers are provided in sealed envelopes.<br/><br/>Seems like it would be fun, but you'd really have to love crosswords - working them with time pressure is sweet misery.  Six games can be played by four players with the supplied puzzles.  Refill puzzles were available in 1985 using the handy order form, but good luck now.<br/><br/>",

From their website:<br/><br/>Flickers!, the movie trivia game that leaves nothing to chance!<br/><br/>Flickers (slang):  a motion picture.<br/><br/>That explains the name of the game. But why do we call it the movie trivia game that leaves nothing to chance? Because in this game,  the element of chance has been eliminated.  There are no traditional dice to indicate space moves on aboard; there are no exact number requirements to win the game and there are no free rolls of a dice.<br/><br/>The only playing piece is a color-coded cube corresponding to movie categories.<br/><br/>Flickers! is scored, and won, solely on your knowledge of the movies.  You score points (or lose them) based on what you know about the movies, from home-grown fare to foreign treats, from the 1930s to the present.<br/><br/>Flickers! has been created and designed to be fun for the casual once-a-month movie goer as well as challenging enough for the avid movie-a-week film buff.<br/><br/>Flickers! can be played by any number of adult players, anytime, anywhere.  It can be played by individuals, or in teams. It can be played at the dining-room table,  in the park, or in the back seat  of a car on a road trip.<br/><br/>And if any of the question and answer cards pique your curiosity, go out and rent the movie. You may have no idea what delights you are missing when you don't explore all the genres from all the decades, and the works of stars past and present.<br/><br/>Above all, enjoy.....the movies and Flickers!<br/><br/>",

A dart gun with three suction-cup darts is also included.<br/><br/>A turn consists of firing all three darts at the scarecrow from a pre-agreed distance. If a player causes the coat of the scarecrow to fall off, 50 points is scored and their turn ends, regardless of the number of darts in reserve.<br/><br/>The first player to accumulate 300 points is the winner.<br/><br/>Game was re-released in 1975 in a very slightly different box.<br/><br/>",

Each of the players has 6 playing pieces, which move like the Knights in chess. In the middle of the board is one neutral piece, who carries a wooden ball on his crater shaped top.<br/><br/>Object of the game is to catch that wooden ball (the playing pieces all have small craters on their top to put the ball on top) and bring it to your edge of the 9x9 game board. The neutral piece moves like the king in chess and it can make captures by jumping on other pieces - like in &quot;Trap the Cap&quot;. What makes the game interesting is, that the neutral piece is the only piece that can capture normal pieces. That means, that you need at least 1 piece to capture the ball, but the other pieces can only try to block other pieces from doing so.<br/><br/>",

Each tile can be moved 1 space in advance. Captures (accomplished sideways) can be done when a tile can move to an empty space, which has an opponents tile directly adjacent to it. Since the tiles are facing in 2 directions, the rules use the term &quot;overshadowed&quot; for such tiles. The capture is done by tipping over the captured piece and if there are additional tiles directly behind the captured piece, you can tip over these tiles also.<br/><br/>The game ends, when all positions are blocked, that is when no reasonable moves can be made by neither player. You simply count the tiles then to see, if the water or land player has won the game.<br/><br/>",

Players field ball, run with it, throw to basemen who cover bags!  You move batter, runners!  Baseball know-how, strategy, luck!  Fast-moving -- takes about 1/2 hour!  Based on 2000 big league games!  Scores just like in the majors!  Sturdy board, 18 men, ball!<br/><br/>Basically, a spinner (1 to 6) is spun three times.  The results of these spins determine the play -- a first spin &quot;1&quot; is a walk or a strikeout.  Once the ball is in play and the location has been determined, the defensive player moves the fielders to the ball before arrows push the ball past.

        "description": "As the rules put it &quot;The object o' Sea Rats! is to be the last pirate afloat&quot;.<br/><br/>Each player starts with one ship, six cannonballs, and six crates of supplies used to repair damage. The ships are positioned on a sea map board that can be rolled up for storage. Each ship starts at a different port. Cargo can be gained or lost by moving to ports, fighting other ships, and bribing, extorting, or trading with other pirates.<br/><br/>Dice rolls determine which port you can stock up at next, how much cargo you load, how far you move, and whether your cannonballs hit the ship you aim at. You may also attempt to take &quot;The Treasure&quot; which may be used as a bribe that can't be refused, to buy an extra die for movement, or to buy an extra cargo die with the ability to overload your ship. Possession, not expenditure, of the treasure allows docking at any port.<br/><br/>A ship hit with more cannonballs than it has crates sinks to Davy Jones' Locker, and the losing captain is out of the game. The victorious captain may expend his own crates to keep the ship from sinking and control an additional ship himself, or allow the previous captain to stay on in a subservient role and continue to play the ship if &quot;he/she swears an oath o' allegiance&quot;. This can be used in many cases to keep all players involved in the game to the end.<br/><br/>From the Publisher:<br/><br/>AVAST YE!<br/> Welcome te Sea Rats!&trade;, the most excitin' pirate board game this side o' the Ivory Coast. Where old salts and landlubbers alike sail ships on the high seas, battle with their enemies, stock up at ports o' call, an', best of all, steal The Treasure&mdash;Arrrghhh!<br/><br/>Send yer buddies down te Davy Jones' Locker. Capture &quot;the prize&quot; an' build up a fleet o' ships! Bribe yer enemies te escape hostile fire&mdash;whatever it takes te be the last pirate afloat an' win the game! It's easy te learn an' totally wicked fun to play!<br/><br/>",

It is low-tide and the waterline will recede (= a tile is turned over) whenever a moon symbol is rolled. New oysters are put on the new beach tile. After all tiles have become beach, it is high-tide: each moon symbol rolled means that a tile has to be turned over again. When all tiles have become water, the game is over.<br/>A player rolling an oyster may look under an oyster: if it is empty, he puts it back, if there's a pearl, he takes the counter. If he rolls the arrow symbol, he also looks for an oyster but puts an additional oyster on one of the beach tiles. The player with the most pearls gets a pearl card.

Six cardboard bikers on wooden bases are provided but the rule sheet states that the number of players is not limited; there are two dice, one D6, one with special letters on it; a little tin plate; extremely cute tin money in a small pouch and two embossed cardboard medals.<br/><br/>The rules encourage the players to play all three tracks in succession - though it is also possible to play only a single track. Play goes counter-clockwise(!). All spaces on the board are numbered, special events on some of these numbers are explained in the rules (&quot;put money on the plate&quot;, &quot;collect money from the other players&quot;, &quot;go back some spaces&quot; and so on).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jerome Park Steeplechase is a very early game from McLoughlin Brothers and was produced circa 1885. Jerome Park itself was located in the Fordham section of the Bronx and staged races from the late 1860's to around 1890.<br/><br/>The game; Players decide before the game begins what wagers the game would be played for. Each horse would cost a player some pre-determined amount of money. After casting lots with dice to decide what order each player would move in, each player would roll the dice and then place their horse on the number rolled. Each player could take several horses but the cost to have more than one would increase. Having a second horse in the race would cost the owner one and a half times the fee for the initial horse.<br/><br/>There were bad spots on the board. The #10 spot forced a player to lose his next turn and spots 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 forced players to go back to their previous position on the board. Spots 16,33,48 &amp; 68 were places where hedges were located. If one rolled a number that would place ones horse on any of these numbers one had to pay a fine of the entrance fee for the horse and then return to the place one started this turn from. As one gets closer to the finish line the number of dice one throws decreases so players in the rear have an opportunity to catch up. First player to reach spot number 100 wins and collects whatever wagers were involved in the game. If you rolled more than 100 then, on subsequent turns, you would roll the die and go backwards or forward whatever number you rolled until you reached the 100 square exactly.<br/><br/>",

Players attempt to complete a &quot;book&quot; of cards (all four numbered cards of a given letter) by collecting the necessary cards from opponents.<br/><br/>Simple games are played like Go Fish where a player asks for a card by letter and number from any other player.<br/><br/>Players can play more challenging games using biblical quotes at the bottom of each card. Before a card is surrendered, the quote is read and the active player must state the book of the bible from which the quotation comes.<br/><br/>There are also topics at the bottom of the cards allowing for play similar to the Game of Authors.<br/><br/>The cards feature black and white illustrations by world renowned artists (and even some world renowned paintings) such as DaVinci's Last Supper and Hoffmann's ubiquitous version of Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane.<br/><br/>Also includes works by Dor&eacute;, Bougereau, Plockhorst, Portaels, Le Rolle, Muller, Godall, Benz, Mengelberg, Zimmermann, Cornicelius, Richter, Kirkbuck, Murillo, Rubens, Grieger, Munkacsy, Herriach, Raphael, Reni, Schonherr, and Coletti.<br/><br/>",

Battlefield sections are great for ACW and WWII, but medieval battles need a different approach. The left-center-right wing Battle Cry/Memoir '44 principle has here been replaced by color-coding the units red, green and blue (activated by cards of the same color) thus enabling the players to concentrate their units anywhere on the battlefield if they wish so. Also, quality of armor plays a prominent role in medieval battles. Therefore the symbols on the dice are no longer representing infantry - cavalry - artillery but rather the quality of the armor of the troops targeted, whereby troops with heavier armor stand less of a chance of being killed than soldiers with lighter or no armor (see rules).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from publisher)<br/>The next in DGA's critically acclaimed Battlecards: World Conflict series, Six Days of Destiny captures all the action, political maneuvers, and intrigue of the 1967 Arab-Israeli conflict. While little is taught in today's classrooms about the war, this modern day David and Goliath story is still forming the world we live in.<br/><br/>In May of 1967, after a 10 year buildup of Arab military force in Sinai, Egyptian president Gamal Abdel Nasser amassed the armies of Egypt, Syria, and Jordan on the borders of Israel. By the end of that same month, Egypt engaged in the first official military action of the 6-day war by declaring a naval blockade against the nation of Israel. After concentrating an enormous Arab amphibious assault force just 17km from the coast of Israel, Nasser ominously proclaimed, &quot;The armies of Egypt, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon are poised on the borders of Israel...to face the challenge, while standing behind us are the armies of Iraq, Algeria, Kuwait, Sudan and the whole Arab nation. This act will astound the world. Today they will know that the Arabs are arranged for battle, the critical hour has arrived. We have reached the stage of serious action and not declarations.&quot;<br/><br/>Echoing these sentiments, the Iraqi President Abdur Rahman Aref boldly declared, &quot;The existence of Israel is an error which must be rectified. This is our opportunity to wipe out the ignominy that has been with us since 1948. Our goal is clear: 'to wipe Israel off the map'.&quot;<br/><br/>But Israel refused to go quietly into the night. On June 5th, 1967, the Israeli Air Force launched a pre-emptive attack against Egyptian airfields full of bombers, poised for the assault. One of the shortest, yet most influential wars since World War II had begun in earnest, and almost 40 years later, the world is still sorting out the aftermath.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game consists of a narrow plastic board about 20&quot; long with a plastic 'kicking mule' in a &quot;corral&quot; at either end.  A small plastic ball is connected to a length of string which originates from the center of the board.  A scoring track runs along each edge of the board between the corrals.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing the ball on the hind feet of their kicking mule and attempt to kick the ball into the opposite corral by flicking down the front legs of their mule.  A point is scored each time the ball comes to rest in their opponent's corral and the relevant marker is advanced one notch along the scoring track.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the end of their scoring track (19 successful kicks) is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It is ruled off in 1&quot; squares, with numbers from 0 to 9 printed in about 10% of the squares. The tiles are cardboard counters of decent thickness - the numbers are red and the symbols (+, -, and =) yellow.<br/><br/>Players mix up the tiles, then draw seven numbers and three signs.  In turn, each player places tiles on the board to make a &quot;legal&quot; equation, using at least one tile already on the board, crossword-style.  Typical Scrabble rules are used regarding challenges and redraws.  Player score the sum of the numbers they used, disregarding the results of the equation they formed.  If a tile is placed on a space bearing the same number, it's double score.<br/><br/>A surprising rule is that a player may remove the equal sign from an equation on the board and replace it with a plus or minus if they can form a new equation that way.  The removed &quot;=&quot; is reused further down the new equation.<br/><br/>Game meant for 2nd/3rd Grade and up.<br/><br/>",

The rules are similar to Monopoly's with some exceptions, the main one being that ownership of a group is not required for development, but owning three properties in a row triples rent on them.<br/><br/>",

In that world there is a place for everyone, and fun for everyone. There is also a place for all of the words on earth - those in your own language, those in foreign languages, ordinary words, and words that are the names of persons or places - if the letters of an alphabet can be used to spell them.<br/><br/>The game can be as easy, or as difficult, as the players choose to make it - among yourselves you agree on the kind of words that are to be used. The playing time can be readily adjusted to suit your convenience.<br/><br/>Above all, KAN ZEN is a world for those who let their imagination soar, discovering how much enjoyment they can have with a game that permits almost infinite variation.<br/><br/>KAN ZEN AT A GLANCE:<br/><br/>The board is a circular track, on which a step is taken for each letter of a word played. Letters drawn at random at the beginning of each move must be included in the words that you use. UP-TURNS, where the TALLY (letter count) is added to your score, alternate with DOWN-TURNS, where the TALLY is subtracted, unless evasive action is taken. The &quot;perfect&quot; words are those whose TALLIES enable you to move to sectors of the circle where the best advantage can be taken on multiple scoring opportunities on UP-TURNS or where losses can be avoided or minimized on DOWN-TURNS. The winner is the player with the highest net accumulative TALLY at the end of the game.<br/><br/>HOW MANY CAN PLAY?<br/><br/>Two, three or four sides can play the highly competitive versions of the The Perfect Word Game - as individuals, partners or teams.<br/><br/>The game can also be played &quot;solo&quot;. Those who love words, or who find pleasure in drawing on a well-stocked memory of names of persons and places, may well consider KAN ZEN the best solitaire game in the world.<br/><br/>",

The subject is something like &quot;Name a city by the river ....&quot;. The examiner reads the question and fills in the blank with something of his own choosing. If the student can answer, he gets a diploma in that subject (there are four different subjects). If the student can't answer, the examiner must answer the question. If he can't, he gets a warning. Otherwise, the student gets the warning. The rest of the players are arbiters in the case of disputes as to what is the correct answer to a question.<br/><br/>After collecting three diplomas, the player is finished with high school and can now start working on his doctorate. To achieve that, he must get a diploma in each of the four subjects. Once he has that, he must also hold a lecture. To get the subject of his lecture, the player arranges his diplomas in a certain order and reads the sentence that this creates (if he has more than one diploma in a subject he may choose which one to use). This will result in a subject like &quot;The bad influence / of movies / upon art / in troubled times.&quot; The student must now keep a two-minute lecture on this subject. If there are no obvious errors in his lecture, he gets his doctorate. To become a professor, the doctor must get another diploma in each subject and hold another lecture over a given subject.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/> - 48 student question cards<br/> - 16 doctor question cards<br/> - 12 warning cards<br/> - 64 diplomas<br/> - 6 &quot;finished high school&quot; counters (student's cap)<br/> - 6 &quot;become a doctor&quot; counters (doctor's hat)<br/> - 1 &quot;become a professor&quot; counter (laurel)<br/> - Rules booklet<br/> - Booklet with explanations of questions<br/><br/>",

If the color is pink or a friendly color, the player places markers in the number of spaces shown.  If an opposing color, the player may choose to place the opposing markers on the board.  If white, the player takes opposing markers off the board.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of four possible conditions are met - one team controls the main diagonal of the board, one team controls all squares of their colors, etc.  None of these conditions automatically win the game, but some add points to the team's score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Casey Jones Game Box contains three games: Blow the Whistle, Capital Run, and Freight Train.  All games are played with a single die, and (at most) 20 train cars.  Blow the Whistle is a simple race game for two players, playable by children as young as three-years-old. Players roll and move, with the requirement that they make horn sounds at certain points in the game.  The first player to reach the finish line wins.  Capital Run is a game for older children, with up to four players.  This game also has a roll-and-move mechanic, and players must successfully name state capitals in order to earn a turn, with the object to cross the country on a preset path.  Freight train is light but nontrivial game for two players, requiring players to assemble a set of different types of trains.  These trains (coal tender, box car, flat car, cattle car) begin the game on preset spaces, and players must roll around the board and assemble their set.  There are several opportunities for decisions.<br/><br/>",

Players learn how the same word can represent different parts of speech based on how it is used in a sentence.<br/> As they move around the board, drawing cards and reading sentences, players identify the parts of speech of selected words. All words are used in sentence context for meaningful learning.<br/> The Reference Sheet, included, allows players to familiarize themselves with the parts of speech. Younger players can use the Reference Sheet while playing the game.<br/> The object is to cover the most spaces on the board before one player runs out of markers.

The first player to fail to place their block, or to think they can't place their block loses.<br/>This game features head to head play, and team play in partnerships of 2.  There are 2 sets of 24 blocks made of reclaimed wood, a base with a 5&times;5 grid, and two bags for each player's blocks.<br/>The idea in placing a block is to set yourself up with as many future options as possible while trying to eliminate placement options for the opponent.<br/>This game is an excellent tool for teaching small motor skills and spatial recognition.  It can be played by children age 6 and up.  It's one of those games that take 5 minutes to learn, and a lifetime to master.  It offers great replayability as each game is short, and each tower you build is unique.<br/><br/>",

The space they land on allows them to get cards (1-3), lose a card, or use a particular letter with their cards to form a word.  You may end the round by calling a word if it is 4 letters or longer.  Similar to gin rummy, you get the points for the word you call only if it isn't beaten by another player.  If beaten, the higher player gets your points *plus* his.  After the scoring, the board and cards are reset, and another round starts.  The winner is the first to reach the total point goal.<br/><br/>",

First, it will provide you with many hours of fun as you try to outlive your opponents by keeping yourself as healthy as possible. You will begin the game as most people begin life; with a clean bill of health. Staying healthy and risk free won't always be so easy. As the game progresses, as in life, risk factors will increase. Some are predictable, some are not. Some are good for you, some are not. You may end up in the hospital, possibly more than once. Perhaps an operation will be necessary and you may find yourself in the operating room. If successful, you continue the game. If not, you'll find yourself in the I.C.U. Many twists and turns await all the players. In any event, you'll find yourself having loads of fun as you attempt to remain healthy. Secondly, it is intended to educate all players about many of the risk factors associated with heart disease and heart attacks in an attempt to help everyone minimize their risks for having these problems. It is our belief that learning is much more effective when it's fun. Although the information presented about heart disease and heart attacks is valuable information for everyone, this game is not intended to provide medical advice to anyone. Any person who believes they are at risk for these problems, should consult a doctor for specific and individualized treatment and advice.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the website:<br/><br/>After the military failure of the North Vietnamese Tet offensive in January, the NVA conducted their first divisional attack in the Tay Ninh environs during a hot, monsoonal August. It was the last attempt to &quot;spill American blood&quot; in large quantities. Politically, the January attack was a success as the American media heavily reported it. Militarily, it had totally failed in the assigned objectives. For the August offensive, the NVA concentrated two divisions, the 5th and 9th. The 5th had grown to 15,000 men and elements of the plan called for the capture of American M113 APCs from the 10l ARVN squadron to infiltrate into the US headquarters for it's destruction. The plan also called for the divisions to be used piecemeal with the objective of killing Americans and occupying Tay Ninh City. Such an event would reap a political bonanza equal to the Tet Offensive. It was thought this would decimate US morale because War Zone C was well occupied by American troops. More important to the NVA plan was the hope that the awesome American airpower would be neutralized by the August monsoons. For the next 11 days, a hectic, fierce battle strung out the Americans and their M-48 tanks. When the NVA occupied over five city blocks of Tay Ninh, it was the worst nightmare for the US.<br/><br/>Game contains:<br/>2 11x17 inch maps (which combines together)<br/>280 counters<br/>Player aids, charts and tables.<br/><br/>Scale: company and platoon level, each hex 1/2 mile, each turn one day for a total of 11 turns.<br/><br/>",

The special spinner design will tell you how many moves to take and randomly pick a Judge with every spin!<br/> Once a Judge has been decided, and the player has moved his/her player piece the appropriate number of spaces, the Judge then picks a card and reads from the corresponding color the player lands on. The players then perform the activity on the card for the Judge, and then the Judge decides who s/he liked the best. (Remember the Judge has all the power, and can require activities be done again, if he just can't quite choose!)  Those players get to move 3 free spaces on the board.<br/><br/>Red is Impressions<br/>Blue is Art<br/>Yellow is Performance<br/><br/>In the event that the Judge must read a Red, the players must do their best Impression of whatever is on the card. If the Judge reads an Yellow, the players must do their best Performance of whatever is on the card. When the Judge reads a Blue, the players use the sand timer and have 30 secs to Draw whatever is on the card.<br/><br/>By the end of game play, all players will have had the chance to Judge, show their skills in all of the categories. Hilarity results from performing the said Idiosyncrasy successfully, as well as the attempts made along the way.<br/><br/>The player who makes her way around the board to the end, first, wins the game.

They are competing against the Stagecoach Line in order to obtain a contract to carry gold shipments from the small western towns to Carson City.  The players and the Stagecoach all start from the same point and move along the various trails trying to be the first to reach a town and collect the gold to take to Carson City.  If the Stagecoach reaches a town first it will pick up the gold and the Pony Express riders will have to try to get to the next town before the Stagecoach.  The winner will be the first player to collect three gold shipments and get them to Carson City before the Stagecoach arrives.<br/><br/>",

With most of its remaining population already having endured years of privation and growing squalor, mass deportations, and learning that soon the Nazis would be back to send the remainder to Concentration Camps, an insurrection broke out on the eve of Adolf Hitler&rsquo;s birthday. Local SS commander, Jurgen Stroop, believed the troops he had on-hand would make for a quick end to this impudent act of defiance by the Jews and the Polish Home Army members who choose to rise up against the Third Reich. His underestimation of the Jewish and Polish defenders was a costly mistake, as the fight lasted for weeks and cost the Germans and their fascist allies dearly.&quot;<br/><br/>Firefight Games had to suspend sales of this game.<br/><br/>Map scale: 100 yards per inch<br/>Counter scale: squad/platoon <br/>Game turn: 2 or 3 days<br/><br/>",

Each has a different set of units they can build, with varying capabilities - ships are rated for space combat, ground (bombardment) combat, drive system, and what kind of damage they take from the various combat results.<br/><br/>When a star is explored a card is drawn which determines the class of the inhabitable world found there and, if inhabited, its attitude to each of the players.  In addition to the attitude the value of each kind of planet varies by player.<br/><br/>There are three different long-range movement systems in the game - warp drive, jump drive (similar to warp drive but much less accurate), and stargates, which have to be built and carried to where you want to use them.  Each player uses one of the three systems for their ships.<br/><br/>The second edition, in addition to changing the names of two of the races, changed some of the ship designs which were similar to Star Trek and Star Wars ships.

This game appears to be a teaching aid, as there is little to no strategy, and focuses on highlighting the people, places, and facts of the American Revolutionary War.<br/><br/>It is a roll-and-move game, with a board divided into three sections: a left circular track, a right snake-like track, and a middle track that is a straight-away to the victory space on top.  Each space on the board has a bit of trivia that I assume is intended to be read aloud when a player lands on it.<br/><br/>The flow of the game is as follows:<br/><br/>Section I, People<br/>Players roll and move on the right side of the board, landing on spaces that describe the major players of the war.  Some spaces require you to draw a card, which could move you forward or backward.   The object is to get to the end of the Section I path.<br/><br/>Section II, The Original 13 Colonies<br/>Once they reach the end of Section I, players roll and move on the left side of the board, landing on spaces that represent the 13 colonies.  If a player lands on a colony that they have not previously landed, they mark on a piece of paper that they have &quot;collected&quot; this colony.  Players will continue on the circular path until they have &quot;collected&quot; all 13 colonies, which will allow them to move to Section III.<br/><br/>Section III, The American Character<br/>A player rolls and moves up the center path towards the top of the board.  The player must roll exactly to land on the last space, The Bell Tower, in order to win.<br/><br/>",

Young players more their tugboats from port to port, hoping to be the first to collect 4 different colored chips. Watch out where you land though; just when you think you've won, you lose a ship and have to start again.&quot;<br/><br/>The game has two forms of play, one without cards (younger children) and one with chance cards (older children).<br/>To play the game you move your tugboat around the board based on a dice roll. Depending on where you land you either collect a colored disk (cargo), lose a colored disk (cargo), or nothing happens. The winner is the first player to get one of each colored disk and make it back to the beginning for the board.<br/>In the older child version you can also receive chance cards, depending on where you land. The cards allow the player to move to specific locations, move extra spaces, take extra turns, or lose turns.<br/><br/>Rules in English and French.<br/><br/>",

Whenever a player is on an auction space, an auction is triggered. The auction is done in a similar way as in The Merchants of Amsterdam, meaning that players have to hit a spring driven auction clock to place a bid and win the auction. The object is to buy your vegetables cheap (during an auction) and to sell them with profit (whenever one is one a vegetable space of a sort that one has bought). I suspect this light Dutch bidding game with a high dose of luck (due to the die) was released in the early '90s.<br/><br/>",

Pedal Power is a cycling game in a compact plastic box that can pop open with the game rules and board appearing on the inside of the plastic box (being part of the packaging). This gives the impression that this is a traveling game. The closed box measures 23x13cms. Each player receives 1 colored counter (available colors are red, yellow, white and blue). There are also 4 dice in two colors (red &amp; blue) but the dice don't contain the traditional 1 to 6 numbers but range from 0 to 4 and also includes a cross on one side. The gameboard is a cycling track in an oval shape. Different kind of races can be played on the track: sprint, time trial, chase, keirin or a points race. The mechanism is purely rolling dice thus the luck factor is rather high here.<br/><br/>",

From there, 6 routes of equal length lead to 6 destinations: Edinburgh, Helsinki, Athens, Istanbul, Palermo and Gibraltar.<br/><br/>Object of the game is to be the first player reaching one of the destination towns. Each player has a starting capital of 1000 Deutsche Mark. Towns on the way are stopovers, where the means of transportations to the next town must be fixed. Moreover, a chance card must be drawn, which indicates, if the travel goes on normally, of if additional luggage or passengers must be taken on.<br/><br/>Walking by foot is slow, but the cheapest means of transportation.   Faster movement is desired (bicycle, car, train and airplane), but costs rise drastically when using them. If a player runs out of money, he is eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Dutch cycling game from 1965 was enclosed in the Dutch weekly magazine, called Revue. The gameboard, which is made from glossy magazine paper,  has a 'board' of 38 x 35 cm. The game also contains several tokens, which you had to cut out from the magazine. There is a green and yellow jersey, the polkadot mountain jersey, a tour-caravan token and several 1 to 3 peaked mountain tokens. You need also a die and a number of chips or matches, whatever you like. The paper gameboard has the Tour de France route of 1965 printed on it. At the start, every player gets some chips as starting money. After a stage is finished, the tour caravan pawn moves to the next stage. Every stage has a number printed on, this is important for the dice rolling. You need to roll that number for winning the stage. Since this fame is purely based on dice rolling, the rules are very simple. You can earn or lose chips depending on how the dice rolls. The game ends when the tour caravan reaches the final stage in Paris. The player who has the most chips at this point wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Meteors are used to block opponent saucer; they can only be moved, when a king is rolled, but the can be placed everywhere on the board then.

In the game it is possible to enter 7 different races. These are the Tours of France, Spain, USA, Japan, Benelux, Italy or Columbia. The tracks of these races are compiled out of a combination of flat stages, time trials and mountain stages. Movement is decided by rolling 2 dice, when someone rolls a 7 he has to draw a card and answer a question about cycling. The winner is he who wins the overall classifying of all races.<br/><br/>",

There are 6 pawns, each representing a player. What makes it original is that movement is not decided by dice but by a spinning device (also ranging from 1 movement space to maximum 6). Every space on the board track also has text upon it, either giving the player luck or bad luck. Winner is the one who crosses the finish line first.<br/><br/>The same board and spinner looks to have also been issued under the name The Game of Bicycle Race&quot;&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The concept of the game is the same but considerable differences in graphics can be seen on the board, spinner and box. The US version shows the Americas visible from earth while the Australian version shows Australia and south-east Asia. The spaceship playing pieces are the same as the US game although the instructions suggest only 4 players instead of 5 in the US version. As players advance around the board they collect (or lose) gold nuggets which are simply small stones painted gold. This also seems to differ from the collecting pieces in the US version.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, each player has the same number of 10 episode cards in hand. He also has a Yes card and a No card.<br/><br/>One of the players begins and reads the text from one of this episode cards. Then, the players try to guess how the majority of the players would act in the situation described. They choose either their Yes or No card, laying it face-down on the table in front of themselves.<br/><br/>Each player that chose the majority answer gets a point. These are represented by blue Zabutons (traditional Japanese pillows). The pillows have a symbolic meaning for many Japanese. Traditionally, Japanese comedians sit on blue zabutons during their performance, and they are sometimes given to others whose opinions are given the utmost respect.<br/><br/>But here Crossroad doesn't end - because it is highly honored when a player is alone in his opinion and manages to defend his position well. Here, a golden zabuton is awarded...<br/><br/>Toshiko Kikkawa is an organizational psychologist and professor at Keio University in Tokyo Katsuya Yamori is a social psychologist and professor at Kyoto University Tsuyoshi Ajiro is a freelance game designer<br/><br/>",

Dinner party guests answer trivia, create toasts and play name-that-tune to reach the finish line, where they'll be assigned cooking jobs to help create a three course meal. The game includes invitations, recipe cards, ingredients and equipment lists, and a step-by-step guide.<br/><br/>Participants complete all cooking after playing each round using the finish line instruction cards. The Game often gets interesting as teams position for various responsibilities for that particular course.<br/><br/>Get ready for a great evening! Convivium is designed to facilitate conversation during that game as well as prepare a 3-course meal. This makes for a complete evening so set aside approximately 45 minutes for each round if you want to play the entire game (if you want a shorter game you can reduce the number of rounds - it's completely up to you).<br/><br/>",

Magic Challenge is an opportunity for those people, because the game has, like they say in computer language, an open source code: The rules are open to everyone. They can be copied and passed on to everybody. It&rsquo;s not that difficult with only 3 pages of rules.<br/><br/>",

The smaller air dragon returned the roar and beat its long wings as it began to gain altitude. Vermix was large, a fire dragon of both mighty age and size. With some amusement Vermix mused on the foolish air dragon and how it would perish under his talons and burn with his breath.<br/><br/>Beating his own great wings, the massive fire dragon rose slowly. Meanwhile the swifter air dragon had reached a great height overhead and with a shriek, folded its wings tightly against its sinuous body and dove into Vermix like some blue-grey spear, thrown by an angry god of war.<br/><br/>The two dragons crashed into each other with bone shattering force. Stunned by the impact, Vermix struggled to bite at his foe, but the smaller air dragon had gained a tight grip on the fire dragon's fore legs and was even now ripping at Vermix's armored hide with its own sharp talons.<br/><br/>Finally Vermix turned his great head and bit down on the neck of his foe. The air dragon screamed as Vermix crushed its throat, slaying the smaller dragon in one mighty snap of his jaws. Spitting the dead beast from his maul, Vermix turned his body as it fell, trying to scoop the air up with his wings and to either slow his fall or possibly even pull up from of the deadly plummet out of the skies.<br/><br/>As the ground below rushed up, Vermix began to flap his might pinions once more, beating the air with his massive chest muscles, like belts of iron these muscles struggled to gather the wind about him. Slowly he regained control and turned the headlong fall to his doom into a controlled swoop. As he passed mere inches from the tops of the trees of the forest below him, Vermix issued another roar, letting all that could hear that his was king of the dragons still, and would remain so until another dragon took his life and crown.<br/><br/>This is Dragon Wars, yet another Mini-game from Bad Baby Production. In Dragon Wars, you and other players take on the role of a might dragon, dragons that then launch themselves into the skies and battle for supremacy of all about them.<br/><br/>Using a fast turn based system; the combat is swift, the excitement nail biting and the strategy intense.

        "description": "THE HEIRS CARD GAME<br/><br/>GAME CATEGORY: Outplay Game.<br/><br/>GROUP OF GAMES: Matching Games.<br/><br/>THE AIM OF THE PLAYERS: To make other player unable to move a card.<br/><br/>SIMILAR GAMES: Meet the Ancestors, Chess, Checkers, or Draughts.<br/><br/>AMOUNT OF PLAYERS: 2 (or two couples.)<br/><br/>TIME TO PLAY: 10-30 minutes.<br/><br/>CARDS: 32 cards from Six Generations deck. Only cards with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5 are used.<br/><br/>SHUFFLING: Yes.<br/><br/>DEALER: There is no dealer.<br/><br/>SCENARIO:<br/><br/>The Multimillion Dollar Inheritance, Left in 1917 By Californian Gold Miner to His Future Smartest Great-Great-Grandchild, Still Waits for the Winner.<br/><br/>Four generations of Henry Smith's siblings have been waiting for 90 years, for only two of the qualified heirs, Emily and Jacob, brother and sister, to turn sixteen by 2006 and enter into genealogy battle with their numerous ancestors and trustees about what being the &quot;smartest&quot; heir means.<br/>   <br/>    Henry Smith, who made his fortune by discovering gold in California during the Gold Rush and his future investments, signed his will in 1917 at the age of 86. With an unusual precision, he left his 35-year-old son George without the money. Smith was angry that his son was not married, did not have siblings, and was planning to join the United States Army in the battlefield in Europe during WWI, where he could be possibly killed.<br/><br/>Instead, he signed his inheritance to some unknown great-great-grandchild, to be born in the future, and he died shortly afterward. That made his son change his mind, marry soon, have a son named James, and manage the destiny of his other siblings, so they would keep the family dynasty alive for another three generations in order to get the inheritance.<br/><br/>The family line almost stopped when James's only son David was killed in Vietnam in 1964. His father was forced to remarry, and at the age of 47 he and his new wife Linda had another son, Michael. Michael, now 40, and his wife Jennifer, have two children, Emily, 17, and Jacob, 16, who are the straight heirs of their great-great-grandfather Henry.<br/><br/>The judicial problem with selecting the right heir for billion-dollar assets is that even though the children have agreed to share the money equally, they still must compete with each other, because legally the inheritance should be given to only one: the smartest child.<br/><br/>Rules of competition between Emily and Jacob have been set by the board of trustees, who might hold the funds until the contest is over. Emily and Jacob must square off to find the &quot;smartest heir&quot; - by winning the chess-style card game called &quot;The Heirs&quot;.<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>The pack of genealogical playing cards called &quot;Six Generations&quot; will be used to play &quot;The Heirs&quot;. Instead of using the entire 72 card deck, &quot;The Heirs&quot; will be played with only 32 cards numbered 1 to 5.<br/><br/>The playing field consists of 32 squares having 4 rows and 8 columns on it. The total playable size of the field is 15&rdquo; x 20&rdquo; (38 x 50 cm.)<br/><br/>Two players, one of them helping Emily and the other helping Jacob, must open cards placed at random with all their ancestors in four generations and have them join in the thrilling fight for the inheritance.<br/><br/>All cards with black numbers (men) will help Jacob, and the red cards (women) will help Emily to win. The number on each card represents a generation of relatives in the family.<br/> 2 cards from generation #1 are Emily and Jacob, brother and sister, by themselves.<br/> Generation #2 with also two cards is their parents, Jennifer and Michael.<br/><br/>Generation #3 - 4 cards &ndash; represents the children&rsquo;s grandparents - Mary, Linda, James and Robert.<br/><br/>8 cards from generation #4 are their great grandparents - Margaret, Helen, Mildred, Dorothy, George, William, Joseph and John.<br/><br/>And 16 cards from generation #5 are their 16 great-great grandparents including Henry Smith. Their names are Florence, Minnie, Elizabeth, Lillian, Emma, Marie, Alice, Martha, Henry, Harry, Harold, Edward, Walter, Arthur, Frank and Albert.<br/><br/>UNDERSTANDING THE GAME:<br/><br/>According to the story, a family member of the younger generation makes a genealogical search. They then meet in person or find the record of a relative from the same or older generation.<br/><br/>To get the inheritance, Emily and Jacob must prove their relation to Henry Smith, their great-great grandfather. They need to provide a list of all their 30 ancestors in four older generations as well as prove to trustees that they are the only two surviving heirs among his great-great grandchildren.<br/><br/>BEFORE STARTING THE GAME, TWO PLAYERS MUST DO THE FOLLOWING:<br/><br/>1. Decide who will get black cards (men) and who will get red cards (women);<br/><br/>2. Decide who will start the game first;<br/><br/>3. Withdraw 40 cards with numbers &quot;6&quot; from the original Six Generations deck, because they are unusable in &quot;The Heirs&quot; card game;<br/><br/>4. One player must shuffle the remaining 32 cards (with numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and place them in random order face down on the board or the desk in four rows and eight columns. No one should see the face of the cards.<br/><br/>TIP:  During the game try be accurate always keeping the rows and columns with the cards straight.<br/><br/>RULES:<br/><br/>1. The player can make only one move at a time during the turn.<br/>2. The player who was not able to move a card during his or her turn loses the game.<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/><br/>A. If both players are unable to make a move simultaneously, then the player whose turn it is at that time loses the game!<br/><br/>B. If it is your turn to play but you do not have any card of your color on the board - you lose!<br/><br/>EACH PLAYER CAN MOVE A CARD IN THREE DIFFERENT WAYS:<br/><br/>1. The player can simply turn over any card face up. Since there are 32 cards in the game, each player can make at least 16 moves by turning a card face up.<br/><br/>2. If two cards of the opposite colors (black and red) have already been opened in the previous moves, and they have common border from top, bottom, left or right of each other, then the player whose card has a lower or the same number can replace the card of the opposite color by moving their own card to the other card&rsquo;s square. The replaced card has to be discarded from the game and set aside face down.<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/><br/>A.  The same move can be done even if there are several empty squares between the two cards.<br/><br/>B.  The cards should not replace each other if they are attached only by the corners.<br/><br/>C.  Card #1 can replace any card of the opposite color. Card #2 can replace cards from #2 to #5 of the opposite color. Card #3 can replace cards from #3 to #5 of the opposite color. Card #4 can replace cards #4 and #5 of the opposite color. Card #5 can replace only card #5 of the opposite color.<br/><br/>D.  A player whose cards are red can replace only black cards with red cards. A player who is playing with black cards can replace only a red card with a black card.<br/><br/>E.  During this move the player does not need to open any new card.<br/><br/>F.  If there are one or more combinations on the board when one card may replace another card, the player can either choose any combination or can ignore them all and instead open a new card.<br/><br/>G.  The players should not review the discarded cards after the move is done.<br/><br/>H.  If all the cards have been opened already, replacing the correct bordering card becomes the only option for the player.<br/><br/>3. The player can make a move as a combination of moves #1 and #2. If the player has opened a new card which borders with a card of the opposite color from the top, bottom, left or right, (which has already been opened), and if one of those cards, which belongs to the player, can replace the other card, then the player can immediately replace another card in the same move.<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/><br/>A.  This move can be done only between a few cards, one of which is a newly opened card.<br/><br/>B.  If the player decided to open a new card, but there were possibilities of replacing one or more cards on the board before the new card has been opened, those opportunities would be lost and may not be executed during the same move.<br/><br/>GAME STRATEGIES:<br/><br/>- The most important is to save moves for yourself for the end of the game, and to take this opportunity away from the other player.<br/> - Save and protect the cards with the more powerful, lower numbers (like &ldquo;1&rdquo; or &ldquo;2&rdquo;) because they will help you to make more moves at the end.<br/> - Try to block other players&rsquo; best cards inside the cards with the same color so they will not be movable.<br/> - Leave the other players&rsquo; best cards alone on one row or a column, not letting them make any moves.<br/> - As soon as you start memorizing the cards which have been replaced and discarded, and start predicting all the possible moves of the other player and yourself, (usually at the end of the game) you will be at the right place to win. Your memory is your helper.<br/><br/>GOOD LUCK! And don't mess with the cards, neither cheat or misplace them. The trustee is watching you... You have only one chance to play the game and win if you want to become Henry Smith&rsquo;s heir!<br/><br/>The rules and the board to play &quot;The Heirs&quot; are available for copying and printing at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.sixgenerations.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.sixgenerations.com</a>.<br/><br/>ISBN: 0976041804<br/>    MSRP: $8.97<br/><br/>",

With 5 different ships a player goes through every stage that a ship arriving in the Rotterdam harbor would go through. Chance cards influence the things that could happen when a ship goes from Rotterdam to another port. The value of the cargo can increase or decrease, the stock market can change, a ship could even sink or could be forced to change it's route. The moment that a player has all 5 of his ships docked the game ends. The player with the most money in the end wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Singaporean game is intended to be a 'fun way of learning total defence'. It is a simple roll-and-move game in which players move their counter around a track on the board and follow instructions based on the squares they land on. The objective of the game is to obtain one tag in each of the five components of total defence:<br/>Civil Defence<br/>Economic Defence<br/>Psychological Defence<br/>Social Defence<br/>Military Defence<br/><br/>Points are used as currency in this game. Most of the squares give you more points or the option to buy a total defence tag at 15 points each. In addition there are bonus cards which give you goodies like more points or actions to take(e.g. moving your piece forward a certain number of steps). It's not all sweetness and light though - there are not enough total defence tags available for each player to have a full set and players can go on 'Power Hunts' which allow them to 'hunt' (steal being possibly too strong a word to feature in the game) a total defence tag from another player. Players might also have the misfortune to land on a 'Risk' square, which forces them to travel on an inner track where they might possibly land on squares that make them lose points.<br/><br/>The game states it is for players aged 10 years to adult.<br/><br/>",

All players use plastic headstraps that are secured on the forehead with elastic and which act as card holders.  Players begin the game with a predetermined number of cards, depending on the number of participants.  These cards, each depicting an animal, are placed in the headstraps. Each turn, players are allowed three attempts to identify the front card in their headstrap; if successful the card is removed.  THE NAME OF THE ANIMAL MUST NEVER BE SAID - players are only allowed to make renditions of animal sounds.<br/><br/>The first player to empty their headstrap of cards by making the correct animal sounds is the winner.<br/><br/>",

As he stood there chanting the magical words of the summoning, he began to burn, sheathing himself in magical fire.<br/><br/>The wolf then leaped, but almost instantly howled as the fire that now surrounded Markus burned and caught the wolf's fur on fire.

Each player has to roll enough to land on the fence to remove it, no more and no less, you have to roll the exact number to land on the fence. You can then slow your enemy down by placing the fence, that you have just removed, in front of your opponent. Also, if a player, lets say Player &quot;A&quot;, lands on the same space as another player, Player &quot;B&quot;, then player B would be moved back to their starting base.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Malefiz<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player selects the dog he wants to race and lines it up at the starting line. Dog number one starts on the Green #1 spot, dog number two starts on the Orange #2 track etc. The each player rolls three dice. Each dog is moved each time his number is rolled. If one dog's number is rolled on all three dice then that dog moves three spaces. The race continues until the dog reaches the finish line. The Steeple Race is run the same way except that you erect two hurdles on the track. The difference in the steeplecahse game is that in order to jump over the hurdles you must roll doubles of your number.<br/><br/>",

However, the game itself is quite fun.

        "description": "Invasion is a simple wargame concerning a hypothetical invasion of England by an unnamed enemy.<br/><br/>The map shows a square grid superimposed on a map of southeast England, the Channel, and a small section of France and the North Sea (there is a Channel tunnel, interestingly enough). Each player has a small number of men (14 for the English player, 12 for the enemy player) which move from square to adjacent square, or farther if using railway lines. Pieces on adjacent squares may be captured. The enemy player's objective is to move a piece into London, the English player's to capture all the enemies before this happens.<br/><br/>There is an &quot;extended&quot; set of rules which turn this basic abstract system into a bit more of a wargame. Naval movement is now differentiated from land movement (and much faster), the English player may make greater use of the railways than the enemy player, pieces require support to capture opposing pieces, etc. It is also suggested that an umpire be used so that each player only knows the position of his or her pieces.<br/><br/>The game was originally published by F. H. Ayres in a book, Handbook of REVERSI and other new GAMES of SKILL. INVASION. HALMA. FANORONA. Explanations. Rules, Problems and Suggestions to Players, and also in a boxed version (publisher unknown). The book version was reprinted in Sid Sackson's game column in Strategy &amp; Tactics #21, from which all this information is taken.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zards puts a twist on the trick-taking card game.   When a player takes the trick, he is allowed to cast a spell to manipulate the rules governing the rest of the round (when possible). The further the game progresses, the more spells become available.<br/><br/>The game is played from a unique deck of 84 cards ordered by three characteristics: rank, set, and suit. The rank corresponds with the card's spell level. As players increase their score and achieve new levels, more spells open up to them.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, players split the 13 cards dealt to them into a wand of 10 cards and a bag of 3 cards. The wand determines which cards are played during the round, while the bag is a selection of pre-determined spells to cast during the round. Spells are only cast by a player taking the trick.<br/><br/>Zards is unique to other trick-taking games:<br/>    * Zards is adjustable to play 3 to 6 players without the need to add or remove cards from the deck.<br/>    * By not dealing out the entire deck, the ability to accurately count cards is reduced, providing more comfort for novices playing against experts.<br/>    * Players can manipulate the rules for the round with a selection of over 20 spells.<br/>    * Each round allows the player in last place the advantage of playing first. Though, maintaining the lead depends on how cards are played and spells are cast.<br/><br/>",

If the peg lands on an out, then the batter is out.  There are 4 Stands that represent hits.  Hit 1 for a single, 2 for a double, 3 for a triple and hit all four for a home run.<br/><br/>And there was also this non-electric entry, from 1945 -- Whiz Baseball.  The artwork and yellow box are rather reminiscent of that for Senior Model 66-B. The red bits seen on the gameboard at right are not lightbulbs, but wooden pegs. A small top placed on the inclined lower sixth of the board was spun with the fingers, and the pegs it knocked over and the holes in which it landed determined the result of each play -- similar to Milton Bradley's much smaller 1957 version of Swat Baseball.

The players choose one of ten maps on which to play. Each map uses a square grid to regulate movement.<br/><br/>Players adjust the counters on each unit to ten strength points. The players then place the units on the map. In turn, each player will move any and all units. When the units are within range of the enemy, they may engage in combat.<br/><br/>Damage done to the defending unit is determined by the lining up the strength points of the units involved on the Combat Wheel and reading the results.<br/><br/>",

The object is to find 3 pieces and only 3 pieces that will cover his card. If a player has 3 pieces on his card that don't completely cover it, he must return a piece to the &quot;Pot&quot; before taking another.

Yes, all the weapons are present, including artillery, but the fun is in getting your men to use them in the most effective way. See why most Civil War combat was close-range firefights &hellip; or maybe you can find a way to change that!<br/><br/>Crucible of Courage includes five scenarios, all historical battles with their own maps and counters for the actual units, each a different view on the tactical details of the American Civil War.<br/><br/>Crucible of Courage scenarios:<br/><br/>1st Manassas (Virginia, July 21, 1861, the opening moments of the battle, Burnside&rsquo;s 2nd RI vs The Louisiana Tigers) <br/>Athens (Missouri, August 5, 1861, local militia, street-fighting, and hollowed logs as cannon) <br/>James Island (SC, June 3, 1862, the Union&rsquo;s initial attempt to attack Charleston by land) <br/>Chickamauga (Georgia, September 18, 1862; Wilder's Brigade, armed with repeateres, holds the bridge against two brigades from Lidell's Division. <br/>James Island, (SC, July 16 1863, the 54th Massachusetts Colored Regiment gets its baptism under fire<br/><br/>Crucible of Courage is designed for quick learning and easy play, a system that has almost unlimited possibilities. Game rules are short, but there are lots of charts and tables to cover every aspect of battle at this micro level. Playing time is 2-4 hours for any scenario.<br/><br/>",

In Magilla Gorilla, the protagonist spent his time languishing in the front display window of Mr. Peebles' pet shop, eating bananas and being a drain on the businessman's finances. Mr. Peebles marked down Magilla's price considerably, but Magilla was invariably only purchased for a short time, typically by some thieves who needed a gorilla to break into a bank or by an advertising company looking for a mascot for their new product. The customers always ended up returning Magilla, forcing Mr. Peebles to return their money. Magilla ended each episode with his catchphrase, &quot;We'll try again next week.&quot;<br/><br/>The object of the game is to acquire Parrots, Cats and Monkeys which help to get you to the finish line instead of being returned to Mr. Peeples.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns rolling 3 dice and removing colored chips from hexagonal pyramid that is made from six triangular parts.  The players total up the numbers on the dice and remove the colored chip that sits on the corresponding number.  If there is no chip left on that number then the player takes any number of chips from numbers that add up to the total of the roll.  When a 13 is rolled the player must take chip that sits on top of the pyramid that is worth negative 13 points.  If a player is unable to take chips that add up to his or her number (ie. another 13 is rolled) then they must pass one of their colored chips to the person on their left.  In this way the &quot;minus 13&quot; chip can be passed on.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each player rolls dice to determine how many points each colored chip is worth.

Introduction text:<br/><br/>&quot;The Games of GODZ is a unique and highly versatile game tool rather than a game in itself... the board is interpreted or subdivided in four different ways to allow the employment of different mathematical systems. Virtually all strategy game sin existence employ some method of mathematical logic thereby making it apparent &quot;the Games of GODZ&quot; is capable of utilizing many systems as the basis for a vast number of games.<br/><br/>The blocks are generally considered to be people and are therefore colored according to the four major races of the world. A block has an opening in one of its faces. This is used to indicate masculinity or femininity, depending on how it is placed on the board.&quot;<br/><br/>General rules explain different moves (where units move a number of squares equal to their value), &quot;trick moves&quot; (where units combine, merge, split, switch or piggyback), takes (capturing or converting the enemy), etc.. Specific rules tell which areas of the board are in play and what moves or takes are allowed. A deck of cards is used with some of the games.<br/><br/>Some games are mainly &quot;movement&quot; games, where the players have to move pieces into enemy or objective spaces, while others are &quot;capture&quot; games, where player have to kill all or specific enemy pieces. An interesting game in the set is &quot;Cry&quot;, specifically for three players. One player plays with two other players, who are playing a different game, to score points by thwarting captures by either player - in effect, becoming a peacekeeper.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/><br/>- one board of 144 squares, divided into many colors and associations.<br/>- 124 plastic blocks: 4 sets of 31 blocks each in red, white, yellow and black. Each set is made up of 16 &quot;ones&quot; (blocks are 1 cubic unit or 1x1x1), 8 &quot;twos&quot; (1x1x2), 4 &quot;fours&quot; (2x2x1), 2 &quot;eights&quot; (2x2x2) and 1 &quot;sixteen&quot; (2x2x4).<br/>144 playing cards: 4 sets of 36 cards each marked in the same colors as the blocks (but not actually so colored) and with an associated letter (G for Brown, O for Red, D for White, and Z for Yellow). Cards are present in the same numbers as with the blocks, with five spares added to make 36 in a set.<br/>- one booklet of 14 pages of general rules and specific rules, as well as rules on how to play Chess and Checkers with the game set.<br/>- one sheet of directions on how to set up the first of the 11 games.<br/><br/>",

Both the state and the inhabitants always called themselves Hellenes/Roman, as did most of their neighbors. Western Europeans, who had their own Roman Empire called them Orientals or Greeks (Hellenes). Byzantion was the ancient name of the capital city and Byzantines after the former name of the Empire's capital city, Constantinople.<br/><br/>Zatrikion is the game of Byzantine chess. This chess has seven variations according to the more ancient board game of &quot;Pessoi&quot;.<br/><br/>These versions have all the known pawns of the modern chess (&quot;Mad Queen&quot; was the first name) and in some variations there are many other pawns connecting to the philosophy of the Byzantine era.<br/><br/>Played with Byzantine Greek era letters for 2 players as the modern chess.<br/>In some versions are three dices with the ancient shapes of Byzantium era and in this version the highest roll starts the game.<br/><br/>Zatrikion has the following items:<br/>1. Seven colorful Boards (Grids).<br/>2. The pawns of each player with different color. In Byzantium era the colors was the veneti (red color) and the greens (green color). These were the political parties in Byzantium era. <br/>3. Three dices with shapes.<br/>4. Other material.<br/>5.

The Playing Fields are divided by rows of red playing spots running toward the center of the board known as Alleys. These Alleys may be traveled from one end to another in a single move if desired. In each game there are 30 shells divided into groups of 5, each group has a different  color. There are also 6 counters numbered 5,10,15,20,25 and 50. At the beginning each player draws a counter, looks at it and then places it beneath one of his shells so that no opponent knows under which shell the counter is.  . The object of the game is to move a shell into the SHELL OUT area of an opponent. You may attempt to capture a shell of your opponent. If you are next to a opponents shell you simply jump on it. Most shells have nothing under them and simply result in your losing your shell. If you find the shell with the scoring marker under it you score it. The hand is over when someone moves a loaded shell unto the opponents SHELL OUT area.<br/><br/>",

That is how the fortune of the party will most change.<br/><br/>Game rules:<br/><br/>This game can be played with up to 4 players.<br/>Each player gets 10 meeples, of which 6 are <br/>to be moved into the opposite destination spaces <br/>of the same color.<br/><br/>The starting player is determined by chance.<br/>The meeples can jump over other meeples of the same <br/>or any other color to get to the destination <br/>spaces (jumping is done like in the Halma game).<br/><br/>Every time a player gets one of his meeples on a <br/>destination space, the turntable gets turned a quarter<br/>turn to the right.<br/><br/>This provides for variety in the gameplay, because <br/>every turn changes the position of the meeples <br/>for every player.<br/><br/>The winner is the player, who is the first to get 6<br/>meeples on the destination spaces.<br/><br/>The 4 remaining meeples are without importance for the<br/>outcome of the game.<br/><br/><br/>Note: This game is played without a die.<br/><br/>",

The game is set in the Hanlin Academy.  Most students are members of the Grand Secretariat of the Hanlin Academy, the body of top-ranking graduates of the civil service examination who serve as advisers to the Wanli emperor.  Some Grand Secretaries are Confucian &quot;purists,&rdquo; who hold that tradition obliges the emperor to name his first-born son as successor; others, in support of the most senior of the Grand Secretaries, maintain that it is within the emperor&rsquo;s right to choose his successor; and still others, as they decide this matter among many issues confronting the empire, continue to scrutinize the teachings of Confucianism for guidance.  The game unfolds amidst the secrecy and intrigue within the walls of the Forbidden City, as scholars struggle to apply Confucian precepts to a dynasty in peril.<br/><br/>",

Will the British transfer power to the Indian National Congress, which claims to speak for all Indians?  Or will a separate Muslim state&mdash;Pakistan&mdash;be carved out of India to be ruled by Muslims, as the Muslim League proposes?  And what will happen to the vulnerable minorities&mdash;such as the Sikhs and untouchables&mdash;or the hundreds of princely states?  As British authority wanes, smoldering tensions among Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs increasingly flare into violent riots that threaten to ignite all India.  Towering above it all is the frail but formidable figure of Gandhi, whom some revere as an apostle of non-violence and others regard as a conniving Hindu politician.  Students struggle to reconcile religious identity with nation building&mdash;perhaps the most intractable and important issue of the modern world.  Texts include the literature of Hindu revival (Chatterjee, Tagore and Tilak); the Koran and the literature of Islamic nationalism (Iqbal); and the writings of Ambedkar, Nehru, Jinnah, and Gandhi.<br/><br/>As in other Reacting to the Past games, participants are given secret role sheets with victory objectives.  Debate and negotiation are the major mechanics used in this game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Description: Henry VIII and the Reformation Parliament transforms students into lords and commoners and members of the English parliament during the tumultuous years of 1529-1536.  Cardinal Wolsey has just been dismissed as lord chancellor for failing to obtain from the pope the divorce king Henry is seeking from Catherine of Aragon, his wife of twenty years.  Thomas More is named as Wolsey&rsquo;s replacement.  More presides over a newly summoned parliament, which the king hopes will somehow find the legal means to annul his marriage to Catherine, thus allowing him to proceed with his plans to marry Anne Boleyn and have by her a male heir.  But will parliament find the means, and will it be satisfied with solving the king&rsquo;s marital and dynastic problems?  There are some in parliament who wish to use the royal divorce, as well as the rising anti-clericalism in the land, to effect a split from Rome and a conversion of England from Catholicism to Protestantism.  Other members oppose the divorce, oppose making the king head of the English church, and, most of all, oppose this new, heretical creed filtering in from the continent.  More is their leader, for as long as he can survive.  Thomas Cromwell leads the king&rsquo;s party.  One problem is that the king is ambivalent about the reform effort unleashed by his so called &ldquo;great matter,&rdquo; and so the conservatives are free to prosecute reformers as heretics, while the reformers are free to prosecute conservatives as traitors.  Conservatives are liable to this charge because their frustration at home tempts them to consider petitioning the king of Spain and Holy Roman Emperor to invade England on behalf of Catholic Europe.  The game reaches its dramatic climax around the trial of Anne Boleyn, staged as a grand contest between opposing parties, which parties actually are multiple and fluid.  All roles are individualized and most are historically based.  At issue is the clash of four contending ideas:  medieval Catholicism, Lutheranism, Renaissance humanism, and Machiavellian statecraft.  Students read works representative of all traditions.<br/><br/>",

Dice on the Inside track move the number of spaces rolled and try to get back to the Outside track.  Dice on the Outside track have more interesting movement options -- (a) move the number rolled, (b) roll 2,3,4,5 and move to that space on the Outside track if it is empty, (c) match a number showing on an opponents dice and take it's place while moving it to the Inside track, (d) roll one less than a number showing on another dice and move to the space just in front of that dice, (e) roll one more than a a number showing on another dice and move to the space just behind that dice.  Any move that causes one to land on an opponent's dice, moves that dice to the Inside track. <br/>The game goal is to land one's dice on one's GOAL space on the Oustside track. Each time a player scores a goal, he moves the scoring cube one stage on the scoring track towards his High Stage.  The scoring track is in the shape of an X.  The four tips of the X are the High Stage for each player.  The center of the X is the Zero Stage.  If another player scores first, a second scoring player would move the scoring cube back to the Zero Stage.  From the Zero Stage, a player would win by scoring 3 consecutive goals.<br/>There is also a short version of the game where the scoring cube is not used and the first player to 3 goals wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;The goal is simple: control every stack on the board. <br/>The higher your stacks, the greater your reach. But to use that reach, you must unstack your pieces, and unstacking may release an opponent's piece that will be used against you. Pieces can move across the entire board in one turn, so you must think globally as well as locally. Tessaron is a different game every time you play. The tide can turn at any moment, so you will have to stay on your toes. The rules are easy to learn, but it could take a lifetime to develop a winning strategy!&quot;<br/><br/>",

The Teaser cards bear a single unique printed word, each to be found on a different one of the Key cards, and space to write in eleven more.  The Key cards are distributed around the playing area (maybe a room, a garden, or larger area) and the players travel between them, following their chain of words.  Points are awarded for both speed of completion, and accuracy in answering the trivia questions.<br/><br/>The Teaser cards are in fact double-sided, with a different word on each side, allowing two rounds.

With millions of variations, you will never have to play the same game twice!<br/><br/>Strategy Seven can be played as a single or multi-player game. It is a unique game that can be tailored to increase the level of difficulty to suit the player/s. Each game includes three Code discs ranging in difficulty from level 1 to level 3. There are additional &quot;Collectors&quot; Code discs available (from level 3 to level 7).<br/><br/>You can increase or decrease the difficulty of each game by choosing various ways of setting up the board. The markers can all be placed on the board with the colored sides facing up to play an easier game. For a more challenging game, the markers can be placed on the board with the numbered sides facing up.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to re-arrange moving pieces, by rotating the center code disc, to enable you to move desired components to their correct locations.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.stencils.co.za/Strategy.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.stencils.co.za/Strategy.htm</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The blue color of your cape leaves an azure streak across the city skyline as you fly above the buildings on patrol. It has been a peaceful night over all, only one bank robbery, and that you stopped with the help of Kid Zip. The explosion rolling out of the building below you then breaks the silence. You watch with your super eyesight as the green color smoke rolls out of the window of one of Sonic Lab&rsquo;s windows. You watch as Doctor Death leaps into the air from that very window, a beaker of the hyper explosive, chemical Y, tightly held in his armed fist. You thought he was still in jail, serving a 300-year sentence for his last attempt at destroying the city. With a sigh you dive into the coming fight, sure it will be another long night ahead. Who said being a super hero was all capes and fun.<br/><br/>Comic Book Heroes is a multi player card game where you take on the role of either a super powered hero or one of their many villainous foes. Streaking through the skies in your hyper jet boots, or crash through brink walls with your super strong muscles. All the thrills, excitement and goofy fun of classic comics are here within Comic Book Heroes. Struggle with and aid other players as they battle each other to see who will be the hero supreme.<br/><br/>So let the cosmic beams fuel your dreams of glory, the mutant genes turn you into a freak with a heart of gold or allow sinister plots to fill you with a destiny for glory and dominance of all mankind. Play Comic Book Heroes and live the adventure.<br/><br/>Each set comes with two characters, a hero and a villain with 18 cards for each. The set also comes with 18 common cards and 18 new common cards only available with that set, for a total of 72 cards per set.<br/><br/>",

A colorful spinner directs gameplay.<br/><br/>Points are scored for raising and lowering the fireman (i.e. adding &amp; then removing ladders) without causing him to fall (10 points per ladder). The fireman must be balanced by holding the bottom ladder ONLY.

This is done by drawing &amp; passing cards just as fast as you can. Watch the mouse and try to guess which number he will point to when he lands because cards of that number become &quot;wild&quot;.'<br/><br/>Box measures 12&quot; x 22&quot; x 2&quot;.<br/><br/>The 22&quot; high firehouse backdrop (thick die cut card with period illustrations) is supported by a plastic base (which also serves as the spinner) and a red plastic roof; a metal rod connects the plastic roof to the center of the spinner.  A plastic mouse attached to a small doughnut shaped piece of plastic is slid onto the top of the metal rod and positioned to commence each round.<br/><br/>The spinner is used to designate 'wild' cards and to keep track of scores and round number. Players are dealt 5 cards; these are made of thick cardstock and are numbered 1-12, with 4 of each number. The mouse is nudged and set on its way. Players attempt to get as many of the same cards as they can by drawing &amp; passing before the mouse reaches the spinner base. Only 5 cards may be held at any time.<br/><br/>When the mouse reaches the spinner below, cards are compared.  The segment which is occupied by the nose of the mouse becomes 'wild', so players can use cards of this number to enhance their hand.  The winner of the hand is the player with the highest number of identical cards, or the holder of the best cards if 2 or more players have an identical number of similar cards.<br/><br/>After 12 rounds of play, the WINNER is the player who has won the most hands.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A proprietary card game based on the standard social card game known in books as &quot;I Doubt It,&quot; but more popularly as &quot;Bulls**t.&quot; It was created by a college business professor in Alva, Okla., in the early 1990s and marketed by his startup company.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 72 cards in 14 denominations. Each denomination, numbered 1 to 14, depicts a leisure activity, such as &quot;Golfing&quot; or &quot;Shopping.&quot; As in &quot;I Doubt It,&quot; the object is to shed all your cards. Players announce in turn that they are discarding a certain number of cards in a certain denomination, always having the option to bluff. The other players can challenge. Anyone losing a challenge must take all the discards.<br/><br/>Unlike &quot;I Doubt It,&quot; the game requires players in turn to play cards in the same denomination rather than increasing denominations. (In other words, if Player 1 plays &quot;Hunting&quot; cards and goes unchallenged, the Player 2 must either play &quot;Hunting&quot; cards or pass.) The denomination changes after a challenge -- or if all players pass, at which point the discard pile is retired and started anew. The game also includes a denomination of wild cards (1, &quot;Anything Goes&quot;), and one denomination (13, &quot;Fooling Around&quot;) that can only be played as part of a bluff.<br/><br/>Once a player sheds all his cards, he scores the point total of all cards remaining in his opponents' hands. The game ends at 100 points. The game also offers rules for couples to play in partnerships.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The rhythm's gonna getcha in this beat-the-beat game.<br/><br/>Who knew you could learn rhythm while laughing? New Flail and Wail offers musical laughs and more. Best of all, players who might think they can&rsquo;t keep a beat, let alone keep up, will have a riot clapping along, shouting with the song, waving, pointing and, well, Flailing. Each player passes the beat around by shouting a Wail sound and making a Flail move &ndash; first theirs and then another player&rsquo;s. As the music speeds up, someone is going to mess up and that&rsquo;s when Miss Dee Beat, the cranky music teacher, steps in. You&rsquo;ll be in trouble when she gives you a dreaded treble (clef). Be the one with the fewest trebles and win. Game includes a fab CD featuring 50 original tunes to shout with and shake at. The game&rsquo;s patented Magic Maraca rocks the dice.<br/><br/>Ages 8 and up. 3 to 8 players.<br/><br/>Copy of Home Page on Internet Archive: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20060323170503/http\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://web.archive.org/web/20060323170503/http</a>://gottalaffgames.com/FlailNwail.html<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lady Lovely Locks And The Pixietails: Seek &amp; Peek Game is a memory game for children.  It includes paper dolls, a gameboard, a spinner, tokens, disks, and a rule sheet.<br/><br/>Each player picks a paper doll at the beginning of the game.  The paper dolls are each in different colors, has drawings of three Pixietail creatures, and has three cut-out portions wherein Pixietail tokens may be inserted.  The object of the game is to be the first player to collect all three Pixietail tokens to insert in her paper doll and find the Castle disk.<br/><br/>Players take turns with the Spinner to determine the area in the gameboard where she may select face-down Pink disks.  If the other side of the disk she picked up has a Pixietail image of the matching color and design (not yet collected), she takes a similar Pixietail token and inserts it in one of the cut-out sections.  She then returns the disks face-down in the same location in the gameboard where she picked them before.  If a non-matching disk was selected, it is also returned to the same location face-down and play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>If a player's doll collects all three Pixietail tokens, that player then picks only Violet disks in her succeeding turns.  If the Castle is then selected from the Violet disks, that player wins the game.  If the &quot;Duchess RavenWaves&quot; was selected from one of the disks, that player must remove one Pixietail token from her doll.  She then again is demoted to select Pink tokens only until she again completes all her Pixietail tokens.<br/><br/>",

There are a few provisions for calling special plays, such as bunting, hit-and-run, and playing the infield &quot;in&quot;. The game being a self-contained simulation, it needs little user input.

        "description": "This football game was created By Howard H. Jones who was not only the President of the Municipal Service Corp., Ltd. which produced the game but also the Coach of the Southern California 1931 National Championship team.<br/><br/>Kickoff's, Field Goals  and Punts use a special mechanical device that kicks the ball.<br/><br/>On Offense the player chooses one of 8 possible plays to call and then spins an arrow which stops on letters. Then the defense spins the arrow and gets a letter result. The result of these two spins determines what happens to the ball.<br/><br/>As an aside here is a couple of words of advice from the head coach about football strategy from the times.<br/><br/>Question: With 4th down and a foot in a scoreless tie shall I attempt to make the foot or punt the ball. ANSWER from COACH: You should have really punted on 3rd down. By all means PUNT, failure to make a 1st down would put your opponent in good position to score.<br/><br/>Question: Is it safe to attempt a forward pass while still within ones own 40 yard line. ANSWER: Usually it isn't. There are times when this play is worked with success. One can only depend on ones own judgment.<br/><br/>Question: With the score 9 to 7 against me with 3 minutes to go in the game and the ball on my opponents 28 yard line what play would you use?  ANSWER: A wide end run to get the ball in the center of the field on 1st down and then I would try a place kick on 2nd down<br/><br/>",

Combat is resolved using the usual die rolls and tables, with the different makes of helicopter being able to take different amounts of damage before they are eliminated.<br/><br/>The majority of the rule book is taken up with the helicopter data sheets and there are no less than 46 of them.

The object in each is to be the first player to have his or her traveler cross from one side of the board to the other.  When one player does, on the following turn the Gauntlet will begin to collapse, starting with the innermost square and proceeding outward by &quot;rings&quot; with each turn until the entire board has collapsed.  If no other players make it across the Gauntlet before the entire board has fallen, the first player wins the game.  If any other player makes it across to tie the first player, the tied player who has accumulated the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Swim Quest was conceived as a board game that could be incorporated into swimming practices. It is designed to be constructed from waterproof materials, including a dry-erase board for keeping score. A spinner governs how many spaces the players move their pieces around a conventional track. The pieces are in thematic shapes: diver, freestyle, stopwatch, and pair of fins. Spaces on the board contain instructions for swimming activities, to be performed by the player who lands on the space (e.g., &quot;4 laps, freestyle&quot;). Some spaces have other instructions, such as &quot;Go back 1 space&quot; or &quot;Do 20 crunches.&quot; Swim Quest has been awarded US Patent number 7125016B1.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Doraemon Mao Xian Wang directly translates as Doraemon Adventure King. This made-in-Hong-Kong board game uses the popular Japanese cartoon, Doraemon, as its theme.<br/><br/>Doraemon is a lovable cat-robot from the 22nd century, who is sent back in time to present-day Japan to help Nobita, a pitiful school kid who is best described as a loser. Doraemon wears a magical pouch on his tummy from which he produces the most amazing gadgets to help Nobita, but Nobita somehow always manages to misuse them.<br/><br/>The game belongs to the large family of 'Millionaire' clones, which is itself derived from Monopoly. Players take on the role of one of four characters from the cartoon series: Doraemon; Nobita; Shizuka (Nobita's girlfriend); and Dorami (Doraemon's sister). Each player has a nifty miniature figurine to move around the track. Dice-rolls move the figurines and players earn or spend money according to where they land. Instead of properties, players land on adventures which they can 'purchase' and other players landing there in future have to pay the owner of the adventure. There are also chance cards.<br/><br/>The manufacturer, Sun Hing Toys, makes several other Doraemon-themed board games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Take your one-man fighter into Q-space and engage your opponent head on in a duel to the death.  Two players, each using one of the two enclosed play books, try to maneuver each other into their own firing arcs using the easy to use movement charts given on each page.  As you and your opponent move, you flip to a new page, which shows your new position and sensor displays.<br/><br/>The game uses a system similar to that used in the Ace of Aces series of games; players simultaneously choose a direction to move and these choices are cross-referenced to determine which page each turns to. The ships normally can only move to one of their three forward spaces or stay in place, but by spending shield points a ship can move directly sideways. If a player has the opponent within their firing arc they can choose to fire; shots remove more shield points at close range and ships can only fire every other turn. When a ship is out of shield points the opponent wins. Optional rules allow for the possibility that moving and firing will sometimes fail.<br/><br/>The end of the rulebook mentions several related products: Q-Fighter DT (more detailed rules), Kree Tech (a wallet-sized version), and Fringe Wars, a card-based expansion which added campaign rules. However, it is unclear if any of these were ever published.<br/><br/>",

Moving and capturing are like in checkers, however there are some interesting twists: Players can move over their own stone to built a defense more carefully. In the middle of the Board there is an area where the same stones can be played by both partners to create momentum.

        "description": "From the Patch Products Press Release:<br/><br/>Loose Lips&trade; is more than a drawing game, more than an acting game and more than a talking game. It's all three games in one.<br/><br/>When you play Loose Lips, you'll give clues by talking in some rounds and acting or drawing in other rounds. Your goal is to get your teammates to guess the answer without letting forbidden similar words slip off their lips. If they guess the right word, your team scores. But if your team has loose lips and says the forbidden words, the other team scores.<br/><br/>Here's an example: If the answer is Hawk and the forbidden Lip Slips are Bird and Buzzard, you'll have to give clues to get your team to say Hawk without saying the similar forbidden words&mdash;Bird or Buzzard. And you only have 60 seconds! This fast-paced party game will keep your teammates' lips moving while you talk, act or draw your way through each word.<br/><br/>Loose Lips is played with 4 or more players in 2 teams, ages 12 to adult<br/><br/>",

Each team when it&rsquo;s their turn rolls a die, and by that roll, they&rsquo;ll know whether they&rsquo;re trying to solve a one, two, or three syllable word.<br/><br/>There are 500 playing cards in the game, each with a die representation from one to six. If a team tosses a 1 or 4 they will try to solve a one syllable word, toss a 2 or 5 they will try to solve a two syllable word, and finally if they toss a 3 or 6 they will try to solve a three syllable word. On each card there are random pictures of a red die, which are (all play) cards and the remaining picture of dies are in white (for that team only) cards.<br/><br/>Each team will choose their partner to either be the giver or receiver of clues, and will alternate roles each time. No team member can be a giver or receiver more than once in a row. The giver of the clues can draw, do gestures, or give one word clues to get their partner to guess the target word. NO talking other than one word clues!<br/><br/>There are three special symbols that might be on the cards. One that lets your partner know that a word sounds like another. Second, a symbol that indicates that you&rsquo;re looking for a word opposite of the word given as a clue. Finally third, a hand that shows either one, two, or three fingers which lets your partner know your looking for the first, second, or third syllable of a word to use with other syllables to eventually solve the target word.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An extraordinarily rare game I recall playing as a child, Winflation' is little more than a fond memory for me now.  It belonged to a childhood friend--a gift from the designer, if I recall correctly--and I've never seen it in a store.<br/><br/>To the best of my recollection, there were similarities to roll 'n' move games such as PayDay or Life:  The board was a simple figure-eight track around which the playing pieces would move, and each space had some sort of action or consequence for the player; there were also free spaces that required no activity.  In addition, there were stock certificates that could be purchased and/or traded as well as cards to be drawn at certain points; the cards also had ramifications for the player, similar to the Chance/Community Chest cards in Monopoly.<br/><br/>I'm afraid I don't recall the specific mechanics--obviously the notion of inflation was part of the game--but the essential goal was to remain solvent and earn more money than your opponent(s).  My recollection is that the game ended when a certain period of time had passed, most likely defined by a set number of laps around the board.  I enjoyed the game quite a bit when I was a kid:  It seemed more sophisticated and complex than its roll 'n' move cousins, and I recall there being a number of potential activities to be undertaken with each turn.<br/><br/>I would love to hear from anyone else who has played this rare gem.  It was published by a company called Zany Eights Productions, Inc., in Pottstown, PA; I suspect that the first-and-only print run was very limited, and Zany Eights never published any other games, as far as I know.<br/><br/>edit:<br/>From the Rules:<br/>The object of the game is to be the last remaining played on the board who has survived week after week of spiraling inflation.  As inflation becomes worse and the cost of living increases, each player must meet his daily expenses, while making sure his salary keeps pace with current prices. Most Importantly, each player must keep his job in order to avoid certain financial disaster. Although provisions have been made for only six players, any number may participate. The amount of time required for each game varies with the rate of inflation.<br/><br/>",

In a time before the unleashing of Black Powder the third epoch in Valon's history is if anything more disjointed and scarred than the subsequent Age.  Morgana the Empress of the Crystal Elf Empire sits upon the Peacock Throne with her younger son Mordred at her knee, she has ruled a thousand years and in her resides the best chance to halt the decay.<br/><br/>Maelstrome is a fantasy mass combat system based in part on the famous Slaughterloo game and it features many of the same races and creatures that players will already be familiar with, though they are much changed.  Alongside the Crystal Elves, progenitors of the Ferach, are the Krautan Dwarves members of a League encompassing hundreds of small baronies and thiefdoms.  The Krautans are next in strength to the Crystal Empire and more powerful than the Cities of Man that have appeared across the central continent.   Other organized states try to hang onto the vestiges of a disappearing civilization but it has not been easy for the Undead led by the sinister Necromancers and the Dragon Children or Dracci have rampaged across Valon embroiled in their own huge war that decimates all who fall in its path.<br/><br/>From the frozen north the shambling Undead have crumbled many societies and created free booters and mercenaries who sell their swords to the highest bidders, among them the Gnome Legion and the Dogmen of Stasia.  It is in Alevia a former province of the Crystal Empire that the mighty Elf regiments make their stand against the Undead and the Dracci.  It is from the vast sea in the south beyond Ibe-Herra that the Dragons came bringing carnage to the Goblin Principalities behind their wooden walls and forming an alliance of convenience with the fawning Lizardmen.  Savage Orc tribes migrate across all these battle torn lands bringing more pain, though as always their enemies loose flights of barbed arrows upon their approach.<br/><br/>Choose your side carefully in the Maelstrome for though you may admire the remorseless Necromancers or the fury of the Dracci the other races have much to offer.  March with the Imperial Elf Regiments or the Regiments of the Wood Elves not forgetting the armies of Man or the Orc Tribes.  All can hire warriors from a common pool of fighters, entire units of Ogres, Mountain Orcs even Gnomes who kill with hundred tiny blades.  Do not forget of course that your army must have a powerful Mage to wield Wylde Magick in a nimbus of power to pour on your foes each race sports different lethal incantations.  Also you can use a Beast Handler to control huge savage monsters that are the doom of a multitude of soldiers, War Trolls and Corpse Monsters assembled from piles of the recently dead.<br/><br/>Once this army of yours is assembled and stands ready uniforms bright or armour rusted and well used you must select a Warlord and special leaders to drive your units forward.   In the Maelstrome all must fight for their own ends and alliances seldom last out a season.<br/><br/>",

The publisher was a specialty import company that dealt mainly in Dutch and French dishes and pewter, Royal Leerdam, Delft, Quimper, etc.  No designer is listed.<br/><br/>The game consists of a deck of cards representing nations or geographic areas and the object is to complete a &quot;hand&quot; of nations that dominates the world political scene to the extent of being able to enforce a &quot;Pax&quot; similar to the ancient Pax Romana.  Specially stamped poker chips are used in bidding for cards.  Besides the rules and a score pad, the game came with a green felt playing surface with a map of the world and other significant items in white.  This surface is known in the rules as &quot;the traditional green table of diplomacy&quot;.  The game came in two types of boxes, one a padded leatherette style and the other a red paper covered cardboard with trays to hold the cards and chips.  The smaller red box has a pocket inside the lid to hold the rules and score pad.<br/><br/>Four players is the optimum number, though rules are given for a three player game.  The four players represent the United States, Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and either France or Germany, as picked by the dealer.  Play then proceeds until one player has built up a hand through either draws, auction, or trading large enough to declare his peculiar pax based on his political leanings.<br/><br/>The four types of Paxes are:<br/>Pax Americana<br/>Pax Muscovita<br/>Pax Atlantica (the English Pax)<br/>Pax Europeana (French or German Pax)<br/><br/>The game betrays its Cold War background by some of the interesting art and factoids on the cards, which are about three times the size of playing cards and are quite colorful with period artwork.  The rules are a scant two pages, but are easily picked up by any traditional card players who are familiar with bridge.  Certain cards are usable only with certain Paxes and vary in value.  The publisher boasted that &quot;Pax is sold in all the free countries of the world.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The other players are given some tokens and, in turn, they ask for a letter: if it is included in the word, the player with the deck of cards places that letter in its correct position on top of the corresponding &quot;?&quot; card; if the letter is not in the word, the player who asked for it must pay 1 token. Whenever a player guesses the word correctly he receives 2 tokens plus as many tokens as &quot;?&quot; cards are still in the word; but if the guessed word is wrong, the player must pay 2 tokens. The player who thought the word receives as many tokens as the difference between the top scorer and the least scorer.<br/><br/>Following the philosophy of the publisher the rules are in Catalan, Spanish, English, French, Basque, Galician, Occitan and Italian.<br/><br/>About the publisher:<br/>The publisher, Linguam&oacute;n &ndash; House of Languages, is a body set up by the Government of Catalonia with the aim of promoting the world's languages as a:<br/><br/>     vehicle for communication, civilization and dialog <br/>     source of personal development, human creativity and heritage of mankind <br/>     right of individuals and of linguistic communities<br/><br/><br/>",

If they are able to lay down cards that total eleven (including at least one 1), then they are able to declare takeoff. Subsequent turns allow the player to move closer to the Moon with their rocket parts, crew or cargo. On arriving at the Moon, they need 11 to get back. This journey has to be undertaken 7 times to win. There is a lot of luck in how the cards fall. However it works for young children learning to count.<br/><br/>Plus rules:<br/>Much like the basic game, except that the game now has Bad Weather (to prevent a takeoff or landing), Meteor Showers (to cause missed turns) and Engine Trouble (to slow down the journey). Of course each problem comes with a solution, Clear Skies, Meteor Shield and Repair Engine.<br/><br/>2*Plus rules:<br/>Bad Weather can either cause a delayed takeoff (one missed turn) or delayed takeoff until Clear Skies are found.<br/><br/>3*Plus rules:<br/>There are two spy cards, these cards can abort an Earth takeoff completely.<br/><br/>4*Plus rules:<br/>The spies become one for the Moon and one for the Earth. Aborting an Earth takeoff just delays the journey. Aborting a Moon landing makes the entire journey useless, and they still have to get back to Earth to start another journey.<br/><br/>5*Plus rules:<br/>Either the journey cards are played like Gin Rummy, when a set is complete, or the journey can be accumulated as they are in Mille Bornes<br/><br/>The game played at 4*Plus can take well over 4 hours, with each Spy testing the best of friendships.<br/><br/>",

In this game, players roll dice and cover (or &quot;black out&quot;) the matching spaces of their respective cities. The first player to fully cover his city announces &quot;BLACKOUT&quot; and wins the game. Counters are also provided in case the players wish to play a series of games, with each player losing one counter per uncovered space to the victor.<br/><br/>As the dice only passes from one player to another when he is unable to use his roll to cover spaces in his city (and another player *can* use that roll to do so), it is possible for a player to win on his first turn. In that case the, payout for the multi-game series is limited to five counters.<br/><br/>Blackout appeared in both the traditional narrow box (folded board) and wide box (unfolded board) formats.<br/><br/>",

Instead of a simple path, however, the path crosses and intersects, often giving the adventurer choices, but sometimes forcing the adventurer into an undesirable path.  Adventurers collect survival gear, hire guides, deal with natives, and of course, challenge Taetsequama.  To win, they must steal the treasure from the native temple and then return to the start area.  However, once the treasure has been stolen from the temple, other players can steal the treasure by landing on the adventurer carrying it.<br/><br/>The instructions list three levels of play which add complexity for higher levels.  Some of the challenges involve rolling specific numbers on the dice -- &quot;Snake Eyes must be rolled within 10 tries.&quot;  Some  issues are decided based on the player's life experiences -- &quot;If you've seen 'Dumbo', go to the south elephant walk.  If not, go to the north elephant walk.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The game is actually a trivia game for the most part with over 200 cards with questions and assignments.<br/><br/>The action takes place on a board representing the island of Curacao, home base of the Academy, and features several basins where you can teach your dolphins new tricks and collect fish.<br/><br/>There's a little extra for (beginner) puzzle fans: The board is divided in 13 pieces, with a large dolphin-picture on the back, making the game also usable as an old fashioned puzzle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the intro:<br/><br/>&quot;Rattenkrieg&quot; is designed as a stand alone game system that allows players to recreate fighting in built up areas during the Second World War. However, because it is based on the popular, tried and tested 'Kampfgruppe' series it is also compatible with the rest of Dropwing's World War Two titles, allowing scenarios of infinite variety to be created.<br/><br/>Urban fighting is held by many to be one of the most challenging aspects of modern warfare and this is equally reflected by the challenge of representing such combat on the war games table. This volume enables various types of infantry and vehicles to test their mettle against some of the unique situations to be encountered whilst fighting in built up areas.<br/><br/>Some of the most significant battles of the Second World War were fought in urban surroundings, such as Berlin, the Warsaw Uprising and perhaps most notably Stalingrad. However, it should also be remembered that, in addition to such epic and historically significant encounters, countless smaller actions took place within the towns and villages along the paths of advance made at all stages of the war. The prime purpose of &quot;Rattenkrieg&quot; is to enable this style of combat, along with its unique atmosphere and challenges, to be recreated on the tabletop.<br/><br/>Special procedures are presented to incorporate sniper duels, sewer fighters and tank hunting teams, in addition to more mainstream combatants. Ready reference sheets are printed on facing pages and due to the comb binding the book can be opened flat to speed up play by having all of the main procedures available at a glance.<br/><br/>&quot;Rattenkrieg&quot; also includes a scenario based on an historical event, which can be used to introduce new players to the game as well as form a basis for experiment with various aspects of the game.<br/><br/>",

All you need to do is fly out to the border planets and sell them. However, the Hands of Blue are in pursuit!

They won&rsquo;t fly 86 million miles for a box of band-aids, will they? <br/>In this game you try to fly 86 million miles through space to escape the Hands of Blue. But you must be wary, because your competition is doing the same and will tip off your enemies to your location (by playing cards to stop or slow you down), of course, you can do the same! <br/>In the basic game, designed for 4 players, the object is to be the first crew to accumulate $5000 in platinum (that is the point system) over several rounds of play. In doing so, you must try to complete a trip of exactly 86 million miles in each round of play.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When speaking of &lsquo;The battle of Alamein&rsquo; it is generally assumed that one is referring to the battle which finally saw Britain&rsquo;s Eighth Army defeat Rommel&rsquo;s much vaunted Panzerarmee Afrika in October/November 1942. However this was, in fact, the third battle fought at the Alamein position over a period of five months. The second battle, sometimes referred to as the &lsquo;Battle of Alam Halfa&rsquo; or &lsquo;Rommel&rsquo;s last dash&rsquo;, is seen as a necessary holding action which blunted the offensive capability of the Axis forces. The &lsquo;First Battle of Alamein&rsquo; or &lsquo;July Battles&rsquo; which concerns us presently has been given a comparatively negligent amount of historical attention; at times referenced as a hideously complex standstill or fatuously dismissed as insignificant. However, it was this battle which put a stop to Rommel&rsquo;s gallop to Alexandria and began the change in Eighth Army&rsquo;s fortunes that would eventually lead it to victory in November 1942.<br/><br/>The game map is a simple reproduction of the battle field of El Alamein in North Africa, from the Mediterranean Sea in the North to the impassable Qattara Depression in the South.<br/><br/>The Commonwealth player controls the units on the board which are Light Blue.<br/>German Units are represented in Grey, and Italian units are represented in Green.<br/><br/>",

Alternatively, you may wish to try your hand at the turning point of the battle and see if you repeat or change history.  Historically, the Romans won this battle after heavy fighting but can you recreate history or will you lead the forces of Philip V to victory over Rome?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was created by a couple of ubergeeks (of the software development variety) for other geeks. You can (as of this typing Feb 16 2007) read more about it at<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://oopsla.acm.org/OOPSLA02/ap/files/tut-32.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://oopsla.acm.org/OOPSLA02/ap/files/tut-32.html</a><br/><br/>Contents: one dice, two map sheets, a guide for the GM, and room descriptions/pictures for the players.<br/><br/>It's sort of a cross between zendo and a ridiculously light RPG. One person is the GM (or &quot;Pattern Master&quot;) and describes what the other players in the room see. Everyone else in the room cooperates as the group explores a dungeon and earns keys by solving riddles together.<br/><br/>The riddles are usually of the form &quot;You enter the next room and see these few objects.&quot; Players then suggest things to do to investigate the objects and their interactions. The GM tells them what happens as they explore. Eventualy the players regonize the software development pattern for which these objects are a metaphor.<br/><br/>The game was created for a conference attended by software developers and presumably has limited appeal outside that group, as few others would ever be able to identify the metaphor, having never read about software development patterns.<br/><br/>",

According to the rules of the game: the exclamation point column is to be identified as the &quot;Halleluiah&quot; column. Another difference is that the moderator does not simply call out squares to be covered on the player's card, but will indicate a column and read a question from one of five question cards. If you know the answer and have the answer on your card, then you cover that square. For instance, the moderator might say: &quot;Column A. Who killed Goliath?&quot; If you have David in your card's Column A, you would cover it. The free square is known in this game as &quot;Free Salvation by Jesus.&quot; The first player to complete a horizontal, vertical or diagonal row calls out &quot;Amen!&quot; and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

No score is given if player fails to answer question after three tries.  <br/>Starting player selects the first question appearing on the top row of the card, takes his turn and scores accordingly. Next player takes the next question appearing on the top row and proceeds in the same manner. Players continue across row after row, each player taking a new question whether or not his predecessor has answered the previous question correctly.   When all questions on the card have been used, a new card is put in the box and play continues.  Highest score for all six cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Dice rolls determine movement. You can jump single enemies (except uphill) and flip them over to become yours. A piece landing on the summit becomes a Field Marshal, which cannot be jumped but may leap and convert entire rows of enemies. However, there can only be one Field Marshal, whose allegiance proves difficult to retain; it must vacate the sacred peak immediately, allowing others to reach it and wrest control. Things can get hectic, but patiently blocking upwardly mobile forces in order to keep the fickle Field Marshal loyal usually wins. Still, this is a feisty game that can literally be enjoyed at all levels.<br/><br/>",
