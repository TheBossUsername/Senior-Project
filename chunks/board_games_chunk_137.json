        "description": "Stunde Null is the German language equivalent of &quot;zero hour&quot;, a term taken from military planning that indicates the beginning of some operation or event. In Germany, Stunde Null has a particular reference: midnight on May 8, 1945, when the capitulation of the Nazi forces' high command came into effect, marking the end of World War II in Europe. The period immediately thereafter became known as the Nachkriegszeit (&quot;time after the war&quot;).<br/><br/>In this game, the players asume the role of the reconstruction of Germany after the World War II, managing action cards, construction cards and event cards, that come into play using dices.

        "description": "Life is Card is a deceptively simple social card game where everyone playing decides on a scenario and goal and then proceeds to attempt to complete it using six fundamental actions. A game can last from five minutes to an hour and is appropriate for most ages.<br/><br/>The game can be played cooperatively using one person as the antagonist or, more commonly, competitively.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The players collectively decide on a scenario that includes a goal and a limitation or two (the rule book describes several scenarios). They then draw six cards and pick one to play all at the same time, action order resolves by the numbers printed on the cards from highest to lowest with each player describing their action. The next turn all players pass their cards to the player on the left and draw back up to six. A winner is determined when the scenario is either completed or impossible to finish.<br/><br/>Cards: The six action cards are Grab, Use, Position, Plan, Rest, and Delay<br/>  Grab: You pick something up, pull something down, restrain something, etc. Anything having to do with grabbing.<br/>  Position: Anything related to movement: yourself, a shopping cart, your laser pistol. You can only position something you already have in your possession or grabbed earlier in the game.<br/>  Use: Activating something, whether or not it is the item's primary intention. Turning on a stove, throwing a grenade, pushing that shiny red button.<br/>  Plan: Just like a wild card, you can use a Plan to pull any card out of the draw pile and immediately use it. The card you drew keeps the number from the &ldquo;Plan&rdquo; card for action order.<br/>  Rest: This card does not have numbers. Leave this card in front of you, sit back, and relax this turn while the others blunder away. On any later turn, you may discard this card to play two from your hand (be sure to draw back up to six cards). These two additional cards still adhere to the action order based on their numbers.    <br/>  Delay: These cards also do not have numbers. If you play one, you can pick someone to delay their action until they are last in the action order after they have stated their action. You may also play another action card. You cannot Delay a Rest and you cannot play another Delay card as your additional action card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Da Scramble Pidgin Crossword Game is a tile-laying word game using the Pidgin language, particularly as spoken in Hawaii. A pile of letter tiles is placed face-down on the table. Each player in turn rolls two six-sided dice, takes that many letters from the pile, and tries to make a Pidgin word or phrase from them. All drawn tiles are kept face-up. If unable to place a word, the player passes his or her turn to the next player who rolls, collects letters and tries to lay down a word. Once a word is laid down, all words must connect in crossword fashion similar to Scrabble. Although tiles may not be moved once played, players may steal tiles from other players to complete words or phrases (but be careful! This can help them). The game ends when all letters have been drawn and either one player plays his or her last letter or no more words can be made by any player. The player with the fewest tiles left wins. The game comes with a small pamphlet-size Pidgin dictionary, but players are encourage to use their knowledge of the language to settle disputes.<br/><br/>The game comes packaged in a cardboard tube.<br/><br/>",

The land where all the stories told at your bedtime came to life, where all your favourite childhood heroes and all those fearful villains coexisted in harmony.  But with His Majesty&rsquo;s sudden disappearance, this once tranquil kingdom was thrown into chaos.<br/><br/>Forgotten Kingdom provides players with a unique and fully customizable gameplay, with a rule set that allows for shorter and longer games.  Certain character combinations YOU choose compliment each other by enhancing their abilities.  This provides a different and challenging gameplay experiance each time.<br/><br/>Before you begin, ensure that each player recieves an equal set of identical cards. Each player takes their deck of characters and shuffles them, drawing eight cards. During each turn of the game, players will assign a character from their hand, placing it face down on the table.<br/><br/>Players will simultaneously reveal their character. Each player resolves the forgotten ability (Discard) first, followed by their character ability in play. The player with the total power after the forgotten and character abilities are resolved, wins the round and adds ONE to the total points earned on the score tracker.  Both players discard their character to the forgotten and play begins again.<br/><br/>The first player to get the desired victory points decided on before the game begins wins!<br/><br/>",

The rise of cities out here is clearly on the event horizon, as ever-increasing numbers of &ldquo;civilized&rdquo; easterners move in. Yep, the old ways are about to end. Still, law and order largely remain in their formative years. Wanted posters circulate throughout the region, and bounty hunters are plentiful&hellip;.<br/><br/>In Bounty Hunter: 1881, you are one of these rough-and-tumble men. You&rsquo;ll obtain wanted posters and travel by train, stagecoach and on horseback to get to outlaws&rsquo; hideouts. Once located, you&rsquo;ll try to apprehend your quarry, by fair means or foul. Be aware, however, that bounty hunters start out with a bad reputation. If you bushwhack too many wrongdoers you&rsquo;ll be considered just as bad &mdash; or even worse. You&rsquo;ll also have to be careful when apprehending your prey, since most of them are quite capable of getting the draw on you! So saddle up, pard&rsquo;ner and let&rsquo;s make some money &mdash; bounty hunter style!<br/><br/>Game Play (simplified): After a quick setup, a player will choose one of several possible actions, usually selecting one of the three Travel cards on display at the bottom of the board, along with its associated bonus. These bonuses are, left to right: draw an Outlaw card, draw an On The Trail card, take a silver dollar from the display. Each type of card has a hand limit, and players may need to pay dollars in order to discard unwanted cards. Players travel to the location where an outlaw was last seen via Train cards, then play an On The Trail card along with the Travel shown cards on it to try to apprehend an Outlaw card in his hand, which is accomplished via rolls of the dice, and may be attempted by fair means or foul. If successful via the latter method, one or more Black Marks are taken, but there is a limit. Players can be wounded by their quarry and lose turns. The game ends when the Travel deck has been exhausted three times&ndash; so shuffle the discards after it runs out the first and second times. The rewards for the outlaws captured/ bushwhacked are totaled and $300 deducted from the player with more Black Marks. The player with the higher total wins.<br/><br/>",

Player interference to deplete the money of other players is encouraged.<br/><br/>Actions in the game can be completed in two ways- through rolling against the Game Master, or &quot;Johnson&quot;, or by drawing &quot;Kit Cards&quot;, fictional cure-all products.

The positive(or negative) effects of these attempts are described by the Johnson in a humorous fashion based on the numbers rolled or card drawn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wormhole! is a space themed board game for up to 8 players that turns the traditional rules of game play inside out. Everyone starts out at the edge of the board on a spiral track. Every turn you roll the dice, move closer to doom and draw a card. That card may be good, it may be bad, but it will certainly be unpleasant for someone. Red event cards go into effect immediately and may move you forward or back, swap you with the nearest ship or even make you take another turn. Blue mass cards are...mass cards. Mass is also the most common card type in the deck and comes in 25, 50, 75, and 100 unit variants. Mass is bad, because for every 100 mass you accumulate you have to roll another die on your turn. So if you&rsquo;ve got 300 mass sitting in front of you, you&rsquo;re rolling 4 dice every turn (that's your original die plus 3 more). And that&rsquo;s just not going to end well. Green action cards are like the red event cards, but you can hold onto them and use them at your discretion. Use one to send your highest mass card to the person behind you...or if you happen to be that person behind you can use a different one to dodge that mass and let it keep on heading back. There&rsquo;s even an action card that will let you skip your own turn! When a player inevitably reaches the center of the wormhole, they are out. Flung into the deepest recesses of time and space most likely. When that happens, they mix up their remaining action cards with their mass cards and each remaining player takes one at random (going in order along the track). Play continues until only one player is left on the board, allowing them to safely escape the wormhole and making them the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The Struggle for Portugal - Peninsular War III contains four battles in Portugal and Spain during 1811: Barrosa, Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro, and Albuera.<br/><br/>The Struggle for Portugal - Peninsular War III is one of the games from OSG's The Library of Napoleonic Battles series. Details on the series are below, as all the games share a common rules set and game system.<br/><br/>BATTLES SIMULATED<br/><br/>Barrosa, 5 March 1811<br/>A reduction in the besieging forces gave the garrison of Cadiz an opportunity to break out. Loading on to naval transports, they debarked at Tarifa and moved to engage the siege lines from the rear. The French, under the command of Marshal Victor, placed one division on the road to Cadiz, while his two remaining divisions fell on the single Anglo-Portuguese division under Sir Thomas Graham. Following a fierce battle, the British succeeded in routing the French but could not prevent their reoccupying their siege lines.<br/><br/>Fuentes de Onoro, 3 - 5 May 1811<br/>Wellington first secured Portugal and then set about re-taking the fortified frontier cities of Almeida, Badajoz, and Ciudad Rodrigo. Whilst Wellington besieged Almeida, Massena reformed his battered army and marched to relieve the French garrison in the city. Wellington chose to check the relief attempt at the small village of Fuentes de O&ntilde;oro.<br/><br/>La Albuera 16 May 1811<br/>Wellesley sent Sir William Beresford to retake the border town of Badajoz. Soult rapidly gathered a new army from Andalusia and, joining with the troops retreating before Beresford, he marched to relieve the siege. With the Spanish army under General Joaquin Blake approaching, he planned  to turn Beresford's flank and interpose his army between his position and the Spaniards. However, the Spaniards had already linked up with the Anglo-Portuguese corps, and his 24,000 troops now faced a combined Allied army 35,000 strong. The opposing armies met at the village of Albuera. Both sides suffered heavily in the ensuing struggle and the French eventually withdrew on 18 May.<br/><br/>DESCRIPTION<br/><br/>The Library of Napoleonic Battles - formerly known as the Napoleon's Last Battles (NLB) Series:<br/><br/><br/>     480 meters per hex, <br/>     1 hour per turn, <br/>     400-800 men per strength point. <br/><br/><br/>Each Approach to Battle game lasts about 22 turns. The Full campaign links the individual battles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is essentially a modified deck of traditional playing cards, but featuring cartoon parodies of popular rap artists.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of 12 cards from the deck, and a game lasts 12 rounds. The player to the left of the dealer goes first.<br/><br/>Each round the top card of the deck is revealed, and the color of that card becomes the &quot;trump&quot; color. Each player plays a card from their hand of the trump color if they can. If the player does not have a card in the trump color he may play any card. The round ends when each player has played a card. If trump colored cards have been played, then the highest trump colored card played that round wins. If no trump colored cards were played, then the highest card of any color wins.<br/><br/>The winner of the round scores 10 points. The first player to score 187 points or higher is the winner of the game.<br/><br/>(It should be noted that, since a game only lasts 12 rounds and players only score 10 points for a round, it is impossible to score the required number of points in a game to win)<br/><br/>",

The goal is to reach the apex of the temple - Heryshaf&rsquo;s Inner Sanctum!  But beware!  For the temple is filled with traps, and the passageways are winding!<br/><br/>At the start of the game, choose one of the five cards at the base of the pyramid to start the path.  Each turn take the token representing your character and move it onto a card.    The token may only move to a new card if the room you are in has a path which leads to that card and the card you are moving to has a corresponding path.  When you attempt to move to a new card, flip the card over and sees what effects are activated.  There are both traps and helper cards you may find inside the temple.  You may choose to backtrack, but if you do, one card on the board is discarded, and a new unknown card takes its place - which may help or hinder you later.<br/><br/>The player wins if they make it through the temple, avoiding the traps or disarming the traps, to arrive safely at Heryshaf's Inner Sanctum.<br/><br/>This game tied for first place in the 24 hour contest for September 2014.<br/><br/>",

Players secretly indicate the location they are moving to by marking it on a 'location indicator' disc. The game involves deduction (working out which location a player has chosen to move to). The game uses a vinyl game 'board' and was sold in a round plastic box made to look like a film canister. The game is marked 'X certificate', but that appears to relate to the adult-only classification of the source movie rather than game itself.<br/><br/>",

In the LCD tradition, they are perfect for those wanting a game that is fast to learn and quick to play. These games will include all new graphics, corrected errata, and consolidated rules.<br/><br/><br/>     The Battle of White Mountain (November 8 1620) was an early battle in the Thirty Years' War in which an army of 30,000 Bohemians and mercenaries were defeated by 27,000 men of the combined armies of Spain, the Holy Roman Empire, and the German Catholic League.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The Battle of Fleurus (August 29, 1622) was fought between a Spanish army of 8,000 men, and the Protestant Powers of the Holy Roman Empire with an army of 14,000 men. The bloody struggle left the Protestants mangled and the Spanish masters of the field.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The Battle of Lutter (27 August 1626) took place between nearly equal the forces (20,000 each) of the Lower Saxon Circle, combining mostly Protestant states, and led by its Circle Colonel Christian IV of Denmark, and the forces of the Catholic League.  The battle resulted in a heavy defeat of Christian IV's troops by those of Emperor Ferdinand II, led by the Catholic League general Johan Tzerclaes, Count of Tilly.<br/><br/><br/>",

You will roll out with your trucks (6-sided dice) by flicking them onto the board, knocking over any buildings (stacks of wooden discs) in their path. Once your truck comes to rest on the city board, you  spend action points to drive around the board, collecting rubble from destroyed buildings for materials you will subsequently use to construct your own buildings.<br/><br/>Gameplay and strategy in Rubble Rousers is driven by hands of contract cards which can be played as either demolition contracts or construction contracts. If your card is played as a demolition contract, you earn Victory Points by toppling a building in the city that contains the materials listed on the card. If your card is played as a construction contract, you earn VP by building a structure that contains the materials listed on the card. Be careful, however, because if you are unable to complete your contracts within two rounds of play, you will lose VP instead!<br/><br/>Special bonus action cards can be activated to allow you to re-roll unsatisfactory rolls, perform rule-bending actions, dump unwanted contracts and more. However, once they are used, you must spend action points in later turns in order to maintain them and restore them to active status, ensuring you gain the end of game VP bonuses listed on the cards.<br/><br/>A crowd-drawing game of exciting shots and near-misses as well as careful planning and strategy, Rubble Rousers bridges the gaps between players of all sorts of games.<br/><br/>",

Players draft dice to determine their tolerance level and carefully play from their hand hoping to duck under the judgement of their family.<br/><br/>In game terms, players each start with a hand of seven cards and a d4, d6 and d10 is placed in a shared pool (The Bar) for each player; cards range from 1-10 in four suits with three ?!?!? cards in each suit.<br/><br/>In a round, each player completes one turn. On a turn, a player takes up to three dice from The Bar, rolls them to determine the current Tolerance value, then plays as many cards as desired from their hand as long as each card is less than the Tolerance value. If a player has no such cards, they can draw the top card and play it; if it's equal to or higher than Tolerance, they bust and lose all their cards. If they play a card equal to 8 or higher, opponents can play as many ?!?!? cards as they want of the same suit.<br/><br/>After all cards have been played, the player scores points equal to the number of cards played multiplied by the number of dice rolled, then subtracts ten points for each ?!?!? card played. Finally, the active player refills their hand to seven cards.<br/><br/>After each player has had a turn, return all dice to The Bar, then start a new round. When the last card has been drawn from the deck, finish the round. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

If they have collected enough head parts to complete a head (with or without the bonus cards), they may place the assembled head face-up in front of them.<br/><br/>Once a head it is played on the table, no cards can be added to it or any of its cards changed. At the end of a players turn; if they have more than seven cards, they must discard down to seven cards.<br/><br/>The numbers in the upper corner of the ear cards help determine if the ears are matching and if the are right side up - as it is possible to use a left ear upside down to finish a head.<br/><br/>Play continues until all the cards from the draw deck and discard deck are empty; or until no player can complete any additional potato heads. Then using the scoring table below, add up all the points for each player and determine a winner.<br/><br/>In case of a tie, the player who has used the most bonus cards is the winner. And if still a tie, the player who was able to use the most item cards wins. After that it is a shared victory of Spud Heads!<br/><br/>Final Scoring:<br/><br/>+ 10 Points    Each complete Spud Head<br/><br/>+5 Points    With matching ears<br/><br/>+ 15 Points    With hat, feet and matching item for hat<br/><br/>+5 Points    With hat and feet<br/><br/>+ 2 Points    With hat or feet<br/><br/>-2 Points    For each ear placed upside down<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alien Crash Site is a family friendly, 2 - 4 player co-op game for ages 12+. Play lasts about 60 minutes.<br/><br/>A UFO has crashed in the middle of the board and Aliens are pouring out! On the outskirts of town stand your Nuke plant, Water reservoir, Hospital, and Communications tower. If the Aliens destroy some of these key locations, it's 'game over'!<br/><br/>In order to prevent this from happening you will need to work together to unveil ultra high tech defenses, devise master strategies, build and command forces, and - hopefully - gain access to the ultimate weapon!<br/><br/>Unlike other co-op games, each player controls only 1 section of the board. There will be times of calm and times of sheer panic during play.<br/><br/>",

Collect gold by completing objectives, play tricks on your opponents, surprise them with smoke bombs. Keep an eye on the resources in your hand otherwise, you might find the next mission is out of your reach.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, a mission is revealed and aloud for all to hear, including objectives and any secondary objectives if available. Then each player draws 2 cards from the NINJA DECK in order. Now the mission phase begins.<br/><br/>Starting with the first player, each player must choose to place a card from their hand face down into play directly in front of them or pass and draw a card from the NINJA DECK.<br/><br/>After a player has performed one of these two actions their turn is over, if they have over 10 cards in their hand they must discard down to 10 cards. They may also immediately play surprise cards to get their hand size down.<br/><br/>Play continues around the table until either, one player has 5 cards in front of them when the FIRST PLAYER is about to START their NEXT turn or All players have passed in succession.<br/><br/>Players reveal their cards and compare scores against the mission requirements, the winner claims the mission and the gold for their clan.<br/><br/>",

When a company exploits its employees in illegal ways, it is called a black kigyou. Karoshi (death from overwork) is one of the most tragic results caused by such a company.<br/><br/>This game is a roll-and-move game with a theme of labor survival.<br/><br/>Players are new employees of a &quot;black company&quot;. When employed, they are willing to work for that company with full motivation, but their motivation will diminish soon. Each turn, the current player rolls a die and advances their pawn that number of squares around the board. Then, depending on the square that player landed on, a trouble or a disaster may happen, reducing that player's motivation (and sometimes other player's too). A player wins the game if all the other players' motivations are reduced to zero.<br/><br/>Players' way to advance is actually a loop because there's no way out of the company.

You form four-letter words by pairing up word bit cards or tiles from your hand and/or from the supply pool in the middle of the table. Word bits are fixed two-letter combinations that can form words when combined correctly.<br/><br/>Examples:<br/><br/>WO   +   RD   = WORD<br/><br/>PL   +   AY   = PLAY<br/><br/>It takes two word bits to form a word, and you must use all of your cards/tiles. At any time and as often as you want, you can discard any unwanted word bit by putting the card/tile face up in the pool and picking up a new or discarded one. Go fast; up to a dozen others are forming words at the same time as you!<br/><br/>It doesn&rsquo;t matter if you are a BUNNY, RABBIT, HARE, or JACKRABBIT! When skill levels differ greatly, level the playing field by using the skill cards which are numbered from 1 (beginner) to 8 (expert). The number in one&rsquo;s card is the number of words one has to form.  Less experienced players can win because they need to form fewer words. Whoever finishes first gets the carrot!<br/><br/>And the more you win, the harder it gets to keep winning!  After winning a carrot, your target number of words goes up by one for the next round.<br/><br/>Players leading during a game have to work harder for the next carrot, and so the others always have a good chance of catching up. The game is never over until the last carrot has been won.<br/><br/>",

Thrones and Bones is played on a 9&times;9 board, and shares the layout of the King's Table version of Hnefatafl. In general, movement and captures are handled as they are in Hnefatafl. However, this game adds a few new elements.  The attackers, known as the Draug, have a special &quot;leader&quot; piece known as The Black Draug, who has special movement powers.  Also, the starting squares of the attackers, known as the barrow mounds, are impassible to the Jarl and his defenders and also impassible to the Draug minions once they leave the barrow mounds. Only the Black Draug can move to any space on the board with no restrictions.  However, the Black Draug is also vulnerable. If he is captured, all his minions are released and Jarl and his defenders win. The Jarl may also win by reaching any edge square other than those in the barrow mounds. As in Hnefatafl, the Draug win by capturing the Jarl by surrounding him on all four sides with Draug pieces or barrow mound squares.<br/><br/>",

Each player aims to get their own colour letters into their &lsquo;Home&rsquo; Scrump zone of the same colour. Using typical crossword play techniques, each player endeavours to build words in their own homeward direction.<br/><br/>The moment a player (say yellow) has entered their own Yellow (&ldquo;Home&rdquo;) Scrump zone, two actions come into play:<br/><br/>Firstly, the player entering their &ldquo;Home&rdquo; Scrump zone begins to score points immediately, by multiplying the point value of each letter tile placed in the &ldquo;Home&rdquo; Scrump zone by the value shown on the side of their &ldquo;Home&rdquo; Scrump zone grid (1 to 7).<br/>Secondly, this player is now permitted to &ldquo;Scrump&rdquo; up to any two letters from anywhere in the central 15 x 15 board (you can even &lsquo;Scrump&rsquo; your own letters). Any &lsquo;Scrumped&rsquo; letters must be used in that turn. It does not matter if words are broken up as a result of the &lsquo;Scrump&rsquo;. However, it is part of the fiendish plan to frustrate you opponent(s) by scrumping their letters to stop them getting to their &ldquo;Home&rdquo; Scrump zone. By doing this, they cannot score, and they cannot Scrump your letters until they are &ldquo;Home&rdquo;.<br/>Any player reaching the &ldquo;Apex Star&rdquo; 7, finishes the game. All the other players must then deduct from their score, the value of the letter tiles remaining in their racks. The winner of the game will be the player who has the highest score &ndash; not necessarily the player who finishes the game. To player a full match each player must have one turn at starting a game. A match consists of one game (turn to start) for each of the 2, 3 or 4 players.<br/><br/>",

Buildings Downtown deliver greater returns, but they also cost more to build. Players build both Businesses and Cultural Institutions. You can choose to build alone or in conjunction with other players.<br/><br/>Businesses generate Cash, and Cultural Institutions generate Mojo. You'll need both to acquire City Council seats, which are how you get building permits.<br/><br/>Along the way, you'll also acquire Event Cards that will help you build or upgrade your Businesses and Cultural Institutions, impair those of your opponents, or influence the City Council and Building Permits.<br/><br/>Once the city's population reaches 1,000,000, the player with the most Mojo wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This cardgame plays a lot like &quot;Werewolves of Miller's Hollow&quot;, but with a twist.<br/><br/>The settings is the wild west, in a town called Tombstone. Two outlaws and a wannabe outlaw are hidden amongst the cowboys, and each night they kill an innocent cowboy. Their goal is to bring down the number of cowboys untill they outnumber them. But each morning the cowboys gather and hang someone, hoping to eliminate the outlaws.<br/><br/>Each player is secretly assigned a role : you may be the sheriff, the barber, the doctor, the priest or the hero. You can hide this identity, but if you want to use your special ability (like healing a shot person if you are the doctor, of taking the confession of another player if you are the priest) then you need to reveal your card. Of course, this is a risk if the outlaws consider you dangerous.<br/><br/>Unlike the werewolves, the outlaws can have a special character too. The priest, or even the hero, can be an outlaw. This makes the paranoia even bigger: when the cowboys decide to hang a person, why does the judge decide to let him free? Why doesn't the doctor heal the priest after being shot? This make the game much more intriguing. No more &quot;hey i'm a special character i'm innocent&quot;...<br/><br/>Another difference is that you can play the game with lesser persons. There are rules to play the game with up to 25 players, but slightly different rules to make it playable with 13-24 players, 4-12 players, and even 2-3 players. In the case of 4-12 players each player has more than one character, which means you are not eliminated out of the game as soon as one character dies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dueling tile game that's a cross between dominoes, consequences and certain pocket monster type franchises.<br/><br/>Build monsters from your hand of tiles and send them to destroy your opponent, crushing anything that is in the way. The first set contains three decks - bugs, bots and beasts that can normally only combine with themselves unless a &quot;combine&quot; card is used to cross the gene pools. Original Artwork from Tang Mu though templates are provided to go make your own sets and fight! Files are available for Print 'n' Play or laser cutting your own set.<br/><br/>With a starting hand of 7 tiles, players have 3 actions per turn, picking up, playing or attacking (can repeat the same action more than once to get to three) A monster can only be started with a head section and can only attack when it is completed with a tail. As many body tiles can be played in between these two providing that the symbols on the sides match (combine tiles come into play here). Each tile adds different features to the monster - a red dot/explosion means another d6 is added to the attack pool and a shield with a number in it is a hit point that can only be destroyed by an attack die with a number equal or higher than it. If all the hit points on a tile are destroyed then that tile is taken off the monster and put back into the bag. Players also have three hit points of their own health and are removed from the game when they are destroyed (they can choose which monster defends the attack or can take the damage themselves to keep their precious creations safe)<br/><br/>For extra silliness, when attacking the player has to shout the entire name of their monster (each tile has a portion on the side of it) leading to absurd and often hilarious monsters weighing into battle.<br/><br/>Greebles is published with a Creative Commons Attribution Non-commercial share alike licence as the creator is a great fan of collaboration. It was partly inspired by the drawing game consequences (or exquisite corpses if you went to art school :p) where a piece of paper is folded multiple times with a segment on a body drawn on each and then folded before passing to the next person so the final monster is only revealed when the paper is unfurled. There are blank templates available for the creation of your own sets and the author is planning on releasing official expansion packs as a way of showcasing other illustrators and ideas. A card game variant is also in the works.<br/><br/>",

Play then alternates as each player adds one of their cards to the table, creating a Fight Map of varying point values. Special abilities, combinations, and power ups may also be used to alter the Fight Map or achieve bonus points.<br/><br/>Once all Move List cards have been played, scores are tallied for the round. If a player has accumulated 60 or more points, they are are declared the winner. Otherwise, players construct a new Move List and begin another round. If neither player has accumulated 60 points after four rounds, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>",

To win this game the players have to move from one of the outher starting spaces to the center space. Movement is determined by two dice of which the player may chose one to make his move. The players move their meeples one space in the direction that matches their chosen die. <br/>If a meeple gets on a space that is already occupied by another meeple, the later one must start anew.<br/><br/>The game was published in the 1980s.<br/><br/>",

Imagine you and your friends each discovering eight pieces of 8 coins on a beach.  You know a treasure ship must lay offshore, with a treasure chest containing fabulous wealth.  The race is on to be the first one to reach the treasure and claim exclusive salvage rights. <br/>OBJECT...The object of the game is to become the first diver to reach the sunken treasure and return to the surface, thereby staking claim as the Legal Salvor.  Descent to the treasure is made by earning various levels of scuba certification.  Hazards about, and a knowledge of first aid and diving safety will help you reach the treasure safely.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Nerf Rebelle Disc Target Game was released as a toy included in McDonald's Happy Meals.  It is part of the Nerf Rebelle line, designed to appeal primarily to girls.<br/><br/>This game has a two-sided board and can be played in two ways.  One side of the board is a combination of a dexterity game and tic-tac-toe.  The board is laid out on the floor or a table and players take turns throwing plastic discs, trying to land them in one of the spaces on the 3x3 grid.  Players may of course knock other players' discs off the board.  Like tic-tac-toe, the first player to get three discs in a row wins.<br/><br/>The other side of the board is a target game.  Players take turns throwing their discs at the board, trying to land them in scoring circles.  Smaller circles have higher point values.  After each player has thrown all his or her discs, the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>Because the rules are minimal (and conveyed only with pictures), player will have to create house rules to answer lots of questions, such as whether players may pick up and rethrow discs if no one get three in a row in the tic-tac-toe version and how much of a disc must be inside a scoring circle to score points in the target game.<br/><br/>",

Soldier Emperor lets you play out the campaigns in Europe, while Indian Empires covers those in, you guessed it, India.<br/><br/>Soldier Emperor: Dreams of Empire is a 64-page book that brings those two games together, with a linking map covering the Persian Empire and the Central Asian khanates of Khiva, Kokand and Bokhara, plus some pieces of Afghanistan and other regions and new pieces to represent the armies and leaders of these distant lands.<br/><br/>The book also includes additional scenarios for each game. For Soldier Emperor, it's the war that would have broken out in 1815 had Napoleon not returned from Elba to re-unite his quarreling enemies. For Indian Empires, there's the 1760 Afghan-Maratha War, which resulted in the massive Battle of Panipat, and the Seven Years' War in India featuring the conquests of Robert Clive.<br/><br/>And there are more new variants for both Soldier Emperor and Indian Empires, like National Aspirations to give each power their own special victory conditions and special abilities for each major power. These make every country different to play, and not just because of their geographical position. There are new Imperial Power rules, and a whole assortment of additional special rules just because they make the games even more fun to play.<br/><br/>",

In this cooperative game, the players try to return and establish stable populations of each species to the wild.<br/><br/>All player's hands are seen only by them, but they cannot play cards from their own hand. Instead they must use the action cards to find out information about the cards held by other players, all while trying to avoid threats to the frogs and their habitats.<br/><br/>The game was developed and designed by 5D (in 2014), 6A (in 2015) and their teacher at Berwick Fields Primary School. Wanting to do something to help endangered frog species, the class launched a two-year learning journey and this game is the product of that. Along the way, the class was awarded the Zoos Victoria Love Your Locals 2014 winner for its work on the game and was inducted into the Zoos Victoria Hall of Fame for Young Wildlife Advocates of the year in 2015.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In American Dynasty you will play as one of the grand American political families: the Roosevelts, the Kennedys, the Bushes, or the Clintons. To assert your family&rsquo;s supremacy you will employ the time&shy;-honored tools of civic discourse, such as manipulation of the media, tactical legislation, calling in favors, back&shy;stabbing, stabbing, and the accumulation and distribution of money. You must build your political engine, sabotage your opponents, and bully and barter your way into the hearts and minds of the American electorate, ignorant of the closed door meetings, and deliberately impassioned by carefully orchestrated media events. By getting your candidates elected to congress, passing bills, and hopefully becoming president, you will crusade against your rival dynasties, sacrificing resources and morality in equal share. Anything, for the good of the family.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY: The game is played over the course of 5 Terms, and the goal of the game is to collect the most Electorals by the end of Term 5. Each term, players take turns taking 2 actions each (playing Core Action cards or Media Event cards, introducing Bills for voting, and other special) until an Election is triggered. In an Election, players with competing candidates roll dice and add on bonuses they prepared before the Election to determine winners of each vote. Winning candidates then take office and can vote on Bills and other issues. Electorals can be gained in multiple ways, including winning elections and passing bills. Negotiation, trades, bartering, bribes and table-talk are strongly encouraged.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ironsides is a moderate complexity game on the decisive battles of Oliver Cromwell and the &ldquo;Ironsides&rdquo; of the New Model Army at Preston in 1648 and Worcester in 1651 which won the Civil Wars and established the English Commonwealth. Philip Jelley uses the same area movement design as Lilliburlero: The Battle of the Boyne, July 1690 (ATO 40), with units representing the regiments and batteries that fought the battles. Each turn represents one or two hours of time, with weather and nightfall affecting command and control and unit activations. Scenarios are included for both battles with historical deployments, free-set-up, and for Preston a short introductory scenario and a three-day campaign game. There are optional rules for units that might have fought at the battles, and a random events table. Ironsides contains 216 counters, two maps (11&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; for Preston and 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; for Worcester) and a nine-page rulebook.<br/><br/>PRESTON 1648 King Charles I was defeated by Parliament in the First Civil War, but secretly made an Engagement with the Scottish Duke of Hamilton to restore him to the throne. John Lambert&rsquo;s 4,000 Parliamentarians could only slow Hamilton&rsquo;s 20,000 invading army as it joined 3,500 Royalists under Sir Marmaduke Langdale and marched through Lancashire. When Langdale encountered Lambert near Preston on 17 August 1648 it was dismissed as another delaying tactic, and Hamilton continued south across the River Ribble. What they did not know was that Oliver Cromwell had forced-marched 4,500 &ldquo;Ironsides&rdquo; of the New Model Army 300 miles to join Lambert. Langdale desperately tried to hold off the assault, but was overwhelmed, and Hamilton&rsquo;s divided and disorganised army was destroyed in a three-day running battle. With the Royalists defeated the Army purged Parliament so they could bring &ldquo;Charles Stuart, that man of blood, to an account for that blood he had shed&rdquo;.  His trial was a forgone conclusion and the King and Hamilton were beheaded.<br/><br/>WORCESTER 1651 In 1650 the Scots invited King Charles II to succeed his father, so Cromwell invaded Scotland, destroying their army at Dunbar and taking Edinburgh. Charles II raised a new army, but with little chance of victory in Scotland he slipped past Cromwell and marched south to Worcester, hoping to rally English Royalists to his cause. Cromwell followed, joining the county militias raised by Fleetwood and Harrison, marching on the 16,000 Royalists with 31,000 men, intent on a battle of annihilation that would end the Civil Wars for once and for all. On 3 September 1651 Cromwell crossed the River Severn with a bridge of boats, dividing his army in order to encircle the Royalist army. Charles seized his chance and attacked the militia east of the river, but was repulsed, and the Ironsides chased his army through the bloody streets of Worcester, killing 3,000 and taking 13,000 prisoners. Charles fled to France, famously hiding in an oak tree to escape capture, while Cromwell would overthrow Parliament and make himself Lord Protector.<br/><br/>&bull; Two Mapsheets (11&Prime;x34&Prime; and 17&rdquo;x22&rdquo;) <br/>&bull; One Countersheet (216 9/16&Prime; counters) <br/>&bull; One Rules Booklet <br/>&bull; Two Players Aid Charts (one for each player)<br/>&bull; Two Generals Display Charts (one for each side) <br/>Two six-sided dice are required to play the game, but are not included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "States Game is an educational dice game that teaches math skills and U.S. States. It is played with four six-sided dice, with the number one replaced by an outline of the United States.<br/><br/>States are numbered 1 to 50 based on their date of entry into the union. Each player picks a state, and then each player picks one state for each other player. In turn, players roll four dice, declaring which of their assigned states they're aiming for before they roll. Any United States pictures rolled are wild, and may be used as any number from 1 to 6. The player who rolled must then use any combination of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to achieve the target state's number. If the player is successful, he or she earns a point.<br/><br/>The number or rounds is equal to the number of players, and players may not try for a state they've already scored. After each player has taken all his or her turns, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>If the game is tied, all non-tied players choose a state. Each tied player has one roll to get the state's number. This continues until one player wins.<br/><br/>",

The teams can use body language, singing, humming, tell obscure stories, remind each other of past memories, speak unintelligibly, in numbers or form sentences that make no sense at all to the other teams &ndash;but hopefully passes information amongst themselves.<br/><br/>To call a murder, the teams will need crypto-communication, since callling a murder involves combining a murder scenario with a suspect, a location and a weapon as a team. However the other team(s) must be unaware of your selections since the solution could very well be stolen from you.<br/><br/>The game is loosely inspired by the English nursery rhyme &quot;Who Killed Cock Robin&quot; &ndash; especially Henry Louis Stephens&rsquo; 1865 book version which is named; &quot;Death and Burial of Poor Cock Robin&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The game is made up of 9 double-sided cards that consist of different sections of the race track. As you move around the track you will move these card section around to produce a full race track.  Each player has his own d6 and two tokens; one to represent his/her horse on the track and the other to represent the Jockey Boost token.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>[9 cards] - on [1] A4 letter size Double sided PDF sheet <br/>[1] - A4 Letter size Double sided PDF sheet - Rules<br/>[4] - d6 dice [1 Green, 1 Blue, 1 Yellow and 1 Red]<br/>[8] - Wood cubes - [2 Green, 2 Blue, 2 Yellow and 2 Red]<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>It's racing day is played in turns with each player rolling his/her d6 and moving his horse token the same number of spaces, as rolled on the d6, around the track.  The player with the lowest die roll moves his/her horse token first, which also means that player could roll the lowest die and still cross the finish line before a player with a higher dice roll!<br/><br/>On each turn a player can decide to use one of his two Jockey Boost actions, which would allow the player to reroll his/her d6.  If a player decides to take this action the move their Jockey Boost token on the 1st token space and rerolls their d6 die.  The player MUST use this new roll, even if it is less than the previous roll, to move his/her horse token around the track.  Each player is only allowed a maximum of two Jockey boosts per game.<br/><br/>CROSSING THE FINISH LINE:<br/>As the players get closer to the finish line each die roll becomes critical.  Since the player with the lowest die results moves first, this player could cross the finish line before a player who is closer but rolls a higher number!<br/><br/>If two or more players roll the same number they move there pieces at the same time.  If those two or more players can all cross the finish line with their die results, the player that is closest to the finish line will cross first followed by the next closest player and so on.<br/><br/>The BLUE player is one space away from winning.  The RED player is two spaces away from winning and the GREEN and YELLOW players are both three spaces away from winning.  The following dice results are rolled: BLUE=5, GREEN=3, RED =3, and YELLOW=1.  Since the YELLOW player rolled the lowest die roll he/she moves first but still doesn't cross the finish line.  Since the BLUE player rolled the highest die roll he moves last.  Now we come to the RED and GREEN players who both rolled 3, which means they move their horse tokens at the same time.  Since the RED player is one space closer to the finish line, he/she ends up crossing the finish line one length ahead of the GREEN player.  The results so far are RED player comes in 1st, the GREEN player comes in 2nd, and the BLUE and YELLOW players still need to take another turn to finish the race.<br/><br/>ADVANCED GAME PLAY:<br/>It's racing day can also be played with an ADVANCED race track layout by using the Hedge cards.  Hedge cards add an hazardous obstacle to the game.  Whenever a player tries to jump over a HEDGE space and they roll a 5 or 6, their speed is too fast, causing their horse to stumble and slow down.  The player must immediately stop their horse token directly beyond the hedge space and lose their next turn.   A player could avoid this roll by using their Jockey Boost action but if the second roll is low enough to prevent them from reaching the hedge, they would still have to roll again on the next turn to try and clear the hedge.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME:<br/>To win the game a player's horse token must be the first to pass the finish line before any other player!  As each player passed the finish line they will place their horse token in the corresponding winners box.  Each player continues to roll his d6 until he passes the finish line and his/her horse token is placed in one of the four winners boxes.<br/><br/>",

Play continues in this way.  If a player lands on a bone, he then spins the spinner again and moves that number of spaces.  If the arrow points to the puppy's head, he has to return to his doghouse.

        "description": "'Arby' is a game created by Neptune Meter Company and appears to be a sales/promotional tool extolling the benefits of one of their products (the ARB) that allows water meter readers to do their job electronically, automatically, and remotely.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/><br/>&quot;The ARBY game can be played by 2, 3, 4, or 5 players. One player is the ARB meter reader who reads the meters without entering the house; the others are conventional meter readers who must enter the house to obtain the reading. The playing board is arranged in four WATER DISTRICTS or routes of six houses each with the WATER OFFICE in the center where the game is started and finished. The goal of each player is to read all his meters and arrive back at the WATER OFFICE before the other reader (or readers). The ARB reader must read the meters in all 24 houses on the board; the conventional reader reads only six houses (or one fourth of the board).&quot;<br/><br/>The players all start in the Water Office where they each roll a die. The highest number is the ARB reader. The others choose their routes in order of the die number rolled.<br/><br/>When the ARB reader player reaches a dot outside a house they draw a card which will either give them the meter reading or present an obstacle. ARB player does not have to enter a house to get the reading. Once read they move on to next house.<br/><br/>When a conventional reader player reaches a dot outside a house they draw a card which will either allow them to enter the house or give them some reason they cannot. If allowed into the house they wait until their next turn and then rolls the die. If an EVEN number is rolled they put their pawn on the inside dot where they 'read' the meter by drawing another card which allows the reading or presents an obstacle. Once the meter is read player must roll an ODD number to exit the house. On the next turn they head to the next house.<br/><br/>This continues until a player reaches their quota (6 for conventional or 24 for ARB) at which point they race back to the WATER OFFICE. First one there by exact roll amount WINS.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>- Playing board<br/>- One die<br/>- Five meter reader characters, One ARB reader and Four conventional readers (pawns)<br/>- 24 Lockout Markers (plastic discs)<br/>- 30 matching colored cards for each conventional meter reader (18 large, 12 small - in 4 colors)<br/>- 24 white cards for the ARB meter reader<br/><br/>There is apparently a follow up game called 'Carby'.<br/><br/>",

Each turn players send one of their two survivors, each has a specific ability, into harm's way to gather supplies by pulling three random dice and rolling them. Each dice has four possible resource outcomes: food, protection, shelter, and scrap which can be converted and used by certain Survivors.<br/><br/>Survivors must then nullify the threats arrayed against them such as devastating weather breakouts which cause a wound for each resource not met. Roving bands of marauders that continue to come back on subsequent turns if not dealt with swiftly. Finally, the risen dead refuse to go down until all of the dead have their resources met.<br/><br/>To nullify threats Survivors must provide the resources required on each threat card either using rolled dice or Survivor card abilities. Deal with all the threats and take no wounds. Fail to deal with a threat and it injures one of your Survivors, which can cost you the game. Survive six turns with at least one Survivor still alive and you win the game!<br/><br/>Each version of the game supports up to four players so feel free to combine two games to have up to eight players fight for their survival!<br/><br/>",

Each turn they choose two of four possible actions in an attempt to get sets of four temples, prestige, or followers, while avoiding three mockery icons. The four possible actions are: Reroll any or all dice, add a random dice to dice pool, play Deity card, and Duel another player. Players cannot perform any action twice!<br/><br/>Getting and rolling dice is self explanatory, while playing a God card involves picking a target for the effect on the card, playing it and resolving the effect, and drawing a replacement card. Some cards have good effects while others have detrimental ones, but the only way to replace a God card is to play it.<br/><br/>Dueling involves both players rolling all of their dice, which is a nice way to ruin someones plans if they're showing three of a kind. The winner is the player with the most non-mockery icons showing and they get 1/2 of all the dice rounded up, keeping all the rolled faces, while the loser gets the remainder. This is a great way to get more dice if you only have a few and Duel someone with many, and if you win you can even grab a set of scoring dice from those rolled.<br/><br/>If at any time your dice show three or more mockery icons, immediately throw away all of your dice, draw three new dice, roll them, and end your turn. This includes Duels: When one or more players shows at least three Mockery icons during a duel, the duel is immediately canceled, each player retains their dice, and the player(s) showing 3+ mockery need to follow the steps at the beginning of this paragraph.<br/><br/>Scoring sets of dice occurs automatically at the end of a players turn and awards a single victory token. Get three victory tokens and your Ascend to Major God status and win!<br/><br/>Each version of the game supports up to four players so feel free to combine two games to have up to eight players fight for supremacy!<br/><br/>",

The overall goal is simple, be the first to gather three pieces of intelligence and dominate the Shadow War. To accomplish this task, players secretly target other players/nations and roll dice, which represent agents in an attempt to gather intelligence.<br/><br/>Players start the game with 1 Asset Die, 1 Ghost Die, and 1 Attack Die. All of these dice are identical except that they have one face that shows 2 x their specific type (i.e. Ghost die has a face with 2 x Ghost icons). They also start with one piece of Intel. The Intel goes on their Home nation card along with all dice.<br/><br/>Each turn players put some or all of their dice on a hidden target card of their choice. They then roll some or all of their Target card dice along with 0-5 World dice, which differ from the other dice by not having a double icon face and and extra blown cover icon...Expendable agents are very risky, but allow players with few dice to continue to play and be competitive. The goal is to get three icons of the same type, Assets, Ghosts, or Attacks, without getting three blown cover which forces players to reveal their target.<br/><br/>When players get three of a kind, they reveal their Target nation card, who then gets to defend. If the defense is unsuccessful, players steal an Intel token from the victim along with inflicting one other insult: 3 Ghost icons = No defense allowed; 3 Asset icons = Steal 1 die; 3 Attack icons = Kill one dice.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player with three Intel tokens. How will you deal with the myriad of threats arrayed against you and win the information war&hellip;the choice is yours!<br/><br/>",

Reo introduces a set of community dice used by all players to change the dynamic and allow customization of luck versus skill.<br/><br/>In all variants, players begin with five 8-sided dice each and a cup to keep their roll hidden from the other players. Players then take turns bidding according to the rules, until one player's bid is challenged.  The key to the game is using the results of your roll, probability, and your ability to read others to figure out what the best possible bid for that round is (the most number of dice with the highest number on them), and bid it first.  Challenges are resolved by revealing all the dice, as well as the community roll of 3 additional 8-sided dice that Reo adds.<br/><br/>The most popular version rolls the community dice after a bid is challenged.  This version emphasizes luck a little more, as a player can roll themselves out of a bid gone wrong jam.  The other popular variant rolls the community dice before the bidding, where all players can see the community dice for the &quot;Texas Hold' Em&quot; version.  Your bidding must be more precise when played this way, emphasizing skill versus luck. Any way you play, Reo is a fast-paced, fun game that is quick to pick up, and hard to put down!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BACKGROUND: THE UNION ABLAZE is semi-historical game of the American Civil War (1861-1865) in the East, also, referred to as the Peninsula. The Game begins shortly after the Confederate States of America (CSA) fired on the Union Fort Sumter. The Confederates are now building up their forces and gathering their Naval Squadrons to kick the Union out of the Southern States. The Union must build their Army and Naval Forces and capture Richmond and Petersburg along with enough key Confederate Settlements before the Confederates capture a number of key Union Settlements to force the Confederates to capitulate.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE: As the Commander of the Union Naval and Land Forces, you must gather your forces and naval squadrons to capture the Key Victory Point (VP) Confederate Settlements of Richmond and Petersburg (total of 9 VP), along with a number of other Key Confederate Settlements who&rsquo;s VP Values total 26 or more (for a grand total of 35 VP or more) before the Treaty of Appomattox Event Card is Drawn. If the Confederates control a number of Union Settlements worth 20VP or more, the Confederates win. Also, if the &ldquo;Treaty of Appomattox&rdquo; Card has been played and the Union does not control Richmond, Petersburg and an additional 26VP worth of Confederate Settlements, the Confederates win.<br/><br/>FEATURES: THE UNION ABLAZE features many colorful game counters, player aids and campaign cards. Units include Infantry, Cavalry, Artillery, Gatling Guns, Zouave Infantry, and Sharpshooters. There are, also, many Naval Vessels of the period including Ironclads, Screw-Sloops, Steam Cruisers and Torpedo Boats (including the Hunley). Game includes rules for Army and Naval Heroes that can help turn the tide of Battle with their leadership and fighting abilities.<br/><br/>Battles are resolved in a fast and fun manner resolved on colorful Battle Mats for both land and naval combat, providing the Player with a flavor of the period.<br/><br/>The UNION ABLAZE can be found at the following URL:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.berserkergames.net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.berserkergames.net</a><br/><br/>",

Play cards to your collection for points, or swap teams during your turn. At the end of the round, teams only score the points of the highest scoring player, so plan carefully!

We call this Team Chasing.<br/><br/>On your turn you have the opportunity to change which team you are on by playing cards from your hand. Choose your team wisely: some cards only let you swap cards with opponents, but you also score together with your team at the end of the round.

Cutting branches and grafting them onto the strong rootstock is one way to ensure longevity. Another benefit is pruning back some branches in order to propagate the growth of others. Water is also very essential because the tree will require the former and latter rainfall. Even though this all has a physical application of how to maintain a healthy tree, the Bible uses this concept to express spiritual lessons.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For those that want a little more of a challenge, this version of The Olive Tree is for you! This game focuses on learning timelines of the Biblical characters and Protestant Reformers that brought the church back into the truth of scripture. Have you ever wondered in what century was Job? Where in the Bible does it show what Martin Luther believed? Why was Jan Hus burned at the stake? All will be answered!<br/><br/>The Olive Tree Reformation is a co-operative Bible timeline game that reveals God's &quot;Spiritual Family Tree&quot;. Points are accumulated in the game by naming the correct character from the Branch card and connecting it to the correct level of Root or Vine cards. The game has 13 Timeline Rounds. Will you bear enough &quot;Fruit Points&quot; by the end of the 13th round?<br/><br/>REFORMERS<br/>In the 4th century most Christians began to lose sight of the original church's truths by means of creeping pagan compromise within their midst. In the Dark Ages the Bible and its truth was finally silenced and were instead replaced by the traditions of men. Only a select few were allowed to read from its pages and the common people were told it would be too much for their understanding.<br/><br/>Then stood up reformers in the church that read the Bible and uncovered its truth. These reformers showed that the Bible was meant for one and all, thus the gospel was spread once again. However by doing these acts some of the reformers were exiled, persecuted, or even executed by the hands of the church.<br/><br/>",

In far off America, citizens of both sides are concerned only with their basic survival and prosperity. Commerce and trading are bountiful, even, with the Indians. In the Frontier regions, hunters and trappers are gathering a variety of furs and pelts to sell and trade with the many Indian tribes, as well as, Europeans. As the clouds of war are brewing, brave heroes of the frontier will find themselves caught between making a living and serving their Countries; some will even become legends.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/>SAVAGE FRONTIER is a game for 1-4 Players. Each Player creates a Player Hero starting out in what will, hopefully be, a long and prosperous life in North American Colonies. During play, Player Heroes (Heroes) will conduct a variety of tasks such as hunting, trapping and trading. In the meantime, however, a war between France and Britain is going on and Heroes may find themselves pressed into Military service as Scouts or Militia for their Sovereign Countries. The surviving Hero with the most Legend Points at the end of the last turn is the Winner.<br/><br/>PLAY MECHANICS<br/>Players move their Hero Counters on a hex map representing a fictitious area along the New York and Canadian Border in order to complete a variety of assignments. Some special assignments are determined by drawing Assignment Cards. Assignment Challenges and Combat are resolved using Dice. Battles involving larger forces take place on a Battle Mat.<br/><br/>",

Who can reassemble and deliver more sandwiches?<br/><br/>Sandwich Mix-Up consists of forty &quot;bread slices&quot;, with twenty of these slices having raised areas that represent the sandwich fillings: cars, rubber ducks, butterflies &mdash; you know, the types of things that dogs would use in sandwiches. The other twenty slices have indentations that match the shape of the fillings.<br/><br/>To set up, lay out all the bread slices with the filling sides face up and the indentations face down. At the same time, players start taking the face down slices and feeling the indentations to try to identify which fillings belong to this slice. If they think they know, they can grab that filling slice to try to complete the sandwich. If correct, they keep it; if not, they return the filling to the table.<br/><br/>Whoever finishes the most sandwiches wins!<br/><br/>",

One player turns over an Eggspression card, then points to the face on the game board that matches this image. The next player covers this card with a card of their own, then points to the first face, then the second face. Players continue this way until someone can't remember the sequence and is penalized by placing all of the cards at the bottom of their stack. Whoever runs out of cards first wins.<br/><br/>In &quot;Laugh Out Loud&quot;, players use the same cards, but flip them to the other side, with each card showing something silly like &quot;Hee&quot;, &quot;Hoohoo&quot;, &quot;Woah&quot;, and so on. Gameplay works the same as above, but now players must repeat the chain of sounds.<br/><br/>In both games, sometimes a card presents the active player with a challenge, and the player must first complete this challenge prior to doing the memory test &mdash; and splitting your focus this way is tough!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Right to The White House is a comedic party game. Its cards are themed after the Republican 2016 primary debate. Each card includes a debate topic, a picture of a candidate, and a quote from a televised debate.<br/><br/>The game's starting tableau consists of a draw deck, a discard pile, and a hand of seven cards for each player. Players compete to be the first to discard all their cards, similar to Uno or Skip-Bo. Play proceeds in turns around a circle. Each player must discard or draw one card on his or her turn. Players can only discard a card if the debate topic marked on it matches the topic of the card on the top of the discard pile. When one player discards all their cards, each remaining player accrues points based on the number of cards left in their hand. The game is then reset and continues for three more rounds (or until one player's score exceeds an agreed maximum score).<br/><br/>Two special card types introduce a mechanic that requires all players to speak and act ultra-right wing at all times when playing. The Conservative Challenge cards allows one player to challenge another if they detect any behavior that is not sufficiently conservative (as judged by a vote of all other players). The loser of a Conservative Challenge must draw extra cards. A second special card, the Trump Card, allows players to automatically win any conservative challenge.<br/><br/>",

Then all of the players discuss why their choice, or another players choice is the &ldquo;worst&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Players decide which other player they think made the &ldquo;worst person&rdquo;, and award them their played card. The player with the most awarded cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Players will have fun playing their cards and laughing at the cards other players play. But the most fun comes from the hilarious discussions players will have about their choices.<br/><br/>The description on your card may not seem to be the worst at first, but a clever or creative explanation can make your description the worst.<br/><br/>Making funny matches with the cards is entertaining, but the group discussion of everyone&rsquo;s choices is where the game really becomes fun.<br/><br/>The games are fairly short if played for only 1 or 2 rounds. With short games, players can more easily leave or join the game. Short games also allow other players to join in easier.<br/><br/>The Worst Type of Person is available in 2 volumes at The Game Crafter for $19.99 each.<br/><br/>",

But be careful which groceries you allow your friends to take; it might be just what they need to beat you! And make sure you have enough money to purchase your groceries or you have to give them back.<br/><br/>Supermarket Shuffle takes card-drafting mechanisms and distills them into a 20-30 minute game that anyone can play. The dynamics of &quot;draft and pass&quot; are brought to the fore, while keeping the rules to a minimum.  As you see the first few hands of cards, you must quickly assess the make-up of the round and decide which type of groceries you'll go for. Then, each turn you'll need to weigh which cards to keep and which to pass on. The different scoring combinations allow for some clever plays and nasty blocks.<br/><br/>",

Players can hire heroes to hinder the opponent&rsquo;s exploration, but for that they will have to face enemy dungeons and their challenges, such as guardians and traps, built to protect the resources being processed inside.<br/><br/>So, the goal of each player is basically build dungeons by placing challenges over the table, and then trying to process resources inside. While keeping these resources protected against enemy invasions, the player will also want to disrupt the progress of the opponent, which is acquired by forming a party of heroes to raid the enemy dungeons. During invasions, six-sided dice are rolled to decide success or failure.<br/><br/>",

In this instance, in this world, it was called Windfall.<br/><br/>Windfall was the sudden manifestation of Aether &ndash; raw and unstable magical energy. Unleashed by the whim of the gods, it's presence has changed the world forever.<br/><br/>Windfall is a strategy card game for 2-4 players, where each player takes on the role of a powerful Guardian. These mighty individuals battle for control of the Aether using amazing spells, powerful relics and deadly creatures.<br/><br/>In Windfall, there are two primary ways to play. The first is the more casual Adventure Mode, where players will be playing from a shared group deck, making the best play out of the cards they are dealt. The more advanced mode of play is Drafting, where each game session starts with a unique drafting process before the players battle it out.<br/><br/>Each turn, as your power grows, you will summon creatures, equip weapons, harness ancient relics and cast deadly spells. Each player will battle the other guardians, reducing their life until only one remains standing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>All-Star Wrestling Rejects is a fast paced collectible card game that features a roster of six not-so-super stars competing for the coveted ASWR Championship Gold!<br/><br/>If you're on Offense your objective is to create a sequence of moves that inflicts maximum damage to your opponent and that will, eventually, lead to a pin. Each move (card played) deals a certain amount of damage to your opponent. You play a card by matching up the specific color with the appropriate side to the Transition Move (last Offensive card played). Be careful what move you play, as the higher the damage that is dealt, the more sides that are blacked out. With 48 different Offensive moves to unleash, every match is a unique challenge! On Defense? Then prepare to use your Block cards to limit the options on, and hopefully completely block off, your opponents offensive sequence. Or you could always play that Reverse card . . .<br/><br/>Throw Foreign Objects such as Kendo Sticks, Steel Chairs, Rubber Chickens, and Sporks into the mix to take your opponent out, but watch out! If your opponent plays a Referee Block card it could be game over. Each wrestler also has two Custom Finishers (for a total of 12 included in the game)! Can you survive The Hunchback Hillbilly's &quot;Hurrican-Moron-A&quot;, Abe Sherman's &quot;Hip Replacement&quot;, or The Bulkster's &quot;Leg Plop&quot;?<br/><br/>The Starter Set includes everything you need to begin playing immediately!<br/><br/>",

Join us to spy on your fellow diplomats and sell the information to the highest bidder, to persuade local leaders to support you in the upcoming elections, or to taste the glory of becoming champion of the arena&hellip; just make sure that, when the time comes, you&rsquo;re in the winning alliance&hellip;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jugger TTG: Dogskull Heroes is a tabletop board game simulation of a real-life modern sport which is based on a fictional gladiatorial sport featured in a 1980's cult movie, &quot;The Blood of Heroes&quot; (also known as &quot;The Salute of the Jugger&quot; and &quot;Salute to the Jugger&quot;).<br/><br/>The 1989 movie, &quot;The Blood of Heroes&quot;, filmed in Australia and starring Rutger Hauer portrays a post-apocalyptic world, similar to the Mad Max movies, in which the central focus of the bedraggled society is a brutal gladiatorial game called &quot;The Game&quot;. In this movie a rag-tag team of players, called &quot;Juggers&quot;, fight their way through the barren lands to earn the right to play in the big league of The Nine Cities.<br/><br/>The cult following of the movie saw the emergence of Jugger as a sport where the brutal weapons in the movie were replaced with padded foam weapons (also known as spars or pompfen). First emerging in Germany, Sport Jugger quickly spread through out Europe, Australia, and the Americas. So popular has the sport become that in 2014 the German World Masters Tournament, The Deutsche Meisterschaft, attracted 74 Jugger teams from across the world.<br/><br/>In 2015 Jugger fanatic and games designer, Stuart Shaw, took on the challenge of creating a tabletop board game by fusing his game system, Siostam, with modern Sport Jugger rules. The result is an exhilarating, fast paced action tabletop game, Jugger TTG: Dogskull Heroes, where you get to take charge of your own Jugger team and lead them to victory and glory against the best Jugger players in the world.<br/><br/>",

The idea is to capture the feel of games like Armored Core and Titan Fall on the tabletop while still having a system that is easy to get into but with depth for more immersive and challenging game play.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of Roller Pilots, customizing and preparing their Rollers for combat.  Each Roller (similar to a mech or power suit) is customizable allowing players to mix and match parts to suit their play style. The deluxe papercraft miniatures as well as the console/dashboard cards are configurable to match the build choices that the player makes.<br/><br/>During the game players allocate EN (energy) to different systems for offence, defense, movement, and initiative and are locked into those actions for the upcoming round.  As they take damage, they lose EN and their systems will go offline until they are no longer able to continue.<br/><br/>The starter set includes PDFs (letter sized) for the rule book, the Forest Map with obstacles, console cards with EN markers and 2D minis for 4 pre-configured Rollers and Pilots, sticker sheet for Action Dice, and parts and assembly instructions for the deluxe miniatures for the 4 pre-configured Rollers and Pilots.<br/><br/>",

Since emotions are the strongest feelings a person can have these are utilised to shape the environment to their favour.<br/><br/>There are three main Unique mechanics in Fervour:<br/><br/>1.    Single action turns: Just like in a real fight, initiative goes back and forth and you can guard, respond and counter. With one action per turn games are fast-paced and energetic and have multiple tactics available rather than always a single &ldquo;best play&rdquo;.<br/><br/>2.    Re-set every round: At the start of each round most of the cards on the field are re-shuffled and your hand is drawn again. This makes the game fast from the first turn of the game while still keeping it consistent.<br/><br/>3.    Each card is useful: Each card has an elemental ability. All cards you can&rsquo;t cast can be added to cards you can to buff them. So it doesn&rsquo;t matter if you can play all your cards or only one, both hands are good in their own way. Also when casting a card the top card of your deck is flipped and its elemental ability is added and if it&rsquo;s an emotion (your resources) then you play it and can use it on that turn.<br/><br/>",

The first player who calmed correctly may play a card that shares the same animal icon.<br/><br/>The player who has emptied their hand wins the game.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>ã´ã¼ã¢ã¦ãåã®<br/>ã«ã¼ãã²ã¼ã ã§ãåèª5æã®ææ­ã§ãã¬ã¤ãã¾ãã<br/>èªåã®æçªã§ã¯å ´æ­ã«å¯¾ãã¦ãåãæ°å­ããããã¯<br/>ã¤ãªãã£ã¦ããæ°å­ï¼å ´æ­ã2ãªã1ã3ï¼ã§ãã<br/>ã°åºããã¨ãã§ãã<br/>å ´ã®ã«ã¼ãã¨åãã¤ã©ã¹ããä»èªåã®åºããã«ã¼ã<br/>ã«ããã°ããã®ã¤ã©ã¹ãã®é³´ãå£°ãåºãã­ã°ãªãã¾<br/>ãããã¾ãä»ã®ãã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼ã¯ãã®é³´ãããã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼<br/>ããã¡æ©ãããããã¨ã§ãåãã¤ã©ã¹ãã®å¥ã£ã¦ã<br/>ãã«ã¼ãã1æåºããã¨ãåºæ¥ã¾ãã<br/>æåã«ææ­ãç¡ããããã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼ãåã¡ã¨ãªãã¾ãã<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Set in a dark fantasy world full of steampunk inventions and Lovecraftian horror, Battle for Nethervein invites player to take the role of one of the world's mighty heroes and fight for one of the factions to achieve total victory.<br/><br/>The game is heavily inspired by the computer MOBA genre, but it tries to take a modern and action-packed approach. Players divide into two teams, each fighting for either The Syndicate or The Swarm. During the game, you control only your hero, which gets stronger and gains new skills as the game goes on. Your actions influence what happens on the battlefield: You can fight on the frontline to push it to opposing towers to raze them down or fulfill quests around the board. The game focuses on fluid action gameplay and utilizes simultaneous movement-choosing and combat-planning so that you can bluff out your opponent. Enjoy an epic fight with up to five friends!<br/><br/>",

It was therefore given the order to enter the field. Divided into three columns, cavalry, infantry and artillery converged in the direction oi the Indian encampment.

Out of personal ambition he disregarded the orders ha had received and divided his regiment into three Columns without waiting for the main body of the army. As a matter of fact he wanted to surround the Indian camp with his regiment only. The Indians, led by Crazy Horse and Seated Bull, hindered the two side columns so that Custer was isolated in the middle.

Drivers dodge and bump as they compete for first position while the track thunders along beneath them. As well as opponents, keep a look out for the oncoming drone drivers and oil spills as you select high gear in your bid to win the Championship!<br/><br/>Grid Position uses a unique gameplay mechanic where the cars advance along the track comprised of a 4x5 grid by moving the drone and crashed cars backwards!<br/><br/>Each player moves their car one space either forward, back, left or right in turn order that is decided by a dice roll.  Each car has a corresponding coloured dice that are all rolled at once with the highest roll getting the first movement down to the lowest roll moving their car last. Cars also have a Low and a High gear with a forward move only allowed while in High gear and a back move lower your gear to Low.<br/><br/>After each car has moved all drone cars and any oil spills are moved one space backwards to give the illusion of the race cars moving forward along the track. The Black Race die thrown with the coloured dice adds these drone cars and oil spills when it rolls a 1,2,3 or 4(must match with a coloured die) with a 5 or 6 completing a Lap.<br/><br/>Players win the race by being at the front of the pack when Lap 7 is completed with a tie being decided with a Photo Finnish roll off between the tied cars. Winners receive a Trophy card for the race with seven trophies available through a Championship season. Player with the most trophies after seven races is crowned the Champion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/>In the year 1977, Atlantic produced, inside their 15 games-line called &ldquo;Il Gioco delle Battaglie&rdquo; (The Game of Battles), 5 &quot;board-wargames&quot; of the Old West/Indian Wars theme (code numbers from 1456 to 1460 in their catalog).<br/><br/>Each set included 1/72-HO scale toy soldiers, vehicles and accessories from Atlantic production, plus a different playing field game-map, related rules and historical introductory notes for every battle.<br/><br/>The game-maps (large pieces of paper of 68 for 68,5x49 cm) were photographs from above of 3D dioramas of hypothetical battlefields of the battles represented. On the back of the game-map sheets were shown the assembly diagrams for the parts contained in the package and the game rules, in four languages, with numerous illustrations for clarification.<br/><br/>The main fight rules were checkers/chess like: the player pieces must enter the enemy squares to eliminate his soldiers, with some hierarchical precedencies: e.g. no foot soldiers can eliminate horse-mounted ones. Non dice were used anywhere in the games.<br/><br/>From the publisher (Translated):<br/>Washita River - November 27, 1868<br/>General Phil Sheridan, who commanded the troops of Missouri, carried out many attacks against the hostile Indians. Among his officers there was Lieutenant-colonel George Armstrong Custer, who, out of insubordination, had been reintegrated in a lower rank under Sheridan's orders. On 26th November 1868 Custer set off at the<br/>head of his troops. The day after, at dawn, an Indian village on the Washita River was in view of the division. Custer surrounded the Cheyennes village and ordered the attack and spared nobody: the peaceful Indian tribe whose chief Black Kier had always trusted the whites was fully overwhelmed. It was an awlul massacre and no Indian escaped death. The women and children who escaped the slaughter where taken prisoners.<br/><br/>RULES<br/>HOW TO START THE GAME<br/>One of the two players keeps the Americans and the other keeps the Indians. The American player moves first, but initially the soldiers are placed outside the west side of the playing map. The Indians player goes second, but start with his pieces already on the squares on the east border of the map.<br/>HOW TO MOVE<br/>A) On each square the players may place from 1 to a max. of 4 soldier pieces.<br/>B) Each piece may be moved l square at a time.<br/>C) Each piece may move in a straight line only, never diagonally.<br/>D) Each turn each player can move only the pieces that start the turn on the same square: i.e., at each turn can be moved only the pieces of 1 square (one or more of them).<br/>E) Foot soldiers only (i.e.: no vehicles or horses) may enter the squares where there are houses.<br/>HOW TO ELIMINATE THE ENEMY<br/>A) In order to eliminate the enemy pieces it is necessary to enter the square where they stand.<br/>B) Foot soldiers con eliminate only other foot soldiers (e.g.: no horse mounted ones).<br/>C) All the enemy pieces in a square are eliminated even if only a single adversary piece enter the square.<br/>WHO WINS THE BATTLE<br/>The player who succeeds in eliminating all opposing forces is the winner of the battle.<br/><br/>",

All pieces can be jumped and jumps can be chained. Opposing pieces can only be captured once they have moved onto their color spaces.<br/><br/>The game can be played by two players, four players in partnerships, or four players individually. When playing with four the pieces are turned over to show numbers; pieces must end up on the spaces with matching numbers. The four-individuals game has a few extra rules about when pieces of the same color may be captured.<br/><br/>",

The actions are:<br/><br/>&bull; Play a Research Card: A player can put one of their Substance Card face down in front of them. At the beginning of their next turn, this card is revealed and its research ability is activated. Then the card should be discarded. You can never have more than one active Research Card.<br/><br/>&bull; Contribute to a Technology: Each player can contribute a card from their hand to two different Technologies. Any card can be contributed (Ingredient or Substance) as long as the resource of the card are correct with the resources needed in that Technology stage. Each Technology is being filled in order of their blueprint, from left to right. You play the cards face down and place your ownership token on the card.

Earn Action cards for your accomplishments and use them to dominate the highway as you become a truck driving legend!  Just be sure to steer clear of old smokey...<br/><br/>On each turn, a player rolls the Movement Die and optionally the Speeding Die if they wish to attempt speeding.  Speeding can allow for an extra Movement point per turn, but can cause wasted fuel trying to avoid the cops if they catch you.<br/><br/>The player may then split their Movement between physically moving road spaces on the map, refueling, and picking up or dropping off loads in cities.  Each road space costs 10% fuel and players are towed to the connected city of another player's choice if they run out of fuel.<br/><br/>Contracts offer incentives to deliver certain types of goods or travel to specific regions for bonus Fame.  Action cards spice up the game by creating risky scenarios for extra Fame such as Bar Brawls and Street Chicken.  Or, play devious deeds against your opponents such as shooting out their gas tanks and stealing their loads.  Naturally, all cards are flavored with classic 1970s CB jargon.<br/><br/>",

Movement is determined by a die. All players move clockwise around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns. Whenever a pawn arrives on a space as the result of a die-roll, it advances by the number of spaces shown on that space. If a pawn arrives on a red space, it advances into an inner ring. The pawns have to circle the innermost ring, till they manage to enter their &quot;Ziel&quot; section. Captured pawns are returned to their player's &quot;Start&quot; section. The winner is the first player to move all pawns into the &quot;Ziel&quot; section.<br/>This game was published about 1930.<br/><br/>",

To win the game, you must play cards and invest knowledge crystals. If you played well, you will then be able to level up at the beginning of your turn and acquire more power. Depending on the cards that you play, you will be able to use crystals of your opponents. If you reach mage level 5 or if you have eliminated all other players, you win.<br/><br/>WizArt is an exciting strategy card game with a lot of player interaction which is easy to learn but hard to master. It takes about 30 minutes to play and is suitable for players who are 8 years or older.<br/><br/>",

Obstacle tiles including corridors, pits, locked doors, and secret doors are added to the boards. The number depends on the game mode being played. Monsters are then added to the board.<br/><br/>Each player rolls a d10 for movement through squares that make up the dungeon boards. When they get to obstacles they must make an extra roll to get past them. Sometimes loosing a turn, or having to turn around and find another path. When players encounter monsters they must reference the Monster's card to see how to defeat them. Examples are an opposing roll of the the die, rolling an odd number, rolling 7 or higher. <br/><br/><br/>",

Who will defeat the most heroes and rein supreme... from jail when they get caught because... well... Superheroes are awesome like that.<br/><br/>Players get a hand of cards from which they will play or discard 2 per turn. For example minions, like Florence 'Hard Nut' McGee, could be placed on the field and players can start to create fiendishly clever weapons like the Poisonous Death Lamp. Alternatively they could play event cards such as the &quot;Publish a photo of your rival stroking a Kitten&quot; to reduce the fear gripping the city. Finally they could get bored and call up a Superhero to help the city... Then later use them for target practise. Superheroes start a set distance from the City and move closer after every round. If they reach the city they start to reduce the fear count which acts as the game timer.<br/><br/>Reducing fear and calling up Superheroes nets players kudos worth VP's at the end but defeating Superheroes earns you Capes which are worth more VP's and after all you are Mostly Evil.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules:<br/>Two people or a carload take the Olympic Trivia challenge. Test your knowledge by competing head-to-head with family and friends.  Learn how the Olympic Movement inspires everyone around the world in friendly competition.<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>In Travel Olympic Challenge, players take turns choosing a category of Olympic trivia (such as countries or events). The player must then choose to try for a bronze, silver or gold medal. The player is then read a question by another player. If trying for gold, the player must answer with no hints. For silver, the player must choose an answer from three choices. For bronze, only two choices are offered. A correct question wins the medal, which is marked on a scorecard. A player's turn ends after a correct or incorrect answer.<br/><br/>On subsequent turns, players may upgrade medals already won by answering another question from the same level already won (e.g. a second silver medal in a category upgrades the player to gold in that category). The first player to win a gold medal in all five categories wins.<br/><br/>To shorten the game, it may be played with a certain number of rounds or a time limit. In this case, gold, silver and bronze medals score 3, 2 and 1 points, respectively. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The ants stare in disbelief, for they know what that means.<br/><br/>Winter is coming.<br/><br/>With a wary glance, the ants retreat to their respective clans.  The fast approach of winter means food must be gathered, and as every ant knows, the clan that gathers the most food holds all the power in the Colony.  The race is on! Who will come out on top before the chill of winter sets in?<br/><br/>Autumn Ants is a game where 2 to 4 players take control of a clan of ants competing for control of their Colony.  Using a system of dice selection, players will explore the unknown meadow, gather seeds, build dirt walls to hold back their competitors, and maybe even build shrines to gain the blessings of their Ant-cestors! Hurry though, since winter comes sooner than any ant would like...<br/><br/>In Autumn Ants, players move their ant pawns around a randomly generated world, growing their ant colony to try to out compete their fellow players.  Each round, dice are rolled and each player will select one die.  This die will decide both turn order and a special action that can be used that round.  The player with the most food tokens brought back to their ant hill at game end will be the winner!<br/><br/>",

The game consists of a single sheet of thick paper with various punch-out elements that serve as the spinner, game pieces and 3-dimensional scenery. Play is standard for this type of game, with players moving along a track from start to finish, with some spaces that may move them forward or backward or cause gain or loss of a turn. Some spaces also call for the player to complete an action such as waving arms to chase away flies or pretending to swim across a river. Others feature animal facts.

There's so little cheese around, and mousetraps are everywhere! <br/> Not only that, enemy mice are afoot, armed to the teeth with crossbows, plasma grenades, shotguns, flamethrowers, bazookas, evil space lasers and a host of special powers! <br/> In the fast-paced card game Cheese Or Die, players take on the role of mice competing to horde the most cheese, whilst arming up in a bid to steal cheese from their opponents. Will you take your chances and draw from the Cheese Deck - a deck which becomes increasingly 'dangerous' as the game goes on - or play the long game by collecting weapons and bonuses, and smashing your rivals in combat?<br/><br/>To win, you'll need to be ruthless and pick your fights carefully.<br/> Oh, and avoid proximity mines...<br/><br/>In Cheese Or Die, the first player to collect 6 cheese cards wins... but this can be difficult! To do this, players can attack opponents by choosing a weapon card from their hand, adding any bonuses, and playing any number of special cards on top. Expect brutal fights with lots of surprises! Special cards allow you to alter the normal victory conditions of the game, or mess with your opponents' combat total, for example. Only if attackers win can they draw a card from the defender's cheese cards. Just don't draw a mine!<br/><br/>There's also the Cheese Deck, which has its own dynamics. Players can take a chance and draw directly from this deck, or set traps for their opponents by looking ahead and loading the deck.<br/><br/>All in all this is a fast, fun and tense card game that provides some hilarious moments! <br/><br/><br/>",

If pieces of both payers are on three connected spaces in a straight line, the minority piece is eliminated from play unless it is able to escape in the next turn.<br/><br/>There are rules for 2 variants included:<br/><br/>Buxelkuh: One cow has to break through a line of 9 peasants and 1 mayor. The latter try to trap the cow.<br/><br/>Buxtehu: The players try to get all 16 playing pieces to the opposite end of the game board. Each time a player gets one of his pieces to a space at the other end of the board, he may take one or more enemy pieces off the board. The game ends if all 11 spaces at one end of the board are occupied or if there ar no more pieces on the board. The player with the most captured pieces wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The player reads the question without comment and then chooses his or her answer and records it secret with the &quot;players choice wheel.&quot;  The other players may then discuss the question and then provide their answers to the question.  Finally, the current player reads the definition of the archetype and the &quot;correct&quot; answer (i.e. the one that corresponds best to the archetype).

The mirror was rumored to be a powerful magical artifact. But instead of granting wishes and riches, it shattered souls the instant someone glimpsed his or her reflection in it. No visitors come to the fayre anymore as it is a soulless place - and each of the seven proprietors also wants to leave, but as everyone of them has looked into the mirror, their souls are broken. They need to recover their ...or at least a ... complete soul before they can leave. To collect all 20 soul shards the players visit fayre attractions, play action cards, and take control of the attractions. However, there are more aggressive ways to acquire soul shards, as there are ways to just trade your soul shards with an opponent, whether he likes it or not. But beware: exchanging a soul is likely to drive you insane.<br/><br/>The Fayre is designed for two players, where it has a nice tactical level. But it is also fun for up to 5 players, where gambling and the ability to react to the present situation become more important. A soul exchange at the right moment can win or lose the game.<br/><br/>Nebil Abdulgadir, known from big computer game successes like Crysis as well as for his oil paintings in the art scene, is responsible for the great artwork in this game.<br/><br/>",

First across the river get the most flies, but the race last three heats.<br/><br/>Each player controls a frog, trying to get the frog safely across the river reaching the big pile of flies, while at the same time trying to prevent the other players reaching the same goal. The game is played over 3 heats, and whoever has done best overall wins the game.<br/><br/>Why don&rsquo;t the frogs just jump into the river and swim across? Because the river has a strong and unpredictable current, and to this day no frog has ever managed to swim across, and they have all been washed back to the shore furthest from the flies.<br/><br/>The board is build randomly for each game, with 25 out of 32 tiles. 5 of the remaining 7 tiles is placed by the players on the board, and thereby pushes out 5 other tiles, while at the same time the players tries to jump their frog across the river.<br/><br/>The object is therefore to optimize your own way across the river, and at the same time prevent the other players way across the river. Points can be used for extra power, and you have to judge whether to spend points in order to gain more points later in the game.<br/><br/>",

Conversion Go is a territory game for two players, Black and White, who alternately put stones of their color on the board.<br/><br/>2. The board is a 16x16 grid (counting the points rather than the squares). At the beginning the board is empty, with play taking place on the points.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlay3. A corner point is considered to belong to both edges that meet there.<br/><br/>4. It is permissible to pass. If both players pass consecutively, the game concludes.<br/><br/>5. It is not permissible to &quot;mirror&quot; the opponent's moves ten or more turns in succession.<br/><br/>6. The beginning of the game is governed by a &quot;refined&quot; pie rule. Player 1 plays two moves for Black and one move for White. One or more of those moves can be passes. Player 2 then decides which side to take, with White to move.<br/><br/>7. A group is a set of one or more like-colored, orthogonally adjacent stones. A liberty of a group is an empty point orthogonally adjacent to it. A dead group is a group that has no liberties and touches less than two sides of the board. To convert a group means to remove it from the board and replace it with stones of the opposite color. After a player's move, first all dead groups of the opponent's color are converted, then all dead groups of the player's color in the resulting position are converted.<br/><br/>8. The game concludes when both players pass consecutively. Any stones that cannot escape conversion are now automatically converted. Each player then figures his score, which is the number of his stones on the board plus the territory (vacant points) they surround. The player with the higher score wins.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesDespite the fact that stones are converted and re-converted, the game can be played neatly with pen-and-paper. The reason is that the color of any &quot;X&quot;ed stones is always clear: it is the color of the living formation which ultimately encloses them.<br/><br/>If played on an odd-sized board by players trying to win, the game will never end in a tie. Oddly enough, this is possible thanks to the fact that suicide moves are allowed, as this prevents local impasses (&quot;seki&quot;) with an odd number of points in them.<br/><br/>",

There are others, fellow captives, near you. And the dead, beneath you. At least, you hope they are dead.<br/><br/>You glance around to find the main gate, closed, and locked with a combination. Stumbling towards it, you notice a figure reaching through the gate. A dead man with a bloody note in his hand. You grab the note and see the clues. The clues to your survival and freedom.<br/><br/>A muffled scream breaks the silence.<br/><br/>You and your fellow captives dreadfully turn, hoping the source is not near. You grab the hanging lantern, and light it, revealing some headstones. The appear to be dirty and must be cleared to find the numbers to the combination.<br/><br/>Summoning courage, you step forward, but hear the bloodthirsty, muffled scream again. And again. It's getting closer.<br/><br/>Can you figure out the combination to the gate, before The Zombie Rises?<br/><br/>The Zombie Rises is a cooperative game, pitting you and your fellow captives against the Zombie. Working together, you must keep the Lantern lit and uncover graves to find the numbers to unlock the gate. Move quickly, collect tools, clear obstacles, and break into mausoleums, all with the goal of gaining your freedom.<br/><br/>But the deck is stacked against you. Pull The Zombie Rises card six times, and you&rsquo;re all dead. Guess the combination before then, and your lives are spared.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trail, copyright 1903 and 1904, is a card game where two to eight players represent hunters chasing a fox. There are 53 cards: four suits of 13 hounds (numbered 1 to 13 with a corresponding number of dog heads in circles) plus a single card with a red fox.<br/><br/>The red hounds are the trump suit. The fox is a red suit card, and beats any other red except the 10, 11, 12 or 13.<br/><br/>Players cut for deal, and the dealer passes out a number of cards based on the number of players, from 20 for two players to 6 when there are eight. After the deal, the rest of the deck is placed face down on the table and is known as the reserve pile.<br/><br/>The player to the left of the dealer plays a first card, which becomes the Trail card. Each other player must play a card of the same suit if possible, or any other card if he has none. The trick is taken by the highest card in the Trail suit unless overtaken by any red card, in which case the highest value red takes the trick.<br/><br/>The winner of the trick must discard one card from his hand and replace it with the one on top of the reserve pile. Once the reserve pile runs out, play continues until all cards in the hands have been exhausted.<br/><br/>All cards of 10 or higher in the trick, as well as all red cards, are placed in the &quot;kennel&quot; in front of the player and count for points.<br/><br/>The player holding the fox may play it at any time except as a Trail card. If the fox (which beats anything but 10-13 of red) wins the trick, that player gets five bonus points. If another player takes the trick with the fox by playing a high red, that players gets five points. If the Trail card is a red 10+, the fox must be played if held.<br/><br/>The fox is &quot;caught&quot; in the final count. Whichever player has the largest number of red hounds in his kennel (each card counting its number, i.e. the red 10 counts as 10 hounds, the red three as three) gets 10 points for catching the fox.<br/><br/>Each player then gets 4 points for each #13 card held, 3 for each #12, 2 for each #11 and 1 for each #10. This provides a maximum number of points available in a round as 55. This also is the number of points required to win the game, so a game usually consists of two or more rounds. <br/> The box also includes rules for six other games using the same cards: Chase, Dogon, Red Heads, Numbers, Word Building, and Finding a Sweetheart.<br/><br/>",

Enraged, the warriors of the Demon Head School attack the Jade Temple, killing its Master and beating its students mercilessly.  Some of the students, including the players, manage to escape into the Chinese countryside.<br/><br/>Players will need to heal themselves, train both physically and mentally, earn gold to acquire the weapons of Kung Fu, and raise their prestige in order to train with other masters and learn the secrets of Kung Fu styles.  But the warriors of the Demon Head School are trailing the students and will attack from time to time.  After nine years of training, a final showdown will occur.  One student will succumb to his wounds and die after the fight.  Of the survivors, only the student who has gained the most honor will emerge triumphant over the Demon Heads and re-establish the Jade Temple school as its new Master of Kung Fu.<br/><br/>The game begins with a draft of the supply and style cards.  The main element of the rest of the game is worker placement.  But there's a twist - there's only one &quot;worker&quot;, themselves, to place each round.  And instead of placing workers on action spaces, players place them BETWEEN action spaces to activate adjacent actions.  Plus, the action spaces themselves are modular and change order and frequency each round, creating an ever-changing environment that challenges players to use adaptive strategy to be successful.  Every three rounds, there is a Kingsburg-esque Attack Phase, in which players will use their acquired supplies and learned styles to defeat the enemies of their school.<br/><br/>",

The large cards are placed in the middle of the table with the main picture side up. The smaller cards are all dealt out to the players. The top large card is turned over revealing the character portrait and perhaps a number and/or symbol. The players race to see who can match these revealed items with pictures and/or symbols and/or numbers using the smaller cards in their hands. The first to do so claims the large card. The player with the most large cards wins.<br/><br/>The large cards can also be turned over and put together puzzle-fashion to make a group shot of the main characters from the movie.<br/><br/>And finally, the smaller cards can be used to play any regular card game.<br/><br/>",

The trades cards and items are distributed to the players. A narrator reads aloud a story contained in the rules booklet, and at each blank in the story looks at one of the players, who then turns over the top item in their stack and reads it aloud. It is a party game intended to provoke merriment.<br/><br/>The original version was published c. 1850 in London by J. Passmore as The Laughable Game of What D'Ye Buy? by Professor Punch, and featured 12 finely hand-colored engraved trades cards, 72 letterpress cards, and a 20-page booklet, all contained in a wooden box with an illustrated sliding lid.<br/><br/>Later versions were published by McLoughlin Brothers c. 1870 and in an &quot;improved&quot; version in the early 1900s. McLoughlin also published a simpler variant, What Do You Buy? with only eight trades &mdash; butcher, druggist, music store, furniture, fish market, bakery, dry goods and toy store &mdash; each with five items available. For example:<br/><br/>16: &quot;Wishing to have something new to wear at a dinner party Susette was to give, I tried on AN ACCORDIOON.<br/>17. Susette laughed, and said it fitted like A LUMP OF DOUGH.<br/>18. So instead I bought FIVE POUNDS OF TRIPE.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Word-O-Rama is a quiz or knowledge game for 3 or more players. Each player receives a pencil and a large pad printed with a 5x5 square. Like a bingo card, it has a &quot;free&quot; square in the middle, but there are spaces to the left for a vertical five-letter keyword, on top for 5 categories, and on the right for scoring.<br/><br/>The game box contains a spinner that goes from 1 to 75. To begin a game, the players make five spins to determine categories for the game. They spin one more time to determine the key word for the game. The rules include a table of 75 categories and 75 keywords.<br/><br/>The players then start a 10-minute hourglass-style timer. Within that time limit, they try to write down for each category an answer that begins with the corresponding letter of the keyword. The rules show as an example a game with the category &quot;animals&quot; in the first column and the keyword CARDS: correct answers could include &quot;camel&quot; on the first (C) line and &quot;dog&quot; on the fourth (D) line.<br/><br/>Players get 10 points for each valid answer, but only if it is unique. If two players pick the same word, they get 5 points each, and if three or more think alike, no one gets any points. Players get a bonus of 10 points for each fully completed vertical, horizontal or diagonal line on the card.<br/><br/>",

Roll them.<br/><br/>Rolling 1, 2, 3 means you can move your trick-or-treaters that number of spaces.<br/><br/>Rolling V1 or V2 allows you to move the vampires that number of spaces.<br/><br/>If the + side of the die is rolled, take a die from another player and roll it.<br/><br/>The opponent&rsquo;s die is treated differently than the player&rsquo;s own dice. 1, 2, 3 you move your opponent&rsquo;s trick-or-treater that number of spaces. You cannot move the opponent&rsquo;s t-o-t to the same space as a vampire.<br/><br/>If the V1 or V2 is rolled, your opponent gets to move a vampire. Vampires can only be moved once on your turn.<br/><br/>If the + is rolled it is treated the same as above.<br/><br/>WINNING<br/><br/>When all trick-or-treaters have been saved (made it to the center space) or killed by vampires, the game is over. The player with the most safe trick-or-treaters wins. Ties are possible.<br/><br/>It is also possible (though rare) that the vampires can win if no trick-or-traters make it to the center.<br/><br/>",

Choose the legs &amp; tails / torsos &amp; arms / head combination that you think will &quot;wow&quot; the judges.<br/><br/>But just like every pageant, you can try to play foul to get ahead. Players have chances to &quot;cheat&quot; and gain an advantage over their competition. Strategy and tactics come into play as you choose the right time and place for your devious deeds.<br/><br/>Players choose from a shared supply where 5 of each type of monster body part is available. As cards are selected they are removed from the supply. Once removed cards form a gap of 2 or more, these gaps are refilled from the respective decks of body parts. Players select enough cards to each put forward 3 contestants into the pageant, one for each of the three judging rounds. Each monster will have an overall value made up from the traits represented on each body part, for example: hairy legs (value 2) + spikey torso (value 3), and a head that&rsquo;s a little slimy (value 1) and a little hairy (value 1). Judges will give merit points to each monster based on their bias, and each judge is only interested in one trait. The first judging round is scored by one judge, two judges score the second round, and three judges score the third and final round.<br/><br/>The best monster in each judging round earns a player 3 points, with runners-up taking 2 points, good-looking losers earning 1 point, and everyone else 0 points!<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with 3 cheat tokens. These tokens can be spent during the pick phase to either: A) choose three cards on your turn instead of one, B) clear an entire row of cards, draw five more and then pick one, C) or take a peek at one of the judging cards to get information about what criteria will earns points during judging.<br/><br/>Any cheat tokens not spent during the picking phase are kept to the end of the game and earn the player an additional point towards their final score.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score at the end of the three judging rounds is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Four sages, drawn by a mysterious power, accidentally disrupt the harmony of the forces behind the manifest world. Unwittingly they freed a great and terrible power, Orono. The sages recognized their mistake, but were hastily locked away by the knights of the Kingdom. With no one left to stop Orono, the Ancient Forces who formed Axios, must now gain back the loyalty of their creation and return harmony to the kingdom.<br/><br/>In Unholy Upheaval players take the role of one of the 4 Ancient Forces of Axios. Using what limited resources they have, players must gain back the loyalty of their creation and take the power back from Orono. Whoever can acquire the most of Orono&rsquo;s fragments will take the place as the dominant force once harmony is returned to Axios.<br/><br/>The playstyle of Unholy Upheaval is deck-building with minor PvP elements. Each player starts with a starter set of 10 cards and 0 fragments. They utilize their starter cards to build a more powerful deck from a common pool of available cards, the Aether.<br/><br/>The playing take turns playing and purchasing cards. Each turn follows the followng structure:<br/>1. Check for any relic effects in your battlefield and perform their actions.<br/>2. Play cards from your hand. Each card will provide either resources (Loyalty, Rage, Fragments)or provide powerful effects. Play Minions to your battlefield face up, and Relics into your opponent&rsquo;s battlefields face up. Resolve all text on each card before playing another card.<br/>3. Use loyalty to acquire Minions and Relics from the Aether. Defeat Shards from the Aether with rage, and gather Fragments from the supply as indicated on each card.<br/>4. Once you have finished acquiring and defeating cards, place all Minion cards played this turn (that are not haunted) face up in your Discard Pile and draw 5 new cards from your deck (if you need to draw a card and cannot, simply shuffle your discard pile to create a new deck.)<br/><br/>Unholy Upheaval ends when the last Fragment is taken from the pool and the round is complete. This way every player has the same number of turns. Players can still earn Fragments after the last one is taken.<br/><br/>Each player counts the Fragments in their pool then adds that to fragment value of the cards in their deck. This number is represented by the fragment symbol in the upper right hand corner of Minions. Relics and Shards do not count towards your score at the end of the game. The player with the most total Fragments is the winner. In case of ties the player with the most relics in their deck is the winner<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Carpathia is a table top skirmish game for two or more players set in a dark fantasy world with steam-punk elements. Players take control of a party of heroes and adventurers on a common quest. The core game is designed to be played in around an hour depending on how large of a party you choose to hire. Before the start of the game, players agree on the amount of gold they will each spend on hiring and equipping their party.<br/><br/>You must first choose a hero to lead your party. Heroes are persons of great renown throughout Carpathia and the rest of the world. They are natural born leaders and usually excel at fighting, magic, or even crafting. Once you have hired your hero you can then recruit the rest of your party, purchase additional equipment for your adventurers, magic spells, or other items. The hero you choose will determine the alignment of your party. There are three alignments in Carpathia, good, neutral and evil. You may have guessed that if you hire a hero of the good alignment, you will not be able to hire adventurers that are evil. Neutral heroes can hire either good, neutral, or evil adventurers; although you cannot have both good and evil in the same party. Each of the 14 available factions in Carpathia is of one of the three alignments. Hiring your party entirely from the same faction gives you small stat bonuses. However, each faction also has a specific style of play. Some factions excel at magic, while others are expert warriors. Some are masters of deceit, while others are master tacticians and strategists. The ability to hire your party from multiple factions gives you the option to customize your play style.<br/><br/>Each character in Carpathia comes with his or her own stats, equipment, spells, and other items. All of this information will be found in the rulebook, as well as all the additional equipment you can purchase. Supplied with the rulebook, you will also receive a blank character sheet. This is what you will use to record your heroes and adventurer&rsquo;s statistics, equipment, spells, items and abilities. Not only will it make it easier to quickly look up character attributes during a game, but will also make it easier to change them, as they can often change during a game, or especially if you are playing a Quest.<br/><br/>Quests in Carpathia are a series of games. During each game your adventurers gain experience, acquire loot, and gatherer resources. However you must be careful because heroes and adventurers can also be hurt or even killed. In between games you will be able to apply gained experience towards new abilities, skills or to increase statistics. You will also be able to attempt to heal any hurt or wounded characters as long as your party possesses the necessary spells or potions required to do so. The loot, whether in the form of gold or items, can be used amongst your party, sold, or even traded to other players. Finally the resources found can also be sold or used to craft weapons, armor, or items if your adventurers possess the required skill sets. Our hope is that these features will add a level of emersion into the world of Carpathia and make the games more rewarding and fun. The Carpathia rulebook will have a number of Quests, but we also encourage players to develop their own.<br/><br/>Those who have played table top war games before will find the core rules of Carpathia familiar, while those new to war gaming should have no problem quickly picking them up. Each player will take their turn, in which he or she can move his or her adventurers, use items, cast spells, engage in combat, or hunt for treasure and resources. The game turn is divided into four Phases. First is The Action Phase, followed by The Movement Phase, then The Combat Phase, and finally The Magic Phase.<br/><br/>During The Action Phase you can activate certain items such as food or magic weapons, attempt to claim resources, or attempt to recover adventurers who have been knocked down or unconscious. During The Movement Phase you may move your adventurers, attempt to climb, jump, swim, or take cover. The Combat Phase is when both shooting and hand-to-hand combat is resolved. Finally The Magic Phase is where characters with any ability in manipulating the winds of magic can attempt to cast their spells. During phases in which you come in direct contact with your opponent, he or she will have the opportunity to retaliate if not otherwise incapacitated. For instance after you charge an enemy adventurer during your combat phase, but fail to either knock down, out, or kill him or her, your opponent will have an opportunity to retaliate with an attack of their own.<br/><br/>Our goal is to make individual games of Carpathia fast paced but also fun and engaging. The Quests are meant to provide further emersion and give players the ability to play out epic stories as they journey across Carpathia in search of honor, glory, treasure, knowledge, power, or the dark energies that inhabit it.<br/><br/>The Carpathia rules are based on a D6 system, and we recommend playing on a 4 foot by 4 foot playing surface. The main rulebook will include the complete rules, 6 quests, full rosters of heroes and adventurers for each of the 14 factions, lots of additional spells, items, weapons and equipment; resource counters, as well as blank character stat sheets. Also in the rulebook will be the full history of the world, as well as the background and history of each faction. Carpathia itself is only a portion of the greater game world. So far we have planned three expansions providing the success of Carpathia, which will explore other portions of the world, offer additional quests, characters, items, and content.<br/><br/>Our goal is to continuously release new miniatures to represent various heroes and adventurers, as well as introduce a guide for building your own characters in one of the planned expansions.<br/><br/>",

If they are correct, he then wins the &quot;Results&quot; card which is worth one point.

        "description": "As part of the Galactic Sciences Coalition fleet, several vessels&mdash;including your ship&mdash;have been experimenting on a mysterious black hole, NGC 7841, nicknamed Charybdis, for the last several weeks. It was a routine mission until those fools on the GSCV Narwhal miscalculated their hyperjump and disappeared into the event horizon!<br/><br/>Your ship&rsquo;s alarms scream danger: your instruments register a sudden and violent increase in the black hole&rsquo;s diameter. The black hole is relentlessly growing larger, and you are dangerously close!<br/><br/>You know you must leave before being gobbled up by the black hole, but your hyperjump drive is useless now that the event horizon is so close, and the gravity waves make your sub-light drive slow and unreliable. If you are to survive, you must escape using every means available to you. Think!<br/><br/>An idea springs to mind: Could you use your ship&rsquo;s powerful tractor beams to help pull yourself to safety? But what could you target with enough mass and momentum to make a difference?<br/><br/>As the inescapable answer washes over you, you set your jaw in resignation at what you must do. For years you&rsquo;ve worked closely with the crews on the other ships, and some of them are even close friends. But now, you order your crew to warm up the tractor beam emitters and target the ship ahead&hellip; It&rsquo;s everyone for themselves at the edge of forever.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>In Charybdis, you captain a ship and crew trying to escape from the orbit of a black hole that is relentlessly expanding. Your engines are affected by the singularity, so there is only one way to guarantee survival: by targeting other ships with your tractor beam to pull yourself to safety, while dragging them closer to their ultimate doom.<br/><br/>On each turn, you roll your Crew Dice, choosing which to keep and which to re-roll. Your goal is to create combos that allow you to assign your Crew to the various tasks aboard your Ship: manning the Helm (movement), maintaining the Fusion Generators (energy), or upgrading your Navigational Computer, Tractor Beam, or Shields.<br/><br/>You can use your Tractor Beam to steal dice from your opponents, which you roll on your turn in addition to your Crew Dice. These extra dice give you a boost while slowing down your unfortunate targets. You can even lock a Tractor Beam on nearby Asteroids, but watch out--Asteroids can trap you with their gravity and drag you closer to your doom.<br/><br/>After each player has a turn, Asteroids trapped in the Black Hole's gravity fall inward, and then the Event Horizon expands, potentially devouring your Ship and Crew.<br/><br/>Charybdis took 1st place for Best Artwork &amp; Graphic Design, 1st place for Best Written Rules, and 2nd place for Best Overall Design in the 2016 One-Page PNP Contest (see contest results).<br/><br/>",

Each character has a number of Life Points which equal to abilities within the game as well.  When they are wounded their life goes down which also reduces their abilities within the game.<br/><br/>Players complete their mission by surviving the game map (which is random apart from a few key elements that will always appear) and completing their mission objective by returning to their starting vehicle.<br/><br/>It maybe to retrieve something, destroy something or any manner of events.  These events are decided by the roll before gameplay beings of the Dice of Destiny which give a primary, secondary and bonus mission.<br/><br/>Equipment is varied and unique in some cases.  Players start with an amount of points that they can purchase equipment which they can carry and keep in the starting vehicle as this has capacity to store extra equipment.<br/><br/>The characters available are classic type heroes who range from spies to thieves. The single player can control two of these while co-op each player can only control one each.<br/><br/>The scene and era is pulp fiction / cult era and general classic caper / 70's film type scenario!!!<br/><br/>The missions are random generated and can include such types as:<br/><br/><br/>     Stop a doomsday device.<br/>     Save the husband of the bride.<br/>     Kill the undead allied zombies.<br/>     Replace the Six Million Pound's man bionic parts with lesser quality items.<br/>     Save Schr&ouml;dinger's cat.<br/>     Rob the safe.<br/>     Collect evidence.<br/><br/><br/>Everything you need to play the game apart from the dice will be included within the Print and Play rules that are free.<br/><br/>This game can be supplemented with additional furnishings and miniatures. The system allows for very easy expansion and 3rd party supplemental material.<br/><br/>The game also offers basic characters&rsquo; progression and surviving characters can be moved from one adventure to another.  This in essence means that you may benefit from equipment from a prior mission if you play wisely.<br/><br/>",

Your walk will take you through eight friendly neighborhoods, and there are plenty of interesting objects to explore and collect along the way: stones, insects, bottlecaps and such&mdash;pretty much anything you can stuff into your pockets. Stay out of the mud puddles, though, or your mom won&rsquo;t be happy with you when you get home.<br/><br/>For each round, one player rolls all the dice. Grandpa moves along the path automatically, then each player will have a choice of moves. It's good to maneuver yourself into going first, since that player will have first crack at snapping up objects, but he will also have to deduce what his opponent might do. Other considerations for both players include getting more different objects than their opponent, when to re-roll their dice, and the need to stay close to Grandpa. If you lag too far behind you'll have to entreat Grandpa to &quot;wait up!&quot;-- which will yield negative victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Light fun for kids and semi-serious gamers, Wait Up, Grandpa! provides 30 minutes of game time well-spent.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>  1 Game Board<br/>  5 Dice in three colors (2 blue, 2 red, 1 gray)<br/> 24 Object cubes in eight colors<br/> 10 &ldquo;Wait Up/Hurry Up, Grandpa!&rdquo; markers, double-sided<br/>  3 Mud puddle markers<br/>  2 Player tokens (1 blue, 1 red)<br/>  1 Grandpa token (gray)<br/><br/>",

The Flatow Chess Board is a 65 hexagon 8 x 4 x 4 hexagonal matrix, one more hexagon than the traditional 64 square matrix. The chess piece moves are intuitively and logically mapped by closely correlating adjacent and diagonal moves used by the traditional square Chess game. xChess has 2 openings, the Flatow opening can be played using a traditional set of pieces, having 2 bishops (all on the same diagonal grid) and the Fortress opening having 3 bishops (one for each diagonal grid) per side. The Game was refined over 2 years of intensive exploratory play by Canberra Chess enthusiasts and was self-published in 1976 in Australia.<br/><br/>The Flatow Chess Board and openings present the neatest and most compact form of Hexagonal Chess and xChess is the combination of the best openings and pawn variations discovered over the years.<br/><br/>The X in xChess stands for HeXagon, eXtra dimension, eXtra power, eXtra possibilities, eXtra fun and X Factor.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets 100 dollars to spend on drafting a team of players.  The player card deck is shuffled and the first five cards are laid out.  Each player card is assigned a position, a set of statistics and a minimum bid amount.  The players draft a team of baseball players (at least nine, to fill every position, but bench players are encouraged) by bidding against each other.<br/><br/>Phase Two - The game.  Players field their teams and roll dice to determine the outcome of each at bat.  Play begins with a pitcher's roll, which is checked against a results chart.  Play then continues with a batter's roll and a fielder's roll (if necessary).  Play follows normal professional baseball rules.  The game can continue for either 3 or 9 innings.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Storm the Bridge, you play as both a leader in charge of a party of crew members and, sometimes, as writer able to change the narrative. You will recruit crew members (some better than others), sabotage other players (all in the name of peace, of course), and fight for control of ship sections (sorry, no holodeck). Action is cut-throat, a well-played card can change the direction of the game, and in the end, only one leader will arise as the new captain of the FSS Polemus.<br/><br/>Storm the Bridge is completely card-based, with 14 oversized cards (nine leaders and five ship sections) and 140 poker-size cards (35 crew members and 105 action cards). Players use their leaders to recruit crew members, and then use the leaders and crew members to recruit better crew and attack ship sections, while using action cards to add bonuses, sabotage the other player, modify crew members, and more. The goal is to control the Bridge ship section card and two other ship sections, then use the Bridge's unique ability - Victory!<br/><br/>",

One deck is of five letter words, the other of seven letter words. The active player looks at the word at the top of a card that is drawn from the deck of his choice. The rest of the card is hidden. He then either (i) begins naming the word's anagrams that may be hidden on the card, or (ii) says &quot;Strudel&quot; if he believes the word has no anagrams. He tips his timer to its side when he is finished naming anagrams or when he says Strudel and then re-starts it on his next turn. Players advance on a score track for each anagram they name and for each correct Strudel. They are penalized for incorrect Strudels. The winner is the first to the end of the score track or the furthest along when the timers all have run out.<br/><br/>",

The concept is incredibly simple -- one player (acting as a judge) draws a random card containing a fill in the blank sentence in the target language and the other players play a card containing a noun from their hand. The player who has played the sentence card then chooses the best card played and that player scores a point. Play continues with that player as the new judge.<br/><br/>All VERBA players benefit from seeing high frequency words, with many repetitions, in a context that fosters authentic learning and comprehensible input. As with all of The Pericles Group's educational games, the play objectives and the learning objectives are one in the same. Players win by making comprehensible sentences, scaffolded by the cards, the images, and the helpful hints included on the sentence cards. We always want to ensure that the learners are seeing correct forms and those forms are continually reinforced by the mechanics.<br/><br/>This is a core set specially tailored for novice level Chinese learners and works great in or out of the classroom!<br/><br/>",

This deadly game of chance will not only test your luck, but your nerves as well.<br/><br/>Each round, the dealer deals face-up a card to each player from the deck. If the card is a Click, the player will stay alive and continue in the round, but if it is a Bang!, the player has gotten shot and must leave the round with no points. Each Click card will also contain the number of points won by the player who posses it. The play continues in a clockwise fashion with each player deciding whether they will like to collect their points and exit the round, or risk their lives with a new card for the possibility of getting more points. Once all the players have either chosen to leave or have been shot, the points are tallied, the deck is shuffled, and the next round begins. The first player to 50 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>Eat or Eaten is a two-player abstract game with a theme of hares struggling for feeding ground. On a 5x6 square grid board, players have five hare tiles each. Their goal is to capture four of their opponent's hares or to occupy their opponent's burrow for one turn. There are three types of hares, which determine their movement directions allowed, and each type has a flip side that alters its direction. You may flip your tile by consuming one turn, or moving into a special square.<br/><br/>This intellectual game is suitable for those who began to enjoy thinking.<br/><br/>There are two editions of the game. The original Version was produced for the Spring 2015 Tokyo Game Market (TGM). Each TGM, designers are invited to face a challenge, to design a game under certain conditions. This is where the &yen;500 microgames came from, which included Love Letter. The Spring 2015 TGM challenge was '2ç¨®ã«ã¼ãã²ã¼ä¼ç»' which was to bring games using only two types of cards. The first edition of Eat Or Eaten was produced to satisfy the 2ç¨®ã«ã¼ãã²ã¼ä¼ç» challenge. The components were only cards and the field was only 3 x 4 square. The Hares behaved differently between editions too. In the first edition, when a Hare was flipped over, it changed the power relationship with opponents' Hares, leading to a fourway stand-off. In the second edition, produced for the Autumn 2015 TGM, the Hares have equal power, but flipping a Hare changes the way it moves. In both Versions, the Hares are competing for food.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>ãããã®é¤å ´äºãããã¼ãã«ãããäºäººç¨ã®ã¢ãã¹ãã©ã¯ãã²ã¼ã ã§ããï¼å¹ã®ããããä½¿ã£ã¦äºããç¸æã®å·£ç©´ãã¹ã«ï¼ã¿ã¼ã³çã¾ãããç¸æã®ããããï¼å¹ã«ããã¨åå©ãã¾ããé§ã¯è£è¿ããã¨ã«ãã£ã¦ãåãæ¹ãå¤åãã¾ããé ­ããã£ããã¨ä½¿ãã²ã¼ã ã§ãèãããã¨ãæ¥½ãããªã£ã¦ããæ¹ã«ããããã§ãã<br/><br/>",

This results in the first and last rows having only 6 spaces instead of the usual 8. Each player has 6 tiles numbered 1-6 which are placed on the first and last row in numbered order.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he rolls 6 dice to determine which pieces may move and by how many spaces. To begin with, pieces may only move sideways, forward, or forward diagonally, but may not move backwards.<br/><br/>If a piece is adjacent to an opponent's piece, it can be jumped in a Checkers fashion and removed from the game. Once a piece reaches the opponent's starting row, it becomes a king and can now move backwards.<br/><br/>The first player to eliminate all of his opponent's pieces from the game is the Winner.<br/><br/>",

Choose one of four Heroes and collect Promotion Points to crawl your way to the promotion you've always wanted. But be careful! Your co-workers and Bosses will want to knock you down a peg.<br/><br/>The main goal of the game is to have the most Promotion Points (PP) after either the defeat of the required number of Bosses or when the deck has been played through once. PP has another purpose, however: it is also player's currency, allowing them to purchase equipment, items, and companion creatures to boost their stats and stand a chance against whatever stands in their way.<br/><br/>Players choose their Hero Card at the beginning of the game, each representing an entry level position in the Office. From there, they encounter creatures, loot, and the dreaded Instant cards as they work their way through the 90-card deck. A simple, stat-based combat system and the ability to make your own shady backroom deals between players facilitate quick, competitive play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "According to the publisher, this educational card game is &quot;designed to improve vocabularies, improve spelling and provide profitable entertainment&quot;. The game consists of a pack of 72 cards, each of which bears a single letter of the alphabet in large print. The deck has between one and six cards of any given letter.<br/><br/>Six cards are dealt to each player. The dealer begins by playing one of his cards and announcing a word starting with that letter. Subsequent players must play the next letter in a word on the board if they can, or start a new word if they cannot. They then draw a card from the deck to replace the one played.<br/><br/>After each player has had a chance to play on a word that has been announced, subsequent players may change the announced word to any other that word that includes in order the letters already played.<br/><br/>Players get points for completing words, ranging from 5 points for a 2-letter word to a maximum of 1,000 points for a 10-letter word. Each time a player takes a trick by completing a word, he may also &quot;declare&quot; another word for which he has all the necessary letters in his hand. He scores for that word as well, and then ends his turn as usual by drawing a card. Winner is first to 2,000 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A very straightforward yet strategic deckbuilding campaign game with Civilization theme.<br/><br/>Players start with the same set of 12 cards representing their Stoneage tribe and keep developing their society, card after card. The game can be played in two modes:<br/><br/>Campaign mode: After the first game (Era I) players score their points and set their decks aside. The next time they'll play, each player is going to start with his own old deck and new cards will be available in the market (cards from Era II). After 5 games (5 eras), the player with the highest sum of points is the winner.<br/><br/>Fast mode: Use less copies of each card; players play a one-shot game purchasing cards from the market and refilling it with cards of the next eras. The player with the highest sum of points at the end of this single game is the winner.<br/><br/>The game mechanics are both similar and different from the original Dominion; basically, players can play a card and purchase a card from the market, as in Dominion. However, the market is a row of cards instead of different deck containing the same card in multiple copies. Moreover, there aren't the usual coins or victory point cards. Each card has a point value, an effect, a cost, a colour, and can be discarded from hand together with other cards of the same colour to purchase a new card from the market. There are Leaders and Wonders too; Leaders are multicolour and have powerful effects while Wonders can be purchased at any time and they provide more ways to score extra points or other bonuses. Keep them separated from your deck.<br/><br/>In the campaign mode: players choose and obtain a Leader at the end of each game, with the player with the highest score being the first to choose. Wonders can be purchased at any time (max. 1 per Era) in place of a card of the market, and players keep all their Wonders until the end of the 5 eras.<br/><br/>",

Order 8, for instance, includes Prunes, Oatmeal, Cloves, Chicago Yeast Powder and Mustard.<br/><br/>This game has two distinct features. First, the order sets vary both in size and point value. The ten orders include four of 3 cards worth 5 points if completed, three of 4 cards worth 10 points, two of 5 cards worth 15 points, and one of 6 cards worth 20 points.<br/><br/>More importantly, the game has an educational focus. Each card lists three facts about the title ingredient, and three key words related to the facts on each other ingredient card in the order. If player A asks player B for the card &quot;Citron&quot; and B holds it, B says &quot;What of It?&quot; and A must then provide one of the three facts about Citron before taking the card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1908 card game published in Philadelphia is based on the rivalry between Cornell, Princeton, Yale and University of Pennsylvania. The 60-card deck is divided into four suits of 15, each representing one of the four colleges. In addition to being numbered from 1 to 15, each suit contains cards with letters spelling out the name of its college. The object of the game is to complete the name of one of the four colleges using only the letters from its suit.<br/><br/>Players are dealt five cards each, and five more go face-up on the field between them. Each player on his turn has the opportunity to capture cards on the field by playing a card that adds up to the same number (e.g. a 13 can be played to capture a 9 and 4). He plays until unable to capture any more, and then adds one of the cards from his hand to the field. When a player exhausts his hand, he gets a new hand of five cards.<br/><br/>Players must declare which college they are playing for, and if there is competition for one, the first player to get the 15 of that suit takes over and the other player must go after a different college.<br/><br/>Letter cards of the desired college are placed in front of the player as successfully used or captured, and the remaining cards go into a discard stack which becomes the replacement deck when needed. While two colleges have only four letters (PENN and YALE), the values of the letter cards ensure that each college is as hard to complete as the others (e.g. PENN has letter cards of 12, 13, 14 and 15, while PRINCETON includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 15).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The fascinating boardgame&quot;<br/><br/>Abstract race game played with tetrahedral pieces on a hexagonal board divided into six large equilateral triangle regions, each of which is subdivided into 25 equilateral triangles which are the movement spaces. The centre triangle in each of the 6 larger triangles regions is marked with a letter of the alphabet (A through F), each of which is the starting and finishing space for one of the players.<br/><br/>The six playing pieces are tetrahedrons, each with one face in each of the colours; red, blue, white and orange. All 6 pieces have the same colour sequence, but are distinguished by each face being marked with the letter (A to E) corresponding to the start/finishing space to which it pertains<br/><br/>In each game, 3 of the spaces (except the start/finish space) in each region are marked with one of the colours; red, blue or orange. The players must move from their own starting spaces, to tag all the spaces of a particular colour and return to their own starting space to finish.<br/><br/>The game can be played with each player required to make three laps of the boar,d once tagging ll the red spaces, then all the blue then all the orange. Alternatively players race the same coloured track as their opponent opposite in each round (e.g. players A &amp; D race the red track, B &amp; E the blue, and C &amp; F the orange; then in rounds 2 &amp; 3, swap colours).<br/><br/>Pieces are moved by either <br/>a)rotating 120 degrees in place through a vertical axis (i.e. the face-down side remains face down), or <br/>b)by pivoting the piece along one of the three edges touching the board, so that it 'rolls' into one of the 3 spaces adjacent along one of the sides of the current space.<br/><br/>To enter (and tag) a coloured space, the colour of the face-down side must match that of the coloured space.<br/><br/>Each turn a player rotates his piece in place or moves to an adjoining triangular space. First player to complete the race around the predetermined course wins.<br/><br/>The game does not appear to have been published in a commercial version. Rather, an 18-page manual with hand-drawn line illustrations was produced in 1986 suggesting players make their own copy of the game for tabletop play, or even construct a giant set for outdoor use.<br/><br/>A 3-page supplement (Modified Tramid) was produced in 1987, with proposals to improve the quality of a manufactured board, and slight changes to the rules..<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Peekaboom is a fast and outrageously fun strategy game where you work with your partner to assemble and detonate your explosive device before your opponents can detonate theirs.<br/><br/>Sounds easy? Not so fast! You need to use secret signals to let your partner know when your device is ready to explode. Don&rsquo;t make it too obvious or you&rsquo;ll get caught. But if it&rsquo;s not obvious enough, your partner won&rsquo;t notice it&hellip; And don&rsquo;t forget to watch your opponents or you&rsquo;ll miss their secret signals!<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player gets a secret signal card, 3 explosives cards (the player's hand) and a stack of unknown explosives cards. To start a round, each player takes a card from the top of their stack and places it face up in the center of the table. Then the player tries to collect 3 of a kind by discarding a card from their hand and collecting one from the center of the table. There are no turns - players collect cards simultaneously. As soon as a player has 3 of a kind, he or she performs the secret signal described on the secret signal card (e.g. touch your nose, tap the table, etc...). If the player's partner sees the signal and shouts 'BOOM!' that team wins the round. If an opponent sees the signal and shouts 'SNIP!' the opponent's team wins the round. The first team to reach 10 points wins (7 points for a 6 player game).<br/><br/><br/>     Bluff! Send fake signals to make your opponents mistakenly say &lsquo;SNIP!&rsquo;. <br/>     Watch what explosives your opponents are collecting. Enjoy the look of surprise on their faces when you say &lsquo;SNIP!&rsquo; before they have even made their signal. <br/>     Alternatively, if you see an opponent collecting a particular explosive, grab it when it appears on the table before they manage to grab it themselves. <br/>     Even better, if you already have an opponent&rsquo;s card in your hand, play it and say &lsquo;SNIP!&rsquo; as soon as he or she picks it up. <br/>     You should also watch what your partner is collecting, maybe you have a card he or she can use. <br/>     Watch for players who aren&rsquo;t collecting any cards, they probably have collected 3 of a kind already. <br/>     Confuse your opponent by constantly dropping and collecting extra cards so that they can&rsquo;t see what explosives you are really collecting. <br/>     There are blank signal cards in the Signals deck. Make up your own signals. <br/>     For more advanced players - don&rsquo;t use the Signals deck at all! Each team makes up 3 Signals before the game and uses them from start to finish.<br/><br/><br/>",

In Chief Inspector, each player takes on the role of a junior inspector walking the streets of 1800's London, hot on the trail of a Master Criminal. The King wants results, and the player to make the biggest arrest will become the new Chief Inspector.<br/><br/>To set up the game 5 suspects are placed in a line up and beneath each of them face down clue cards of four types: Intelligence, Reputation, Status and Prior Arrests. Hidden on the other side of these clues are truths about the suspects and related numbers.<br/><br/>Players must use their hand of three Inspector cards to uncover clues about the five key suspects, procure the necessary evidence, and arrest the suspect with the highest total value (the most notorious criminal).

        "description": "This two-player game says on the board that it was &quot;approved by United Airlines&quot; and appears to have been developed as marketing tool. The back of the board features a large picture of a United Airlines two-engine &quot;Mainliner&quot;. The front of the board features a UAL logo. And the playing surface - a map of the United States overlaid with a grid of squares 13 wide and 9 deep, seems to include UAL's entire route map in red lines - even though these lines have nothing to do with the game.<br/><br/>Each player has five planes and starts from either New York or San Francisco. Each player must also pick up 10 pieces of baggage en route to the opposite base city. At the start of the game, each player puts the other player's baggage in the most inconvenient pattern possible, since the goal is to be the first player to reach the destination city with all five planes having picked up all 10 bags.<br/><br/>A player may move each plane only one square, either directly or diagonally ahead. Moves North and South are only allowed in the home airport bands on either coast, and planes may never move backward toward their starting airport. If a plane of either player is adjacent in a legal direction, the moving player may jump over the other plane as in checkers but without removing it. Jumps are free moves, and multiple jumps are allowed, followed by a final square forward as usual.<br/><br/>Success depends on artful placing of the opponent's bags, careful planning of a five-plane route that will both reach all bags and enable as many jumps as possible.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "According to the rules, Hurry Home was designed by J. W. Patterson, whose most famous game was the 1939 hit Contack. Described as &quot;72 miles of hilarious enjoyment&quot;, this race game has three twists.<br/><br/>First, the circular course from Home to Town and back again is laid out in three lanes: Red (inner), Yellow (middle) and Green (outer). Second, the game uses a very large 12-sided die with color-coded numbers: 1-4 are red; 5-8 are yellow; and 9-12 are green. Finally, players may only move counter-clockwise on the yellow and red tracks, and must move the opposite direction on green.<br/><br/>Players choose one of seven vehicles: train, plane, bus, car, scooter, bicycle and horse-drawn buggy, but their mode has no bearing on their speed. Each player roles the die and must move on that color track in the direction indicated. If this requires moving sideways to get to the right track, each such move counts against the total: so a player on the red track who rolls green 9 must first spend two points to go sideways to green and then 7 points clockwise.<br/><br/>Player counters block movement by other players, whether sideways or around the track. First player to pass town and then home wins. A variant allows each player three rolls per turn, with the first two being optional and the final one compulsory (even if one or two previous were accepted and moved).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This U.S. election game is played with two decks of cards. The Rollcall deck, backed with stars on blue, contains a card for each state, showing an outline of the state, the cost of campaigning for the state, the number of electoral votes it provides, and one of eight symbols representing different power blocs. The Campaign Deck, with red and white striped backs, consists of five types of cards used to capture states: Campaign contributions (money), Splinter Party, Favorite Sun, Endorsement and Party in Power.<br/><br/>The state card deck is shuffled, and the first six states are laid on the table. Each player receives a hand of seven Campaign cards. On each turn, he uses his hand to take states either from the table or from other players. Once he has made as many moves as he desires and can afford, he ends his turn by drawing two more Campaign cards from the deck.<br/><br/>States on the table can be obtained by discarding campaign contributions greater than or equal to the campaign cost of the state. No change is provided. States can be taken from other players by using the other cards. Using Endorsement, a player must pay 1.5 times the normal cost to take a state from another player; using Favorite Son, he pays only the normal cost; and using Splinter Party, he pays only half the normal cost. The most powerful card is the Party in Power, which allows the taking of one state from each opponent for half their normal costs - but the player must take and pay for a state from each player.<br/><br/>The final element to strategy is the assembly of power blocs. When a player manages to assemble three or more states with the same symbol, he pays $1M per state and places them in front of him as a group. After that, only the top card is vulnerable to attack, and the attacker must pay double the normal cost.<br/><br/>Once the last state has been taken, electoral college votes are tallied and the player with the most votes wins.<br/><br/>",

On this smaller board Fanorona Dimy is played with 12 black pieces and 12 white pieces.<br/><br/>Capturing is compulsory and a series of captures may be made by the same piece on a turn. Unique aspects of the game include its method of capture (either approaching or withdrawing your piece from a line of enemy pieces), and the &quot;vela partie&quot; (debt game) after winning a decisive game (the winner must let the loser &quot;eat&quot; one man each turn for 9 consecutive moves). Because of the density of the board (only one open spot at the games beginning) and the unique method of capture, strategy is complex and enigmatic, with fewer pieces often beating more pieces.<br/><br/>",

When friends come by for a picnic, movie night, party, game night, or just general hanging out, they each pick a card and keep it secret. Each card has an action detailed on it that is out of the ordinary. The players&rsquo; goal is to perform that action without anyone catching on that it is being done for the game. People must notice you are doing the action (unless the card says otherwise). The trick is to try to incorporate it into the context of whatever it is you happen to be doing at the time. If, at the end of the night, you&rsquo;ve pulled it off, you get points based on how tricky the action is to get away with. If you get caught (if someone guesses that you did something weird for the game), you lose any points that you have acquired from that card. You cannot take another card until (1) you are successful with the first one or (2) you get caught doing the first one. If there is debate over whether or not you accomplished something, the group as a whole decides at the end of the night if you pulled it off; partial credit is permitted at the group&rsquo;s discretion. If the action is something that you would do anyways; congratulations, you are a natural at this game and you are weird.<br/><br/>",

You'll need the Silver Key to get through them as well; it must be here somewhere, waiting to be found.<br/><br/>Suddenly there is an inhuman screech, a yowling, ululating expectation of madness that paralyses your body and frays your psyche... from somewhere, out there in the dark.  You pant as your breath returns and you stagger to your feet; you must escape before they can find you!<br/><br/>Game Pieces:<br/><br/>23 Hex Tiles<br/>1 Hex Rift Tile<br/>12 Horror Cards<br/>12 Lost Cards<br/>24 Item Cards<br/>4 Player Tokens<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>The game is played between 2-4 players, the ultimate goal being to escape.  This is done by finding two things; the tile of the gates, and the card of the silver key which opens them.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a random character card and three item cards - maybe even the silver key, which makes the game much more cut-throat, much more quickly.<br/><br/>The players explore, revealing new hexes as they do so, expanding the board out, revealing the unknown.  Sooner or later a player will succumb to a trap, or an attack from another player, or just the bad luck of finding the brain parasite item card.<br/><br/>When this happens, that player is removed from play.  They will come back on their next turn with a Horror card.  They are now an eldritch beast from another dimension, and the only way to recover their humanity is to devour one of the human players - reversing their fates.<br/><br/>The game is heavy on strategy; all the cards affect each other in one way or another,depending on the situation and positioning of the tiles themselves.  Despite this, the rules are simple enough to pick up and play in five minutes.  Games can be over quickly, but the more experienced the players, the more devious and complex their strategies become.<br/><br/>",

Then, he drinks a sample of wine (as indicated on the square) or eats a sample of food (as indicated on the square). Each player starts by placing a marker on a white wine space, and from then on, he has to alternate wine and food space. You can either stay with white wine or change to blush/rose and after that to red. At a minimum, it is recommended to bring at least 3 kinds of wine, with at least one white, one blush/rose, and one red. Think of this as similar to a Pente' wine party.<br/><br/>There are several different wines listed on the game board:<br/><br/>     White, Blush, and Red Wine<br/>     Riesling, Pinot Noir, Chardonnay, White Zinfandel, Merlot, and <br/><br/><br/>Port<br/><br/>     Sweet, Dry, Fruit, and Dessert Wine<br/><br/><br/>Take as little or as much wine as you want to drink on each turn.<br/>Drink responsibly.<br/><br/>",

Players then make deals, conspire and back-stab to either support or oppose these schemes.

The first delivery person to the house gets the tip, but did you remember the order correctly? Which pizza did the zoo order? Mushrooms? Pepperoni?!? You have to race your opponents to get customer&rsquo;s tips first, but make sure you complete the order accurately or you get nothing!<br/><br/>In Pizza Pronto, 3-5 players compete to deliver pizzas to locations around the table by flicking discs and tossing tokens. Each round, an order is read aloud. &ldquo;Hello! I need a pineapple and pepperoni pizza at the zoo and a mushroom and pineapple pizza to the firehouse, please.&rdquo; Players flick their delivery disc in real time, racing to each location. Once there, you can pick up a pizza and try to toss it into the fenced area. When a player has delivered both pizzas, they place their disc in the highest spot on the garage board. Players score points for delivering the correct pizzas to the correct locations, with bonus points awarded for speed and throwing accuracy. Once the deck of cards runs out, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

This game published as a promotion for Dutch biscuit company Verkade, is based on the heroic efforts of the Dutch team, flying a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines DC-2, who came second in the race overall but won the handicap prize.<br/>The board is a map of the eastern hemisphere from England to Australia, with 63 numbered circles (unusually, they are not contiguous nor connected by lines) marking cities both on and off (Peking, Algiers) the official race route. 12 of the circles are blue, and have penalties or bonuses described in the lower left of the board. <br/>The game is described as for &quot;een onbeperkt aantal personnen worden deelgenomen&quot; (an unlimited number of participants), and players much pay an ante of five collector cards from packets of Verkade biscuits. Some of the penalty spaces require payment of more cards into the pool. Although not specified, presumably the winner takes the pool of cards.<br/><br/>",

If 6 play, the 6th is a second Bunyip. The Bunyip(s) starts in the Billabong in the centre of the board, the catchers in the corners of the board. Each player spins a spinner (mounted in the box) and moves that many spaces (1-2-2-3-3-4-5-6). <br/>The Bunyip(s) must pass over (they don't have to stop on) each of the 4 shops in the centre edges of the board. The shops and the pink spaces either side of the shops are prohibited to the catchers. The catchers attempt to land on the Bunyip when he is not in a safe area. If they do so, they spin the Bunyip Escape spinner (a second spinner mounted inside the box): either the Bunyip is moved automatically to another named space, or he is caught (and the catcher wins). If the Bunyip visits all 4 shops and returns to his starting space (the Billabong) he wins.

Set in Queensland, the book details the adventures of Digit Dick , a &quot;little boy only as big as his mother's big toe&quot;, who smuggles himself on holiday with his parents in his father's coat pocket.<br/><br/>The game is a simple roll-and-move race game using marbles as pawns on a board mounted in the game box. The track is a connected sequence of 45 holes. Most holes are small enough to hold the marble in place, but 9 of the holes are large enough to swallow the marble (and represent the adventures Dick has in the book).<br/><br/>Players must throw 1 or 6 on a six-sided die to being, then get to roll again for a proper move. If the player's marble lands on a big hole, it rolls down the box and he must start again. If he lands on an already-occupied small hole, he places hi own marble one space behind (which might be a big hole). He must throw an exact number to finish, otherwise he moves backwards the excess amount.<br/><br/>A second version &quot;for older children and grown-ups&quot;. In this version, a big hole causes you marble to move backwards 5 spaces (instead of starting again). If the countback takes you past the start space, you must start again.<br/><br/>The rules sheet summarizes the story of Digit Dick on the back, and advertises two other Digit Dick book titles; Digit Dick and the Tasmanian Devil (set in Tasmania), and Digit Dick in Black Swanland (set in Western Australia).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1897 educational card game consists of a deck of 48 plain undersized cards, each printed with either a question or an answer in French. The 24 questions and 24 answers are divided equally among the players.<br/><br/>The first player calls out a question, and the player to his left must offer a suitable reply. If he cannot, the next player has an opportunity and so on round the table. When a question is answered, both the questioner and the answerer get to discard those cards, and the player providing a correct answer gets to ask the next question.<br/><br/>The winner is the first to empty his hand unless a question is called out that no one can answer, in which case the game ends immediately and the player with the fewest cards in hand wins.<br/><br/>The rule card says the cards include a vocabulary of more than 200 words and introduce &quot;the various changes of the Articles, Adverbs, Pronouns and Verbs. It can be used with success as a novel and pleasing way of studying the French language.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Grim Reaper is calling it quits! Humans are dying at alarming rates, and he just can't keep up. He's challenged a few individuals to take the burden from his bony shoulders, promising that the most efficient reaper will take a place beside him to become the next big boss. To test themselves, the reapers &mdash; each with their own powers and secret missions &mdash; embark on six different locations and times to capture dying victims, but these potential victims will put up a fight, then bargain for their life, offering valuable help in exchange for mercy. The reapers must decide which victims deserve to die and which are indispensable sidekicks &mdash; well, indispensable until plans change since in the end the Grim Reaper will accept only corpses as proof of your work, so the clock, as always, is ticking.<br/><br/>The Reaper Game is a dice-rolling game with strong set collection and press-your-luck elements. During the game, players roll their dice, then try to fulfill the requirements of the available victims to capture them. In turn, those victims will grant the players unique abilities, such as extra dice or dice manipulation, to help them capture even better victims.<br/><br/>Each victim belongs to a specific location, and at the start of the game players receive three secret objectives that require specific victims in order to grant extra victory points. During the game, the Grim Reaper itself tries to sabotage the tasks of these chosen souls by taking one location out of play, and once a location has been visited three times, it's removed from play completely. After the second location has been removed, the game ends. The Grim Reaper also has special powers, one of each triggers at the start of each round, causing chaos and heartache to the players.<br/><br/>The Reaper Game features an introductory mode suited for new players and for those looking for an easier and even faster experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lost Star is a cooperative/competitive hybrid card game about the internal power struggle of a star ship crew adrift in the galaxy.<br/><br/>The Lost Star's captain is dead, and her crew is lightyears from home. One player in command and up to four other players acting as the crew must cooperate to return home safely. However, the Commander is untrustworthy as he will take credit for the success of the mission.<br/><br/>Play proceeds with drawn encounters of various difficulty. Four decks of cards feed the players' hands based on the their role. The commander takes cards from each of these decks, and plays orders based on his exclusive knowledge of the encounter's potential effects.<br/><br/>In the following phase players are encouraged to dissent and replace their given orders for ones they prefer. Orders affect how the encounter resolves, and successful orders increase the players trust. With which they can use on challenging encounters, boost their fellow crewmembers, or mutiny and take command.<br/><br/>If the crew makes it through all of the encounters the Commander takes credit for the success of the mission and is declared the winner. There is only one winner, but no one wins unless the Lost Star makes it home.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Regions is a game about territory fight, using the same board game set as Go. It has one basic concept: region. The players increase their territory by making regions:<br/><br/>The rule of the Regions is very simple: If the player's current stone and the other 3 stones on the board form a 4-side region (which is formed by vertical lines, horizontal lines and lines of 45&deg;), and the region contains no enemy stones (including edges), then the whole region belongs to the player and will be filled by the player's stones.<br/><br/>When one player has occupied more than half of the territory, then game ends, i.e., whoever takes 181 points wins.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/>    * If there is no restriction to the 4-side region, the shape can be weird and against the common sense. So the region cannot be concave, and any 2 sides of the region cannot be crossing or overlapping, which means, only regular quadrilateral are valid. Actually the shape can only be rectangle, rhombus, parallelogram, trapezoid, and a kind of right-angled quadrilateral. <br/>    * In some special situations, one played stone can form multiple regions<br/>    * Since black moves first and has advantage, so it is ruled that the first move of black cannot be in the center, because center also has advantage. At the end, maybe black needs to pay back some points to white. Currently we assume handicap of 4.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fictional wargame (WW2 themed) for two players in which quite a few things are foggy at the start of the game. To have a better chance of winning you will try to find out what kind of units the enemy has, how many are fielded and where they are located. And hopefully, you will find out your opponent&rsquo;s objective before it is too late.<br/><br/>The hearth of Mists of War is a true double-blind game system without using an extra player as an umpire. You might call it a block wargame because of the cubes, but it goes much further into hiding information than the standard games in this genre. The cubes in Mists of war are not just hidden units, but are used as a system of fog of war which comes and goes according to what your units can actually see. Besides the cubes, Mists of War also gives the players a secret objective to win the game. Furthermore, a player receives a number of force points unknown to the other player which he can spend on buying troops. The more force points you get, the harder your objective will be.<br/>Activation of units is done by selecting zones. Selecting more zones gives your opponent more benefits.<br/>It uses a randomless (no dice) combat outcome in which all the units in the selected zone can act together and add their strength.<br/><br/>",

In Rocca Match, each player can only claim pairs that match and match her player color (a starting card). When you claim a pair of cards, &quot;stack&quot; them like blocks.

        "description": "This game is subtitled The Great Game of Politics ... For the People. There is an octagonal game board with five concentric tracks (each moving closer to the center of power), along with money, Vote cards, Political Backing cards and Media cards.<br/><br/>Players choose one of eight factions (Military, Wealth, Education, Ecology, Women, Labor, Industry, Farm) and take the corresponding Information Card (cheat sheet) and colored plastic token. They also start with $7,800, two Vote cards and four Political Backing cards. They put their tokens on the corresponding spaces in the outer (dark blue) Local Level ring.<br/><br/>Players roll dice and move, winning and losing Political Backing, Money and Votes along the way. They may spend Political Backing cards to change their own die roll by one space, or to change another player's roll, by one if in the same ring or more if in a higher (closer to the center) ring. Media cards provide random rewards and penalties.<br/><br/>Players need to accumulate both money and Vote cards to move up the rings to State, Federal, Convention and finally Campaign Trail. The winner is the first to land by exact roll on the Bigwig space in the innermost ring.<br/><br/>",

The fourth side bore the punchable teetotum spinner, along with 4 counters (yellow one side, white the other).<br/>It is very similar to Snakes &amp; Ladders [US: Chutes &amp; Ladders], but with only 50 squares, and with a &quot;Miss a go&quot; square.  <br/>No rules are included - they are not necessary as it is self-explanatory.  A game of pure luck, although I added a sticker with an additional rule to my copy, allowing a little skill to creep in to a two-player game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Classic Coins of the 20th Century is a card game for two or four players.  Four players may play as individuals or in teams of two.  The deck consists of 36 cards; there are four suits, or coin denominations.  Each suit consists of ranks one through nine, representing the years the coins were minted: 1911 through 1919.   During this period the designs of US coins changed.  The nickel was redesigned in 1913.  The dime, quarter and half dollars were all redesigned in 1916.  These coins are considered great examples of the coining art. On a turn, a player must play one card to the table to try to capture one or more cards that sum to that card's value; if a player can't or doesn't want to do this, he or she must lay one card on the table.  Your goal is to capture as many cards, especially those valuable first year designs, as you can.<br/><br/>Similar game play as seen in Casino and Scopa<br/><br/>",

Each turn, a player (or team) rolls the dice, and moves their pawn the indicated number of spaces. After moving, they will usually have to answer a question, which depends on the space they have landed on. If answered correctly, they score points.<br/><br/>Each time they pass go, the player collects an animal card. These cards are also worth points. However, when a player lands on an Animal Spot, (StrangerBear, BobCat, BuzzFly, AllieGator) they are stuck on that spot until they can discard a matching card. In the meantime, they may draw one new card or trade with another player for a matching card.<br/><br/>The game ends after all players have answered ten questions correctly. This is tracked by coloring in a drawing. Now, the points from the questions and held animal cards are added up. The player with the most points wins the game!<br/><br/>",

He wishes to not only control the city, but the city today, tomorrow, and yesterday. That&rsquo;s where you come in; an indentured servant, forced into a life of non-linear crime. You can&rsquo;t claim to dislike the rewards of your efforts, but the risks involved have you looking for an exit strategy - a normal life.

There are two types of Contracts: standard and release. Standard Contracts are general smuggling jobs and are worth one Contract Point. Release Contracts are tailored to each Shifter&rsquo;s unique skills, but as such, are more challenging. The reward for completion of a Release Contract is that the Shifter named on the Contract receives 5 Contract Points required to win Gary&rsquo;s competition.

        "description": "This 1946 game appears to have been privately developed and produced and predates the somewhat similar games published by 3M, Avalon Hill and Klee by more than two decades. There is a yacht club in one corner of the 24.5 x 19 inch map, and the courses are complicated by three islands and four banks of shoals.<br/><br/>While the basic mechanic is simple (roll two dice), the rules and subtleties do a good job of recreating the tensions of a sailboat race. A red die determines the basic movement amount, but this is modified by matching the red-white combination against a Help and Hindrance card that evens out the results. Net moves range from 0 (6-6=blown out a sail) to 5. Lower red rolls get help and higher ones get penalized.<br/><br/>Unlike later games, the wind is assumed to blow constantly from the top of the board, and courses are laid out accordingly. The rules and realities of sailing apply: a boat on starboard tack has right of way over port; close-hauled over reaching or running; getting to windward of another boat hurts its movement, and so on.<br/><br/>There are rules for tacking, luffing and setting spinnakers. There are shoals that players can try to get over but if their turn ends on a shoal they ground. There is an advanced start process too: instead of rolling for position with highest first, players can spend three turns manoeuvering for position as in a real race.<br/><br/>The rulebook has extensive diagrams of various potential situations, and is designed to make the game instructive as well as fun for players who are not sailors.<br/><br/>",

Shark! game, a mix of 20 fish and two sharks go in a bowl, and everyone tries to use the straws to suck fish out of the bowl and into one in front of them. Anyone caught with a shark on their straw is penalized three fish, and the accuser gets three extra in his bowl. If falsely accused, the penalty and bonus goes the other way. The player with the most fish wins.<br/><br/>In the Relay Race, teams of two run a course across a room or porch, and the first player has to hand off the fish to the second player straw-to-straw. In Rainbow Sippa, players compete for the most points from a mixed bowl with each color counting a different number of points from 1-6.<br/><br/>While the game included only four straws, there is a health note at the bottom of the rules: &quot;For sanitary reasons, see that each Sippa is used by only one person and then destroyed.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Survive for one week and everyone escapes via a raft.  If any of the young ladies become too upset before then, they'll violently lash out at others or even themselves.<br/><br/>The game consists of three phases that repeated over the course of (at most) 7 rounds.<br/><br/>Event Phase - Shuffle the eight tiles and place them in a 3x3 grid.  The last space in the bottom right is left open.  Tiles are then moved around like a slide puzzle and activate various effects.  Some provide food, but most only lead to members of the group becoming upset.  Get the three components of the raft in either one row or column and the phase ends.<br/><br/>Dinner Phase - Three food are consumed by the entire group.  If you come up short, all of the available food is still consumed and every young lady becomes dissatisfied.<br/><br/>Date &amp; Kill Phase - Players may choose to go on a date with one of the young ladies.  Her dissatisfaction is then spread to the other members of the group.  Finally, a check is made to see if any one in the group has become emotionally overwhelmed.  If so, they kill another member of the group or take their own life.<br/><br/>",

Johnson, also president of The Regents Institute, a school for boys and girls in Brooklyn, NYC.<br/><br/>The square paper game board features five maps, one in the middle showing Europe as a whole, and the rest showing parts of the continent. It has a perimeter track of 13 squares per side, and six square tracks leading to the middle map from the center of each side.<br/><br/>The corners and middle squares are blank red. The rest bear the name of a European city with a number suggesting where it may be found on the board. Each player has four tokens and a &quot;clock&quot; spinner that enables moves of 1-12 spaces. When moving, the player must announce the name of the city to which he is moving and the country in which that city is located. He may look at the maps for help, but if he can immediately name the city and country without looking, he gets another turn to a maximum of three.<br/><br/>Landing on another token sends it back to the nearest red square, and first player to complete a full circuit and then move to the centre with all four tokens wins.<br/><br/>",

He calls out the letter and number of his card(s), reads the line(s) on them, and the player with the C card must respond. The first player then hands his card(s) to the C player. To obtain a card, a player with a C card asks a particular player for the name and number of another card in that book. If successful, he receives it and gets another turn; if not his turn ends.<br/><br/>Complete books are set aside as they are formed, and the first player to get rid of all his cards wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>SWAT Command is a cooperative board game for 1 - 5 players set in modern time. The players are controlling a SWAT team attempting to bring a hostage situation to a successful resolution. The game uses resource management, press-your-luck, and grid-based combat mechanics. Six situation variables allow for the game to have a high replay value. Players must work together to use the time that is given to them by the Hostage Negotiator to purchase Team members and equipment, gather intelligence on the situation, and prepare a rescue plan. The longer players wait, the better equipment and personnel they will have, but the more chances that negotiations will go south. Once players choose to rescue the hostages, grid-based combat begins that resolves in about 15 minutes.<br/><br/>The game is based on a hostage situation inside a bank. The situation cards are unknown at the beginning of the game (Hostage and Suspect #, Hostage and Suspect Positions, Equipment and, Motivation) Each game begins with an Arrival Situation that determines how much Time the players begin the game, and whether or not someone is injured and needs immediate rescue. In a multi-player game, one player is the Incident Commander and the other players control dedicated sides of the building.<br/><br/>The first phase of the game is the Containment Phase. A round begins with the Incident Commander rolling a die to simulate negotiations. The result of the roll is how much Time the negotiator has &quot;bought&quot; for the other players. Each player then begins their turn buy using their Time to buy SWAT personnel from the stack to their staging area, moving SWAT from their staging area to the board, purchasing equipment, using SWAT personnel skills, moving, or gathering intelligence. Players can buy everything from a Medic to the Bomb Squad (once revealed) and Flash Bangs to Plastic Explosives. If players begin their turn with no Time, A card is drawn that has a negative effect for that player or the entire team to simulate the suspects doing something. Certain actions require the player to draw a reaction from the suspects that range from a gunshot heard inside with an unknown result to a hostage crawling out the window.<br/><br/>At any time, or when the team is ready, the Incident Commander may initiate the Rescue Phase. All players move their squads to their breach points (windows/doors), breach doors and determine amount of surprise, reveal any unknown information, Snipers then shoot, Squads begin movement, squads then mark their shots simultaneously, once all shots are marked the shots are taken. Repeat the Snipers to shooting steps until surprise is over and then the suspects react by moving, shooting or surrendering until all the suspects have been neutralized or arrested.<br/><br/>A quick-play version is comprised of scenarios that tell the players how to set up SWAT team members, equipment, and scenario cards. The players then skip the first phase of the game and go straight to the second phase, the Rescue Phase, to attempt to rescue the hostages. All scenarios can be played at various levels of difficulty by adding or subtracting equipment items that give the players bonuses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This early-1930s game from Wilder Manufacturing Co. of St. Louis hearkens back to the Victorian era with its focus on moral rectitude. The game consists of a deck of 48 cars, 24 of which illustrate Faults and 24 illustrate matching Virtues. There also are four cards with a list of all the Faults and the Virtues that cancel their effects, and a set of four wooden racks.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt six blue-backed Faults and six red-backed Virtues. He puts his Faults upright in the racks facing away from him, so that others can see his Faults but he cannot. By looking at his opponents' Faults, a player must work out which Faults he has, and on his turn puts a Virtue from his hand on the table that will match one of his Faults.  If this Fault is in his rack, it is removed and discarded along with the Virtue from his hand.<br/><br/>If a player feels that he does not have a needed Virtue in his hand, he may draw a card from the player on his right. If it matches one of his Faults, he discards both cards. If not, he must take one of the Faults from that player as a penalty. The first player to dispose of all his Faults wins the game.<br/><br/>",

There also are six green spaces for individual cards. Each of the cards has a number and either a piece of clown face or an animal.<br/><br/>Players are dealt eight cards each, with the remainder forming a draw pile. In turn each must try to play a card on one of the spaces. The first player must play either a 1 card on one of the clown noses or an animal card on a green space. If he can do neither, he draws a card.<br/><br/>Each clown face must be built up in number order, from 1 (nose) to 2 (eyes), 3 (mouth) 4 (eyebrows), 5-6 (ears) and finally 7 (hair). There are two spaces for eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and upper and lower ears, and the right and left numbered spaces must have precisely matching parts on each face.<br/><br/>Each player either plays a card or draws until one player managers to win by being the first to empty his hand. The rules recommend continuing the game until all the clown faces are filled out.<br/><br/>",

The player with the most treasures wins the game.<br/><br/>Each round, a treasure is unearthed from each of four sites. Treasure value ranges from 1 to 10. Then each player plays a thief and reveals them simultaneously.<br/><br/>A thief card has a specific color that indicates which site to go to. If you go into a site alone, you steal all the treasures there.<br/><br/>If two or more players chose the same site, they can negotiate to split the treasures there, or fight to grab all the treasures. Treasures not taken are held over to next round, heating up the game. Players hire thieves using treasures they have stolen.<br/><br/>The base set has special cards: Knights and Golems.

All other players win because the department gets investigated and all survivors are liberated from overworking.<br/><br/>If all players survive four weeks without exceeding 300 hours, all players win the game.<br/><br/>There are four types of cards in the game.<br/>(1) paperwork: Playable while you have control of Miya-chan to finish a job<br/>(2) snack: Playable in response to paperwork to gain control of Miya-chan<br/>(3) toy: Playable while you have control of Miya-chan to make others discard snacks<br/>(4) paperwork with candy: Playable while a toy is active to gain control of Miya-chan<br/><br/>Use them wisely and finish all jobs with Miya-chan.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>100ä¸äººæ­»ãã é¨ç½²ã¸ããããï¼<br/>ããªããã¡ç¤¾å¡ï¼ãã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼ï¼ã¯ã100ä¸äººæ­»ãã é¨ç½²ãã¨å¼ã°ããé¨ç½²ã«éå±ãããä»äºï¼4æã®ææ­ï¼ãæ¸¡ããããã¨ã«ãªãã¾ãã<br/>ææ­ã¯ãã¢ã«ãã¤ãã®ããã¤ã¡ãããã«æä¼ã£ã¦ããããã¨ã§æ¸ãããã¨ãã§ãã¾ãã<br/>ç¤¾å¡åå£«ã§ããã¤ã¡ããã«æä¼ã£ã¦ãããæ¨©å©ããå¥ªãåããèª°ãããæ©ãèªåã®ä»äºï¼ææ­ï¼ãã¼ã­ã«ãã¾ãããï¼<br/>ææ­ãæ®ã£ã¦ãã¾ã£ãäººã¯ãã«ã¼ãã®æ°å­ãåè¨ãã¦ãæ®æ¥­æéãã¨ãã¦è¨é²ãã¦ããã¾ãã<br/>åå©æ¡ä»¶ã¯2ã¤ãããâ èª°ãã®æ®æ¥­æéãç´¯è¨300æéãè¶ãã¦ãéå´æ­»ï¼è² ãï¼ãããéã«çãã¦ãããã¨ããã¾ãã¯ãâ¡å¨å¡ã§4é±éçãæ®ããã¨ãã§ãã<br/>ã²ã¼ã ã®ãã§ã¤ãºã¯4æ®µéããããããããæºåããã¹ã¿ã¼ããã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼ã®æ±ºå®ããæ¨©å©ãå¥ªãåãã¡ã¤ã³ã®ã²ã¼ã ããæ®æ¥­æéã®è¨ç®ã¨åå©å¤å®ãã«ãªãã¾ãã<br/>ãã®æºåï½åå©å¤å®ã¾ã§ã®æµãã1é±éã¨å¼ã³ãèª°ãæ­»ãã§ããªããã°ææ­ãéããªããã¦åéãã¾ãï¼1é±éãçµããã®ã«ã¯3åããããã¾ããï¼ï¼ã<br/>ã¡ã¤ã³ã®ã²ã¼ã ã§ã¯ãæ¨©å©ãæã£ã¦ãããã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼ãææ­ããå ´ã«ã«ã¼ãããã¬ã¤ãã¦ããã¾ããã«ã¼ãã«æããã4ç¨®é¡ã®çµµæã§æ¨©å©ãå¥ªãåãã¾ãã<br/>æ¨©å©ãæã£ã¦ããã¨ãã«ãã¬ã¤ã§ããæ¸é¡ãæ¸é¡ãåºãæã«åºãã¦æ¨©å©ãå¥ªãããããã¤ããæ¨©å©ãæã¤ã¨ãã«ä»å¨ãã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼ã®ããã¤ãæ¨ã¦ããããããã¡ãããããã¡ããåºãæã«ããã¤ã®ä»£ããã«åºãã¦æ¨©å©ããã°ããããã¾ãã¤ãæ¸é¡ãã®4ç¨®é¡ãããã¾ãã<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Depression-era party game is really a gambling game, but green wooden disks are provided as a game currency. The board has a central pot with a buff corridor from each of the four sides. In between are three concentric octagonal rings (Green outer, Grey middle, Orange inner). On these rings are spaces with 8 Up elevators, 8 Down elevators and 16 black circles.<br/><br/>There are 16 numbered wooden tokens and matching cardboard disks. Each player takes one of the tokens randomly from the cup and keeps it secret. The cardboard disks are distributed randomly onto the black circles on the board. The goal of the game is to land on and &quot;collect&quot; one's own disk number.<br/><br/>Each player antes one chip and moves onto the board via one of four Entrance Elevators. Players roll a red and a white die and may choose which to use (red goes left, white goes right). Elevators, dots and the buff corridors must be reached by exact throw. In a buff corridor, a player immediately tries to reach the pot by exact count (1,2 or 3 depending on ring); if successful, he collects the pot, and everyone antes again. In either case goes back outside the building.<br/><br/>When a player lands on and captures a numbered disk other than his own, the owner (if in play)must say &quot;That's Me&quot; and pay his captor five chips. Landing on another player &quot;bumps&quot; them and requires a fine of one chip to the pot and another to the bumper. The winner is the first to land on and collect his own numbered disk. The winner collects the pot plus 10 chips from each player.<br/><br/>",

The board is a linear track of 38 destinations starting from a Port of Departure and ending in a Port of Arrival. There is no rhyme or reason to the order of the destinations, which are literally all over the map.<br/><br/>One player or non-player acts as the Tour Director, and holds the pack of Destination Cards (which list a variety of information about each destination. There are three piles of Itinerary Cards labelled Day 1, Day 3, and Day 6. Each player starts with $3,430. Each destination has a landing fee, starting at $300 for the first destination, Antigua, and rising to $1,000 by the final one, Tokyo.<br/><br/>Each player rolls two dice and advances that many destinations. First he pays the landing fee to the bank. Second, the Tour Director asks him what he knows about that destination. If the player supplies any of the information on the destination cards, he gets rewards. Third, he may buy the destinations Investment Certificate, which pays dividends each time a player lands there. Finally, he then takes an Itinerary Card, from the Day 1 pile on turn 1, Day 3 on turn 2, Day 6 on turn 3 and rotating from there.<br/><br/>When they reach the Port of Arrival, players must pay $500 and start over. The game ends as soon as one player runs out of money, and the winner is the one with the most money left.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The brightly colored board makes this game look simple, but it is not. There are one red and one white dice, and a single 47-space track spiralling counter-clockwise and inward from the Start. The track includes 10 spaces where players draw Situation Cards that provide benefits or penalties. But the key to the game are the 21 spaces labelled Log Book and numbered 1, 2 or 3.<br/><br/>When landing on a Log Book space, the player rolls the dice twice more. The first red-white combination determines the section of the Log Book to consult (e.g. a 5 red, 2 white = section 52). A second roll, adding the two dice, gives the question number to be asked (e.g. a red 4 and white 3 = question # 7)<br/><br/>These are not simple questions. The easier ones are True/False or multiple choice, but some ask for detailed knowledge of flying rules (e.g. &quot;What is wrong with a pilot flying a heading of 200 degrees at an altitude of 3,500 feet?&quot;, aeronautics (&quot;Vfc/Mfc means ?&quot;) and even history (&quot;What date did the airforce take delivery of the first P47D?&quot;).<br/><br/>To win, the player must make it to the second-last square and answer two questions correctly, then roll doubles and answer two final questions. The rules say that Fly-In &quot;can be a learning tool to help the aspiring pilot be more aware of the world of flying&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>",

It consists of an 8-page rule booklet and 72 small (3.25&quot; x 1&quot;) yellow cards, each of which has a number, a phrase &quot;Plant .....&quot; and the question: &quot;What will come up?&quot;<br/><br/>The rules say it is best played by &quot;a large and mixed company&quot;, with one person chosen as Keeper of the Pool, or more precisely holder of the answer book. The cards are distributed equally among the players along with an equal number of tokens. Players take turns asking the player to their left the question on one of their cards, the answer to which is always some kind of plant or flower. The Keeper of the Pool judges the answer against the book and if the answer is wrong, the responder pays the asker one of his tokens.<br/><br/>Some examples from the book: <br/>Plant a shepherd. What will come up? Phlox.<br/>Plant a river. What will come up? A Currant.<br/>Plant a man who won't pay his debts. What will come up? Willow.<br/><br/>There is one exceptional rule. &quot;7. By vote of a majority of the players, rewards shall be paid from the pool for unusual brilliancy, and fines imposed for ludicrously erroneous answers. For example, when this game was first played, a young lady drawled out, in answer to the question 'Plant a menagerie. What will come up?' the single word 'Grapes'. Upon being made to realize that she intended to suggest the idea of 'Gray apes', the Keeper of the Pool voluntarily paid to her the sum of ten counters.&quot; Yes, that entire passage is in the rule booklet.<br/><br/>",

It combines a snakes-and-ladders type track with a story in the rule book that plays out through the illustrations along the track.<br/><br/>It has its roots in a Russian fairy-tale, and shows strapping young lad starting life placidly farming with his father, seeing his father go off to war on horseback and come back wounded, and then following in his footsteps.<br/><br/>He goes off to war, has his comrades in the lines betrayed to the fascists, survives capture and prison and eventually triumphs over both the fascist trio and the cigar-smoking capitalist giving orders behind the scenes.<br/><br/>",

Players move their units of various strengths to constantly improve their own position, while weakening their opponent.  All units share the strength of adjacent allied units when resolving attacks/defense, and charge movements allow long chains of units to be moved to trap, manipulate, and eliminate their opponent&rsquo;s units.<br/><br/>Each player takes one move per turn, and based on positions of allied and enemy pieces, attack and defense scores may be bolstered by adjacent units. Players may choose to have any number of allied units follow behind the piece moved.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to eliminate each of the opponents 3 most powerful units; when only one of the 3 most powerful units is left, that player must choose one of his remaining pieces to remove from play at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>",

The booklet has rules for 20 different party-style games. These include Mufti-spiel (like Simon Says), Das Klingel-Spiel (Musical Chairs), Das blinde Ruh-spiel (Blind Man&rsquo;s Buff), Die stummen Spieler oder Pantomime (Charades), and a set of terrific Teutonic tongue twisters.<br/><br/>What these games have in common is that at least one player may or must fail, and that&rsquo;s where the cards come in. The company selects one of their number to act as the warden and choose which card to inflict on each loser. Each card includes one to three challenges. Card 39, for instance, orders that the player either &ldquo;have one or two persons of the opposite sex kiss your eyes&rdquo; or &ldquo;confess which Commandment you have sinned against most often&rdquo; or &ldquo;kiss the most beautiful person in the room&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Described on the box as entertaining and funny, the booklet takes pains to assure readers that the games and forfeits include &ldquo;nothing insulting, much less offensive, but only for the humorous maintenance of youth&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The cards and booklet are printed in a pre-umlaut Fraktur script, and the cards appear to have been hand-cut, since they vary in width and length by as much as 1/8 inch, and by as much as 3/32 inch from top to bottom of a given card. The publisher was an art dealer as well as publisher based in Stuttgart in the early to mid-1800s.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This horse racing game by John Jaques of London was a follow-up to its successful 1910 offering Minoru (named after the horse that made King Edward VII the first reigning monarch to win an Epsom Derby in 1909). Manifesto is the name of another famous horse that raced in the Aintree Grand National a record eight times between 1895 and 1904, finishing third three times and winning twice, the second time carrying a record weight of 12 stone 13 pounds. (Wikipedia, Grand National Guide)<br/><br/>While Minoru focused on betting the odds on horses that had different lengths to run and equal chances of advancing, Manifesto says on its box that &quot;players win on their judgement&quot;.<br/><br/>There are eight horses, each running a straight 20-space track. Each turn, players must choose one of three cards for each horse: Careful, Risky, and Reckless. By playing Careful, a horse will move safely between 1 and 3 spaces on 2D6. Playing Risky means moves of 2-4 spaces, but failing to move at all on rolls of 5, 7 and 9. And Reckless offers the chance of moves from 3-5 spaces, but failure to move on 4, 6 and 8, and a fall (elimination from race) on a 10.<br/><br/>The odds are set in a way that the average outcome of each card is identical, so &quot;judgment&quot; really comes down to &quot;How lucky do you feel?&quot;<br/><br/>Described on the cover as being designed by the (unnamed) &quot;inventor of Minoru, the box has cover art by British equestrian painter George Dervill Rowlandson.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts by picking a profession at random, with salaries ranging from 120 pounds a month for a postman to 300 pounds a month for an actor.<br/><br/>Player tokens then proceed around the board with opportunities to make investments in either unit trusts (which pay triple at game end) or a house, to use hire-purchase to buy household appliances, to put money into or take it out of banks and building societies (paying 8%) or Local Council (10%), as well as to encounter Accidents or Unexpected Expenses and to buy a wide variety of Insurance Policies against such ills.<br/><br/>Purchasing a property requires a minimum deposit, surveyors fee and solicitors fee, as well as monthly repayments of about 1% of the mortgage amount. Passing Start provides monthly salary for the occupation less all monthly payments (rent or mortgage, insurance, hire-purchase). The winner is the first to accumulate total assets of 15,000 pounds.<br/><br/>This made-in-England game is undated, but the graphics point to late 1950s or early 1960s (the family father on the box is smoking a cigar and wearing a jacket with cravat). The box claims a copyright, but there is no indication of the copyright owner or publisher, with the possible exception of a small cathedral-like logo on all four sides of the box. The rules and play suggest it might have been produced by a company in the investment or insurance business.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "German cycling game from the late 1920s published by a company from Leipzig.<br/><br/>There are six riders in the game, divided into two teams. Three of the riders (black, red and yellow) have a special lap counter in their back wheel. These riders are moved with the three coloured dice on the outer lane (with roman numerals) and try to win a lap over their competitors. The game rules calls them &quot;Tempofahrer&quot;, which might be translated as &quot;endurance riders&quot;.<br/><br/>The three other riders are sprinters. They race each other on the inner lane at given intervals and compete just for some points which count only in case of a tie in the number of laps won.<br/><br/>There are the three coloured dice.<br/><br/>These three dice are thrown in turns and the riders in the outer lane advance as many fields as dice mark their colour or their teammate's (three-coloured dice would have been enough and probably better). However, if in a turn none of the dice shows your colour(s), you fall back to the red square with no lap won.<br/><br/>So you hope for a long run of throws with at least one of your colours to win a lap. And most often than not you get a bad throw when you have completed more than three quarters of a lap and you are very near your objective. That hurts!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the sprinters wait their turn to play. At intervals (the rules are not particularly precise here) the coloured dice are put aside, the riders on the outer lane stay wherever they are, and a short sprint takes place between the three riders on the inner lane. No complicated rules here either, just throw and move, with a couple of penalty squares (2 -only reachable by a double one on the first throw- and 13). Teams whose sprinters land twice on these squares during the game (in different sprints, most probably) are penalized with one lap.<br/><br/>The rules state that some player or onlooker can call a sprint anytime during the game for a special price he is willing to offer (a present for the winner of that sprint). Just like the &quot;primes&quot; in 6-day races.<br/><br/>The player whose rider(s) perform best during the race by crossing the finish line first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

This trivia style party game is about the Tour de France.<br/><br/>The author is French cycling journalist Jean-Paul Ollivier.<br/><br/>The yellow box contains 160 cards, divided in the five categories. The back of the cards is of a different colour for each category.<br/><br/>To give the game some &quot;strategic&quot; edge, there are 4 types of cards in each category.<br/>22 (out of 32) cards in each category named after the category. Besides, there are 3 &quot;booster&quot; cards, 3 &quot;accident&quot; cards and 4 &quot;contre la montre&quot; (time trial) cards in each category. These cards have a different symbol in the back, making a total of 20 different card backs (5 colours, 4 symbols each).<br/><br/>The 22 &quot;normal&quot; cards give one point for a correct answer.The &quot;booster&quot; cards give three points, while the &quot;accidents&quot; deduct three points from the player in case of a wrong answer. The three categories of questions in the card are given different names for each type of card, which only adds a baroque touch to the game. In all cases the player only has to answer to one question, chosen by the opponent.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the time trial cards have four questions and the player must answer as many as he can in one minute, getting 1, 2, 3 or 5 points.<br/>Winner is the player who scores the most points.<br/><br/>",

This is a betting game in which any number of players can take part. Players do not manage a particular rider but just bet on the outcome of the race. Players must agree upon the numbers of laps, and cyclists move according to the throw of dice.<br/><br/>During their turn every player can move any cyclists since it is unknown who placed bets on which rider.<br/><br/>In a way this has similar mechanics like games as like Heimlich &amp; Co. (hidden identity) and Reiner Knizia's classic horse racing game Winner's Circle (published by Alea) which also featured players making hidden bets during a race. <br/>This is remarkable for an antique game from the early 20th century.<br/><br/>After the race is over and the riders have finished the races the players reveal their bets and he who placed the most accurate bets wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "--Introduction--<br/><br/>The 12 Towers is an RPG board game for 2-6 players. The objective is to take control of all. Active Towers, and/or eliminate the opposing players. <br/>Players take the role of &ldquo;Keepers&rdquo;, powerful rulers that control a Tower, and its surrounding territory. Throughout the course of the game, Towers will be <br/>gained, lost, or even destroyed. Controlling Towers will involve combat, diplomacy, and teamwork. However, it may also involve treachery and deception.<br/>                 <br/>            While the objectives of the game are clear, it is entirely up to the players to decide how they play the game individually. Some may be aggressive <br/>and charge head on, while others might focus on defensive actions. In the end, when players interact, they are in complete control of their own fate. <br/>Not only do you bring a strategy to the game, you bring your personality as well.<br/><br/>--Brief Overview of the game--<br/><br/>Players: 2-6<br/>Game Type: PvP, RPG, Exploration, Board Control<br/>Game Board: 32 x 32 Inch Dodecahedron (13 pieces)<br/>Movement Style: Set space amount (Can be increased or decreased)<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/> - 12 Keeper Figurines<br/> - 12 Tower Figurines<br/> - 12 Colored Die<br/> - 576 Game Cards<br/> - 6 Tracker Sheets<br/> - 12 5x7 Tower Cards<br/><br/>Game Run Time:<br/> Easy/2 Players - 30/60 Minutes<br/> Medium/4 to 6 Players - 45/90 Minutes<br/> Hard/8 to 12 Players - 120/180 Minutes<br/><br/>--Game Board--<br/><br/>The board for The 12 Towers uses a hexagon battle grid. Players can explore, battle, cast spells, set up walls and defensive structures, and even set traps. <br/>There is no limitation to where you can go, or what you can do. It is important to know what the different colored spaces and regions do. <br/>Remember, the rules are for a standard game, and players have the freedom to alter these rules and regulations to better suit their needs.<br/><br/>--Towers--<br/><br/>Each Tower in the game has a unique theme, as well as it&rsquo;s own strengths and weaknesses. Remember, it is important to explore options, and try out other Towers. <br/>You may have a favorite Tower, or discover a useful combination that can turn the tides of battle, and become an intimidating force!<br/><br/>Your Tower is the home of your Keeper, and it&rsquo;s surrounding territories belong to you and your citizens. Whether you&rsquo;re the Brutal Orc King of the Fire Tower, or the <br/>Undead Lord of the Black Tower, your Keeper is the King of it&rsquo;s territory. As you play the game, you&rsquo;ll gain control, or lose Towers. <br/>Be sure to use strategy and planning when you take over the board.<br/><br/>--Power--<br/><br/>Power is the heart of The 12 Towers. Power is a simplified number that represents everything that you are; Health, Mana, Currency, Influence, everything. <br/>Almost everything in the game effects Power. Whether you are taking damage from weapons, or casting spells. All players begin the game with the same amount of Power. <br/>The standard starting amount is 2000. This number is them divided between your Keeper, and your starting Tower. <br/>This number can be adjusted to use needs, or accommodate additional players.<br/><br/>--Cards--<br/>    <br/> The core version of The 12 Towers contains 576 cards. There are 2 types of cards; Items, and Events. Items are cards you can equip, use, cast and break. <br/>Event cards are primarily used to give the players an advantage, as well as set the stage for role playing, and gives life and scenery to the game. <br/>Events are the main source of gaining more item cards.<br/><br/>",

It follows the path of a typical Bushman, proceeding from his enlistment to training, embarkation, arrival in South Africa, and engagements with the enemy.<br/><br/>The game is basically a re-implementation of the traditional Game of goose, with players rolling dice and moving around a 60-space track. Most spaces have a themed text: Riding test, promoted to lieutenant, ordered to the front, taken prisoner, etc. Some of these spaces also incur bonuses or penalties (moving forward or back a number of spaces, to a particular space, or miss a turn).<br/><br/>The board includes coloured illustrations of bushmen rounding up cattle in the Australian outback prior to enlistment, a street parade of a Bushmen's Contingents, transport ship, field hospital, field prison, troop ship S.S. Medic, and battle scenes showing Australian prisoners guarded by Boers, and Australian troops attacking a Boer position.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Simple roll and move race game around a 60-space track, with a yachting theme. 12 of the 60 spaces offer bonuses or penalties. Unusually, each of the 4 players has his own path, parallel to each other, but separate.<br/><br/>The first version of the game Pre dates the National Games trademark. W. Owen of Ballarat manufactured the Yacht Race game under his name prior to continuing production under the National label. This appears to date the first version somewhere between the late 1890's to early 1900's. An advertisement is seen in 1902 for the game.<br/><br/>As with many of the National Games produced, the game over the years appeared in three general forms; <br/>1. A large hardback board with a small separate box containing the playing pieces.<br/>2. A small boxed version containing a thin carded board and pieces. This has the National Games Logo on the box<br/>3. A large boxed version with a thin carded board (but larger in dimensions than the small box), playing pieces but no National Games Logo on the box<br/><br/>Another earlier version titled &quot;National Yacht Race&quot; was also produced by the National Game Company in 1912 but this game has 75 numbered spaces, a different layout and a different Registered number. It is therefore listed elsewhere.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Monopoly-style game is subtitled &quot;Chester Attractions Trading Game&quot;, and features the many tourist draws of Chester, known as the most complete surviving walled city in the UK.<br/><br/>Rather than following the perimeter, the 64-space playing track winds its way around each quarter of the board in turn. There are 31 attractions, in 7 groups of four and one of three. There are two sets of cards, Lord Mayor and Town Crier, that deliver random penalties and benefits.<br/><br/>Landing on an unowned attraction allows its purchase. Landing on an attraction owned by another player requires paying an admission fee. There is no building, but the admission fee rises as more attractions of the same colour are bought. The fee doubles with the second property, octuples with the third and goes to 50 times the base fee for a complete set. Most money wins.<br/><br/>The game bears no publisher identification or copyright, and has a self-published feel, possibly a prototype. The square board comes in two segments with smooth plastic taped edges and a hinge made from two Velcro fasteners. The cards and game pieces come inside a transparent plastic purse, and the game as a whole is in a large ziplock bag.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A unique motor racing board game simulation based on the real life rules for the 2016 motor racing season. The first in a series with a new racing circuit planned for release each season. Up to 6 players race around the track using authentic lines of travel rather than a grid system. The racing line is the quickest route around the circuit if you can get on it and stay there. Choose to play over 3 or more laps.<br/><br/>Use judgement to know when to overtake, slipstream the car in front, or take an alternative line into a corner. Time your pit-stop carefully. Be prepared for random events like a change in the weather, the safety car or engine management issues. If it happens in the real world, it can happen in the game.<br/><br/>Comes with both Basic and Advanced rules for beginners or racing enthusiasts. Advanced rules allow for 5 weather conditions, full tyre selection and choice of driving styles.<br/><br/>New tracks will be based on the 21 international circuits used through the racing season and you will be able to vote on which track you want to see next. They won't be exactly to scale or the game boards will be huge but we will preserve the authentic racing lines.<br/><br/>Each new circuit will be a self-contained game with up-to-date rules that incorporate New Season changes (such as a return to mid-race refuelling). If the rules change mid-season (as they did with qualifying in 2016) there will be a corresponding game rules change available for download from our main website. The new playing pieces will be in new team colours.<br/><br/>For anyone who wants to just keep the same track there will be an update pack available with the new cars, new rules and any additional cards that are necessary.<br/><br/>FWR does not attempt to simulate the cockpit driving experience: we felt that was being done much better with electronic console games. Instead, it gives you the fun of competing against family and friends around a table using tactical judgements about what racing line to take, when to try to overtake, when to come into the pits, what to do when the weather changes, when to take risks and when to play safe. The racing dice that contributes to movement only has the numbers 2,3,3,3,4,4. It adds to the fun and unpredictability but is rarely critical. Luck is a factor, just as in the real world but it doesn't dominate the game.<br/><br/>Far more significant might be a decision about whether to try to overtake the leader on the last lap when you are on dry tyres and it's started raining...<br/><br/>In the advanced rules, such decisions become more important. To simulate conditions across the world's racing circuits, there are 6 different types of weather that include factors like temperature as well as rain. You will have access to the full range of dry weather tyre compounds: ultrasoft, supersoft, soft, medium and hard. Three of these will be available for any particular game. Plus, of course, there will be wet weather tyres.<br/><br/>There will be several ways to determine weather conditions and tyre availability at the start of the game.<br/><br/>In addition, in the advanced rules you can change your driving style to suit the prevailing conditions and circumstances. For example, if you have a good lead or are running low on fuel you might want to reduce risk and drive cautiously. If it's the final lap and you want to go flat out to catch the leader, you might take more risks and push the car to the limit.<br/>All up to you!<br/><br/>We hope you will enjoy Fifth Wing Racing, collect the tracks and download the Championship rules in 2017 so that you can compete with each other through a season of races. Have fun!<br/><br/>",

The catch is that each move, the player must answer a skill-testing question, with the question topic depending on the segment of the race.<br/><br/>There are 10 decks of question cards: General Boating Rules; Nautical Knowledge; Buoys and Markers; Sea Survival; Lights &amp; Flags; Fire Fighting; First Aid; Sound Signals; Engineering; and Knots &amp; Anchors. There also is a Flash Card deck of signs and objects to recognize that comes into play on certain spaces around the board.<br/><br/>There are some interesting accessories: there is a real rope for answering knot questions, and a real triangular bandage that must be put on another player as part of a First Aid test. Players keep score with little black Life Rings, starting with 10, losing some along the way and winning one for each correct answer. The winner is not the first home but the one with the most rings.<br/><br/>",

Now, however, a new threat arises, threatening to drive them all to extinction: Miasma. As Defenders of Shalvion, players will take on a role of one of 6 factions, or the villainous Miasma.<br/><br/>Game play begins with a card drafting phase in which most players will draw 7 cards and choose 1. They will pass the remaining cards to the left. Choose 1. And continue down until there is 1 card left. This card is added to the others to create a Miasma Deck. Then the real game begins.<br/><br/>During the Defender Phase, players will choose 1 card to play, with the option to boost their cards with resources. (If the card represents a player's own faction, the card may be boosted without resources.) After this action has been taken, the players will then gather resources from any planets they control, and send their ships to attack the threat.<br/><br/>During the Miasma Phase, 1 card is flipped. Miasma gains resources and takes an action against the players. (Miasma may also be an active player, in which, the player decides which card to play.) <br/>Players will need to watch that Miasma does not gain too many resources and become too powerful. If Miasma survives 5 rounds, Miasma wins. If Miasma gains too many resources or defeats all factions, Miasma wins. But if the factions are able to defeat Miasma, they will gain points according to their faction's unique victory conditions. And the player with the greatest number of points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1906 trick-taking card game has a deck of 54 cards divided into six suits of nine cards each. The suits are ranked by color: Purple (highest), Red, Yellow, Green, Blue and Brown (lowest). Each suit has the following cards: King (highest), Duke, Marquis, Earl, Viscount, Bishop, Baron, Baronet and Knight (lowest).<br/><br/>The key difference from most trick-taking games is that there is no trump suit, only relative ranks. The Purple King takes anything; the Brown Knight loses to everything; the Brown King takes any card of any suit lower than King, but loses to all the other Kings.<br/><br/>Each trick taken during a hand counts as two points. Each Viscount taken counts an extra two points. A game is normally to 40 points.<br/><br/>After the deal, each player starting to the dealer's left has an opportunity to make a Single Call. He may call a Peerage (five tricks), House of Lords (seven tricks), Royal (all the tricks) or Misere (lose all the tricks). Any player making a call then plays against all the other players. A successful Peerage scores 20 points, Misere or House of Lords 30 points, and Royal 40 points . If unsuccessful, each other player scores 10 points against Peerage, 15 against House of Lords or Misere and 20 points against Royal.<br/><br/>The booklet includes rules for a partnership version, a two-player version and a variant called Game of Viscounts.<br/><br/>",

The name of the game appears on the felt along with an outline of a bug that has a round body, round head, two eyes, two feelers, six legs and one tail.<br/><br/>Each player has a sheet with 12 small boxes, each good for one game. Players take turns shaking the box, and the letter that appears determines what part of the bug they can draw.<br/><br/>They must roll a B in order to begin drawing the bug, and then an H in order to draw the head. After that, they may add whatever piece of the bug corresponds to the letter on the die. First player to complete a bug drawing wins.<br/><br/>",

He's not someone that can last long on his own, and in fact is at his best when he's helping others to be at their best. He allows your Party to reposition itself and to move quickly, while his tough Direwolf Hirelings slow down the enemy. It's all about getting the most out of your Party as a whole, and that often requires a bit of finesse.<br/><br/>The expansion includes three new scenarios, as well as rules to use Borr in all five base game scenarios.<br/><br/>",

Each 0 card taken or held counts 5 points, and whichever player ends up with Mr. Raffles scores 10 points. Game is to 100 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This rare 1978 title is a game of space combat played out on a huge map featuring a stylized solar system and a massive web of connecting stars within a grid of squares. Eight of the nine planets are used as bases for between two and eight players. Each player has five ships, with the objective of either eliminating an opponent's five ships or getting one of his ships onto an opponent's planet.<br/><br/>Ships can either fire or move in a turn but not both. Range is measured not by star links but by number of squares counted orthogonally. Combat results are Hit or Miss, with the chance of a Hit increasing as range decreases. There are nine Firing Cards of 10 cards, with the number of the deck equal to the range and to the number of Miss cards it contains. Some of the result cards also trigger events through Space Conditions cards.<br/><br/>The movement and combat systems interact. When a ship succeeds in hitting and eliminating another ship, it gets promoted, by a degree that varies with the difference in ranks between the two. A ship's level does not affect combat, but does determine how many stars it can move in a turn. Ship rank ranges from 1 to 12.<br/><br/>",

All three games use the open-outcry method of trading cards (shouting a number of cards willing to trade but not their nature), and the goal of collecting all the cards of one kind.<br/><br/>Bourse uses a deck of 80 cards, ten each of eight commodities: Wheat (80 points), Corn (70), Cotton (60), Oil (50), Beef (40), Pork (30), Mutton (20) and Stocks (10). There are no special cards like GSE's Fatal Telegram or Pit's Bull and Bear.<br/><br/>",

Tile locations are marked in a notepad for future reference. Object tiles can be used to to help find treasure. For example, the Map allows a player to look at two face down tiles. Also, traps can be used on opponents. For instance, the Pit causes a player to lose a turn.<br/><br/>When a player has deduced the locations of at least two treasure tiles, the player may then begin placing their dice on the game board. The dice do not tell the exact locations of the Treasure tiles, rather, they tell the distance. The first person to place all three of their dice on the board wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players move along the map and explore new areas by laying down a card that represents a place on the map. Exploration leads to new weapons, outlaws that block the way, gold, shoot outs, saloon brawls, cattle stampedes and more.<br/><br/>Enemies are fought with a simple dice mechanic. Each weapon and enemy rolls a single six sided dice, and their power varies depending on the weapon used vs the difficulty number on the outlaws card. Each victory is rewarded with a number of gold pieces.<br/><br/>When a player lays down the last map card reaching the end of the Dust Trail a random infamous character is drawn and must be defeated.<br/><br/>The game ends when the infamous character is defeated and gold is collected for their defeat. The winner is the player with the most gold. If players are tied, they must shoot it out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rat Rod Race is a unique and fun new board game for all the family. It was designed to provide a more tactile and interactive experience for the players with a retro vintage style to match the theme. The game is a crossover which incorporates elements of traditional board games, card games, racing games and component building.<br/><br/>There are two playing boards in the game, featuring a Junkyard and a Dragstrip.<br/><br/>THE JUNKYARD<br/><br/>Players begin by stocking the junkyard board with all the parts for the Rat Rods. There are 4 disassembled vehicles whose components each have their own area. You choose where to place them.<br/><br/>Once the Junkyard has been stocked, players roll a dice to see who goes first and begin moving their tokens around the board, collecting all the necessary parts to build their vehicles.<br/><br/>There are four male and four female mechanic character tokens, allowing any combination of players. Parts must be collected in order, however players can choose which path to take to reach their favourite ones first. Depending upon which direction a player chooses to take, it will lead them to different types and styles of car parts within each category.<br/><br/>The aim is to get the parts you want first, before the others collect them. Different body types, different engines, blower styles and different wheel designs means loads of possible combinations.<br/><br/>The player that finishes their car first, takes pole position on the Dragstrip Board. As each of the other players finish, they take up the remaining positions in order. Positions on the grid determine the order of turn.<br/><br/>THE DRAGSTRIP<br/><br/>This is where the real race begins.<br/><br/>The highly detailed Dragstrip Board is one of the largest made, with interchangeable sections to make it as short or long as you want. It can be assembled to almost 3m in length.<br/><br/>The road ahead is filled with potential dangers, with an extra element where players get to place hazard cones at strategic locations to try and stop the other players from winning the race. Every time a player lands on a road hazard or cone, they draw an action card from the deck which could delay them, send them back or forward, or other unexpected outcomes.<br/><br/>Potential hazards along the way include potholes, radar traps, toxic chemical spills, oil slicks, loose car parts, and even quake damage. Remember too, that this is the Extraterrestrial Highway...so you never know what you might encounter during the race.<br/><br/>Every time a player lands on a Hazard space, they take a card from the Action deck. Sometimes it's good news, sometimes it's bad!<br/><br/>There are 30 different Action Cards included in the game, with a little humour thrown in, and all with a unique Retro look.<br/><br/>We also wanted to bring back the old school fun of a game spinner, so we've designed a custom &quot;Speed Dial&quot; which has multiple 10, 20 and 30 MPH markings on it. Each of these correspond with the gear you are in, 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, and players move one to three spaces accordingly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cybermythica: Loom of Fate is a strategy game set in the world of Cybermythica, a universe which is a kind of a hybrid between mythology and cyberpunk. Each player will lead one of four Megapolis Kronos Megacorps with varying abilities and starting units. The Goal standing before them is as bright as the glare of the Titan Helios &ndash; to do everything to make the thread of their lives the leading one in the history woven by the Loom of Fate.<br/><br/>This task won`t be easy when you live in Megapolis Kronos, a place ravaged by incessant conflict between two Conglomerates - Logos controlled by Zeus and Elysium controlled by his brother Hades. It&rsquo;s really like being between Scylla and Charybdis. The question is: whose side are you on, which strategy will you choose? Will you support the most influential of all G.O.D.S., Almighty Zeus, or maybe the Lord of the Dead, Hades? Or perhaps you will remain neutral in this conflict? Will you be able to convince Aristoi - best of the best of the residents of Megapolis Kronos - to give you their support? Will you be able to win the hearts of Megapolis&rsquo;s citizens? Maybe the path to achieve the goal goes through taking the control over Megapolis&rsquo;s sectors? Or maybe you will go down in history as the one who has tamed the powerful Ephemeris from the depths of Ether, and the memory about you will last forever? One goal, many roads.<br/><br/>The game is divided into Cycles (turns) during which players will perform actions using the resources they control &ndash; like Aristoi, Assets, special Techne cards, support and Ambrosia tokens. They will try to take control of Megapolis Kronos Sectors to get more support to fulfill contracts for large conglomerates (Logos and Elysium). Visit the special places to get Techne cards, recruit Aristoi, acquire Assets and even tame the powerful Ephemeris. Fight the other players in duels or carry out assaults against other players&rsquo; HQs. The purpose of these actions is to gain prestige in the eyes of the residents of Megapolis Kronos. The game ends when the fate token on the Loom of Fate reaches level 11 or higher and players will receive History points for all they have done during the game. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This appears to be an c. 1870s card game that elaborates on the basic Authors/Go Fish mechanic (asking other players for cards that complete sets). The box features a dull-colored lithograph of Niagara Falls. The cards are not illustrated and are square with plain white backs.<br/><br/>The game is undated and bears no copyright, patent or company name except a small white triangle containing the initials E.I.H. This suggests an early publication by E.I. Horsman, which started as a doll manufacturer in 1865 and by the mid-1880s was having a battle with Milton Bradley over the rights to Halma and was prominently displaying patents and copyrights on its boxes.<br/><br/>The card deck has 48 cards divided into 12 sets of four cards each. The 12 categories are: Great Poets; Great Dramatists; Great Historians; Great Painters; Great Musical Composers; Great Philosophers; Great Astronomers; Great Naval Commanders; Great Rulers; Great Pieces of Sculpture; Great Events; and Natural Wonders.<br/><br/>The main rules difference from Authors is that the sets are grouped into four trios. For instance, Poets, Dramatists and Historians form one of the trios. Winning two sets of a trio is worth three points instead of two, and winning all three is worth five points. Individual sets count a single point, but the person with the largest number of sets of any kind gets a two-point bonus. Most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This undated game from Rosebud Art Co. is a spin-and-move game with a mathematical twist that is not nearly as easy as it looks. The board consists of five concentric circles of numbers connected by paths. There are four color-coded spaces in the corners and four matching spaces numbered 66 at the center.<br/><br/>The number spaces range from minus 9 to plus 8. The spinner is unusual - it has 12 outcomes that include 2 x 0, 3 x 1, 2 x 2, 2 x 3, and one each of 4, 5 and 6. The rules say that after making a spin, each player must move his token that number of spaces, forwards, back or sideways.<br/><br/>The player must add or subtract the number in each space he passes or reaches and keep a cumulative total from one turn to the next. The winner is the first to successfully reach the 66 space of their color with a cumulative total of exactly 66.<br/><br/>A copy of the game from renowned collector Alex G. Malloy's estate includes a hand-written attribution of the cover art to Palmer Cox, the Canadian artist famous for his books and comics about Brownies. As Cox died in 1924, this implies an early-to-mid 1920s publication date.<br/><br/>",

Each box included a sheet with all the correct answers.<br/><br/>The cards were sold as a competitive party game, with guests vying to see who could name the most book titles correctly as the cards were displayed.

The box claims &quot;Patent No. 575&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules say the name is Spanish for &quot;a recoiling&quot; and the game consists of 9 wooden pins, 3&quot; tall, and a wooden ring. The eight yellow pins are set up in a square and the single black pin goes in the center of the square.<br/><br/>Players take turns propelling the ring by pushing down from the top so that it moves forward with a reverse spin, one that brings it back toward the player if it hits a pin. A player gets three shots, plus one more for each hit. Pins are reset for each player's turn.<br/><br/>Hitting a pin scores 10 for those in the rank nearest to him, 20 points for those on either side of the black &quot;king&quot; pin, and 40 points for those in the far rank. Hitting the &quot;king&quot;, however, wipes out his score and ends his turn. First player to reach 500 wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1948 title may be the earliest board game featuring the famous cat-and-mouse duo. Published by Milton Bradley under license from Loew's Inc. (owner of MGM), it is a spin-and-move game with a twist.<br/><br/>Each player has both a Tom and a Jerry character, and they move in opposite directions around the board. There also is a twin spinner, one for each character. Each players spins both dials on his turn. When both spinners hit the same number, both moves are doubled. First player to get both pieces round the board wins.<br/><br/>The game track includes three kinds of spaces: Cat, Mouse and star. What happens when two pieces meet depends on the space. Stars are safe spots. If two Toms meet on a Mouse space or two Jerrys on a Cat, both are sent home to start over. If a Tom and a Jerry meet, then Tom goes home on a Mouse space and Jerry goes home on a Cat.<br/><br/>The box and rules declare that &quot;This is a Psych Tested Game&quot;... whatever that means.<br/><br/>",

The box says it was produced in a limited edition and &quot;Created by a Vietnam Marine&quot;.<br/><br/>After each move, the player must draw from a deck of 124 cards. Most (82) require the player to ask a question of the player to his left, and if that player answers correctly, that player moves ahead the number of spaces on the card. There also are five &quot;fun&quot; cards, which ask &quot;no move or point&quot; questions like, &quot;If you were President, would you throw a lot of parties?&quot;<br/><br/>But the key to the game is the set of 37 issue cards. These ask questions such as &quot;If you were president, what would be your position on a national health plan?&quot; The player asked has up to 2 minutes to answer, and all players (including the answering one) then vote. If a majority approve, the answering player moves ahead the number of spaces on the card.<br/><br/>While the rules are written for 2-4 players, this would probably work better for somewhat larger groups, especially within a classroom.<br/><br/>",

In a basic game, victory is achieved by routing the enemy army or destroying it entirely.<br/><br/>It differs from the normal tabletop wargaming format by using an action point system, where a number of points are assigned to the player at the beginning of the turn by a dice roll. These actions are then used to activate army units, which can then choose from a number of actions to perform. Basic actions include moving, shooting and charging, but most units have their own unique actions, such as 'Shieldwall', which affect how they are used in the game, and command units have access to actions that affect other units, such as 'Rally'. This system adds an element of tactical depth whilst reducing the length of the game turn, making for quicker games.<br/><br/>A single book, called 'The Tome', is the only reference point for the game, and contains all the lore, rules, army lists and other information required to play the game.<br/><br/>",

The football field inset in the box is marked to individual yards, and has peg holes along the side to mark scores, quarters and downs. Other parts include a cardboard 10 yard marker, a plastic football and three dice.<br/><br/>Although each play requires a roll of the dice, with the total compared against a list of plays to determine net yards gained or lost, the key to the game lies in two sets of cards. The defensive player each play secretly chooses one of five formation cards (6-2-2-1, 6-3-2, 7-1-2-1, 8-3 or 5-3-2-1).<br/><br/>The offensive player then calls one of eight possible plays and turns over the top card from the 80-card play deck. Cross-referencing the play row with the defensive column provides a modifier to the die roll, as well as possible fumbles and interceptions.<br/><br/>",

The odd card is a portrait of Aesop himself, and all the artwork is fantastic.<br/><br/>All the cards are dealt out. The player to the left of the dealer takes one card from the player to his right (the dealer in this case) and then lays down in front of him as many pairs as possible. Each player in turn repeats until all pairs have been laid.<br/><br/>The Aesop card may be played at any time, and has the effect of doubling the number of matches beneath it. Winner is the player with the greatest number of matched pairs at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The box is undated, but Alex G. Malloy, American Games: Comprehensive Collector's Guide, dates it to 1890 (p. 34. #1001).<br/><br/>",

Fire Sale is a 2-4 player game featuring auction/bidding based dice placement/manipulation and set collection. Over multiple rounds players must use their dice rolls wisely to try and buy cards from the center of the table to earn sets that they can trade in for victory points!<br/><br/>The first player is chosen by whoever rolls the lowest amount of the lowest die value and on each turn a player has 7 possible actions to choose from, 5 being their available &quot;main&quot; actions and 2 being possible free actions. These actions include the ability to buy cards (to form sets), bid on cards against your opponents, play cards from your hand, turn in cards to earn points, or discard cards to get new cards in your hand. The free actions include re-rolling and &quot;flipping&quot; your dice. The game requires efficient use of a player's five dice that are rolled each round, in which &quot;opposite&quot; faced die are very valuable, though each player has ways to influence their dice rolls in tactical ways to suit their needs.<br/><br/>During the game players make moves with their dice, play cards from their hand, and turn in their collected sets for points. Players can use the point &quot;pool&quot; wisely to gain extra points while also blocking their opponents from gaining extra points.

Unlike similar games produced by Universal and Party Games Publishers, which usually used decks of 18 cards with single images, the Gibson Series 1 puts 2-3 drawings on each of its 12 cards, for a total of 33 images.<br/><br/>Assuming 4, 8 or 12 players, the cards are then dealt out evenly to players, who get 1.5 minutes to guess the answers on their card(s). When time is up, they pass their cards to the players next to them. Once the cards have made the rounds, the player with the most correct answers wins.<br/><br/>In addition, this title uses the backs of the puzzle cards to offer a second game, Pennies. Each card has 12 clues starting &quot;This PENNY...&quot; and providing a blank where the answer is a word starting with the letters P-E-N. For example, the answer to &quot;This PENNY gets in&quot; is &quot;PENetrate&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This undated but early baseball game by Milton Bradley is a spin-and-move affair. The two players race from home plate around the bases and back to home on a field glued to the box bottom.<br/><br/>There are 8 spaces on each side of the diamond plus the squares for the bases. Each side has a red circle, which causes a player landing there to lose a turn. The three bases and home plate must be reached by exact spin.<br/><br/>Using a 4-space spinner, players must spin a 3 to start the game, but go directly to first base if they spin 4 three times before getting a 3.<br/><br/>There also are four hazard spaces on each track. The first, right after 2nd base, means a player is out (and starts over). The second and third, on the final leg, send the player back to third base. And the heartbreaking fourth, on the last space before winning, means the player is out at home.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This turn of the 20th century educational game has a deck of 48 cards. Each card has between one and four geographical features listed, including continents, countries, rivers, mountains, and cities. Under each feature name is a list of questions to which that feature is the answer.<br/><br/>Cards are dealt out evenly among the players. The first player chooses a question on one of his cards and asks the player to his left for an answer. If the player cannot answer, he gives up a card to the questioner, who sets it aside. The questioner then moves to the next player with the same or a different question with the same answer and continues until someone answers correctly. If no one answers, the questioner sets it aside for himself and chooses a new card. When a question is answered correctly, the questioner surrenders a card to the answerer and the questioner's turn ends.<br/><br/>All cards won are set aside and out of the game. When all of the cards have been claimed, the player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>Alex G. Malloy in American Games: Comprehensive Collector's Guid (1999) dates this game as circa 1890s, but the deck includes two cards with questions about the &quot;murderous revolt against Christian civilization&quot; and the capture of Pekin by &quot;American and allied troops&quot;, both in 1900. Another card refers to Cuba as a country rather than a Spanish colony, and the game includes an ad for the &quot;fine new games&quot; of The Comical Game of Who (1899) and Sir Hinkle Funnyduster (1903), with the latter providing the likely publication date of this game as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a paper and pencil party game designed to be played in a large gathering, generally in tables of four with players on opposite sides acting as partners. The objective is to draw the creature shown on the score sheet. Two creatures are available, a giraffe and a penguin. The game includes 25 player sheets, each with squares for 12 drawings.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling a die, with each number corresponding to a particular part of the creature's body. A roll of 6 is needed to start a drawing, and when one is rolled, both partners can draw the body. A five must be rolled next, and again allows both partners to draw the head. After that, each partner rolls only for his own drawing.<br/><br/>The first player to complete a drawing yells &quot;Gooffy&quot; and the players then tally their individual scores (one point per body part). The two highest scorers move to the next table for another round, and the game continues for as many as 12 rounds. The player with the highest total points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>The giraffe needs a tail (4), a neck (3), two ears and an eye (2) and four legs (1). The penguin needs a beak (4), one eye (3), two feet (2) and two flippers (1). Each roll only allows one of the corresponding parts to be added.<br/><br/>",

Players would be competing to gain favorable building contracts, build up the city, making sound financial investments as well as making financial contribution to impress the town council and mayor.<br/><br/>Club Town is a unique town building game that uses trick taking as its main action selection mechanic. Heavily inspired by Hearts and Diamonds (designer: Mike Fitzgerald), each suit is will have its associated action and players will need to take stock of what has been dealt to them, plan their strategy and out-think their opponent to be the most prestigious firm in town.<br/><br/>In a trick, each player would play a card following the lead and the suit would determine the action a player may take and the value determines how much money or investment opportunities may be gained or spent during the action: Spades to build buildings, Hearts to gain investor prospects, Clubs to earn income and Diamonds to invest in buildings. Being the leader would allow you control what everyone may do, but watch out as someone might pair their card with Influence (Joker) card to trump yours instead.<br/><br/>The game ends in four rounds running the whole poker deck twice and the prestige would be gained from buildings, their own investments in buildings and having the majority in favors in the Town Hall. May you be the one who outsmarts your friends and gain the highest prestige to be declared the prime developer in town!<br/><br/>",

The more powerful the people is, the more new citizens will come to Athens, but they will only come to the most influential demagogue.<br/><br/>The player who first plays all of his or her citizens to Athens wins.<br/><br/>Demokratia is played in rounds divided into five phases:<br/><br/>1) Rhetorics: Argue, negotiate and bribe for your cause.<br/>2) Ekklesia (Assembly): Play secret votes.<br/>3) Archon: Play citizens to the city of Athens OR to<br/>the Boule (Council) OR to a Monument/Rhetor.<br/>4) Phylai: Reveal votes and distribute new citizens.<br/>5) Ostracism: Play citizens to temporarily exile a demagogue.<br/><br/>The players take turns to play their citizens to Athens. During each round, the power and the influence will rise and fall.<br/><br/><br/>     The colors of the cast votes and the erected buildings in Athens determine the tribe power, which in turn determine how many new citizens will come to Athens.<br/>     The citizens in the Boule determine the tribe influence, which in turn determine the share of the new citizens each player will get.<br/>     The players may also claim Monuments or Rhetors, each with a unique ability to influence the democratic game.<br/><br/><br/>To win Demokratia, you must not only favor your own tribes but also maintain your influence over them so that no other player grow more influential and gets the power of your effort.<br/><br/>Demokratia is a double majority game, where you must be the strongest in the strongest tribe.

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Politeia takes the players back to the Persian Wars. Faced with the threat of a Persian invasion, the players must cooperate to defend their civilization. However, the competition for wealth and resources is fierce, as simulated by an inventive action mechanism, and just like the Ancient Greeks, the players are likely to turn their weapons against each other instead.<br/><br/>The different player actions add talents from the stock to the hand and turn those talents into citizens on the board, engaging in peaceful trading or aggressive warfare. Once a player run out of stock, the player with the most citizens left on the board wins.<br/><br/>The game board consists of tiles representing city-states, colonies and diplomatic positions. The player markers represent either talents or citizens and control of the board is determined by area majority.<br/><br/>The players take turns to select actions from a common mancala style action board. They pick up the action markers in one action space and drop them one by one in the spaces of the actions they wish to take, paying a cost equal to the number of action markers already in there.<br/><br/>The actions can broadly be divided into four groups:<br/><br/>1) Acquire talents, either directly through taxes and levies or indirectly through import of resources that can later be exchanged for talents.<br/>2) Invest talents in buildings, providing action benefits, or diplomacy, providing war benefits.<br/>3) Turn talents into citizens, either to consolidate existing city-states or to expand to new city-states.<br/>4) Use citizens to attack other players or defend against the Persians.<br/><br/>The more citizens a player gets to the board, the more talents he or she may generate but the greater the risk if the Persians invade.<br/><br/>The unique action mechanism allows the player to optimize action combinations while at the same time blocking other players' actions by making them more expensive. This opens up several strategic paths, spanning from slow engine building to sudden seizures of area majorities. All game elements have a historical background, making Politeia a game of traditional Euro mechanisms linked by a strong theme.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a roll and move game across a map of the world divided into a grid 52 spaces wide (E-W) and 33 spaces deep (N-S). There are four start spaces, two on each of the east and west edges, and travellers (wooden triangles) must use a variety of vehicles (wooden cubes and cylinders) to get to the opposite edge of the board and on the other side of the equator.<br/><br/>Sea squares are blue, with some light blue squares that are impassable. Land squares are green, red, yellow or purple. There are eight modes of transportation, each restricted by color: cars and trains (green); aeroplanes (green, red and cross-hatched yellow, blue or purple; horses (red); camels (yellow), porters and pack animals (purple); and vessels (blue). These are scattered across the map on designated squares at the start of the game.<br/><br/>Players throw three dice on their turn. The red die and one white die are normal D6, the second white die is directional (N,S,E,W, and two blanks). Travellers must be on some form of transportation to move, and the white dice determine how many squares and in which direction (blanks are player's choice). The red die is used to move empty vehicles to where the traveller can intercept them and change modes. Players must move the full amount unless it brings them to a terrain border, and must change modes if they encounter an unoccupied vehicle.<br/><br/>Although the game is undated, it appears to be a 1930s design, since aeroplanes can only move short distances across water (Mediterranean, Caribbean, SE Asia) and not across oceans. Also, as common in the 1930s, the game comes in a small box with a separate board.<br/><br/>",

The box includes eight character cards, a deck of 48 trivia question and answer cards, party invitations and envelopes with &quot;an offer you can't refuse&quot;, menu cards, a background booklet that includes recipes for the menu dishes and even a CD of appropriate music. The dinner allegedly takes place at Scarpato's Restaurant on Coney Island in 1931.<br/><br/>The character cards include Al Capone and his ardently churchgoing wife Mae, along with Meyer Lansky and his new, skinny, pregnant and na&iuml;ve Italian bride Anna Citron. Each of these cards includes characteristics, background information and suggested topics to guide play: Mae is violently allergic to dust, while Anna speaks only broken English and thinks words like &quot;mob&quot; and &quot;burial&quot; are management talk from her consultant husband.<br/><br/>Like many party games, the primary goal is mutual amusement and there are no specific rules for winning. Clearly the person answering the most trivia questions correctly could be declared a winner of that activity, and there might be a vote on best character acting.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an undated space travel game from Belgium that combines roll-and-move with resource management. The board covers the solar system, and the goal is to accumulate the most money primarily by being the first to land on planets. Landing bonuses range from 100 million for the moon to 1,000 million for Pluto, and there are game end bonuses for last planet, each planet card and most planet cards.<br/><br/>The standard red interplanetary track includes hazards that can bump players onto a useless green track. The red track leads to yellow orbital tracks around each planet, which in turn link to white landing tracks. Players must try to hit cross-over and landing points precisely, and can be damaged or even killed if they land too fast.<br/><br/>On each turn, players declare their acceleration and pay the appropriate amount of fuel, from 1 tonne for 1D6 to 32 tonnes for 6D6. Players may instead spend 5 tonnes for a retro thrust (1D6-3) or 20 tonnes for a super-retro (1D6 in reverse). Players may also spend money for help from an &quot;electronic brain&quot; that allows movement of exactly 1 in either direction for 50 million up to 4 for 400 million.<br/><br/>Players can buy fuel cheaply while on a planet or at double price at any time. It also can be had for free by landing on a space station (25t) and by giving up a turn while on a planet or station (10t). Players can borrow money from the bank if necessary to buy fuel.<br/><br/>The rules are in Flemish and French, and while the game is undated, the box graphic looks a lot like the space ship from the Tintin graphic novels.<br/><br/>",

For example, the Flip card requires a coin toss, the results of which determine who must draw two cards. The Trade card provides the option of trading hands with another player. The Grab card is a mad grab for spoons (one less than the number of players), with the empty-handed player required to draw two cards. The dreaded Spoiler card can be a major roadblock to winning. The unpredictability these cards bring to Ultra 7 lend it an exciting playfulness that make for a rip-roaring good time.<br/><br/>",

There is a deck of 26 Blackout cards, each with a six-letter word on one side, and an irregular inkblot on the other side. There is a second deck of 70 game cards, each of which has a pattern of holes punched through the card.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player takes one of the blackout word cards and places the pattern side underneath the game card. The number of black dots showing is the number of letters in that word card that appear in the game card's word.<br/><br/>Using a scorecard that lists each of the 26 word cards, the player must try one word card after another to determine the six letters represented by his game card, and then work out the right order for the actual word.<br/><br/>The rules provide 5 variants for two players, two variants for party fun, and one for solitaire. In head-to-head play, the player who takes the most cards to succeed loses points equal to his number of turns minus the number taken by his opponent, plus a flat penalty of 3 points for losing. First player to 50 points loses the game.<br/><br/>",

Well this game lets you do it, too!  The goal of the game is to overdraw your checking amount by more than your opponent(s).<br/><br/>Set up the game by placing the numbered cards in 11 face down stacks according to the numbers printed on them (2-12).  The numbers corresponds to the following political job titles: 2 Vice President, 3  President for a Day, 4  Retiring Politician, 5  Cabinet Member, 6  Incumbent Politician, 7  House of Representatives, 8  Politician's Aid, 9  Diplomat, 10  Senator, 11  Political Appointee, and 12 White House Chief of Staff.<br/><br/>During their turn, players roll the dice and take a card matching the number.  The cards instruct the player to record a debit (subtraction) or a credit (addition) in their check register.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has a full check register page - 20 items.  The winner with the highest overdraft wins!<br/><br/>",

In addition, players have to explain their comparisons in the form of some sort of punch line. For example, &ldquo;parents are like boogers &hellip; always hanging around making you look like a fool&rdquo; or &ldquo;parents are like belts &hellip; supportive.&rdquo; Here&rsquo;s the catch, the key word revealed on the drawn card must be compared to a certain letter word. Rolling the 20 sided die will dictate the starting letter of a word. In the aforementioned example, the key word was &ldquo;parents&rdquo; and the letter &ldquo;B&rdquo; was rolled to come up with the words &ldquo;boogers&rdquo; and &ldquo;belts&rdquo;. Notice the dot dot dot (&hellip;) in the example? It&rsquo;s called an ELLIPSIS. Each player will write their own witty, humorous, or even barbed punch line following the ELLIPSIS. Players earn points for guessing who said what.<br/><br/>",

There are three of each in three colors (black, white and orange. There also is a set of 40 Oh Peg It cards, each with a familiar saying that swaps out a word and replaces it with &quot;peg&quot;, and instructions for gaining or losing spaces or points. There is a set of 200 small dried beans as scoring tokens.<br/><br/>A player takes either a set of pegs or one of circles, and rolls one die per turn. He may split the roll between two pieces. If a peg and circle land on the same space, both players score: the pegger (piece landing) gets two points and the player pegged gets one point. The game ends when one player reaches the end of the track with all his pieces, and the winner is the one with the most points at that time.<br/><br/>There are three kinds of special spaces: Double Score does just that for both players pegging on one; Oh Peg It means taking a card from the deck and following instructions; and Chastity Square means no pegging here!<br/><br/>The sexual allusions in this Summer of Love era game are pretty obvious throughout. Aside from the male-female pegging mechanism, the cards also include sayings like &quot;I could have pegged all night&quot;, &quot;We'd rather peg than fight&quot;, and &quot;Pegging makes the heart grow fonder&quot;. A second deck of blank cards is provided for those who want to get more daring or creative.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>Tobi-Sugoroku is a traditional Japanese game developed from the original game Joudo-Sugoroku. Tobi means 'Jumping', and as in Joudo-Sugoroku, players move differently across the board using dice rolls and following the instructions on the squares. As with other classical Japanese games, the original designers' and illustrators are not known.<br/><br/>However, later Tobi-Sugoroku do not keep the Buddhist theme, and instead reflect various popular subjects (New Year, ghosts and monsters, warriors and heroes, morality). This allowed the publishers to produce beautifully illustrated prints in the Edo period, and 19C and 20C magazines to have Sugoroku games as cheap pull-outs.<br/><br/>The main difference between Tobi-Sugoroku and Mawari-Sugoroku is that in the former, movement is across the network of squares, whereas in the latter, movement is along a controlled path (similar to Game of Goose). Any Sugoroku game with pictures is known as E-Sugoroku (E- means 'picture').<br/><br/>",

It has French and English instructions printed on the inside of the box lid. The board is a large fabric mat, 30&quot; square, with a big circle and the game name in the center. Each side has a space for one playing card and a series of circles numbered 1 through 9.<br/><br/>On each turn, the dealer deals one card face up to each player. The player then uses chips to cover up any combination of circles that add up to the value of the card (1 for Ace through 13 for King).<br/><br/>Rounds continue until one player manages to cover all nine of his circles. Any player unable to cover circles equal to his card must put a chip in the pot. When the Joker turns up, the dealer reshuffles the full deck and starts a new turn beginning with the player dealt the Joker.<br/><br/>The first player to cover all nine circles wins the pot. In addition, each other player must pay him the value of their remaining uncovered circles.<br/><br/>",

The words range in length from two to eight letters. Some of the words start with capital letters, and there are some chips with endings like -ing and with punctuation marks.<br/><br/>The game is clearly educational in nature, flowing from Milton Bradley's devotion to that cause starting in the late 1860s. While undated, the plain box and cardboard word chips suggest 19th Century publication. The box is labelled with the address of the company's Boston office at 120 Boylston St. rather than the usual Springfield factory location.<br/><br/>The goal is to form coherent sentences from selections of words from the box, but absent a copy of the rules, it is not clear how word cards are picked or distributed.<br/><br/>",

Each arrow takes one move, and the possibility to win is equal on all routes.<br/><br/>When a steamboat docks at a port, the player hands over the corresponding &quot;Shipping Manifest&quot; card to deliver the products, taking in exchange the &quot;Shipping Orders&quot; card for that specific port.<br/><br/>In the case that a steamboat has to go back to a port because of some fog, an engine malfunction, etc. on route (see obstacle rules at the bottom right of the map), the player cannot take or deliver merchandise.<br/><br/>The game ends when all steamboats are back to their ports of origin.

        "description": "Pocket Rivals Strategy Card Game first edition comes with two 9-card 'deck' teams: Monsters Vs Robots. The game is designed for 2 players and is friendly for ages 8 and up. The first player to reduce their opponent's team of 9 cards to a single card left on the playing field is the winner.<br/><br/>Pocket Rivals Strategy Card Game playing field is a 3 x 6 grid with room for a single card within each grid space. The board is placed between the two players who face each other across the longest edges of the board. Each of the two players has 9 cards. Each card has stats for Power, Wits, Charm, &amp; Speed arranged on the top, Left, Right, &amp; bottom sides respectively. Each stat is printed with a value from 1 to 4.<br/><br/>Starting from a random arrangement of all 18 cards on the grid, players take turns removing one another's cards via a  'challenge' mechanism that compares stats on adjacent cards.<br/><br/>On a given turn, players activate a single card from their team on the field. They may move that card (one space in a cardinal direction), challenge an adjacent card (removing it from the field), and use the unique 'talent' ability associated with their activated card. The player may do up to all three of these actions in a single turn in any order. Gameplay continues with the players alternating turns until one team has been reduced to a single card.<br/><br/>Each card features a single character.  The front of the card is Gallery Mode: full color art with the character name. The back of the card is Challenge Mode: single color gradient art, character talent, and a yellow rim containing a stat for each edge of the card.<br/><br/>The story conceit behind the game is that each player is an Ace Tactician who has selected 9 Ally Champions from across a myriad of Pocket Dimensions to face off against 9 Rivals and a Rival Ace.

The sheet has 18 holes with values ranging from 5 to 100.<br/><br/>Players take turns spinning their tops and recording the value each time it stops. First player to 500 points wins.<br/><br/>The earliest version of this game has a box cover showing two children playing the game on a small table, with a rural landscape seen through the window behind them. While the game is undated, the style of the graphics and the &quot;Bradley's Best Games&quot; logo on the box suggests a 19th Century or early 20th Century publication date.<br/><br/>",

Wooden pegs are used to keep score along ladders of holes punched into the board.<br/><br/>The game is played in five rounds, each of which requires a succession of physical moves. In the first round, for instance, cubes are placed on each of four stars on the board, and the player must toss the dart in the air, pick up a cube and catch the dart all with the same hand. This is then repeated for the second cube, then the remaining two cubes, and then all four cubes at once. Finally, the dart must be tossed up and hit the blue circle in the center of the board.<br/><br/>Each player turn lasts until he fails to complete a required trick. When his turn comes again, he starts with the failed trick. First player to complete the requirements of all five rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1978 educational firefighting game has a playing board, a deck of 34 Fire cards, a deck of 32 Result cards, four Patrol Piece tokens, four badge cards (Chief, Captain, Engineer and Rookie), a D6 with a fire symbol over the 1, and an unpainted lead firetruck.<br/><br/>The board has a white track running around the edge, and an inner pattern of six vertical and two horizontal streets, connected to the fire station in the middle. In between the streets are numbered houses, retail outlets and industrial locations.<br/><br/>Each player starts on a different corner of the board and rolls the die to move along the white track on the outside of the board. Each time he passes his starting station, he completes one patrol. The last player to complete his third patrol gets stuck with the Rookie badge.<br/><br/>Whenever a player lands on a &quot;fire&quot; space, he draws the top card from the Fire deck, which illustrates the cause of the fire and gives a location. The player then has four rolls of the die to move the fire engine from the station to that location to put out the fire. If he succeeds, he draws a Results card and follows directions; if not, he moves his piece back one space.<br/><br/>The game is said to have been designed by a firehouse in Scottsdale, Arizona, and the box shows it was distributed as an educational tool through other fire departments. (One copy has a label saying &quot;Compliments of Roy L. Parrish, Fire Chief, Clark County Fire Dept., Nevada&quot;.)<br/><br/>",

The board has three concentric rings of spaces (Qualifying, Bronze and Silver) with a large Gold Medal space in the middle. There is a deck of 56 cards, each with six questions and answers (one for each of six color-coded categories).<br/><br/>Players roll a die and must first complete a full circuit of the outer track, answering a question of the appropriate color as they land on each space. Then they must aim for a Qualify space, where they must answer a question of another player's choice from the next card in order to move to the Bronze track.<br/><br/>Similarly, players must move around the Bronze track before trying to move up to Silver, and around that track before trying for a Gold Medal question to win the game. The questions range from familiar (&quot;Name all five events in the modern Olympic Pentathlon&quot;) to the obscure (&quot;Which snooker player was able to claim pints of lager as tax-deductible?&quot;).<br/><br/>The game box included an opportunity to enter a real contest to win tickets to five premier sporting events in late 1987 and 1988.<br/><br/>",

A spinner counts as zero, while double spinners allows you to discard all of the cards of one value from your hand (your choice). If you roll and have no matches, you must draw a new card. When it is your turn, instead of rolling you can use the die roll of the person before you, but must roll if the previous player did not roll.<br/><br/>Play continues (roll dice, discard if you can, draw if you can't) until one player has successfully discarded all of their cards. Everyone totals the remaining value of the cards in front of them, adds that to their own score, and a new round begins. After ten rounds, the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 800 A.D: the dawn of the Viking Age.  For the next three centuries, explorers, warriors, traders, and builders will sail from Scandinavia to stake their claims across the globe.  They are bold, ruthless, and utterly fearless.  You are now one of them.  You and your family will make a noble name as the world burns.<br/><br/>' Valhalla I Am Coming!' is played in 10 turns, each turn representing roughly 30 years, or one generation. Players start with control of one Viking, but will come to control that Viking&rsquo;s entire family as spouses are courted and children are born.  On each turn, players will explore, fight, settle, and build their families, often confronting death or injury and winning glory for their accomplishments. The player who has accumulated the most glory at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>The gameplay is straightforward, with action points being spent, skill checks being made, and tables being rolled upon.  The objectives of the design are fun, collaborative storytelling, and historical understanding.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This undated but circa 1920s game is simple dice-driven horse race played on a two-part metal track. Six metal horses and two metal hurdles are also included. The metal seems to be the selling point, since the box declares &quot;As played on Ocean Liners&quot;, and both the box and board graphics feature ships and shipboard play of a shuffleboard-sized version of the game.<br/><br/>The 16-space U-shaped track has six lanes. Each horse is assigned the number on a D6 corresponding to its lane. In the standard game, each player throws three dice, with each horse moving one space for each time its die number appears.<br/><br/>The rules, printed on the metal board, provide for a steeplechase version, where the two metal hurdles are placed on designated spaces and require two of the three dice to show the horse's number to pass. They also provide for a &quot;fast game&quot; where one die determines the horse and a second die how many spaces it moves. And finally there are rules for a &quot;slow race&quot;, where the last horse wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a two-player Soviet-era wargame played with plastic game pieces on a map with an 8 x 12 square grid. Each player receives 11 pieces: five soldiers, five tanks, and one missile launcher. The map graphics include a road, a railway, towns, bridges, a river, streams, swamps, lakes, woods and many contour lines, but these play no role in the game. The only relevant markings are the diagonal lines across the middle two rows, which is a neutral zone or &quot;no-man's land&quot;.<br/><br/>Players may set up their pieces freely on their side of the neutral zone. They move alternately, one piece at a time, and each piece may move only a single space orthogonally.<br/><br/>A piece captures an enemy piece by moving next to it, but the required direction changes depending on the nature mix of pieces. Like pieces (infantry vs. infantry, tank vs. tank) can capture from any of the four directions. Infantry can only kill a tank from its side or rear. A tank can only kill infantry if the target is directly in front of it. The missile launcher may kill any one piece at any distance, but then turns into another tank.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to get a piece onto his opponent's back row. The game says it is for children aged 7 to 10.<br/><br/>",

In this game of power and conquest, terminate your opponents and gain enough glory points to become the master of the new world.<br/><br/>Player takes turn in Clockwise order, until one player successfully gathers 16 stars(points). On a player's turn, he takes one of the two options: (a) move his pawn one space and gather power cubes, or (b) consume power cubes to damage any targeted opposing player, which will collect stars.<br/><br/>I) MOVING AND COLLECTING POWER. The player MUST move one space in any of the SIX directions, and if landing on a space with a power cube, the player has three options: (a) collect 3 power cubes of the different color, (b) collect 2 power cubes of same color, (c) collect 1 power cube of any color. If the player lands on a EMPTY space, he MUST refills power cubes from the power-line by dropping ONE power cube into every empty space on the board, from TOP to BOTTOM and from LEFT to RIGHT. Optionally, before moving his pawn, the player can discard one power cube of any color in his possession, to JUMP ONE SPACE AHEAD.<br/><br/>II) ATTACKING and EARNING STARS. The player attacks by discarding a number of power cubes equivalent in color to another players STAR CARDS, beginning with CARD-STAR1. He may combine his power cubes together with POWER TECHNIQUES he has earned during the course of the game. If the player successfully fulfill the power cubes matching an opponent's STAR CARD, he discards those matching power cubes and the opponent will take DAMAGE based on the number of STARS in the card. A damage is taken by discarding power cubes of ANY COLOR from any of the 3 EXPERIENCE METER in the PLAYER BOARD.<br/><br/>JUST BEFORE (I) or (II) , the player has the option to UPGRADE any of his 3 EXPERIENCE METER on his player board. To do so, he places any number of IDENTICAL COLOR CUBES into a METER of SIMILAR COLOR. If the METER wishing to upgrade is EMPTY, then any color can be added. The EXPERIENCE METER will allow the player to Learn up to 3 POWER TECHNIQUES, as well as giving bonus actions if reaching 100%.<br/><br/>",

The game is over when the auction stack is out of horse cards.

Bid as high as you dare &ndash; you know the range but the horse&rsquo;s actual value is kept a secret until the winning bid has been paid!<br/>Everyone can enter the shows and choosing the right horse will give you an advantage but anyone could steal the win if luck is on their side.<br/><br/>The junior edition features less horses resulting in a short game as well as some other game rules geared towards a younger audience<br/><br/>",

It is set in a fictional world, but it uses many familiar medieval tones. The players assume the roles of the kings, and must build their armies while at the same time preventing the other kings from building theirs.<br/>  The game consists of two decks of cards; one primarily used to build your army and the other used for attacks and other actions.  Overture of Kings requires strategy and planning, but there are elements that involve the luck of the draw and die rolls.<br/>  There are two player decks designed around the same rules and full games which are more complex and take longer to play.  Also, there are Alliance game rules around which tournament play has evolved  Included in the game are two types of optional cards that will either make the game easier for new players, extend the length of the round or both.  It takes between 30 minutes to 2 hours to play a round depending on the optional cards used and the experience levels of the players.<br/>  Overture of Kings is easy to learn, family friendly and fun.  There is a quick start guide to help new players understand the basics quickly as well as a full rule book for more detailed explanations of the game.<br/><br/>",

The game is printed on a single 14.75&quot; x 9&quot; sheet of paper, with attractive color graphics representing the continents of Europe, Africa, America, Asia and Australia. (America is shown as the land of tall buildings and money.)<br/><br/>Despite the graphics, the game is really one of abstract strategy. The board consists of two concentric circles, with tripled lines around the circumference of each circle and across two diameters at right angles. There are nine circles (numbered 1 to 9) at the resulting intersections, with 1 at the center (Europe), 2-5 on the middle ring, and 6-9 on the outer ring (the four other continents).<br/><br/>The rules say to use a bowl of nuts to keep score, and players must agree beforehand on how many nuts will be required to win. They draw lots for turn order, and must place their token on a continent (the center or an outer circle). Each player in turn must move his token one space to an adjacent open circle. If no adjacent circles are open, he loses his turn.<br/><br/>The objective is to move one's token into the center circle as often as possible, collecting a nut each time. The first player to reach the agreed target wins.<br/><br/>",

Using test-driven development, you will create user stories, test other players&rsquo; user stories and integrate components to<br/>earn victory points. The game can be used to teach agile testing but also works without its theme as an economic engine game.<br/><br/>You earn victory points in different categories but it is the points in your weakest category that determine the winner.<br/><br/>Code is represented by colored cubes and components by tiles with slots for input code and output code. The players take turns to perform one of the following tasks:<br/><br/>1. Program: Take code/s or exchange for victory points.<br/>2. Model: Play one user story. The expected output is chosen by you and known to all players but the required input as per the user story is only known by you.<br/>3. Develop: Play two input codes on Another player&rsquo;s user story. If you fail, try again next turn. The other player gets codes equal to the color of the input. If you pass, you get victory points equal to the color of the output.<br/><br/>Once a component is developed (i.e. both input and output is known), it becomes a component that can be integrated with other components and share code with each other so that the output of one component is used as input for other components. By integrating components in this way, you get victory points equal to the color of half the output. The bigger the module, the more victory points you earn.<br/><br/>The challenge of Find the Bug! - Agile is to find the right code for the right user story and plan your gameplay so that the code received from your current task can be used for the<br/>next task.<br/><br/>The unique mechanism of Find the Bug! - Agile is the way code flows between components, challenging the players not only to find the right code but also to plan forward so that they<br/>have the right code at the right time.<br/><br/>",

Each card has four questions, each followed by its answer, with a black line surrounding the text near the card's edges.<br/><br/>Players take two cards to start, with the remainder placed face down to form a draw deck. Each player in turn asks a question from one of his cards to the player on his left. If that player answers, he takes the card and places it in front of him. If he cannot, each other player in turn has an opportunity to answer and take the card. If no one answers correctly, the asking player gets to place it in front of himself. Whenever a card is taken, it is replaced from the draw deck, and the turn passes.<br/><br/>Some sample questions and answers:<br/><br/>What river is said to drive more mills and factories than any other river in the world? The Merrimac.<br/>The exports of what city are ten times the value of its imports? New Orleans.<br/>What city in New York is the largest cheese market in the Union?

If he swings, rolls 1D6: matching the pitch number is a square hit; rolling an adjacent number is a weak hit.<br/><br/>On a hit, player rolls 3D6 for a weak hit and 4D6 for a square hit. The total indicates a location on the field, each of which is either an out or has a picture of a die with a target number from 2 to 6. The defending player rolls a D6, and if he rolls &gt;= the target number, the player is out. If not, the batter gets at least one base. The defender rolls again, adding the result to the previous, and if the total still fails to reach the target number, the runner gets another base and a third roll is made. Batting totals of 19, 22 and 24 are home runs.<br/><br/>The unique feature of the game is that it is designed to be played with regular baseball trading cards, so that players can use their favorite real-life players in their line-ups and keep statistics on their performance over a season. The game includes 18 generic cards (2 for each position) that can be used as is, or customized with names.<br/><br/>There are additional rules for double and triple plays, sacrifice bunts, base stealing, clutch pitching and slugging.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The hilarious card game where you assign drinks, steal from others, have blackouts and even an occasional drunken hookup. Beer! also tests your knowledge with crazy categories like Types of Liquor, Cartoon Dogs, and Excuses for Not Making Love. If you win, you get to assign LOTS of drinks to the other players!<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>Object: To end a game with the highest cumulative number of drinks on the drink cards in your hand<br/><br/>Setup: Deal each player five cards. Place the rest of<br/>the deck face down in the center of the table.<br/><br/>Play: A player begins a turn by either &quot;knocking&quot; (see below) or by playing a card After a card is played, take the appropriate action, then the player draws a replacement card. The player to the left of the dealer takes the first turn and play continues clockwise around the table. Stack the played cards in a pile face up next to the draw pile<br/><br/>Card Values: If you play a drink card (One, Two Three, Four, or Six Drinks), assign that number of drinks to a player. Play a Social card and everyone drinks. For Blackout, select a player to lose a turn. If you play Steal, take a card from the player of your choice. (Don't look at the other player's hand and she draws a replacement card, you do not.) For the Drunken Hookup card, you select two players who either kiss or drink three drinks each (they decide)<br/><br/>Category Cards: If you play a category card, select one of the categories on the card and announce it to the group. Players then take turns naming items that fit into that category. You name the first item, then continue around the table until a player either repeats an item or cannot think of anything else that fits in the category. Allow 10 seconds per turn. The person<br/>making the mistake takes a drink<br/><br/>Knocking: If a player knocks instead of playing a card, that is the signal that the player wants to end the round. Each player following the knocker gets one last turn, then everyone shows their hands. Add up your cumulative drinks by counting the number of drinks on each drink card in your hand. The player with the highest number wins the round. you knock but do not win, take five penalty drinks. (Note: the round also ends if you reach the end of the deck and no one has knocked.)<br/><br/>Assigning Drinks: The winner hands out his drink cards to whomever he chooses. Drink the number of drinks on each card that is given to you. (lf players tie each winner assigns only three drink cards.)<br/><br/>",

Aged 10+.<br/><br/>There are three ways to start the game. Based on your cards, you decide and call whether you play: TOP, FLOPP or Chance. If you call TOP you must win each round and all other players will try to trump whereas in a FLOPP round you must lose each round and all other players will try not to trump. If you win a TOP or FLOPP you gain points but if you lose all others get points. When calling Chance you just play a card, which can be trumped or not and everyone has the chance to gain points. The player who trumped then gets to call TOP, FLOPP or Chance&hellip; The player who reached the winning amount of points (depending on the number of players) wins the game.<br/><br/>Playing time varies depending on the number of players or the amount of winning points you decide on. reviewers and testplayers played from 15 minutes up to 5 hours (with many rounds and special self-invented challenges for winners or losers ;-).<br/><br/>Reviewers and testplayers say Top Flopp is similar to Swiss/German/Austrian traditional card games like Jassen, Schnellen, Schnalzen... and is most fun with 3 or 4 players.<br/><br/>",

You will need that power to fight The Nightmare Invader - an evil entity who is trying to take control of all the guests by giving them terrifying nightmares.<br/><br/>To win the game, first you must wake up as many guests as you can before the invader drives them insane with terror.  Then you will take the fight to the invader, trying to drive it out of the mind of its human host, or destroying it completely.  But it will not be easy.  The invader is completely alien, and uses deckbuilding to achieve its goals.  Meanwhile you must use six sided dice to achieve yours.<br/><br/>The Invader gets the first turn.  On the Invader turn you draw 3 cards from the Invader deck, each showing a different fear, such as Ghosts or Spiders.  Any guests afraid of these fears become panicked.  If the Invader can panic a guest 5 times before you wake them, they succumb to the will of the Invader and their card is added to the Invader deck, making it stronger.<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll 6 dice.  Each die can be used once.  If a die roll is high enough, you can use it to calm down a guest and if you calm the guest completely, they wake up and are removed from play.  Dice can also be used to learn extra skills and abilities, such as removing the Invader's health, or adding distractions to the Invader deck.<br/><br/>It's a battle of dice versus cards.  Do you have what it takes to save humanity and defeat The Nightmare Invader?<br/><br/>",

It is undated, but c. 1930 judging by title's declaration of ocean-crossing as dangerous and by the artwork featuring a combination of biplanes, single-engine monoplane seaplanes and a trimotor.<br/><br/>The game board is a map covering Northern, Central and Western Europe and the East Coast of North America. The board is dotted with 58 small circles with the numbers 5, 10, 15 or 20. Six of these circles are bordered in red, meaning negative points for crashing; the remaining 52 are black and give positive points.<br/><br/>The playing pieces are cardboard planes attached to small wooden balls. The shooting mechanism is a 5&quot;-long cardboard springboard painted with a plane taking off. It has a wooden fulcrum near one end. Players put a plane on the long end and push down on the short end to launch it. It gains or loses points based on where it lands on the board. The player gaining the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nachhaltige Entwicklung combines education and fun. The game is about sustainable development (that's what the title translates to) in germany. Players act as newsmakers trying to compete for the most important topics to put in their papers.<br/><br/>Step 1:<br/>At the beginning of each round there are two of the two-faced news cards on the table, showing a little headline or news story on the upside, and one of seven colors (political topics) and some symbols unseen on the backside (like social security, health, mobility, education, environment, etc.). Players can acquire those cards by blind bidding of reporter cards. They must try to match their reporter cards to the topic of the news item by assessing which political topic this story is about.<br/><br/>Step 2: reporter and news cards are flipped. Players can only get those cards that they have matched the symbols of. The player with the most stars gets the card. Then, every player gets their reporter cards back, regardless of success in the auction.<br/><br/>Step 3: Players can swap news and reporter cards with each other if they like.<br/><br/>Step 4: Writing an article - scoring points. This is the only phase with a set player order. The first player chooses two or more news cards of the same color (i.e. topic), then draws an event card from the event deck and reads out the instructions that fit the color of the cards chosen. He then scores points based on the event card, symbols on the news cards, and some bonus points about number of news cards or combinations of symbols. He also gets an additional reporter card.<br/><br/>The game ends after a set number of rounds or time, so it can be easily fit into a school lesson.<br/><br/>This game is a reimplementation of a Swiss game called Klartext.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This undated game combines die rolling with memory. Each player takes a bingo-like card with four numbered columns and seven rows of circles and covers each circle with a plastic disk (plack). On each card, 12 circles are blank, and the remainder have instructions such as &quot;Pick-A-Plack&quot;; &quot;Others cover one blank&quot;, &quot;Have another turn&quot; or &quot;Cover two blanks&quot;.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling a die. On a 1-4, they may remove one plack from that column; on a 5, they must replace a plack on an open location of their choice; and on a 6, they may remove a plack from any one location. When removing a plack, they obey whatever instructions are underneath. The player who first removes all the placks on his card wins.<br/><br/>Despite the random element of die rolling, the key to victory is using required replacement of placks to re-cover useful spots, and remembering which of these will be most useful in each future situation.<br/><br/>",

Two 10&quot; wooden poles are inserted in two other wooden blocks fixed to the box near the back, and have a string running between them.

Any number of rounds may be played, with the player having the biggest bag winning.<br/><br/>The instructions inside the box lid show that three other versions of the game were produced: the smallest with just a cardboard backdrop, a larger square version with four poles and strings, and a huge octagonal version with eight poles in two squares at different heights, shown with 21 birds perches and more fallen.<br/><br/>",

It is a game for 2-6 players, who roll dice to move around the board while building up a full four-stage Saturn rocket and then successfully launching it.<br/><br/>Components include the board, 36 Astronaut (or &quot;Condition&quot;) playing cards with period photographs, 20 yellow Chance cards, 8 green Espionage cards, 12 pink Sabotage cards, 4 plastic rockets, each in four stages, 6 wooden rocket playing pieces, money in &quot;mios&quot; or $millions, and 36 markers.<br/><br/>To do so, players must land on squares allowing them to collect research grants, buy rocket parts or &quot;Condition&quot; cards that fill in each player's Control Board, and collect Chance, Espionage or Sabotage cards to help their own projects or hurt their opponents. There is even a funny &quot;Astronaut Training&quot; space where players must get up and do 10 knee bends or pay 100 mio for being out of condition. Players may trade cards or parts by moving into another player's home area.<br/><br/>Once all four stages are ready and the Control Board is full, a player may attempt a final Count Down. He must roll 2D6 three times, and if he gets a cumulative total of 25 or more, he wins the game. He may roll again on succeeding turns unless of course his project is sabotaged.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the designer:<br/><br/>This is a new semi-cooperative card game of political negotiation, deception and voting in which players are politicians from the two big parties but who also try to push forward an individual hidden agenda. This game was initially designed as a game-base learning tool at the London School of Economics and Political Science to introduce students to collective decision-making, game theory and market regulation. The game scales well at different player counts and plays under 1 hour. Gamers and non-gamers alike will enjoy Kill the Bill. It rewards experienced players who manage well their hand of cards and use them in the appropriate way and at the right time. However, the game can be also thoroughly enjoyed as a party game with a strong take-that component in which negotiation and bluffing skills may compensate the lack of experience playing the tactics cards.<br/><br/>Overview<br/>In Kill the Bill, players are members of a high profile Committee in the U.S. Congress who try to pass legislation benefiting both their political party and their own secret individual agenda. Each year 3 bills are discussed and voted by the Committee. The goal of the game is to become the most popular politician by the end of the fourth year (round) so to become the front-runner in the next presidential campaign. <br/>Players obtain points by passing bills which are favorable to the interest of their party (party scoring track), or favorable to their individual agenda (agenda scoring track). Moreover players get (and lose) popularity points throughout the game as effect of the political tactics cards played. Skillful persuasion and negotiation are important to success. However, in politics things are never straightforward. A wide range of political tactics (cards) are available to players who can unexpectedly turn decisive votes in their favor. Building alliances across the party lines, having a long-term strategy in mind and showing tactical flexibility are important in &quot;Kill the Bill&quot; too. Players must be ready for blackmail, bribery, deception and treason. Sometimes the end justifies the means.<br/><br/>Turn order<br/>Each round consist of 4 phases:<br/>1-Preparation (new tactics cards are dealt -draft in the first year, Committee Chair is selected and bills presented)<br/>2-Logrolling (negotiation) phase: players try to persuade each other to support or oppose certain bills<br/>3-Political tactics phase: tactics cards are played<br/>4-Voting phase: bills are voted and scoring tracks adjusted.<br/><br/>",

The Presidential Campaign Game<br/>2nd Edition<br/>Overview:<br/>Citizens vote to elect our president. In this game, you can lead the campaign! ELECTION! is a game of trivia, teamwork, &amp; campaign strategy. Players compete to be the first party to claim the most electoral votes in an American Presidential election campaign. Players lead their party&rsquo;s campaign for president by raising funds and purchasing Town Hall, Advertise, and Charisma cards to earn votes. Then with votes in hand, they strategically claim State's electoral votes and ensure their party's victory. Game Play:<br/><br/>Each turn involves three actions.<br/>1 Roll dice<br/>2 Buy Cards<br/>3 Claim States<br/>ACTION 1: Players can choose to roll the dice to raise funds. ACTION 2: They can opt to buy cards to build their campaign and earn popular votes. For example, buy a Town Hall trivia card to test your knowledge of history, State Capitals, State nicknames, and more. A correct response earns the votes. ACTION 3: With popular votes in hand, the players use them to win selected States on the score ballot.<br/><br/>Players may also &quot;endorse&quot; a teammate after their three actions. This is done by forwarding cards to a teammate's hand, pooling cards and votes to claim more States during their turn. Can the party now claim enough electoral votes to win the election?<br/><br/>Game progress is kept on the score ballot. The score ballot lists all 50 states and DC, and is sorted based on presidential election results from 1988 through 2008. There are states that lean red, states that lean blue, and swing states in the middle. States that lean toward the player's political party require fewer popular votes to claim. The swing states are equal for each party, and are more difficult for both. By claiming states with earned votes, players win electoral votes for their party and work toward victory. The electoral votes listed are current for the 2012, 2016, and 2020 presidential elections.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1890 game from Milton Bradley uses the Happy Families/Authors mechanism of building sets by asking for cards, but complicates strategy through a set of bonus cards.<br/><br/>The game consists of 95 small card slips, roughly 2.5&quot; long by 0.5&quot; wide. Of these, 18 contain the name of a Longfellow poem, 72 have the name of the poem and two lines from it, and five contain the names of styles of edition bindings: Tree Calf; Full Morocco; Half Morocco; Cloth; and Paper. There also are six larger reference slips with the names of all 18 poems.<br/><br/>Players take turns asking for a poem or selections from a poem, and when they complete a set, play it down in front of them. They also may ask for an &quot;edition slip&quot;, and if the asked player has one, he must hand it over. If he has more than one, he chooses which to hand over.<br/><br/>All but the Paper slip provide a bonus that applies to all sets scored at the time it is played. Bonuses are cumulative, so a doubled pair plus two more sets then tripled equals 18 points. However, whichever player is left with the Paper slip at the end of the game cuts his total score in half. Highest net score wins.<br/><br/>The game is listed by Alex G. Malloy (American Games, 1999) at p. 34, #1033.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We Were Not Cowards: Sedan 1870 &amp; The Fall of the Second Empire is a grand tactical scale wargame by Ray Weiss covering the final desperate battle for Sedan in what amounted to Napoleon the III's last day in power.<br/><br/>The game uses Kevin Zucker's The Library of Napoleonic Battles series rules as a base and builds upon those to simulate the intricacies of military operations representing all levels of command and control. Units are at a brigade, division, squadron, or battery scale, with 1000 men per infantry Strength Point. Turns are approximately 1 hour each.<br/><br/>The game not only covers the somewhat hopeless historical battle, but also explores several &quot;What if?&quot; scenarios that explore what may have happened had Durcot retained command after MacMahon was wounded from Wimpiffen and ordered a retreat towards Paris. There are 2 other &quot;What If?&quot; scenarios that allow the french to respond to the Prussian encirclement which occurred a day before the actual battle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A 2-player abstract game, designed by C. W. Cowsley and distributed by Applied Technology in 1989. The game consists of twelve top-hat shaped tokens (10 yellow numbered from 1-10, 1 red and 1 blue), the instructions, and a green cloth bag which doubles up as a double-sided game board.<br/><br/>One player plays as Red, the other as Blue. The object of the game is to capture the highest total of numbered yellow tokens, without your own token being captured by your opponent. The tokens are designed so that they can be easily pressed together, so that the players' red and blue tokens gradually accumulate a stack of yellow tokens underneath them as the game progresses.<br/><br/>The board consists of ten circles, connected by lines in a geometric pattern. There are two variant configurations, one printed on each side of the cloth bag. The game is played in two phases: firstly, each player alternately places one numbered token on a circle until all ten have been placed; secondly players take turns moving their red or blue token along the lines from circle to circle, capturing tokens as they move, until either all ten numbered tokens have been captured - or one player has blundered allowing their own token to be captured! The advantage of going first is mitigated by placing an upper limit on the first token that the starting player may capture - in the basic game, this is fixed at 6; in the advanced game this is decided by auction.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game from Parker Brothers takes a concept used by early fishing games and re-themes it to divers trying to hook sunken treasure.<br/><br/>The game includes a fold-out cardboard &quot;tank&quot; about 9&quot; square and 6.5&quot; high. Each wall contains a mesh-covered arch through which players can see to some extent what they are doing. There are two foot-long wooden poles, each with a string dangling from one end leading to a 2.5&quot;-tall deep-sea diver figure with a small metal hook at its feet. The treasure consists of small cardboard rectangles, each with a metal loop projecting from the back, and the type of treasure (gold, silver, jewels) printed on the bottom with a value.<br/><br/>The treasures are placed value down at the bottom of the tank, and players must dangle their divers over the wall, twisting the rods to try and hook the treasures. The game can be played as a race between two people that lasts until all the treasure has been retrieved. Or it can be played by more people, with each player getting three minutes to hook as much as possible. Either way, the largest value of treasure (not number of catches) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game of global travel and trade. It consists of six miniature ships, two different spinners, and a four-section map of the world measuring roughly 35&quot; x 20&quot;. The map bears a variety of different routes available (Panama vs. Cape Horn, Suez vs. Cape of Good Hope, etc.) that can be sailed in either direction.<br/><br/>The objective is to complete a trip around the world while picking up the greatest value of cargo. Players each start with a ship in New York and spin for their initial cargo. They then announce a direction and destination, and when they arrive at that port, can add a cargo based on the chief exports of that port as listed on the board.<br/><br/>When leaving a port, players who spin greater than 3 move quickly but face a financial penalty (for being delayed in port). The winner is not the player who completes the round the world voyage first, but whoever finishes with the highest total value of cargo. If a ship is destroyed by landing on a storm, all cargo is lost, the player gets a spin for insurance to offset the lost, but starts again from New York.<br/><br/>",

This hasn&rsquo;t been done before and is an original feature of Farce.<br/><br/>Farce cards contain fragments of comedy which have been designed to combine with other fragments to generate new and original witty sentences. For each round of Farce each player combines up to 12 cards (comprised of the 3 elements) to make a witty sentence which they then read out to the group. Players use their own creativity to produce something uniquely funny with their cards which they then share with the group. The player who gets the most laughs wins the round.<br/><br/>The group decides on each round which player received the most laughs and awards a Farce Point. If there is any dispute then the dealer for that round has the final say. The dealer rotates after each round.<br/><br/>Farce includes 22 Wild Cards which allow players to insert the name of a fellow player into their farcical sentence, and thereby direct their sentences at each other and make fun of each other. This makes the game all about the players.<br/><br/>Farce is aimed at players aged 17+ as the outputs of the game can include adult humour.<br/><br/>The number of possible card permutations playable is virtually infinite. Players can always create something new with Farce, something original and funny which no one has ever heard before.<br/><br/>",

The deck has four suits (Star, Flag, Cross and Seal) each with cards numbered 1-15, along with a Koon card bearing the picture of a raccoon.<br/><br/>Players are dealt 10 cards each to start. On each turn, a player draws a card from the top of the remaining deck or of the discard pile, plays a set or more if he wishes, and discards a card. As in rummy, sets can be three or more of a kind or three or more of a suit in sequence.<br/><br/>However, in addition to laying down sets of their own, players may add cards to any set or sequence of any player on the board. The Koon card is wild and may be used in any set, but if it is played on the end of a sequence, the player holding that actual card may play it, and add the Koon to the other end of the sequence.<br/><br/>The object is to be the first player to empty his hand. The last card in a hand may be discarded or may be used in a set, with no discard. Other players add up the value of cards remaining in their hand and score that many points. Game winner is the one with the fewest points at the end of the agreed number of hands.<br/><br/>",

The center of the board shows the Wandering Jew arriving in Paris, and also includes the rules.<br/><br/>As in Game of Goose, players make an initial ante, and may be forced to pay more into the pot as a result of landing on certain squares.

Your task is to complete quests in order to build up your character by finding new loot, learning new skills, and defeating nasty foes. Doing this will allow you to embark on even tougher quests.<br/><br/>You will start your adventure in UnderQuest at the Lonely Troll Inn, where you will create a new character by picking a race and class, each with different skills and perks. You will then equip your adventurer with trapping and you may also hire a torch-bearer to help you on your mission. You then must choose a quest and travel to that location to begin. UnderQuest uses a unique draw three, pick one mechanic while you are exploring the huge underground world, along with a tactical dice system for combat. Each enemy feels quite different. You will find powerful weapons, armor, and items along the way to aid you in your quest. There is even a clever alchemy system that allows you to craft potions.<br/><br/>During your adventure you will encounter not just foes, but also treasure, campsites, traps, random encounters, and quest points. When you have to resolve a random encounter, you will get to read from over 50 random encounters in the random encounter book. These can range from strange caravans and wandering merchants to poisonous mushroom groves and snake pits! Whenever you trigger a quest point, you will read the next entry in the quest log. This allows UnderQuest to have a strong narrative to drive the storytelling aspect of the game and make each quest feel fleshed out.<br/><br/>Will you be able to build a lowly adventure into a mighty hero, or will your adventurer fall to the darkness that sleeps below. You can only find out by taking on the UnderQuest!<br/><br/>",

In this case, the captain may not go down with the ship, but you can bet everyone else will!<br/><br/>Mutiny was introduced in concept during the 2014 rpggeek.com VirtuaCon digital convention event. At that time it was called &quot;Pirates of the Sinking Ship&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules for Mutiny are simple: Using five, or perhaps six, standard dice, players roll for values of 3-5, hoping to amass wealth, 6's to board the lifeboat on which the gold is stored, while attempting to avoid 1's and 2's, which sink the ship.<br/><br/>When the ship reaches a water level of 20 fathoms, the ship sinks, with all aboard except whichever clever pirate has snuck aboard the lifeboat and made away with the treasure.<br/><br/>This game also includes Rum cards, which can be spent to gain initiative to roll dice. However, when a player's number is rolled, his rum card must be spent. Therefore, all players will receive an opportunity to roll the dice (and hopefully board the lifeboat) at least once.<br/><br/>Mutiny is played over a course of 3 separate games. Player character abilities shift each game, and are related to numbers also used to initiate a player's turn.<br/><br/>1) When this player is aboard the lifeboat, 1's rolled increase the water level by 2 fathoms.<br/><br/>2) This player may reroll any 2's rolled during his turn.<br/><br/>3) This player may keep his Rum card until he chooses to spend it to take his turn.<br/><br/>4) This player adds 2 gold to the lifeboat whenever he rolls a 4.<br/><br/>5) This player acquires 1 gold for his own personal pocket whenever anyone rolls his number during turn initiation. (The gold is added to his score at game end, provided he has won at least one of the three games.)<br/><br/>6) This player rolls six dice, instead of 5.<br/><br/>May the best backstabbing mutineer win!<br/><br/>",

You must manage your Minions - the Pirates, Ninjas, and Robots that do your bidding, play actions that can improve your situation or wreak havoc with your enemies, and use your Minions to launch attacks and hope that your rivals can&rsquo;t turn the cascade of results to their own advantage.<br/><br/>Each player has a set of Minion cards that they can use to attack other players, and a set of Action cards in their hand that they can use to affect either their own minions, or other player's minions. The objective of the game is to use your Minions and Actions to attack the other players and reduce their health until only a single player remains.<br/><br/>A Minion attacks by triggering another active Minion on the board. When a Minion is triggered it has an effect - it can deal damage to players, it can heal a player, or it can add flip counters to another Minion. But be careful! Attacking a Minion can cause a chain reaction that is out of your control. Each Minion has 2 different effects on either side of its card - each time it triggers it has a different effect on the game, and then it flips to reveal the opposite side. Minions also have a limited number of flips, once they're spent they are removed from play.<br/><br/>Can you out-think your opponents? Can you take advantage of the Minions on the board in order to come out on top? Eliminate your rivals and seize control of the city. Or at the very least, take all your rivals out with you and have the strongest army of Minions left who can secure the city for your successor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A strategic faction based die stacking and siege game. Take control of an elemental faction waging war over ancient ruins. Earn points by rebuilding ruins as high as you can; however, be wary of your adversaries who will try and knock them down with their siege engines.  As seen at PAX West 2016 in the Indie Megabooth.<br/><br/>Each turn players perform an action to explore new territory, move or fire their siege engine, or take control of territory with their leader. Then they roll dice to build up the ancient ruins on the board. The taller a ruin is, the more points it is worth but the bigger target it is to be knocked down by an enemy siege engine. Dice knocked out of play are captured and worth points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, whoever has the most points currently on the board wins. There are five different scoring objectives (ruin height, color matching, captured enemy dice, faction objectives, and your faction leader's control) which can all contribute to your victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Halfling Harvest is a simple take-that set collecting came for two to four players.<br/><br/>Every year our Halfling friends have a little party to celebrate the end of their harvest. The last few years have been quite extravagant and the problem is, this year they have drawn the attention of the various monsters that live in the mountains around the shire with their little shin-dig.<br/><br/>As the Halflings drink and dance on into the night, these monsters arrive all at the same time and (as one would expect) they do not wish to share the spoils. The fight amongst them grew ugly fast and I fear that our friends will all be hauled off one by one in the impending battle.<br/><br/>What we need is a distraction. The sun will rise soon and the monsters will scatter, so why don't we trick them into having a contest for the Halflings. Have each group take a recipe and the first to gather all their ingredients, gets ALL the Halflings. With a little luck this will delay them long enough that the sun will come up and our little friends can make it home in one piece.<br/> Goal of the game/objective<br/><br/>Players take on the persona of one of four monsters and scramble to sort through the pile of ingredients to gather what they need to complete their recipe. This is done by drawing from the pile and playing cards from your hand; laying them face up on the table in front of you. The first person to collect and play all the items in their recipe wins. Play again to delay as long as possible!<br/><br/>At the end, the winner of the most games can decide whether they are a friend of the Halflings in disguise and was able to delay long enough to set them free, or is the real Monster and EATS THEM...<br/><br/>Component list<br/><br/>&bull;72 Poker sized cards, 12 Jumbo sized recipe cards, and a Rules sheet in a two piece box<br/>&bull;4- player cards: Ogres, Giants, Goblins, Trolls<br/>&bull;12- recipe cards and 68- component cards  <br/>&bull;13- Halflings  <br/>&bull;42- Ingredient cards:<br/>&bull;7 each of: Spice, Dragonberry, Mutton, Fungus, Dwarfish Eel, &amp; Elf Bread <br/>&bull;9- Attack Cards:<br/>&bull;1 Take Two Halflings, 1 Take Two Ingredients, 1 Wild Attack, 3 Take One Halfling, 3 Take One Ingredients <br/>&bull;2- Wild Ingredient Cards <br/>&bull;2- Defend Cards<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>1.At the start of each turn, if the player has any number of Halflings, they MUST play all into their recipe by laying them face up in front of them.  <br/>2.Next, the player may play any one ingredient card into their recipe if desired, by placing it face up next to the Halflings in front of them. <br/>3. If the player has an attack card, they may then choose to play one against another player. *note: stolen items may not be put in your hand, but must be played immediately.* <br/>4.After the attack, the player may discard any number of cards still left in their hand into the discard pile.    <br/>5.The player will then draw from the component deck into their hand back up to a limit of five cards.<br/>6.Play continues to the left.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>-Stolen items must be played directly into the recipe<br/>-&ldquo;Wild&rdquo; cards can be played in place of any ingredients, but not Halflings<br/>-The &ldquo;Wild Attack&rdquo; card can steal any card, Ingredient or Halfling, and is the only card that can steal a &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; card. <br/>-The &ldquo;Take two Halfling&rdquo; and &ldquo;Take two Ingredients&rdquo; attack cards may both be taken from the same player, OR may take one from two different players.  <br/>-You may play more ingredients or Halflings into your recipe then are required.<br/><br/>",

First player who reaches 200 metres wins.<br/><br/>BOX CONTENTS<br/>98 playing cards and 2 more cards with the rules.<br/><br/>CONTENTS TO PLAY<br/>Cards, six-sided dice (take one of any other game or download an application on your smartphone browser that simulates one), notebook and pencil.<br/><br/>PREPARATION<br/>The game can be played by any number of players from 2 to 6.<br/>Write down in your notebook each one of the players in order to add the metres reached.<br/>Divide the cards into three stacks:<br/>1. Race (map-greens)<br/>Overcome obstacles, dodge monsters and answer the wise men&rsquo;s questions correctly to get metres in the race.<br/>2. Equipment (open coffer-purples)<br/>There are two kinds of objects:<br/>Those ones that help to overcome obstacles (blues).<br/>Those ones that are used for hindering the rest of runners (reds).<br/>3. Runners (cup-yellows)<br/>Each one of the runners has a physical skill (frog jump, lion strength, rabbit speed) that helps against monsters. There is also an intellectual one (language or mathematics) that helps to answer the wise men&rsquo;s questions.<br/><br/>CARD MANAGEMENT<br/>Shuffle the three stacks separately.<br/>Each player chooses a runner that is put face up on the table. The discarded cards are kept.<br/>Deal four equipment cards to each player. It is necessary to keep them out of sight. You can never have more than four equipment cards in your hand. The unused cards are put face down at one side of the table.<br/>The race stack is put face down in the middle of the table. The race starts when putting face up the first card of the stack. When the stack has no cards left, shuffle and put face down again.<br/><br/>BEGINNING OF THE GAME<br/>Roll the dice and the player with the highest score, starts playing. Each turn spins in a clockwise direction and starts showing a card of the race stack. Each card has a challenge with a score that must be overcome by rolling the dice. If you get it you get more metres or more equipment. If not, it is likely to lose metres (never under zero), equipment or the position. Each turn does not finish until each and everyone of the players try to overcome it.<br/><br/>STAGES IN EACH TURN<br/>Each turn is divided into two stages:<br/>1. Use of the equipment. You can use equipment cards only once.<br/>2. Overcoming the challenge. In order to get it you will have to roll the dice and overcome the score of each challenge. It will be kept in mind if some equipment card has been used.<br/>(Before starting each player&rsquo;s turn, it will be also kept in mind if some equipment card has been used for hindering).<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>The player who reaches 200 metres wins Villa Musara&ntilde;as Great Race Cup.<br/><br/>",

There is a spring-loaded 4&quot; wooden bat that the batting player holds back and releases to strike the ball. There is a small bell behind home plate labeled &quot;Automatic Umpire&quot;: if the batter does not swing, a pitch hitting the bell is a strike, while one missing it is a ball.<br/><br/>While the game is undated, the box is labeled &quot;A Lynn Pressman Original&quot;, suggesting that it was published after her husband Jack Pressman's death in 1959.<br/><br/>",

The deck has 40 cards, each with the name and large ink drawing of an animal on top, and four small drawings and animal names underneath, forming sets of five cards to be collected. Each card also bears a number from 1 to 8 to identify the set. This is intended to allow children to call for cards even if they don't yet read well.<br/><br/>The game uses a &quot;go-fish&quot; mechanism, with five cards initially dealt to each player. Players ask for another animal from another player, get another turn if they are successful, and draw from the top of the deck if they are not. Player collecting the most sets wins.<br/><br/>The cover of the box notes the patent registration date of Aug. 23rd, 1887 and displays the price of 25 cents. The side of the box declares: &quot;Natural History Made Easy and Amusing: Fun, Wit and Knowledge combined.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nodes is a strategy game for two or four players. The game board is octagonal, and each space is the intersection of a horizontal, vertical, and two diagonal lines. There are thus eight lines emanating out from each space in the manner of a compass rose.<br/><br/>There are two types of pieces: nodes and units. Nodes are akin to the king in Chess. They only can move one space, and a player wins when they surround their opponent's node. Units are akin to pawns in chess. They are the main troops in the game and form the basis of each player's strategy. Each player has one node and eight units throughout the game.<br/><br/>Unlike chess, however, the placement of the nodes on the board also determines how the units can move. The lines that extend in eight directions from the space a node occupies are called &quot;lines of communication.&quot; If a unit is located along a line of communication the unit can move, whether it's the player's node or their opponent's. If the unit moves into a space that is also along the same line as a node, it can move again. But if a unit moves out of line or starts a turn out of line, it can't move.<br/><br/>A player's turn involves moving as many pieces as they want as many spaces as they want in order to defend their own node and attack their opponent's node. Every turn asks the players to make strategic decisions about when to attack, when to defend, and how to do both with only eight units. At the end of a player's turn, they move their node, and the other player makes their move. The game ends when one player is unable to move their node.<br/><br/>",

The game ends when the great storm comes and floods the unprotected districts. Players earn points for successfully fulfilling the their secret goals, and lose points for failure.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a set collection game using a deck of cards with historical figures who played important roles in the Bakumatsu period (1853-1867) on them (these cards also serve as a standard deck of cards). Each player is dealt five cards. On their turn, the player draws one card and discards one card face up in front of them, trying to build one of 43 sets, which are thematic (people from the same domain, people involved in the same incidents, etc.), require 2 to 5 cards, and are rated from one to fifty points. When a player is one card away from completing his or her set, they say &quot;Iza! Jinjo ni!&quot; (Roughly, &quot;Let's fight properly), and discard their card sideways. If they see the last card they need in front of another player, they may take it and finish their set. When a player finishes their set, they say &quot;Bakumatsu,&quot; and discard their last card. They are done. The game ends when the deck runs out, at which time the sets are scored, highest score wins and deals the next game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This might be described as a minimalist baseball game. It consists of a single plastic-laminated sheet which includes a small baseball diamond, a scoring box, rules of play, and a remarkably detailed results table that aims to reflect the probabilities of a wide range of plays.<br/><br/>The playing mechanism is a regular pack of cards, and each batting player turns over cards and records the outcomes until reaching three outs for an inning.<br/><br/>The table shows a specific result for each card in the deck, including contingencies such as tagging up on a fly out. The 52 cards produce 7 singles, 2.6 doubles, 1 triple and 1.4 home runs (7 of hearts = HR in innings 3, 6, 7 and 9, otherwise a double). There are 3 walks and 2 errors, while the rest are outs of various kinds.<br/><br/>The special situations apply to the three double play cards along with the 7 of spades and 3 of diamonds, where the outcomes vary depending on combinations of runners on base.<br/><br/>",

The pot is filled with the beans and placed on top of the post, which is inserted in a hole at the front of the target area.<br/><br/>The rules say players should shoot from a distance of 8-10 feet, and get three shots each. When they hit the pot, it spills the beans onto the target area. Any that fall into holes count that many points. Any that remain loose are replaced in the pot for the next shot.<br/><br/>Winner is the first player to accumulate 250 points.

        "description": "This is a Monopoly-style election game with some add-on trivia. Each player starts with $5.5 million and rolls dice to move around the 62-space track. A player landing on a state space may pay $20,000 times its electoral votes to win it. If he doesn't want to or can't pay, the state goes up for auction. And if the state is already owned, the player pays $10,000 times electoral votes into the Campaign Fund Treasure Chest. Any player landing on that space collects all money there.<br/><br/>There are three kinds of random event cards and spaces: National Election Commission, National Party Headquarters and Press Conference. Each may grant or cost money or votes, and may offer the opportunity to answer a trivia question from a Presidential Seal card. Each card has two questions, one of which is chosen and read by an opponent. Answering correctly provides benefits.<br/><br/>The first candidate to 270 electoral votes wins, but a player may win sooner if all opponents go broke. There is a time-limit elimination process for more than two players. After 60 minutes, there is a ballot, and the player with the lowest EV total drops out and returns his states to the banks. Further ballots are held each 15 minutes until the game is down to 2 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "French cycling game with a disctintive 1970s flavour.<br/><br/>As is typical in this kind of games, it combines overambitious features with rules that are  quite obvious in general, though they may feature some surprises.<br/><br/>This game is big (the box measures 65 x 28 cms) and heavy, specially due to the seven (!) boards included. Five of these boards are just different finishes for various stages. Another board (&quot;parcour montagne&quot;) can be either the end of a stage or a stage in itself, while the bigger board &quot;(&quot;parcours plaine&quot;) is the one used in mosts races.<br/><br/>A maximum of six players manages a team of two riders each.<br/><br/>The riders are seventies' Cofalus (5cms, smaller than the ones featured in later games like l'Echapp&eacute;e Infernale or Les G&eacute;ants de la Route), and two extra riders are provided for the yellow and green jerseys. <br/>The riders are a bit oversized for the board (which is nevertheless quite big), and there is also a trailing car (voiture balai).<br/><br/>Most of the time you throw two dice and move your two riders. You decide which rider you move with each dice, considering that you are not allowed to move to a field occupied by another rider, and that there are certain fields that give you advantages or disadvantages.<br/><br/>An interesting/unusual rule, though, is the one for the trailing car. It starts its movement when the first rider reachs km. 47, and stops at km 100 of flat stages. If there are two or three players in the game, the trailing car moves 5 fields forward in each movement. For 4 or 5 players it just moves 4 field. With 6 players, it just moves 3 fields. All the riders caught up by the car are out of the race, though they may take part in subsequent stages.<br/><br/>For mountain stages, movement rules change. Before a climb, riders have tos stop compulsorily in the &quot;Plateforme&quot; field before the climb (in which there can be no more than three riders at a time). Then, during climbs, to progress to the next field riders must throw exactly the number inscribed in that field. If the field ahead is blocked by another rider, you must throw the number corresponding to the first free field, to which you will move. As a result, riders tend to form pelotons in the climbs, and these pelotons disband quickly in the descents.<br/><br/>By the way, there is no trailing car in mountain stages.<br/><br/>Another unusual feature of this game are the different stage finishes. Riders have to arrive to the neutral zone (last field) and then they move onto that particular stage finishing board. What is most unusual is that every finish has different rules. For instance, in end of stage G you have game-of-goose rules, while in end of stage F you move forward with even numbers but backward with odd numbers. In the velodrome, you have to fall exactly on the finishing stage or else ride another lap. A flat stage can end with a climb, using the B' part of board B.<br/><br/>At the end of the game (the players can decide how many of the stages they want to play) the player who's riders score best in the general classification wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game made by Marco Rossi, from Genoa (Italy). It is a clever middle point between a simulation replay game and a board game. You can play it by yourself, with a lot of tables, individual characteristics for each rider and a some of dice-throwing and table checking like a replay game, but you still have a board and riders, and the game can be played by several players.<br/><br/>There are (or maybe I should say &quot;there wiill be&quot;) six versions of the game, corresponding to six historical periods  (one for each post WWII decade: mine is the 1966-1975 edition). There are ten teams for each historical period, plus a bonus &quot;world championship&quot; special set.<br/><br/>There are ten team (of three riders which you can chose among four fdifferent ones). That makes thirty riders, and they all take part in the race, regardless of whether there are enough players. In the (most probable) case of having less than ten players, there are rules to manage the virtual players, to take decisions for them as whern to attack and when to follow other riders, etc...<br/><br/>You can play the game by yourself against nine virtual teams, in which case the game is almost a replay game (thouigh you still take your decisions for one of the teams). I wonder which would be the better balance between the number of human players and the number of virtual teams for the game playability.<br/><br/>An individual race or stage consists of six game turns. The winner is not the first to reach a certain point in the board, but the one to ride further in these six turns.<br/><br/>Before the race you set up six tiles in a special window in the board , which will define the race profile. (In the case of the picture below, a mountain stage, though one starting with a &quot;pav&eacute;s&quot; zone). You can design your own race profile, but you can also use one of the many included in the game rules. You can chose between Milano-San Remo,  Gand-Velvegem, Fl&egrave;che Wallonne, Gold Race, Paris-Tours, Ronde van Vlaanderen, Paris-Roubaix, Liege-Bastogne-Liege, Paris-Bruxelles, Giro di Lombard&iacute;a, a World Championship, a Time Trial World Championship, as well as 10-stage long Giro d'Italia and Tour de France.<br/><br/>",

The riders are numbered from 1 to 5 in each team, and  the winner is the first team with three riders crossing the finish line. <br/>On their turn players throw the die five times and the first throw is for rider number 1, the second for number 2, and so on...<br/><br/>However, at any time a player can decide to move the team's car instead of the designated rider.<br/><br/>There are also positive squares, marked AV (for &quot;AVituallamiento&quot;, that is, feeding zone). Riders falling on them have an extra throw.<br/><br/>There is also an intermediate sprint (&quot;Meta Volante&quot;) which also gives an extra throw to all the riders who pass it (regardless of whether they fall on it). If the result of this extra throw makes the rider fall on a C or P square, the throw is not valid and the rider may repeat the throw.<br/> After square 35 there is a parking place for the cars, which cannot help riders in the final part of the race even though there is a square marked P and one marked with a C.<br/><br/>The game also provides classification sheets in case you want to play a stage race. <br/>All the stages are similar and the classification is a points classification, with 40 awarded to the winner of the stage, 36 points to the second and one point to the 25th rider.<br/><br/>",

The companies, along with their associates the Joint Steamer Companies, were involved in the transportation of goods throughout India (and, post partition, Pakistan). The game is a simulation of this regional logistic operation, featuring elements of roll-and-move with some mitigating choices, pick up and deliver, and the acquisition of routes and ports.<br/><br/>In the game up to 6 players each have a steamer and a train which they can move along the waterways and railways of North East India and East Pakistan (beginning in Calcutta), with movements based on dice rolls. At each port or rail depot they can collect cargo or deliver cargo. Cargo items are unique and are to be delivered to specific destinations, with varying payments on delivery. At certain points players collect &quot;report&quot; cards, which function similarly to &quot;chance&quot; cards in Monopoly, bestowing small benefits or losses on the player.

        "description": "This is a card game based on the stress of living in the Big Apple. There is a deck of 98 cards. Of these, 19 are I Survived New York! cards, which when played in front of a player, open that player to getting stressed out. There are 34 Stress Cards, of five types: Romance, Bucks, Shelter, Nine to Five, and Why Me? There are 38 Relief cards, each of which stops a specific type of stress. There are 5 Quick Fix cards, one for each kind of stress, that both provide relief and prevent that player from receiving any more stress of that kind for the rest of the round. Finally, there are 2 Reversal cards, which of course allow a player to dump his current stress on another player.<br/><br/>Players receive 5 cards each to start, and each turn draw one card and either play or discard one card. They may play their cards on any player including themselves. An I Survived New York card opens a player to receiving stress, one card at a time. A Relief card &quot;closes&quot; a stress pile, at which point that player then adds up his accumulated stress cards and notes the total on a scorepad. All the cards in the closed pile go into the discard pile, and that player is now free of additional stress until someone opens a new stress pile with an ILNY card.<br/><br/>As soon as one player has reached 4,000 stress points and closed his current pile, the round ends, and all cards are returned and reshuffled. When a player accumulates more than 12,000 stress points, he burns out totally and must move to Cleveland. The last survivor wins the game, unless a player accumulates exactly 12,000 points, at which point he wins instantly and becomes Mayor of New York.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an asymmetrical abstract game of movement. The game board is a grid of squares six deep by four wide, with the four squares in the upper left excluded and replaced by the game label. The result is two columns of four squares and two of six squares, with stars at each corner numbered from 1 to 31.<br/><br/>The stars are connected by pathways orthogonally and along alternating diagonals, so a given star may have as few as three connections on an edge and eight in the middle of the board.<br/><br/>One player takes the Chuco, a single large black plastic figure, and the other player takes 12 smaller blue hunters. Pieces may move one space along any path to an empty star, but the Chuco can jump an adjacent hunter if there is an open space behind it.<br/><br/>The Chuco moves first, starting on star #13, third rank in the middle. The hunters start across the first two ranks and on the two edge stars on the third rank. The hunters win if they can immobilize the Chuco by surrounding it on star 27. Since doing so requires all 12 hunters, the Chuco player wins by jumping a single hunter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This undated baseball game from Fairchild seems have evolved from the company's 1946 Baseball game. This game consists of two separate decks of cards: one of 28 Pitching cards and the other of 30 Hitting/Fielding cards. Also included are a small glossy baseball diamond and scoring box, erasable crayons for marking the score and wooden discs for baserunners.<br/><br/>To play, the Pitching cards are shuffled and placed face down between the players. The Hitting/Fielding cards are shuffled, and each player is dealt a hand of five. The batting player must discard and replace any Pickoff card, while the fielding player must discard and replace any Error card.<br/><br/>For each turn, the fielding player turns over the top Pitching card, which shows either a Ball, a green Fastball, blue Curve, yellow Changeup or a red Slider. The Batting player draws a card from Hitting/Fielding deck and then must try to play a card that matches the color of the pitch. Each of these cards has a number from 1 to 4. The fielding player then draws a card from the Hitting/Fielding deck and tries to match the color of the hitting card. A color match with a number equal to or higher than the batting card is an out; if the fielding card is lower, the difference is the number of bases hit/advanced. A card that doesn't match in color counts as a zero.<br/><br/>The batting player may use an Error card to automatically advance the batter and all runners by one base. The fielding player may use a Pick Off card to remove a runner on base. A fielding card 2 higher than the batting card is a double play if a runner is on first; 3 higher allows a double play of any two runners.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Election Frenzy is a new card game, based on the wild world of Presidential politics. Win the game by collecting endorsements, popularity, and media points. Attack your opponents with attack ads and scandals. Manage your campaign funds and win the Presidency!<br/><br/>In Election Frenzy, there are 3 rounds, and each round is split into two phases.<br/><br/>In Phase 1, the Campaign phase, players try to build the strongest hand possible, by collecting cards in the Popularity, Endorsements, and Media categories (suits); similar to poker, Uno, and Sushi-Go.<br/><br/>In Phase 2, the Attack phase, players use attacking cards to either burn or steal desired cards from their opponents; similar to Go Fish, and Bang!<br/><br/>The winner of each suit receives 2 electoral points, while the runner up receives 1. (Example: 1st place in Popularity = 2 pts. 2nd place in Endorsements = 1 pt. 3rd place in Media = 0 pts. TOTAL = 3 pts)<br/><br/>After 3 rounds, the player with the most electoral points is the President!<br/><br/>There are some really fun nuances to the game. Each character has strengths and weaknesses, based on the real life politicians who are being parodied. For example, Hillary has a bonus each round for the Endorsements, while Donald has a bonus each round for Media.<br/><br/>Each character also starts the game with a fixed amount of money. Money is needed to launch attacks. There is also money scattered throughout the deck, so even if you spend all of your cash, there is still a chance to replenish your funds by drawing the right cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an undated promotional game by packaged food giant ConAgra that pushed three of its brands. The game comes in a 9.5&quot; x 14&quot; envelope, and consists of a rules sheet and two folded and perforated sheets of glossy cardboard.<br/><br/>One sheet is made up of the playing field, stadium and 8 player cards, while the other has 18 player cards, 16 fly ball result cards, 16 ground ball result cards, 16 batter and runner figures, two dice (one red and one blue), and assorted signs and markers. The baseball stadium, scoreboards and the dice need to be assembled after separating the pieces.<br/><br/>Players draft their teams from the pool of 9 red and 9 blue players. The red players are long ball hitters and use the red die; the blue players hit more ground balls and use the blue die.<br/><br/>For each at-bat, the batting player rolls the appropriate die, which produces ball, strike, foul, fly ball or ground ball. When the ball is hit, players take one of the fly ball or ground ball cards and follow the results, which range from home runs to double plays. The usual rules of baseball apply.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Grand Dean of an ancient, abandoned Victorian Theatre has a brilliant idea to rebuild it back to its former glory. Discovering that ragtag teams of utterly horrible musicians have been sneaking in and using the theatre for practice sessions, he decides to put every last remaining bit of his fortune into organising a tournament and invites these completely untalented teams to participate. They would be challenged to perform various musical scores in an extremely short amount of time. This is deliberate just so the true talents will be quickly picked out from the rest. The winning group shall hence be personally groomed by the Grand Dean himself into a world class orchestra team, where they would properly represent the currently dysfunct Theatre and make it famous again!<br/><br/>You are ringleaders of your own groups of musicians, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to become famous. Starting from a skeleton crew of horrendous talents, you will grow in strength and ultimately evolve into a mighty orchestra fit for any world stage.<br/><br/>Cantabile Blitz is played in Stages, which are then broken down into Performances. Every player starts off with the same set of basic dice, each die representing a musician of one type of instrument. At the end of every performance, the Grand Dean will reward better performing groups with more cash, which in turn allows them to recruit better and more musicians into their team. This is represented by more types of dice, eventually reaching a fully fleshed out orchestra. There are no turns in this game, and the actual musical performances are in real time. As soon as a musical score even remotely resembles its original tune by any of the groups' plays, the group can quickly submit their recording to the Grand Dean. However, the group that submits the score and ends that performance does not necessarily always win that round. They do have bonus points for doing so, but other bands might have raked up more points by completing more segments in the music sheet!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As a druid, players must restore Purity back into the Drachnel Forest by casting Enchantments throughout various glades. There are 8 rounds in the game also known as Sabbats from the Celtic Wheel of the Year. During a turn a Druid must build a glade of the forest and then perform actions by himself or with the help of a summoned animal. Druids must try to Enchant a Glade to earn Spirit points. Glades that have less purity than others will earn more Spirit points. Each druid that creates a Triad (3 adjacent glades with their own enchantment) will score Spirit Points. Depending on the position of The Wheel of the Year, glade enchanting may prove difficult. Certain glades are also abundant with Druidic Magick; swiping other&rsquo;s enchantments, using magical bursts, or summoning forest animals for assistance, to name a few. The more the game is played, players will come up with new strategies and new ideas on how to best earn Spirit. Each game will create a random layout of the forest, never knowing which glades will be present that game. And you never know what changing events the Drachnel Forest will unleash - so be certain to store up your Mind Power to use only when needed. The druid with the most Spirit Points after one year, wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This undated but likely mid-20th century title has an unusual mechanism based on two midway-style spinning wheels, one red for pitching and the other green for batting.<br/><br/>Each wheel has four large fins in the middle that players use to spin the wheel, vertical teeth on the rim between each of the 40 wheel segments, and a flexible metal strip mounted to a post on the corner that slows the wheel and eventually comes to rest between two of the pegs. There is also a thick cardboard field and plastic pegs to mark runners, balls, strikes and outs.<br/><br/>The fielding player spins the pitching wheel, which includes 12 strikes, 13 balls, 6 fouls, 1 foul pop out, and 8 hits. Balls and strikes may lead to strike-outs or walks, but on any hit result, the batting player spins the red wheel. That wheel in turn has 12 ground outs, 14 fly outs, 8 singles, 3 doubles, 2 triples and 1 home run. Most results have specific consequences such as tagging up, advancing runners or double plays.<br/><br/>",

Two of the three panels form the game board, with a network of major and minor roads dotted with numbered obstacles and traffic signals. The third panel has the rules, the descriptions for the numbered spaces, six cut-out cars and three numbered tokens that are used instead of dice.<br/><br/>Players can choose whichever combination of routes they wish, but must respect the rules of the road - a rough road may be shorter, for instance, but require slower movement (two tokens instead of three).<br/><br/>The board has an artist's signature (Schreiner), but no date or indication of publisher. The physical format suggests that it might have been an insert in a magazine.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1960s title is a manual dexterity baseball game that can be played indoors or outdoors. The game consists of a thick cardboard baseball field with a base and support that enable it to be mounted vertically, as well as four 2&quot; concave plastic discs stamped to look like baseballs. The field has four holes that can be punched out: three semicircles in the outfields labelled 2 Base Hit, 3 Base Hit and Home Run, and one in the infield labelled Infield Out.<br/><br/>The field can be set up anywhere by placing the box lid upside down and mounting the field inside it. The players must agree on how far away the Battling Line should be. The rules suggest different distances depending on age and skill, from 20 feet for adults to less than 10 feet for younger than 9 years.<br/><br/>Each player in turn stands on the batting line and tosses the disks underhand at the field. Hitting the field on the fly between the foul lines is a single. Going through an outfield hole scores the labelled extra-base hit. Any disk that misses the target, hits the field after bouncing, or goes through the Infield Out hole is an Out. A player keeps batting until his third out, after which he scores the number of runs batted home that inning.<br/><br/>Each player (any number) takes one inning as batter and then the players repeat in sequence. The winner is the player with the most total runs after nine innings.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Despite being issued by the Electric Game Co., this game is made strictly of cardboard and wood and uses no power, probably because it was published in 1945 when wartime restrictions still reserved metal and batteries for military use.<br/><br/>The game has a wooden frame with the cardboard playing surface mounted at the bottom except for the 3&quot; nearest the players, where it tilts up to the top, forming a ramp. There is a football field across the far end, with peg holes each 10 yards into which is mounted a cardboard &quot;football&quot; wheel marked 0 to 10. This is placed and spun to show the current line of scrimmage (a 4 resting on the 20 yard line = 24).<br/><br/>There are five holes spaced around the board, each surrounded by results for 11 different plays. There also are small circles, each labelled with one of those plays (pass, punt, trick, end, lateral, field goal, etc.) and a yardage result. The offensive player calls the play and a wooden football player is placed on the corresponding circle on the field. The offensive player then spins a wooden top down the ramp.<br/><br/>If the top goes into a hole, the results are read from that hole. If the top hits the man, the result is the yardage in that circle. If it hits the man and goes into a hole, the hole result modifies the circle result. If it misses, it means no gain, missed pass or field goal, and a poor kickoff or punt. Play and scoring proceed according to normal football rules.<br/><br/>",

Face the hordes by yourself or with friends, as you seek to turn the Wheel of Fate in your favor!<br/><br/>Pocket Dungeon Adventures allows for up to 6 players to enjoy a light and fun dungeon exploration on the go! Choose from six different and unique classes, whilst battling against the enemy hordes! With each victory climb the ladders of fame and fortune!<br/><br/>In Army of Bone, players have lots of options with regards to gameplay and variety. They can opt to play solo, or choose from 2 to 6 player co-operative play. Then, players can choose to tackle either a single dungeon level (out of 3 varying difficulties), or face the entire dungeon as a 3 level campaign.<br/><br/>During the course of play, players will &quot;explore&quot; the dungeon level by flipping the dungeon cards, revealing items, traps and monsters. These will be acquired or defeated, gaining Gold for the players. Gold is used to purchase upgrades, to health, skills and weapons. Combat is resolved via dice rolling and use of skills.<br/><br/>When the Dungeon level is cleared, the Boss is challenged to gain access to the next level in campaign, or to gain victory, in single or final level play. After the campaign or level is defeated, all players win together in co-operative play. Note: if any player falls outside of a boss battle, the party automatically forfeits. In boss battles, fallen players are revived after it's defeat, to carry on to the next round.<br/><br/>Pocket Dungeon Adventures - Army of Bone is the first standalone game set in the Pocket Dungeon Adventures Universe (PDAU)!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monopologs  was developed  in the RAND Logistics Department. In it, a player or group of players  manages a simple simulation of the Air Force supply system consisting of one depot and five two-wing bases, which phase in during the game.  The players thus &quot;practice&quot; inventory management and gain insight into inventory-control problems.<br/><br/>The player acts as the inventory manager for  the &quot;Widget&quot; -- a high-value depot-reparable spare part -- and makes principal decisions of inventory control that such a manager has to make in reality.  Aware of the given costs and lead times for each of his actions, he initiates procurement, plans repair schedules, and sets inventory and distribution policies.<br/><br/>True to practical Air Force experience, the demand for the &quot;widget&quot; is a random variable beyond the player's control.  He is given certain limited information on the basis of which he must predict demands and establish inventory levels.  He makes decisions, and in time learns their consequences.  The game runs through a simulated period of 31 months, at the end of which he computes his score: the total costs his actions incurred.  Some of the scores of past groups are included for comparison.<br/><br/>Many different groups have found Monopologs highly educational.  The Air Force has found it useful for giving a broader management picture to many officers, particularly those concerned with only one phase of management, such as procurement or repair.  Aircraft contractors have used it to acquaint employees with their customers' problems.  At RAND itself, the game has helped to orient new employees and to stimulate logistics thinking.<br/><br/>",

It comes in a ziplock bag with a plasticized map of the United States, 4 crayons (red, yellow, green and blue), and a deck of 56 cards (50 state cards, a Washington D.C. card and five color-coded wild cards).<br/><br/>Players are dealt hands of five, and start by choosing one of their cards as their home state. Each player colors that state with his crayon. Each turn thereafter, a player starts by filling his hand to 5 cards either by drawing from the remaining deck or by stealing blind from another player.<br/><br/>To claim additional states, players must play cards for states that are adjacent to a state they already hold. In addition to playing from their hands, players may play the top card of the discard pile at any time. Players color in states as claimed, and only discard at the end of their turn if their hand still has five cards in it.<br/><br/>The states are color-coded by region, and there is one wild card for each region, plus a yellow wild card good for anywhere in the country. These allow players to claim non-adjacent states within the corresponding regions. Once all states have been claimed, the player with the largest number of electoral votes wins, with number of states held is a tie-breaker.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What Is Inside It is a full action packed, very thrilling &amp; very exciting card game. This game is of high intensity and mafia like situation. It is truly a Russian Roulette. It is highly enjoyable and can be played with a number of family members and friends. This is a great game if you are looking to have a great time. This is also a perfect party game as well as a source of great entertainment and joy. If you love Action, Thrill, Big Sum Of Money and Heavy Explosions then this game is a must for you.<br/><br/>Background Story &amp; Synopsis :<br/><br/>Imagine your self in a crisis situation and in an urgent need of cash. You end up getting in front of a loan shark who is also a crime boss, asking him for a million dollars. He places 3 briefcases in front of you and asks you to &quot;pick one and open it&quot;. He further mentions that &quot;only one of them has the million dollars in cash, one has the trash and one has the bomb. If you end up opening the case with the cash, you walk away rich, if you open the case with the trash, you walk away with nothing but the stink and if you open up the case with the bomb then you are a roasted meat&quot;. You take a good look at all the 3 briefcases, put in front of you to choose from. They all look exactly same, they all weigh exactly same, they also feel exactly same, but the only thing in which they differ is, what they carry inside. All the briefcases are completely odorless and produce no sound upon shaking them. They are completely sealed and locked. You may only choose one briefcase and you only get to know what is inside it, by opening it right there and right then. You finally choose and grab one briefcase to open it while wondering, what is inside it ...<br/><br/>GAME PLAY :<br/><br/>What is inside it is an exhilarating and an exciting game. A number of players can play it against each other. This game of odds, chances and strategy unfolds when a number of players are confronted with a number of cards with briefcases pictures on it. To open a briefcase, the playing card is flipped upside down so that the content of that briefcase is revealed. Without knowing what is inside of each card, the players pick up and flip one card at a time, upon their turn in each round. The risk element kicks in when all the players must instinctively choose and flip a number of cards, which are to be opened one at a time upon their turns, and the content of the card is revealed. As each card is flipped or turned, the likelihood of the players having a valuable cash amount such as a million dollars in the card or something else, such as a BOMB. The pressure mounts in each round, as the number of cards are turned or flipped. The players may also come under pressure by what might be contained in their chosen card. What is inside it ? cash or bomb or something else... The players will always be curious and puzzled, but they also know that as long as they do not intentionally or accidentally open the card with a BOMB or come under attack by any other opponent player, they are fine. There are multiple variants of this game, which can be played.<br/><br/>description from the publisher:<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hyakuninisshu English Translated Karuta is an English translated version of the Japanese original karuta using the translation of the Japanese old poems from the anthology called &quot;Hyakuninisshu&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is sometimes described as intellectual martial arts. It is about listening and being extremely focused and fast, just like the Samurai with their swords. Only here you fight with cards instead. The manga and anime and now a movie called &quot;Chihayafuru&quot; is about this game. For those who want to play like Chihaya and her friends but can not read Japanese, this is the game you are looking for. There is a free reader app which is a companion app to this english karuta called Hyakuninisshu EN. This reader app sings the poems in English, exactly like the Japanese poems with its unique melody because the translation we use, follows the waka form of the 5-7-5-7-7 syllables.<br/><br/>The game is comprised of two decks of cards, the Reader deck and the Player deck. Cards in the Reader deck contain the whole poem, while cards in the Player deck contain only the second part of these poems. To begin the game, a Reader is chosen (or you may opt to use the Reader app) and the players are divided into two teams sitting on opposite sides of the table or play area. The Reader shuffles the Reader deck and the Players mix, split evenly the Player deck between the teams and place them face-up in 3-4 rows in front of them. The Reader will read the complete poem on their cards and the player that finds the matching playing card first takes that card and puts it aside. If the card taken was on your opponent's side, you must give one card from your side to your opponent. The first team that has no cards left on their side is the winner (you must get rid of all your cards first, to win).<br/><br/>The game is set in Japan during the Genpei war (1180-1185). In order to win the war, you need a strategy. Place the cards you are familiar with close to you (in the beginning it is normal that none of the cards are familiar). If you know what cards your opponent is familiar with, place those cards as far as possible from them inside the playing field. Since the reader or app will always read the complete poem, you do not need prior knowledge of the poems. Strategically place the playing cards in a way that you can find and take them quickly such as laying them alphabetically or categorize them under the same first words.<br/><br/>",

The board is almost square (13.9&quot; x 12.8&quot;) and is divided into quadrants with player bases at the corners. There are two &quot;Bomber Stations&quot; at opposite corners and two &quot;Fighter Stations at the other corners, where players start their planes.<br/><br/>The game itself is a spin-and-move affair, with snakes-and-ladders type tracks in each quadrant leading to two shared final approach lanes to Berlin. The bomber and fighter tracks have different hazard and bonus squares. In addition to the bonus and hazard spaces, a plane landing on an occupied space must return to base.<br/><br/>Each player has four planes, and must fly them sequentially to Berlin, needing to spin a 6 for a plane either to take off from base or to return from Berlin.<br/><br/>",

Even the player pieces are flat cardboard!<br/><br/>The card game itself is basic: shuffle the deck and turn over the cards one at a time. Each card reveals the results of an at-bat: a hit, a walk, or an out. Players take turns revealing cards, moving runners on the board and scoring accordingly, until their third out; then the other player has his turn. As usual, the player with the most runs after nine innings wins.<br/><br/>While the cards are very plain and printed on thin yellow stock, they provide unusually detailed color commentary: &ldquo;Third Baseman Makes a Diving One-Handed Catch of Line Drive for an Out&rdquo;; or &ldquo;Ground Ball to Shortstop: He Throws High and Pulls First Baseman&rsquo;s Foot Off of Bag. Batter is Safe.&rdquo; There are supplementary instructions on each card for what happens to any runners.<br/><br/>",

Each round a deity from Olympus arrives, and you may either show devotion to that deity with an offering of gold, or cash in your devotion to that deity by asking them for a favor:<br/><br/><br/>     Zeus will advance your position on an initiative track, which brings rewards, preferential turn order, and initiative when resolving quests later in the turn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Hermes will bestow you with gold, which you can use to show your devotion to the deities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Ares will grant you troop movement, allowing you to add troops to the board and move them around.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Hephaestus will build you artifacts, buildings, and monuments for special effects or end game scoring.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of each cycle through the Olympus deck, you'll complete quests, and add a Hera card to the deck. When Hera arrives, you must meet her demands, and if you can, you will be rewarded with victory points!<br/><br/>At game end, you'll score points for the quests you've completed, the buildings you've erected, the cities you control, and the deities who's favor you've earned.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This mechanical game is like baseball crossed with a one-eyed bandit. The key to the game is a spinning roller mounted in one end of the plastic game case. Facing a baseball diamond that slopes down toward the players are 8 windows to cover all possible running situations: No one on, man on first, second or third, first and second, first and third, second and third, and bases loaded.<br/><br/>For each at-bat, the batting player pulls a lever on the side of the roller, which sets it spinning. When it stops, the result of the play is read out of the window that corresponds to the current state of the field. The results can vary widely: a home run with man on third can sit right next to pop-up out with man on second.<br/><br/>A baseball diamond covers most of the top of the game, with peg holes to enable runners to be tracked. Normal rules of baseball apply: three outs to an inning; nine innings to a game; highest score wins.<br/><br/>While the game is undated, it is likely c.1960, since the box shows the publisher as Hassenfeld Brothers but also displays the Hasbro mark that was used for years prior to the company name change in 1968.<br/><br/>",

The hidden face of each hexagon can show a truffle (white or black and of different sizes), a mouse, an event or a snake.<br/><br/>At the start of each turn, players receive a number of kibbles as written on the initiative card. These represent actions that animals can do: move from one hexagon to another, sniff that is secretly examine one of the adjacent hexagons or dig that is take one tile and put it on the character sheet. But take care! The work of the truffle hunters is troubled by a wild boar that can scare the animals and eat their truffles!<br/><br/>The game is played through 3 seasons. Every season has specific rules regarding protected mountains and legal truffles. Forest rangers monitor the player&rsquo;s behavior. They are activated by a roll dice and controlled by the active player.<br/><br/>At any point during the game, a player can decide to move to the little square and sell his truffles for Victory Points. At the end of the three seasons, the player with the most Victory Points is elected &ldquo;Truffle hunter of the year&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game of Zoom is a spin-and-move aviation race that involves four different spinners: a Dispatcher dial for take-off and landing, a second for determining Altitude, a third called Weather which governs movement forward, and a fourth called Radio which provides good/bad news as a result of some spins of the Weather dial.<br/><br/>The game is based on the birth of regular passenger air service in the United States, with each player flying between coastal terminals while stopping at cities along the way. There are four color-coded routes, and each player flies one plane E-W and the other W-E along his route.<br/><br/>Planes have a 50/50 chance of taking off or landing when they wish to do so, and if they fail, that player's turn passes. The altitude dial then determines how far into the sky spaces above the map that the plane moves, but this is for visual impact only. Planes must take off, move forward, and land at each city on their routes. Once a player has two planes en route, the Weather or Dispatcher spin can be used for either plane. Oddly, the four routes are not equal: two have 9 cities, one has 10, and the fourth (orange) has 12.<br/><br/>The game is undated, but because it was manufactured by E.E. Fairchild in Rochester while being marketed under the All-Fair brand, it was certainly published in 1938 or later, and most likely, given the theme, just after WWII.<br/><br/>",

This set introduces a new concept to Global War &ndash; the idea that players can spend more IPPs for advanced ordnance, which they then expend to improve their outcomes in combat.  Ordnance can improve combat values, improve the ability to select targets and in some cases give units abilities they don&rsquo;t have, like being able to hunt IPPs on convoy lines. But be careful &ndash; Ordnance is expensive and its cost adds up. Most of the ordnance in this set relies on players to have, or at least have started research on advanced technologies which adds additional time and cost.<br/><br/>",

Not only does every card you play have grave ramifications for the world at large, it also has a sardonic quote and description that was handcrafted by people who think they are funny.<br/><br/>Regent is a game about dark humor and betrayal, where your expertly executed play is rewarded by an unnerving realization that the world of politics is not that far removed from the depravity of this card game.<br/><br/>The cornerstone of Regent is the legislative mechanic. The regent has been given two to four policies and several bribes of varying values. Choosing a policy has several motivations - you can just choose the policy that gives you the most benefit or the one that harms the other players or choose because of the wonderful lobbying of the other players (i.e., several million dollars). Although the game runs on a purely mathematical system, the social aspect is what makes this game truly tense, entertaining, and thought provoking. Each chosen policy benefits one player or another, and in the end, whoever has the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Start by spreading the cards face down on the playing surface. The first player turns over two of the cards at random.  If the pair of cards turned over (for all to see) is not a matching pair, then the player turns them face down in the same position and the next player gets a turn.  If the pair forms a match, the player claims the cards and gets to turn over two more cards.  Play continues until all matches are found and claimed.

        "description": "ABACA is a game of endless variety. The deck consists of 108 cards.  Each card contains either a single letter or a combination of two letters as well as a scoring value.  There are five variations of the basic game that can be played: Primary ABACA, ABACA Royal, Argo ABACA, ABACA Rummy and Combination ABACA.<br/><br/>ABACA: Ten cards are dealt to each player.  The object of each hand is to try to be the first to use all ten cards to form words.  Play is simultaneous and each player uses their cards to form words.  After each player has made as many words as possible they discard one unused card and dealer then deals a new card to each player.  Cards are exchanged until someone declares ABACA meaning that all ten cards have been used in words.<br/><br/>Primary ABACA: Seven cards are dealt to each player and for each hand, every player places down a card - the winner of the hand is the person with the card closest to the letter &quot;A&quot;.  Player with the highest number of cards won is the winner.<br/><br/>ABACA Royal: Players add to previously played cards to create a new word.<br/><br/>ARGO ABACA: Players are dealt seven cards.  Players will add multiple cards to previously played cards to create words.<br/><br/>ABACA Rummy: Players are dealt seven cards. One card is placed face up.  First player takes either face up or top of deck and create as many words as he can in front of him and then discards one card.  Play continues and players can pick up any number of cards from discard stack as long as they play the bottom card each time.  Play continues until someone has used all their cards.<br/><br/>Combination ABACA: Can be played as game of solitaire or with several players.  Shuffle deck and place 25 cards face down in a 5 by 5 grid.  The remainder of the deck is placed on the center card.  Play begins by turning over any two cards.  If they form a word player places cards in their pile and is allowed another turn.  If they do not form a word, cards are turned back over and player takes a penalty card from center deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an early baseball card game, remarkably complex and well-accessorized for its time. The box includes a deck of 100 cards, a 12&quot; square green felt mat printed with a baseball field, and 18 ceramic chips (9 ivory and 9 rust-colored).<br/><br/>The deck has 22 Ball cards, 21 Strikes, 10 Fouls, 21 Outs, 4 Double Plays, 1 Triple Play, 4 Pick-offs, 3 Safe on Error, 1 Safe on Bunt, 1 Hit by Pitch, 6 Singles, 3 Doubles, 2 Triples and 1 Home Run. Many of the Ball, Strike and Out cards have contingent results depending on location of any baserunners: safe or out on steals, sacrifices, tag-up on flies, fielders choice, and even a passed ball. And one Ball card has &quot;Game called on account of rain&quot; (only if players have agreed in advance to include this result).<br/><br/>This highly detailed deck creates a deep narrative for each game, even if the play itself is simple, involving luck rather than strategy. The deck is shuffled, and the batting player turns over cards one at a time until a third out. Highest score after nine innings of three outs each wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This very rare 1962 title takes a multi-layered and highly strategic approach to the U.S. election campaign. It is designed for two players or teams. Components include a 4-part jigsaw-puzzle style board, a deck of weekly Event Cards, a deck of Daily Crisis cards, sets of red and blue counters, a campaign tally sheet, one red and one blue campaign die, a rules book and a summary playing sequence card.<br/><br/>Each state is classified by region, political philosophy (Liberal/Conservative), party preference (Democrat/Republican) and key economic interest (Mining, Manufacturing or Farming). Each party begins by choosing Presidential and VP home states (with local and regional benefits) and political philosophy (Conservative, Liberal or Moderate).<br/><br/>Each campaign week starts with an Event card that combines a random bonus/penalty event with a political statement or proposal. Candidates get penalties and bonuses depending on the stand they support. For instance, supporting a Southern Senator's controversial statement adds 3 regional points in the South but costs 1 in other regions and 2 in each Liberal state; denouncing has an opposite effect.<br/><br/>Each week has six campaign days. On each day, the candidate can make a personal appearance in any one state, adding 5 points in that state, sometimes modified by that day's Crisis card. Each party also has a limited number of media campaigns that can be targeted locally (+8), regionally (+3) or nationally (+1). Point counters are used to show net advantage in each state and in boxes for regions, economic interests, political philosophy and the nation as a whole, while the party advantages in each state are marked on the board.<br/><br/>The game runs for 9 weeks plus the Monday before Election Day. On election day, the result for each state is determined by tallying each party's net advantage in national, regional and local support, economic interest, political philosophy and party advantage, modified by a final -2 to +2 die roll by each party. The party with the highest net wins that state's electoral college votes, and 270 EC votes wins the election. An EC vote tie is broken by number of states won, with the District of Columbia being the final tie-breaker.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Emily Is Probably Dead By Now<br/>A sinister game of bluffing and collusion for 4-6 players.<br/><br/>Gameplay begins with all players guilty of murdering Emily and hiding the body.<br/>Everyone at the table is guilty and is looking for a way out.<br/>Each player begins with pieces of evidence that they must stash in order to get away with murder and win the game leaving the other players to waste away behind bars.<br/><br/>During each round of the game players will play location cards face down claiming that they are helping the town search party look for the &quot;missing&quot; Emily. The rest of the group needs to decide if you are actually checking a location or trying to stash evidence when nobody is looking.<br/><br/>If you get caught hiding evidence you will gain suspicion which will make it more difficult to get rid of your current evidence and if you are caught trying to collude with other players you will gain additional pieces of evidence.<br/><br/>Ok.....so get rid of evidence that's it right? It can't get much worse then committing a murder and having evidence on you as you help search for the missing person. Well that is true until one unlucky player ends up actually picking up Emily and must now get rid of this very damming piece of evidence .<br/>If any player is caught with Emily's body the game immediately ends and that player will receive the death penalty while all other players will serve jail sentences based on how much evidence they currently have in their hand.<br/><br/>Game Highlights<br/><br/>Bluffing<br/>Bluffing and hiding your true intentions is the heart and sole of this game. The mechanics were developed to not get in the way or hinder your ability to bluff your way through a tough situation. There are situations in the game that will test your metal and challenge your ability to maintain a convincing deception.<br/><br/>Collusion<br/>Players will have opportunities on the fly to quickly decide to work with each other to get further in the game but beware there can only be one winner and colluding with others carries a much higher penalty and invites a firm back-stab from savvy players looking to catch you off guard.<br/><br/>Quick Game Play<br/>Emily Is Probably Dead is very quick to learn and each game takes about 20-30 mins to conclude. Making this a perfect filler game to play in between other games or as a quick fun gaming experience with very little time commitment.<br/><br/>A New Twist On the Who Dunnit Theme<br/>&quot;So who dunnit?&quot;......&quot;You all did!&quot; now its a question of who is going to get caught and who is going to get away with murder!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This checkers-type naval wargame covering the Atlantic Ocean theater was published in 1941 as simply Game of Defense. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor late that year, an Atlantic sticker was added to the box, and a companion board covering the Pacific Ocean was published, using the same parts box but with a Pacific sticker added.<br/><br/>The Atlantic map is a red-and-white checkerboard with green land areas drawn on the eastern and western edges. Five ports are circled on each side: Scapa Flow, Brest, Lisbon, Gibraltar and Dakar on the Europe/Africa side, and Halifax, New York, Charleston, New Orleans and Panama on the Americas side.<br/><br/>Each side gets four each of three types of ship: battleships move 1-4 squares only on red; cruisers move 1-3 squares on white; and submarines move a single square without restriction. Battleships and cruisers destroy opposing ships by jumping over them (and can jump over a square of opposite color to do so), while submarines kill by moving onto another ship.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player draws one of five Objective cards naming a port on the opposite side, and also writes down 10 numbered squares (of 50 on the board off both coasts) as secret minefields. Players move alternately, either a single ship or up to 5 ships on adjoining squares as a fleet move. If a ship moves onto or over a minefield, a card is drawn from the deck showing the consequences.<br/><br/>The winner is the first to have the stated number of ships reach shore at that player's Objective.<br/><br/>",

Tactical Firefight has captured the essence of the nature of combat during these turbulent times. In the game one player will play Coalition Forces while the other player will be playing the insurgent forces. Contained in the first installment of the Tactical Firefight Series are missions from Operation Enduring Freedom(OEF). The US lead invasion of Afghanistan in 2001-present. Gameplay will involve a scenario deck in which the Coalition player draws a card from his/her scenario deck. Reveals this to his/her opponent and set up the game likewise for that scenario. As well as these scenario cards. Once the mission is set up each player will then draw a card from their respective objective decks. For the insurgent player this objective is secondary to stopping the Coalition player from achieving the mission goal. So for the Coalition player this objective is secondary to the overall mission. If these objectives are completed during the game however will affect the amount of victory points at the end of the mission. Tactical Firefight will also be able to be played solo with just as much depth as when playing against an opponent.<br/><br/>",

During the Second World War many nations operated hidden submarine bases in remote locations around the world.  These bases were nestled in isolated coasts and sometimes even in Neutral counties.<br/><br/>What you set out to do in secrecy doesn&rsquo;t always happen the way you plan it.  Thus, what base an Alliance obtains is governed by a bit of randomness....as you will soon discover!<br/><br/>This expansion allows players to build secret submarine bases around the world. Because of their ability to hide, these bases can't be bombed while allowing you to extend the reach of your submarines around the world.<br/><br/>",

Alaska was a major air hub for lend-lease aircraft ferried aircraft to Russia through the Northwest Air Staging Route In response to increasing Japanese aggression the US built naval stations in Kodiak Island, Sitka and Dutch harbor during the 1930's. War planners saw the 1,200 mile Aleutian Chain as &ldquo;stepping stones&rdquo; to the invasion of Alaska (and ultimately the mainland U.S.).<br/><br/>In Alaskan Warriors Global War players will find new rules for Pacific lend-lease to Russia, rules governing remote and road-less territories.  New markers are provided for the Alaska Territorial Guard, ALSIB Air-Ferry route, seaplane bases, and the ALCAN military highway. We&rsquo;ve even included the never completed Alaska-Siberia railway project which would have established a bridge across the Bering Strait.    Finally, we&rsquo;ve included the PBY-5A Catalina seaplane (3D printed) which was one of the iconic aircraft that served in the Alaskan theatre.<br/><br/>",

She continued to shout to her officers last moment, desperate instructions: &ldquo;Heads low! Stay behind the car doors or anything else solid. And if whatever we are hearing turns out to be way heavier than I think &ndash; if it shoots at you, don&rsquo;t hesitate to RUN back to the Rally Point.&rdquo;<br/><br/>AMERICA BREACHED is the fourth volume in The WORLD AT WAR 85 SERIES of games of fast and furious platoon-level combat. The series is set in 1985, in an alternate history of World War III. With the Warsaw Pact armies deep into Western Europe, and war zones appearing around the world drawing away U.S. ground reinforcements, an unlikely yet powerful collection of allies seize the opportunity to storm across the Rio Grande in force, raiding deep into Texas, ostensibly to deny the U.S. parts of its oil resources. If they succeed in their goal, they potentially might disrupt U.S. military operations worldwide.<br/><br/>The WORLD AT WAR 85 system features a unique combat system that involves die rolls by both attacking units and defending units, which keeps both players engaged throughout the game. Die rolls are compared and hits applied quickly, as all the information you need to fight your units is on the counters. No combat results table is necessary. Initiative, formation activation, random turn length, close air support and air cover are all integrated smoothly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the rules:<br/><br/>The year is 1400 BCE. The fabled Labyrinth of Konoso, better known as the Labyrinth of Knossos, has suffered a catastrophe! Parts have been burned, other bits have collapsed, making it nearly impossible to escape. All you have to guide your way are the scribe's tokens, which match certain doorways, allowing you to pass. Will you be able to make it out of the labyrinth alive?<br/><br/>At the start of the game, you roll to see how many of each type of scribe's tokens you receive.  There are six types of tokens, each one associated with a different Linear B Ideogram.  If you ever roll for only one of a particular token type, you can choose a rotation token.  There are six unique rotations tokens, which move the hex tiles in different ways.<br/><br/>You start the game at the center start hex, encircled by two concentric circles of hex tiles, the first circle containing six tiles, the second circle containing twelve tiles.  The goal is to make it to one of the six exit hexes, located at various points beyond the second circle.<br/><br/>To move through the labyrinth, you match the token you have with the doorway you walk through.  The token only has to match the doorway of the tile you are on - not the tile you are traveling to.  Once you run out of a type of token, you can no longer walk through doors of that type.<br/><br/>Will you be able to make it to the exit before your tokens run out?<br/><br/>",
