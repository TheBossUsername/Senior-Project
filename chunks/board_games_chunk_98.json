        "description": "In the new card game of the Starnberger Spiele publishing house and the author Tanja Philippeit, the aim of the players is to collect the lowest possible scores in a display of nine initially hidden cards. You could almost mean &quot;No Prob-Lama&quot;. But far from it! In addition to a bit of luck in drawing cards, &quot;No Prob-Lama&quot; is especially about clever tactics. Otherwise you end up with an unintentionally high score. And as if that was not enough, then a drama lama or a karma lama can get in the way.<br/><br/>Each player receives nine cards, which he disguises in a rectangle arranged in front of him. These are revealed during the course of the game and exchanged with cards from the stack. The goal is to have the lowest possible card values ​​in your display at the end of a round. You can even achieve minus points by collecting three identical cards in a row or a column. A round ends as soon as a player has revealed all nine cards. Who then has the lowest score, wins the round and may grab a piece of wood in the form of a lama. The first to collect three Lama pieces, ie to win three rounds, is the winner.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not that easy. The collection of triplets is very attractive, but at the same time quite risky. Because the trick here is: the higher the numbers of the cards are in a treble, the more minuses you get. However, if a teammate finished the round, before you could complete the treble, you sit on solid plus points. And you definitely do not want them in this game. So you better play it safe and only collect low cards or rather speculate on the highest possible triplet? Some players even come up with the idea to end the round intentionally fast, when his teammates are currently working on a treble with high cards to mess up their tour. For proper vortex care in between all the special cards. With the drama lama one buzzes additional points on a fellow player. With the Karma Lama on the other hand, you have to give away minus points. There the joy is great - for the others!<br/><br/>So while you optimize your own display, you must constantly keep an eye on the players. Most importantly, you should avoid discarding a card that the next player can use for his triplets collection.<br/><br/>",

Jeder Spieler erh&auml;lt zu Beginn des Spiels ein Pl&auml;ttchen, das er anschaut und verdeckt vor sich ablegt. Der Rest ergibt den Nachzugstapel.<br/><br/>Alle Guselpl&auml;ttchen sind f&uuml;r den ausspielenden Spieler positiv.<br/>Es gibt pro Gruselpl&auml;ttchen jeweils ein Symbol, das den Verwendungszeitpunkt angibt: Entweder<br/><br/>a) in einem Zug    (Spieler Symbol)    oder b) jederzeit (Uhr Symbol)<br/><br/>[es gibt 11 a) und 5 b) Pl&auml;ttchen]<br/><br/>Spielverlauf:Zieht ein Spieler eine seiner Figuren aus dem Keller wieder auf die Galerie, erh&auml;lt er ein Pl&auml;ttchen vom Nachzugstapel. Limit pro Spieler sind 2 Gruselpl&auml;ttchen! Sollte ein Spieler ein drittes Pl&auml;ttchen erhalten, muss er sofort eines der 3 Pl&auml;ttchen ablegen.<br/>Ein Gruselpl&auml;ttchen kann nicht im gleichen Zug, in dem man es eh&auml;lt, aber jederzeit (dem Verwendungszeitpunkt entsprechend) danach eingesetzt werden. Ein Spieler kann nur ein Pl&auml;ttchen pro Zug ausspielen. Genutzte Pl&auml;ttchen kommen auf ein Ablagestapel. Sollte der Nachzugstapel aufgebraucht sein, wird der Ablagestapel gemischt und als neuer Nachsugstapel genutzt.&quot;<br/><br/>Aproximate translation (by kurtsg):<br/>&quot;Fright-tiles<br/><br/>It is played on the Board side with the fright points on the edge. All rules from the &quot;basic version&quot; remain.<br/><br/>Additional rules for the 16 fright-tiles:<br/>Game preparation: The fright tiles are shuffled face down. Each player begins the game with one tile he looks at and then places face down in front of him. The rest of tiles build the draw pile.<br/><br/>All fright tiles are positive for the player playing them.<br/>Each fright tile has one symbol on it that indicates the time of use: Either<br/><br/>a) in the players turn (grey/black player icon) or b) at any time (clock icon)<br/>[there are 11 a) and 5 b) tiles]<br/><br/>During play: If a player moves one of his figures from the cellar back to the gallery, he receives a tile from the draw pile. Limit per player are 2 fright tiles! Should a player receive a third tile, he must immediately discard one of the 3 tiles.<br/>A fright tile can not be used in the turn it is adquired, but inmediately after (using the corresponding time of use indicated by the symbol on the tile). A player may play only one tile per turn. Used tiles are put on a discard pile. If the draw pile is exhausted, the discard pile is shuffled and used as a new draw pile.&quot;<br/><br/>",

They then each secretly use their location dials to declare their intended meeting point.<br/><br/>The Mods, in a short amount of time, then have to determine where they expect the Dissidents to meet by inferring their intent from a book of every possible code set the subversives could use, and agree upon a location to direct a state raiding party.<br/><br/>Once they've agreed on a location, the Dissidents each reveal their location dials. Depending on whether the majority of Dissidents have successfully coordinated at a single location, or the Mods have caught them in an attempt at subversion will determine whether that location becomes 'hacked' or 'moderated'.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, moderated locations produce potential accomplices for the Dissidents to recruit, as undesirables are driven from now sanitized districts. However, as the Dissidents progress their mission to 'hack' as many locations as possible, the Moderators strike back with increasing numbers of surveillance outposts, installed to limit the Dissident's ability to move around the city undetected.<br/><br/>NewSpeak: Deluxe Edition includes the NewSpeak base game and two expansions - Rated and Sabotage - all packaged inside one box.<br/><br/>",

Crocofant offers two game variants: one a memory game in which one of two dice shows whether an animal outline or an animal pattern must be found. Whoever has just noticed the hiding place of the giraffe must now look for the tiger stripes.<br/><br/>The other way to play is as a reaction game in which a certain combination of animal outlines and patterns is searched for amongst the face-up cards. Who can combine the combinations fastest and snap up the corresponding animal?<br/><br/>",

You are helped on your way by taking short-cut paths if they are landed on, but you are also hindered if you land on a burrow, and you take a short-cut backwards!<br/><br/>The game is designed as if it was Beatrix Potter herself who had created it. All the parts and pieces used are made in materials that would have been available to her. The box is small and compact to take the well thought out pieces and is in keeping with the small book itself.<br/><br/>Snakes and Ladders is a Victorian game brought back from India and has the concept of good and bad, just right for Peter Rabbit. The illustrations used in the board design show Peter being naughty at one end of the burrow and then the result of being naughty at the other after he goes down. On the Path when he is good he goes up and the illustrations at either end depict this.<br/><br/>The game is very simple and can be played by three year old's upward. It should take no longer than five minutes to play, the concentration span of children of that age and perfect before bedtime. Hence the simple Paths and Burrows on the board and there being only 49 squares. If you want to spend longer then play more times, best of three etc.<br/><br/>The large wooden die has large numbers to help a child learn the numbers from 1 to 6. Each number is also decorated with the same number of rabbits. So there is one on the 1 and two on the 2 etc. Children will love counting these to see what number they have thrown. You can then move this number on the board. This will help them understand the relationship with the board numbers and the dice at an early age.<br/><br/>The pieces are Peter and the three Flopsy bunnies in stone resin and with painted jackets. They will bring Peter alive on the board to a young persons mind.<br/><br/>It is a gift item not a toy. By spending time with the game and taking care of it a child will come to appreciate it as they grow old. The textures and shapes and illustrations all blending to create an experience they will always remember.<br/><br/>",

Just the timing of events created by you and your opponents given the limited options available to the players. Player options (including tile movement and token stealing) are determined by the board tile upon which their pawn rests (each tile allows 2 to 3 options for the player) and the hidden Power Up Cards each player chose at the beginning of the game. Player's must weigh their options wisely to determine the most advantageous choice for themselves while undermining their opponents!<br/><br/>There are two versions of the exact same game available. A Full Color Version, all inclusive, full game, print and play; and/or a Black and White &quot;CB&quot; Version (the original game testers' ashcan version), players will need to supply a deck of cards and a token for each player for the B&amp;W version.

The first player to empty his or her hand without being eliminated is the winner.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he can either pass or play some cards. If he passes, he does nothing: it is simply the next player's turn. If he chooses to play, he lays down one or more cards and announces a number, which is seven or lower. For example, if he announces &quot;six&quot; and plays 3 cards face down, he is claiming that those 3 cards are all number &quot;six&quot; cards.<br/><br/>If no one challenges, it is the next player's turn. The next player has to either pass or play some cards, just like the previous player, but he must announce a lower number than what the previous player claimed.<br/><br/>If someone decides to challenge (&quot;Peep&quot;), she opens the cards played by the current player. If the challenge fails (i.e., the challenged player was honest), the challenger should take all the cards played so far. If the challenge succeeds, the challenged player should take all the cards played so far (or will be eliminated from the game immediately if there is any Lady Godiva card among the played cards).<br/><br/>Play continues in this manner until there is a single winner.<br/><br/>",

Each of the chicks and hens fit on magnetic bases. Players throw the die and move their hen along the path. When the hen comes to a hiding chick, she moves as close as possible. The chick will either cling to the mother or be repelled, indicating which hen is the mother. The clinging chicks are taken back by the mother to home. First player to return 3 chicks wins.<br/><br/>Note that this game cannot (fairly) be played with three players, as this would leave one player (who has the hen polarized differently to the other two) with a wider selection of chicks, and thus would need to move less to obtain them.<br/><br/>",

The pawns' strengths are decided by a two-dimensional scissors-paper-stone method, based on some of Aisopos' fables: The human outsmarts the fox, the fox takes the mouse, but the mouse defeats the human. The Lion defeats both human, fox and mouse, which in turn all three defeat the ant. But the ant is the only one who defeats the lion.<br/><br/>Players start with 2 of each creature and take turns either placing a hidden pawn or moving an already placed pawn. If you move onto another pawn, the attacker secretly looks at the defending pawn, and the defeated pawn is taken off the board and placed before the winning pawn's player.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player is completely out of pawns, and the winner is the player who has most points in defeated pawns. The different creatures are worth different amount of points.<br/><br/>",

Players should look at BOTH sides of their letter cards, and can either hold their cards in their hands or lay them out on the table.<br/><br/>Place the stack of ITZI cards in the center of the table.<br/><br/><br/>     One player flips over the top ITZI card and puts it in the center for all to read --or someone can read it out loud.<br/>     Players quickly look at their letter cards (both front and back) and call out a word that answers the ITZI card and that starts with one of their letters. For example, let&rsquo;s say the ITZI card reads, &ldquo;It&rsquo;z an animal.&rdquo; If a player has a letter card with a &ldquo;K&rdquo; on it, they could call out &ldquo;kangaroo&rdquo; and at the same time smack down that letter card on top of the ITZI card. (They also could have used the other letters on the card and said, &ldquo;Tiger!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Iguana!&rdquo; or &ldquo;Newt!&rdquo;.)<br/>     The first player to call out a correct answer and smack down their letter card gets to discard it.<br/>     A new ITZI card is flipped over and play continues.<br/>     The first player to get rid of all five of his/her letter cards wins the game!<br/><br/><br/>BY THE WAY&hellip;<br/><br/>The letter you use must be the first letter of your answer. For example, if the ITZI card reads, &ldquo;It&rsquo;z a breed of dog&rdquo; and you answer &ldquo;Golden Retriever&rdquo; you must slap down the letter &ldquo;G&rdquo; (not &ldquo;R&rdquo;). Or if the card reads, &ldquo;It&rsquo;z a drink with bubbles&rdquo; and you answer &ldquo;Root Beer&rdquo; you must slap down an &ldquo;R.&rdquo;<br/><br/>If a player calls out a wrong answer, they have to take back their letter card, and they also have to take an additional letter card as a penalty.<br/><br/>One option is to play where the winner of the previous game gets to read the ITZI cards for the next game. (That person is not an active player when they are the reader.)<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Either to battle alien raiders, to track down a slithering serpent, to blast away at threatening missiles, or to run away from a very hungry monster.<br/>It take skill to score points on THE MACHINE but it takes strategy to win the game. For Arcade Mania challenges you to collect chips during a match... and chips are accumulated either by winning on THE MACHINE yourself or by betting successfully on other players tackling THE MACHINE. You'll discover that WHO to bet on and HOW MUCH to bet takes clever planning and plotting.&quot;<br/><br/>The four arcade games are very simple and are played at three different skill levels, as decided by a throw of a die. The game features a colorful board (19 1/2 x 24 inches) and THE MACHINE, which requires six AA batteries.<br/><br/>",

Each die has a custom face with its special symbol.  The game's main mechanic is that an attacker (the one in possession of the ball) succeeds in his or her action by rolling a number higher than or equal to the defender's; special symbols tend to trump numbers.<br/><br/>The dice are placed on the board such that the centers face off against each other, while the forwards go against the guards.  The game starts with a roll-off between the centers.  The winner gains the ball (represented by the offensive marker), which grants a bonus to the attacker's dice rolls.  Only forwards and centers can take shots to score points; the guards steal the ball.  All positions can pass among each other.<br/><br/>The first player to reach an agreed-on score wins and ends the game.<br/><br/>",

The players represent two photographers willing to take pictures of neat subjects, like animals, in order to gather the most points. The game is played in two rounds. During each round, each player plays his own deck of cards: the deck is used both to move the photographer along the path, and to take a picture at the right moment. Animals turn out along the circular mountain trail, and a photographer needs to be ahead of the other if he wants to take a good picture: it is important to have a clear view, i.e. not blocked by anyone. Each subject is represented on a tile, and it is worth a certain amount of points, i.e. &quot;cameras&quot;, in this game. At the end of the round, the players exchange the decks so they will both have the same chance of playing, then new subjects are drawn, and a new round starts. At the end of the game, the winner is the photographer with the most &quot;cameras&quot;.<br/><br/>This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.<br/><br/>",

Each is colored coded to represent the lengths of different musical notes and has a number from 1 to 6. Each card also has a short biography of the composer, but this is not relevant to the game.<br/>6 playing pieces - each representing a different musical instrument (harp, violin, trumpet drum, piano and saxophone)<br/>1 colored die - each face has a different color and musical note<br/>1 numerical die - D6<br/>Paper money - in 6 colors - each with a musical symbol and name (as for the composers and colored die).<br/>Money converter card - this gives the relative value of the each color of paper money.<br/><br/>Players throw the two dice which determine a position (composer) on the board to which the players playing piece is moved (i.e. 5 Green is Dvorak). Money is also earned according to the same dice roll - 5 Green means that 5 pieces of green money are received.<br/><br/>If the Composer is owned by another player then a forfeit must be paid. If not the Composer may be bought.<br/><br/>During his turn a player may also purchase up to 10 pieces of music from each Composer that they own.<br/><br/>A supplementary action (forfeit, movement or bonus) is also determined from the inner wheel based on the same dice roll (5 Green for example is &quot;Pass to Bach&quot;).<br/><br/>Play proceeds in such a way - move, receive money, purchase a composer/pay a forfeit, purchase works, central wheel action - until one player has purchased 6 Composers - one in each color and amassed 10 pieces of music from each of the composers owned.<br/>An advanced version of the game introduces a quiz book round in which players are also asked to attempt a definition of a musical phrase or term.

        "description": "THE GLASGOW GAME is one of a series of Monopoly style board game developed by local YMCAs in the UK to generate funds for their activities. The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case the City of GLASGOW in the Heart of Scotland. The YMCA there is famous for its large hostel, housing some 400 young men.<br/><br/>This game is distinctly different from the other Ricken/Triaktiv games being predominantly Black in colour where the norm is a green or plum colour. See the pictures for greater detail of this.<br/><br/>Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.<br/><br/>Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.<br/><br/>Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/>- After a set time.<br/>- When the first player becomes bankrupt.<br/>- When all but one player has gone bankrupt.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of a clockwork powered clothes line that rotates and four dogs that leap up when a paddle is pressed (or hit). The four colors are red, blue, green and yellow.<br/><br/>To set up, you attach 12 articles of clothing to the washing line, three of each color of pants, shirt and socks (in increasing order of difficulty), wind up the mechanism and let it go. The clothes line spins and the players hit the paddles to make their dog leap up to grab the clothing.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the person the highest score. you get 10 points for pants, 15 for the tee-shirt and 20 for the socks in your color. Each article of clothing your dog gets that isn't in your color costs you 30 points, so it pays to be a bit careful.<br/><br/>A warning to parents... This is quite a noisy game to play, but each game only lasts for about two minutes.<br/><br/>",

Each comes with a deck of 24 card printed with some astronomy trivia. The mechanics are similar to Trivial Pursuit. One player draws a card and asks the opponent a trivia question from it. A correct answer allows the player to put a mark in a tic-tac-toe box on the game board.  For each completed row or column on the game board the player scores its point value. As each of the 9 squares on the tic-tac-toe board has a different value, there is some strategy here. Correct answers to 6 of the 24 cards enable a choice to mark a tic-tac-toe square or to erase an opponents mark. A simple plastic cover allows write-on/wipe off. <br/>The gameboard and card can also be used for a much simpler form of tic-tac-toe for the younger players.<br/><br/>",

Graf Spee comes complete with die-cut counters, rules booklet, battle board and two movement boards.&quot;<br/><br/>Another entry in the long line of AH Bismarck-style search and battle naval wargames, this one is very rare. As the name implies, it covers the search for the German &quot;pocket battleship&quot; Graf Spee in 1939.<br/><br/>With the usual low-quality Third Millenia components (especially the counters) and very simple rules, it is nevertheless a pretty fun game.<br/><br/>Like AH Bismarck, Midway, et al, movement and search are conducted on the two identical map sheets, and battles are resolved on the battle and charts sheet. Turn order is:<br/>a. German player rolls for bad weather (no searches). German player moves.<br/>b. British player searches.<br/>c. British player moves.<br/>d. German player searches.<br/>e. If both in same hex, resolve battle.<br/>f. When all battles are resolved, advance the turn record and start over.<br/><br/>The British can search the hexes ships are in, and one more hex within four hexes (search aircraft). Aircraft carriers (4 British and 1 French) can search the six adjacent hexes. The German player can search the hexes ships are in, plus the Graf Spee has two search aircraft that can search within four hexes. The German player can also search any other three hexes on the board (u-boat reports?).<br/><br/>Both players must keep track of fuel expenditures, and both have supply ships available to re-fuel (or they can re-fuel in ports). Every other turn the German player can roll on a table to sink one (or two) merchantmen. If he sinks any, he then rolls on another table to see how many turns later he must inform the British player in which hex the sinking occurred. The German player must sink a number of merchant ships and escape the map to win; otherwise the British player wins.<br/><br/>No indication is given of map or time scale. I suspect search board turns are one day. 20 turns to a game.<br/><br/>Components: two identical 14&quot; x 24&quot; hex-gridded search map sheets, one 14&quot; x 24&quot; battle and chart sheet, one rule folder (five small pages), plus 119 of 1/2-inch die-cut unit counters. <br/>I think there were 24 actual ship counters, some &quot;?&quot; s and &quot;search&quot; counters, and a bunch of blanks (my copy is unfortunately incomplete).<br/><br/>",

The player to the left, the &quot;Caller&quot;, announces whether he or she believes the Declarer.  If the Caller believes the Declarer then the Caller takes the cups and is the new declarer, and must declare a higher poker hand from the dice under the cups, with the player to the left as the new Caller.  Play continues until a Caller accuses the Declarer of being a liar, and the dice are revealed.  If the Declarer was lying then the declarer must pay out, but if the Declarer was telling the truth, the Declarer collects from the other players.<br/><br/>The rules as printed don't give a lot of detail about the game.  Though money is provided, it's not made clear how bets take place, nor what the game ending conditions are.  Presumably, like Liar's Dice, the game would end when one player has all of the money, and players would be eliminated when they have no money.<br/><br/>Unlike Liar's Dice, only one player is rolling at one time, and there are a total of five dice that are rolled.<br/><br/>",

Soon players will be able to buy companies like Alticor, Meijer and Steelcase while moving pieces shaped like local landmarks like Calder's La Grande Vitesse.<br/><br/>The project was spearheaded by the Collegiate Entrepreneurs' Organization (CEO) at Grand Valley. Business sponsorships and sales of the game will raise funds to establish a CEO student scholarship at Grand Valley.<br/>The game board is patterned after the familiar Monopoly board, but it features prominent local businesses in the place of the original names. Boardwalk is Alticor, Park Place is Meijer, and Steelcase is Pacific Avenue (the three highest valued properties in the game). Other featured businesses are Behler-Young, Louis Padnos Iron and Metal Company, The Gilmore Collection, 1913 Room, Rockford Construction, Old Orchard, WZZM, Grand Valley State, Calvin College, and Aquinas College. The hotels will be shaped as the Amway Grand, and houses will represent the conservatory at the Frederick Meijer Gardens. Tokens will also be shaped as local attractions, such as the La Grande Vitesse, Leonardo Da Vinci Horse, John Ball statue, and other area landmarks.<br/><br/>Full text availalble here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gvsu.edu/forms/ceo/Media/monopoly2.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.gvsu.edu/forms/ceo/Media/monopoly2.pdf</a><br/><br/>Another article on the project may be found here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gvsu.edu/successstory/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.story&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.gvsu.edu/successstory/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.s...</a>;id=FA32E53B-E926-4249-DCBD5FC17644C204<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A chess variant in which spaces have a card with a picture of a chess piece drawn on it which determines the move of the player's pawns. It is played on a 6 by 6 grid; to start with only the end zones have cards on them, but each turn another (face up from a stack)is placed onto an empty space. Pawns starting from spaces without cards can only move forward or backwards and can't capture.<br/><br/>The game is thus partly about conventional chess and partly about constructing the board to favour yourself.<br/><br/>My copy was sold as a double game with Thataway, with which it shares a board and some pieces; I don't know if it has ever been sold separately.<br/><br/>I believe this game was originally sold as Chafts, as early as 1986. David Watts visited Cardiff to trial it.<br/><br/>",

The competitors drive an armored and armed cars and the main rule of the race is that the winner takes all.<br/><br/>&quot;Szalenczy Wyscig&quot; (&quot;The Mad Race&quot;) simulates car race taking into account different road surface (ice, cinder, tarmac), car equipment (including different types of tires, armor, weapon, engines). The track is build with modular board and it is possible to make 8 different tracks. The players decide what is track surface - it can vary along the way - and they can place in some additional obstacles like ditches or oil splodges.<br/><br/>Game mechanics is based on secret planning the car movement for a game round. The players are using the special &quot;car sheets&quot; and reveal their movement simultaneously. They can not only plan the movement but also they can use weapons. If the cars are on the same field depending on their speed and planned movement type they can hit each other or avoid collision.<br/><br/>After the race the players get their prices depending on their place. With money prices they can repair and upgrade cars buying additional equipment. The winner is chosen after several races.<br/><br/>",

Some squares feature hazards which delay the player. Route tiles can be placed in any position, at any time throughout the game, on each players turn.<br/><br/>The getaway car, helicopter, landslide and tree markers can be used to move the players piece further, or to obstruct other players.<br/><br/>Game components consist of quality heavy duty card tiles, a moulded plastic board, and hand painted pieces.<br/><br/>The game is notable for being one of the earliest examples of a tile laying game, with each game producing a new road layout for players to travel.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Polar Quizz is trivia-type game about the polar environment, both arctic and antarctic: fauna, polar explorers, geography, indigenous people, etc.<br/><br/>No particular knowledge on the subject is required to play. Players just need to use their memory, as the facts are given along the game. Thus, kids can easily win against adults, and learn valuable information at the same time.<br/><br/>The game is made of 100 square cards. Each card displays the picture of an animal, a polar explorer, a map, etc... All the questions and answers are gathered in a booklet. Each card has a number referring to a set of questions and their answers in the booklet. This feature allows the games to be easily translated in many different languages. Currently, each box contains 4 languages: English, French, German and Norwegian.<br/><br/>Players try to win cards by answering their questions. Each card yields points and the winner is the first to score 7 points. If a player gives the wrong answers to a card, the right answers are given to all the participants. Hence, later in the game, this card becomes easier to be won, but only if  you could memorize these answers.<br/><br/>",

Players take on the roles of heavily armed women battling everything from Drunken Frat Boys to Bthulhu and more. One player controls the monsters and NPCs while the rest play the women. Characters are created with a point based system governing the stats of Strength, Dexterity, Macho, Looks, and Health. (There is no Intelligence score), as well as various skills like &quot;Run in High Heels&quot; and &quot;Hit Things With Things&quot;...<br/>Combat and skill use is based on a 3d6 roll system combined with double-sided cut-out paper miniatures (cardboard bimbos), and hex boards supplied with the game.

        "description": "A board game with the strategy of chess and the simplicity of checkers.<br/><br/>Players have 3 colors to choose from: blue, red &amp; yellow (BRY).  Each player controls 9 pieces of their color: 3 square pieces, 3 hex pieces and 3 round pieces. Printed on each piece is the shape of the kind of opponents&rsquo; piece it can capture: square, hex or round.<br/><br/>Each player has one square piece that can capture opposing square pieces, one square piece that can capture opposing hex pieces and one square piece that can capture opposing round pieces. The same is true for hex pieces and round pieces.<br/><br/>The playing board is triangular shaped with 3 types of sections: 3 Nests (where pieces start the game), 3 Pens (where captured pieces go) and the Ring (a center section where the action takes place).<br/><br/>Pieces start the game in their nest and move directly to any empty space in the ring. They capture opponents&rsquo; pieces by moving straight-line to, and replacing, the captured piece in its space. The captured piece is sent to the Pen.<br/><br/>When a piece moves into capture position on an opponent&rsquo;s piece, prior to capturing it, it can &ldquo;freeze&rdquo; the opposing piece by flipping it over. The flipped piece is frozen (cannot move) for one turn.<br/><br/>There a 3 types of normal moves: Nest-to-Ring (described above), swapping a piece from the Pen with a piece in the Ring and moving a piece inside the Ring.<br/><br/>There is one special moved called a &ldquo;release&rdquo;, which can occur in a 3-player game if a player is getting &ldquo;ganged up on&rdquo; or it can be considered a handicap move for beginning players. It is made by moving a previously captured piece from the Pen back to its nest to return to play.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the last player to have at least one un-captured piece remaining, after all opponents&rsquo; pieces have been captured and placed in their Pen.<br/><br/>The symmetry of the game board combines with a simple game-play routine, creating several layers of strategy with respect to piece positioning and piece selection.<br/><br/>",

Picture cards and jokers should be dealt face down.<br/><br/>Standard 2 player game:<br/>- Player 1 has the red number cards (red spiders)<br/>- Player 2 has the black number cards (black spiders)<br/>- Court cards and jokers are flies<br/><br/>Each turn consists of a player making a capture:<br/>- The player moves a spider of their colour over any number of friendly pieces and empty spaces onto any fly or an enemy spider of equal or lower value.<br/>- Movement is orthogonal only <br/>- If no capture is posible, the player must pass<br/><br/>When both players pass, the game ends.  Players score 1 point for each remaining spider of their colour, and 1 point for each captured card.<br/><br/>3-4 player rules:<br/>Each player gets the number cards in 1 suit.  In a 3 player game, there will be a neutral colour of spider.  These do not move, but can be captured according to the normal rules.<br/><br/>",

However, the general knowledge part of the game cannot be played until the jigsaw board has been completed.<br/><br/>The jigsaw was 32&quot; x 18&quot;, and at the time of production was the largest cardboard jigsaw ever made.<br/><br/>Game contents:<br/><br/>1 map of the world in the form of a 32&quot; x 18&quot; jigsaw<br/>1 paper map of the world (as a reference for the jigsaw)<br/>4 sets of capital city counters (red, blue, green and white)<br/><br/>In the general knowledge part of the game, each player in turn tries to correctly place a capital city on the jigsaw board.<br/><br/>If they correctly place the capital city, they score 4 points.<br/>If they cannot place the capital city, they can put it to one side and score 0 points.<br/>If they incorrectly place the capital city, they lose 2 points.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/>The game was something of a rarity even when in production; it was expensive, and the general knowledge part of the game was an obvious afterthought. However, it is prized by collectors of vintage jigsaws, and has some curiosity value for the now-obsolete names used for countries on the map - for example Siam, Persia, Arabia and Ceylon. Definitely a remnant of the British Empire ;)<br/><br/>",

The game board features a map of Sweden on which the players move between cities and towns, by road, railroad, sea or plane. Each player starts with 4 randomly selected destination tiles which they may visit in any order. Upon placing a destination tile in the corresponding location, the face-down tile at that destination is drawn. Points are awarded for every destination visited, and province cards may award bonus points if you are lucky. The game ends when a player runs out of destination tiles, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

You will need the help of other politicians and the combined forces of the law to rid your region of its 10 major crimes. If you do it before time runs out you win.<br/><br/>For those on the wrong side of the law, life can be equally tough, fighting the law and trying to scratch a living. You may be a criminal seeking to expand your empire on the streets of South Africa. You need to work against the law keepers to keep crime out there before time runs out.<br/><br/>Each player is assigned a secret identity. Either a politician or a criminal. A starting hand of 6 cards is dealt to each player. There are 10 separate crime cards, each with a negative value. Theses are turned over one at a time until solved. Crimes are solved by placing positive cards from your hand on top of the negative crime card until the number reaches 0 or greater. However, their are negative valued cards as well that delay the process and 12 special cards with various functions. The criminals have ample opportunity to delay the process of crime solving.<br/><br/>If the 10 crime cards are solved before all the cards run out, the politicians win. Otherwise, the criminal (or criminals) wins.<br/><br/>",

In the tradition of our previous effort, Prussia Rising, Italy awakes is more a game than an historical<br/>simulation, but we still think that playing it could be a fun way to learn a little more about such an important period for the history of Italy, Europe<br/>and the world.<br/><br/>Contains:<br/>5 Pages of Rules<br/>63 x 29cm Map (in 3 parts)<br/>395 Counters<br/><br/>",

There is a deck of sea creatures that is shuffled, and cards are drawn and read to players who then put chips on matching animals. Instead of making a single line across the board horizontally, vertically or diagonally, the players want to make the letters S, E or A.

(Each player controls 6 of the 19 signs.)<br/><br/>The object of Haab is to move one of your 6 pieces into your opponent's Gate, which is located at the opposite end of the board, in between your opponent's Spawn Areas.<br/><br/>Players begin at either end of a board comprised of 23 circles. <br/>At the start of the game there are not any pieces on the board. Any pieces that a player wishes to use must be &quot;spawned&quot; in one of the Spawn Circles on that player's side of the board. <br/>Players may move the pieces that they already have on the board either by moving them into adjacent circles or by jumping over friendly pieces.<br/>Players also may use their pieces to capture their opponent's piecess by jumping over them.<br/><br/>Haab is a simple and fast paced abstract strategy game that is easy to learn and usually plays in under 20 minutes. It comes in a little cloth bag that also serves as the game board<br/>and it can be carried in any pocket that is big enough to hold a pack of gum.<br/><br/>Haab is a complete game that can be expanded by combining it with its sister games Junishi, 12 Moons, Zodiakos and Neteru.<br/>(source : the publisher)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Purple-skinned inhabitants of Gobland settled down wherever their short but nimble legs carried them. However, the heart of the nation beats in the capital of Big Gobba. It's here, on the Hill slopes, where the local chiefs dwelled. Upon discovering on the morrow of the recent festival that city's elite'd got lost somewhere, common goblins gave all other stuff up &mdash; it's high time to climb up the very top of the Hill, to the Cauldron, strike it and seize a better office.<br/><br/>Who doesn't want to become the Great Chief and rule the biggest Gobba in the world?! I'm asking you &mdash; who?<br/><br/>According to the classification, Gobba is a kind of &quot;resource gathering and winning on points&quot; game. Goblin players travel around the levels of the Hill and do their best to collect the required quantity of resources in order to win election for one of five offices.<br/><br/>Under the Hill a large Dump spreads out &mdash; upon getting here, players draw a card from the catch deck. They might get either a gizmo of some value and with some ability or a cataclysm impacting the overall situation in Big Gobba. As goblins are sly by nature, they can even hide a cataclysm that is unfavorable for them. However, when revealed, the deceit will be punished for sure.<br/><br/>The level above the Dump is occupied by Hovels. It's the place where goblins make hidings of their cards, so that their hand can be unloaded. However, it's a risky business, as there might come some enthusiasts for exploring others' hidings.<br/><br/>Yet higher the craftsmen level lies. Each cell up there has its own ability. For instance, in Hurler you can pay for flying to any other cell, in Booth you can play a shell game with another goblin, in Bazaar you can buy or sell a gizmo, and so on.<br/><br/>Above the craftsmen level, the elected elite of Big Gobba dwells. At first the area is empty, still whenever some goblin becomes elected &mdash; other players will have to pay for passage through the occupied dwelling.<br/><br/>The Cauldron is situated on the very top of the Hill. To announce an election, you have to climb up there and strike it. Whoever makes a higher bid, wins. Unless, to speak the truth, some evil-minded goblin throws a Sour Watermelon and scuttles the election. I bet they can.<br/><br/>Still, even if you succeeded in getting some office, it's too early to relax. The point is nobody in Big Gobba has ever abolished reelections. They do cost more but cunning competitors can hardly be frightened by a high price.<br/><br/>The victor is the goblin who gets more offices, and if there is an equal number &mdash; the goblin with senior offices. For instance, Trader stands higher than the Deputy of Hovels as the elections of the first one are paid with expensive gizmos, and for the Deputy whatever resources go.<br/><br/>During the game goblins can surprise each other in many ways: push down, stab with a knife, befuddle with mushrooms as well as use various sophisticated gizmos like Dusty Sack or Primus Stove.<br/><br/>Goblin-like elections may lead to a triumph or a scuffle but they will never make you weary! <br/> ",

Each player starts the game with six cards in hand, then you flip the top card of the deck until a vegetable card is revealed, reshuffling any revealed special cards back into the deck.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can play a vegetable card onto that discard pile as long as your card has at least one more ingredient of a type on the last card played. For example, if the most recently played card has 2 peppers, 4 tomatoes, and 1 piece of feta cheese, the next card played must contain at least 5 tomatoes, at least 3 peppers, or at least 2 pieces of feta cheese.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can play a special card on a second discard stack. If you play salt, then the next player must play salt themselves or skip their turn and do nothing more than &quot;mix the salad&quot;, that is, shuffle the played vegetable cards. If you play a mixing bowl, you flip the vegetable play requirement rule so that played veg cards must have fewer ingredients (but at least one) of a type on the most recently played card; another played mixing bowl cancels this rule. If you play a chef card, you can demand that everyone play vegetable cards that contain a certain ingredient (while following the current more-or-less rule) or you can prohibit an ingredient from being played; this rule lasts until the next special card is played.<br/><br/>If you can't play a card, you must draw a card.

Each piece is 4.75 inches long, yet every piece is unique in shape because it is split with a mallet and wedge in Maine USA rather than being sawed perfectly the same, by the zillions, in China.<br/>It is the unique shape created by this lovingly hand crafted production, and the random tapers and twists of each piece, that makes Tumblewood both beautiful to look at and hold, and more challenging to play. Each game requires a new approach, based on the pieces you have chosen to play. Stacking can go up high, or outward with counter balances and cantilevered sticks. The game can be played solo or with up to 8 or more players. It can be a co-operative game, where all try to work together to build a structure, or a competitive game, where each player tries to place a piece in such a way that it stays on the stack but make the next play more difficult. Tumblewood, in a hand made wooden box is a game that you will want to leave out to be seen and played by anyone who comes to visit. In fact, a pencil is included so that players can sign and date one of the pieces after playing. This creates a living game that becomes a record of gatherings and good fun.<br/><br/>Tumblewood Rules:<br/><br/>     Place two relatively matched pieces parallel on top of the Tumblewood box, then begin to build up.<br/>     Every piece above the foundation must touch at least two other pieces.<br/>     There is no wrong way to play. Go for tallest, widest, most compact, most creative.<br/>     Pieces may be divided equally, drawn out one at a time, or each player's piece chosen for them by the next player in rotation. Tumblewood is a creative game. Let your rules be a part of that creativity.<br/><br/><br/>Additional ways to play Tumblewood:<br/><br/>     Sabotage<br/>     Speed of Height<br/>     Leaning Tower<br/>     On The Radio<br/>     Trestle Bridge<br/>     Low Rider<br/><br/><br/>Hand carved &quot;Tumblewood Guardians&quot; and hand carved wooden Gaming Pieces and Score Markers now available.<br/><br/>",

The pieces, (same as Blokus) consist of a complete set of all polyominoes up to size 5.  The board is 20x20 (smaller in 2 or 3 player variants) with the six squares nearest each corner removed.  Play begins at a starting square for each player, and each players subsequent move must contact his previously placed pieces only at a diagonal points.   The game ends when no further pieces can be played.  The winner is the player who covered the most squares with his pieces.<br/><br/>Vis-a-vis Blokus, the differences are:<br/>(1) The corners are removed from the board so there are barely more squares on the board than pieces to be played.<br/>(2) There are no special scoring bonuses. The count of squares covered is the entire score.<br/>(3) In two player variants, A &quot;swap&quot; rule applies to the second move.

        "description": "A monopoly-like game in the entourage of a fantasy collectible card game &quot;Berserk&quot;. In addition to the standard property acquisition and collecting payment from opponents, players can fight monsters and develop their characters. Getting on certain cells of the field, players can start a battle with monsters and get treasures, which will improve their fighting skills.  The measure of fighting abilities is the level. Clashes between players are also possible: 2 players need just to be on the same sector. A mechanism of a fight is simple: the opponents roll a D6, add the number to their level value (that can be improved with artifacts) and the highest sum is the winner! In case of a defeat players don't die. The worst that can happen is the loss of a certain amount of money. Most powerful artifacts the player can receive for the victory over the dragon help you to make your rivals go broke, but do not play a critical role: if someone is doing bad he goes bankrupt anyway and prosperous player can afford to lose a couple of hundred.<br/><br/>",

Now each player can play action cards on two of the hunters and the monster card can attack the third one. Some action cards can take hunters out of the game while others can redirect them to other players (there is no defense against this). When all actions are resolved, the player with most hunter points has to keep the highest hunter card. When after a few rounds the number of hunter points a player has gathered exceeds 7, that player is out. The others continue untili only one monster is left.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of a game board divided into two sections by a boundary line straight down the middle, twelve fighter planes, four recon planes, sixteen hit or miss air defense tokens, four different colored dice and four separate sets of cards with twenty- five cards in each set. <br/>The dice are color coded for each squadron. When red and black squadrons move, the amount moved is determined by rolling the black and red dice together. When green and blue squadrons move, green and blue dice are rolled. The number appearing on each die must be moved by that color squadron, whether it is a fighter or a recon plane. No two planes of the same color may be moved in the same turn.<br/><br/>When a fighter has been shot down or destroyed on the ground, the victorious plane receives an ace sticker, to be placed by the victorious plane. Should the winning plane lands safely on its home base, the entire squadron then attains single ace status. The ace sticker is then placed in the corner of the home base's name square. Triple ace status is the highest. In the game you have Recons that destroy fighters on the ground, force fighters to scramble, and expose openings in the air defenses. The game has speed lanes which enable diagonal movement. Otherwise movement is restricted to horizontal or vertical directions.<br/><br/>",

Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll.

        "description": "Want a trick-taking cardgame that feels like an Internet flame war?  If so, check out Trollin'.<br/><br/>In Trollin', the object of the game is to try to take as many trick cards as possible, without taking the most cards of the poison suit.  If a player takes the most cards of the poison suit during a round/hand, they score no points for the round.<br/><br/>The game is playable with a reduced set of standard playing cards.  In the 2 player version (the game is playable for 1-6 players), players play with Ace, King, Queen, Jack, and 10 of all four suits.  The deck also uses 2 Jokers of different markings that are part of the Trump suit, which is Spades in the game, and are of greater value than the Ace, which is the highest in the trump (Cards go from high to low as Ace, King, Queen, Jack and 10).  Players are dealt 9 cards each and 4 cards are not used and are placed face down, and out of play, for the round.  As more players are added, more cards are added to the deck used.<br/><br/>The game also uses Hearts as the Poison suit.  During a round, a player who took the most Heart cards scores zero points, while their opponent scores 1 point for each trick they won.  In case of a tie for Hearts won in a trick, players score 1 point for each trick they won.<br/><br/>The game also features several optional rules, one of which is that a player can declare themselves Trollin' before the first trick is played.  If a player declares Trollin', they score as many points as the number of trick they won, and their opponent(s) score 0 for the round, IF they player managed to take all available Heart cards that could be won.  If the player declaring Trollin' fails to win all available Hearts, then they score zero points for a round and their opponent scores 1 point for each trick they won.<br/><br/>The game is played for a set number of rounds, or to a target score.  The name of the game comes from the inspiration of the game, that is Internet flame wars and people trolling in forums on the Internet.  The poison suit was discussed by the designer in Universal Mutators as a play mechanism.<br/><br/>",

When the dust settles, who will be declared the victor?<br/><br/>The game is divided into two phases: Draft and Duel. In the Draft phase, players take turns splitting up randomly drawn fantasy fighter cards of various races (Cyclops, Goblin, Human, Orc) into two pairs. Their opponent then gets to select which pair to take. The player who originally split the cards into pairs must take the remaining pair of fighters that was unselected by their opponent. This continues until both players have built a team of twelve fighters.<br/><br/>The game then moves on to the Duel phase in which the players fight for a randomly drawn coin by revealing one of the fighter cards that they drafted. Each fighter has a base combat value and may also have a special ability to help them in the duel. The players simultaneously select a Duel card from their hand and reveal at the same time, adding the value of the Duel card to their fighter's combat value. The fighter with the highest adjusted combat value wins the coin. The game continues in this way until all twelve of a player's fighters have fought one duel each. The player with the highest total value in coins wins.<br/><br/>",

When playing it is cramped and there is a lot of competition for few routes so uncompleted destination tickets are commonplace. With 5 players it can be very tough.<br/><br/>The board has little red aeroplanes (twin otters) instead of locomotives for 'ferry' routes and it has crevasses instead of tunnels but these are played the same way as tunnels.<br/><br/>The Amundsen Award (10 points) is given to the player with the longest route that includes the South Pole<br/><br/>Finally I include an alternative set of carriage cards made to represent the different vehicles we have here around site - obviously not necessary but fun for us here.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns trying to get to their destination (&quot;Villages&quot; card) as fast as possible by rolling two dice and only choosing one. When a player reaches her destination, she can now look at a clue card &quot;Indices&quot;. The player draws a new &quot;Villages&quot; card and continues moving. The phase ends when all &quot;Villages&quot; and &quot;Indices&quot; cards have been drawn.<br/><br/>Second Phase:<br/><br/>In this second phase, there is no specific destination. Each time a player stops her movement on another player's village, she looks at the &quot;Indices&quot; card found there. Players collect clues until they think they have enough data (there are 10 clues total in the game - with 9 clues collected, a player should know exactly where the treasure is hidden). Then, they try to move to where the treasure is located. If a player has found the right spot, she takes the treasure and the third phase begins.<br/><br/>Third phase:<br/><br/>The player who has found the treasure first must leave the Islands, carrying it, by boat or by plane. Other players will try to steal the treasure by landing on the same spot. The game ends when the treasure is out of the Islands...and the player who leaves with it wins!<br/><br/>",

They must ante some gold, then identify a safe and a number. If they're wrong, the owner of the safe keeps their ante; if they're right, then the safe owner hands over all the gold in that safe to the active player.

The rules are the same as Tank Hunter 2E, but with some parts removed to make for an easier to learn and more streamlined game.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player is dealt five tanks and one event card, and then you draft those to determine your starting hand. All tanks start out face down, but only face up tanks can attack or be attacked. You can flip your own tanks face up at any time, but you'll need to scout to force other players to flip up their tanks. Each turn you can attack, scout, or pass to draw an event card.<br/><br/>When you destroy a tank you collect it and it counts for points at the end of the game, with stronger tanks being worth more points. The game ends when all but one player run out of tanks or after the third Boco event card comes out, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Join the fight with this fast-paced card game for 1-2 players!<br/><br/>Based on the Gridcannon system, Eat the Rich sees players draw a single card each turn before placing it in or around a 9 card grid. If you draw a Noble (Jack, Queen, or King), place it around the perimeter of your grid (or an opponent's, if playing against friends). If you draw a numbered card, an Ace, or a Joker, place that card in one of the 9 spaces on your grid. Choose carefully, because you can only place a card on top of an equal or lesser-value card.<br/><br/>Line up high-value cards for clever combos and calculated attacks on the nobles, but don't get ahead of yourself. If you draw a card you can't play, you'll lose points. Destroy all twelve nobles to win the game. A simple, intuitive score system allows solitaire or competitive players to track their progress.<br/><br/>Includes 2 decks of traditional playing cards for classic games.

Don't worry, it'll be fun!<br/><br/>Choose one player to be the metronome, they'll be in charge of keeping the tempo and dealing the cards.<br/>The metronome chooses the cards according to their difficulty and shuffles them.<br/>The first times you play, we suggest starting with value 1 and 2 cards.<br/><br/>The metronome deals one card facing up to each player and starts marking a time signature (one, two, three, four) repeating it throughout the round. This will mark the rhythm to follow.<br/><br/>After the first time signature (one, two, three, four) the rest of the players will sing the note on their card at the same time.<br/><br/>It the player has a (crotchet) card, it will last the same time that a number of the 4/4 time signature. A quaver will make us sing the two syllables in that same time, a triplet quaver, three and a semiquaver, four.<br/><br/>In each time signature, before number three, the metronome will give a new card to one of the players. Those will have to switch between their notes from now on. For each number of the time signature, they will sing a note. A player shall never have two cards more than another.<br/><br/>If at any time, the metronome detects a mistake, stops the song shouting 'TEMPO!'. All the players keep their card with the highest score, except the one who made the mistake, who gives their highest card to the metronome.<br/><br/>If nobody makes any mistakes and all the players get to sing their 4 notes during a time signature, each one keeps their card with the highest score and the metronome doesn't keep any.<br/><br/>The remaining cards are shuffled again and the player on the right of the previous metronome becomes the new one.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the players have played as a metronome once. The one with more points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sasaki is a very fun game that is comparable to poker, blackjack, one card, and hula, and once you learn this game, you will not be able to get out of it. This climbing game for four players is said to be very popular in North Korea. It is named after one of the special combinations that can be played: Sasaki (사사끼) means 44A, that is two Fours and one Ace.<br/><br/>As in all climbing games the basic aim is to get rid of all one's cards before the other players. A player leads a card or a valid combination of cards and each player in turn must either beat the previous play with a higher or combination or pass. When no one can or wants to play higher, the played cards are set aside, and the person who played highest begins again.<br/><br/>Sasaki is a team game with temporary partnerships determined by the location of the two red 10's, so as well as playing their own cards, players try as far as they can to help their partners.<br/><br/>Sasaki is played with a 48-card deck made by removing all the Twos and Jokers from a standard international deck. The cards rank from high to low A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6-5-4-3. 1. 48 cards are dealt to 4 players, 12 each.<br/><br/>",

There&rsquo;s only one way to find out&hellip;<br/><br/>If you&rsquo;ve ever wondered whether or not you can weather a huge, destructive storm or total infrastructure collapse using nothing more than your wits, an axe, a paracord bracelet, a bottle of vodka and a dog, then this is the game for you.<br/><br/>The first main goal in Prepper is to build up a cupboard filled with everything you need to get through a crisis. While you&rsquo;re doing so, you advance around the board and pick up extra items and skills by testing your own prepping, survival and general knowledge and abilities, during a fun and challenging trivia round in which you&rsquo;ll answer questions and also interact with your surroundings and each other. By the end of the first round, you&rsquo;ll have a great prepper cupboard &ndash; packed with items that could range from a packet of painkillers to a domestic electricity generator. So far, so good. Right?<br/><br/>Wrong. Prepper is a game of two halves. And in the second half, things really go south. You see, once you&rsquo;ve tested your knowledge and built up your prep store as best you can, disaster strikes. What this disaster is, you don&rsquo;t know for sure. It could be anything from getting lost in the forest to a total infrastructure collapse. And it&rsquo;s happening to you, right now, and you need to do something about it.<br/><br/>A lot of people think they have the gumption needed to make it through a crisis. In Prepper, you get the chance to find out. And it&rsquo;s not just about having the right stuff in your cupboard. Far from it, in fact. It&rsquo;s also about having the skill to come up with creative solutions using only what you have at hand. It tests your ability to barter with your friends for the things you know you need right now &ndash; and which you&rsquo;re also going to have to convince them that they won&rsquo;t need any time soon. And, it measures your willingness to help others in their times of need &ndash; after all, one day you might need their help, too.<br/><br/>But more than anything else, it&rsquo;s about using your wits and your kit to get through tough situations &ndash; which might range from a cut thumb or a power cut to the roof literally being torn off your house &ndash; while still, somehow, keeping it all about the LOLs.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ve got what it takes to play Prepper. In fact, you were born ready. Now all you have to do is prove it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Then take a new card from the three already there and put it behind your deck.<br/><br/>As soon as the red end-of-round card is the top card in the deck, turn it according to its directional arrow and put it back behind your deck.<br/>After the fourth round, total up your points by adding up the values of all the cards (from the center of the table, your deck, and the cards already set aside), taking into account any bonuses you have unlocked.<br/><br/>For example, if you have upgraded both Chameleons twice, you get nine points instead of six.<br/><br/>VARIANT WITH RABBITS<br/><br/>Once you have familiarized yourself with the game, you can use the rabbit.<br/>Play two rounds, one without rabbit and one with rabbit using the same card order in your deck.

        "description": "The fishermen in the Chinese islands must catch six kinds of fish and bring those to market. Each fish requires its own kind of bait, so it's not as easy as it looks &mdash; not to mention that sharks can also take the bait! The weather might get worse, and you might run out of fuel or bait, so look to your fellow fishermen to ensure that together you can get those fish to market.<br/><br/>On a turn in Archipel, you navigate between the islands. If you're at a harbor, you can get fresh bait, fuel and other equipment, and you can also have a look at the weather. Weather tokens are placed on the game board, making sailing more difficult between storms. Fish are placed face down on the game board. To try to catch one, you flip it over to reveal it, but you must have the right bait on board. You'll possibly then need to sell the fish at market immediately as your boat can hold only so much fuel.<br/><br/>If all the villages are fed and all players return home, then the day was a success and they've won; if no more fish can be delivered, however, they'll have to try again another day.<br/><br/>",

Patolli was associated with gambling and players often wagered vast treasures on its outcome.<br/><br/>The game consists of throwing beans (dice) to bring tokens onto the board,  and move them towards an exit ramp at the other end.  Tokens are safe on some squares,  but mostly can be &quot;eaten&quot; if an opposing player lands on them.<br/><br/>The Kirk edition of the game includes a 49-page booklet on the history and background to the game.<br/><br/>",

U.S. Edition uses the same game play as the German-language 'Ausgerechnet!' series of games: Players deal three piles of 15 location cards from a deck of roughly 200 cards (naming cities and landmarks in the U.S. for this edition). They take one deck of 15 cards and put one location card on the direction board, pointing north, south, east and west.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws a location card &ndash; keeping the latitude and longitude on the back of the card secret from all players &ndash; then places the card next to the direction board, indicating how they think this location relates to the starting one. Is Honolulu west of San Francisco? Why sure, so place it by the west arrow. Location cards can be placed between cards already on the board.<br/><br/>After each location card is placed, any player can challenge the positioning of that card. That player reveals the back of the most recently placed card as well as one adjacent card. If the challenge was correct &ndash; and the card placed wrongly &ndash; the challenger wins a point chip from the placer and the card is removed; otherwise the challenger hands over a chip to that person.<br/><br/>After 15 cards are placed, there is an interim scoring in which all players secretly guess how many cards have been placed correctly. Guess correctly, and you score two chips; if no one is spot on, the closest guesser wins a chip.<br/><br/>After three rounds and the final interim scoring, the player with the most chips wins.<br/><br/>",

Their starships combine the awesome firepower of powerful particle accelerator beam energy weapons and devastating hyper-speed torpedoes for close combats and long-range raids by smaller ship-borne strike craft and the deadly mercenary shadowcraft. The four different species can ally in various patterns, resulting in different combinations in different games, or they can operate alone. Players determine when and where to seek battles; to launch distant raids or close with the enemy for battles within star systems or nebulae. The side that scores the most victory points by vaporizing enemy ships and winning star systems wins the game. This is an entertaining and fun card game where every playing is different. Playing time is one to three hours.<br/><br/>",

Each round has five tasks:<br/><br/>1)Players receive a certain number of action cards and use them to execute tasks (move pawns, remove crisis marks, move the ship, play dice to achieve the way of the science or use shapes to achieve the way of the consciousness).<br/><br/>2)Each region that has at least one crisis mark receive one more mark of the same color.<br/><br/>3)Destruction count: the stone of destruction is moved the number of regions that have a crisis. When the stone reachs 80, the players lose.<br/><br/>4)New Crisis: one player draws a certain number of region cards and add crisis marks to them.<br/><br/>5) Players receive new action cards.<br/><br/>The players win the game when there is no more crisis marks on the board.<br/><br/>",

On each lease, you must decide whether to go for shallow or deep wells --once a well has been drilled, even a dry hole, all future drilling must be done at the same depth, even if the lease changes hands.  The first few wells are Exploratory and have lesser chances of success; once a producing well has been drilled, further drilling is Developmental.  When you land on a player's lease, you buy its monthly oil production from him; landing on your own lease nets you double that amount (paid by the bank).  Payments also roll in every time you go around the board.<br/><br/>Random events are injected by Wildcat and Blowout cards.  The rest of the game falls in line with what its design is: a Monopoly clone.  Big box with lots of fairly nice bits, however.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately for everyone at the party, Houdini is a terrible cook. Each player must use their skills in magic to escape from the party without hurting Houdini's feelings.<br/><br/>Houdini's Poutini is a competitive game in which each player represents a group of five magicians. They must collect a combination of item cards with which they can perform magical escapes from the party. The Houdini card will mingle about the party, making it more difficult to escape the party without hurting his feelings. You must use your skills as a magician to get your entire group free from the party before time runs out and the poutine is served. When only one player remains or time runs out, anyone who was unable to escape must politely choke-down Houdini's ill-prepared Franken-dish.<br/><br/>A variation on rummy with a splash of Old Maid with lots of screwing over your opponents, Houdini's Poutini is a fast-paced and exciting card game for any with a strong mind and stronger stomach.<br/><br/>",

It takes a combination of luck and skill to win but mostly it takes a quick eye and fast reflexes.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to reach 20 points by matching the required numbers of the faceup goal card. Each player is assigned a player number (player 1, player 2, etc), chooses a color and takes the matching dice and pawn of that color. All the goal cards are shuffled and placed to the side. Everyone places their pawn on the start of the score track, and now you are now ready to play Lightning Dice!<br/><br/>",

You are all Knights in service of King Elvish. And like all Knights of the Kingdom you are madly in love with King Elvish&rsquo;s daughter. After much discussion, King Elvish and his daughter have agreed that the most valiant of her chosen suitors will become heir to the throne. The first Knight to present the Princess with the 3 Gifts of Gallantry she desires will win her favour. To acquire these gifts you must complete quests and obtain Laurels of Valor. Many Quests are impossible to complete alone. So, to demonstrate you are a born leader, you must hire and lead an adventuring party chosen from the most Motley Crew of the Kingdom. But, as a Knight of the Kingdom, you have worked your whole life in service and in turn been supported by the King. You have no gold to spare. In order to secure the necessary gold to pay your crew you must moonlight on OPQ (Other Patron&rsquo;s Quests). Use your gold and crew wisely to quickly complete as many quests as possible. Thereby securing your place as the true Rock Star Knight of the Kingdom and rightful heir to the throne.<br/><br/>In Hard Day&rsquo;s Knight each player holds 3 action dice, 1 patron die, some gold coins, and a hand of Motley Crew cards. Each round begins with the available Quests of the day posted at the center of the table. A round is a single hard day in a Knight&rsquo;s life attempting to complete as many Quests as possible. All players simultaneously roll their 4 dice at once. The patron die randomly determines the turn order for each round. To complete a Quest and receive the Laurels and daily income from that Quest card, players must match their action dice with the dice icons on the Quest cards. But don&rsquo;t be so quick to grab those Quest cards. Each player has a chance to hire Motley crew members and disrupt the dice on the table, or possibly the turn order, as you fight it out to be the first to complete the available Quests of the day.<br/><br/>",

Stanley Gibbons is a famous UK firm that sells postage stamps to collectors and published this game in the 70s to promote the hobby. There wasn't much to do in Britain in the 70s.<br/>The game has a board of a 6x6 grid of squares giving certain instructions, a deck of cards showing stamps which fall into various categories (Great Britain, USA, Animals, First Day Covers etc), and some playing cash. Players also have 4 markers to block the board to other players. Players are dealt 5 stamps to start and may swap one with the stamp dealer (banker). Then you roll 2 dice and choose which instruction on the board to follow. So if you roll a 2 and 4, you can use the instruction at 2/4 or at 4/2 on the grid. Players buy, swap, sell, auction, exhibit, damage or fake their stamps until they make a winning set collection.<br/>The stamps are nice.<br/><br/>",

While TKKG tries to find the treasure as soon as possible, the burglars try to stop them.<br/><br/>The game consists of a board, divided into several bigger and smaller areas, 8 cardboard figures (4 for each team), 33 cards and 2 dice, one normal, one showing the direction. In the beginning the burglar player chooses one of the fields on the board and writes it down: here the treasure is hidden. The aim of TKKG is to find it until the end of the game. In his/her turn the players can move on the board according to the dice result rolled. If the player lands on a &quot;star&quot;-field, (s)he is entitled to draw a card. The TKKG-player can ask a question, depending on the kind of question on the card, which the Burglar-player has to answer with yes or no. If the Burglar-player draws a card it is just put on the discard pile. Apart from questions regarding the whereabout of the treasure, there are also luck-cards, which allows the player to move a certain amount of steps on the board. If one player figure moves on a field, where an opponent stands, the opponent is taken hostage. If both players have hostages they can make an exchange, if the parties agree.<br/>The game ends when there are no cards left. The TKKG-player then has to choose a field, where he thinks the treasure is. If he is right he wins, otherwise the Burglar-player wins.<br/><br/>The game was later re-released under the name Piratenschatz with a new topic.<br/><br/>",

You summon creatures with Obsidian tokens (mana) and send them off to attack your opponent. Your opponent can defend with their creatures and gratuitous dice rolling ensues.<br/><br/>You must make your Strike Roll in order to hit. If you hit, you then roll for damage and apply it towards the enemy creature's Life Points. A pencil and paper is required since creatures have huge life totals, a Centaur Paladin has 53 life points for example. If the defending creatures survives, it can make a counter-attack by rolling even more dice. You continue until all attacking or defending creatures have been removed.<br/><br/>You can also cast Spells and equip your minions with Weapon tokens. Most creatures have cool special abilities which gives you plenty of options for customizing your deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grow: The Organic Building Game is a three-dimensional building game in which 2-4 players guide the constant growth of a tree and compete by blossoming flowers around it. The game features a simple-to-learn set of rules, ideal for younger children, while offering a deep level of strategic nuance for more seasoned players. The core mechanisms have been designed to lightly simulate the life of an actual tree, complete with seasons, flowering, and even bugs! Players are given the ability to grow the board, or tree, in any way they choose &ndash; resulting in a unique and interesting play experience every time. The game's length is completely adjustable and can be set up to last anywhere between 20-60 minutes.<br/><br/>Each player is represented by a flower color. The goal of the game is to have the most point-worthy flowers of your chosen color before the seasons &mdash; represented by stacks of leaves &mdash; run out. To do this, you perform one of three simple actions: place a bud which will blossom into a complete flower the next turn, place a leaf to help guide the tree's growth, or use a beetle to attack or protect flowers. Since flowers can connect only to leaves, and leaves can connect together to form chains, points are determined by how many leaves each flower is from the nearest branch. The game also features several unique, seasonal events that can be very beneficial or harmful to the tree's growth including locusts swarm, bee pollination, and wood rot!<br/><br/>Grow: The Organic Building Game was created by Tap Pribbenow, Chris Hassebrook and Kyle Bromley on the idea of blending traditional sculpture with tabletop gaming, while providing a fun way of incorporating plant ecology.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Long before Parker Brothers came out with its Billionaire game, a company in Minnesota called Happy Hour, Inc. came up with its own distinctive version of a Billionaire game. In this 1950's Howard Hanson design, the players race to move their marbles over a 3-D board in a dash to a Uranium Strike. Short cuts and pitfalls lie ahead to both aid and hinder the players in their race.

It is a game you can take anywhere and play time and time again to discover all the different nooks and crannies of the seven maps included.<br/><br/>It is a completely unique concept that promises to equally surprise and create headaches in equal measure. In this original game from Devir, you will unfold a map on the table, where you will start at the compass rose with the pointer you will find in the box, moving it along the labyrinth paths marked in white without ever lifting it from the map. You will have to open and close different parts of the map in search of the Impossible Triangle that will allow you to escape the maze. You can go under bridges, climb up ladders and run around in circles in the maze and in your own head until the exit finally leads you to&hellip; the next map!<br/><br/>In Mazescape: Labýrinthos you will go through three well defined territories: the docks, the graveyard, and the mountain. The first of the maps will help you to understand the most essential concepts of the game. Then. from there, they will become progressively more complicated until reaching the final challenge. They also have a bunch of secondary objectives that you can explore to get the very most out of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The mechanism involves using your cards matching them and plundering points from other players. For example the master thief card allows you to steal a pile of loot from another player, the pickpocket allows you to get a card from an opponents hand.

It's also very Monopoly like.<br/><br/>It's based on 20 movie productions. Players take turns moving around the board and have the option to buy various productions of older movies like Casablanca, High Noon, or A Streetcar Named Desire. There are title cards to represent ownership, with a list of three actors on them. If someone lands on your production they pay &quot;studio fees.&quot; The cost depends on the number of movie stars and awards you've collected for that movie.<br/><br/>There are several ways to acquire stars. The flimsy cards feature nice b&amp;w photos of actors such as Humphrey Bogart, Marilyn Monroe, and 58 others. Once you've completed a production, you are eligible to receive rewards. There are also Production &amp; Publicity cards much like Chance and Community Chest cards in Monoply. Bankruptcies occur if you have to pay more than you have. There are rules for three short-game variants, which are described as lasting about an hour. The regular game is said to take two to three hours.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Rex Reed, for a finishing touch.<br/><br/>",

If correct, the player can keep it, if not, the tile is returned.<br/>- or look at an armor tile. <br/>If a knight lands on a dice tile, the player can re-roll the corresponding die. On plain tiles, nothing happens. When a knight lands on a tile with another player's knight of the same size, that knight is sent back to the castle.<br/><br/>A player who moves a knight into the dragons' lair flips over one of the dragon tiles there. The back side of the dragon tiles shows a piece of armor. If the player has such an armor tile, s/he defeats the dragon and wins the game.

Players start with 5 random pieces, and take turns drawing one piece out of the box.  All pieces except the &quot;bat&quot; pieces have text written on the back, which is one of: &quot;Holy jigsaw, use this piece&quot;, &quot;Zowie! pick 2 more pieces&quot;, &quot;holy Batmobile, pick 1 more piece&quot;, &quot;Zap! Lose one piece&quot;, or &quot;Riddler strikes lose 2 pieces.&quot;  If a player draws one of the &quot;bat&quot; pieces he returns it to the box and takes a piece from any other player.<br/><br/>Players may keep duplicate pieces which are useful when directed to lose one or two pieces.  When drawing as directed by the text on the back of a piece, text is not read or followed on the pieces drawn, and if a &quot;bat&quot; piece is drawn this way it is returned until a non-bat piece is drawn.<br/><br/>The game is won when a player completes his 20 piece puzzle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the introduction to the rules:<br/><br/>Lovers Wild is a fun spoof of sexual morality today. As a player you have been invited to a wild party along with twelve naughty but nice characters. The object of play is for you to score as many &quot;seductions&quot; as possible.<br/><br/>The board is set up as a modest movie star type estate with various rooms. Bedroom, den, kitchen, etc, with an outside garden, pool, and entrance way. The objective of the game is to move various characters about from room to room, with the intent of gathering as many together in a room as possible. You must have the characters and the room card to score points. So as you move a character towards a room to have a group seduction with other character cards you have in hand, another player may have the same character card, and wishes this character to have a seduction with the players they are gathering in a different part/room of the estate. The more people you can gather in a room together the more points you score. There are optional rules that allow for gay seductions. Like Ticket to ride, the longer the track built the more points, in Lovers Wild the more characters in a room having a seduction, the more points. Multiples of characters must be as equal as possible, if 5 people in a room are having a seduction, 2 or 3 must be women, one woman and four men does not make an seduction or scoring hand. Fast moving game, lay your hand for points if you can, draw a card, move a character. The more players the more difficult larger seductions are. The board in nicely done, and character chits are humorous with a variety of people types, that fits well in with game, with names like Hands a Roaming, Lucy Love Lace, Dolly Pardon. This may be another game lost to the gaming world, where even the author could not put me onto a replacement copy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is played on a 7&times;7 grid,with an empty space in the middle.  Each player tries to place his checkers-like pieces (single or double) to form a square of any size with single pieces, while preventing his opponent from doing the same (blocking him with double pieces).  He does this while avoiding forming a square with his own double pieces.  The problem is that players compulsorily must place a double piece before playing any single piece!<br/><br/>",

In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color or number to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw cards from the draw pile until they are able to place a card. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit. Additionally, when playing their penultimate card from their hand, players must shout 'UNO' or face a forfeit of drawing two further cards.<br/><br/>These two football themed editions of UNO feature pictures of AFC and NFC stars on the cards.<br/><br/>WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: 'Champs Card' - When this card is played, the player who plays it selects another player to draw cards. That player must draw until he has drawn a number 4 card or seven cards total. The player playing the 'Champs Card' also selects the new color of play.<br/><br/>",

Seven means a strike out. Otherwise, check for the number on the back of the batter's card. The number corresponds to a fielding position and check that fielding position of the result. An outfield result is more likely to result in a hit than an infield result. any card used is replaced from the top card of the draw pile and the deck is reshuffled when depleted.

The object is to get matched sets of cards face value..<br/><br/>You begin by dealing four cards to the center, and equal stacks of four cards to each player.  Therefore, for three players there will be four face-up cards in the center, and each will have three stacks of 4 cards in front of them.  Players swap single cards with the center until a stack has 4 of the same face value.  They then flip the set over. Once all of their sets are flipped over the player says &quot;Stress&quot; to indicate they've won.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Wikipedia<br/>Seven Spades is a card game, apparently created by Johan W&auml;stlund in 2002. It's similar to Bullshit in that bluffing plays a key role; however the game is more fast-paced and, arguably, more intense.<br/><br/>While originally intended for two players (which is still the best way to play it), any number of people can play.<br/><br/>The gameplay is simple. A deck of 52 cards is used. The dealer shuffles the deck and places it on the table face down. The player to the left of the dealer is the first to go - he picks up a card from the deck, taking care not to show it to anyone. Now he can either discard it on the table, face up, or declare it a spade and put it in front of him, face down. If the latter happened, any other player can, but is not obliged to, challenge the first player by opening the card. If it's not a spade (i.e. the player attempted bluff), the first player is out of the game; if it is a spade, the second player is out. When only one player is left, he is declared the winner; with two people playing, the winner will always be determined on the first challenge.<br/><br/>The only other way to win is to collect a pre-determined number of spades - seven spades in the two-player version. The last (seventh) spade has to be a real spade, and is put face up, not face down. The person to do this is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Anyone can challenge a person who claims to have a spade, but only immediately after the card is put down. When the next player picks up a card, you are no longer allowed to challenge the previous player. Only the last card a player put down can be challenged, not the other ones.<br/><br/>When more than two people are playing, the number of spades to collect is adjusted so that it's always possible to win without bluffing. With a single 52-card deck, the number of spades to collect is:<br/><br/>for 2 people: 7<br/>for 3 people: 5<br/>for 4 people: 4<br/>for 5 people: 3<br/><br/>To increase the number of spades, or to allow more than five people to play, more than one deck can be used. The number of spades to collect is then multiplied by the number of decks used.<br/><br/>Optionally the following rule can be added when more than two people are playing: if a person challenges another player and proves him a liar, he gets a free turn. This promotes challenging and makes bluffing a bit more expensive.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to get close enough to nab the guest of honor&mdash;Desir&eacute; Delamorte, your dream girl&mdash;before the convention attendees discover that you're not just in costume. At game's end, one monster's going to get mobbed by con-goers. And one just might get away with the girl.<br/> Each deck contains 56 cards--that's four monster suits and a couple of extra-special cards. Each suit includes the monster itself, ten convention attendee cards, one Desir&eacute; Delamort card, and one Flash Armstrong card (her sports star boyfriend).<br/><br/>The idea is to capture as many Desir&eacute; Delamort cards as possible, while avoiding attendees of your own suit. You especially want to avoid the Flash Armstrong card; he riles up any suspicious attendees.<br/><br/>Fortunately, each monster has a special ability: Dracula's mesmeric gaze, Mummy's whirlwind, Werewolf's shape change, and Frankenstein's Monster's sheer strength, for example.<br/><br/>Add suits for monsters from the other decks in the series (Return of Monster Con, Son of Monster Con, and Monster Con: Cthulhu Pack), and you can play with as many as sixteen players! Each game also contains a pair of non-suited cards&mdash;from &quot;Sleeping in the Movie Room&quot; to &quot;Necronomicon&quot;&mdash;to add their own twists to play.<br/><br/>The 4 decks include the original with Dracula, the Mummy, Frankie, and the Werewolf; the Return of Monster Con with the Amorphous Blob, Alien Changeling, Invisible Man, and Swampy; Son of Monster Con with the Bride of Frankenstein, Undertaker, Phantom of the Opera, and Ghost of Room 13, and; the Cthulhu Pack with the Cthulhu Cultist, Innsmuoth Cousin, Pickman's Apprentice, and Nyarlathotep.<br/><br/>With each deck, you can play with three or four people ages 13 and up. Playing time is about 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Experior is a 2-player game with minimalist rules and an emergent complexity.<br/><br/>The game is about a combat in a fantasy world between a Human and an Elf. A character can perform three types of attack (sword, bow or magic attack), and each attack can be strong, causing great damages, or quick, causing damages more often. The damage intensity depends on the experience in that type of attack. A successful attack increases the experience of the fighter in that type of attack.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Players choose randomly who is the Human and who is the Elf.<br/><br/>In a common paper is written down the initial experiences for each type of attack and the initial number of wounds of both characters, as shown below. Another option is to print the board in the section files.<br/><br/>ELF <br/>Wounds: 0<br/>Sword: 2<br/>Bow: 3<br/>Magic: 2<br/><br/>HUMAN<br/>Wounds: 0<br/>Sword: 3<br/>Bow: 2<br/>Magic: 2<br/><br/>ATTACK: TYPES AND MODALITIES<br/>There are three types of attack: sword, bow and magic. For each of those there are two modalities: quick and strong.<br/><br/>So, each player has 6 cards for every possible attack: strong sword, quick sword, strong bow, quick bow, strong magic, quick magic.<br/><br/>You can print the custom cards in the images section. Another options is to use 6 cards, for each player, from an UNO game: two red cards with 1 and 3 values for quick sword and strong sword, two green cards with 1 and 3 values for quick bow and strong bow, two blue cards with 1 and 3 values for quick magic.<br/><br/>Winning order: sword beats bow, bow beats magic and magic beats swords.<br/><br/>TURN<br/>Each player places a face down card in the middle of the table. When both cards are placed, they are revealed.<br/><br/>&bull; With a successful quick attack, the opponent takes a number of wounds equal to the value of experience the winner has in that type of attack.<br/>&bull; With a successful strong attack, the opponent takes a number of wounds equal to the value of experience the winner has in that type of attack multiplied by 3.<br/><br/>After the opponent&rsquo;s damaging, the winner increases his experience in that type of attack by one.<br/><br/>The winning order (sword &gt; bow; bow &gt; magic; magic &gt; swords) determines who has done a successful attack. If both players chooses the same type of attack, the winner is who played a quick attack.<br/><br/>In case both players choose the same type of attack and the same modality, the player with less experience in that type of attack increases by one that type of attack and nobody takes any wounds. In case both players has the same amount of experience neither of them gain experience.<br/><br/>At the end of the turn, the two cards just played stay on the table, aside but in full view and unavailable for the next turn. At the end of the next turn, the new played cards will stay on the table, whereas the cards from the previous turn will return in the players&rsquo; hands.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>The game ends when one player reaches a number of wounds greater than or equal to 100. (The game is perfectly scalable, so players can choose any number of wounds as end condition.)<br/><br/>After that, players have to check who will get a bonus attack. Each player subtracts the value in his highest experience with the value his lowest experience. Who has the greater difference makes a number of wounds to the enemy equal to his highest experience multiplied by 3 (like a strong attack). If the differences are equal, whoever has less wounds gets the bonus attack..<br/><br/>The winner is the player with less wounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The object of Scrabble Twist is to form words using the five random letters displayed on the electronic game unit. Players tap in the letters and then twist the unit to bank each word. The more words a player can find, the higher his score. Scoring ranges from three points (for three-letter words) to seven points (for five-letter words).<br/><br/>The game features three difficulty levels and three different game modes. Party mode is a knockout round in which each player gets 15 seconds to bank a word before passing the game unit to the next player. Turbo mode offers a head-to-head challenge for two to eight players: Each player must bank words to score as many points as possible in 60 seconds. In Solo mode, a single player can practice his word-spotting skills in a 60-second time frame.<br/><br/>",

Note that it is divided into three key areas; the Location world map, the 3 hex battlefield and the recruitment areas.<br/><br/>Decide which country each player will use; Germany or Japan versus Russia or the United States. Place your 11 units on your player card. The card includes details on combat unit values in each Location type and a place to manage your recruited units.<br/><br/>Next, place the Early and Late war markers on the board. These color coded markers show your path to victory.  Place your Capital on its space.<br/><br/>Randomly place all the Location hexes on the world map. Now you can see the global map and plan the entire war.<br/><br/>Each player gets one Operations die. See how they have positive and negative numbers? These unique dice have unevenly distributed values, to keep great plans unreliable and ensure the fates of war are always at risk.<br/><br/>Now you are ready to play.<br/>After both players recruit units, Players take turns placing them on the battlefield. There is a lot of depth in this chess like exchange  &mdash;&nbsp;each unit performs differently in each Location &mdash; and you watch your enemy commit troops &mdash; so battle is a back and forth struggle to outwit your enemy to get the best dice odds.<br/><br/>Sum the combat values of your units, then roll to resolve combat. Place the Locations you conquer on your war markers to conquer the world.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win. The first is to force capitulation by filling your war markers with conquered locations before your opponent does.  The second is to unlock your enemy&rsquo;s capitol in the late war and take it in combat. This is the most difficult, and most rewarding way, to win.<br/> As the game progresses, Locations needed to complete the war or unlock your enemy&rsquo;s capitol become critical. With strategy and luck, your plans will lead to victory.<br/><br/>There are ways to feint, redeployment tactics and unique units for each country.

Whenever a player enters a new section with their pawn, they receive a field from the previous section. But be careful! Sometimes players block the coveted fields.

        "description": "Deep in the Amazon rainforest, a small people live on a rocky plateau, far from any civilisation.<br/><br/>Only a huge climbing vine - called Pi`i Pua by the inhabitants, the &quot;climbing flower&quot; - connects their village to the ground.<br/><br/>Every year, a group of young hunters is sent into the jungle to hunt. Who will be the first to climb the climbing vine that leads back to the village and thus receive the honour of asking for the hand of the chief's daughter?<br/><br/>The aim is to play the cards as well as possible in each round and to reach the home village as quickly as possible. In the process, however, attention must also be paid to other people, because everyone wants to climb the mighty climbing flower first.<br/><br/>How do you climb the vine?<br/><br/>Everyone gets a certain number of cards in their hand at the beginning. The rest become the draw pile. The starting card is placed in the middle of the table, the target card four edges above it.<br/><br/>When it is your turn, you choose from one of three possible actions:<br/><br/>When climbing, you place a card from your hand on edge against the vine and move up as many spaces as indicated on the card (or even less).<br/><br/>You can jump over your climbing opponents, but you must never be on the same field.<br/><br/>Make sure that at least one transition fits, otherwise you might have taken the wrong turn ...<br/><br/>If you decide with the second option that you would rather just explore the area, draw a card from the draw pile and move one space further.<br/><br/>As a last option, you can also cut the vine. To do this, you take a card from the draw pile into your hand. Of course, you only do this if there is no one on the card at the time. In addition, another card must not completely lose the connection.<br/><br/>If you are on a card with a flower during the game, you can perform two actions in your turn.<br/><br/>You can use a beetle card to replace a card that is already on the table, which then goes under the draw pile.<br/><br/>You cannot cross over beetle cards, so use them cleverly to block each other's way. By capping them, you can always use them somewhere else.<br/><br/>The first of you to reach one of the target fields has not only earned the respect of the entire tribe, but may also ask for the hand of the chief's daughter.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

As they gain experience and grow into larger and more capable dragons they will also face the challenge of slayers. With only 9 rounds to play it will be a tight race to see who can be most infamous Wyrm!<br/><br/>On your turn you will take actions that include search, eat, move, explore, raze, and fight. The explore action will allow you to draw new tiles to expand the play area. The search action will let you draw an event for a specific tile, which may be a fort, ruins, or a farm. These farms and forts may be razed for gold, or you can eat the livestock they produce to grow and gain experience.<br/><br/>Experience can be used to grow your dragon, from whelp to drake, and then to a mighty wyrm! You will also use experience to unlock and upgrade skills for your dragon. Each dragon has several unique skills that only they can use, no two dragons are exactly the same.<br/><br/>Each new round will start by introducing a new slayer to the board. The player who's turn it is to go first will control this slayer for the rest of the time it remains on the board. These slayers come in a variety of forms, from the simple bandit chieftain, to the mighty heroes of legend. Defeat these slayers and you will earn gold and experience, fail and you will have some of your actions crippled for a time.<br/><br/>Throughout the 9 rounds there will be new objectives introduced that will give players chances to earn more gold as they complete them. Whoever ultimately ends up with the most gold at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "INFLUENCE is a tactical card game where players attempt to gain the most Power. By playing Influence cards -- symbolizing military, political, and economic influence -- players conquer Castles and gain a base of Power. Maintaining control of these Castles grants additional Power, as well as influence over neighboring Castles!<br/> Each player has an identical set of ten Faction cards. With these, players will leverage Influence over Castles, alter the game board, and sabotage opponents&rsquo; strongholds. At the end of six Rounds, whoever has the most Power wins!<br/><br/>Castles are cards dealt face-down following the pattern on a Setup card -- these patterns have anywhere between 8 and 18 Castles. The Setup card also indicates the order in which the Castles are examined (determining who conquered the Castle).<br/><br/>Players have identical sets of six Influence cards, which are used (one per Round) to attempt to gain control of a Castle. Influence cards are played face-down in the Attack Phase, and revealed during the Conquer Phase. Conquering a Castles scores 1 Power, and maintaining control awards the amount of Power shown on the Castle card -- between 0 and 4 Power. With very few 3 and 4 Power Castles, these will be highly contested!<br/><br/>Conquered Castles have the additional benefit of providing bonus Influence against its immediate neighbors (up, down, left, right, and all four diagonals).<br/><br/>Additionally, players have four special cards:<br/>--Swap cards can be used to change the orientation of the Setup and Castle cards, and can be used to switch two Influence cards (players can only affect their own Influence cards, and Castles that they control).<br/>--The Saboteur card is used to prevent a Castle from using its Influence toward one neighboring Castle for one Round, and any player can play their Saboteur on ANY Castle.<br/>--The Delay card is played to move a player to the end of the Turn Order queue, granting the benefit of seeing where everyone else played before they decide where to play their Influence card. But beware! Everyone has a Delay card, and they can all be used on the same Round!<br/><br/>Power is scored every round and is cumulative. The player (or team!) with the most Power wins!<br/><br/>A note on Team games:<br/>Influence can be played free-for-all, but can also be played in teams, so long as the teams have an equal amount of Factions.<br/><br/>",

There are also cards in seven colors numbered 1 to 11 in each color (for a total of 77 such cards). The numbered colored cards also have zero, one or two roman numerals in their corner indices.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt four cards and the five roman numeral cards are placed face up in the center. In turn, players play one of their cards and then draw another one from the deck. When a card is played, the player must turn over one of the roman numeral cards corresponding to a roman numeral on the card just played - if there is no roman numeral, no card needs to be turned, if there are 2 roman numerals, the player can choose which one to turn. If the card has already been turned in a previous round, the player does not need to do anything further.<br/><br/>When only one out of the five roman numeral cards is left face up, the round ends and the cards that have been played are compared. The face up roman numeral card determines who has won the round - if it is the I, then the highest card wins; if the II, the second highest card wins; and so on. In cases of cards of the same number, the last played card of that number cancels the others already played. The player who played the winning card gets to keep all the cards played in that round. The game continues till there are no more cards left in the deck and a final round is played. The player who ends the game with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

Players take the part of paranoid villagers bent on accusing their townsmates of heinous acts of witchcraft while protecting themselves from similar accusations.  Accusations damage a villager's Reputation, and whenever a witch trial is called, the villager with the lowest Reputation hangs.  The player who called for the witch trial gets points for hanging his opponents' villagers, but beware--sometimes a trial will cause your own villager to be hanged, in which case you lose points.  Witch Hunt features frivolous accusations, valiant defenses, last-minute escapes from the gallows, and of course--the Village Cat.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player moves her knight in a straight line from its current location (crossing over any empty spaces) until it lands on a disc; if the space that the knight started from contained a disc, she picks up this disc and places it in her reserve. On a future turn, when this player would claim a disc of the same shape, she can either:<br/><br/><br/>    Pick up the disc and add it to her reserve, or<br/>    Take all the discs of this shape from her reserve and place them on the identically-shaped disc on the board, marking this column with a cylinder of her player color.<br/><br/><br/>On future turns, if a player would move onto a column marked with her cube, she can instead use this column as a bumper and bounce her knight in another direction, thereby giving her more options for movement. As soon as no player can take any more moves, the game ends and players tally their points. A column with two discs is worth 1 point, a column with three worth 3, a column with four worth 5, and so on. Whoever has the largest score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>By August 1950 the North Korean Army had overrun most of the Korean peninsula, and was advancing rapidly toward Pusan, the last open port in South Korea.<br/><br/>The US Army hastily formed a perimeter along the arcing Naktong River to stop &mdash; or at least delay &mdash; the final North Korean breakthrough. Every available US unit in Korea, including a Marine brigade, was thrown into the fight against three North Korean infantry divisions converging to crush what became known as the &quot;Naktong Bulge.&quot;<br/><br/>Naktong Bulge utilizes the new Fire &amp; Movement combat system that's designed so players can augment their units with &quot;support fire&quot; during the course of the turn. From fighter -bombers to artillery, units can receive support to engage enemy positions and formations, allowing combat to develop at all levels. A single recon company, for example &mdash; perhaps supported by howitzers &mdash; could be tasked to assault a lone enemy infantry battalion defending a mountain pass. As its attack gets underway, however, the recon company may find itself under fire from heavy artillery. More support will be necessary to take the pass, but assets are limited.<br/><br/>In Naktong Bulge the attritional design of the new Combat Results Table simulates the true nature of combat during the Korean War. Units are typically two-sided formations that can incur casualties, accurately replicating the realities of combat and the high losses sustained by both sides during the Korean War. Winning the battle is thus a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>",

It's enough that only one person reads the instruction beforehand and is able to bring the whole family into play in a minute.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>On your turn you draw a task tile requiring you to answer personal question or perform specific task. Tasks may involve additional components like Mood dice (for example you roll them and then tell what makes you feel the mood rolled). Play continues until the stack of tiles is exhausted. There is no winner per se.<br/><br/>Polish edition of Pytaki sold more than 10000 copies.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Gra PYTAKI jest przyjemną, prostą grą integracyjną dla całej rodziny. Dzięki intuicyjnej mechanice, w PYTAKI można zacząć grać właściwie od razu. To ważne, ponieważ wiele os&oacute;b nie lubi grać w gry ze względu na ich skomplikowane zasady. Wystarczy, że tylko jedna osoba przeczyta wcześniej instrukcję i jest w stanie wprowadzić w rozgrywkę całą rodzinę w ciągu minuty.<br/><br/>Rozgrywka polega na tym, że gracze siadają razem i po kolei (lub według innego z proponowanych kluczy) losują z woreczka &quot;PYTAKI&quot; czyli żetony, a następnie odpowiadają na wylosowane pytanie lub wykonują zadanie.<br/><br/>Pytania dotyczą r&oacute;żnych dziedzin życia a refleksja nad nimi i słuchanie odpowiedzi innych zapewniają graczom:<br/><br/>Lepsze poznanie się<br/>Rozw&oacute;j samoświadomości emocjonalnej<br/>Ćwiczenie komunikacji (słuchania, opowiadania)<br/>Kształtowanie postaw empatycznych<br/>Ćwiczenie cierpliwości<br/>Wspieranie nauki czytania najmłodszych<br/><br/>",

On fierce battlegrounds, brave warlords go out to tame and protect new domains from other would-be rulers. Each ambitious leader tests a lifetime of military training against other fierce warlords. Which commander will emerge victorious?<br/><br/>Come back to a time when mighty conquerors and warlords clash in great battles for land and honor. As a commander, you either lead your troops to heroic victory or suffer ignoble defeat! Conquer new territories and guard them from warlords striving to wrest away what you have earned. Each enemy, each battle, calls for a different strategy. Is brute military force enough to protect your domain? Will your opponent honor your offer of truce? Would a sudden cavalry raid or archery barrage pay off?<br/><br/>You can conquer the world! Choose your strategies wisely. Each victory will bring you one step closer to glory, but only one player will emerge triumphant. Do you build great cities to feed and protect your people, conquer land and the valuable resources it contains ot build mighty armies with which to defeat your foes? Failure means certain defeat at the hands of your enemies. The time is yours, fight on!<br/><br/>",

A roll of the giant 12-sided die determines the category you'll answer, or which special instruction you'll follow.<br/><br/>If you roll a category, you must decide how much you know in that field.  Is Sports your best category?  Then bet you'll win the maximum $100.  Not sure about Entertainment?  Then select $50.  Totally adrift in Science?  Then try the easiest $25.  Keep in mind you're trying to be the first player to win $750 in game chips.<br/><br/>Each side of each card has three clues, all leading to the same answer.  The clues range from difficult to easy, but all will be informative and fun.  There are 1,200 different answers and 3,600 clues in all, so the game can be played many times.<br/><br/>Special instructions on the die, such as Double or Their Choice, give the game real variety.  As an added twist, you can challenge your opponent if you think he or she has bet more than he or she knows.<br/><br/>",

It's a metal water bottle with the Munchkin Zombies cover art, painted in a beautiful color we're calling Gan-Green, with a carabiner to clip it to your belt, backpack, bandolier, or whatever else you have handy. And it has a rule...<br/><br/>Munchkin Zombies Water Bottle Rules<br/><br/>You may use this bottle in any game of Munchkin or its sequels. It may be used during any combat.<br/><br/>1. Show everyone this sheet so they can read the rules.<br/><br/>2. The Munchkin Zombies Water Bottle contains three swallows of Zombie Juice. Each swallow gives +1 in combat. You must actually drink one swallow for each +1 you want. You may drink it all for one combat, to get +3, or spread it out between combats. If you use the Munchkin Zombies Water Bottle in a game of Munchkin Zombies, you may drink all three swallows at once for a +4 bonus in any combat (individual swallows still only count for +1 each). You may give swallows of your Zombie Juice to other players, but be careful not to share Munchkin germs, or you might lose a level.<br/><br/>3. After each swallow, mark off one of the three boxes below. When all three boxes are marked off, the bottle is empty for game purposes, though you should still finish all the Zombie Juice, because staying hydrated is good for you.<br/><br/>",

Person, Place, Thing... is the quick thinking name game in which 2 or more players, 6 years and older, race to be the first to call out an acceptable answer to the category starting with a given letter. The game consists of a deck of 50 cards, and the object of the game is to finish with the most cards.<br/><br/>To begin play, the deck is shuffled thoroughly and placed face up in a pile on the playing surface. Designate a dealer who will read the categories and starting letters for the first round. The dealer reads aloud the category on the top card and then places it next to the deck to reveal the letter on the next card. Players race to call out an answer to the category starting with the letter revealed on the next card. The first player to call out an acceptable answer wins the first card. In the event of no answer or a tie, the card is set aside and the next winner of a card wins both cards. Play continues until all but the last card has been won. The player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>Note: This is not the same as Name That...! Person, Place, Thing..., even though it has the same name, and was published in the same year, by the same publisher.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quantum tic-tac-toe is a &quot;quantum generalization&quot; of tic-tac-toe in which the players' moves are &quot;superpositions&quot; of plays in the classical game. The game was invented by Allan Goff of Novatia Labs.<br/><br/>Quantum tic-tac-toe captures the three quantum phenomena discussed above by modifying one basic rule of classical tic-tac-toe: the number of marks allowed in each square. Additional rules specify when and how a set of marks &quot;collapses&quot; into classical moves.<br/><br/>On each move, the current player marks two squares with their letter (X or O), instead of one, and each letter (X or O) is subscripted with the number of the move (beginning counting with 1). The pair of marks are called spooky marks. (Because X always moves first, the subscripts on X are always odd and the subscripts on O are always even.)<br/><br/>For example, player 1's first move might be to place &quot;X1&quot; in both the upper left and lower right squares. The two squares thus marked are called entangled. During the game, there may be as many as eight spooky marks in a single square (if the square is entangled with all eight other squares).<br/><br/>The phenomenon of collapse is captured by specifying that a &quot;cyclic entanglement&quot; causes a &quot;measurement&quot;. A cyclic entanglement is a cycle in the entanglement graph; for example, if<br/><br/>square 1 is entangled via move X1 with square 4, and<br/>square 4 is entangled via move X3 with square 8, and<br/>square 8 is in turn entangled via move O4 with square 1,<br/>then these three squares form a cyclic entanglement. At the end of the turn on which the cyclic entanglement was created, the player whose turn it is not &mdash; that is, the player who did not create the cycle &mdash; chooses one of two ways to &quot;measure&quot; the cycle and thus cause all the entangled squares to &quot;collapse&quot; into classical tic-tac-toe moves. In the preceding example, since player 2 created the cycle, player 1 decides how to &quot;measure&quot; it. Player 1's two options are:<br/><br/>X1 collapses into square 1. This forces O4 to collapse into square 8 and X3 to collapse into square 4.<br/>X1 collapses into square 4. This forces X3 to collapse into square 8 and O4 to collapse into square 1.<br/>Any other chains of entanglements hanging off the cycle would also collapse at this time; for example, if square 1 were also entangled via O2 with square 5, then either measurement above would force O2 to collapse into square 5. (Note that it is impossible for two or more cyclic entanglements to be created in a single turn.)<br/><br/>When a move collapses into a single square, that square is permanently marked (in larger print) with the letter and subscript of the collapsed move &mdash; a classical mark. A square containing a classical mark is fixed for the rest of the game; no more spooky marks may be placed in it.<br/><br/>The first player to achieve a tic-tac-toe (three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) consisting entirely of classical marks is declared the winner. Since it is possible for a single measurement to collapse the entire board and give classical tic-tac-toes to both players simultaneously, the rules declare that the player whose tic-tac-toe has the lower maximum subscript earns one point, and the player whose tic-tac-toe has the higher maximum subscript earns only one-half point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Adult XXX Charades is played like a regular charade game for the most part. The goal is to be the first team to reach 10 points and be declared winner.<br/><br/>After the teams are formed, the first team (chosen by determining who most recently had sex) selects an actor who then announces which phrase he/she will act out (1-6). Then that actor draws a charade card from a deck of the provided cards (before being able to see what the phrases are!)<br/><br/>Each of the six phrases on the charade cards are marked with a single &quot;X&quot;, a double &quot;XX&quot; or a triple &quot;XXX&quot; which represents the potential difficulty of acting out/guessing that particular phrase.  A single &quot;X&quot; will be alloted one run through of the provided 60 second sand timer. The double &quot;XX&quot; will run through the sand timer one full time and then flip for a second run through.  The triple &quot;XXX&quot; designation shall allow the team to have a third sand timer run through. Regardless of which level &quot;X&quot; is assigned, the point alloted for a correctly guessed phrase is one.  The &quot;X&quot; designation simply allows for more or less time during the acting out/guessing phase and does not impact scoring.<br/><br/>The phrases often can be acted out using very common gestures, but some will be nearly impossible to portray without performing a lewd gesture (or ten.)<br/><br/>The actor may tell the team what level of difficulty &quot;X&quot; the phrase is but no other oral communication is allowed. Once the sandtimer is flipped, the acting and guessing commences.  The actor can not sing, talk, hum, mouth words, or give any other oral clues (besides naughty gestures) nor can the actor draw letters in the air.<br/><br/>When scoring points, the entire phrase must be correctly stated. &quot;Kissing&quot; would not be granted a point if the phrase was &quot;kissing under the mistletoe&quot;.<br/><br/>If the team correctly acts out and guesses the phrase before the sand timer(s) runs out, one point is marked on the included score sheet. Whether or not a team scores, once their timer runs out, the other team takes their turn.  This continues until one team has collected ten points and wins (Climaxes) the game.<br/><br/>Adult XXX Charades is a game of charades that is inappropriate for anyone under the age of 18.  The game does include sexually explicit references and innuendos, and may be offensive and inapropriate to some audiences.<br/><br/>Inside the box there are 100 charade cards with six phrases on each, 2 pencils, 60 second sand timer, score pad, instructions, and a charades signal sheet. The charade signal sheet is a helpful guide on how to act out common phrases/clues which can be used for any charade type game.<br/><br/>",

Then roll 2x all 4 dice of the same color to determine the strength of the island's watchtowers <br/>     How a day unfolds: At the beginning of each day, during your expedition, roll all 5 dice. The single colored dice will determine the direction of the watchtower's view. The 4 dice of the same color will be used for your movements and for the items collected during that day. Simply note your movement on the map and mark the areas you have searched. At the end of the day you should have enough resources (food and water). In some cases you will also need to find a warm place to shelter from the cold before nightfall. If not, your health will be diminished. <br/>     At the end of an expedition: this one can be a real success or an abject failure.

In Laws and Disorder, you play noblemen in a land ruled by ever-changing laws, and must bribe and bully the court into passing laws which benefit you, or harm your opponents.<br/><br/>Each player has one of six different professions which grant them certain abilities.  The shrewd Trader may buy additional assets, while the cunning Thief can steal from other players.  The deck contains words which players combine into laws that everyone must obey.  The Trader might make a law stating The Theif loses 2 cards when they use an ability, which should put a stop to the Thief's meddling - for awhile.<br/><br/>Things get interesting when the Doctor, Priest and Banker manipulate existing laws, and when the Thief gives up his life of crime to swap professions with another player.  The result is a game which is never the same twice, and will keep you looking for new ways to turn the situation to your advantage.<br/><br/>Laws and Disorder is best played with 4-6 players and ample table space, although it makes for a longer and more strategic game with 2-3 players.  Package includes deck plus rules.  You must provide pocket change, play money or peanuts to use as game currency - I leave this choice up to you.<br/><br/>Want to try before you buy?  You can also play Laws and Disorder in your browser on Whirled.com.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Players assume the roles of commanders of armies of fantastic races such as humans, vampires, dwarves, elves, etc., fighting among themselves and against the ultimate villains, the Dire-Dead, who are led by the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.<br/><br/>In DH:A, the 10-sided die is used to generate the random results to determine the outcome of battles, spells, and incidents.  Players build up armies of equivalent point values to fight each other.  The point value of a basic unit can be cheap, but can be increased by giving the unit better weapons, skills and spells.  Players are free to customize the standard units presented in the rulebook or create their own.  Rules also cover artillery, morale, chariots and elephants.<br/><br/>The battles are split into turns, which are further split into class movement phases (where increasingly more mobile units act ahead of slower ones).  During a turn, Class 1 units (the most mobile) act first.  The player who won the roll for initiative at the start of the turn enacts his or her orders for her Class 1 units before the opponent moves theirs.  They then repeat the same for their Class 2, Class 3, and lastly Class 4 units.  Individual figures can be grouped together with a leader in combat, supporting their leader in its fight and dying together with it if its roll fails against an opponent.<br/><br/>The winning conditions for a battle can include total destruction of the enemy, seizing an objective, or fleeing the battlefield after being surrounded.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Remember Scrimmage (by SPI)?  Well, Goal Line Stand is &quot;Scrimmage done right.&quot;  This is a game of tactical American football played on a hex grid field with each player represented by an individual counter.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the movement system, which is complex and, IMHO, realistic.  Player counters can occupy a hex center, a hex side or a hex corner (vertex).  Players spend movement points to move forward (straight or diagonally), backward (ditto), or sideways.  Players can be facing in 1 of 12 directions.  However, not all types of movement and facing are possible at all times - it depends upon where the counter is located (hex center, side or corner), and upon the position played and game situation.  Some movement bonuses are available.<br/><br/>Each player is rated for: mobility, power, blocking, tackling, rushing, running, passing &amp; pass receptions.  Substitutes are available at some positions.  A player may be in 1 of 2 stances: decelerated (as at the snap) or accelerated.  In an accelerated stance, a player can move much farther but has less maneuverability.<br/><br/>There are extensive rules governing illegal movement locations and player contact.  Blocking, tackling &amp; rushing are resolved (after contact) with percentage dice and a variety of die roll modifiers.  Movement after contact differs depending upon success or failure of the attempt.<br/><br/>Fake and real handoffs are possible.  Forward and lateral passing (fake and real) is handled in a realistic (and, again, complex) manner.  Passes may be lobs, lofts or bullets - each is handled in a different way for passing accuracy calculations and the chance of a deflection or interception.<br/><br/>Like Scrimmage, Goal Line Stand ignores the kicking game.  Fumbles and penalties are not accounted for.  Four learning scenarios are provided and, in my experience, are necessary to grasp this unique game system.<br/><br/>The game still suffers from a problem inherent in the concept - moving each player in 1/2 second intervals means it can easily take an evening to play 4 downs (between experienced players).  That said, it is an interesting play for true football fanatics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sandw&uuml;rmchen (Baby Sand Worms) was invented by Peter Lewe. The children get a box with real sand in it, complete with a plastic cover to keep the sand from running out. There are six spaces in the bottom of the box, into which the colorful baby sand worms are pressed until they are no longer visible. The box is then turned around several times, so that nobody can remember exactly where each color of worm is located any more! Each child then receives cards with baby worms of various colors, after which the game begins.<br/><br/>In turn order, each child tries to find a worm of the colour that matches their topmost card. This they do by carefully digging in the sand. What color appears? If it's the right one, then that child gets to try and reveal a worm that matches their next card. If it's the wrong one, then maybe he'll have better luck next time, once several worms have been discovered. The box is turned around at the end of each round, so players have to pay close attention to where the worms are! At the end of the game, once all cards have been assigned to their worms, each child gets to place a marker where they think a worm of the matching colour is located. Then comes the exciting ending: one child gets to rattle the box until all of the worms have poked their heads out of the sand.

Meatbot Massacre uses an innovative dice mechanic in which your choice of die-type determines your actions. The dice do the talking.<br/><br/>The core mechanic takes only minutes to learn, but the tactics get more intricate as your meatbot rips power-ups from enemies and devours them. In other words, you can make the game as simple or as complex as you want: When you've mastered it at its simplest, you can crank it up without learning new mechanics.<br/><br/>You can download the game for free at: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.danielsolis.com/meatbot/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.danielsolis.com/meatbot/</a><br/><br/>",

It's not simply a matter of serving cool culinary creations, there's a lot of hard work first.  The day starts with preparing the ingredients for today's menu.  Only then can you start cooking - and you'd better have everything ready by the time service starts.  And meet chef's standards.<br/><br/>In the game, players prepare ingredients according to the recipes for the dishes they're cooking.  They can take advantage of the ingredients other players prepare to get their dish ready quickly.  Then it's time for service and we find out who's got it right - and whose dishes are going in the bin.  Remember: if you can't take the heat, stay out of Hell's Kitchen!<br/><br/>Similar to Mamma Mia!, but now with a new theme and some new rules.<br/><br/>",

When a round of play begins, the first player draws a card and does whatever the card tells her to do: Touch something red in the room; recite her name backwards; place the card on her head, squat, then stand again without dropping the card, run around the table, and so on.<br/><br/>As soon as the player finishes her action, she passes the card deck to the next player. If the timer buzzes while you're holding the deck, you receive a lightning marker as penalty. Collect three lightning bolts, and you're struck down, losing the game while everyone else wins.<br/><br/>",

But challenge their mercenary pilots and they give up quickly and leave their machines.<br/><br/>We control 3 of the 6 sectors around their base, and we&rsquo;re moving in for the kill. As their Mechs retreat to defend their base, we will attempt to surround and capture them. Capture them if you can, destroy them if you must.<br/><br/>We are closer than we have ever been to a major victory against the Federation. It is all in your hands now. Don&rsquo;t fail us.<br/><br/>Game Overview<br/>Mech Capture is a solitaire print and play card game using 36 cards - no dice, cubes, or other components needed.<br/><br/>As enemy and friendly units appear on the battlefield, take charge of friendly units and deploy them in pairs to surround enemy Mechs, or in triplets to surround enemy Mechs, Transports, or Long Range Guns at their base.<br/><br/>A limited number of friendly units may be placed in your Reserves for future deployment. Deploy these units to match the enemy&rsquo;s displayed characteristic and number of pilots, to capture the Mech and gain its Victory Points. If you exceed their displayed characteristic, the Enemy unit is destroyed so that the Enemy (or you) cannot gain its Victory Points.<br/><br/>Winning the Game<br/>By game end have more Victory Points than the Enemy.

In this fun new card game, you handle the hives as your swarm of drones and queens is flipped and rearranged. Create two colonies before your opponents do.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Shuffle the deck of cards. Each player draws 16 cards face down from the deck. Then, each player makes two piles of 8 cards face down (4x2 grids). These are their two hives.<br/><br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn they will choose any card (except for their first turn where each player must choose their queen) and replace a face down card with the chosen card face up. The player will look at the card they chose and put it in the corresponding numbered location in the hive.<br/><br/>Players will continue to replace face down cards with each new card in their hand until you can no longer play any more cards.<br/><br/>If the overturned card is a queen, move it over to the other hive and start working on both hives at the same time. Once a queen is placed into a hive, she cannot be moved out. However, the queen is a wild card and can be moved around within the hive<br/><br/>When a player draws a card they can&rsquo;t play, they discard it into the discard pile and then their turn is over.<br/><br/>The winner is the first person to complete two hives. Each hive must have a queen and the rest of the numbers in order and all turned face up<br/><br/>",

There are 3 kinds of cards in the deck:<br/><br/>1) Pictures of signs, packages, menus, etc with one or more words obscured by questions marks and a notation of a non-English language.  Players will need to guess the word(s) obscured by the question marks.<br/><br/>2) Movie Titles in English with a notation of a country where that movie was translated into a non-direct translation. Players will need to provide their best guess of the translated movie title in that country. (For example, you might guess that Star Wars in China might be translated into &quot;Space Adventures&quot;.)<br/><br/>3) Idioms in a non-English language with a direct translation into English and a notation about the language the idiom comes from originally.  Players will need to guess what the idiom is actually about.<br/><br/>The game is played over 10 rounds. Each round, one player will act as the editor and select 1 random card, and then read the language / country and show the picture, read the movie title, or the translated idiom.<br/><br/>The editor writes down the actual answer and collects everyone's answer sheets and reviews them. If anyone gets the answer correct, they score points and the answer is not used. The editor then reads the remaining answers in random order.<br/><br/>Players vote on which answer they believe to be correct. Points are given for those who guess the correct answer and for those who got others to vote for their answer. The editor also grants a bonus point for their favorite answer - often a humorous answer.<br/><br/>The editor rotates to a new player each round and after 10 rounds, the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

There are 32 ports depicted on the map and the shipping lanes connecting the ports.  Also in the game are cargo charts - which show what goods are sold in each of the ports, port cards which list the ports and the price to buy the port, destination cards which list a port (some ports have more than 1 card depending on how busy that port was in real life), and cargo cards which represent each of the 9 types of goods in the game, and finally weather and pirate random event cards.<br/><br/>The game starts by all players drawing destination cards and a cargo card.  You then roll the dice and move your ship from your home port to a port that sells the trade good that you need which you then buy and transport to the destination port.  During the game all ports can be bought and if owned you have to pay a premium to the owner if you use that port.  You win by collecting 150,000.<br/><br/>",

The two white rings (&quot;lanes&quot;) allow movement limited only by the presence of other pieces. The three blue rings (&quot;moats&quot;) cannot be crossed in one go; you must stop on them. The lone exceptions are the four blue hexes on your side of the board --you may cross them freely, but your opponent cannot. The thirteen red hexes (&quot;gates&quot;), finally, are the game goals; you win by occupying five of these in a straight line. To enter a gate, you must start adjacent to it (except for the two gates adjacent to your base). Entering a gate (other than the two base ones) gives you a bonus move. Occupied gates are the only occupied spaces that can be jumped.<br/><br/>A hex is &quot;secured&quot; (the opponent cannot enter it) if surrounded by three or more of your pieces. Securing a hex captures any piece that happens to lie there (it is removed from the game and you get a bonus move). Finally, the fifth gate of any triangular set is secured if you occupy the first four. This is called &quot;triangulation&quot;.<br/><br/>The rulebook also supplies handicapping suggestions, optional rules for a more challenging game, and explains how to support team play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Against the Odds #59<br/><br/>Blind Faith: The Hussite Wars 1419-1434<br/><br/>In A.D. 1415, at the Council of Constance, Jan Hus and Jerome of Prague, two church reformers from Bohemia, were burnt at the stake for heresy. In the years that followed, outrage over the execution convulsed civil society in Bohemia, a fief of the Holy Roman Empire. Now, with Bohemia in rebellion as well as consumed by heresy, the Emperor Sigismund must wage war to both extirpate the heresy and secure his throne.<br/><br/>The Hussite player's forces are largely Bohemians (i.e. Czech) and others, who, inspired by the teachings of Jan Hus, supported the taking of Communion with both bread and wine, along with other reforms of the Roman Catholic Church. The Hussites are in turn divided into two to three factions: the Calixtenes (Moderates), the Taborites (Radicals), and a later splinter group called Orphans. Moderates preferred to reform the church, while radicals wanted more comprehensive reforms, not only of the church, but of the state and society. Some even rejected church and monarchy. The Imperial player controls those forces under the Emperor and King, Sigismund of Luxembourg. (Note: Sigismund was still only King of the Romans in 1420. Although he was not crowned emperor by the Pope until 1433, he was still the ruler of Germany, in a nominal sense anyway.) They support the execution of Hus and oppose the taking of Communion with both bread and wine. Royal Crusaders, including both the Catholic minority in Bohemia and the Kingdom of Hungary are also under the direct control of the Imperial player. Papal Crusaders from the Holy Roman Empire (i.e. Germany) are under the indirect control of the Imperial player.<br/><br/>This bitter and sustained struggle devastated large parts of the empire in a manner not seen again until another religious conflict, the Thirty Years War, took place in roughly the same regions. The Imperial player must destroy the heretics and retake Bohemia before the Pope is forced to make concessions in another church council. The Hussite player, led by the devout, blind and gifted military leader, Jan Zizka, must prevent this and try to begin a Reformation in Europe one hundred years early.<br/><br/>Designed by Jason Juneau, Blind Faith depicts a classic example of asymmetric warfare, granting both players many options in waging war. The resources and position of the Imperial side are pitted against the skill and morale of the Hussite side. Storming and besieging towns become part of players' strategies for loot and victory. This war was part of a larger sea change in warfare in Europe. Knights and peasants, artillery and threshing flails, clergy and laymen were thrown together in a war the signaled the demise of the feudal system and the universal church.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Instead, players roll the color-coded die, and answers a question matching the color rolled. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &quot;go for a wedge&quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a World of Dinosaurs is a territory and resource collection game for 2-4 players where you play simultaneously as Paleontologists in the present, and Dinosaurs in the past, on two separate boards. One board represents the island millions of years ago, and the other represents the island around the early 1900&rsquo;s <br/>Players defend their land from opposing teams, expand their territory, and explore the jungle for artifacts, all the while strategically fossilizing dinosaurs in areas of the island they control.<br/><br/>As they kill off these dinosaurs, players assemble their fossilized remains, and send them off to the museum to start attracting visitors. Sure, they may be narrowly avoiding certain death while they do so, but who isn&rsquo;t?<br/><br/>The better the dinosaurs, the more visitors walk into your museum. The dinosaurs can be assembled in any combination (for example Tyran-dactyl), to immediately attract visitors, or players can hold out to assemble matching parts for more points.<br/><br/>",

Some creative marketing on Ideal's part because the game is actually nothing more than a simple guessing game.  Each player or team has three pieces that they are trying to move to the center of the board.  On their turn, a player secretly chooses one of their pieces to move and holds the appropriately colored &quot;tactile&quot; for that piece in their closed hand.  Their opponent now tries to guess which color they are holding.  If their opponent guesses correctly, nothing happens.  If they guess incorrectly, the player gets to move that colored piece one step forward on the board.  When any two pieces get to the center of the board, the round is over and players score their position: +1 point for each piece in the middle of the board, -1 point for each piece left in the starting row.  First player to five points wins.<br/><br/>",

They also published a few games in other formats, one of which was the &quot;crackerbox&quot; format used for Mr. Who (Bid &amp; Bluff is the only other game published in this box type).<br/>The game, Mr. Who, is a somewhat unusual deduction game. There are 32 Suspect cards which show pictures like those on the outside of the box - the suspect is always the same man (Robert de Niro look-a-like) but could be wearing one of four different hats, sunglasses or not, and one of four differently-colored sweaters. There are also 32 Mr. Who cards which have written descriptions that match the Suspect cards, but with the characteristics in random order. In each round, one player is Mr. Who and picks a Mr. Who card - the other players are detectives and try to deduce which suspect he is. They play cards to the grid on the board to get information on the three items on the Mr. Who card. During this process Mr. Who commits more crimes and the reward money increases. After everyone has been Mr. Who once the player with the most money wins.<br/>The board is made of vinyl. A little metal car is used to track Mr. Who's progress. The reward marker is a generic plastic pawn.<br/><br/>",

Play, roll the dice and become 'Master of the Game'.<br/><br/>Aim of the Game:<br/>Try to reach the finish first with your swing-top bottle, pay the bill and win the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay synopsis With your swing-top bottle you travel from start to finish. Along the way you need to answer various questions or fulfill assignments. But watch out! Every ring brings you closer to the finish, but the questions and assignments become more difficult too. You go from one ring to the next via the doorman ar an open door. But... you don't reach the finish that easily. First you will need to make sure that you have paid your bill. With the beer voucher you won, you can pay the innkeeper. You win these vouchers by correctly answering the questions or fulfilling the assignments.<br/><br/>The Grolsch Master game is a promotional game from the Dutch brewery Grolsch, world famous (in the Netherlands) for it's swing-top bottles. The game is a party game that combines aspects of Trivial Pursuit, Pictionary, Charades etc.<br/><br/>The Trivia questions are divided into the categories Film, Beer, Sports and Various, each category containing 50 cards of 4 questions with increasing difficulty. The question you are asked depends on the ring you are in, the closer to the center, the more difficult the question should be. There are also 150 'the Pub' cards with 4 assignments that require you to draw, impersonate, act out or imitate persons, animals situations or even your thoughts on a particular matter (that you have written down beforehand). A sixth set of cards (30 brewery cards) are comparable to the 'Chance' cards of Monopoly.<br/><br/>You roll the die to determine the number of steps you have to take (you can decide whether you travel clockwise or counter clockwise), and depending on the square you land upon, you need to answer a question or carry out an assignment, you can get to the next ring or you get to draw a 'Brewery' (Chance) card. If you answer a question correctly, you get a beer voucher, otherwise you have to pay a beer voucher. If one of the other players guesses your assignment correctly, both get a beer voucher.<br/><br/>There a two possibilities to get to the next ring: via an open door, or via a doorman. The doorman requires payment in the form of beer vouchers. When you reach the final ring, you need to have enough beer vouchers to pay your bill. The first player reaching the inner circle wins the game.<br/><br/>",

You download a PDF containing rules and components, and print out what is required for play.<br/><br/>The Barons of Fyn is a card based strategy game in which competing players each try to become the most mighty Baron of Fyn.<br/><br/>The Great King Timothy has decided he will leave his kingdom, Fyn, and fight in the great crusades.  While he is gone, he trusts the nobility of the land will behave themselves, as good nobles should.  Little did King Timothy realize that his nobles were planning to use his leaving as a chance to conquer one another.  Knowing the King could come back at any time, the Barons of Fyn each fought to get as much power as possible, so that when the King did return, he would be forced to ally himself with the most powerful Baron.  As a result, the most powerful Baron would hold influence over the King, which could be used to punish the other Barons.<br/><br/>The Barons of Fyn starts with King Timothy leaving Fyn, and each player becoming one of the Barons who will fight it out for ultimate power.  By expanding his frontiers, each Baron will build new villages, towns, and cities, which are loyal only to him.  These villages, towns, and cities, then allow each Baron to build ever bigger armies with which the Baron can go conquering.  The standard game is played until King Timothy returns to Fyn, at which point, the player with the most victory points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to become the most mighty Baron of Fyn?<br/><br/>The game features a dynamic board that is generated as the players lay land cards; however, instead of a Kings-and-Things style board, this one combines some features of Illuminati, in the sense that each player's layout is independent of the others', except that when a group of cards is captured, the entire group is slid to your layout for hook-up, possibly discarding cards that can't fit (that would cause an overlap).<br/><br/>",

Each one, with their own agenda and their own way of possibly terrorizing the good people of the earth's mightiest city.

For years it has painted the picture of Alphas being with its editor and chief as the main sounding board. The truth is, some Alphas are bad. Some use their powers for their own personal gain, or &quot;just to see the world burn&quot; as they say. Some just want to keep to themselves or... save themselves.<br/><br/>Some though... some hear the calling.

This mode will appeal to families and game groups alike as it can be played cooperatively!<br/><br/>&quot;Head to Head&quot; Mode: This mode involves building a team of Alphas and squaring off against 1-3 other teams of Alphas in a random 1 of 6 different objective based missions! This mode will appeal to any who like playing tactical competitive games, and will be supported with organized play after its release.<br/><br/>&quot;One Shot&quot; Mode: These modes will be expansions in the future that feature smaller story arcs for players to play through. The first of which will be &quot;Alpha Hunters&quot;, a story where a shadow government group and it's giant mechanized creations hunt the Alphas, hurting cities and civilians in the process.

Each player then makes pairs from the cards that player holds, making either Matched Pairs or Linked Pairs.  Then each player, in turn, chooses one card at random from another player, in the hope of making more pairs. Players may choose to play one Horror or Cultist card at the end of their turn, after taking a card from another player, to cause an in-game effect.<br/><br/>Once all cards have been paired (other than The Great Old One), then all players add up their total scores based on the pairs they created. Matched Pairs are worth two points, Linked Pairs are worth one point; and having all four cards of a Linked set is worth 4 points, no matter what order you have the two Pairs in. Horror cards are worth one point during the scoring phase. The player who ends the game holding The Great Old One loses the game, all other players compare scores to determine the winner.<br/><br/>The Cultist card is a separate card which may be played instead of a Horror card at the end of a player's turn, and although it subtracts 1 point from the player's final score, if a player who has played the Cultist ends the game holding The Great Old One, they win the game!<br/><br/>",

You place the monster on one of the toilets on the game board, use the stick end of the plunger to turn the wheel, and (maybe) a hole opens in the game board underneath the toilet. Listen for the plop! If you hear it, you can use the plunger to pick up one of your face-down tokens. With luck, you reveal a full roll of toilet paper to clean up after yourself.

Just sit there like a picture of innocence kn owing you've gambled too much of the bank's money and hope that nobody has the nerve to challenge you.<br/><br/>Fourth in the Really Nasty games series, after Horse Racing, Golf and Motor Racing. Inspired by the financial crash of recent years. Straightforward rules and doesn't require any previous knowledge of banking.<br/><br/>The Monopoly-style board game casts players as the chief executives of fictitious banks with names like FullerCrookes and the RippOrf Banking Group. The aim is to invest the bank's cash as recklessly as possible without getting caught, and take home the biggest bonus. And, as a tribute to the financial crash of 2008 where Lloyds TSB and RBS were bailed out by taxpayers, players also have recourse to a 'public bailout' card. If a market collapses while they are heavily invested in it, the player is allowed to keep all their money.<br/><br/>",

The games included are:<br/><br/>&bull; Catch the Wind &mdash; Imagine playing in a park with the land divided into quadrants by wind cards. Over the course of the game, players place kite cards in different parts of the park (that is, the space between wind cards) to try to have the highest valued kite cards on top of the stack, but the first card played in a quadrant determines which cards can be played to that area subsequently. Designer Jason Kotarski describes this game as &quot;sort of a twist on trick-taking with players playing to multiple tricks at once over multiple rounds&quot;.<br/><br/>&bull; Ride the Skies &mdash; Wind cards fill the air (or rather the table as they're laid out in a grid), and players place their kite cards on top of them to ride the wind. The trick, though is that the card being placed must be equal to the sum of the card being played on and one of the adjacent cards in the grid. Once all of the wind cards are covered, players check each pile to see who played the most cards on each pile, awarding the wind card to that player.<br/><br/>&bull; Full of Air &mdash; Catch the most wind cards by participating in kite fights and outnumbering everyone else. To set up, a few wind cards are placed face up on the table, then players take turns placing a kite card at either end of the row, creating a sequence of 1-10 in each row. When a row is complete, whoever contributes the most claims the wind card from that row. Lightning cards let you zap another player's card and replace it with one of your own.<br/><br/>",

The therapists can request the &quot;lamp&quot; clue at the beginning of their turn, but this has a penalty: they lose the entire turn and they are forced from this moment to reveal their own &quot;dartboard&quot; clue if they fail a diagnosis.<br/><br/>There&acute;s also a special event called &quot;Therapy&quot; when a patient shouts &quot;THERAPY!! and all the patients should switch seats randomly between themselves (note that lots of pathologies take into account some sort of &quot;possitioning&quot; pattern, so i.e.: if you have to act and answer like the person at your right, this changes your answers after a Therapy! because there&acute;s another person at your right!), this event can happens when:<br/><br/>-The patient don&acute;t know the answer of a question.<br/>-The pathology says to do it or when it&acute;s impossible to follow it&acute;s indications.<br/>-A patient fails to following the pattern or indication of the pathology (in which case, if you detect a teammate patient &quot;fails&quot;, you should shout Therapy!!)<br/><br/>The goal is to discover the opponents pathology (the &quot;pattern&quot;) before they discovers yours!<br/><br/>A fast and funny game that can join in the same table every profile of board game player!!<br/>____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br/><br/>Crazy Therapy!! es un juego de cartas competitivo en el que dos equipos intercambian los roles de &quot;pacientes&quot; y &quot;terapeutas&quot;.<br/><br/>Cada equipo roba una carta del mazo (hay 48 en total), que representa una &quot;patolog&iacute;a&quot; (un patr&oacute;n de comportamiento que tendr&aacute;n que interpretar en su turno como &quot;pacientes&quot;)<br/>Hay muchos tipos de patolog&iacute;as divertidas, como trastornos de identidad donde tendr&eacute;is que &quot;suplantar&quot; a otro jugador espec&iacute;fico, trastornos de comportamiento, tics, &iexcl;&iexcl;y muchas mas demencias!!<br/><br/>En el turno de &quot;terapeutas&quot;, tendr&eacute;is que preguntar a los pacientes con preguntas cuya respuesta deba ser SI o NO. Cuando todos los terapeutas han preguntado, pueden intentar hacer un diagn&oacute;stico al final del turno para intentar ganar. Hay tambi&eacute;n dos pistas especiales en cada carta: &quot;bombilla&quot; y &quot;diana&quot;. Los terapeutas pueden solicitar la pista &quot;bombilla&quot; al inicio de su turno, pero esto tiene un precio: perder&aacute;n autom&aacute;ticamente el turno y adem&aacute;s, a partir de ese momento estar&aacute;n obligados a revelar su propia pista &quot;diana&quot; al equipo rival si fallan un diagn&oacute;stico.<br/><br/>Hay tambi&eacute;n un caso especial llamado &quot;Terapia&quot; donde un paciente grita &iexcl;&iexcl;TERAPIA!! y todos los pacientes deben intercambiarse aleatoriamente los asientos entre ellos mismos (ten en cuenta que muchas patolog&iacute;as juegan con alg&uacute;n factor de posicionamiento en su patr&oacute;n, as&iacute; que por ejemplo: si tienes que actuar y responder como la persona de tu derecha, &iexcl;esto cambia tus respuestas tras una Terapia! ya que ahora habr&aacute; otra persona a tu derecha!), este evento ocurre cuando:<br/><br/>-El paciente desconoce la respuesta a una pregunta.<br/>-Lo indica la patolog&iacute;a o es imposible cumplir su directriz.<br/>-El paciente falla al interpretar el patr&oacute;n o la indicaci&oacute;n de la patolog&iacute;a (en cuyo caso, si detectas un compa&ntilde;ero paciente &quot;fallar&quot; deber&aacute;s gritar &iexcl;Terapia!<br/><br/>&iexcl;El objetivo del juego es descifrar la patolog&iacute;a rival (el patr&oacute;n/funcionamiento) antes de que ellos descubran la vuestra!<br/><br/>&iexcl;&iexcl;Un juego r&aacute;pido y divertido que unir&aacute; en la misma mesa a todos los perfiles de jugadores de mesa!!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "All expansion cards available for the Machine of Death game, shipped in a separate box the same size as the main game box.<br/><br/>This includes 300 extra game cards, 100 Intel cards, and 230 Webcomics Pals cards.<br/><br/>(Does NOT include the extra blank card deck.)<br/><br/>Machine of Death: The Game of Creative Assassination is a storytelling game set in a world in which a machine can predict how a person will die with 100% accuracy with only a small blood sample. However, the machine delights in being vague and twisted. A card reading &quot;Old Age&quot; could mean you die in your sleep at age 120, or it could mean you're run over tomorrow by an elderly driver who forgot to take his pills today. Players of the game take the role of assassins, who must use the various tools at their disposal -- from storytelling to a slew of items available from specialty Black Market shops -- to create a situation in which a target is killed in a way in line with their Death Prediction. The Machine of Death Game uses this basic idea, of assassins working in a world were cause of death is known to create various game modes.<br/><br/>The General Gameplay of most modes works like this:<br/><br/>&bull; A target is assigned, and given certain details (including Death Prediction, and possibly extra details like a favourite food or crippling phobia).<br/>&bull; Players &ndash; assassins &ndash; are given Black Market Gift Cards. This is their inventory, what they have to use in order to accomplish their goal: killing the target.<br/>&bull; Players use the Gift Cards to devise a plan.<br/>&bull; The plan is greenlit, either by a Chief player, or via consensus, depending on game mode.<br/>&bull; The timer starts and the plan is put into action. This is represented by dice rolling to beat a &quot;difficulty score.&quot; An unlikely plan hinging on a single item may need to roll a 6 for that item, but a rock-solid intricate plan may need to only roll a 2 for all Black Market Gift Cards used.<br/>&bull; The plan is revised, in case of failure of one or more dice rolls. The details of this portion vary greatly from mode to mode, but involve either replacing Black Market Items, creating a new viable plan with the existing items, or calling in &quot;Specialists&quot;<br/>&bull; The target is either killed or escapes. Again, depending on mode, this is either the end of the round or the game.<br/><br/>Game Modes:<br/><br/><br/>    Head-to-Head Mode that's very similar to Cards Against Humanity or Apples to Apples. There's a judge (&quot;the Chief&quot;), who decides whose assassination plan is the best, and gives them a chance to try it out. Designed for 4+ playes.<br/>    Co-op Mode, where you players are a team of assassins, and have to come up with a plan together to kill targets that the group comes up with.<br/>    Co-op can be diced further: you can play individual rounds, or Mission Mode, where targets are predetermined and have different levels of difficulty. There's also the more strategic Chief Mode, where there's no timer, but the Chief can rate your plan's likelihood of success and let you take risks on whether it'll work or not.<br/>    Cutthroat Mode, where players can actually assassinate each other (should you want a more competitive version)<br/>    The Day Off Mode, which isn't about murder at all but rather draws upon your bevy of assassin skills to accomplish tasks like &quot;opening a stuck jam jar&quot; and &quot;transplanting a tulip bulb.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>",

Only one ship is allowed per space and each ship can move up to 3 spaces in any direction. You can then attack single enemy ships with 1 to 3 ships of your own at a time.

        "description": "Based on characters created by Roald Dahl, this game is billed as... The sneakiest, nastiest, dirtiest game in the world!<br/><br/>It is a simple card game, played over several rounds, in which players manage the cards in their hands in order to score as many points as possible each round.<br/><br/>Some of the cards have positive values and some of the cards have negative values.  There are also special cards marked 'upside down' that change the polarity of the cards in a players hand.<br/><br/>On his or her turn a player takes the top card from the draw deck, banks one set of cards if possible, and then passes one card to the left.  'Upside down' cards may not be passed to another player.<br/><br/>A set of three identical cards may be 'banked' during a players turn.  When one player has banked three sets of cards the round ends and the players score their hands.<br/><br/>All banked cards, whether plus or minus, score plus the face value of the set.  For example three +10 cards score 10 points and three -6 cards score 6 points.  Three 'upside down' cards may be banked for a score of 0.<br/><br/>All the cards in each players' hand are then added together to determine how many points are scored.  An 'Upside down' card in the players hand causes all + cards to become - and all - cards to become +.  If the player has more than one upside down card they cancel each other out.<br/><br/>Once the hands have been scored another round begins.<br/><br/>The first player to reach 100 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Cyborg - The Ultimate Adventure&quot; is a two-player wargame with both SF and Fantasy elements (&quot;After the atomic wars, magic filled the land...&quot;). One player controls Princess Gloriana and her entourage, who are trying to get from the North East corner of the map to the Holy City in the South West, where Gloriana's coronation will take place. Gloriana is escorted by cyborgs, Amazons, and Imperial Guardsmen, and is watched over from afar by the magic-using Guardians in the Holy City. The other player controls Aemulatio, the sister of the dead king, who is trying to capture and sacrifice Gloriana in order to seize the throne herself. Aemulatio fields mutants, gargoyles, and a pair of Necromancers (amusingly named Kcud and Nootrac) against Gloriana's forces.<br/><br/>Playing time is listed as &quot;2 - 3 hour(s)&quot; on the cover, but the rules declare there is no time limit. For Gloriana to win, she must reach the Holy City or totally rout Aemulatio's minions; for Aemulatio to win, her forces need only capture Gloriana (even if Aemulatio and her Necromancers are all dead, which would be a very Pyrrhic victory).<br/><br/>A six-sided die (not included) is required to resolve combat, and also to allow the Necromancers to cast one spell with random effects once per turn, and the Guardians to cast one spell each of &quot;Mind and Magic&quot; per turn.<br/><br/>The lurid cover art by R. P. &quot;Dick&quot; Winther, seems intent on evoking both Silver Age comics and 1940s pulp magazine covers, but falls far short of Excalibre's self-proclaimed &quot;Beautiful graphics and detail.&quot; A gargoyle is seizing a terrified Gloriana by the thigh, and appears to be wrestling her atop a rock... but closer inspection of the lower left corner of the cover reveals a second, smaller gargoyle in flight, and the space between it and Gloriana is filled with ant-sized fighting men. Presumably the main figures are meant to be aloft, though you'd never know it to look at them, making this cover one of the best examples of the classically &quot;bad&quot; game art of the 1970s.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kaminett is a hybrid backgammon/chinese checkers game. Each player has a set of 6 different size 3D pieces which are each 1x1xN (with N varying from 1 to 6). These all start upright on home squares. The object is to move them across the board.<br/><br/>Each turn, the player rolls a die and moves the corresponding piece. A piece moves by flipping it 90 degrees in a chosen direction. On the first move, this means laying the upright piece down so that it occupies N squares on the board.<br/><br/>The big catch is that you can only move to unoccupied squares.<br/><br/>",

Form influences starting placement and the movement of each horse. This statistic starts low but can be influenced by winning and losing races or through training. The pursuant training phase also allows the opportunity to collect cards that can influence form, aid in races and win money.<br/><br/>Before a race, players select which of their horses they wish to enter. Bets are placed on horses based on their form, starting position and taking into account any cards a player has to influence the race. During the race, players roll a die and compare the result to the horse's form to determine the movement value. Horses can move in and out of lanes based on the positions of other horses and any special cards that are used.<br/><br/>At the end of the race, bets are resolved and a predetermined purse is paid to the top 3 horses. Play proceeds with a second race followed by a third stage of auctioning, training and racing. At the completion of the third race, the player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A book containing three games:<br/><br/><br/>Pentagon<br/><br/>Pentagon is not a simulation in the formal sense of the word. The events in the game are intended to be illustrative and the decisions fictitious, woven from the progress of play. But by giving the players incentives both to compete and to cooperate, the game does simulate bureaucratic politics. And the content of bureaucratic politics is similar in tone and substance to real debates over military budgets. Pentagon shows how political factors influence the shape of budgets before the bureaucracy even gets down to decisions on weapons procurement and their merits.<br/><br/><br/>The R&amp;D Game: Congressional Chutes and Ladders<br/><br/>The R&amp;D Game is designed as a solitaire game. It is based on a decision-tree mechanism that leads the player through a set of alternative developments. This type of approach is sometimes called a &quot;scripted role&quot; model because the main emphasis is on broad decision choices rather than narrow selection of tactics. Given the broad choice, the decision tree itself generates much of the action, unlike a two-player or multi-player game in which action flows from the decisions of each of the players.<br/><br/><br/>The Last Days of Saigon<br/><br/>An introductory level wargame.  The goal of each player is to destroy the other player's forces, so the game does not follow the historical values.  The map is pretty basic, moderately large scale, 3-color with just basic terrain. Units are mostly Brigade-level units with a few regimental and batallion units thrown in. There is a mostly abstract representation of air, and naval units. [Note: This game was also published as 'Last Days At Saigon' in 'Bridge' magazine, Volume 4 #1 (11/75) bound-in, with b&amp;w components, as part of a 'Vietnam in Retrospect' issue.]<br/><br/>",

There must be 2 National League and 2 American League teams chosen.<br/><br/>The board is a representation of a baseball infield, with 7 spaces between each base. Each of the spaces has a logo of one of the (at the time) 28 Major League teams. They are grouped on each base path by the divisions at the time, i.e. the AL West is between home and first base, the NL East, between first and second, etc.<br/><br/>Players must advance around the diamond, stopping at each base. Once a player reaches home, he counts a &quot;win.&quot; The first player in each league to get 4 wins in the first round (the LCS) advances to the next round (the World Series). The first player to get 4 wins in the World Series wins the game.<br/><br/>Each base, including home plate, must be reached by exact count. To begin, the player spins a spinner with 8 spaces. One of the spaces allows the player to immediately go to first base and place his helmet there, while the others have a logo of a team that was, at the time, in the AL West. If the player lands on one of these, he puts his helmet on that team's space. In subsequent turns he rolls a die and advances his helmet towards the base, if he can do so. If the roll is higher than he can use, he stays where he is until his next turn.<br/><br/>Once he gets to a base, he repeats the process, starting by spinning the spinner for the new division he is traveling through.<br/><br/>",

Each player selects a criminal that he wants Baretta to catch and takes its matching Baretta Captures card. The deck of cards is then shuffled and a card is placed on all the outer ring spaces (except the corner Location spaces). The remaining cards are then dealt to the players who then shuffle in their Baretta Captures card to the cards they received to form their own draw pile.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the dice and moves Baretta in any one direction the amount rolled. If he lands on a space with a card, he turns the card over and follows the directions (usually moving him an extra amount of spaces or to a specific location). If he lands on an outer ring space without a card, the player draws the top card from his pile, looks at it, places it on the empty space, and marks it with a token of his color. Eventually players will start placing their Baretta Captures cards on the board and the first player to move Baretta onto his Capture card wins. So players are constantly trying to move the Baretta pawn away from cards marked by opponents and towards their own capture cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen! It&rsquo;s time for the Main Event of the Evening!&rdquo;<br/><br/>This is a very simple game, composed of a wrestling ring (printed on the inside of the cover) a few cardboard stand-up wrestlers to cut apart and the rulebook itself.<br/><br/>The game suggests several types of matches to play (1-on-1, 2-on-2, or free for all) but in reality any form of pro-wrestling you can think of could be played out with the game, and fairly quickly.<br/><br/>The action flows like this: at the beginning of the round, wrestlers roll for initiative, then in order each wrestler takes two actions, then the round ends.  Actions range from the mundane (move, stand-up, block, defend) to the slightly more interesting (grab/hold, flying leap, body slam, bouncing ram, cheap shot.) Rules for referees, pinning and foreign objects are also included for completeness.<br/><br/>The real meat of the game is in the campaigning.  Each match may take only 20 minutes to play out, but the game features a complete character creation system, as well as rules for continuing a character through a series of matches, with the usual stat-building, etc.  An interesting addition to this is popularity, which is increased by different things depending on whether your character is &ldquo;good&rdquo; or &ldquo;bad&rdquo; and as one could expect side-switching between matches is always a possibility&hellip; Characters can be further fleshed out by creating a manager for them as well as a signature move.<br/><br/>",

Players normally take one car each, or a cycle pack, picked randomly with a die roll on the encounter chart.  (Used for generating random traffic.)<br/><br/>Mechanics are a lot simpler than most games of this type - movement is composed of making lane changes and moving forward based on your speed.  Acceleration/deceleration and movement is plotted secretly, then simultaneously revealed - each turn each car will move one space forwards or sideways for each 10 MPH of speed, broken up into four phases. (Scale is 20 feet per square.)<br/><br/>Only one car (or two motorcycles) is allowed per square - if two cars try to move together they 'bump' and start rolling for critical damage.  Players can roll to make 'emergency' changes to their plotted movement (which is restricted, for example a 'right' move can never be changed into a 'left' move.)<br/><br/>Combat occurs at the end of every phase.  Drivers can fire one turret, (a group of weapons mounted in one of eight directions) gunners can fire two.  Any/all weapons can be fired each phase, which makes for a lot of shooting opportunities, which is good since weapons only fire in a straight line (front/back/right/left/diagonals.)<br/><br/>Scenarios include the basic duel, &quot;Rush Hour&quot; where there is a chance for random traffic to enter the highway (is what the on-ramp is used for) and a Death Race with 3 to 5 players racing sets of identical cars.<br/><br/>The game comes in a small box, closed with a folding flap like a satchel, complete with 3 highway boards (so you can put the rear board in front and keep driving) counters for the cars, lots of charts &amp; tables, car control sheets and a rule book.<br/><br/>",

The chickens are rolled like dice, and how they land determines the score. Scoring possibilities are: Chicken Out (laying on their sides) &ndash; 0 points; Beaker (beak and feet touching table) &ndash; 5; Twin Beaker (both chickens in Beaker position) &ndash; 10; Rear Ender (tail feathers and feet touching table) &ndash; 5; Twin Rear Ender (both chickens in Rear Ender position) &ndash; 10; Chicken Feet (standing on feet) &ndash; 10; Twin Chicken Feet (both chickens standing on feet) &ndash; 20; Head and Tails (beak and tail feathers touching table) &ndash; 15; Chicken Chit &ndash; (both chickens in Head and Tails position) automatically wins the game; Fowl (chickens are touching) &ndash; (minus 10); and Chicken Cacciatore &ndash; combination of any two scores, such as a Beaker and a Rear Ender.

Paths are different in length, and they always lead from one end of a game board (there are four of these) to the other. Players take turn rolling a die. On a roll of 1-5 they move forward accordingly. On a roll of 6, a player can either add a new board to the track (and choose the alignment of the board, to ensure his/her own path is short and those of others are long), turn a board around, or extend the game by taking the oldest board away and adding it to the end of the route. The first player to reach the edge of the forest is the winner.<br/><br/>",

There are 20 clues on each card, as well as a picture of one of four Disney characters: Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Pluto, or Goofy.<br/><br/>The players take turns being the Reader, who will read one of the clues to a player.  If that player guesses the Person, Place or Thing on the card, they get it.  If not, the Reader reads the next clue to the next player, and so on.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first to collect three cards with the same Disney character picture, or to collect three cards with all different pictures.  If you guess an answer with three or less clues given, you may randomly take a card from another player, add it to your hand, and then return a card of your choice to that player (which could be the card you just took).  This allows you to possibly better your hand.<br/><br/>Most of the cards are pretty easy for adults, but there are a few that are rather challenging.  With a little handicapping for the kids, this game could be played by the entire family.<br/><br/>",

How would Tom Watson fare against Jack Nicklaus in a repeat of their famous 1982 U.S. Open duel at Pebble Beach? Could Tiger repeat his incredible run of six consecutive victories over the 2000-2001 seasons? These and other questions wait to be answered.<br/><br/>Players are rated according to scoring average, top-10 finishes, and winning percentages. Tournaments are rated according to actual course statistics for a given year. Players can have hot and cold streaks. Weather can impact the tournament field at varying times. An action chart and a pair of dice determine a player&rsquo;s 18-hole score for a round, but on the final day, the top players can attempt a rally to catch-up or put away the field. You can complete a four-round tournament in as little as two hours. Replay complete seasons or create your own circuit. Play medal or match-play formats. Use the inter-year feature for all-time great tournaments.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Louise and the Wild Goats (Luise und die wilden Ziegen) is a tactical die-rolling game.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to drive your goats from the pasture into the barn making effective use of guard dog Louise. The way and number of spaces Louise moves on the board depends on the die roll. If you roll a 2, for example, Louise may jump over one or two goats Halma style. If Louise ends up on a space occupied by a goat, the goat moves one space straight on. The 12 barn spaces are worth victory points from 1 to 3. The game ends when the barn is fully filled with goats. The player with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Edition Spielbox No. 63<br/><br/>",

Battlestorm requires an attacker to &quot;Declare&quot; any melee combat BEFORE he moves. This way the opponent has the option of counter-attacking, fleeing or even attacking some other unit. Combat can fire off an exciting chain reaction that suddenly draws many units into the fray. These are called battlestorms and they often mean a battle can hinge on a few critical decisions that cause an explosion of carnage. It's not for the faint-hearted, Battlestorm is designed for a bold commander who wants to feel the rush of adrenaline as his troops become enmeshed in a tactical chess match with all the violence and pageantry of a medieval fantasy battle.<br/><br/>",

The winner is the player who can strike a balance between greed and conscience during the 100 years (60 minute) duration of the game.<br/><br/>Commodity cards are distributed evenly between the players - these indicate the jigsaw pieces on which this particular activity can take place and environmental (green) or industrial (gray) means by which the commodity can be exploited. Environmentally sound exploitation allows the jigsaw pieces to be placed green side up, and green tokens to be earned. Industrial exploitation requires the jigsaw piece to be gray side up, but generates income. Pieces can change from green to gray and vice versa dependent on how they are used.<br/><br/>Play involves taking a Fate Card, and following the instructions on it, rolling the die and moving. If the place moved to is on one of their commodity cards then it is ticked off - if not a question must be answered.<br/><br/>When 60 minutes (100 years) have passed, play ceases and the green jigsaw pieces are counted. If the required number of pieces (this is a group task and depends on the number of players) have not been turned to green, the Earth is lost and there is no winner ... If the required number have been achieved, the player that has accumulated 10 green tokens, 300 million and visited all the destinations listed on their commodity cards wins. In the event that this is not achieved, the winner is the player with the most Green Tokens, money and destinations visited, in that order.<br/><br/>",

The game is a faithful reproduction of the TV Show, except that the show mainly revolved around funny video fragments which are replaced by cards in the boxed game.<br/><br/>The quizmaster reads the two players - or two teams of players - a question from the cards. Depending on their answers, the players get to drive a nail (=&quot;kopspijker&quot;) in a piece of wood. Winner is the player with their nail sticking out the least after a set number of rounds.<br/><br/>The game's wooden box includes everything needed: question cards, hammer, nails and plank (no band-aids though). Sore thumbs guaranteed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Asgard has fallen. As foretold in the Ragnarok Prophesy, the cataclysmic battle between the Norse Gods of Valhalla and their enemies has been fought. Odin, Thor, and all the others have been defeated, and their spirits now dwell in Niffelheim. Their most powerful enemies perished as well - Fenris the Wolf, the Midgard Serpent, and the greatest of the Frost Giants. Now their names are evoked only as empty curses. But what follows Ragnarok? Who rises from the ashes and anarchy left by the fall of the Norse gods? DWARF WARS is a game of conquest and warfare between good and evil in a ravaged world. The battle rules are very easy to learn and fast to play, but they capture all of the demands of command, the importance of the skill and experience of warriors, the advantages and disadvantages of diverse weapons, and the terrible uncertainty of battle. The additional sections of the rules add to the game without changing its basic rules, incorporating magic and the mythical creatures of a fantasy world rich in history and lore.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An early game of rummy with words.  The deck has 78 letter cards -- the entire alphabet in each color (red, green, &amp; blue).  Each letter has a point value from 1 to 5, commoner letters with higher values.  Deal 7 cards each for 6 or less players, 6 each for 7 players, 5 for 8 players, and turn up the top of the draw pile to start the discard pile.<br/><br/>In a turn of the Standard game, a player draws 1 from either pile, plays words to the table, and discards 1.  Each word must have at least 2 letters, and all must be of the same color, unless it has more than 1 of a certain letter.  If the word has more than one repeated letter (e.g. &quot;refer&quot;) the second 'e' and 'r' most both be of the same color.  Words on the table may not be added to or otherwise changed.<br/><br/>The hand ends when a player empties his hand, or when the draw pile runs out.  Each player scores: for words on the table, the length of the word squared (e.g. 5 letters =&gt; 25 points); for words in the hand, the simple length of the word (5 letters =&gt; 5 points); and for each card in hand, the value of the card is subtracted.  The game is won at 150 points.<br/><br/>The Advanced game has a yahtzee-like scoring pad.  There is a row for each word length from 2 to 8, and two scoring columns.  The first word scored for each length is written in the Primary column; and further words for that length are simply tallied in the Secondary column.  After a chosen length of time or number of hands, the player with the highest Primary total wins; ties are broken by the Secondary total.<br/><br/>Finally, the Inverse game only scores penalties: at the end of the hand, players total the points left in their hands.  After a chosen number of deals, the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

There are two 13x19&quot; maps with over 200 counters. There are two rules books - standard rules that are 5 pages and Messines:1917 rules that run another 4 pages.  There are two scenarios - first day and campaign. Artillery is the centerpiece of the game with four different types of bombardment (saturation,  standard, intermittent, and gas) possible.  There are three types of guns - field, medium, and heavy with each best suited to certain roles.  For Messines the addition of mines makes initial set up and play a real chess match.  The key to victory is correct deployment and effective use of reserves.  For the Allies, one of the key decisions is how much to bombard.  It is very effective but it also destroys the drainage systems of the area and leads to a quagmire that with eliminated possibilities.  For the German player, commitment of reserves is the key.  He has to guess correctly at the main points of attack by the British player before they have sufficiently evolved to make the attack plan apparent.<br/><br/>",

Through the play of cards you try an attempt to climb the mountain choosing a route which best suits the resources you have available to you. You may choose one of five routes to climb. Each has its only difficulties and requirements.<br/><br/>Through the use of card play you gradually climb the mountain choosing the best route available to you, surrendering cards as you climb. There is always the possibility of disaster as dictated by possible avalanches which can force you to start all over again from the base camp. The avalanche possibility is dictated by a nice system of die rolls. Roll 2D6, first is the route that is effected from 1 to 5, the second is the increase in avalanche likelihood. Each route has an avalanche dial on the board as the points amass on this dial the likelihood of an avalanche gets nearer. If the dial clicks around to the 12 position an avalanche occurs and it will knock climbers back to base camp who are caught on that route.<br/><br/>Interesting game of tension and resource management with a fair amount of luck thrown in. Nice looking board and cool mountain climbers. Some strategic play possibilities.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>8 climbers<br/>Equipment cards<br/>Weather Protection cards<br/>2d6<br/><br/>",

The trominoes are lettered A, B, and C.<br/><br/>After the first four trominoes are played using a different set of rules, players have to play in the letter sequence (A, B, C, then back to A), and also play so that no trominoes with the same letter touch each other. When a piece is played it must touch at least one piece of the other color and must have at least two squares touching other pieces.<br/><br/>The object is to completely surround one or more opposing pieces with your pieces and/or surrounded empty space. If all pieces are played without this happening players move pieces on the edge of the playing area using the same rules.<br/><br/>If players play a series of games, the winner of a game scores a point each surrounded piece.<br/><br/>",

Infantry and special-ops dominoes are used in the fight to defeat the enemy in the domino warfare action.<br/><br/>Game play is similar to traditional domino games like All-Fives. The player with the highest double places it on the table facing horizontally. This becomes a separator that divides each player's base. On their turn, each player can place a domino only on their side of the divider, unless the other player runs out of viable plays, in which case their base becomes open to invasion by the opposing player.<br/><br/>Dominoes with blank ends have unique special-ops graphics printed on them. When special-ops dominoes are played, one of several events can occur, such as swapping domino tiles with the opposing player, or engaging in domino &quot;combat.&quot;<br/><br/>The first player to shed all their dominoes wins the round. Points are tallied by adding up the number of pips from the dominoes still remaining in the loser's hand. The first player to accumulate 100 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Share And Share Alike is a moderately complex economic simulation game for 4 players, a Poker deck, and 4 Icehouse stashes (or 60 stackable tokens, like poker chips or checkers).  The game starts with five companies, each with no investments.  Each player starts with no shares in any companies.  During the game you gain shares in companies (some of your choice and some at random) and you invest in companies by playing cards from your hand.  The game ends after 15 rounds of play.  The company with the most investment at the end of the game comes in first, and so on down. First place gets 1000 points. Second place gets 800 points. Third place gets 600 points. Fourth place gets 400 points. Fifth place gets 200 points. Dividing the number of points for each company by the total number of shares claimed for each company provides the share value for each share of that company. The player with the most value in shares wins the game.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/play/220/share-share-alike\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/play/220/share-share-alike</a><br/><br/>",

This new version has a slightly different set of rules and also provides more variants.<br/><br/>Each player gets a Goal Card showing a pattern of 5 hexagons (among the 32 provided in the game). Everyone shares the very same 25 hexagons to build their pattern: 8 blue, 8 red, 8 yellow and 1 black. You try to be the first one to realize your pattern. To win, you must include in your pattern the black hexagon, and the 4 others must be of the same color (either all blue, all red or all yellow).<br/><br/>Whenever you get closer to your own goal, you might actually be helping your opponent as well. You cannot just focus on your own pattern, you must also try to decipher your opponent's and prevent it from being realized.<br/><br/>This game is freely accessible on the author's website.<br/><br/>",

In the Indian epic - the Ramayana, Dasharatha, Rama's father is forced by an old promise to send Rama, his eldest son away to the forest for fourteen years. Rama is accompanied by his wife Sita and brother, Lakshmana. Vanavaas - the Adventures in the Forest follows their experiences until the kidnapping of Sita. In the second game, the Search for Sita, you follow the adventures of Rama and Lakshmana as they search for Sita and seek the help of the vanaras or monkeys. Hanuman finally finds Sita in Lanka where she is a prisoner of the demon king - Ravana. Rama and Lakshmana, along with their new friends Sugriva and Hanuman decide that the only option is to fight a war with Ravana and rescue Sita. It was a mighty battle fought between the rakshasas led by Ravana and the vanara army led by Rama. This game brings you face to face with some of the unforgettable characters like Kumbakarna, Indrajit and Jambavan. It also introduces you to many of the special powers that gave both sides the numerous advantages. Rama is invincible and represents the Power of Good. However, in the epic he is told to seek the assistance of the vanaras led by Sugriva. It is this that led to the concept of the game. The game is based on C. Rajagopalachari's Ramayana in English.

If it finds the first token must then catch the blue box and keep it the same way ahead in case corresponds to their character, or discard it in the yellow box otherwise.<br/><br/>The game continues, until it is emptied a red box or blue box.<br/>Then the player who drew the last coin, discovered the chips has previously collected (if it has, otherwise you go to the next player) and becomes the examination. The other at this point watching the chips and consulting support control, they must understand what the character looked, and as said before, who first guesses wins the game. If anyone guess, the player who collected more tokens, and in this case is virtually impossible to win the examiner, because even if he had collected a lot of chips, surely the many tokens collected would go to &quot;unmask&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Comes with 6 books of question with the following categories:<br/><br/>     Sports/Recreation<br/>     Natural Science<br/>     Social Science<br/>     TV/Movies/Show Business<br/>     Art<br/>     Trivia<br/><br/><br/>You roll the dice and move in a circular board. The square you are in determines the category. To choose the question you have to roll 3 dice in order, so if for example you rolled a 5 then a 2 and finally a 3, then you have to answer question number 523.<br/>Each number of question comes with 2 questions actually, one more difficult than the other, so the game can be played by parents and children.<br/>The first player to answer correctly one answer of each category when standing in a star square wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Raid in Mogadishu on 3 October 1993 was the seventh in a series of raids mounted by US SOF (Special Operations Forces) Task Force Ranger (TFR). It was an attempt to immediately and dramatically seize the leadership of General Mohammad Farrah Aideed&rsquo;s Habr Gidr, which was in conflict with UN forces being supported by the US. What was planned as a lightning raid soon escalated into a decisive, bitter and costly two-day battle. The aftermath led to the withdrawal of US and UN forces in Somalia and the consolidation of Aideed and Habr Gidr power. It was the most intense fighting the US military had seen since Vietnam. The course of the events has become familiar through the film based on Mark Bowden&rsquo;s Black Hawk Down. For the Somalis the battle is remembered as &ldquo;Malinki Ranger&rdquo; which translates into English as &ldquo;Day of the Ranger&rdquo;. As has usually been the case Post Cold-War the fighting in Somalia was not about ideology but about Aideed and his Habr Gidr faction. In a war about an individual, seizure raids by SOF become strategic operations. Fittingly, it was also a conflict that pitted Aideed&rsquo;s strategy of attrition against SOF tactics of raiding.<br/><br/>This is a very simple two player simulation of the October 3, 1993 firefight between Task Force Ranger and the Habr Gidr Clan in Mogadishu, Somalia. Each player controls either Task Force Ranger or the Habr Gidr Clan. The use of the title Day of the Rangers refers to the Somali name for the fight-&rsquo;Malinki Ranger.&rsquo; The object of the game is to amass as many victory points as possible, the winner gains the most points, however the victory conditions set up to provide a balanced scenario outcome.<br/><br/>Game Files Direct Download: LINK<br/><br/>",

The number of cards you start with depends on the number of players. Every turn you try to play a card. If you cannot, you must draw a card instead. Once a player goes out, a hand ends and the remaining players must add up the point values left in their hands.<br/><br/>After 6 rounds, the player with the lowest score is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;The Japanese hoped that World War II would make them the masters of the Pacific. They recognized the industrial might of the United States. Their strategy was therefore to destroy the American Navy with a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The plan almost worked. The Japanese ran wild in the Pacific and seemed invincible. The most devastating weapons in their navy were their aircraft carriers. In 1942 the Americans had been driven from the Philipines and Australia was in peril. The next step in their campaign was to seize control of the American controlled island of Midway.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;The Americans had different ideas. They had cracked the Japanese code and were routinely reading their secret messages. They uncovered the Japanese plan to attack Midway and decided to gamble everything on ambushing the Japanese carriers. The Yorktown was rapidly repaired and sent to join the Enterprise and Hornet. The Japanese air strike hit Midway Island hard. But then the Americans located the enemy carriers and attacked. The shocked Japanese retaliated but lost all four of their carriers.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Yamamoto had once said that he was afraid that the United States was a sleeping giant, which would awaken with a terrible resolve. He was right.&rdquo;<br/><br/>A miniatures wargame of aerial attack intended for classroom use with two teams of students (grades 6-8). The game is designed to be played on two 7.5x5 foot tables, one containing the American fleet and one containing the Japanese fleet.

It was published in the 80s in Greece by Imago and is no longer in print.<br/><br/>It is played by 3-5 players with one of them not taking active part but playing the role of a general supervisor. Basically, he takes all the non-player roles in the game, like the traffic controller, the insurance agent, the examiner for the driving license etc)<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to drive your car in such a way so that you won't run out of money and at the same time create problems to the others to drive them to bankruptcy. By moving various pointers on the board you try to avoid STOP signs, obstacles etc so that you 'll save money, while forcing the other players to make violations and pay fines. How the pointers will be moved and the random events that take place are determined by random card draws.<br/><br/>The game contains:<br/>A driving map<br/>A series of bank notes<br/>Four automobiles<br/>A series of cards<br/>A table with violations, fines and questions that need to be answered in order to obtain a license.<br/><br/>",

Where possible we have used sources from near the end of our period as these provide informed comment as well as facts.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>We expect that these rules will be mainly used with Napoleonic Troops, and hope that we will now see the last of French Infantry attacking in line, instead of in columns covered by skirmishers and accompanied by horse artillery!

        "description": "Kokkolan laivanvarustajat - Skeppsredarna i Gamla Carleby (Shipowners of Kokkola) is a historical boardgame where players try to become the richest shipowner in Northern Europe. The game takes place in the 18th and 19th centuries, when Kokkola was one of the most significant maritime towns in Finland and a major export hub, especially of tar and timber - essential commodities for the large navies of the major European powers of the time.<br/><br/>In the beginning each player has a small ship which can carry one unit of cargo (initially, tar). Cargoes have a fixed buying price and profit depends on which port they are sold in. Each port provides 1 or 2 types of cargo, roughly historical - London wants tar and timber, provides luxuries and salt - and by trading in this way, players try to amass the biggest fortune before the cargoes run out.<br/><br/>Each round a player can sell or buy cargo and buy a bigger ship (carries 2 units) or cannon, which protects from pirates. Movement is by dice rolling, and before sailing a player takes a 'sea-card' with varying results - a pilot who helps in reaching the next port, pirates who steal the cargo, favourable or adverse winds or a special price event. The latter are also historical, such as the unrest following the French Revolution causing increased demand for grain in Amsterdam, or events of the Crimean War.<br/><br/>When the last cargo is bought, the game ends and the player with most money wins.<br/><br/>",

As you sail the seas trading and pirating, you travel through the ages encountering the invention of the wheel, the great pyramids, Tutankhamen's magnificent mask and other great human achievements.<br/>Can you fill your treasure chest with the most loot through cunning trading and pirating? <br/>A cut-throat game of adventure and intrigue, Riches 'n Rascals is an exciting educational game where players discover world history without any background knowledge.  No two games are exactly the same, enabling players to play indefinitely, discovering more &amp; more about world history.<br/><br/>How Riches 'n Rascals is played:<br/>On your turn you roll the two dice (a numbered die and &lsquo;scroll&rsquo; die) and move your boat counter filed with gold, diamonds or other treasure to lands near and far.  You trade with other lands at their home port and pirate other players by landing on their boats.  If a &lsquo;scroll&rsquo; die is rolled, you consult the &lsquo;History Scrolls&rsquo; - read out what is happening in this place and time in history and follow the Scrolls&rsquo; instructions.  If great achievements are happening in history you may get to double your loot or have a second turn, if there is strife - you may lose your loot or miss a turn.  Any loot you safely bring back to your home port can be placed in your Treasure Chest where it is safe from all pirating.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Portal is a two-player abstract game played on a hex board where player's attempt to capture each others pieces.  Each player has four different sized units that can move different amounts of spaces on a turn (1-4).  Pieces are allowed free movement but may not move through a space they have already occupied that turn or move through another piece.  Pieces can only capture in a straight line of hexes equal to their movement amount and may jump other pieces when capturing.<br/><br/>A key aspect to Portal is the turn structure.  On alternating turns players will make one and two movements.  That is, on turn 1, P1 will move once and P2 twice.  On turn 2, P1 moves twice and P2 moves once and so on.<br/><br/>A portal board consists of three seperate types of &quot;special&quot; hexes.<br/><br/>The middle hex is the Portal.  If you begin your turn with a piece in the portal you may move it to any open open, non-special space on the board and then make your movement(s) for that turn.<br/><br/>The spaces surrounding the portal are weakened.  A piece in those spaces may not make a capturing move, except a &quot;1&quot; may capture into the portal only.<br/><br/>The red corner spaces are protected.  A piece in that space cannot be captured, however, it must be moved out of that space on the player's next turn or it is removed from the board.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has one or fewer pieces remaining on the board.  Each remaining piece scores points equal to its movement value.  The player with the higher score wins.<br/><br/>Portal is currently entered in the nestorgames continuous abstract contest as well as the 1,000 Year Design Challenge.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/48043/item/1260124#item1260124\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/48043/item/1260124#ite...</a><br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.thousandyeargame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.thousandyeargame.com</a><br/><br/>",

Seja esperto e aproveite para fazer com que os outros comprem cartas e voc&ecirc; fique com a m&atilde;o vazia. Na hora do Rock'n Rooll n&atilde;o deixe que os outros o ultrapassem e descartem as cartas primeiro. Com agilidade e inteligencia voc&ecirc; consegue vencer o jogo. Divers&atilde;o n&atilde;o vai faltar para quem joga Rock'n Roll.<br/><br/><br/><br/>O objetivo do jogo &eacute; esvaziar sua m&atilde;o. Para tal, voc&ecirc; deve sempre jogar uma carta com 1 n&uacute;mero acima ou 1 abaixo ou com o mesmo n&uacute;mero da carta anterior.<br/>Quando entra em jogo a Carta Rock'n Roll, n&atilde;o tem mais ordem de jogo. Joga a carta quem quiser e tem que seguir o comando da Carta Rock'n Roll (jogar apenas cartas vermelhas, apenas pretas, etc.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>A fast-paced cardgame!You need to get rid of all card in your hand to win. Be smart and take the chance to force other players to draw cards while you empty your hand. When it's Rock'n Roll time, do not let the other players discard their cards first. You can win the game allying dexterity with intelligence. Leisure is guaranteed when you play Rock'n Roll.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards. Each player goes in a clockwise direction and needs to play a card with a number that exactly 1 below, the same or 1 higher than the previous card.<br/>When someone plays a Rock'n Roll Card, there's no order of play anymore, each player plays a card following the Rock'n Roll Card rule (only red cards, only black card, etc.).",

Each challenge card features three challenges from the following categories:<br/><br/>&bull; Mind Control &ndash; Get another player to do what's listed on the card, such as asking you to lower your voice.<br/>&bull; Caught in the Act &ndash; Spot someone doing the action listed on the card, such as text messaging.<br/>&bull; Talk It Out &ndash; Start a conversation and find someone who satisfies the condition listed, such as liking werewolves more than vampires.<br/>&bull; Fashion Police &ndash; Find someone who matches the description on the card, such as two players who have shirts of the same color.<br/>&bull; Go Crazy &amp; Challenge &ndash; Do what the card tells you to do.<br/><br/>If you find someone who fits the challenge, then show that player the card and take 1-2 beads from that player, as noted on the card. Discard that card and take a new one. Anyone de-beaded due to a card can choose to discard one card in hand and draw a new one.<br/><br/>The player with the most beads once the preset time limit expires wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Boy Crazy is a simple collectible card game for girls, created by Decipher Inc. during the Pok&eacute;mon Trading Card Game boom.<br/><br/>Cards are distributed in packs of 9 cards. Each card featured a picture of a boy aged 12&ndash;22, his first name, set of statistics about him (height, date of birth, color of eyes), and a list of his likes and dislikes. Cards includes boys from across the United States, from different ethnic backgrounds and hair and eye colors, including disabled boys.<br/><br/>Game is basically a very simple matchmaking game. Minimum requirements for game are at least 9 cards, and each player should have pencil and paper. Play begins when players decide who gets to go first. Using the Boy Crazy cards (9 cards or more), first player secretly writes down which boy she likes best and why. Then the first player lays out the cards so everyone can see them. The other players try to make a match by writing who they think is the best boy for the first player and why. Then, each of the other players take turns revealing who they chose as her match. After the first player reveals her response, scores are tabulated for that round. Each player who correctly matches the first player's response scores a point. Play continues until every girl has a chance for her friends to guess her match. To start a new round players should discard starting set of 9 cards and draw a new set of 9 cards. The player or players who makes the most correct guesses wins.<br/><br/>The game was so popular that Decipher launched a companion &quot;Boy Crazy&quot; magazine in September 2001.<br/><br/>",

Materials: black and white laminated board featuring a course and cartoon graphics, spinner (you can use a 6 sided die, 34 bonus tabs, 7 cutout figures for bunch and riders, 6 rider cards (Bernard, Eddy, Fausto, Jacques, Sean, Tom - functionally identical). <br/>Riders can be either in &quot;the bunch&quot; or making a break out in front or left behind. When in the bunch the rider figure remains on your card where you also place bonus tabs that are accumulated by reaching certain points in the race first and also when rolling on your turn a 4 or 5 if in the bunch, or 6. Main mechanism is roll and move along a track that includes squares for gaining bonus tabs and penalties that can move you back. The race takes the riders past fans, through an avalanche, past a protest, into a thunderstorm, up the Kremmelburg climb, across cobbles and up the Poggio climb before the finish. Each turn, each player spins the spinner (rolls the die), moves individually or stays in the bunch and and after all players the bunch moves. The bunch always moves three spaces. To break away from the bunch you must roll a 4 or more. A minimum of one rider must remain in the bunch. Generally there can only be up to 2 riders per square (1 on the Kobbleburg climb) and the bunch will swallow you back up if it catches you or leave you off the back if it passes you. Players use their bonus tabs to increase their movement rate or to increase the speed of the bunch when the bunch moves.<br/>The strategy revolves around collecting bonus tabs and deciding when and at which part of the course to make an individual break. The winner is the first rider past the finishing post.<br/><br/>",

Depending on the result of the die roll, players can: attempt to be the first to take an egg from the box (or steal from someone else if there are none left in the box); drop an egg on the table and then compete to catch it; or even get up and run around the table to try to be the first back to their seat. When a player successfully wins an egg, he or she then rolls the white die, which indicates the location of the egg; between your cheek and your shoulder, your chin and the breast, between your knees, etc. When the first person drops an egg, the game ends and the one having the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game is situated in the 16th century, when the forces of field marshal Maarten van Rossum occupied the city.<br/><br/>Every turn, players can try to have one of their pawns enter the city. Then they roll the dice to move the pawns that are already in a city. Whenever pawns of different players are on the same spot, the players roll the dice to fight. The losing pawn is thrown out of the city. Instead of moving their pawns, a player can also try to answer a trivia question to &quot;acquire&quot; the location of one of their pawns.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the players has acquired the four location on their secret mission card. Alternatively, the game can also end when a certain number of pawns have been ejected from the city; in this case Maarten van Rossem wins, together with the player who won the most fights.<br/><br/>Rules for a simplified game for children &quot;Amersfoort op Drakenpoten&quot; (Amersfoort on Dragon's Feet) are also included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the early months of 1943, the United States and British Commonwealth forces had finally defeated Rommel and the axis armies of North Africa. The allied leaders were in disagreement on what the next step should be; invade Italy, the Balkans, or France. Stalin was desperate to open another front in Europe. Churchill wanted to invade Italy which he labeled &ldquo;the soft underbelly of the Axis&rdquo;. It was agreed that since no invasion of Northern France could be undertaken in 1943, that the invasion of Sicily would take place. The allied commanders were sure that invading Italy would all but destroy the Italians will to fight, and maybe the government and Mussolini would be overthrown.<br/><br/>The German high command was also aware that Italy&rsquo;s support for the war was dwindling. German units that were needed for the Eastern front were sent to Italy to help defend against an allied attack and to police the Italian army in case of a coup. With most of Germany&rsquo;s army and supplies on the Eastern front and a weakening ally in Italy, Germany is desperate to keep the allies out of Southern Europe.<br/><br/>The Invasion of Italy is an Axis &amp; Allies style game that puts you in the seat of the Axis commanders who are racing to get their army into a position to defend Southern Europe, and Allied commanders who are ready to open another front in Europe to relieve the Russians on the Eastern front. Will you follow history as the allies and invade Sicily and then Italy, or will you try to take Rome first and severe the Axis army in Europe? Can the Axis hold out long enough with their limited supplies, or will Italy fall and leave Germany defending Italy&hellip;..ALONE?<br/><br/>The game features a map of Italy (36&quot; x 48&quot;)(91 cm x 122 cm) divided into controllable territories. One player plays the side of the Axis controlling the Italian and German units defending Italy against the Allied Invasion. The other player controls the Allies who have 20 turns to take as many victory cities as possible before the Germans can reinforce Italy. Game uses a D12 combat system and pieces from the Axis &amp; Allies series of games and is a variant of these games.<br/><br/>The Game comes with map , rules, and some units. You will need additional pieces to play the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(From the game's Consimworld folder)<br/><br/>Battle Royale is the first in a series of games dealing with campaigns of famous 18th century military leaders (Frederick the Great and Marlborough among others).<br/><br/>Battle Royale is a simple wargame about the First Silesian War, 1741-42. The campaign marks the debut of Frederick the Great's military career, however inauspicious this was for him personally. The war began with Prussia taking advantage of a perceived weakness of the new and first Queen of Austria, Maria Theresa, when she assumed the throne. Bavaria, France, and Saxony contested Maria's claim to the Austrian crown, as well as having long disputes over their borders or policies of the Austrian empire. Prussia sought to claim the rich province of Silesia from Austria and in a whirlwind (for the time) campaign in 1740 seized virtually the entire province. Prussia's Allies took longer to mobilize their forces and work out the disputes they had with one another to form a coalition to defeat Austria and overthrow its new queen. A long era of war in central Europe was about to begin. Can you do as well, or better, than your historical counterparts?<br/><br/>The game uses the &quot;chit-pull&quot; system with a deck of cards similar to Paul Rohrbaugh's Pocket Battle Games series from Against the Odds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A pseudo-psychology game, intending to reveal how much you know about your friends and, in return, what they think of you. This is not how to win the game though. The winner is the player with the most points at the end. You earn points by lying, choosing good moves for your playing piece or by drawing cards (100% luck).<br/><br/>Movement is by the roll of two dice. You have two playing pieces (your 'ego' and your 'id'. At ther start, just the ego is used. But once the hex 'Inferiority Complex' has been passed, you bring your id on to the board. Thereafter, you can move one piece the total of the dice rolled or you can move both your playing pieces by allocating one die to the ego and one die to the id. There are lots of cards, five types and when you land on certain hexes you have to take a card and obey the instructions.<br/><br/>",

The setup position puts the king in the center of the first row, with the Bishops left and the Knights to the right. Pawns have no initial double move, all other pieces move as in Chess. Castling is allowed, too.<br/><br/>In practice, two sets of pieces are necessary to execute the game's Shogi-like drops: captured pieces are held in reserve and can re-enter later under the capturing player's control.<br/><br/>Pawns which reach the opposite side promote to a unit in the opponent's reserve (!), if there is one, essentially re-capturing the reserve unit. Captured pawns cannot be dropped and remain out of play.<br/><br/>",

Before the next issue can be printed, six pieces of rashly commissioned copy need to be retrieved from a somewhat motley bunch of recalcitrant writers:<br/><br/>Travel blogger and author of Leicester: City of Crisps Toby D&rsquo;Azure.<br/>Girl-about-town and sparkly-heeled chick-lit tyro Sophie Blush.<br/>Postmodern goremeister and connoisseur of noir Justin Slick.<br/>Aga-endorsing barbour-clad romantic novelist Lavinia Snowe.<br/>Former Para turned lad-mag agony uncle David &ldquo;Dave&rdquo; Green.<br/>Otherworldly and oddly androgynous sci-fi bod CT Vermillion.<br/><br/>All are published authors but, on account of not being published as often as they feel they should be, will still take freelance work wherever they can get it, and aren&rsquo;t too fussed about style or topic: in fact, all insist that being able to turn in stuff &ldquo;outside their normal comfort zone&rdquo; stops them getting stuck in a generic rut and keeps them fresh and edgy; the alternative suggestion &ndash; that they have no shame and will do anything for a free lunch and a small sub to get them through till next Friday &ndash; is, they say, just insulting nonsense. On this, they are all agreed; on everything else, they are united only in their mutual contempt, jealousy, and suspicion. They are, in a word, writers.<br/><br/>And, being writers, all six are currently holed up in six Soho pubs, cadging free drinks, chatting up people half their age (but with, oddly, twice their looks), and complaining vociferously about their agents, about dumbing down in the publishing industry, and about how they didn&rsquo;t want that Eastenders gig anyway as it would have compromised their artistic integrity and also possibly involved buying a TV licence.<br/><br/>The noble editors&rsquo; thankless task is to contact all six writers and extricate their beer/sauvignon-stained prose from whichever unwholesome pocket or handbag it&rsquo;s been stuffed in. The first to do so scores a small moral victory or, to borrow a phrase from Monopoly, wins.<br/><br/>To get from one pub to the next the editors can walk, hail a cab, or grab a Boris Bike. Taxis are fast, but much of Soho is alleyways or paved, and it&rsquo;s not easy finding somewhere to pull up. Bikes are nippy, but what about those cobbles on Broadwick Street? &ndash; ouch! And, of course, this is Soho, where the streets are narrow and the inexplicable commonplace ...<br/><br/>",

The casting of the drama group will take place after lunch break! Who is going to get the leading role? But suddenly an ambulance arrives, taking Marie, one of the top contenders for the leading role, to the hospital. What happened? Was it an accident? Or is somebody else to blame for Marie's sudden illness? And if so, who is it?<br/><br/>In &quot;Das Gift der Rivalen&quot; there are 9 obligatory roles: (4 male, 5 female) and one optional role that can be either male or female. The roles are mostly 13-to-15-year-old students from the drama group and their friends. There are two adult roles (teachers) and the optional role is also an adult (police inspector).<br/><br/>",

In clockwise order, all the other players also play a card. Once all players have played their card, the orange and green cards are scored separately. The color with the higher score wins the trick. If the colors tie, the color with the highest individual card wins. If that is also a tie, the color with the highest card played last wins.<br/><br/>If a joker is part of the trick, it wins the trick for its color, no matter what the score is. If both jokers are played, the joker played last wins. The trick goes to the player who played the winning card. The player who won the trick places the trick in front of himself with the winning card face up.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, when all players have played their nine cards, the color that won the most tricks in that round is the winning color.<br/><br/>Players receive one point for each trick of the winning color and lose one point for each trick of the losing color.  This total score is the result of this round. The results of the rounds are added up as you keep playing. It is up to the players to decide how many rounds they would like to play.

As wealthy tycoons from the 1800's, players compete for power to take influence away from each other while trying to not become a target themselves.<br/><br/>Each round of the game consists of two phases.  In the first phase, players play Arsenal cards with numbers ranging from -5 to 5 in value in front of themselves or other players one at a time.  After each player has placed three cards, the three highest non-tied values gain control of a Power Deck.<br/><br/>In the second phase, the players with Power Decks, which consist of cards representing all the players, vote on a player to take Influence tokens from.  If all three judges pick the same person, that player instead takes three Influence tokens from any players they choose.  If all three judges pick different people, then the judges must each give one Influence token to another player of their choice.  Otherwise, the two judges who picked the same person take one Influence token each from the player they targeted.<br/><br/>At this point, the Dealer passes the Arsenal deck to the player to their left who deals everyone three cards and play goes back to the first phase.  The game ends when every player has been Dealer for one round.  The player with the most Influence tokens at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Each player also has a secret Agenda card with conditions like &quot;Have three 3's in front of you during the first phase of a round&quot;.  If the player fulfills one of the three conditions on their card, they may turn it in and take the appropriate number of Influence tokens from any player(s) of their choice.  They will get a new Agenda card at the end of that round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Deck Delver is a solitaire dungeon crawler type that plays with a small deck. A portion of the cards are dealt face down in a variety of layouts such as &quot;the Pyramid solitaire game&quot;, and then players will have a hand of 5 cards which will act as their inventory of potions and other items.<br/><br/>To explore, simply uncover a card that is free. If it is a monster, you need to fight it by playing a card from your hand, adding the bonus to beat at least 2 of its 3 stats. Once a monster beaten, it goes to your discard pile which in turn increases your inventory like a deck building game. On the other hand, if you miss then you remove cards from the top of your deck.<br/><br/>If your deck runs out its game over. The goal of the game is to reach the dungeon's boss and beat it to reclaim an artifact to become stronger for your next dungeon. In the rule book is included 8 different layouts you can set up the game.<br/><br/>Full color heavy ink version may be found in the link section since the file is too large to upload.<br/><br/>Rules have been updated to V1.3<br/><br/>There is an Expansion currently in the Alpha stage to include a multiplayer co-op rules and new cards too see details below<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Jane Game is a trivia board game devoted to Jane Austen&rsquo;s six novels. It is designed to bring Austen admirers together to share in her stories, characters, wit and language. While playing, each participant enters Jane&rsquo;s world as one of her heroines. As such, you seek after a fortunate life by becoming an accomplished woman, gaining societal experience and choosing to marry or not. Through chance, expertise and choice you could become the envied Mrs. Darcy, the pitied Mrs. Collins or the new roommate of Miss Bates.<br/><br/>The Jane Game is for 2-7 players (Austen wrote seven heroines into her six novels) and lasts about an hour to an hour and a half, depending on how chatty and good-humored the heroines are.<br/><br/>The overall objective is to obtain the greatest Life Fortune. This can be done by trading your accomplishment cards in for something of greater value. The player with the most Life Fortune is the winner.<br/><br/><br/>Designer's Summary:<br/><br/>The Jane Game is a mixture between a role-playing and trivia game. Each player becomes one of Jane Austen&rsquo;s heroines seeking after a fortunate life. This fortunate life is best achieved by becoming an accomplished lady, a societal woman and by marrying well.<br/><br/>The game has two phases: Courtship and Marriage.<br/> During the Courtship Phase, turns consist of either answering trivia (there are options of guidance from a governess for those who are not as well versed in Austen&rsquo;s works) or of acquiring Societal Tokens (Family, Ball, Trip). Trivia answered correctly gives Accomplishment Cards, which are used to acquire Societal Tokens.<br/><br/>The Marriage Phase is quick and starts once the first heroine is married. At this point, each heroine goes to the church where proposals come according to how well trivia is answered. She then can choose her hero (i.e. Mr. Darcy), alternate (i.e. Mr. Collins), or to not marry at all (i.e. become Miss Bates&rsquo; new roommate).<br/><br/>Once all heroines have the option to marry or not, Life Fortune Points are counted and the heroine with the most wins.<br/><br/>",

They shuffle the track-half of the tiles, then lay them out. Players take turns trying to match tracks to animals, advancing the time-tracker whenever they're wrong. If they match all the animals before night falls, they win.<br/><br/>In the second game, players use the harder side of the paired tiles, but otherwise gameplay is the same.<br/><br/>In the third game, players use both the animal and tree tiles, laying out one half of these pairs. Players take turns revealing one tile from the other halves, and every other player race to find the match, claiming the tile when doing so.<br/><br/>",

Players make up family trees during the game learning russian history and lifestyles of different generations. Family Tree inculcates interest to country&rsquo;s past and own family history in a game form and develops improvisation and counting skills.<br/><br/>How much do we know about our ancestors? Where were they from? What job did they have and what were they fond of? How did they find their partners in life? We rarely think of it in our childhood but it&rsquo;s getting harder to find the answers by each year passing by. That&rsquo;s why it is so important to rouse up children&rsquo;s interest in family history as early as possible. Understanding of generation continuity and forefathers&rsquo; connection with historical events is just necessary for the child to grow up as an all-sufficient and self-contained person.<br/><br/>Each player is telling a story of a common Russian family, constructing its genealogy table. The game is based on the character cards with people of different generations on them, born in pre-revolutionary times at the first half of the 20th century towards to people of nowadays. Each character has a name, a profession, a date of birth and a portrait designed in a family picture album style &ndash; all these traits combine into a whole appearance of a typical representative of his age and social group, like a soviet scientist or a present-day manager, for example.<br/><br/>Single characters don&rsquo;t form a tree yet &ndash; they should be bound with family relationships. Married couples, children and parents need to be matched by age. It can be calculated in mind but birth dates are added to the cards for more convenience. After all, firstly, husbands and wives should meet each other: play a meeting card and tell a short acquaintance story. Also there are some event cards which can be played at the character, suitable by age &ndash; passing through the Great Patriotic war, attendance at Yuri Gagarin&rsquo;s first space flight start, election to State Duma (Russian Lower chamber). In such a way a personal family history binds with the global history of the country.<br/><br/>There are two varieties of game rules: &ldquo;The big family tree&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dynasties&rdquo;. The first one better goes with big companies up to 10 players and is suitable for the first play.

On one side you have the Mayor - respected, powerful, able to affect real change. On the other side you have the Village Idiot.<br/><br/>Challenge other players to a battle of skill and luck. Add to the rules of the game as you seize power but beware! No one is above the law. Claw your way to the top and do your best to stay there in this fast, fun, trick taking game with a twist! Village Idiot plays in less than an hour for 3-10 people. You'll be jumping right out of your seat!<br/><br/>Based on several classic party games, Village Idiot combines trick taking, rules making and six rounds of play with every round progressively changing as players build upon the basic rules.<br/><br/>Objective: Become the mayor of your small, medieval village.<br/><br/>Game Play: The entire deck is dealt out to all of the players. The deck consists of numbered cards from 2 - 15. Several cards have special abilities or act as wild cards.<br/><br/>In round one, whoever has the Start card (a 4) begins play. Each player must then play one or two cards of a higher number. Play continues clockwise. The first player to discard all of their cards becomes the Mayor and scores 5 points. The second becomes the Councilor and scores 4 points, and so on.<br/><br/>The last player with cards in their hand becomes the Village Idiot.<br/><br/>Players then rearrange their seating So that play begins with the Mayor, proceeds to the Councilor and so on. The player who has become the Mayor then gets to add one rule to the game, which must be followed until the game ends. Any player who does not follow this rule finds themselves drawing more cards rather than playing them.<br/><br/>The game continues for six rounds, with seating changing and new rules entering play. At the end of the sixth round, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Easy to learn as all of the rules fit on two standard, poker sized cards. Village Idiot can be played with family or friends and be as fun or as cutthroat as you want it to be!<br/><br/>",

Add a deck of cards with pre-specified questions (descriptions), in response to which all players vote for which animal best fits that description. Points are scored for voting for the most popular choice! Players are entitled to guess the identity of their animal after scoring 10 points.<br/><br/>The components include cards (identities and questions), headbands, name badges, dry-erase markers and voting wheels.<br/><br/>",

The game takes 5 minutes to learn, and lasts 30 minutes or longer (depending on how much fun you are having).<br/><br/>Each round begins by revealing a new Objective card and choosing &quot;the best way&quot; or &quot;the worst way&quot; to pursue it. Each player in turn then adds a sentence fragment, using one of their images cards, to extend or to improve the current story - playing off of what others have played.<br/><br/>A player just created a hilarious twist to the story? Give them a Appreciation Token for their creative contribution. Someone's new addition sounds like the best way to accomplish the objective, instead of the worst way? Challenge their card, and make a convincing argument to your friends. Branch the story onto a new path to take the tale in a new direction. Think up a creative ending to the collaborative story to finish the round. All will gain you Appreciation Token, an acknowledgement for your creative thinking throughout play.

        "description": "Sanasokkelo (which means word labyrinth) is Finnish word game. Game consist of circular board, which has four rings of letter spaces and one letter space in the middle. Nearby letter spaces are connected with lines. There is 73 of these rounded holes in the board. At the start of every game you will randomize cardboard letter tiles to these holes. Now you decide how long you will play and turn around the board. Then everybody tries to make words with letters, that are connected with lines. When you find a word (at least four letters long), you shout it and collect the points. You get one point for every letter in the word you found. You get special points, if you can use the letter in the middle or letters in the third (red) circle. When time runs out, the player with most points is the winner. The game can be played in any language, which have approximately same letter distribution in words as in Finnish.<br/><br/>",
