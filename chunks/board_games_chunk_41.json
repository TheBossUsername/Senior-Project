Pilots of other Axis nations also achieved ace status in the cockpit of a Bf 109, including pilots from Italy, Romania, Croatia and Hungary. Through constant development and improvements, the Bf 109 remained a potent and competitive aircraft.<br/><br/>The G series, or Gustav, was introduced in mid-1942 taking its cues from the prior F series (which featured new wings, an improved cooling system and adjusted fuselage aerodynamics). The G series further improved upon the engine, mounting a more powerful 1,475 PS DB 605 engine. It had a multitude of variants, ranging from high altitude fighters with pressurized cockpits to photo-reconnaissance and even a two-seater trainer. As the war wore on, further variants were introduced with water injection boost and high-performance superchargers added, to meet developing tactical requirements.<br/><br/>The Bf 109 achieved more aerial kills than any other aircraft of World War II. Many of these were against an inferior (in both training and equipment) Soviet Air Force during Operation Barbarossa. The operation resulted in the loss of 21,200 Soviet aircraft, of which, about half were to combat.<br/><br/>As the war progressed and the Allies made increasing bombing incursions into German territory, the environment became ever more target-rich for Bf 109 pilots, allowing for over 100 individual Luftwaffe pilots to be credited with 100 aerial victories each. This group in total claimed almost 15,000 kills - resulting in more than 2500 Luftwaffe pilots to be considered aces.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are the captain of a hot air balloon fleet, trying to pop your opponent's Crown Balloon to emerge from battle victorious. Navigate the skies of random chance and rely on strategic trickery to pop your opponent before you yourself are popped.<br/><br/>More simply, the goal of the game is to pop the balloon/Blink your opponent designated as the &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; before they pop the balloon/Blink you designated as your &ldquo;Crown.&rdquo; Players take turns single clicking their opponent's balloons to reduce their health and eventually pop them. Watch out for any Trap balloons! These are Blinks that will cause you to lose immediately if you pop them. The catch is, the location of each player&rsquo;s respective Crown and TrapBust balloons will only be known to them. It&rsquo;s a game of hidden information and bluffing! Two players recommended, but can easily accommodate more!<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Distribute Balloons<br/>Divide the Balloons/Blinks evenly among the players. Each player clusters their balloons together, and assigns each balloon a color.<br/><br/>Single-click a balloon to cycle between Red (high health), Blue (medium health), and Green (low health). For even fair play, make sure each player has the same number of each color. To give one player an advantage, allow them to have more high-health balloons.<br/>Create Special Balloons <br/>Decide how many Crowns and/or Traps each player will have. Again, for even play, each player should have the same amount.<br/><br/>Long Press a balloon to designate it as a Crown. Single-click it to cycle between the Crown and Trap Balloon designation. Crown Balloons appear yellow, and Trap Balloons appear purple. Long-pressing again will reset it back to a regular Balloon.<br/><br/>While creating these special balloons, make sure to hide your selection from your opponent - this step is where your strategic trickery begins! It might seem obvious to always select a Red Balloon as your Crown since they take the longest to pop. But your opponent knows this too, so they may start clicking the Red Balloon first. Knowing that, you could instead select a Blue Balloon as a Crown, making your opponent waste 3-6 clicks popping a non-Crown Balloon. Let the game theory begin!<br/><br/>Triple click one balloon on each player's cluster to move to start the game. Your Crown and Trap balloons will now appear as regular balloons, and the health of all balloons will be set based on their color.<br/>Gameplay<br/>On their turn, players take on of two actions:<br/>Attack<br/>Click an opponent's Balloon to reduce its health, shown by the number of faces lit. Each click reduces health by 1. When a balloon is reduced to 0 health, it pops, revealing whether it was a Crown, a Trap, or neither.<br/><br/>[diagram of slowly reducing health and death]<br/>Fortify<br/>You also can use your turn to fortify your own balloons. Remove a single balloon from your cluster to activate it - a single white face will appear on the Balloon. When you reconnect that Balloon to the cluster, it will transfer 1 unit of health to the Balloon it touches with the activated face.<br/><br/>Only balloons with at least 1 health remaining can be used to Fortify, and Balloons with 6 health cannot receive fortification.<br/><br/>Win Condition<br/>There are multiple ways to win Battle Balloons. If you pop all of your opponent&rsquo;s Crown Balloons, you are the winner!<br/><br/>[diagram of winning]<br/><br/>If, instead, you pop your opponent&rsquo;s Trap Balloon, they are the winner!<br/><br/>[diagram of losing]<br/><br/>To reset the game, double-click any Balloon in your cluster to go back into Setup.<br/>Alternate Setup<br/>If you are playing with very few Blinks, you can instead give all Blinks to a single player and let them make the setup, then pass the entire cluster to the next player. That player then plays through the game with that cluster, counting the number of rounds it takes to win or lose.<br/><br/>In addition, you can play with more than 2 players. In a multiplayer game, you choose who to attack on your turn. If a player&rsquo;s Crown Balloons are popped, they are out of the game. If you pop a Trap Balloon, you are out. The last player standing wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the far-off future year of 1902, our Steampunk world will run on the greatest of all inventions: the Dynamo.<br/><br/>Dynamos are powered by touch, but each charge only lasts about a second. If a Dynamo runs out of power before being recharged, it will burn out and die. Once activated, Dynamos must continue to be recharged by touching them before they die out.<br/><br/>Dynamo is 3 party games in 1 small package!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPower Struggle<br/> Dynamo power is scarce, and you must fight to keep the lights on.  The goal is simple: be the last person to keep your Dynamo alive and operational.<br/>Setup<br/>Distribute 1 Dynamo Blink to each player.  Players should place their Dynamos on a table or other flat surface, keeping a finger on their Dynamo at all times. Players can change the color of their Dynamo by double-clicking it.<br/><br/>For a more intense game, try playing without a flat surface.  But be careful! Dynamos are tough, but not unbreakable!<br/>Gameplay<br/>All players begin the game at the same time by activating their Dynamos with a single-click.<br/><br/>Your goal is to keep pressing your Dynamo to keep it alive... by any means necessary! Distract, tempt, bargain, and befuddle your opponents on your path to victory.<br/><br/>If your Dynamo dies, you&rsquo;re knocked out of the round.<br/><br/>Win Condition<br/>The winner of the round is the last player to keep their Dynamo alive and operational.<br/><br/>After a Dynamo dies, it can be reset for the next round with a double-click.  It will glow with a new randomized color to indicate that it's ready for play.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tBulb JugglerYou are a street-performer, and juggling Dynamos is your bread and butter.  Try to keep as many of your Dynamos  lit as you can before dropping one!<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Gather Dynamo Blinks together into a group. Double press them to put them in the ready state, each with a random color gently pulsing.<br/><br/>You can also play with a friend by starting with one Dynamos and having them pass you additional bulbs while you play.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Start the round by single pressing any Dynamo.   As it starts to fade, continue to add more Dynamos to the game as you play, pressing their buttons to keep them alive.  If any of your Dynamos die the game has ended.<br/>Win Condition<br/>The game ends when at least one Dynamo dies.  Keep count of how many you can keep alive before any of their lights go out.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tElectron DriftElectron Drift  is a &ldquo;hot potato&rdquo; meets &ldquo;egg toss&rdquo; style game for 2 or more players, using Dynamo Blinks. Pass Dynamos back and forth, keeping the current flowing before losing the charge!<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Players sit around a table or across from each other. Assign one Dynamo Blink to a starting player. For added complexity, try letting additional players start with Dynamos.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The starting player single presses their Dynamo to start the one second charge. Then  they pass the fading Dynamo either to the player next to them or across from them.<br/>Players continue to pass their Dynamos back and forth until one dies. The player responsible for letting the Dynamo die is eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>The player nearest to the knocked out player may pick up the Dynamo, reset the charge with a double click, and pass it along to continue the game.<br/>Win Condition<br/>The game ends when only one player is left standing.  The last player to keep the Dynamo alive is the winner!<br/><br/>If only playing with 2 players, players may alternatively pass the Dynamo  back and forth, keeping track of how many passes they make before their Dynamo dies.<br/><br/>",

Across the war-torn regions of the Mediterranean, the Axis powers of Germany and Italy control much of the theater. But the mighty nations of the United States and Great Britain are on the move, launching a massive offensive &mdash;code-named Operation Torch.<br/><br/>But where will the secret Allied fleet choose to land its assault? Will they reclaim air superiority, control the sea, and gain a foothold in the underbelly of Axis-held Europe, or will Axis forces repel the Allies back in a storm of blood and fire?<br/><br/>Song for War: Mediterranean Theater is a tabletop strategy game based in the contested regions of southern Europe, north Africa, and the Mediterranean Sea during World War 2. Representing one of four nations, players must work together as the Allies (US or Great Britain) or Axis (Germany or Italy). Players have the option to set strategy, move units, attack and defend as individual nations or simultaneously as the Allied or Axis team. Innovative mechanics allow players to deploy their land, sea, and air units strategically as combined forces, with faster units moving first and more often, followed by heavy units with stronger firepower. Take strategic objectives, control shipping lanes and resupply, deploy new technologies and units, and recreate historical events to defeat the enemy and win the day.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You are one of few who become a &ldquo;Volunteer&rdquo;...those who decide to answer the call.<br/><br/>The goal sounds simple enough: Make your way to Oakhaven Castle to meet the Crown Prince and hear his request. He believes there are ancient scrolls that uphold the Curse and by finding the scrolls, they can be destroyed and end the Curse once and for all. However, the last six ancient scrolls are guarded by Dark Guardians, ancient creatures transformed by the Curse to protect the scrolls. No one has been successful in retrieving these last six scrolls.<br/><br/>As you journey through Oakhaven you will meet others and learn details that help you learn of Oakhaven's history, the Curse and ultimately reach a conclusion about what is really happening within the kingdom. The paths you choose will bring you to the final chapter where one last decision will change you and the kingdom forever.<br/><br/>Dispel The Darkness is a cooperative game for 1 to 6 players. Yes! You can play this solo! A cooperative, light-weight RPG, card drafting, dice rolling experience, with an end-game twist that will leave you speechless. This gateway RPG will introduce non-gamers to the fun, dungeon-crawling experience with a story to keep everyone riveted until the end. With high player interaction, downtime is nonexistent.<br/><br/>As players progress through the story making choices presented by the 70+ page Story books, they gain XP by drawing cubes. XP is then used to purchase items and skills to level-up and protect themselves from the inevitable confrontation with the Dark Guardians. Drawing too many red Threat cubes will initiate a Threat Event, so be prepared to battle each time you level up!<br/><br/>Story Battles introduced throughout the game will challenge players to strategic fights that aren't often found in most dungeon-crawling board games. Through Dispel the Darkness' serpentine battle system, characters must be well-balanced and thoughtful about how they approach each battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crownfall is a 2-4 player game where players take turns flicking their army of Blinks at their opponent&rsquo;s Blinks to try to knock them out of the battlefield.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>CHOOSE YOUR BATTLEFIELD<br/>First, choose a smooth surface such as a floor or tabletop to be your battlefield, and set the boundaries of your arena (the edges of the table, or lines on the ground). Then create a real or imaginary line to divide the battlefield in half and choose a side. This determines where you can place your army during<br/>the game.<br/><br/>ASSEMBLE YOUR ARMY<br/>Next, take an even number of Blinks and divide them in half between the players. If playing with more than 2 people, players will need to group up into 2 teams.<br/><br/>Each team clusters their Blinks together and then single-clicks any Blink to swap between the two team colors.<br/>To muster an army, triple-click any Blink in the cluster to turn it into a Crown. All other Blinks will become the army. Blinks will assign themselves one of 9 roles depending on how many Blinks they are away from the Crown Blink. As you play, try to find a unique setup formation that creates your <br/>perfect strategic army.<br/><br/>Finally, each team distributes their army throughout their side of the battlefield, making sure that no two Blinks are touching. The game then begins with the starting player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/>The goal of Crownfall is to reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Crown to 0 health. Each turn, a player can perform up to 2 actions. A player can use one or both of their actions to flick one of their Blinks, generally with the goal of knocking enemy Blinks off the table, but sometimes to accomplish other strategic ends. Unless otherwise specified, a player cannot flick or activate the ability of the same Blink more than once in the same turn.<br/><br/>Players can also choose to activate the power of one of their army Blinks as an action. Many roles have a power that can be activated with an action, but several have passive powers which do not require an action. All powers are detailed at the end of the rules. If, during play, a Blink connects to another Blink, you must separate the two by 1 inch and rotate them so that they are no longer aligned to each other. Some powers may affect this rule.<br/><br/>If a Blink falls off the table or out of the bounds of the battlefield as the result of a flick, whether intentional or by accident, that Blink is dead - unless it&rsquo;s a Crown or affected by a special ability. Set your dead Blinks to the side, out of the battlefield&rsquo;s boundary but within reach of the players.<br/><br/>WIN CONDITION<br/>The first player to lower their opponent&rsquo;s Crown to 0 health wins!<br/><br/>To reset your army and start a new game - cluster your Blinks together and triple-click one of them to reset the cluster back to setup.<br/><br/>VARIANT RULES<br/>Crownfall has multiple rule variations and alternative modes of play. For all variations and a more in-depth explanation of the rules, see the full instructions document online at blinks.games.<br/><br/>",

Players use cards like workers in a worker placement game. An opening card draft allows you to build a winning strategy from the very beginning.<br/><br/>Players compete to accumulate 15 resource points or construct 3 buildings to win. All players begin with the same 4 unbuilt buildings and 6 drafted cards. Buildings not only lead to a possible victory, they also provide helpful bonuses as long as they remain complete. Each turn progresses through 4 phases: the Seasonal Phase, Construction Phase, Action Phase, and End Phase.<br/><br/>In the Seasonal Phase, players take different actions depending on the season marked on the Season Board. In Spring, players gain a free card. In Summer, players can build for free. In Fall, players gain free resource points. And in Winter, players reduce the resource points or hurt the buildings of unprotected players.<br/><br/>In the Construction Phase, buildings that are partially built will progress on their own. Players may also spend a resource point to help one building along. In the Action Phase, players will play Action Cards. Some cards can only be played in certain seasons or when players have completed certain buildings. If no player has reached a victory condition in the End Phase, players continue with the next season.<br/><br/>Choose your cards wisely as you decide your path to victory!<br/><br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

A dice makes the game more exciting as it allows players to perform certain actions depending on what is rolled.

The key to expanding Wilderness Dice is making sure to include the proper number of dice. For the first two players, add 12 dice. Each additional player should add 3 dice to the total. Players will still only complete three rounds of dice rolls. This does mean that more players will have leftover cards at the end of each round.<br/><br/>The Ancient expansion includes both Dinosaurs and Cryptids. Naming the set was difficult, and ultimately is named in honor of the two animals being vastly older than any other animal in Wilderness Dice (if cryptids actually existed, they&rsquo;d surely be old).

        "description": "Each player should have three 12oz beverages in front of them (alcoholic or nonalcoholic). The game involves rules that can either add sips or remove sips from a player's glass<br/><br/>Each turn players will roll the die and move their bottle cap piece to the corresponding square. There are 36 squares in the game. The squares may have you draw a card, play a mini-game, or require action. Each square will either decrease the number of drinks in your glass or increase your lifespan, so to speak. (I.e. giving drinks increases your glasses capacity while taking drinks lowers it)<br/><br/>Be among the first three players to make it to the finish line without finishing your three drinks. The game is a race to the finish with a gold medal (1st). silver (2nd), and bronze (3rd).<br/><br/>After a player gets sent back to the start or finishes their three drinks and is forced back to the start, they are not required to follow the &ldquo;lifeline&rdquo; rule but must follow the drinking rules.<br/><br/>The game ends when three players have reached the finish, achieving gold, silver, and bronze. Once a player has reached the finish, they are exempt from mini-games or drinking aspects of the game (unless they choose to join the fun).<br/><br/>",

Push, Run, Hide, and Kill your way through an endless horde of zombies in an attempt to be the first to escape the facility.<br/><br/>Players draw cards using a modified UNO game mechanic and try to escape before the deck runs out. Some cards can  turn players into Zombies.  When this happens, players still try to escape.<br/><br/>The first human player to get rid of all their cards (escapes), wins.  Alternatively, a zombie player must escape before the last human player dies.<br/><br/>As part of an elite biological threat elimination squad, you find yourself deep in the heart of an underground military complex known to be in possession of a deadly new chemical weapon. It quickly becomes clear things are far worse than expected when buried in the thick darkness of the subterranean halls you discover actual zombies!  The deafening roar of automatic gunfire erupts as you pump round after round into the horde, filling the narrow corridors with muzzle flashes and gore. As the sprinting river of gnashing teeth and rotting flesh pours out of the dark, you realize the futility of your defense and turn back toward the exit. Overwhelmed and starving for ammo the mission priority shifts from completion.. to survival.<br/><br/>Can you escape this nightmare? Or will you become part of it?<br/><br/>",

The snow leopards in the mountains to the north, the jaguars to the east in the plains, the tigers to the south near the jungle, and the lions to the west in the grasslands. These four kingdoms have been at war for as long as can be remembered - and they&rsquo;ve built nuance to their battle plans over centuries. Can you lead your Kingdom to victory?<br/><br/>Competing Cat Castles is a game of deduction, risk, and luck for 2-4 players. Your goal is to win more competitions than your opponents. Each round you will select one of the nine cards representing the key players in each kingdom. Every cat plays a part, from the Monarch down to the youngest baby. Several of these key players have abilities that can hinder your opponent, or boost your next turn. Players play their chosen cat face down and reveal them simultaneously. The cat with the highest power wins, after any abilities have been applied.<br/><br/>Keeping track of who your opponents have played and who you have to counter them will lead to victory, but never discount luck.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players take turns planning out a course of action before rolling dice to see whose tactics come out on top.  By using a combination of weapons, armor, and cards in hand, players create a plan of attack (or response to an incoming attack) each turn. The goal is to knock the other player&rsquo;s health points to zero through clever card combinations, while simultaneously preventing your own defeat by planning tactical defensive moves.<br/><br/>Gameplay is divided into two major phases. The planning phase sees players laying out their actions for the turn, which represent attacks and blocks that the players will perform. The resolution phase has players rolling combinations of dice as dictated by the cards they played in the planning phase in order to determine what attacks hit or miss, and what damage (if any) is dealt or avoided.<br/><br/>The starter set includes: Volcanic Warrior &amp; Shadow Assassin.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This wargame was designed by O&rsquo;Farell &amp; Robinson and printed by Hely&rsquo;s of Dublin in the 1940s (most likely the early 1940s). It may very well be a prototype. The game was first owned by a Dublin printer in the 1940s and remained within the same family until 2022.<br/><br/>Similar to some other wargames of the era, the objective is to capture the enemy&rsquo;s GHQ using a variety of combat units while defending your own GHQ. In WARCHESS the units are comprised of infantry, tanks, artillery, forts (which remain stationary once placed), trucks, and trains. The latter two allow you to move eligible units a greater distance. WARCHESS is played on a game board showing a map of Western Europe with square &ldquo;hexes&rdquo; created using a vertical and horizontal grid.<br/><br/>Contemporary games to this include Dennis Wheatley&rsquo;s Invasion (1938) and Campaign (1935) by Wills &amp; Hepworth Ltd. Campaign would be the most similar in play, with WARCHESS being more complicated due to the availability of more unit types.<br/><br/>",

But be careful. Fellow associates are attempting to do the same thing, and once you play a dirty trick on them, they now have access to this new trick. Anyone who has worked in an office environment knows there is no more brutal kill-or-be-killed workplace than the modern office setting.<br/><br/>Thrown Under the Bus (TUtB) is designed so that non-gamers could easily learn and enjoy but still has the complexities and advanced tactics that will keep seasoned gamers engaged. TUtB hits that delicate balance while creating a fun thematic experience. An average game takes between 30 and 60 minutes depending on group size of 2-6 players and their experience level. The Ages 16+ is more of a theme suggestion, the mechanics and rules can easily be understood by younger players but we felt why get them jaded about work before they enter the workforce. Let them discover that joy the same way we did&hellip;<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;t let the cut throat theme fool you, Thrown Under the Bus is fun and cathartic release at the end of a long week of dealing with your coworkers quirks and protecting your station at work.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Iron Brain: The Siege of Beirut, June-August, 1982.<br/><br/>For over a year the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) had bombarded Israel&rsquo;s northern province of Galilee with artillery and rocket fire. On June 6, 1982 the Israeli military invaded southern Lebanon in an operation dubbed &ldquo;Peace for Galilee&rdquo;. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) quickly defeated the PLO&rsquo;s armed forces and drove north. Although the declared aim of the Israeli offensive was to clear a 40 kilometer &ldquo;buffer zone&rdquo; along the Lebanese/Israeli border, Israeli Defense Minister, Ariel Sharon, was determined to eradicate the PLO once and for all, and hopefully kill its leader, Yassir Arafat. With new orders the IDF crossed the Litani River and drove on Beirut where the remnants of the PLO&rsquo;s forces were retreating, and where most of their refugee camps were located. What ensued was an escalating conflict that threatened to engulf the entire mid-east once more in conflict and bring Lebanon to the brink of abyss of genocidal civil war.<br/><br/>Each copy of Operation Iron Brain is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets<br/>&bull;    One sheet of 140 double-sided, unmounted counters<br/>&bull;    One Players&rsquo; Aid Sheet<br/>&bull;    8 pages of rules<br/><br/>Armor and Infantry (Militia, Regular, Heavy Weapons) units are all Battalions. Airborne and militia units are companies. A hex on the map is about a half mile across. Each turn represents two weeks of time. The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh and features graphics by David Gomez Prieto.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Die Dohlen vom Dohlenfelsen (&quot;The Jackdaws of the Jackdaw-Rock&quot;)is a wooden family game from 5 years, made in the Urdonautal in the heart of Bavaria. Who remembers best which caves the jackdaws bring the magic stones to and, with a bit of luck, will reach the bulging caves. You always have to keep an eye on which caves the most jackdaws have flown to and which cave has not been cleared out for a long time. Whoever has collected the most stones by the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Die Dohlen vom Dohlenfelsen is a memory game with 3D construction and a sophisticated 'cave system' into which small pebbles are thrown. If you want to clear out a cave, pull the plug out a bit and the magic jackdaw stones will crackle out of the game like in a slot machine. The game is stored in a yellow cotton bag that is certified with the Oeko-Tex label. This bag serves as a base when playing, so that one can speak of an 'unpackaged game'. In addition to the 3D game board, the game also includes 6 game figures. Also included: 22 wooden foundation stones, a handful of hand-sorted pebbles, a small piece of twig peeled with a pocket knife as a stone pick and a color cube. The silhouette of the jackdaw rock is hand-cut. Also the bite of the beaver is sometimes bigger, sometimes smaller, sometimes bitchy and sometimes jagged and sometimes other accessories have been gnawed on a bit. Each game is therefore unique, which is acknowledged with a consecutive serial number and the name of the summiteer who owns the game. These two pieces of information are found on the front of the Jackdaw Rock game board.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Unknown powers endlessly summon, shift, and banish these obelisks, igniting massive rifts between dimensions. Through these rifts, Mensors have learned to channel their powers to manipulate this phenomenon. They have come to call this eternal cycle... Obelus.<br/><br/>Obelus is a light-weight, 2-player abstract strategy game, playable in 10-15 minutes. Taking on the role of a powerful Mensor, you will summon obelisk shaped dice onto conflux cards, shift your obelisks according to the number showing, and banish your opponent&rsquo;s obelisks. Through clever maneuvering, banished obelisks may be reformed, creating a rift that prevents further summoning on that conflux. You win when your opponent cannot legally summon or shift an obelisk!<br/><br/>Two game modes are included:<br/>- Chaos: In this mode, dice are initially rolled into the center of the game area, adding a layer of emerging strategies in how players will make best use of the numbers rolled.<br/>- Pure: This mode offers perfect information. Dice are never rolled, offering players full control over their chosen number as they are summoned and shifted around the game board.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Dan and his team have been very involved with many different TCGs, like Pokemon.<br/><br/>In a game of Elestrals, your Spirit cards are your most important resource: they are your health and fuel when playing cards and attacking your opponent! Knowing when to use your Spirits and when to save them is a key strategy.<br/><br/>There are five types of Spirits. Most decks have a mix of different types, and the Elestrals and Runes that you Cast will often need specific Spirits or even combinations of them!<br/><br/>To get started, each player has to have the following:<br/><br/>     A Spirit deck with exactly 20 Spirits in it. You can mix and match different Spirits or play as many of the same ones as you like!<br/>     A Main deck with exactly 40 cards in it. This is where your Runes and Elestrals go; you can only have up to three copies of any single card, so you need some variety.<br/><br/><br/>And that&rsquo;s it! You can look through your own Spirit Deck any time you like and ask your opponent how many cards are left in their Spirit Deck. But you never* get to look through your opponent&rsquo;s decks, so you won&rsquo;t know exactly which Spirits they have left. Once your Main Deck is shuffled at the start of a game, you can&rsquo;t look through it unless a card tells you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They spend their turns building rockets, launching rockets, or playing cards that can either help with building/launching or can disrupt/hinder their opponents. The more parts that are added to a rocket, the better chance of a successful launch, which is determined by a roll of a die. Players can either choose to be safe and build parts on the rockets to increase the odds of a successful launch, or can risk taking a dangerous launch that has the potential to crash and destroy the progress they have made on their project. Agencies go through a total of five projects, ending with the Mission to the Moon, the first agency to achieve this last project wins the game.<br/><br/>Compete with your friends in a fast paced strategy game to see who can lead their space agency to the Moon first! This game is easy to learn, but has many different strategies you can employ leading to fun replayability. This game combines the fast pace risk taking of a dice game with the cunning strategy of a card game. How will you lead your space agency? Will you play it safe or take risky launches? Will you focus on your own projects or use espionage to disrupt your opponents?<br/><br/>",

Entice the planet's people to flock to your utopia or manipulate, steal, conquer, crush your way to victory.<br/><br/>CIVITAS 2230 is a strategic game for gaming groups that love tactics, political swindling, challenging scenarios and total story immersion. A &quot;learn as you play&quot; game that can be tailored to fit the time you have at the table, as well as your choice of cooperative, versus. or solo modes.<br/><br/>The game is controlled by a rigid Game Round structure. Players play out from their starting rectangular Presidential Mats and build their city by placing the Hexes they can afford to build. Hexes provide further bonus resources (Reputation, Ether, Ion, Material Cubes, or Policy Points) to allow for more Hexes to be drawn and placed in later turns, thus increasing the size and power of the player's city.<br/><br/>Workers are placed to activate certain Hexes, and unique characters, known as CNXpats, provide more extraordinary bonuses and special abilities to manipulate play in favour of the player who activates them. Other elements like drawing further Hexes, bidding for policies and earning additional bonuses for a player's total population, make up the rest of The Game Round.<br/><br/>Players win the game by reaching either 25 or 50 overall Reputation depending on the scenario.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "King of Battle is a strategic modern battlefield game for two players. It was designed by a US Artillery Officer, and was made to teach modern battlefield tactics to tabletop game players.<br/><br/>By planning artillery strikes one turn in advance, you will attempt to predict where your opponent will move their pieces, and then deal deadly artillery strike damage to the targeted square. Your tanks and infantry will attack in real-time as you maneuver your pieces to avoid your opponent&rsquo;s artillery strikes and advance to victory.<br/><br/>Win the game by destroying your enemy or forcing them to surrender. You must surrender if you destroy too many of your own units through poor artillery planning, or if you find your artillery is outnumbered by your opponent's. Artillery is king, and you cannot function without them.<br/><br/>Due to variable terrain placement, every game explodes with new strategies. Guessing where your opponent will move their pieces provides an addictive twist on modern strategy games. The end game never drags; it is designed to provide a quick ending, so that you can start the game again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Asli is a territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board). There is also an off-board location called prison.<br/><br/>This game is based on Lifeline.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA group is a stone along with all stones one can reach from it through a series of steps onto orthogonally adjacent stones of its color.<br/><br/>A group is alive if there is a free path along the lines of the board between that group and another group of its color. The path does not need to be a straight line. A group is also alive if there has never been more than one group of its color on the board. A group that is not alive is dead.<br/><br/>A territory is an empty point along with all points one can reach from it through a series of steps onto orthogonally adjacent empty points. You own a territory if all stones orthogonally adjacent to it are of your color.<br/><br/>An incursion is a placement by one player in a territory owned by the other player. An incursion is minimal if it causes exactly one enemy group to be moved to the prison.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of these actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Remove an enemy stone from the prison.<br/>     Place a stone of your color on an empty point, then move all dead enemy groups to the prison. If the prison now contains stones of both colors, remove pairs of opposite-colored stones from it until at most one color remains.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of your turn, there must be no dead friendly groups on the board. You cannot make a minimal incursion if your opponent just made a minimal incursion.<br/><br/>The last player to perform an action wins. If a stone placement recreates any previous board position with the same player to move, the game ends in a draw. This is possible in theory, but probably requires colluding players.<br/><br/>Before the game begins, to make it fair, the first player places a number of black stones in the prison, and then the second player chooses sides.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chennis is a Kyoto Shogi variant where pieces promote or demote on every move, creating a highly dynamic rally over a tennis court-themed board. Captured pieces may be dropped or &quot;served&quot; back onto the board, as in Shogi, and Kings are restricted to their own court or the net, similar to Xiangqi. Chennis also includes pieces not found in International Chess such as the Cannon and Soldier from Xiangqi, and the Ferz from Shatranj. Drops, alternating piece promotion, and restricted King mobility mean that there are surprising diversity of ways to mate your opponent and win despite only beginning the game with four pieces plus the King.<br/><br/>",

This player is now the active player.<br/>     Start the sand timer. All players (including the active player) have 1 minute to come up with a scenario and a background story for the rumor (why it happened, how things ended up that way, secret motives, or whatever you like). Be as bizarre and disturbing as you can be. Keep notes on your Dry-Erase Card so that you don't forget.<br/>     Once the sand timer is up, each player unravels their story, starting with the active player and moving clockwise. Try to be as convincing as you can and persuade everyone you have the real story.<br/>     Then, every player votes for the best story by writing their favorite character name on their card. And no, you cannot vote for yourself.<br/>     When everyone is ready, reveal your votes. Every player gets as many points as the votes he/she has received. If someone is voted by all, he/she gets one extra point.<br/>     Circle the number of points you received on the numberline of your Character Card and update it after every round to keep track of your total points.<br/>     With each new round, someone new becomes the active player.<br/>     The game ends when all players have been the active player once (for 5-6 players) or twice (for 3-4 players).<br/>     The player with the most points is deemed the absolute Rumor Freak of the Town.<br/><br/><br/>FUN FACT: If the WHO card starts with &quot;my&quot; (example, my mom) we're talking about the active player's real mom. Not their character's mom. Their real mom.

And why does it feel like those screams are getting closer?<br/><br/>The Shrieking Hollow is an expansion that adds a new threat and a new space to explore within The Night Cage. Pits now connect prisoners to the Hollow, where The Other lies in wait. Over the course of play, The Other will rise up out of the Hollow and attack the prisoners, destroying any part of the maze it encounters. If the prisoners are brave, they can leap into a pit and fall to the bottom of the Hollow where the dim light of their candles will stop its advance, temporarily. However, they can't hold it back forever, and prisoners that stay too close to The Other will be attacked when it lurches toward the flickering light it despises.<br/><br/>If you are looking to increase the dread and horror of the original game, The Shrieking Hollow is for you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As a challenge is defeated, another takes its place, with 57 challenge cards in total. As you face the challenges of the Well, you may play a skill card from your hand only when it matches the color of the challenge card, e.g., if you're facing a red challenge card, then you may play only a red skill card. Some cards have two colors, and some are white, that is, wild. If the card you play does not defeat the challenge, you'll be able to add some progress to it and attempt it again, though you may suffer a penalty for doing so.<br/><br/>Other seekers can provide help by playing one of their own cards as a boost, but beware. Running out of cards nets you an exhaustion card before you can draw a new hand. Exhaustion cards are never good, but some are worse than others.<br/><br/>Defeating a challenge provides you a reward, such as regaining health or delving deeper into the Well, which is represented by discarding unseen challenge cards. Once you've made your way to the bottom of the Well, you'll face Callous himself. All Seekers share a health pool, and if the pool reaches zero, you're defeated. This is a game that requires teamwork and persistence as the wells of Atios are unpredictable and quite dangerous.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo; Great War at Sea: Jutland Second Edition is a game tightly focused on the Battle of Jutland in May and June 1916. Jutland: North Sea 1914 extends the story into the battles that happened, or could have happened, before the Battle of Jutland: Helgoland Bight, the Scarborough Raid, the Yarmouth Raid and more.<br/><br/>Jutland: North Sea 1914 adds 43 more scenarios to Jutland Second Edition, all of them set in 1914, the first year of the Great War. During these early months, leaders on both sides thought they could reach a decision at sea, and that they needed to hurry, since the war would be over by Christmas time.<br/><br/>We use the same approach as Jutland Second Edition: a deep dive into the history of the campaign, using the game scenarios to help tell the story. It&rsquo;s taking the old advice to &ldquo;Show, Don&rsquo;t Tell&rdquo; to a whole new level.

Each round, each player draws four plant cards, then takes four actions simultaneously:<br/><br/>&bull; Cultivate: Place one plant card from your hand into your habitat.<br/>&bull; Harvest/Burn: Place one plant card from your hand face down next to one of the four creatures in play to upvote or downvote their appeal.<br/>&bull; Pollinate: Pass a plant card to the player on your left, while receiving one from the player on your right.<br/>&bull; Prune: Discard a plant card from your hand.<br/><br/>Your hand size increases by one plant card each round, and at the end of four rounds, you score cards in your hand and habitat. Reveal the cards in front of each creature to determine its prestige; if a vote card was played upside down, it counts as a downvote, lowering the value.<br/><br/>Score points for each plant card in your habitat and hand based on which creatures they appeal to. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

So naturally, you fight over it.<br/><br/>The game lasts for 6 rounds. Players start each round by refilling their hand (tableau) with elemental cards from a shared deck. A shared resource pool called the mana pool is also filled. Players are randomly assigned to spaces along a board called the Leyline. Their position shows their current &quot;Element.&quot; The adjacent elements on the Leyline determine which card effects they can use.<br/><br/>Players take turns completing 3 actions to move, acquire cards, and use effects. The last rounds provide boosted versions of the 3 actions. Each of the 9 Elements has a unique effect and point distribution.<br/><br/>After the final round, players will count points from cards in their hand that match their element on the Leyline. Highest point total wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The echoes of terrifying roars, war chants, and the clinking of beer glasses resonate and mingle with the rustling of the trees. At the heart of this nocturnal theater, where only the brave dare venture, stands the sanctuary of the Monks of Loupblonc. Guided by ancient devotion and an insatiable thirst, these secluded heroes dedicate themselves body and soul to their ultimate quest: to brew the most enchanting elixir the world has ever known, beer. Their secret? Werewolf blood, a rather uncooperative ingredient to be honest...<br/><br/>In Moonlight Brewers, you take on the role of Trappist monks competing to create the supreme beer. But this challenge can only be met on a full moon night, when the werewolf animals are out. Both predators and prey, these creatures represent a real danger, but also a vital component for the concoction of the much-coveted brew.<br/><br/>To brave the night and concoct this exceptional beer, you will need to develop breathtaking strategies, while counting on a bit of luck.<br/><br/>Gameplay: <br/>Following the first edition of this game released during the first french lockdown (covid), we have chosen to keep only the basic concept, while completely rethinking the gameplay to offer a more strategic, more dynamic, and above all, more entertaining experience.<br/><br/>In turn, each player can perform one of the five available actions: move, gather ingredients, equip, hunt werewolves, or attack other monks. Actions can be carried out simply to obtain lower quality resources or more diligently for better benefits. However, being diligent generates noise and requires rolling a die. Our cunning monks can influence the outcome of their dice by consuming beer, at the risk of becoming clumsier and noisier.<br/><br/>Noise attracts the various werewolves, who will not hesitate to attack you fiercely.<br/><br/>Campaign: <br/>Moonlight Brewers Triple Fermentation also includes a campaign of 14 scenarios (10-12H of gameplay) that will take you from moon to moon in search of the title of the best brewer of the year. Inspired by the live-action role-playing games of the Yucca Company, this adventure promises twists and surprises.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This is done by drafting cards from a shared display and playing cards from your hand into your personal tableau. Card costs are relative to their levels and element type, with costs being paid by discarding matching element cards or animals of the same type. Costs are also supported by all of the animals in your personal tableau of the matching element types. There can be only one of each animal type in all players tableaus, so plan carefully to time your ascensions when playing older animals to remove your opponents younger ones.<br/><br/>The game takes place over two rounds which represent the moon and sun cycles. Once the draw deck runs out the 1st time, the moon cycle completes, triggering a short scoring event. Afterwards, all cards are shuffled for the 2nd round, or sun cycle. The game ends once the deck empties a 2nd time, which triggers final scoring.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overflight! is a solitaire aerial reconnaissance wargame about the CIA&rsquo;s TOP SECRET U-2 spy plane. It is set in the Cold War from 1956 to 1960. This is the second book of the Special Mission Series from Historic Wings, a publisher whose mission is to publish aviation games that are true to history. Not only will you learn about the CIA's covert air force and the U-2, you will have the chance to see how you would have fared had you been in charge.<br/><br/>The importance of the U-2 program to the US and Allied intelligence communities cannot be overstated. U-2 overflights provided 90% of all intelligence regarding the Soviet military during one of the most critical periods of the Cold War. The program was indispensable to US national security.<br/><br/>Amazon Link: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1QKXK74/?tag=article-boardgamegeek-20\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D1QKXK74/?tag=article-boardgameg...</a><br/>Blue Panther: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.bluepantherllc.com/products/overflight\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.bluepantherllc.com/products/overflight</a><br/><br/>In the game, you play both in the role of the CIA&rsquo;s U-2 Program Director -- historically, Richard Bissell -- and, when you fly missions, you take on the role of the pilots themselves as you navigate over Soviet-controlled territory to photograph your targets and, if all goes well, return safely. All of the pilots in your CIA Pilot Roster are recruited from the US Air Force and &ldquo;sheep-dipped&rdquo; &ndash; thus, they&rsquo;re &ldquo;officially civilians&rdquo;. Two other pilots are drawn from the ranks of the Royal Air Force (RAF), just as in history.<br/><br/>In 1956, your missions will seem easy. The Soviets have little chance of intercepting your U-2s as they soar beyond the reach of even the highest-flying Soviet interceptors. However, with each passing year, the Soviets will deploy newer, better aircraft like the MiG-21 and Su-9. Ultimately, you will face SA-2 &ldquo;Guideline&rdquo; Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs), the very missile that shot down Francis Gary Powers on his U-2 flight on May 1, 1960, an event that ended CIA&rsquo;s overflights of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>Among your assignments will be photographing important targets, such as Tyuratam, where the Soviets tested Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) and the facilities at Aralsk-7, a secret Soviet biological weapons research site, and more.<br/><br/>Be prepared to sweat out your missions -- will you succeed or will one of your pilots die trying?<br/><br/>The game was developed from declassified TOP SECRET and SECRET documents sourced from the CIA. It is a narrative-style game with extensive decision-making and features a mid-sized tabletop footprint and easy-to-learn rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As described by Dr. Scott Simmerman, the publisher:<br/><br/>Lost Dutchman is a well-designed team building game that focuses on collaboration, leadership and engagement. It is designed to be facilitated by a trainer or consultant interested in generating discussions about the organizational culture and framed around desired outcomes. It comes with extensive debriefing ideas. It is a business simulation but useful for schools and other organizations looking to improve collaboration.<br/><br/>It is normally played with 5 / 6 people on a team, with 3 to a 100+ teams. It can play with as few as 6 people but the design works much better with 12 or more. It is proven to scale up really well for large group events of 150 to 250 or more people.<br/><br/>Dutchman is designed for large team building / strategic planning events but works well for small group classroom training situations. We sell versions for different size groups.<br/><br/>The Design:<br/><br/>The challenge is to collaborate, rather than to compete, and to share resources and do sufficient planning to optimize overall results. The reality is that teams often choose to compete, thus making choices that sub-optimize results.<br/><br/>Components include a colorful map, a Grub Stake of resource cards, planning tools, job aids and other information about the game and the goals. Putting on cowboy hats and bandannas, the group settles in to briefly hear the history of the Lost Dutchman's Mine and to learn the mechanics of the challenge.<br/><br/>The team is given 20 days of 2 minutes each to manage their journey to the mine and back home to Apache Junction. They can choose from 3 paths with different risks, planning for weather changes and focusing on the optimal use of resources. Teams are given the opportunity to gain additional information valuable to their journey's success but must decide if they are willing to delay their start by one or two days in order to obtain this information. After being given the introductory information, the team has 15 minutes to plan. They must work together to make decisions about tactics, resource management, direction and risk.<br/><br/>The 20 days of play (roughly 35 minutes) begin and are marked by lots of lively interaction among players and teams in the spirit of collaboration and competition. During this time, they'll discover the impact of their early decisions on their results. They can choose to get advice or collaborate with others.<br/><br/>The goal is to get to the mine, mine as much gold as WE can, and return to Apache Junction. All teams are successful, but the ones that plan and collaborate will optimize their results. Debriefing can focus on collaboration, planning, leadership, motivation, optimization of organizational performance results and many other themes.<br/><br/>",

But every time a player takes a turn, the Crown will march forward and the Imperials will take a turn, launching devastating attacks against the revolution.<br/><br/>Players can combat the Imperials by resolving Azadi Cards. From Jallianwala Bagh to the battle of Yorktown, each Azadi Card is a unique event from history.<br/><br/>Each Azadi Card has two sides, presenting players with two divergent paths of resistance. Will players take the path of peace and sit on a hunger strike, or will they take up arms and assassinate their oppressors? Each choice in an Azadi Card belongs to a certain Ideologue. Players must choose their path wisely, for their choice will unlock a new zone, and a Resistance Card belonging to that Ideologue, strengthening that Ideologue for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>For every action you complete on an AZADI Card, you will gain legacy. Spend your legacy to erect Monuments to your sacrifice and earn new powers once your nation gains Azadi. If players resolve the number of Azadi Cards required by their difficulty, and a final Foundation Card before time runs out - Azadi will be theirs.<br/><br/>But the new sovereign nation will need a leader. Players must compete in the first democratic elections of their country to see who will be declared winner.<br/><br/>What will you stand for? And what will freedom cost?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mythos: Vengeance of Ognyan is a combat-driven and strategy dependent RPG board game. It follows the steps of three heroes, who set out to slay a legendary Zmey, who has risen from the grave. Vengeance of Ognyan is a core-set and includes everything you need to play in a total of 4 game modes!<br/><br/>During the Vengeance of Ognyan campaign, players will be able to pick one of three available heroes to venture out alone or in a party with one goal: to slay Ognyan once and for all. Each character has their own mechanics and relations to the others. Every one of them has their own die, stats and skill trees. During turns, players will have a chance to move and then initiate combat, but dice will determine the success of their announced actions. Positioning also plays a large part of strategizing your way to victory: while standing next to specific characters, you gain different buffs or debuffs.<br/><br/>During the Campaign players will follow open-ended quest-lines, which can lead them through different routes to victory or failure. Each quest is tied to a location and a setup. Every location has its own rule set. You place your heroes, arrange the enemies and proceed with combat until you achieve victory. That can mean different things, depending on your current quest goal - like slaying all enemies or surviving an onslaught for a given number of turns. During a campaign run, players will have to complete numerous encounters, cleanse dungeons and participate in many events before the party reaches Ognyan&rsquo;s Lair. You can also invite a more experienced fourth player to join you and act as your guide through the world of Mythos, but if you do &ndash; their word becomes the law of the game, as long as it&rsquo;s fun for everyone!<br/><br/>With every battle, the heroes grow stronger through a leveling system. If a player can bank enough experience tokens, their hero can level up. The player will have to choose one of two available skill options and with each choice their hero will become a unique result of their play through. But watch out &ndash; enemies gain levels proportionally to the party as well!<br/><br/>After you've mastered the game's rules and mechanics, you can try one of the other game modes present: Ognyan Unleashed, RNG Challenges and Player versus Player Combat are there for more experienced adventurers or those, who are looking for a fast battle without context. Better yet - now that you have these tools at your disposal, you can design your very own epic adventures and share them with the Ognyan Slayers community for a chance to win awesome rewards!<br/><br/>The World of Mythos awaits you. It's time you rise and put an end to Ognyan's tyrannical reign once and for all!<br/><br/>You can have a look at the Mythos: Vengeance of Ognyan public rule book here: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://1am.studio/Mythos-Vengeance_of_Ognyan_DigitalRulebook.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://1am.studio/Mythos-Vengeance_of_Ognyan_DigitalRulebook...</a><br/><br/><br/>    The Vengeance of Ognyan core-set is the based on the &quot;Mythos&quot; franchise by 1AM Studios, which is inspired by ancient Slavic mythology.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players must solve mysteries, stop cultists and prevent the Red Eyed Demon from spreading corruption while advancing through the story.<br/><br/>Players roll custom dice and use the results to perform a variety of actions to solve mysteries but if they dabble too much the powers of evil may become too strong to stop. Unsolved mysteries allow the Red Eyed Demon to spread corruption and the heroes may lose their lives or sanity. However, death and insanity aren&rsquo;t the end. Heroes may persevere while mad or as ghosts. Such a fate brings the Red Eyed Demon ever closer to his goal of total domination. Players who complete the story face a climax which is a different challenge in each chapter.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One player controls the insurgents and the other controls the operatives. Players are encouraged to play through each campaign as one side and then switch sides to play the campaign again. A campaign of CQB tells a story as it follows the operatives from mission to mission.<br/><br/>The Rules<br/>Quick-to-learn rules, presented as core rules and advanced rules, ensure you will get your models onto the battlefield as quickly as possible. Core rules are easily remembered while advanced rules can be referred to as needed.<br/><br/>The presentation of the Close Quarter Battle &ndash; War on Drugs rulebook focuses on the Drug Wars, but you can easily adapt these rules to any modern conflict.<br/><br/>",

Pick one of the 4 set of images: robo-animals, neural dataset digits, robo-edibles, and robo-vehicles. There are 6 levels that teach Artificial Intelligence concepts on top of coding concepts.<br/><br/>The idea is easy - play a board game, train bots with code, and learn AI - all in a fun and exciting Neural Adventure!<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>CoderMindz is a card-based programming game for ages 6 and up. The goal is to use the cards you draw each turn to move your Bot across the grid on the board to get from your Start to your End.  The cards use various types of coding commands, starting with Move and Zap, and building on that with Conditionals, Loops, and Functions.<br/><br/>Six different levels of game play move you from learning the cards (basic and advanced training) to using those cards to move about the gameboard and pick up items (image recognition) and finally to programming the Bot's entire journey at once and then &quot;running&quot; the program to see if you're successful or need to go back to debug. Along the way, you can Zap another Bot (in your line of sight) back to their Start. The first Bot to their End spot is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Flies attacked the troops, soldiers froze during the winter nights and were overcome by heat during the summer. Dust turned to mud when the banks of the Tigris overflowed during the rainy season.<br/><br/>A war no side wanted but compelled to fight, the affair was mostly a see-saw string of battles both against each other and the elements.

Victory comes down to how well you know your character and fellow players.<br/><br/>In Inventures, there&rsquo;re no dice, game master, or numbers to track. Instead, Inventures relies on a powerful and novel game mechanic involving symbol interpretation.<br/><br/>When your character faces a challenge, you choose between options, each composed of a randomly drawn ACTION and OBJECT card.<br/><br/>You secretly pick which option best represents how your character would solve the problem. If the other players successfully guess which option you chose, your action succeeds and the story progresses.<br/><br/>Because of its modular symbol interpretation system, you can use Inventures to play stories in any setting imaginable: Westerns, SciFi, Fantasy, or a game set in the world of your favorite books or movies!<br/><br/>Games can be as short as 45 minutes and as long as weeklong campaigns.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Draw directly on the sheet to show where you go and what you score. When you landed somewhere it becomes your spot, no one else can score for that combination.<br/>When you land you also collect water resources to be able to roll more times and collect points to be able to win. If you want you can use your roll to instead invest in technology, to get various bonuses for the remainder of the game. This makes you more likely to reach the more difficult places to land on in our solar system and find the really high points.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to make the most money you can from these games, as well as win the critical esteem of your peers: the much coveted game of the year award.<br/><br/>In the first part of the game, players will draw three idea cards and play two of them into one of three different rows each turn. Each of these idea cards has a number and a suit and represents a particular theme (e.g. zombies), a mechanic (e.g dice combat) or component (e.g. sand timer). Each theme card bears a unique piece of box art inspired by classic games and each mechanic card features a brief but clear definition.<br/><br/>Using a poker style ranking system, better combinations of ideas score more but each row must also be a higher rank than the one below it. If the players fail to achieve this, they go bust and make no money from their rows. Since the players can&rsquo;t move ideas cards between rows once placed, they must make careful choices about what combinations they attempt to make. To help them, they can also play up to one development card a turn. Each of these lets them directly manipulate their cards and break game rules to make the most money and win the first part.<br/><br/>In the second part, players may pitch one of their rows as a game to the other players. It must have a title and include all four idea cards in the row in some way into its description. Players will then vote on the game they liked the best and the game with the most votes wins the game of the year award, and the second part of the game. To have the best chance at winning overall, players must weigh-up their investment in maximizing the score of their rows vs how useful they will be for their pitch, if they choose to make one.<br/><br/>",

In this stand-alone, competitive card game for two to six players, you play a thief out on the prowl trying to snatch up the best loot the town has to offer before your friends do.<br/><br/>Core game play centers around the construction of a job that comprises one entrance card and any number of path cards. Once the collected path cards add up to a value equal to or greater than the target number found on the entrance card, the job is complete and the player is allowed to take the top loot card from the community loot pile.<br/><br/>However, not all path cards are positive ones. Your opponents will play negative path cards, along with a myriad of different trick cards, in order to make sure that they are the ones finishing their own jobs and grabbing the best loot before you can.<br/><br/>",

The game is asymmetric &ndash; one player (or a team of up to three) attacks the castle, and the other player (or team) is defending it. Knight models come in six colours. All knights are armed with either swords or maces. The blue ones always attack the castle, and are the only team to have two catapults. The red ones always defend. Four of the red knights have bows and arrows instead of melee weapons. The remaining four teams are black, orange, yellow and green. The number of knights in different teams is not always the same. There are always more defenders than attackers. Combat is conducted in duels. Mace wielding combatants have the upper hand, but the outcome is decided by rolling the dice. Each player is trying to overpower their opponents by outnumbering them in isolated combats. Apart from the knights, the box also includes a king, a queen, a princess, a wizard, a dragon and a squire. These models are used in special scenarios.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "History of Civilizations is a card-driven civilization game for 2 to 8 players that depict the rise and fall of empires from 4000BCE to 1900CE. Each player leads his empires to Glory through conquest, trade, science, religion, wealth, culture and many other means. The player with most Glory at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>History of Civilizations differs from most other civilization board games as each player controls several civilizations at once. The game is divided into 5 Ages and takes place on a map spanning the entire world. Each round, players will take turns playing cards from their hand to build cities and wonders, move units, adopt religions, gain powerful leaders, trade with other empires, produce new units and many other things. Each card also depicts an empire that can be started if the game has reached a certain age and an event. Events can be played to affect the game in many ways; everything from natural disasters, generals, spies, revolts, golden ages and usurpers is included in the game.<br/><br/>Each empire has an individual set of Glory conditions that define what that particular empire must achieve in order to earn Glory points (victory points). For example, the Mongols want to be the largest empire in the world and conquer other empires, whereas England wants to have the most colonies and the largest navy. At the end of each round, all empires in play gain Glory according to their empire card. If an empire is performing poorly, it can simply be discarded to free up that empire slot, allowing you to play another empire later. This way, new and more modern empires keep coming into play as the game progresses.<br/><br/>History of Civilizations has many small and simple parts that make up a complex and highly dynamical game, where no two games will play out the same way. Imagine western history without the Romans and Greeks. What if the Aztecs and Incas held out against the Spanish conquistadors? What would the world look like if you made all the decisions?<br/><br/>",

Limanowa &ndash; where the legendary Hungarian cavalryman Ottm&aacute;r Muhr died a hero&rsquo;s death heading his glorious hussars while protecting Jabloniec Hill, situated next to the town, with his men until their last breath against the Russian attackers. Limanowa &ndash; where the fortunes of war took a turn following the battle, later enabling the Central Powers to launch the offensive operations that culminated in the &ldquo;Gorlice breakthrough&rdquo;, bringing about the much-awaited victory. Limanowa &ndash; where we can now play out the World War I battle again and even rewrite history. Will Austro-Hungarian forces again succeed in reining in the &ldquo;Russian Steamroller&rdquo;? Or will the glorious victory be earnt this time by the Russian Empire&rsquo;s soldiers?<br/><br/>Heroes of Limanowa is a World War I strategy board game for 2 to 4 players. The gameboard &ndash; the battlefield &ndash; covers the region surrounding Limanowa, Gorlice and B&aacute;rtfa, where the clashes, in reality, took place in December 1914 unfold during the game. Players personify the commanders of four different army corps as two opposing parties: Austro-Hungarian units are at war with the forces of the Russian Empire. Accordingly, the Austro-Hungarian side can opt to stand ground as commander of the Hadfy Group, tasked with protecting Limanowa against the &ldquo;Russian Steamroller&rdquo;, or as commander of the Szurmay Group forging ahead in the Carpathians. On the other hand, any player may assume command of the Russian Army Corps VIII sieging Limanowa or the Russian Army Corps VII, fighting against the Szurmay Group in the Carpathians.<br/><br/>The gameboard features clashes&rsquo; locations and topographic conditions, including forests, heights, settlements, as well as roads and railways of strategic importance, with high precision. Units can be deployed to battle or organized into defensive position taking endowments of terrain into account. Players may use three different types of unit &ndash; infantry, cavalry and artillery units &ndash; in combat.<br/>Beyond these, all army corps possess 3-3 officer&rsquo;s units (Hadfy, Brusilov, Szurmay, Orlov, etc.), which have unique capabilities and sport the strongest combat value. Together with officer&rsquo;s units, the game contains some 70 miniature figures. In their operative concepts, players are assisted by various battle cards featuring combat plans. The total of 100 battle cards can be divided into three large groups: strategic cards, tactical cards and artillery cards.<br/><br/>In the course of the game, both parties aim to achieve final victory, which can be met through taking control of settlements indicated among strategic targets, the complete annihilation of an enemy corps or liquidating all enemy units. On the path to the ultimate goal, the winners of all minor clashes receive extra rewards; thus, further battle cards can be acquired with winding up an enemy unit or seizing a settlement listed among strategic targets.<br/>Prepare for war and break the resistance of the enemy! Run down your foe with your fearless hussars or death-defying Cossacks and destroy its artillery units or prowl in his hinterland behind the frontline! Launch a sweeping charge with your infantry or use your machine-gunners to chip away your enemy&rsquo;s momentum! Deploy your reliable artillery units to eradicate your opponents confined to defence or use them to support your troops preparing for siege! Play out your battle cards resourcefully to do away with your enemy or set them a trap! Be the victorious general of the battlefield, the greatest strategist who breaks through the front and forces the enemy into retreat!<br/><br/>",

If they make it to the end, the active players play poker.<br/><br/>Now, none of this truly matters to the criminals that wander into this saloon. LIE all you want. Just don't get caught! Or...get caught and challenge your accuser to a duel in the street to win your way back into the game and unlock an amazing Vengeance ability that could turn the tide of the game!<br/><br/>So GAMBLE, CHEAT, DUEL, DISTRACT, or TELL THE TRUTH...Just WIN<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wit Clash is a tile based strategy game. The goal is deceptively simple: to be the first in completing a 3 x 3 grid of black Asset tiles, arranged in 3 columns (hollow, striped or solid) and rows (triangle, circle or square).<br/><br/>These 9 standard Asset tiles must match the icon on the gaming tray. The black Wildcard (star), a mobile tile, completes the set of 10 Assets. It can be placed/moved anywhere within the 3 x 3 grid, but is not a precondition for victory.<br/><br/>The game set contains 3 sets of Assets for a total of 30 black Asset tiles.<br/><br/>However, such a goal is enabled (or hindered) by Action Tiles, which have an offensive or defensive capacity. Action tiles are therefore the leading characters in this game. The diversity of Action tiles (red or green) provide tremendous flexibility for strategy planning. The action arsenal consists of 12 different actions, for a total of 45 units. Namely:<br/><br/>DEFENSIVE (Green):<br/><br/>     Dump<br/>     Key<br/>     Revert<br/><br/><br/>OFFENSIVE (Red):<br/><br/>     Loot (Triangle, Circle or Square)<br/>     Swap (Tile,Column or Tray)<br/>     Pause<br/>     Disarm<br/>     Lock<br/><br/><br/>Despite the variety of actions available, not all actions are required simultaneously. The game can be executed in incremental dexterity levels:<br/><br/>- BASIC: Dump VS Loot<br/>- PLUS: (Dump + Key) VS (Loot + Lock + Pause + Swap Tray only)<br/>- ULTRA: (Dump + Key + Revert) VS (Loot + Lock + Pause + Swap + Disarm)<br/><br/>Asset and Action tiles are shuffled together in a central tile pool. Tiles are randomly drawn but, from there on, only strategy will prevail.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each of the 2019 set golfers are unique and will perform according to various individual golf statistics provided they play a similar golf schedule as in real life. Each golfer was rated for their driving ability, ability to hit greens, short game and putting. The courses have been rated for each round of play and each hole, based on the 2019 statistics. This helps capture easy or tough pin placements; good or bad weather conditions and easy or hard holes in general.<br/><br/>Made the Cut! includes a risk/reward strategy option for the player when taking approach shots to the Green. You can choose to play standard, with no adjustments to the Golfer card or you can choose to Pin Hunt (PH) or Safe Play (SP).  PH reduces golfer&rsquo;s chance to hit the green in regulation, but if they do, the golfer has a greater chance of sinking the putt. However, a missed Green is on the &ldquo;wrong side&quot;, adding pressure to golfer&rsquo;s Short Game play. On the other hand, a golfer choosing to SP will find it easier to hit the green in regulation, but leave a longer than normal putt. However, a missed Green is on the &ldquo;right side&rdquo;, taking pressure away from golfer's Short Game play.<br/><br/>Play a single golfer through his 2019 PGA Tour schedule, maybe just a handful of contenders or all players that Made the Cut! Play only the Majors, a handful of events or the entire season.<br/><br/>The 2019 PGA Season Set includes approximately 260 golfers who earned at least a single Fedex point throughout the 2019 season AND played enough holes to record accurate statistics. It also includes courses and tournament information for all 44 events played out each weekend of the 2019 PGA Season, including complete fields!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Like in the real racing there are typical motor sport elements like: car setup, tyre type selection, tyre degradation, pit stops, changeable weather conditions, Energy Recovery System (ERS) to manage, DRS zones, slipstream, there are also random incidents like e.g. safety cars, yellow flags, damages, penalties and of course what racing is about  wheel-to-wheel action.<br/><br/>Player will become a formula driver of one of the six most successful currently existing teams and will race on any racetrack in the world with two to six players or in solo mode by controlling &lsquo;bots&rsquo;. FormulaGP offers modular racetracks built from special kind of a puzzle tiles which are stable and easy to configure which allows to build any racetrack in the world. It Can be a slow track with tight corners difficult in overtaking or fast with long straights or similar to any real one.<br/><br/>Gameplay is based on the action cards which represents the speed  and movement types. Players will collect the cards and plays accordingly with an option to build a kind of a combos making the cards more powerful for attack, defense or movement. However, combining these cards will increase the risk level which may end up with some incidents or additional tyre degradation or even a car spin, but with a bit of luck nothing will happen. Dice plays a marginal role in the game and are partially used in quick qualifying session, also to measure Pit Stops, rate the risk consequences and evaluate some incidents. <br/>Like in modern formula cars players have to manage energy recovery system by collecting energy. It&rsquo;s up to players how to use up stored energy as it can be used as additional buffer to keep action cards or to use so-called &lsquo;overtake button' to increase the chances of successful attack/defensive maneuver or just to extend car movement. Each team has different ERS/OT combinations, gear ratios and special team ability simulating different car characteristics.<br/><br/>Basically players needs to play the action cards in a way to keep the balance between the speed, tyre wear and risk level to move the car on the board and stop at the fastest places on the track keeping up the momentum. That sounds simple but taking into account tyre degradation, tyre compound differences, ERS management, different car characteristics, battling opponents for position and random racing incidents it gives a real challenge to keep the pace and win the race &hellip; but if you will take right decisions, you will race smart with a bit of a luck you will become a FormulaGP world champion!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chicago '68 pits revolutionary spectacle against civil order at the Democratic National Convention riots of 1968. Players take the role of either the Establishment or the Demonstrators in this fast-paced game of street battles and political maneuvers. Each side plays from two asymmetric decks of action cards. The Establishment positions tactical forces and police platoons to co-ordinate mass arrests while working the convention floor. The Demonstrators, on the other hand, can pivot from direct clashes to radical street theater; their tactics can be reactive and unpredictable, allowing for wild cat-and-mouse chases and mischief-making across the tear-gassed avenues of groovy downtown Chicago.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game is played over five rounds, with two rounds representing a single day (daytime and nighttime). Each side takes turns playing cards from two decks of action cards. The first deck represents the leadership committees. For the Establishment, this is the Mayor's office, and for the Demonstrators, this is the Yippies. These decks are primarily focused on building/activating card splays and manipulating the board state. The Mayor faction can access the policy tableau with the mandate action, which include activating undercover agents, authorizing tear gas, redeploying the National Guard, and more.<br/><br/>Then both sides alternate playing action cards from their rank-and-file decks: The National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (MOBE) on one side, and the Chicago Police Department on the other. These actions are largely moving and confronting units on the map and claiming strategic positions. The Demonstrators may build and activate their street theater splay, which is a set of location specific one-time &quot;mini-objectives&quot; with unique, combinatorial powers.<br/><br/>At the end of every round, a delegate commits a vote to either side. Demonstrators grow in number, the mayor is allocated funds, and whoever controls a majority of critical city areas is awarded exposure points.<br/><br/>Chicago '68 supports 1-4 players in solo, competitive, co-operative, and team play modes. Game duration is 45 minutes per player, with the typical two player duel lasting 60-90 mins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thousands of years ago, a new era was beginning for humankind. The nomadic hunter-gatherers who had laboriously earned their place on Earth organized into small groups, differentiating social roles, building the first settlements, and initiating a great revolution. Scientists call this period &quot;Mesolithic&quot;, and this game talks about those people.<br/><br/>In MESOS, you are the leader of an ancient tribe, and as such, your role is to nurture the growth of your tribe by adding new members, ensuring its sustenance, constructing buildings, and addressing unfolding events. Each round, you must place your totem pawn on the offer track, then following the pawns' order on the track, you will acquire character or building cards and add them to your tribe. Each card has specific effects and may earn prestige points (PP) as you construct specialized buildings and prepare wisely for the events you will face.<br/><br/>Whoever manages to bring the most prestige to their tribe wins.<br/><br/>",

The player who can earn the most Victory Points wins!<br/><br/>Each player is in charge of constructing the city of Ropoa from nothing to a burgeoning city-state. Players take turns buying resources; Wood, Stone, Glass and Metal. Then use those resources to construct buildings within the city walls. Each building has its own resource cost and provides varying amounts of Income and Victory Points to the owning player. Also, every building is represented on the board by a 3-dimensional model;. The placement of each building will change the face of the city as well as the potential for additional Victory Points.<br/><br/>Ropoa was specifically designed to be a gateway game.

The game is currently in development, and we hope to run several rounds of playtesting in 2019.  When it's ready, it will enter the pre-order process through Compass Games.<br/><br/>I've been calling BTSC &quot;Flat Top on steroids&quot;.  The scale is 16.8 nautical miles per hex; the game includes two maps ranging from Rabaul and Port Moresby in the west to the Santa Cruz Islands and Espiritu Santo in the east. Guadalcanal is just about in the center of the two map sheets when set up.<br/><br/>The game revolves around three goals:  &quot;Fuel 'em, Find 'em, Strike 'em&quot;.  You will need to track fuel status of your task forces, and might have to find an oiler at an inconvenient moment.  Your carriers and long-range scout planes (PBYs, H6Ks, and H8Ks) search for the other side, and when you find them, launch strikes to take out the enemy carriers.<br/><br/>The game includes 1&quot; x .5&quot; counters for every warship and most auxiliaries. Each Air turn is one hour of time; each naval turn represents 3 hours of cruising.  Each hex is 16.8 nautical miles; ground units are mainly regiments and each step is roughly a company.  Plane types are rated for movement and endurance, and all planes can add extra bursts of speed--at the risk of losing endurance.  Planes also have various combat modifiers.<br/><br/>We're going into the first cycle of major playtesting this year, after the revisions several sessions live at CSWExpo in Tempe.<br/><br/>",

While still keeping the rules as simple as possible, it simulates the effect of these differences in a way that requires the player consider them for each individual ship. This should result in a more authentic set of tactics, which are chosen when commanding a fleet.<br/><br/>While Admiral&rsquo;s Order with its original rules is an interesting tactical and relatively realistic game, Sealed Despatches now provides an even more accurate simulation of the weapon technology of the time.<br/><br/>",

Proxy War is the ultimate 2-8 player game of cooperation and competition where players become dictators, rebels, and greedy foreign powers.<br/><br/>Rebels &amp; the Government are in a bloody struggle to seize land &amp; secure Resources for the war. Resources are funneled out to the global market through ambitious Foreign Powers, eager to outdo their rivals. And Military Equipment is funneled in for a quick profit or to shore up an ally&rsquo;s success on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Every 2-3 player match has 1 winner. Every 4-8 player match has 2 winners. Different players have different Victory Objectives. Government and Rebel players are trying to eliminate each other and be the last player on the board. Foreign Powers are competing with one another to be the first to gain 10 Victory Points. The game ends when a player meets their Victory Objective, OR if 10 turns have progressed without anyone winning outright.<br/><br/>Proxy War is made up of 10 turns, with each turn having 3 phases: Collection, Negotiation, Action. During the Collection phase, Government and Rebel players collect Resources cards from the tiles they control. In the Negotiation phase, players trade Resources and Equipment, discuss building Factories together, and coordinating their actions for the Action phase. During the Action Phase, players will have a menu of actions but they can only choose three actions per Action phase (Build, Move, Support, Bombard).<br/><br/>",

Both players select which play to run (in secret) and reveal them simultaneously. The players then look up results on their team sheet.<br/><br/>The love of football and passion for football begins for many with high school football. Chris Doelle and Michael Wright encapsulated their passion for American high school football in their exciting vision of the sport in Friday Night Legends. Friday Night Legends (FNL) allows you to play historic high school teams of the past with team results based on their actual stats.  The core of the FNL game engine is based on hours of in-depth and meticulous hours of research.<br/><br/>The game system is elegant in its simplicity that allows you to do what you want to do coach and play games with your local gridiron heroes. Players act as the coach for their chosen team and make all the critical decisions like their real life counterparts do. In a matchup between two players, you each simultaneously select which play to run (in secret) and reveal them.  FNL elegance comes from its years of development, using a system of a few simple die rolls and simple math of the addition and subtraction of results when the players look up those results on their respective team sheets.  Team tendencies in terms of their breakdown in running vs. passing plays are tracked on the simple game day pads. The easy to use individual team chart replicates the strengths and weaknesses of each team. FNL's unique and easy to use system enables you to compare and play powerhouse larger schools against the small &quot;Hoosier&quot; type size high schools. The fast playing time of 60-90 minutes both allows you to play more games in short order while still capturing the fun and essence of high school football.<br/><br/>Although FNL started out as Texas High School Football, the game's fans started clamoring for teams of their local teams and FNL has started meeting that need.  The game designers responded with adding more teams across the country and continue to meet that demand from game players with the plans to expand their high school football team universe.<br/><br/>",

First, it was just a road connecting Barcelona and the former town of Gr&agrave;cia, now a major district of Barcelona. It became a promenade where Barcelona&rsquo;s citizens went to relax, and was filled with restaurants, coffee shops, ballrooms, theaters, parks, and even rollercoasters. Unfortunately, these amenities were only available to the upper and middle classes, as they were often part of private gardens.<br/><br/>When construction of the Eixample started, all of these features were removed to make room for buildings, but it did not diminish Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia importance. Many rich citizens decided to build their houses there, hiring the most famous modernist architects, who created some of the most iconic landmarks of the city.<br/><br/>Barcelona: Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia is an expansion for Barcelona and thus you need a copy of the base game to play it. The new elements brought by this expansion are Pedestrians who walk along the Passeig de Gr&agrave;cia enjoying various amenities there.

        "description": "&ldquo;Citizens of the United Regions, sons and daughters of this broken world, it has saved us all from extinction. We gather within its walls tonight for one thing and one thing only. To play the game it has given us. Play bravely young champions towards the finals and towards the ultimate prize known to man&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;life!&rdquo;  The roar of the crowd erupts as the holographic Commissioner H.R. Cloverfield fades away.<br/><br/>It is the year 2067. Mankind has regrouped after &ldquo;Gods departure,&rdquo; a series of natural disasters that devastated the world over two decades ago. The surviving populations are now divided by regions governed by various companies and ideas on how to reshape the future. Despite the isolation between societies, they all covet the same source of power. Etherium, also known as &ldquo;E-cellz&rdquo; is the highly efficient energy source of today. This power along with advanced formulas is only generated in the grand vessel amongst the clouds known as the Stadium.<br/><br/>Stadium: A Sport Odyssey (or SASO) is a competitive two player collectible card-board game based loosely on the rules of good old American football. You and your opponent take on the role of Head Coaches hired by a company to take command of their team in the ongoing contest held in the Stadium. By playing with pre-constructed or your own customized team deck of cards, Coaches go head to head playing cards in phase turns. In the last phase the stats of the revealed cards played are tallied and determine the success of the play.<br/><br/>The goal is simple; out think, outlast and outscore your opponent before time runs out. Calling the right plays, managing your players and spending momentum wisely are but a few of your tasks for victory. The real challenge is taking control and maintaining the Stadium&rsquo;s ever-changing environment. Whoever masters this&hellip;. masters the game and future of the world.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix.

Larger scale dungeon games tend to look rather flat and slightly abstract, unless the collector is prepared to put in a vast amount of time and energy to make the game stand out above the norm. Well, with 10mm miniatures you can not only play highly satisfactory skirmish games on the size of a small coffee table, but you can also buy your entire resin dungeon and a complete collection of miniatures for far less money than it might normally cost you to purchase even one fantasy army using the larger scale miniatures made by most mainstream game companies.<br/><br/>A game by Stephen A Gilbert.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Space Commander is a wargame of spaceship FLEETS actions. It's rules are simple enough to be understood by anyone, but give a good depth of strategy and involve different races with different skills and ships.<br/><br/>The game wants to depict BIG fleet battles, with all the clich&egrave; of sci-fi: big capital ships, carriers, flight of fighters and starbombers, elite pilots, heroes, missiles, torpedoes, black holes, big spinal cannons, and so on.<br/>All this while keeping a profound strategy and some sensation of realism and real choices.<br/><br/>RULES:<br/>A game usually consists of 2 factions/fleets, each controlled by one or two &quot;Commanders&quot;. Every Commander has his own set of &quot;order cards&quot;, and his own Flagship: all the other ships of the fleet are &quot;shared&quot; and can be called in combat by all commanders of his own faction.<br/>Before the battle starts, every commander chooses and assigns special equipment/technologies to his faction ships: these represent a fundamental difference in gameplay of every faction, giving special skills to their ships.<br/><br/>Every ship in the game is depicted by a &quot;Ship card&quot;, wich keeps the skills and data of that type of ships: there can be several ships of the same type in battle, and they need only ONE card for all of them.<br/><br/>Every turn, a Commander play an &quot;Order card&quot; to order one &quot;ship-card&quot;: all the ships belonging to that class (example, all the Fireshield destroyers) could then move and fire. If the order comes from a flagship, she can order 2 different ship-cards (including his own), if there is at least one ship of that card near.<br/><br/>The ordered cards get rotated a bit to show it has been activated and cannot be ordered again the next turn (so if there are 2 commanders and one requests for the carrier to act, you cannot order it the next turn but could only &quot;reset&quot; it to active status).<br/><br/>Order cards could also used to activate special abilities on ships (and special equipments) and also have a secondary &quot;effect&quot; and could be discarded to get that effect.<br/>In this way, there are always crucial decisions during the game, like: will I discard a card now to get that missile barrage on my enemy and support the other commander attack, or I will keep it to have more options the next turn.<br/><br/>The game almost never falls in a &quot;cannot order anything&quot; scenario, and a commander can expect to order the units he needs most of the time. But if he spens a great deal of cards to support his attacks, his decision could be limited in the next turns, while he builds back his &quot;hand&quot; of cards.<br/><br/>The firing is very simple, based on normal six sided dices rolls. Very rarely one roll is fundamental, since u can always maneuver and use skills to get the best rolling options for your attack.<br/><br/>The game has several scenarios already, and more races and scenarios are being developed/tested while we WAIT FOR AN EDITOR (the game is not yet published, just my homemade copy for now and some playtesting copies around).<br/><br/>",

H.G. Wells's 1913 Little Wars, was the best known early wargaming book, although only one of a number of early wargaming rules. The many similarities in these rules indicate that H.G. Wells was clearly familiar with some of these when devising his own rules. This book contains selected key wargames all written between 1898 and 1940 including:: Notes on the Robert Louis Stevenson Game (1898) The Great Wargame (1908) War Games for Boy Scouts (1910) Little Wars (1913) by HG Wells Sham Battle 1929 (Extract) by Lt.

        "description": "Admiral's Order: Naval Tactics in the Age of Sail is a simulation of naval engagements between ships-of-the-line and frigates in the Age of Fighting Sail. The focus of the game lies on the wars between Britain and France and her allies in the years 1775 to 1815. Each player takes on the role of an admiral, commander or captain whose command could include a single ship or even a fleet of 20 or more vessels. The core game (&quot;Edition 74&quot;) has seven scenarios to choose from, everything from a small, fast and furious encounter between two frigates to a strategic action involving a total of 35 ships-of&ndash;the-line.<br/><br/>A game turn equates to a &frac12; hour watch on the day of battle. In each turn, players will play cards to execute sailing manoeuvres such as tacking, wearing or changing sail configuration in order to put their ships into position for devastating broadsides or even rakes on the enemy vessels.<br/><br/>In larger engagements ships are grouped together in squadrons and usually form a &ldquo;Line of Battle&rdquo;, a formation that provides the commander with the most control over his fleet. Using Admiral's Order cards players signal general commands to their squadrons ranging from &quot;Form a Keel Line&quot; and &quot;Wearing in succession&quot; to &quot;Prepare for Close Action&quot;. Keeping the ships in formation and effectively deploying the fleet in the heat of battle while also retaining the initiative is the main challenge for a commander.<br/><br/>Occasionally, ships will engage each other in brutally destructive Close Quarter combat. In such situations the game 'zooms' into the action: Using a set of &quot;Close Action&quot; cards, players can employ grapeshot, grenades, carronades, and sharpshooters to wreak destruction on the opposing vessel&rsquo;s upper deck. Through a clever use of grappling hooks and boarding crews it is possible to overcome the enemy's defenses to take the ship as the ultimate prize.<br/><br/>All scenarios can be played by two players, but most also provide the option to split command between two players per side in the base game or four players using the Trafalgar expansion. Play time depends on the scenario. While an engagement between two frigates should last no more than two hours, fighting the whole Battle of Trafalgar will take up a weekend.<br/><br/>The game is produced in a small, limited edition and comes in a handcrafted linen-bound box, including a wooden presentation box with 74 (or 60) handcrafted, wooden ship models. Each ship comes with removable masts and ship names burned into each side.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Q4, players take the role of board game publishers, trying to make a name for themselves in the competitive world of hobby board games. The objective of the game is not necessarily to make the most money &ndash; although it helps &ndash; but to get the most satisfaction out of your career as a publisher by releasing the kind of games that you love.<br/>Over the course of a game players will seek funding and take out loans in order to license games from designers, hire artists and sell their games; boring parts of the process such as dealing with printers, shipping, warehousing and losing your house are abstracted away, but release deadlines are not!<br/><br/>Each game design a player licenses (a Contract) is placed onto that player&rsquo;s production schedule &ndash; the player must then source enough artwork to make that game before it hits its release date, as games which cannot be released on time get bad buzz and won&rsquo;t make them so much money. There are a limited number of artists working on board game art, however, so competition for art in particular styles can be fierce, and players will have to outbid their rivals to include it in their games.<br/><br/>In a game turn, players take turns to place their company's workers (discs) on the action spaces around the board. Some spaces function as traditional worker-placement action spaces and can be occupied only by a single disc at once. Other spaces - such as the artists or the game-design contract spaces - act as auctions; players place their discs on top of the stack of other discs already on the space, and once all discs have been placed, the players take turns from the top down to pay money equal to the number of discs in the stack if they want to commission art from that artist, or contract a game design from the submission queue. Players who place late pay the highest price but get first choice; players who place early could get a bargain, but only if nobody else outbids them for the thing they wanted.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, each player's catalogue of completed games sell to distributors and give him some income, but only a small number of games can be kept in print at any one time, and if a player's company has too much money in the bank the directors take the excess in dividends and blow it all on a weekend in Vegas.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players score each contract they've completed, getting bonus points if it aligns with their company's goals.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Generations is a collection of three games, also referred to as three &quot;generations&quot; (Discovery, Conquest and War). There are rules to play each game individually, but the set can be played in sequence as one long game, taking the players from the discovery of a new land, through colonization and industrialization, and finally to a bitter war for complete control of the land.<br/><br/>The first generation, Discovery takes about 45-60 minutes to play. You compete to grow your population while creating a unique map on which the other games will be played. Pieces are drawn at random, and different types of placements result in different &quot;scores&quot;. It is a relatively simple game of geometric strategy, along the lines of &quot;Dominoes,&quot; &quot;Carcassonne&quot; or &quot;Blokus&quot;. Your final score is based on how effectively and efficiently you &quot;discovered&quot; the land.<br/><br/>The second generation, Conquest takes about 60-90 minutes to play and is played on top of the map created by Generation One. This game is a race to colonize the map and build industries. You roll dice to determine where you can place your people on the board, or how you can impede your opponents. You trade in people from different land types to build industries. You can also build trade routes (allowing you to move people around) and  fortifications (to protect industries). You have to manage your assets wisely to win, but timing and luck play a role as well. The first player to achieve a &quot;stable society&quot; with four industries wins.<br/><br/>The third generation, War, also takes 60-90 minutes to play and is played from the end state of Generation Two. Your people have all become soldiers, trade routes are now blockades, and your industries are repurposed for the war effort. The basic mechanic for battle is similar to other world conquering games (like &quot;Risk&quot;) but your industries and blockades all have unique affects on the battlefield. Your armies can move and span across territories, resulting in a war that can ebb and flow to the very end.  The last remaining player is the winner.<br/><br/>The three games/generations are balanced in such a way to make it unlikely for a single player to win all three. And each generation uses different mechanics and different skills, allowing players of different types to engage with it.<br/><br/>",

First card is always revealed so your opponent can see it. In the first part of the ball flight, only important thing is that the ball cross over the net on the opponent's side of court. On that point your opponent can try to intercept your shot with volley, it is part of his judgement. The second card that, in combination with second die, determines second part of the shot is concealed from your opponent. That card tells which kind of shot did you choose (long shot, dropshot ....). In this part, most important thing for defending player, is to &quot;read opponent mind&quot; to anticipate wich shot  will he/she choose to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rocket Fist! Form Galaxy Sword! Omicron Torpedo, fire! Giant robots battle in the style of your favorite Japanese cartoons.<br/><br/>Duel Bots is a card game that lets you design a custom deck, load up your giant robot with high-tech components and devastating weapons, then duel head-to-head or in a multi-player death-match.<br/><br/>Duel packs contain two pre-constructed decks. Mix and match the cards to build hundreds of possible custom decks. Compatible with Galaxy Sword and all Duel Bots duel packs.<br/><br/>-- Game play summary --<br/><br/>Design your own deck of 32 cards or use a pre-constructed deck from the duel pack. There are three type of cards: components (such as weapons or other gear), resources (which focus on hand management) and damage cards. Damage cards go in a separate pile and you draw them when your robot takes damage. When your damage pile is empty, you lose.<br/><br/>Each turn you may put one component into play from your hand into one of 7 available slots. This sets the pace of the game. Components get more powerful as the game goes on: Tier I components can be played right away but aren't very powerful. You must have 3 components on the table to play a more powerful Tier II component. When 6 of the 7 slots are filled you can play your signature component. Each deck has exactly one signature component, and once they start hitting the table the game will end soon. This follows with the giant robot theme, where mega-weapons tend to decide the battle after some back and forth with smaller attacks.<br/><br/>Damage cards first go into available component slots; you can't play a new component into a damaged slot. You may also put damage on a component on the table, which keeps you from using that component until the damage is removed. Some cards let you move damage to the discard pile where it will eventually cycle back into your hand, so that's just a temporary fix. One card (Repair Bot) moves damage back into your damage pile at the cost of some resources, but in many cases you will need to pay the cost listed on the damage card to remove it from the game. There are 5 different kinds of damage with 5 different costs, so choosing compatible damage cards is an important part of deck design. You also choose how many damage cards to use (8 to 12) but the total is always 32 cards, so choosing more &quot;hit points&quot; reduces your available number of components and resource cards.<br/><br/>The game has elements that limit the luck factor present in all card games. Certain resources let you choose cards from your discard pile, others from your draw pile. The small deck size ensures you will see your whole draw pile several times each game. (The discard pile shuffles to form a new draw pile when it's exhausted.) Luck plays a factor in which components come out first and in occasionally finding yourself without a component to play which can put you a turn behind.<br/><br/>",

Players attempt to outperform each nation&rsquo;s historical record in the world&rsquo;s most gigantic struggle. The game starts in 1935 and ends by an automatic victory or in the summer of 1945.<br/><br/>Shadows of Europe is played over 11 years, 1935-1945. Each year is represented by three turns; a Between Years turn (diplomacy, resource collection and research), a Winter turn (land operations), and a Summer turn (land and naval operations). Further each turn is divided into several phases.<br/><br/>A fundamental part of the game design is that actions rather than units are hidden from the enemy. This captures the game&rsquo;s ambition to reflect a strategic rather than tactical level. In WWII the concentration of larger forces was often known to the enemy, whereas their strategic intent was not.<br/><br/>Units are Infantry and Mechanized/Panzer armies, Leaders, Surface raiders, U-boat flotillas, Escort Groups and Convoys. Air forces are abstracted to a combat modifier for each front.<br/><br/>The game facilitates two kind of resources: Minerals used for production and Oil for operations.<br/><br/>Rulebook and Playbook:<br/>The 20-page rulebook is clearly written with many examples and designer notes. Also included is a 14-page playbook with extended examples of play, strategy hints and a card index.<br/><br/>",

Once these are placed, the players draw and play cards to attack and defend against other Hunters as they move their toy around the table for position and opportunity; where you attack from is as important as what you attack with!<br/><br/>Game play continues until one Hunter is left standing, but be warned: As players take and inflict damage, unique character abilities are enabled which can turn the tide of the game. When the game is over, all the components fit back inside the head while the toy sits patiently (and attractively) on your shelf, waiting for its next opponent.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>After some months of quiet, Europe&rsquo;s &ldquo;soft underbelly&rdquo; became a brutal theater of war in 1940 when Italy joined the Axis. Italian convoys fought their way south across the Mediterranean, while British convoys tried to cross the Middle Sea from west to east. Each, in turn, tried to stop the other and claim control of these troubled waters.<br/><br/>La Regia Marina is a complete Second World War at Sea boxed game based on the Mediterranean Campaign of 1939 through 1944. It covers the valiant convoy defenses of both sides, such as Operation Pedestal. Battleship clashes like Cape Teulada or the Italian disaster at Cape Matapan. Carrier raids like Taranto. Impossible fights against terrible odds, such as the night battle in which the Italian torpedo boat Lupo took on and defeated three British cruisers.<br/><br/>La Regia Marina includes almost 1,000 silky-smooth, die-cut playing pieces representing the ships and aircraft of Italy, Britain, Germany, France, Yugoslavia, Greece and the United States that fought in the campaign. Two 22x28-inch maps include all of the Mediterranean and Black Sea basins and out a little ways into the Atlantic.<br/><br/>There are over 75 scenarios, organized in our popular &ldquo;story arc&rdquo; format that weaves the narrative of the campaign into the scenarios, allowing them to tell the story of this pivotal series of battles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kort p&aring; kanten (&quot;Card on the edge&quot;) is a shameless party game in norwegian, where the purpose is to make funny, absurd and unfitting combinations of words, phrases, persons and situations.<br/>To generalize, it's the norwegian version of Cards against humanity, with some new rules.<br/><br/>Play begins with a judge, choosing a red question or fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players. Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the judge, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The judge determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an point, and then the player to the left of the new judge becomes the judge for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most points (red cards) is the winner.<br/><br/>In addition there are some new rules:<br/>&quot;Bestemor&quot; (gradma) - draw an extra white card from the draw pile. If that card wins, agree on a punishment.<br/>&quot;Sidesprang&quot; (side step) - before you read the white cards, draw another red card and use that instead.<br/>&quot;Kapitalisme&quot; (capitalism) - discard one of the red point cards you have won to &quot;punish&quot; other players or switch 3 white cards.<br/>&quot;Folkestyre&quot; (democracy) - Judges are stupid! Everone can vote. The card with most votes win!<br/>&quot;Samspill&quot; (Interaction) - Too many players? Team up with more people on each team.<br/><br/>From the publisher (translated):<br/>&quot;Kort p&aring; kanten is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike 4.0 license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it...&quot;<br/><br/>",

Real-life Genetically Modified Organisms are intermingled with bizarre, advanced innovations to create a card game filled with laughs, debate, and fantasy.<br/><br/>G.M.O.ooh!&rsquo;s key game mechanic involves debating the merits of the futuristic Organisms across a many of dimensions.  These unique factors lead to one-of-a-kind, creative discussions.  Only one G.M.O.ooh! Card survives per round.  The player with the last remaining G.M.O.ooh! Card wins the game.<br/><br/>Each G.M.O.ooh! Card is a futuristic genetically modified organism, including background information and data on 5 Categories.  Each Category has a Description and a Rating number.  The Categories are Profit, Cost, Environmental Impact, Demand, and Risk.<br/><br/>Each Challenge Card allows a player to Challenge and overtake the Current Leader.  Red Challenge Cards involve adding or subtracting Rating points or changing the Category.  Blue Challenge Cards allow the player to debate the Current Leader across 11 Debate types: Category Challenge (5 different Categories), Survive, Mate, Sales Pitch, Danger, Act, Fight, Outsmart, Race, Outgrow, and Looks.<br/><br/>This description primarily covers the Basic Game.  The full details of the Advanced Game version are included in the instruction booklet.<br/><br/>Setup: Deal all of the G.M.O.ooh! Cards face down to each player.  This is the players Stack.  Players do not look at the cards in their stack until the top card is played.  Deal 3 Challenge Cards to each player face down.  Players can hold and view their Challenge Cards and also replenish up to 3 after each round.  The Dealer starts with the Current Leader Dial and the Dealer Button.  The Current Leader Dial acts as a scorekeeper for the Category and Rating within the current round and also denotes who the Current Leader is.<br/><br/>Each round within a game includes 2 phases: G.M.O.ooh! Card phase and Challenge Card phase.<br/><br/>G.M.O.ooh! Card phase &ndash; This phase establishes the Current Leader.  The dealer introduces the G.M.O.ooh! Card, choses a Category, and states the Rating.  All players then reveal their Rating in that Category.  The player with the highest rating in the Category chosen becomes the Current Leader and announces their Card if necessary.<br/><br/>Challenge Card Phase &ndash; Starting clockwise, the Current Leader then Checks for Challenges.  Players can then play a Challenge Card to attempt to become the new Current Leader.  There is a limit of 1 Challenge per player per round.<br/><br/>Red Challenge Cards may result in an immediate change of Current Leader.<br/><br/>Blue Challenge Cards require a debate.  The Challenger first states their case, the Current Leader then defends.  A final phase allows all players at the table to ask questions or lobby before all players vote.<br/><br/>Voters should consider creative use of data provided on each G.M.O.ooh! Card when casting their vote.<br/><br/>The Challenger must have at least 1 extra vote (A tie goes to the Current Leader).  The Challenge Phase then continues clockwise until all players have had 1 chance to Challenge.  A feature in the Advanced Game version allows players to pass and still Challenge in the same round.<br/><br/>The Current Leader when all challenges have been exhausted or one full pass around the table has been completed wins the round and moves their G.M.O.ooh! Card to their Winners Pile.  All losers in the round discard their G.M.O.ooh! Card to the Losers Pile in the center of the table.  In the Advanced Game version, players can Steal or Re-incarnate lost G.M.O.ooh! Cards using Yellow Challenge Cards.<br/><br/>Pass the Dealer Button to the left and continue with a new round.  When a player&rsquo;s Stack is depleted, their shuffled Winners Pile becomes their new Stack.  A player is out of the game when they lose their last G.M.O.ooh! Card.<br/><br/>The player with the last remaining G.M.O.ooh! Card wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>You and your fellow adventurers have completed what you thought was a typical dungeon crawl. With the dungeon cleared and boss defeated, the treasure is yours for the taking... or so you thought. There's a disagreement as to who gets what. Talking leads to arguing. Arguing leads to yelling. Suddenly, there's a twinkle of light and a flash of steel. Everyone reactively jumps back, weapons at the ready. Each person eyes the other as they all stare back knowingly. There's no turning back now. It's now become a Dungeon Brawl.<br/><br/>Dungeon Brawl is a customizable, take-that, free for all for 3 to 5 players. In this 30 to 60 minute game, players draft 1 of 5 classes then customize it by constructing a deck consisting of weapons, armor, items, and abilities. Draft your treasure, then drop into the dungeon with your so-called &quot;friends&quot;. Your cards determine what actions you can take. Deal out damage in order to give your opponents Wounds. Wounds are added to your deck when it runs out, slowing you down by impeding your hand size. Traps will effect the dungeon every round, helping, but mostly hindering you. Once the Wound deck runs out, the game ends and the adventurer with the least amount of Wounds takes all the treasure and is declared the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arkham Knight is the first campaign supplement for the Batman Miniature Game. This 132-page, full-colour book is the ultimate toolbox for devising, organizing and running your own campaigns with your friends, transforming your games from one-off encounters to a series of linked adventures, where every result counts towards ultimate victory or crushing defeat.<br/><br/><br/>What is a Campaign?<br/><br/>At its most basic, a campaign is simply a series of linked battles between two or more players. The result of each game has an effect on the next, giving the winner an advantage in the later stages of the campaign. Inside the Arkham Knight Campaign book, you&rsquo;ll find rules and guidelines for creating and running campaigns &ndash; taking your one-shot games and instead playing a series of linked scenarios, with ultimate victory coming to the crew that achieves its long-term goals. Everything from organizing a campaign to forming alliances or playing multiplayer games is covered, making this your one-stop source of campaign material.<br/><br/><br/>Not only that, but within these pages you will find a complete, ready-to-run narrative campaign, recreating the Arkham Knight saga from the thrilling finale of Rocksteady&rsquo;s Arkham trilogy, and giving you the chance to save or destroy Gotham City. Want to see what would happen if the Arkham Knight defeated Batman? Or if the Scarecrow became the most powerful crime-lord in Gotham? Now&rsquo;s your chance! Every scenario in the campaign also comes with suggestions for alternative participants &ndash; so even if you don&rsquo;t have the right models to play the Arkham Knight storyline, you can still play the campaign with the models in your collection. You can even use the scenarios as standalone ones if you want to, adding even more variety to your games!<br/><br/><br/>Is it Just About Campaigns, Then?<br/><br/>Not quite. While much of the book is geared towards campaign play (as you&rsquo;d expect), you&rsquo;ll also find some awesome new rules that you can use in your regular games. Want to play a Predator Mode game, where a single hero stealthily takes down a mob of Henchmen? Now you can. Want to play four, five, or six-player games? We got you covered. Want character cards for a whole host of vehicles, including Batmobile variants, GCPD vans and Rattler Drones? Look no further.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you still needed an incentive to order this tome, there&rsquo;s a chance to get your hands on a limited edition Arkham Knight model, with three different head variants, while stocks last.<br/><br/><br/>&ldquo;Tonight Ends with Gotham&rsquo;s Fall&hellip;.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

If found, the Artifacts can release the Elders who will fight one last time to return Cthluhu to his submerged stone-city where his nightmares can no longer harm humanity.  <br/>To fight the Wardens&rsquo; armies and stop them from finding the Artifacts, Cthulhu and his powerful Starspawns will spread madness, turning the Wardens &quot;Insane&quot; and converting them to play against each-other.<br/><br/>Gameplay: <br/>One player will be taking the role of Cthluhu and control his Starspawns minions as they rise across the world and fight the Warden's armies. Cthulhu's Gameplay is focused in strategic movements and unit placement. The Great Old One travels through various portals across the map and spreading madness, he corrupts the Wardens at his will, forcing the insane player to fight against his allies. <br/>Every time The Wardens perish in battle, Cthulhu grows stronger and uses the defeated army&rsquo;s power to raise his legion with his mutation tree.<br/><br/>1-3 players are the Wardens, each controlling their own steam-powered army over land, water and sky. The vehicles can be upgraded with hidden Blueprints in order to take control of territories, fight Starspawns, call for reinforcement and go on Expedition, in search for Artifacts.<br/><br/>Each Warden has their own characteristics, abilities and strategies, each presenting a unique gameplay experience and adding a lot of replay-value to the game. Since their actions are so different, they must absolutely work in coalition if they want to survive. <br/>They must use their special abilities, spend distinct free actions, unique masteries and designated pet companion skills to fight the enemy's legion.<br/><br/>Battles in Wardens are diceless. Instead, opponents will engage in a strategic mini-game to read each other's mind by tossing Strategy Battle Coins using a battle pyramid mechanic deciding your fate.<br/><br/>Wardens also includes different mechanics such as Prophecy and Ability cards which add yet another dynamic to gameplay.<br/><br/>During the Co-op and Solo Scenarios, the Wardens will fight against the Game as Cthulhu's actions will be automated.<br/><br/>Will the Wardens prove strong enough to prevail against Cthulhu, or will humanity be lost to madness?<br/><br/>History:<br/>The annals of prehistory describe a time of peace and unprecedented enlightenment and creativity lead by a mysterious earthly race called, the Naacal.  <br/>A hostile and cosmic family of entities lead by Cthulhu invaded the world seeking to usurp the Naacal&rsquo;s power and send humanity into madness.  <br/>The Naacal Elders, with the aid of powerful Artifacts contained Cthulhu and his Starspawn, entombing him in a Stone-city where he sleeps to this day at the bottom of the ocean, forgotten in history.<br/>The Elders retreat, allowing the world to set its own future but not before establishing a Naacalean bloodline of guardians to watch and defend, known as The Brotherhood.  The most powerful and trained of these guardians were known as Wardens, sworn to keep vigil over the cosmic threat that slumbers beneath the world through their superhuman ability and with the power of the Artifacts.<br/>Thousands of years later an unearthed scroll warns of Cthulhu&rsquo;s return to seek vengeance on the Naacal and humanity itself &ndash; that warning comes to pass as an awakening Cthulhu spreads his tentacles across the world, this time imprisoning the Naacal Elders.  The Brotherhood is left in ruins as the world falls to madness and burns.<br/>Time is running out for humanity&rsquo;s remnant and only our three remaining Wardens stand between Cthulhu freely roaming the world and humanity becoming enslaved to his madness.<br/><br/>",

Making use of what they can, players will attempt to survive each day while searching to discover a way back to civilization. A single player may play as Nature, influencing the weather, wildlife, and special events that the other players must endure throughout the game.<br/><br/>The Great Wide Open is an Asymmetrical Competitive and Cooperative Survive and Escape board game. <br/>Each passing day is an opportunity for Nature to shift the environment that the Survivors attempt to progress in. Survivors will explore and discover resources, items, and special events allowing each game to form its own story. Triggered by in-game events, a Salvation Card will be drawn that describes how the Survivors can get back home. If the Survivors can fulfill the requirements of the card, the game is won. If they die in the progress, Nature prevails.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Make your enemies your friends and your friends your enemies as you jostle to be the first one served! What could be more fun than actually waiting in line? Playing a game about waiting in line!<br/><br/>Out of Line: Food Trucks is a take-that party game for 2-6 players that plays in 15-20 minutes. To start, set-up your food trucks and make some lines. Once the initial lines are formed with foodies, the players add themselves to the back of the line. Then the game is simply a backstabbing race to the front of the line and be the first player to be served completely. Out of Line: Food Trucks is a blend of strategic positioning, card play, and pure dumb luck, where you shouldn't be afraid to cut in line or use distractions to your favor.<br/><br/>A player's turn consists of 3 easy steps:<br/>    1. Roll a dice and move that line up <br/>    2. Take an action (play a card, move to the back of a line or just discard a card)<br/>    3.  Draw your hand back up to three cards<br/>    <br/>Player cards allow you to do things like:<br/>    &bull; Move a player to the end of a line<br/>    &bull; Force a player out of line<br/>    &bull; Let a foodie cut into the front of the line<br/>    &bull; Add a food(ies) to the end of a line<br/>    &bull; Temporarily close down a food truck<br/>    &bull; Stop another player from playing a card<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It doesn't matter if you are a neighborhood hooligan, a world-famous sports personage or an elderly lady skilled in gardening, THE TOWN NEEDS YOU!<br/><br/>In UAZG, each player plays an inhabitant of a small town hit by a zombie outbreak. The aim of the game is to reach the rescue teams, which appear after a certain number of game turns, depending on the number of players; very difficult mission without the character upgrade, an upgrade that can be obtained by completing the missions that will be available during the game.<br/><br/>UAZG is a Semi-Cooperative Zombie Game, this is because during the game you will have to cooperate to survive, but at the moment of the arrival of the rescuers maybe someone could have the brilliant idea of caring about the companions and saving the skin, since the rescuers will not have time to wait too long among thousands of zombies.<br/>The game is based on the Pick-Up &amp; Delivery mechanics and it will be essential to cooperate to complete the missions that will advance the 'Game Time'. Not doing any mission during a turn means advancing the 'Danger Marker' by a space that will lead after a few turns to fail and lose the game.<br/>During the game there will be the level increases that will enhance the character of your choice and there will be the possibility of crafting useful objects or weapons, managing inventory better.

        "description": "Knyghte Pyke and Sworde is a set of miniatures gaming rules for &quot;mass skirmish&quot; games ranging from 4-5 figures on each side up to battles with 30-40 figures each.<br/><br/>As the name suggests, the rules are intended for dark age through medieval battles though I have included provisions for early firearms as well.<br/><br/>The game play is simple and straight-forward, allowing you to focus on the drama unfolding instead of digging through the rulebook every 17 seconds. <br/>The rules are strictly 1 figure equals 1 combatant, meaning the game is about raids, skirmishes and patrols. The stuff where we get to know each soldier and naming our heroes matter.<br/><br/>Core game mechanics include:<br/><br/>     Alternating turn sequence.<br/>     Opposed rolls between individual figures for hand to hand combat and a straight roll vs target number for missile combat.<br/>     Injury rolls and morale checks are both taken by rolling 2 dice and seeing how many dice roll over a target number (meaning instead of troops always being okay or dead/routed, we have a third option as well)<br/>     As exhausted troops are vulnerable to close combat, counter-attacking can help turn the tide after an enemy charge.<br/>     Each troop type receives a straight forward mechanic allowing them to be differentiated on the table. Chargers are powerful on the attack while Polearm troops can engage horsemen more effectively. 7 base troop types are included.<br/>     3 types of individual figure is included: Scouts that can be used for delaying in the turn sequence, fighters are mighty with a sword while captains can inspire your soldiers to enhanced actions.<br/><br/><br/>Of course no Nordic Weasel game would be complete without some extra goodies including:<br/><br/>     Advice and mechanics for playing on a big map.<br/>     Campaign rules with simple experience and casualty mechanics.<br/>     Tables to award your leaders with rewards and to grant advantages and drawbacks to future battles.<br/>     A weather table.<br/>     Points values to build your own troops.<br/>     A scenario system to set up a battle with multiple ways to play.<br/><br/><br/>The game can be played with any individually mounted figures. You can get started with as little as 4 miniatures each, with a typical game being about 20-40. If you have existing armies, odds are you can dive right in. If you don't, you won't need to buy very much.<br/><br/>The game was written with figures from 15-28mm in mind. 6mm and 10mm skirmish is gaining in popularity. Players should simply take all measurements and read them as centimeters instead (so 5&quot; becomes 5 cm).<br/><br/>Solo mechanics are not specifically included, though the game is fairly easy to solo.<br/><br/>As the mechanics are very simple, this is also a good choice for resolving battles in your RPG campaign.<br/><br/>Fantasy rules are not specifically included at this time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Messerschmitt Me 262 was the first operational jet-powered fighter aircraft in the world. Though design work began well before the commencement of World War II, problems with development - from the engines to interference from the highest command levels mean that the aircraft did not reach operational status until mid-1944, too late to make the required impact. The Me 262 was more heavily armed than and outperformed every Allied aircraft in terms of speed. It served in a number of roles such as light-bomber, reconnaissance and experimental night fighter. It earned nicknames dependant on its role, dubbed Schwalbe (German for swallow) in fighter versions, or Sturmvogel (German for storm bird) in fighter-bomber versions.<br/><br/>Though war records are sketchy pilots of the Me 262 claimed more than 542 Allied aircraft downed. Its phenomenal speed made it an extremely difficult target to intercept, however at lower speeds the 262 suffered from diminished performance due to the limitations of thrust provided by the early jet engine. Allied pilots soon learned to take advantage of this trait by attacking the aircraft at its most vulnerable during take-off and landing. Whilst airborne, Me 262 pilots were relatively safe from Allied aircraft provided they did not get drawn into low-speed manoeuvring contests.<br/><br/>In targeting enemy bombers, new tactics needed to be developed. Head-on attacks would not work, as the closing speed did not pair well with the rate of fire of the mounted Mk 108 cannons. When engaging bombers, Me 262 pilots developed a 'broadside' attack approach.<br/><br/>The effect of the 262 on the outcome of the war was compromised by its late entry. By 1944, German armament production had shifted to more easily producible, and cheaper aircraft. Only a small number of Me 262s saw service, with reportedly only a maximum of 200 operating at any one time. Nevertheless, the aircraft influenced post-war military jet development, captured examples being extensively tested by the post-war major powers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

RTG plays great as the base game, but adding subs creates an exciting new dynamic to really get the adrenaline pumping.<br/><br/>Firstly we have the Star players. Two full teams of them! These guys are on another level, with better stats and a few player-specific abilities that give them the edge. The overall gameplay is still pretty balanced, but played right, you know when these guys are on the field!<br/><br/>The players can only come on when you use one of your substitution cards (generally 5 in a game). These cards have rules which dictate when they can be used, and are determined by points-difference, total points scored, game stage (such as &quot;play at half time&quot;), and such. Also, the player is randomly selected (with the subs card dictating &quot;Forward&quot; or &quot;Back&quot; deck only), so you don't know who you will get.

        "description": "&quot;It is insane that two men, sitting on opposite sides of the world, should be able to decide to bring an end to civilization.&ldquo; -John F. Kennedy<br/><br/>The Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 seems almost like &lsquo;ancient history&rsquo; now, as we approach it being  60 years after the event. Yet, it marks one of the two or three times the world literally stood on the brink of total annihilation. But the dramatic side of our nature always focuses on the ultimately bad outcome&mdash;nuclear devastation on a global scale. When things got hot in Cuba, professional military planners on both sides were preparing for a very different kind of war&mdash;an &ldquo;old fashioned&rdquo; kind (mostly) with conventional air, land, and naval units struggling for local supremacy.  What if that had happened?<br/><br/>We Are All Mortal gives players a chance to work on both aspects of the confrontation. Full-sized playing cards are used to simulate the diplomatic, intelligence, and pre-invasion deployments of combat forces, and determination of random events once war breaks out (if it does.)<br/><br/>There is a &ldquo;Pre-war&rdquo; phase of card play, unit placement, preparation, recon, and diplomacy. It is possible that the game will end without serious shots being exchanged, and players must jockey for position to &ldquo;win&rdquo; the game right there.  But, if the &ldquo;historical result&rdquo; does not take place, then things shift to a shooting war&mdash;but a limited, conventional war. Unit activation by chit-draw keeps things fluid, and both players work for a tactical victory, keeping one eye on the U.N.&mdash;who might stop the fighting before your side wants that to happen&mdash;and another eye watching the &ldquo;Doomsday Clock,&rdquo; because if a full nuclear war breaks out, both sides lose.  Players walk a tightrope as they compete for both Military Victory Points and Diplomatic Victory Points, even after the shooting starts. There are special rules for B-52 strikes, tactical nukes, and Fidel Castro, with optional rules for Special Forces units.<br/><br/>CONTENTS<br/>233 playing pieces<br/>Mounted map <br/>64 cards <br/>12 pages of rules plus charts<br/><br/>-description from artist<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Within the turbulent plane of Astraea, peace is a fleeting dream. Wars rage, tragedy strikes, and the battlefield becomes a canvas of strategy and power. Amidst the chaos, commanders rise, guiding their troops through a dance of tactical prowess, seeking victory by morale or complete annihilation. As a player, you'll immerse yourself in this intricate dance, orchestrating your forces' movements, launching attacks, assembling versatile constructs, and leveraging unique formations to create devastating combos. Each decision carries weight, as the path to triumph requires both foresight and adaptability.<br/><br/>Astraea: The Seraphim Paradox invites two players into a strategic skirmish on a grid-based battlefield. Armed with a meticulously crafted faction of 20 cards - comprising 10 units, 6 constructs, and 4 formations - players are given the choice of deploying units for a robust offensive or holding some back for greater command flexibility. More troops on the field might amplify your battle presence, but holding onto cards can increase your available actions. Success hinges on strategic foresight and timely decisions.<br/><br/>With its initial release, Astraea: The Seraphim Paradox provides an ever-rich tapestry of lore and strategy, featuring five distinct factions. The &quot;Shields of Genmar&quot; stand as the stalwart defenders of the capital city's ideals, ever-ready to lay down their lives for the realm. Opposing them are &quot;The Risen,&quot; Genmarian rebels who've embraced forbidden magics to challenge the very fabric of their world. Meanwhile, the &quot;Seraphim Kestral's,&quot; sky-toned enigmas from beyond, bring with them a paradox that not only fractured the realm but thrust them into this relentless war. New contenders await your discovery... Choose your allegiance, and let the battle to restore Astraea begin!<br/><br/>",

A combination of tactical RPG and adventure, Factions carries on the tradition of intensity and uniqueness. Two decades have proven that you've never played a game like this.<br/><br/>Two teams of heroes from past, present, and future descend into the Worldspanner Arena and compete to earn the most glory by acts of renown--and by facing down the enemy. Earn the alliance of one of the six factions, or the queen mother of the Games. For 2-8 players who divide into two teams. In effect, a co-op game with excellent opponent AI (unless your friends dump-statted INT).<br/><br/>The teams take turns, conducting an action with each hero--move, attack, unleash a minion. This is followed by reactions from the opposing team, after which the current team conducts adventures. Play continues for 9 or 12 turns, after which objective points are tallied. Most objective points are earned from non-combat activities such as alliances with the different factions.<br/><br/>Contains 49 heroes, 90 treasures and a selection of map pieces, making each play different--new teams gathering new treasure on a completely new map. Expansions bring both the treasure count and the hero count up to 360--The Full Degree.<br/><br/>With a ruleset significantly streamlined from Duel of Ages, Factions has half the rules word count of Duel of Ages I and over a third less than DoA II. Factions is now a game system capable of pulling in a universe of heroes (and their miniatures).<br/><br/>",

Our Tale about Invasion takes us right to the Eye of Zamrock, or how people there call it - &lsquo;the Eye&rsquo;.<br/><br/>It is now nearing the end of the Eight Age after the Becoming and by surprise, the Demon King was slain while trying to set hold in the Eye. This left his younger brother Lorial unattained and a new King of Demon Realm. The New King's lust for vengeance and hatred against all life pushed him to force open a portal in the middle of the Eye at the Crystal Lake Iris.<br/><br/>It was in this dark hour that the almost forgotten prophecy was unearthed. It speaks of one Kingdom that will rise above all others and build a Crystal Tower that will shine the light which will destroy the invaders and cast its beam to discover the Truth that will save the Eye and free all.<br/><br/>But the the prophecy brought hope as much as the divide, for Kings&rsquo; ambitions extend beyond the current conflict, as each one hopes to emerge from the war as the strongest ruler, worthy of uniting Zamrock under a single banner.<br/><br/>There are many paths to victory, but not all lead to saving the world. Become the leader of one of Six Kingdoms of the Eye and balance your relationship with other players and your ulterior motives to become the leading Kingdom in order to attain the most victory points. Command your Kingdom where you build up your city, armies, equip your Hero through quests, and expand with your Emissary and fight Demon forces who have built a Portal in the iris of the world to destroy everything. There are five different areas in which your Kingdom can gain influence - Battle, Trade, Build, Quest and Colonization. Enough influence points allow you to acquire crystals needed to construct Crystal Tower.<br/><br/>Demons win if any of the Kingdoms fail to build their Crystal Tower to level three by the end of the 24th Turn of play. If the Tower is built, demon Portal closes and a celebratory Tournament is held. Kingdom with the most EOZ Medals, in the end, wins the game.<br/><br/>Be advised, straying too much from the path of stopping the invasion can make everything you do to expand your Kingdom futile.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The scenarios span the entire length of the war, starting with the first American counterattacks in the Gap and desperate efforts to slow down the Soviet juggernaut. We see Soviet Separate Air battalions landing to clear the way for armored spearheads and vicious ambushes against columns of Soviet vehicles.<br/><br/>There are armored formations clashing outside of Frankfurt. We see the French desperately attempting to hold the Soviets at bay in bitter fighting on the streets of Paris and daring rear area raids on supply depots, and the combined NATO last desperate final attempt to stop the Soviet Black Guards Tank Division from reaching Le Havre, and splitting the NATO line from north and south France.<br/><br/>",

All 4 participants play against each other. Again, it's about pushing the opponents off the board and trying to get to the middle of the game by advancing and thus winning. However, the board is designed in a completely different way: You now have a square board, which has a slope in the middle and ups and downs distributed over the board, creating natural &quot;safety bunkers&quot;. In the beginning you can only hit the outermost discs of your neighbors directly, for everything else you have to make use of the round peg in the center of the board, and cleverly and accurately calculate the rebound.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The game retains the basic elements of Kriegsspiel that make the game so remarkable, such as double-blind play, umpired, simultaneous resolution of orders, delayed order implementation, dispatch transmission, and emphasis on fog of war.<br/><br/>The game is simple and easy to learn, and features modifications for two-player play. Its complexity is between 1867 Kriegsspiel and Free Kriegsspiel.<br/><br/>Play takes place on a scaled map with pieces that represent the space formations would occupy on the battlefield. Typically, three maps are used, and play proceeds in double-blind fashion, facilitated by an umpire, but two-player play on a single map is also possible.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by die rolls and consulting a CRT, although results may be modified by the umpire at their reasoned discretion.<br/><br/>",

What was intended as a diversion to keep the Chinese from interfering with the Japanese attack on Hong Kong became a major operation of its own. The six Chinese armies (each the size of a small Western corps, with very little artillery and no armor) of the IX War Zone met the Eastern Sea Demons and drove them back, nearly encircling 11th Army and causing a general retreat.<br/><br/>Changsha Operation comes with 88 new pieces and eight new scenarios, all based on this crucial World War Two battle. It introduces the Chinese National Revolutionary Army (the central government&rsquo;s army) to the Panzer Grenadier series; they have lots of infantry, some mortar and machine-gun platoons, and not much else. Artillery was held at army level; the Chinese divisions at Changsha had none of their own.<br/><br/>Panzer Grenadier: Changsha Operation is a free download; you&rsquo;ll have to assemble the pieces yourself. The Japanese come from The Kokoda Campaign (we also included them as a download), and the maps from Korean War: Pusan Perimeter and Korean War: Counter Attack.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

The aim is to reach the cafe WITH someone (yes, anyone), rather than reaching first alone. However, players' cards are hidden, so everyone uses vague Status Updates to communicate, leading to confusion and laughter.<br/><br/>Over a set of 5 quick games, the winner is the player who reaches the cafe WITH friends the most number of times. So... Make friends, betray them, even bluff a little... Do whatever it takes to win!<br/><br/>Fun surprise: The comic-style artwork on the cards depicts funny situations on India's roads...like a cow sitting in the middle of the road, or people dancing on the road as part of a marriage procession (baraat).

        "description": "Have you ever wanted to fall in love at a very legitimate and not-at-all-sketchy art university? In the year 19XX, Johnathan Dromathan invented Art. It went well. He then used the funds to open up the first art academy, which you - the player - are attending...just to ignore your education in the pursuit of &quot;love.&quot;<br/><br/>GOAL<br/><br/>Romance the group's love interest of choice by gaining the most affection via end of game cards, maximizing stats, and successfully beating the romantic interest's current affection threshold.<br/><br/>GAMPEPLAY<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, 2-4 players each agree upon a game mode and love interest, placing their pawns in the center of the map on the Quad space. Each player gets a player mat and 8 stat trackers to place on the corresponding stat track. Players then take turns rolling the movement dice and moving that many spaces landing on one of several different type of spaces, skipping over spaces that have players already occupying them.<br/><br/>- Trait increase space: this will increase one of the 7 different types of traits<br/>- Action card space: this allows a player to draw the top card of the action deck and add it to their hand.<br/>- Event space: this space allows a player to reveal the top card of the event deck and resolve one of three possible effects based off the required stat(s).<br/>- Trait Buildings: These buildings allow multiple players to land on them, and players can choose to stop early if they can reach it with less moves than the die allows. When a player ends their turn in one, the corresponding trait is increased by 1.<br/>- Romance Buildings: Similar to trait buildings, except there is no stat increase, but these are the only buildings a love interest will be in.<br/><br/>Before ending their move on a non-building space, a player puts their colored tile over that space, taking the reward and stopping any future uses of that space.<br/><br/>Once per day if a trait is at rank 2 or higher, a player can use its special perk ability if the trigger is activated. The traits and their perks are:<br/><br/>- Charm: If you roll a 1 on your movement roll, you may use this perk and treat the result as a 3 instead.<br/>- Kindness: If you land on a space that has already been claimed, you may use this perk and reveal the space and claim the reward, leaving the player tile as it was afterwards.<br/>- Brawn: If you would land on a space occupied by another player, instead of jumping over them, you may use this perk and send them back to the Quad instead.<br/>- Smarts: When you reveal an Event card, you may use this perk to discard it and draw again taking the new result.<br/>- Tenacity: If another player rolls a 6, you may use this perk and immediately move one space, taking any rewards as normal.<br/>- Humor: If you would draw one or more action cards, you may use this perk to draw another action card.<br/>- Mojo (1): After you roll the affection die, you may use this perk to re-roll it taking the new result.<br/>- Mojo (2): After rolling the movement die during an affection roll, you may use this perk to re-roll it.<br/><br/>(Note: Mojo has two perks which can each be used once per day)<br/><br/>Furthermore during the course of the day, once per day players that enter the same building as their love interest may attempt an affection roll. First the player takes the affection die and rolls it. Each side has a 1, 2, 3, or combination of those numbers, indicating which of the love interests favored stats will be added to the roll. Then they take the movement die and roll it, adding the stat(s) used with the movement die and getting their total affection roll. If this number beats the love interest's affection threshold for the day, they succeed and move the affection track up one space gaining two affection points.<br/><br/>Each love interest has 3 different favored traits, one of which is their most favorite, a schedule that changes what building they are in each day, an increasing affection threshold to beat, and a unique quirk. Quirks affect any players that are romantically pursuing the love interest - some in positive ways and some in negative ways.<br/><br/>Play continues clockwise until all players have taken their 5th turn. The players are moved back to the Quad and the love interest changes building based of their unique schedule. The new round then starts and play continues as normal for 4 more rounds. After the 5th turn of the 5th round, play ends and 1 bonus card per player is revealed, each with a sub goal awarding 2 affection points to the player who best completes the criteria. In case of a tie, all players tied are awarded full points. Players then add 2 affection for each successful affection roll they made during the course of the game, and 1 more affection for each of stat that is at rank 4 except for Mojo.<br/><br/>The player with the most affection is the winner of the game and the love interest's heart!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Explorers of Terra Fauna is a deckbuilding/troop-management and engine building game that takes place on a distant sci-fi world far in the future, where various animal and insect creatures have evolved to inherit a world abandoned by the &ldquo;Ancient Giants&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Players curate decks around one or more of the main archetypes - Nature, Technology, Beetles and Lizogs. They will use their action, day, and creature cards to explore and travel between the two main market zones - the Wild and Edge. The Wild is a safer place, with less risk and easier engine building opportunities, but fewer ways to generate or gain victory points. The Edge, on the other hand, is a vicious and dangerous place, but every card offers either inherent victory points, ways to generate them, or offer an additional endgame scoring condition for the player.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, the players will find that they have ventured perhaps a little too far, and terrifying Superpredators will enter the Edge deck as future Edge cards enter the market row face-down. Stumbling across a Superpredator will cause every player in the Edge to be ambushed by an incredible, devastating attack. Defeating even a single Superpredator will grant a player great renown - and lots of victory points!<br/><br/>In addition to a player's turn having card plays and cleanup, the game progresses over several 'days', three-round periods where players will build their board states and prepare to fight stronger opposition. When night falls, players will discard their Day cards and Creature cards and begin again.<br/><br/>Additionally, after the first day, there is an Event each day that offers a minigame for players to compete or participate for earning additional victory points, and at the end of the game, three Fame cards with unique objectives will be scored with the winners taking their points.<br/><br/>The game progresses along an escalation track - it advances on its own every day, but exploring the Edge will accelerate its progression. When it completes the game will end at the end of the day, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

During this time the new regime became increasingly alienated from the US, began to grow closer to the Soviet Union, and faced internal dissent from several sectors of Cuban society. The main expansion game charts the processes and actors that shaped Cuba during this period of struggle, with four players controlling either the new revolutionary Government, US-backed attempts to destabilise and overthrow the government, the growing Soviet influence and eventually military presence on the island, or the urban and rural Resistance to the revolution.<br/><br/>Highlights include:<br/><br/>     An entirely new four-player COIN game, Resisting Revolution, that tells the story of the consolidation of Castro&rsquo;s government from 1959 to 1962.<br/>     New mechanics for Government and Resistance Leaders, US and Soviet Escalation, US Intel and Soviet Materiel, and Regional Alignment towards Castro&rsquo;s regime.<br/>     A miniature two-player game, Days of Pigs, that explores hypothetical variants of the failed Bay of Pigs invasion. <br/>     Sixteen new Event cards for the original Cuba Libre game, drawing on research published since the game was released and covering certain topics in more depth, such as women&rsquo;s role in the revolution, the urban wings of M-26-7 and other anti-government organisations, and the tools of repression used by Batista&rsquo;s government.<br/>     A new three-player variant scenario for Cuba Libre that approaches the revolution with a slightly different framing, and also allows for a shorter game with a reduced player-count.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Avengers, X-Men, Defenders, Guardians of the Galaxy, to name but a few. Each of these teams develops its own characteristics and strategies, though being part of a structured team also comes with limitations and drawbacks.<br/><br/><br/>     Avengers<br/>     New Avengers<br/>     X-Men<br/>     Uncanny X-Force<br/>     Defenders<br/>     A-Force<br/>     Guardians of the Galaxy<br/>     Deadpool Team-Up<br/>     Asgardians &amp; Allies<br/>     Spider-Army<br/>     Champions<br/>     Wakandans<br/>     United Heroes<br/>     Team Iron Man: Pro Registration<br/>     Team Captain America: Secret Avengers<br/><br/><br/>When adding a Team Deck to your game, all Heroes being used must be part of the same Team, and the Hard Challenge difficulty level should be used. That Team deck is shuffled and placed facedown within view of all players, with 2 cards revealed to form the Team Display. These are essentially Hero cards, with Action symbols at the bottom and a Special Effect. On their turn, a Hero can choose to either play a regular turn or they can choose to play a Team turn. In that case they don&rsquo;t touch their Hero cards (neither drawing nor playing) but choose instead one of the Team cards in the Display and play that card in the Storyline, as if it were their own card. Immediately a new card is drawn from the deck to fill the Team Display (until the deck runs out). This not only brings a different flavor to the match, but also gives Heroes more options of what to do on their turn. However, there is a downside to playing as a Team. Most Team decks have at least one card with a mandatory negative effect. This is in effect as long as that card is faceup on the Team Display. In order to shut it down, a Hero must take one for the team by taking a Team turn, choosing the negative card, and playing it facedown in the Storyline.<br/><br/>All Teams in this set can be played using solely Heroes which are part of boxes that are (or will be) available on retail. Although, of course, most of these Teams also have additional members who are part of exclusive expansions or Stretch Goals from this or previous campaigns. In the lists below, these latter characters are shown in italics. Also note that many of these Teams might still be bolstered by Heroes revealed over the course of the Multiverse campaign.<br/><br/>-description from Kickstarter campaign<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of the Little Bighorn, also called Custer&rsquo;s Last Stand, marked the most decisive Native American victory and the worst U.S. Army defeat in the long Plains Indian Wars. Fought on June 25, 1876, near the Little Bighorn River in Montana Territory, federal troops led by Lieutenant Colonel George Armstrong Custer were attacked by a band of Lakota Sioux and Cheyenne warriors. This game is primarily a solitaire game with the player controlling the US 7th Cavalry. <br/> If all Indian Leaders OR all 6 villager disks are eliminated, the game ends immediately and the 7th Cavalry are victorious. If either of these happen, the remaining Indians are assumed to surrender and agree to return to their reservation. Otherwise, the Indians have won.<br/><br/>A two-player variant is possible with the 2nd person controlling and rolling dice for the Indigenous American forces. Historically this battle was very lopsided, perhaps 600 Cavalry vs. 1,000s of braves. In the game the Cavalry will usually lose. When there are two players consider switching sides after the first game and compare results.<br/><br/>The game emphasizes theme and playability rather than strict historical recreation. Playing as the 7th Cavalry you won't know how many enemy units you will face.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We All Take from the River is an educational game of resource management and social deduction. You play as neighbors along a river, each with a unique set of objectives to complete over the course of several days. Sometimes you and your neighbor's objectives will overlap and sometimes they will clash.<br/><br/>Turns begin at the top of the river and proceed downstream. Players build and move structures along the river to control when they act, competing for the best spots available. Players at the top of the river will have the advantage of acting first, while players at the bottom of the river will have access to more resources that gather as the waters flow. If a player pollutes upstream, it may have negative consequences for their neighbors below.<br/><br/>Any combination of players may win by the end of the game so long as each of them have completed their objectives. Or, if the estuary becomes clogged with pollution and the river ecosystem is destroyed, every player will lose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players have over a dozen ways to draft cards in this set-collection style card game.<br/><br/>Players will play three rounds of three phases each drafting cards into their collection of cards. At the end of three phases scoring takes place. Three or more cards with the same color, shape, number, or even sequential run are eligible to score. You can even double up your points by creating sets that have two similarities such as a run with all the same color.<br/><br/>The player with most points at the end of round three is declared the winner, but watch out for those auction/bid points you make during the game because they subtract points from your final score at the very end. Draft is a game for 2-5 players that plays in 20-40 minutes and is fun enough for every member of the family, but has just the right amount of strategy to make even the most seasoned gamer appreciate the gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It offers some mechanics reminiscent of classic games such as Spades, Euchre, Pinochle and Hearts, but with incredibly nuanced gameplay.<br/><br/>How to play: <br/>13 cards are dealt to each player. Each player sets a bid for how many tricks they'll try to win; high card wins the trick! Collect too many tricks and over time you will become corrupted and your influence will suffer.  Collect too few tricks and you won't keep up with your adversaries! Strategize with your enemies to survive; you may have to make risky decisions in the process. But remember, allegiances change rapidly. Score the most influence points to win without being negatively affected by your corruption.<br/><br/>What separates A Battle of Onin from other traditional trick-taking games?<br/><br/>A reimagined 52 card deck along with familiar mechanics offers a new challenge for experienced trick-takers; while players who are unfamiliar with the genre will learn with ease.<br/><br/>With a cohesive blend of subtle complexity, cooperative elements, and unique strategies, A Battle of Onin requires the ability to play offensively and defensively simultaneously; as every hand can and must be strategized to your advantage...even the &quot;bad&quot; hands.<br/><br/>A Battle of Onin is designed to be color-blind friendly. For players who are colorblind, we have kanji symbols denoting color and faction; Featuring four unique characters that are easily distinguishable. Provided is a key to help translate the symbols and play seamlessly.<br/><br/>Because we know that skill levels vary, what makes this game stand apart from the rest is it's malleability. A Battle of Onin is Modular. We encourage you to play the multiple variants of gameplay we detail that fit your skill/enjoyment level. From basic, to advanced to expert mode. We also encourage you to implement your own ideas and house rules to maximize your fun-factor. Be creative and make the game as enjoyable as possible!<br/><br/>Beyond all that is the ease it takes to learn, set up, shuffle up and play. Though it takes minutes to learn, new players can play competitively almost immediately.  This gives A Battle of Onin re-playability. Most of the time, we don't just play one game. We play 2 or 3.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On the first Monday in October, the all-powerful Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court gather each year in their &quot;marble palace&quot; to decide the fate of a nation. Each player represents a long-standing institution or school of thought attempting to gain renown by shaping the composition of the high court, taking sides in landmark cases throughout the history of the United States, and determining the governing laws of the land. Players need to use their limited influence and actions wisely to manipulate the judicial philosophy of the Court and to prevail in as many cases as possible.<br/><br/>Over the course of two hours, First Monday in October &mdash; for which designer Jason Matthews worked as lead developer &mdash; re-creates the history of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1789 to the present day, through three distinct eras: Era I represents the founding of the Court in 1789 through the Civil War in 1865; Era II represents the time period from 1866 until the seminal decision of Brown v. Board in 1954; and Era III represents the modern era from 1955 until 2010.<br/><br/>The game revolves around the following four judicial philosophy tracks:<br/><br/>     Commerce Clause: This track represents the scope of Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution, which grants Congress the power to &quot;regulate commerce&quot; among the several states. <br/>     Equality &amp; Liberty: This track broadly represents the scope of individual equality and liberty, including but not limited to the 14th Amendment (i.e., equal protection, due process, and privacy rights). <br/>     Free Speech: This track represents the obligation in the 1st Amendment that Congress make no law abridging a person's freedom of speech, and the scope of permissible restrictions on that freedom. <br/>     Executive Power: This track broadly represents the scope of Article II of the U.S. Constitution, which enumerates the powers of the executive branch, including the Office of the President and law enforcement. <br/><br/><br/>Shifting each philosophy one way generally represents a more expansive Federalist interpretation of the above constitutional provisions that supports a stronger centralized federal government, whereas shifting each philosophy the other direction generally represents a more narrow Anti-Federalist application of these provisions that supports a more decentralized approach to government with less power concentrated at the federal level.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your wizards gaze across the mystical planet of Sygon. Volatile volcanoes have blazed away much of the world, except for a precious clearing of land. Here lies the various landscapes of Sygon: meadows, swamps, dunes, mountains, forests, and caves.<br/><br/>Each landscape hosts an unique spell component crucial to developing civilization on Sygon. Collect gold and the various spell components - flower, elixir, spice, powder, mushroom, and crystal - and maneuver your wizards to conjure towns, workshops, and markets to quickly advance your civilization. Use alchemy or forage to obtain components outside your grasp.<br/><br/>Sygon relies on you to bring prosperity to its ravaged lands. However, you are not alone. Wizards loyal to other civilizations plot to loot you and compete for control of the planet. Be wary of where you place your towns and wizards and build walls to protect them against thieving wizards and volcano eruptions. Rise from the ashes and bring glory to your civilization on Sygon.<br/><br/>For the game setup, the players will construct the randomly generated hexagonal game board of flower, elixir, spice, powder, mushroom, and crystal hexes and randomly assign a gold value to each hex. Players will begin the game by placing 2 towns in snake draft order. Each town is placed on an unsettled hex of choice with either 1 or 2 walls in the same hex. A player places their 3 wizards in hexes with their towns on their first turn.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they will move their wizards, conjure buildings, and cast spells in order. Each building type (town, workshop, market, and wall) contains an unique resource combination, and a player's wizard must be in a hex for them to build there. Action spells consist of wizards foraging component cards from the various landscapes of Sygon, stealing gold from nearby opponents, and protecting from stealing. Additional spell cards (charm, fissure, vanish, blizzard, power trip, &amp; foresight) may be added to this base 2-4 player game.<br/><br/>The goal of Hexes of Sygon is to accumulate enough and the most sorcery points (SP) of all players at the end of a round of turns to win, where SP are awarded through buildings.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It takes all the excitement of dice combat and combines it with pre-built deck construction that allows for multiple strategies for victory. Choose your Sigil, build your army, and prepare for War!<br/><br/>Each player start the game with a Sigil of Power related to their faction of choice, a 5 card starting hand, and a powerful Warlord who can advance your front lines by placing mana generators and pushing back the enemy. These mana generators allow units to spawn at them when summoned and also generate mana on every turn giving the player the power to cast multiple and increasingly powerful spells.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is simple... destroy your opponents Sigil which starts with a 20 point life counter. The first person whose Sigil's life counter reaches 0 loses. This is accomplished by using your Warlord, the action cards in your hand, and multiple units who can be summoned throughout the battle. Combat is strategy based with a touch of luck based on dice combat.<br/><br/>Gameplay is expandable up to 6 players and the base set out of the box can be played with up to 4 players. Multiple game variants and player count game options.<br/><br/>",

You can play to win, but you win by creating the best possible color relationship for each moment.

You're on a mission to explore all places beautiful and forgotten before your vacation is over.<br/><br/>Start the game by picking a Start Space and a Vehicle. Each Vehicle gives you different abilities, such as moving a little faster under certain conditions or immunity to negative events. Plan your route by choosing byways. Then travel across the country a little bit every day, planning around highway construction, moody weather, and your car's pesky tendency to break down!<br/><br/>The first player to travel all their Byways and circle back to their Start Space is the winner. Each player's route is determined by Byway Cards, which are drafted at the beginning of the game. After routes are chosen, players receive a hand of five Event Cards, one of which is drawn by the clockwise player right before the player can move. Whatever is written on that Event Card - good or bad - happens to the player who is about to move. Players can then travel up to six spaces per turn, trading in each unmoved space for the ability to discard an unwanted Event Card and draw a replacement.<br/><br/>Each time the game comes back around to player 1, a new Construction Card is flipped. Construction Cards block off some of the fastest roads in the game. After five Construction Cards are drawn, players pass their Event Cards. <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a sequel to The Fields of Normandy 2. It is a stand-alone game, not an expansion. It is a solitaire wargame.<br/><br/>Due to a range of factors, many troops from the 82nd and 101st Airborne Divisions were scattered and struggled to come under the control of division headquarters. Many of these troops formed into small groups, organised by officers and NCOs and fought behind enemy lines for up to five days. Although mainly fighting for their own lives, these groups also helped to clear significant parts of the more organised German resistance.<br/><br/>This game is a fairly quick playing, highly replayable and fun experience, whilst maintaining the need for tactical thinking and decision making.<br/><br/>If you have played The Fields of Normandy 2, then you will already be familiar with many of the rules for The Fields of Normandy XL. However, there are some material differences to look out for:<br/>Maps consist of almost twice as many hexes &ndash; 48 hexes compared to 28.<br/>There are now 15 potential enemy positions for each mission compared to 12 and these are, to some extent, positioned randomly each time rather than being fixed.<br/>Missions run to a maximum of 14 turns compared to 10.<br/>Maps include a new Terrain feature &ndash; Walls (instead of fences, which had no gameplay effect). Walls do have gameplay effects.<br/>Your US force now includes two new Units &ndash; a Lieutenant Unit and a Sniper Unit which both have their own Order charts.<br/>The Lieutenant now calls in Artillery strikes and therefore US Rifle Squads no longer do.<br/>US Rifle Squads can now clear Mines (or more thematically perhaps, establish a clear route through them).<br/>There is now a stacking limit of three US Units per hex.<br/>A German Tiger (tank) might appear!<br/>German Snipers are now a separate unit and operate independently to Rifle Squads.<br/>German Artillery usually has more than one possible location hex per map.<br/><br/>In the game, you will be controlling small groups of soldiers consisting of three Rifle Squads, a Machine Gun Team, a Bazooka Team, a Mortar Team, a Sniper Team and a Lieutenant, moving them around the hex maps and undertaking other orders to achieve the objective.<br/><br/>The Fields of Normandy XL is an accessible, portable, solitaire &quot;hex and counter&quot; style war game in a book.<br/><br/>12 Full colour mission maps, rules and a counter sheet are included (to be mounted on card). You will need to provide 2 six-sided dice.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each chooses an iconic champion to play as and work together to confront and defeat a central supervillain. Each hero has their own unique starter deck of Origin cards that highlight that character's unique strengths and skills. Each Hero also comes with a Deck of super-powerful Solo Cards that only they have access to, featuring their most powerful abilities.<br/><br/>On their turn, players will explore to add new map panels to the board. Each Map Panel contains new Union Cards to add to their deck. There are also City cards with Challenges to overcome and Enemies to defeat, collecting outrageous rewards. Beyond that, Map Panels have Actions and special set-ups so you never know what's going to be around the corner! Players control how the board is built and a one-of-a-kind Map is constructed each game.<br/><br/>All the while, the Peril of the Supervillain grows, their plot escalates, and they unleash minions, maniacal machinations, and bring their own formidable combat prowess to bear. Each Supervillain has their own means of conquering the city, each time you build the board it is different, and each Hero has their own powers that they can add to and hone as part of your own Union City Alliance!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

This is not even the real world, as you&rsquo;ve known it until now, at least...This is more&quot;.<br/><br/>For fifteen years players had to customize their own deck: now, at last, they can customize their cards too!<br/><br/>Prodigy Game Cards is a card game, you don't collect it, proper for experienced players; every player drives a group of people &quot;special&quot; in it: these people are called WIPper, in specific places around the world, that in order to prevail on the adversaries fight for many purposes.<br/><br/>These characters, at first sight, seem just common people, but possess increased ability that we called &quot;prodigies.&quot; It is a WIPper who succeeds in these &quot;prodigies&quot;. Who is not able to do it, is without bond. Four types of bond exist and each is represented, in the game, by a different color:<br/><br/>Molecular - yellow: those people that can modify their phisical structure and their molecular density in different ways.<br/>Elementary - green: they possess the ability to channel, to send forth and to check different types of energy using the body as catalyst.<br/>Feral - red: they possess a combination of Dna human and animal, that allow them to possess animal physical powers.<br/>Psionic - blue: they are the WIPpers that possess some superior mental abilities.<br/><br/>To play a game of Prodigy Game Cards it needs at least two players. Every player must possess WIPper (the protagonists of our history), Places (where they fight) and a deck of Prodigies (the special actions that are able to do).<br/><br/>With Prodigy Game Cards you can directly reach a new level of personalization: the Prodigies have  the technology Scracth&amp;Play, developed in collaboration with Cartamundi, that allows the players to personalize, in phase of construction of the deck, every single paper.<br/><br/>Every Prodigy possesses three levels of power: low, middle and high. <br/>According to the strategy and experience, and according to the objective that the player want to get during the game, he decides what value &quot;to release.&quot; To increase a low value, is necessary to remove the patina that covers the left yellow panel of the paper; to increase the value, without going to far, it is recommended the panel (orange) found to the center; if you need  values of maximum power, it needs to set the right the panel (red) free.<br/><br/>",

Maelstrom's Edge uses about 20 to 30 models a side, making it easy to model, easy to paint and easy to play. Forces consist of several small-sized units, which is why we call the game a 'squad-based skirmish game'. Because it is a miniatures game, you get to assemble and paint your own models to pit against an opponent on a table dressed up with terrain to form your battlefield.<br/><br/>The conflicts on your table take the form of missions set in the desperate Maelstrom's Edge universe, populated by the Epirian Foundation and their robotic forces, the secretive Karist Enclave supported by the alien Angels, and various other factions. The content below highlights our game, background and models, and how you can get started.<br/><br/>",

That Team deck is shuffled and placed facedown within view of all players, with 2 cards revealed to form the Team Display. These are essentially Hero cards, with Action symbols at the bottom and a Special Effect. On their turn, a Hero can choose to either play a regular turn or they can choose to play a Team turn. In that case they don&rsquo;t touch their Hero cards (neither drawing nor playing) but choose instead one of the Team cards in the Display and play that card in the Storyline, as if it were their own card. Immediately a new card is drawn from the deck to fill the Team Display (until the deck runs out). This not only brings a different flavor to the match, but also gives Hero more options of what to do on their turn. However, there is a downside to playing as a Team. Most Team decks have at least one card with a mandatory negative effect. This is in effect as long as that card is faceup on the Team Display. In order to shut it down, a Hero must take one for the team by taking a Team turn, choosing the negative card, and playing it facedown in the Storyline. There&rsquo;s no &ldquo;I&rdquo; in Team!<br/><br/>All Teams in this set require the use of Heroes who are part of exclusive expansions or Stretch Goals from previous campaigns, which is why we&rsquo;re offering them as an exclusive Optional Buy, so backers can decide whether they want it or not. In the lists below, these exclusive characters are shown in italics. Although, of course, most of these Teams also have additional members which are part of boxes that are (or will be) available on retail. Also note that many of those Teams might still be bolstered by Heroes revealed over the course of the Multiverse campaign.<br/><br/>-description from Kickstarter campaign<br/><br/>",

Its origin and motivations are a mystery, but driven by an inexhaustible energy, this colossus of metal sows chaos in its wake, leaving behind ruins and hearts filled with fear. Faced with this unprecedented challenge, three brave heroes of diverse skills and origins unite with a common goal: to stop the unstoppable machine of destruction. Together, they must face unimaginable dangers, test their wits, and risk everything to protect humanity and restore hope. The fate of all now depends on the courage and determination of these three heroes.<br/><br/>Game Development:<br/>The game consists of resolving: 1) the Giant cards, 2) the Heroes' rondels, and 3) the City cards. These mechanics are explained in detail later, but it is most important to understand this sequence.<br/>If the Giant cards run out, it is considered that the Giant has reached the City. From then on, the sequence is: 1) The City receives 2 points of damage, 2) The rondels are resolved, and 3) The City mechanics are resolved. This continues until the Giant is defeated or destroys the City.<br/><br/><br/>Introducci&oacute;n:<br/>En un mundo donde el vapor y los engranajes dominan, la tranquilidad de las urbes se ve amenazada por la llegada de un Gigante Mec&aacute;nico.

Ante este desaf&iacute;o sin precedentes, tres valientes h&eacute;roes de diversas habilidades y or&iacute;genes se unen con un objetivo com&uacute;n: detener la imparable m&aacute;quina de destrucci&oacute;n. Unidos, deben enfrentar peligros inimaginables, poner a prueba su ingenio y arriesgarlo todo para proteger a la humanidad y restaurar la esperanza. El destino de todos depende ahora de la valent&iacute;a y determinaci&oacute;n de estos tres h&eacute;roes.<br/><br/>Desarrollo del Juego:<br/>El juego consiste en ir resolviendo: 1) las cartas de Gigante, 2) los rondeles de H&eacute;roes y 3) las cartas de Ciudad. M&aacute;s adelante se explica en detalle estas mec&aacute;nicas pero lo m&aacute;s importante es entender esta secuencia.<br/>Si se acaban las cartas de Gigante, se considera que este lleg&oacute; a la Ciudad. A partir de entonces la secuencia es: 1) La Ciudad recibe 2 puntos de da&ntilde;o, 2) Se resuelven los rondeles y 3) Se resuelven las mec&aacute;nicas de la Ciudad. Esto contin&uacute;a hasta que el Gigante sea derrotado o destruya la Ciudad.<br/><br/>",

Or will the bandit get the better of you? Sometimes it is better to disengage than push a losing fight.<br/><br/>Violent Skies is a solitaire game of aerial combat in the Second World War. Using a game card that acts as your Cockpit and also as a mission generator. The player and Bandit take alternating actions to try and get a shot on the opposition's aircraft.<br/><br/>This first season of games puts you in the cockpit of the main fighters during the tumultuous months after the invasion of France. Starting with the aerial operations over Dynamo (the Dunkirk Evacuation) to the Battle of Britain and the last daylight bombing raid as the Blitz starts, you will be flying sorties, shooting down bandits and trying your best to survive.<br/>Each sortie lasts between 5-10 minutes, and the player has a logbook to advance their career. As the player completes a campaign, they have the option to keep the logbook and continue their career in different aircraft and theatres.<br/><br/>All is needed is at least four D6, a small marker for the advantage track, and a pen or pencil for the logbook. Everything else is included in the minimal construction print and play PDF.  Three optional counters are included and need to be folded and cut out but the rest is ready straight off the printer.<br/><br/>Included as flyable aircraft are the Spitfire MkI/II, Hurricane Mk1, Bf109E3/4, Bf-110C.<br/><br/>Each aircraft comes with two sortie cards (your cockpit and mission generator), campaign tables, optional damage table, Skills sheet and counters.<br/><br/>There are Logbooks for the Lufrwaffe and RAF in low ink and full colour, as well as a detailed example of play.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>.....and remember, watch out for the &quot;Hun in the Sun&quot; and never underestimate a &quot;fat old puffer&quot;<br/><br/>",

We live in an unprecedented era of progress, and new steam-powered inventions are developed faster than ever. Cities are growing, trade is flourishing, and we are developing our most ambitious machine ever: a giant contraption that will bring even more progress to the city. Yes, some trees are being cut down, and the river doesn't flow as plentifully as before, but there's still an abundance of trees and water, and we can use the extra space to expand our city &mdash; and it's not like the old creatures on those forests can do anything about it.<br/><br/>On your turn in Daitoshi, you either produce or move your magnate to a new district in which you will be able to send your workers to work, command the exploit of forest or river hexes to fuel your endless need for steam, and perform an action to expand and show your greatness to the city.<br/><br/>These actions not only help you in your search for acknowledgement, but help all the inhabitants of the big city. You will expand the city and electrify its districts, discover and develop new steam-powered inventions, and trade with faraway cities. You may even help the city build its gargantuan project: the mega-machine. Some forests might be cut down, and some rivers may be dried up, but in your generosity, you will help the displaced workers from those areas by giving them new jobs at your service.<br/><br/>Old legends suggest the forests and rivers are guarded by Yōkai, but progress can't be stopped because of some old fairy tales. Just in case, though, it could be wise to participate on some reforestation projects and hide your participation in the abuse of the natural resources...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

By doing this, truckers create unique strategies to achieve different goals during the mission, which reward them with prestige among their peers and employers.<br/><br/>Players must be quick because the Corporation is hunting down the smugglers to recover its resources. Players must also keep an eye out for the other Truckers, who will try everything they can to collect additional cargo and get to the destination first, even if that means shooting down another truck.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>AWARDS &amp; HONORS<br/><br/>2018 - Luso Design Awards (Portugal) - Product Design - Bronze<br/>2018 - Luso Design Awards (Portugal) - Product Art - Bronze<br/>2018 - Catarse Board Game Prototype Contest (Brazil) - Top 5<br/>2018 - The Game Crafter&acute;s Board Game Rules Sanity Test - 66/80.<br/>2020 - The Game Crafter&acute;s Board Game Rules Sanity Test - 77/80. <br/>       &quot;Trucker combat race game has easy to follow rules and looks like it can carry a heavy load of fun.&quot; (Gamecrafter, June 2020)<br/><br/>",

The main German offensive, dubbed the Sichelschnitt (razor cut), struck through the lightly defended Ardennes Forest and emerged at Sedan. Alarmed at the prospect of a German breakout here, and the collapsing defense at Sedan, the French ordered an immediate counter-attack. General Heinz Guderian, however, had already ordered the bulk of the German panzer formations to breakout from the Sedan bridgehead, and ordered the Gross Deutchland Regiment, with a supporting Kampfgruppe formed from the 8th Panzer Division to take and hold the high ground at Stonne, to guard the German's bridgehead over the Meuse River and expanding flank. For the first, and only, time during the 1940 campaign, Guderian's Panzers ran into the premier French tank, the Char B1-Bis, as the French counter attacked to reduce the Sedan bridgehead.  Over three days, the town of Stonne changed hands 17 times as German and French armored forces dueled for the strategic high-ground overlooking Sedan.<br/><br/>This is the fifth game in the Blitzkrieg in the West Series, covering the battle at an operational scale. The game is designed for 2 players, taking on the roles of the French and German commanders, but is suitable for solitaire play as well.<br/><br/>The High Flying Dice Games edition features all new graphics by Bruce Yearian.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1.5 hours<br/>Hex: 1/2 miles / 0.8 kilometer<br/>Units: Company<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 11x17&quot; full color map <br/>One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (180 1/2&quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)<br/>One 6-page rulebook<br/>Two Player Aid Charts (TEC/CRT)<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours<br/><br/>",

This cuts both ways: the abilities of the cards you select, your posture, your banter, and the content of your character all give your opponent insight into what your move may be - if you let it.<br/><br/>Gameplay is similar to Rock, Paper, or Scissors however, you declare what attack you intend to use prior to revealing it. If you lied, well, that's fine, but if you told the truth you gain Honor Points which will enable you to deal more damage later on!

It can be described simply as a cross between Scrabble&trade; and Dominoes.<br/><br/>The game contains 124 cards with 496 English words. Each card has four family-friendly words (one per edge) and a point value between 1 and 5.<br/><br/>There are 17 ways to play the game.<br/><br/>In the basic Classic Mode, players compete to get the highest score by connecting related words. For example, TEACHER can be connected with STUDENT, SCHOOL, RESPECT, LEARNING, JOB as well as a dozen other words.<br/><br/>Hilarious dialog begins when someone attempts a dubious connection and has to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; it to the group. This makes it a game about connecting people.<br/><br/>This family and party game is for use at home and school as well as corporate office team building.<br/><br/>The compact box is suitable for travel, camp and cottage.<br/><br/>",

A Rhino deck consists of 55 premium playing cards: a special set of 52 playing cards numbered 0-12 in four color suits, along with two &quot;Big Five&quot; Bonus cards, and one Super Safari card. Each player begins the game with their own set of five special character tokens representing the &quot;Big Five&quot; African mammals - rhinoceros, elephant, lion, leopard, and Cape buffalo. Each token has unique properties to influence game scoring and may only be used once during the course of the game.<br/>    <br/>The object of the game is to bid correctly on the exact number of tricks that a player will take (win) in each subsequent round of play. Points are awarded for a correct bid and are either zero or negative for an incorrect bid. The player with most points after all rounds have been played is declared the winner. The game is played in 13 rounds with the number of cards dealt per round varying from seven to one and back to seven. Player strategy combining with statistical probability (chance) interacts the effects of dealt cards, Bonus Cards, and the character tokens. Multiple skill levels of play and a partner option with 4 or 6 players is available. Designed for ages 14 and up. However, younger precocious children may also pick up this game rapidly especially when guided by an experienced player.<br/><br/>",

Players will pre-plan their turns ahead of time, studying their competitors and finding the right combination of abilities to grant them victory. Will your oathen hero unleash a flurry of blows against your target? Or will the other players play defensively to negate your attacks?<br/><br/>Combat carries out one ability at a time, each player playing their next chosen action. The strongest of abilities will then go on cooldown, and will be unavailable for use until a certain number of turns has passed. Plan correctly, and you could pull off amazing combos - fail, and you may be exposed to such attacks yourself.<br/><br/>The arena is constructed with 36 of 52 total locations, providing boosts and traps that can alter your battle, and making every game into a unique match. Oathen also comes with different game modes, including arena, capture the flag, and round table.<br/><br/>Choose between six Oathen champions to play as.

        "description": "EGYPT, 1942... After defeat at the Battle of Gazala, the British 8th Army has been chased back through the western deserts, fighting a rearguard action to hold the line near a railway halt called El Alamein.  Here, the tide of the desert war would turn decisively in the British&rsquo;s favour. At El Alamein Rommel&rsquo;s weary army was repeatedly defeated and forced into a very long retreat to save itself. Meanwhile, American and British troops land on the shores of Morocco and Algeria in Operation Torch, with the plan to cut-off the Germans by capturing Tunisia. A hard seven-month campaign would follow in the final struggle to capture North Africa.<br/><br/>&bull; BACKGROUND A general overview of the later North Africa campaign, from Gazala, through three battles at El Alamein to Operation Torch and the Allies&rsquo; attack into Tunisia. With British, American and French forces of 1st Army in the north and 8th Army pursuing Rommel&rsquo;s Panzer Armee Afrika to the Mareth Line, and then beyond, in the south. This book covers the desert fighting from May 1942 to May 1943 and the Axis&rsquo; ultimate surrender in Tunisia.<br/><br/>&bull; ARMY LISTS Nine army lists designed to be played with the character of the principal combatants for North Africa: the veteran Deutsche Afrikakorps for 1942 and Defenders of Tunisia for 1943, Italian armoured and infantry divisions to face British (and Commonwealth) armoured and infantry divisions. Also, for Tunisia, the first combat operations for the US 1st Armoured Division and US infantry divisions, as well as ex-Vichy French &lsquo;March&rsquo; divisions, now turned against their former Axis allies.<br/><br/>&bull; SPECIAL RULES New special rules to adapt the core Battlegroup rules to the later North African battlefields. Recreating the character of desert fighting, with its dusty conditions, reliance on tank warfare and mobile formations, and the wearing effects of the harsh conditions. Also rules for the colder, muddy, difficult hill-country of northern Tunisia, a very different type of battlefield, all helping to create games with the distinctive feel for the end of the &lsquo;desert&rsquo; war.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Football is not only a game of X&rsquo;s and O&rsquo;s strategy, but also a game of mud and rain, of wind and frigid cold, of players adapting to the environment and mastering the elements to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Extreme cold has shaped the mythology of Pro Football, from the &ldquo;Ice Bowl&rdquo; in Green Bay to the &ldquo;Freezer Bowl&rdquo; in Cincinnati and &ldquo;Red Right 88&rdquo; in Cleveland. Snow, sleet, ice, and extreme cold change the conditions of the game and, as such, force coaches to adjust their strategies.<br/><br/>Rain imbues football with an epic scope. Weather is the great equalizer, where elite athletes are hobbled by wet hands, soft earth, and standing water. Add in wind and you&rsquo;ve got &quot;football weather.&quot;<br/><br/>With this new Breakaway Football: Weather Expansion, you can now experience these same epic coaching conditions at your own table.<br/><br/>The expansion set includes three custom play mats themed for Rain, Snow, and Wind. To achieve the effect of playing in weather, the expansion features two new Game Day decks - one themed for &quot;Rain Day&quot; and another cold weather &quot;Snow Day&quot; -as well as forecast cards with specific modifiers for each weather condition.<br/><br/>Wind is handled through new cards on the board that apply modifiers, making the kicking game more challenging. Strong enough wind can even affect the passing game.<br/><br/>The rule book for the Weather Expansion not only outlines these new mechanisms but also includes two templates for the new weather decks, which allows one card pull to determine the specific game conditions (forecast, wind speed/direction, temperature).<br/><br/>Experience epic drama in the elements with the Breakaway Football: Weather Expansion!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of the game you will get a random objective, to achieve it,you will be able to equip your self with weapons, armors and other interesting tools that will help you reach your goal.   Your character is also able to evolve into whatever you chose from a set of new abilities and improvements to your actual skills, for example, you can make grow another limb to your body or wings to fly.   Once you get your goal, a portal will open for you to escape and win the game.<br/><br/>You can also chose to play as the GODS and the goal will be to eliminate the Heroes and stop them to escape through a portal.   As the Gods, you do not need trivial items to be better, instead, as the rounds pass by, you will be able to summon random Gods that will arrive with a random Aberration, powerful minions under your control that if are compatible with your God, special skills will be unlocked (for the God and the Aberration) creating new and more interesting strategies to fight against the Heroes.   You win the game if you kill heroes or if you are able to evolve up to the maximum power (11 rounds) before any Hero can escape through a portal.   If nobody chooses to play as the Gods, the cards of the Gods have their own A.I. with a set of simple instructions that players will have to execute during each Gods turn to give them autonomy.<br/><br/>All these happens in a unique and innovative 3D tile system which round by round will be dynamically changing by rotating tiles, adding or removing barriers that blocks the access to adjacent tiles, increase terrain highness and, change of weather!<br/><br/>A fantastic feature from FGF's Dynamic 3D Tile System is that you can use it for other existing combat board games and RPGs and add them its unique features and benefits (rotation, dynamic, block access, space elevations, art customization), that way you will refresh and boost their game experience!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Slam Wars is a card battle game that celebrates the various wrestling territories that existed from the 1940's until the 1990's. It captures the unique flavor of the territory by using historical wrestlers, tag teams, managers, promoters, announcers and referees. Each Slam Wars set is a standalone game, but can be seamlessly integrated with any other Slam Wars set to form a larger playing pool.<br/><br/>Slam Wars: Wrestling Legends of the Superstation comes in a 2-piece full-color dual deck poker box and includes a 20-page full-color instruction guide. There are a total of 90 playing cards:<br/><br/>     44 solo wrestlers<br/>     16 tag teams<br/>     13 stat boosters<br/>     10 common match stipulations <br/>     6 special grudge match stipulations<br/>     1 championship <br/><br/><br/>A round of play is called an &quot;event&quot; and consists of 7 matches (4 solo and 3 tag team). Seven match stipulation cards will be exposed, one for each match of the event. Each wrestler and tag team card is rated in 5 different categories (represented by symbols that match the stipulation cards). The objective is to strategically place the cards you were dealt in matches where they can perform the best (i.e. have high ratings). Like a good wrestling booker, you are trying to maximize your wrestler's strengths and minimize their weaknesses. After comparing the stats in that particular category, the card with the higher rating wins the match-up.  Whichever player wins a majority of the 7 matches wins the event and is awarded the championship card. The holder of the championship card has an advantage heading into the next round of play. Much like poker, the rounds can continue until the participants decide to end it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This time, the Germans prioritised their efforts in the south, towards the oil fields of the Caucasus region in Fall Blau (Case Blue). German and Axis armies will advance east, into the Caucusus&rsquo;, along the Don river and across it to the Volga. Their sweeping summer advances will bring them to the city of Stalingrad. The infamous Battle of Stalingrad will become a turning point in WWII, a savage house-to-house battle through the ruins of the city to halt the Germans and draw-in ever more forces, until a Russian counter-offensive can be launched to encircle the entire German 6th Army.<br/><br/><br/>     HISTORICAL BACKGROUND<br/><br/><br/>A complete overview of war in southern Russia in 1942, starting with preliminary operations in the spring, the the start of Fall Blau, the Battle of Voronezh, Operations on the Don, Operation Edelweiss&rsquo; drive into the Caucasus region, the Battle of the Don Bend and the panzers&rsquo; drive to the Volga and Stalingrad.

Always does it march forward, bringing change and challenges, wars and disasters, invaders and internal rebellion.<br/><br/>This supplement for Oathmark: Battles of the Lost Age, focuses on the passage of time and its effect on a players kingdom. While wars and battle still determine their ultimate fate, many other events can affect the armies of a kingdom. Plagues and blights can reduce access to soldiers from specific territories. Attempted coups can cost a king some of his best generals. On the other hand, unexpected alliances might give a kingdom access to unusual troops, or the birth of a new heir might bring wondrous presents.<br/><br/>Along with the rules for the passing of years, this book also presents the option to train your units to fight in special formations, such as phalanxes, shield walls, and skirmish lines.

All of them, that is, except one! <br/><br/>When your grandfather, Howard Carter, discovered the remains of the ancient pharaoh Tutankhamen, he believed there was another tomb connected to the first. A hidden tomb. A Lost Mummy. Now, many hard years and one fateful slip later, you find yourself trapped in that very tomb! Will you escape, or will you become just another lost memory buried under the sand?<br/><br/>The Lost Mummy is a printable escape room game that transforms any space into a kids escape room experience. The game is designed to challenge 10 &ndash; 13 year-old children. It combines the teamwork, tension, and puzzle-solving of escape rooms with the laid-back ease of group party games.<br/><br/>Players will work together to escape from an ancient Egyptian tomb before time runs out. Gameplay is centered on a series of sequential puzzle sheets hidden around the room. Each puzzle solved progresses the story, and puts you one step closer to escaping the Lost Mummy&rsquo;s tomb. Game setup is quick and spoiler-free, and hints are handled by an online hint system that players access on their smartphones. This means that no game master is required to supervise the experience, so you can join the game alongside your players.<br/><br/>The game can expand to accommodate any number of players by dividing your group into teams of 2-4, and then having them race against each other to see who escapes first. In addition, you can edit the game file before printing to customize your own escape room experience.<br/><br/>Will you solve the mystery of the mummy&rsquo;s tomb, before you&rsquo;re trapped here forever?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Luke Skywalker fought on many fronts of the Galactic Civil War, battling the Empire both from the cockpit of his T-65 X-wing and on the ground with his lightsaber and trusty DL-44 blaster. Wherever the war effort took him, Skywalker was a symbol of hope to his fellow Rebels and soon Star Wars&trade;: Legion players will get the chance to experience him like never before.<br/><br/>Fantasy Flight Games is happy to announce the Limited Edition Luke Skywalker Commander Expansion, available soon at your local retailer!<br/><br/>Ready for Action<br/>Whether leading the fabled Rogue Squadron or a small strike team, Luke Skywalker earned his reputation as one of the Rebellion&rsquo;s most enduring heroes through countless battles and this Limited Edition expansion depicts him as he appeared during one of the most iconic clashes in the Star Wars saga: the Battle of Hoth. Wearing his Rebel flight suit and perched atop the wreckage of his T-47 airspeeder, this version of Luke Skywalker is ready to continue the fight on the ground.<br/><br/>Not only does the miniature included here bring a totally new sculpt of Luke Skywalker to your Star Wars: Legion battles, you have the freedom to customize it to fit your personal taste.

This expansion also contains a unit card with abilities identical to the Hero of the Rebellion version of Luke Skywalker found in the Star Wars: Legion Core Set, but now featuring updated artwork matching his new appearance. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll also find copies of Luke Skywalker&rsquo;s command cards My Ally is the Force, Return of the Jedi, and Son of Skywalker featuring this updated artwork alongside the unit card. Finally, to ensure Luke Skywalker is fully prepared for battle, this expansion also contains reprints of four upgrade cards: Emergency Stims, Environmental Gear, Force Push, and Hope.<br/><br/>The Limited Edition Luke Skywalker Commander Expansion will only be available for a limited time.

Bloodfist Champions allows for multiple ways to play.<br/><br/>The original game, Bloodfist Champions, allows players to choose their fighting forces from 45 different teams, each with its own completely unique characters and style of play. Players battle through a league style setting, with each match awarding them experience points and gold for their team.<br/><br/>Bloodfist Champions: Battle Royale pits up to 30 players, each controlling one character, in a massive winner-take-all bout. It includes the same experience points and gold gains as the original, but focus is narrowed to what helps one player in the arena, rather than worrying about a whole team.<br/><br/>Bloodfist Champions: RPG is a tabletop roleplaying game in the world of Bloodfist, allowing players to experience the rich world as a group of traveling Bloodfist players, either as a team or as individual Battle Royale players (or both).<br/><br/>All of this mayhem runs on a system of dice involving uniquely illustrated six-sided attack dice. You roll to attack your enemy, and, if successful, roll again to see if you hurt him. Any time you hit an opponent hard enough to hurt him in any way, you earn, 1, 2, 3, or 5 experience points for the player who performed it, and the same amount of points are scored toward victory for your team (or individual in Battle Royale).<br/><br/>",

All players will participate in the game as the new management of Airline 81 Airlines, and must strive to normalize airline performance. Management expects that the new aircraft A81 introduced to normalize its performance will play a role as a game changer.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to operate the A81 aircraft in an efficient manner, producing high performance.<br/><br/>The game board and auxiliary game board are placed in the center, and the player takes a personal board with the same color as his cube according to the number of players. The game starts with a first player and runs several rounds clockwise.<br/><br/>In player turn, each player proceeds in the order of the next three steps.<br/>1. [Rolling the dice]<br/>The player rolls three dice at the same time in his turn and distinguishes the top color of each dice. Designate A for the same color on the top of each die and B and C for the different colors. <br/>(Example: Yellow+yellow+red = A+A+B / Blue+Purple+Red = A+B+C / Blue+Blue+Blue= A+A+A)<br/>2. [Choose 1 out of 2 tasks]<br/>The player chooses one of the two tasks(flight Service, staff training) in his turn and behavior once.<br/> - Task 1: Flight Service<br/> - Task 2: Staff Training<br/>3. [Moving score markers based on behavior]<br/>Move the score marker according to the player's behavior immediately.<br/><br/>The next player will also continue in the same way in the three-step order, and the round will end when all players play once. As several rounds progress, if the cube is no longer available after one's turn(if there is no A81 reservation), the game ends after only the corresponding round.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the A81 aircraft management performance(passenger fare score, employee training score, reservation waiting score, checked baggage import performance, profitability improvement performance, marketing performance) is all calculated and the player with the highest total wins.<br/>If the total is tied, the player with more colored cubes in the business class wins. If it is still a tie, more players will win the cube(reserved waiting) remaining on the individual board, and if it is still a tie, they will win jointly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Race For The Title is a deckbuilding football card game for 1-4 players. Every player starts with a weak hand of cards which they attempt to improve upon every round as they accumulate money and play matches against their opponents.<br/><br/>You will look to strengthen your team so to be more successful in matches, but you'll also need to grow your club's finances so you can buy new players. It's a tricky balancing act to achieve and it might be the case that smart decisions only start paying off as the game goes into the late stages.<br/><br/>There are five kinds of cards in the game:<br/><br/>- player cards feature players and you'll use them in matches against an opponent <br/>- formation cards give your playing skills a permanent boost. Keep them on display at all times<br/>- stadium cards increase the money you make when you play a home match<br/>- action cards allow you to weaken an opponent's team or, in some cases, gain extra cards for free<br/>- economy cards give you income you can spend in the Marketplace<br/><br/>You'll only ever have five cards (six/seven if you happen to have a formation/stadium card in play) in play at one time. Your active hand is known as your Line-Up.<br/><br/>To play matches, pick an opponent. Add up your total attacking scores across your Line-Up. Your opponent does the same but adds up their total defence score. Then both managers add a dice roll to your score. Highest combined score wins the match!<br/><br/>The winning team takes three points and moves up the league table. The first team to reach 70 points wins the title!<br/><br/>Race For The Title is the second game by Webstar Games - the first, Counter Attack, is also football themed.<br/><br/>Note: Race For the Title didn't meet its Kickstarter goal in 2022. It has since been redesigned (which is why you'll find two different looks to the game) and is ready for a Kickstarter relaunch soon<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

You and your crew will be assigned with taking part in nightly &lsquo;terror&rsquo; area bombing raids against various English cities during 1940 and 1941 in an attempt to break the will of the British people. Guided by sophisticated radio beam navigation equipment, your bombardier will be able to locate the target city in pitch darkness, even in poor or bad weather. But it certainly won't be a cake walk, as RAF night fighters will continuously be hunting your bomber stream, not to mention searchlights and deadly FLAK you will encounter over the target cities.<br/><br/>With most of the rules integrated into the tables, there is practically no learning curve or rules memorization. And with detailed damage modeling, fuel management, numerous crewmen skills, mission weather effects, random events, and a multitude of table modifiers, The Blitz: 1940-1941 offers memorable experiences and high replay value.

        "description": "The year is 1954. The Algerian people are rising up against French colonizers who have oppressed them for over a century. But this is no regular war - victory will not be achieved on the battlefield, but by winning the hearts and minds of everyday Algerians.<br/><br/>Insurgent: Algeria is a simple, asymmetric card game for 1 to 2 players which recreates the Algerian War for independence on your tabletop. Players take the role of the French government and the Algerian resistance [the FLN], which have separate faction decks with unique abilities.<br/><br/>The game can be won in two ways - attrition and domination. An attrition victory involves collecting the most public support, represented by the icons on the top of the cards, in two of three fronts - military, political and diplomatic. A domination victory occurs when a player overwhelms their opponent in any one front. Players must balance these competing objectives strategically in order to win the game.<br/><br/>The solo game pits the Algerian player against a French AI, which is simple to implement but provides a difficult challenge since the AI plays cards faster than the two-player game allows.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each iconic supervillain also has their own card, making each mission even more dynamic.<br/><br/>Jason Keeping, the author, drew on several hundred matches as well as feedback from the community to hone his game mode before polishing and simplifying it in collaboration with our teams. The solo-mode rulebook will be written by Paul&rsquo;s Grogan&rsquo;s team to match the quality of our new rulebook. This mode can be used with all the Adventure Mode scenarios from seasons 1, 2, and 3, even for the official scenario from our The Overlord magazine! As a result, more than 60 scenarios will now be playable in either solo or cooperative mode.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carolyn, having survived the horrifying night at Creech Manor all those years ago, is now a teenager. She swore to get revenge on the entity of the manor that took everything (except her life and Mr. Floppy) from her.  She has been growing and honing her psychic powers, studying and practicing each and every day for this moment.  She pauses outside looking up at the old Manor to experience her feelings. Her eyes begin to glow slightly as she only finds one emotion present... it isn't fear or trepidation... no... it is the need for REVENGE. Carolyn closes her eyes and focuses here psychic energy. When she opens them, she stands in the foyer. &quot;Where are you Helen? You sardonic bitch!&quot;<br/><br/>It is time to bring the fight to the Poltergeist (or can be used with any other Killer of your choosing!). Carolyn's revenge features a new Final Girl, with all-new special Action cards that will let her use her psychic abilities to make psychic attacks, teleport, and even psychically attune weapons and items so that they can be used to deal psychic damage to the Killer. Once you have amassed enough psychic damage on the killer, you can attempt to banish them to limbo forever by succeeding with the Psychic Expulsion Action card!<br/><br/>This Sequel character pack (standard SG) comes with several cards (final amount to be determined) of the Action Card, Item Card, and Final Girl card variety plus a Secret Envelope for Carolyn. Plus for those going for the miniatures, you will get a teenage Carolyn Miniature (premium SG)!<br/><br/>This pack can be used against ANY killer, at ANY location. It essentially creates an alternate win condition for you.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your village has been overrun by savage werewolves, which are represented by the number on each of the cards that make up your village. To get rid of these fanged fiends faster than the neighboring villages, use your residents' special abilities and your powerful secret weapon: a silver eye.<br/><br/>Call for a vote when you think you have the fewest werewolves, but be careful as everyone else gets one more turn to save their own village first...<br/><br/>Silver Eye is a fast and engaging traditional card game with a werewolf twist! Everyone starts the game with five face-down cards, with each player being able to choose and see two of their cards. Cards are numbered 0-13, with the number showing how many werewolves the character on that card attracts, and each character (number) has a different special power.<br/><br/>On a turn, you draw the top card of the deck or discard pile, then either discard it to use the power of the card (but only if it came from the deck), discard it without using the power (ditto), or replace one or more of your face-down cards with this card; you can replace multiple cards only if they bear the same number, and you must reveal the cards to prove this, being penalized if you're wrong.<br/><br/>Silver Eye can be played as a standalone game or combined with other games in the Silver series by B&eacute;zier Games. Each version of the game has different card abilities and a different silver token ability.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The God, who is no longer satisfied with the underworld, wants to send his monsters to the real world to expand his power.<br/><br/>The Players begin the game with 45 Timestones (life total) 10 starter cards, 6 of which grant seed power (purchase new cards) and 4 have song power (attack). As players buy GOTHIE (creature) cards and Land (shield) cards from the Mercado (tableau) they add them to their decks, where they can achieve synergy bonuses based on the heart rune of the cards played. The game plays similarly to other head-to-head deckbuilders in this respect, but can be converted to play cooperatively using the same deckbuilding mechanics.<br/><br/>In the coop mode, this plays very similar to a tower defense game like Castle Panic, but the threats all come from a single direction, and the monsters can attack the well and &quot;possess&quot; the GOTHIES that the players have in their played card zone. This ups the difficulty because the players' former GOTHIE cards now fight against them until they are restored.<br/><br/>The game is for 2 players, and can be expanded to 4 with two sets. The game comes with 162 cards and counters to track timestones.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The Council has adjourned from a meeting that has left the members&hellip;&hellip;at odds, to say the least. Having already been dispatched, you take the role of commander of a small strike force representing your race and its enthralling stake in an archaic space station orbiting Earth. Equipped with unique and outlandish weaponry, abilities of extraordinary and marvelous effect, and the luck of the die, you will battle other players and the perils on board the station in a race to complete your missions and grasp victory.<br/><br/>Game-Play: In Xenofaction, you control one of the many playable alien races with 3 four man squads at your disposal. Each with unique weaponry, abilities and styles of play. The board is made  of a hex grid making movement very easy and fluid. Weapons ranging is also based on this hex grid, for example; if a weapon has a range of 4, you count 4 hexs in the direction you are shooting from the attacking unit to the defending unit. The flow of game play if fluent and smooth as each unit completes its actions before you move to the next. Players take turns moving their units aboard the station and taking actions when necessary or desired. What stands out about Xenofaction is in between each players turn, another player will get the chance to control the station units (generally NPC's in a computer game). So instead of a computer autonomously controlling the actions of these type of units, players will get the chance to act as a sort of pseudo A.I. Action cards are used to create unique events and spur of the moment tactics, as well as useful items and bonuses to units.<br/><br/>Goal: The way to win in Xenofaction is to simply gain enough victory points. These points are gained by accomplishing numerous tasks. First there are universal missions you can try to complete that are active for every player. Each mission can only be completed by each player once, but another player completing a mission does not make it unavailable for others. Next is sometimes even more fun and necessary than the missions. Each unit you kill or destroy, except your own, gives you victory points, each being worth a designated amount. One thing to keep in mind, sometimes the station wins.<br/><br/>",

Created as a reconnaissance aircraft, it proved capable of undertaking a variety of roles: observation, light bombing, strafing ground targets, and escorting bombers. Introduced at the end of 1915, as an improvement of the successful earlier C.I model, it was produced in great numbers and used by many of Germany&rsquo;s allies. Its construction was so robust it remained in service until the end of the war, some C.IIIs surviving even after the Armistice.<br/><br/>Albatros C.III (Bohme/Ladermacher)<br/>Erwin B&ouml;hme was one of the great German aces, achieving his first victory in the Albatros C.III. He was unwillingly responsible for the tragic death of his friend, Oswald Boelcke.<br/><br/>Albatros C.III (Meinecke)<br/>When World War I started in 1914, Emil Meinecke joined the German Fliegertruppe and served first in Germany, then Turkey as an instructor and later as a combat pilot.<br/><br/>Albatros C.III (Luftstreitkr&auml;fte)<br/>Hundreds of C.IIIs were used in combat by the German Luftstreitkr&auml;fte and until 1917, this airplane proved extremely useful both on the Western and Eastern Front.<br/><br/>Each WW1 Wings of Glory&reg; Airplane Pack is a ready&ndash;to&ndash;play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Prepare yourself for the bizarre as you venture deep into a world of radioactive insanity!<br/><br/>Wasteman: A game of desperate conflicts in a desolate future! A frantic game, set amongst the ruins of a neglected and scorched earth. Engage in desperate battles between post-humans, hideous monstrosities and killer robots over the dregs of an age of gluttony. Take control of you own syndicate and test your metal against the weird and terrifying denizens of the wastes!<br/><br/>Wasteman is a fun, easy to learn, and refreshingly crazy game! Players or 'comrades' control syndicates, typically comprised of between 5 and 20 ruthless denizens of the wastes, in an attempt to vanquish their opponent, survive bizarre encounters and/or capture much needed supplies.<br/><br/>During a game of Wasteman, comrades take it turn to activate individual figures to perform several actions; such as attacking, moving, hiding or even bringing people back to life with the power of their mind in some cases! Figures can normally only be activated once per turn so you have real scope for strategy &ndash; goad your opponent into activating the wrong figure at the wrong time and they could be left open to all sorts of cunning shenanigans!<br/><br/>Once a syndicate drops below 5 figures they become desperate and the restriction for activating a figure only once in a turn is lifted. This leads to some really cinematic moments, where often lone survivors hopelessly attempt to fend off hordes of enemies and occasionally succeed! This really keeps the game fun right until the last man.<br/><br/>Figures take different kinds of damage &ndash; they can be spooked, crippled, seriously injured, or killed outright. To make it easier to remember what&rsquo;s happened, each figure comes with a base equipped with slots and removable tokens. These are cast in high quality resin and are included with all but the largest figures. Each figure will receive 1 base out of 10 designs selected at random.<br/><br/>M.A.D cards really bring the crazy to the game! Each comrade receives a hand of 5 M.A.D cards that can be played at any time (for the most part) to either help yourself or hinder your opponent. There&rsquo;s nothing quite like having the enemy boss abducted by aliens just before riding a conveniently timed tornado to the objective on the last turn! Though normally limited to 5 cards, you can seek the aid of traders or vending machines to top up your hand during a game leading to some very tense moment as your prize fighter sits in the middle of the battlefield kicking a coffee machine.<br/><br/>The cards themselves are lavishly illustrated by yours truly, and beautifully printed on quality playing card stock.<br/><br/>As well as a myriad of rules for hazards, mods to alter the game and a stockpile of scenarios, Wasteman has an in depth syndicate creation system, with loads of equipment, skills and Boss Rosters to choose from. Although each figure comes with a stat card, you are more than welcome to create your own and/or combine figures from different posse packs &ndash; the choices are vast!<br/><br/>Wasteman miniatures are sculpted by hand to approximately 35mm scale and will be cast in metal, unless specified to the contrary. All figures will come with stat cards and token slot bases. They will be supplied unpainted and, in some cases, unassembled.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Last Gamble, Designer Signature Edition is Danny Parker's final effort to create a memorable game on the Battle of the Bulge. The scale is conventional: 2 miles per hex, battalions and regimental units; two turns per day. However, the game has many innovations never before seen. Day and night turns differ dramatically both with respect to movement and the likelihood of decisive combat. All units are rated for Morale which can often be more important than combat strength. Forced marches and fluid zones of control at night are a major German offensive weapon while the Allied air effort influences German movement. The game has many previously unseen influences: V-1 weapons attacks, weather impacts on combat (and even zones of control) and bridge discovery.<br/><br/>As you would expect from a Danny Parker game the Order of Battle for both sides has been exhaustively researched (evaluated in a detailed numerical fashion) and several new units and many changes to others. Besides the new morale rules, armor superiority from the original has been retained although combined arms is enhanced and artillery influences are significantly changed. There are many changes to movement based on weather conditions.<br/><br/>The map in the original game included all of the villages in the Ardennes. The new map now includes not only those villages but also all the hamlets and castles. A study of the 1940 census has resulted in some towns being downgraded to villages and some village upgraded to towns. The contour lines in the original game are now gone and severe terrain has been added based on detailed evaluation using Google Earth. The map has been expanded to include more area in both the north and south. There are three maps with one smaller one devoted to the Battle Before the Meuse scenario<br/>The Game Booklet includes scenarios, Designer&rsquo;s Notes, Game Variants, Examples of Play and the Game as History. Also included is a Historical Background Booklet with Historical Analysis and Summary, Detailed Orders of Battle, Evaluation of Combat Strengths in the Ardennes and Design Bibliography. With more detailed historical background than any game to ever see print, TLG will also be a great reference tool.<br/><br/>More than just a reworking of the original game, this version is really a brand new game that has seen constant work for nearly five years by a dedicated team. The research on every aspect of the game has been truly monumental.<br/><br/>Of course there never will be a 'last word' in Bulge games, the subject is far too popular. But this game pushes the envelope far forward.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the not too distant future the world is ruled by massive corporations that wage war with each other over the control of empires. Literal wars fought by private armies proved to be overly costly in resources, profits, and public opinion, so the Wolf &amp; Phoenix Marketing Conglomerate introduced an out-of-the-box way for corporate entities to resolve their differences: The Hostile Takeover Arena. Corporations that have reached an impasse in negotiations can avoid expensive, lengthy legal battles or risky sabotage by simply hiring a team of trained warriors to out-maneuver the competition in a quick, bloody, ratings-exploding spectacle.<br/><br/>In Hostile Takeover, players control a mercenary team trying to outwit and outgun the competition. Each Character has strengths and weaknesses that must be wisely used to gain the upper hand. Can you lead your team of mercenaries to victory amid the chaos of battle?<br/><br/>Hostile Takeover is played on a modular board (usually 30&rdquo;x30&rdquo;) filled with 1&rdquo; Squares. Force fields and other terrain features are placed on the board to simulate a sci-fi battle arena. Players each use their team of 4 mercenaries to accomplish scenario specific objectives that earn them victory points. The first player to earn enough victory points (determined by scenario and number of players) is the winner. Each scenario is specifically designed to bring all teams together in a flurry of combat.<br/><br/>At the start of each Round players select an Action Card (Move, Melee, Fire or Aim/Overwatch) for each of their unwounded characters. Players also assign 4 Energy Tokens to their characters. Energy Tokens are used to boost the characters in a variety of ways and also enable the use of each character&rsquo;s unique Special Action. Players then roll for Initiative. Finally, players go in Initiative order activating 1 of their characters. This continues until all characters have acted or become pinned or wounded. There is a quick Clean Up step at the end of the round and then a new round begins.<br/><br/>Ranged and Melee Combat checks are handled by rolling 3d6 and trying to equal or exceed a given target number. Each Character has a chart describing their ranged and melee weapons that quickly and easily provides the target number to roll against based on a variety of factors.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Not quite Chinese Checkers:<br/><br/>&quot;It may interest readers to know that this game originated when the Inventor was faced with entertaining the Allied Forces during the last war so that they could, at least for an hour or two, be drawn away from thoughts of their normal surroundings. Having in a measure achieved his objective he set himself the task of making the game public, for the first time, in early December 1948, when King Kangaroo appeared for sale in the leading London Departmental Stores, such as Selfridges, Hamleys, Army &amp; Navy Stores, DH Evans, Bentalls, etc.<br/>King Kangaroo is therefore an entirely NEW GAME of which the Inventor holds the Patent and manufacturing rights as also the Copyrights of the rules for the United Kingdom and World Patents are pending.&quot;<br/><br/>The differences from the standard game are that the pieces cannot move at all without jumping, and can jump any number of adjacent pieces. There is also a single &quot;King Kangaroo&quot; piece per player, which functions slightly differently.<br/><br/>[Edit by Derek Carve:  Not &quot;brazen&quot; as [originally] implied above [point taken].  It is certainly played on a Chinese Checkers board but, come to that, many totally original games are played on a draughts board (Lines of Action is a good example) without being a re-packaging of draughts.   In this truly excellent game, as correctly explained, the pieces move totally differently from Chinese Checkers BUT one piece on each side - the King - has to be different from the rest in some way.  This is why it cannot be played with a standard set of Chinese Checkers unless, of course, one is prepared to paint some of the pieces.]<br/><br/>",

        "description": "POD stands for &quot;Power Of Direction.&quot;<br/><br/>A chess-like game, in that there are pieces with different movement rules moving around a square-grid board.  Each player has a &quot;king&quot; (the Communication and Command Pod, or C.C.P.) that must be captured for the opponent to win.  The board is 15-by-15 squares, divided into 9 5x5 sections.  And there is a repeating pattern of walls that restrict movement.  The basic movement mechanic is that each piece (individually called &quot;Pods&quot;) moves a given number of segments, called &quot;Direction Changes&quot; or D.C.'s.  For example, a piece with 3 D.C.'s could move forward as many spaces as it wants (subject to walls of course), then left as many spaces as it wants, and then forward again.  Pods must move their entire number of D.C.'s without backtracking.<br/><br/>In addition to the basic movement mechanic of D.C.'s, many of the pieces  have additional movement abilities, such as the Jump Pod (J.P.) that can jump over one piece during its movement, or the Variable Direction Change Pod (V.D.C.P.) which has a choice as to how many D.C.'s it may make when it moves.<br/><br/>There is a basic game (nine pods), and an advanced version which adds four more pods.  They give an even more advanced version (which they call &quot;POD Pinnacle&quot;) in which the nine board parts are set up in a non-standard way.  You can also combine two sets together for a four-player game (assuming the pieces are of four different colors), and presumably, you could combine even more sets together for as many players as you want, as long as you have some means of distinguishing each player's pieces from the others.<br/><br/>",

Players design their ships using parts and technologies to fit their particular strategy.  Once their ship is built, its time to start rolling and exploring the galaxy!<br/><br/>There are three types of ship parts, Cargo, Colony, and Engine, and four technology trees that can be used to specialize your ship.  At the start of the game players have a budget they spend to build their ship.  Each ship part is represented by a different d6 and how far a ship moves each turn depends on the role of the dice.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to amass the most credits.  Players earn money by discovering new locations, delivering miners to worlds they can mine, earning income from their colonists and delivering goods back to the Galactic Hub.

The world&rsquo;s mightiest heroes, sinister villains and mercenaries have all mobilized and are searching for magical relics that have the power to stop or advance the looming events. Krahgen is entering perilous times and it is going to take a coalition of heroes to save the world from the incoming threats. <br/>Lords of the Motleyverse is a 2-4 player, tactical, miniatures and dice skirmish game where players control squads of unique characters fighting for supremacy over treacherous battlefields. Every faction has a distinctive play style and every hero and villain is loaded with its own set of potent abilities. The game has ten built in scenarios and three different modes of play: Slaughter Box, King of the Arena and a Campaign mode. The object of the game is simple, destroy your opponents, collect relics, and be the last faction remaining on the board.<br/><br/>The combat system is built around rolling dice and creating attack sequences from the results. The attacking player rolls five dice and lines them up from left to right to create an attack sequence and the defending player must match the dice facings in the exact order that the dice are arranged, in three rolls or less. Each unblocked facing on the dice inflicts damage and most importantly determines the direction which enemy models are pushed. Learning to optimize your dice combinations and utilizing the layout of the board is the key to victory.<br/><br/>The game features a randomized activation order that tends to create high risk, high reward situations and continuously opens fresh avenues for new tactics and strategies. The arena is full of danger and players must pay heed to the terrain itself. Mobile saw blades, pits, spikes and man eating Skull Columns litter the field and have the capability to inflict massive amounts of damage.<br/><br/>Lords of the Motleyverse is a dynamic game of conflict and perseverance, packed full of action and mayhem, and designed to excel at casual and tournament play alike. The unpredictable activation order, specialized character abilities, vicious terrain features and ever changing circumstances guarantee that no game is ever the same.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Army of Italy (AOI) is the twelfth volume in the Lace Wars series and the second in a set of four dealing with the War of the Grand Alliance (1688-1697). This war, sometimes called the War of the League of Augsburg or the Nine Years War, was the second of the three great wars of Louis XIV. As a young man he waged the Dutch War to expand France's borders. This was a war of aggression. As an old man he fought the War of the Spanish Succession to put his grandson on the throne of Spain. Despite the King's ultimate aim this was a defensive war. The War of the Grand Alliance was Louis' war of middle age - a war of grinding attrition involving nearly a million men.<br/><br/>The war opened in Germany, but the Habsburgs, France's Great Enemy, also owned, or had suzerainty over, much of northern Italy. Coalition forces in Italy were weak, the Habsburg Emperor more concerned with his ongoing war against the Turks. However, the French could not spare many regiments for a second front. But, in 1689, the Spanish Habsburgs also declared war on France, fearing for their lands in the Low Countries. Unfortunately, this put their northern Italian possession of Milan squarely in King Louis' sights. This was a place the French felt they could take, but they would have to be quick about it. There was one potential obstacle: the House of Savoy.<br/><br/>Duke Victor II Amadeus was a French puppet. But, he was also a vassal of the Emperor. And, he coveted Milan for himself... The French planned to cross the Duke's lands, which straddled the western Alps, and launch their invasion of Milan from that state's borders. The mistake King Louis made was to assume Duke Victor would obey his will regardless of how he was treated. The arrogance of the French soldiers and their king combined with Duke Victor's self interest and Coalition gold to push him into the Allied camp. He refused access to the French and found himself at war with them. The Duke was a complex character. Young and valiant, he desired glory over the French in battle, but soon found himself outmatched while his allies proved unreliable. Yet at the same time, he understood how to dissemble and manipulate. What he could not achieve on the battlefield he accomplished in a backroom deal that bought him not only a separate peace with France in 1696, but command over the very French army he had been fighting for the past six years! It was he who led the invasion of Milan!<br/><br/>The war in Italy typified military campaigning in this period. Thwarted in their plans to invade Milan from Piedmont, the French attacked Duke Victor, spilling out of the alpine passes and across Piedmont. But, they could not establish a permanent base and had to withdraw. This flow and ebb was a feature of the early years. Sieges and battles were fought but none brought a lasting advantage to either side. In 1692 the Coalition in turn invaded France but found themselves plagued by the same problems that had beset the French. By 1694 the situation was deadlocked, both militarily and politically. However, on the political front, Duke Victor and King Louis were gradually approaching an accommodation. In 1695 the Sun King at last made some hard concessions. The following year Europe was shocked to learn Duke Victor had changed sides. His defection began the rush to peace, as the Powers tried to obtain the best deal possible for themselves.<br/><br/>In Army of Italy, you will have a chance to change history - and even if you cannot, perhaps you can win enough glory to write your name in the history books.<br/><br/>As the French, will you steamroller your ungrateful puppet state or simply make life so uncomfortable that she decides to join you after all? Then, the invasion of Milan can begin. The French Army is state-of-the-art. You have more artillery, the latest equipment (bayonets instead of pikes), and access to an administrative machine capable of supporting nearly 500,000 men. But you command a secondary front. Versailles will forever be taking regiments away from you, forcing you to rely on your wits. If you garrison every post, you will be too weak to go on the offensive. If you do nothing, you will lose the respect of the Sun King and the Court ladies.<br/><br/>As the Coalition, can you keep the French at bay? Or can you damage them enough to try a counter-invasion of France? Will the English send their fleet and land troops to aid you? Or, will the Holy Roman Emperor divert his attention from the Turks long enough to spare you some Imperial regiments. Duke Victor is not to be trusted. His actions belie his noble declarations. If you are not careful, the House of Savoy may surrender or even switch sides...<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>1) Five map sections representing the region of the Maritime Alps and the upper Po Valley at one league (4 Km) per hex. The fifth map shows the main area of conflict, allowing players to dispense with some of the maps for most scenarios, in case space is at a premium.<br/><br/>2) 840 die cut counters representing the forces of the French and their opponents - Savoyards, Huguenots, Waldensians, Spanish, Austrian, and German. Scale is Battalion - that is, the playing pieces represent battalions and regiments.<br/><br/>3) Rules, charts, tables, and display cards.<br/><br/>4) An historical commentary.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player will contribute to creating the graph (Candelsticks) of one (or more) quoted Financial Instrument, by playing cards from his hand. In his turn, the player can also decide to open or close positions, betting on the rise or fall of the Financial Instrument. The player will earn from the difference between the price at which he opened the position and the price at which he closes the position. <br/>It is essential to study the intentions of the opponents and hinder them while trying to position themselves strategically. Some Money Management cards help you to better manage your positions and hinder your opponents with the typical dynamics of drawing cards, having them discarded, spying or playing out of your turn. <br/>Attention instead to the Event cards that once drawn are activated and can upset the market (and the wallet of those who have risked too much). Of course, whoever earns the most wins.<br/><br/>The game is designed to have an elementary basic development that mirrors the development on the market of a financial instrument. The player is led to make delicate choices based on market trends, dealing with an emotional state and risk management that are typical of real operations.<br/><br/>In this sense, the game is designed so that statistically the rise in prices is slower than the relative descents (you go up the stairs and go down with the elevator). At the same time it will never be possible to know in a game, if you are in a bear market or a bull market as some random cards are removed from the deck at each game.<br/><br/>The entire game is designed to give food for thought and teaching. The possibility of comparison is in fact a competitive advantage that very often people in the financial world do not use due to the difficulty of dealing with such delicate issues as personal investments.<br/><br/>The possibility of comparison is continuously solicited by combining different financial instruments and players with market situations and risk appetites that are different for each of us.<br/><br/>",

The A-side of the unfinished album quickly became cult-followed by fans and critics around the world, turning into one of the most intriguing legends of rock-and-roll history. Fifty years later, the band has finally reunited to finish the B-side with the help of a team of the best musical producers in show biz. That's you!<br/><br/>In HiFi, players start their turn by spinning the record's rondel on the turntable to choose an action within their reach, or they can spend production points to achieve one of the other actions. After resolving these actions, players allocate audio cards to the five studio tracks, earning points based on the buttons in that producer's equalization track and what's in the studio track. When a player allocates a guitarist card, each player who collaborated with the equalization of the guitar earns points. When elements such as sound wave or time-track positions match, players can perform bonus actions.<br/><br/>Each round represents a song recorded on the A-side of the album that will help players gather information to aid B-side recordings. After listening to all of the songs on the A-side &mdash; 6-8 rounds depending on the player count &mdash; the game ends. Whoever contributed most effectively to the construction of the tracks on the album's B-side wins.<br/><br/>",

However, we felt that the game system did not allow enough room for tactical play and maneuvering and so a decision was made to make Conquest: First Blood! 2.0 a fully fledged competitive, skirmish wargame!<br/><br/>To do that we focused on the nuances of individual Model positioning and intra-Regiment synergies. The rules now treat individual teams of soldiers as building blocks together which form powerful ad-hoc formations. It is each player&rsquo;s job to find the weak point in their enemy&rsquo;s formation and disentangle it through smart maneuvering and intelligent order of play.<br/><br/>First Blood 2.0 also offer the opportunity to create a force from a faction you are interested in without committing to a full TLAOK army. A typical First Blood 2.0 Force consists of a single Character, 2-3 Officers (known as Command Models in TLAOK) and an average of about 20 soldiers. Expect every game entity to have about double their Wounds than their TLAOK equivalents, whilst point costs have been rehauled to better reflect the impact of certain Regiments in a smaller scale (and faster) game!<br/><br/>",

The same cards help you pick a location and a target. Then the first of five Acts begin. Each round the players flip a card from the deck, and explain how they use that ability to further the grand scheme. In Acts 1 and 3, everything is going according to plan. In Acts 2 and 4, everything is off the rails (though even your failures look cool). In the final Act 5, everything is up for grabs.

The solo mode is also included, in which you will try to face the Wild Hunt alone!<br/><br/>Introduces a new playable character for use only in this variant - Eredin, representing the Wild Hunt.<br/><br/>Wild Hunt is not just another character. It was specifically designed for this expansion and directing it gives you a whole new experience and range of decisions in gameplay. Both the components and mechanics emphasize the scale of the threat posed by these wraiths of Aen Elle.<br/><br/>This expansion also includes a playmat along with 4 miniatures of the Generals - Eredin, Nithral, Caranthir, and Imlerith! Each of these Generals is assigned to one of four colors of cards. After playing the corresponding colors, Wild Hunt moves the Generals forward on the track. By doing so, he gains experience and victory points, but most importantly, he gains access to special Ability cards for Generals, through which he can hinder the game for his opponents.<br/><br/>The other players will cooperate, side by side facing a powerful opponent! Scoring Victory Points collectively, they will do their best to prevent Ciri's abduction. <br/>In addition to earning Victory Points together, players also cooperate in the battle against the Generals - by playing cards of the appropriate color, they can weaken the Generals, moving them back on the track. They receive General Weakness cards for doing so, which they can use to increase their chances in the competition.<br/><br/>There are also entirely new Side Quests for Wild Hunt and cooperating players.<br/><br/>The Wild Hunt expansion also offers solo gameplay - you will take on the role of Ciri or one of her companions to face the Wild Hunt governed by Automa. For the purposes of solo gameplay, we have prepared a special Hunt board, as well as 4 bonus cards, replacing the Generals' Weakness cards.

        "description": "STEERY is all about storytelling. Players work together to build a story about one or more characters, and they score points based on their contribution to the story.<br/><br/>It consists of character cards and story cards. The first player starts the story by revealing a character card, introducing the character in the story, and playing one story card from their hand to get the ball rolling. From then on, players take turns in moving that story forward by playing one story card each, incorporating the concept of the card they're playing in the story, and scoring points along the way.<br/><br/>STEERY found the balance between strategic and casual gameplay and the sweet spot between collaboration and competition. The game has also been designed to be family friendly, but it can easily take a NSFW turn if players wish to go that way.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the pulisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Unconditional Surrender! Western Campaigns (USWC) is an strategic-level game covering World War 2 campaigns fought between the Axis and Western Allied factions in Western Europe. With its emphasis on force projection, players focus on the big picture of managing their military forces. Using simple mechanics and low on-map counter density, players easily handle the action without complicated subsystems or tall stacks of counters.<br/><br/>Plucked from the game Unconditional Surrender! WW2 in Europe (USE), USWC provides shorter, smaller footprint scenarios for those wanting to play the Unconditional Surrender! design but lacking the space and time needed for the much larger USE. USWC also serves as an alternative way to teach it to other players. Owners of USE that have the space and time for it, do not have to buy this game. However, it may be worth it, if you are looking for something much more portable to bring somewhere else to play or for an inexpensive gift for a wargaming friend.<br/><br/>DESIGN HIGHLIGHTS:<br/><br/>Low On-Map Counter Density: The number of counters on the map is incredibly low.<br/>Simple Stacking: No more than one of the same type of unit per hex.<br/>No Factors on Counters: No combat or movement factors on counters.<br/>Single Combat System: One combat resolution sequence and Combat Results Table covers all types of combat, yet the results differ for air or ground combat.<br/>Integrated Movement &amp; Combat System: Units move and fight in a combined activation.<br/>Ergonomically Friendly: Easily fits in extremely limited gaming space.<br/>&quot;Use it or lose it.&quot; Economic System: Simple math with minimal record keeping.<br/>Easy to Modify: The relatively simple mechanics make it easy to modify the game.<br/>Unconditional Surrender! World War 2 in Europe Compatibility: The ground and air units, event markers, and combat system are the same in both games. The scenarios are similar except for the elements that were abstracted. If you later decide to play USE, you will have additional rules to learn but little to unlearn.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: Monthly Turns<br/>MAP SCALE:  30 to 40 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE: Army, Fleet, or Wing<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS: 2<br/><br/><br/>COMPONENT LIST <br/>6 8.5&quot;x11&quot; maps<br/>1 Countersheet<br/>1 Rules Booklet<br/>1 Play Book<br/>2 11&quot;x17&quot; Player Aid cards<br/>1 Faction Card<br/>2 6-sided dice<br/>Game Box<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Centuries is a card drafting, deck building card game.<br/><br/>Taking place during the turbulent but exciting Renaissance, players take on the role of a leader of a city of Renaissance Europe.  Players try to construct a Major Construction within their city, collect resources, expand the their treasuries, enlarge armies, develop technology, build structures, establish trade, and colonize the world, sometimes with the help of notables like Leonardo DaVinci or Queen Elizabeth.  Be the Leader who exceeds what other Leaders can do and become victorious!<br/><br/>Played in three Centuries, players collect resource cards in order to afford other cards that in turn award the player with victory points.  A key mechanic involves deciding which cards to pass to the other Players and which to keep in a modest supply deck.  Modular in nature, Players can play from 3 - 6 modules.  With the 3 module game, a fun and fairly short game can be enjoyed even by novice players.  With the full game, Players enjoy a challenging game that will stretch the skills of the most hardened strategist.<br/><br/>Cards are lavishly decorated with the great works of art from the Renaissance and can be played in multiple ways:  either in a basic manner or with an added bonus, played to build the major construction, passed, kept to enlarge the supply deck, or discarded for money.<br/><br/>Centuries is a fast-paced, strategy card game with limitless replayability with no game playing exactly the same.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Clouds of Glory (ICOG)is a tabletop air wargame that recreates aerial combat during the World War One. The game was developed in Denmark the 90's by 3 friends with a common passion for the WWI &quot;Knights of the Air&quot;.<br/><br/>The game features true 3-D action with accurate models of all the greatest planes of this era: SPADs, Sopwiths, Fokkers, Pfalz&acute;es, Nieuports, Hannovers, Rumplers, Albatrosses, Bristols, Gothas, Zeppelins, S.Es...<br/><br/>The game represents individual plane movement and individual pilots. <br/>Each plane is represented by a 1/350 scale model with at 360 deg. nose mount that allows the model to be positioned in all directions. The nose mount is then itself mounted on a four foot long pole made of carbon fibre. The plan can then be moved up and down the pole, thus denoting actual height - No altitude markers here. The pole is sharpened and set directly into the foam gameboards. See pictures.<br/><br/>Each plane also has a &quot;Cockpit&quot; sheet to which the Pilot sheet is attached and where the data (and possible special rules)on each plane type is represented. On the cockpit sheet also contains a speed indicator telling the current speed of the plane, and indicating the amount of energy the plane currently posses. This energy level tells how tigth the plane can turn and its ability to climb or dive. Going fast equals the ability to zoom high up, but turns are wide. Going slow allows for tighter turning but severely limits your ability to get out of trouble by zoom climbing and thus limits the tactical options. In this game speed is life.<br/><br/>Piloting skill can make planes turn tigther than their speed normally allows for, but this drains speed and at higher speeds also stresses the airframe, thus creating a risk of breaking of important bits such as the wings.<br/><br/>The &quot;Cockpit&quot; sheet is also where you record damage to the plane: Structural damage, damage to maneuverability, armament, engine and so on.<br/><br/>Each pilot has a set of 3 basic skills: Awareness (situational awareness), Piloting (ability to make tight turns, avoid or recover from spins and stalls)  and Gunnery (hitting your target). A pilots skills are decided by rolling 2d6+6. Pilots also has 2 attributes: Fortitude (hit points and ability to figth when wounded) and Luck (Denotes number of dice re-rolls and Used to check for collisions) found by rolling 3d6. With experience pilots gain better skills as well as possible &quot;Ace abilities&quot; such as Divine luck, Deflection shooting, Aerobatics and so on.<br/><br/>Skill and attribute checks are done with a d20 against a basic target number (for example Skill or Attribute level) modified by conditions (for example deflection angle or target speed). The difference between the target number needed and a the number rolled on a successful check denotes the success level which is then carried on as a modifier to the damage roll.<br/><br/>The full rules including, missions and Cockpit panels and more can be downloaded for free here:http://icog.dk/ICOG/Download.html<br/><br/>1/350 scale planes can be acquired as 3D prints(or hand build in styrene as you see on many of the pictures). A large selection of planes is available for the game.

However, a rumor claims that the Czar&rsquo;s favorite daughter, Anastasia, survived and has been in hiding from those that are pursuing her. Her Grandmother, the Empress Dowager, heard the rumors and decided to make it her mission to find Anastasia. After years of searching, the Empress invited those who claim to be or know Anastasia to a party, where the Empress hopes to learn enough to find Anastasia.<br/><br/>GAME OVERVIEW<br/>One player is the Empress, while the rest of the players are guests. To find Anastasia, the Empress and her guests must ask questions of each other. The responses are marked on a central board for all players to see. By listening to the answers and exchanging hidden clue cards with each other players must deduce who is and isn&rsquo;t Anastasia. As questions are answered, gems are given to players. The gems can be used on a player&rsquo;s turn to perform actions such as gaining clues, revealing roles, or asking additional questions.<br/><br/>The game continues until Anastasia is found or a role ability causes the game to end. Will the Empress find Anastasia? Will Rasputin's Agent find Anastasia first? What other guests will show up to this party? Play Finding Anastasia to find out.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1914: Dispatches is the first issue of Oregon ConSim Journal (a Charles S Roberts Award winning magazine), is a support magazine that focuses on the Eastern Front during 1914 by expanding on the CSR Award winning WWI simulation game 1914: Twilight in the East (TitE).<br/><br/>During the design of 1914 TitE a great deal of research material was accumulated that was not incorporated due to space (and time) limitations. The Journal allows some of this material to be brought to light, more thoroughly covering the fascinating 1914 time period. The centerpiece of the publication is a collection of three well-researched historical articles that are paired with new scenarios allowing the subject to be accurately simulated.<br/><br/>The time period October&ndash;November 1914 contained two distinct campaigns that culminated in very large battles fought in Russian Poland: The Battle of Ivangorod and Battles of Lodz and Krakau. These battles are the topics chosen for two of the scenarios found in the journal. The first, &ldquo;The Battle of Ivangorod,&rdquo; is a small introductory scenario that covers the time period 22&ndash;26 October when the Austro-Hungarian First Army unsuccessfully fought to clear the Russians from their Vistula River bridgeheads at Ivangorod and Kozienice.<br/><br/>Following the Battle of Ivangorod, in early November the German high command acted to regain the operational initiative and protect Germany from the ravages of invasion. Using their excellent railroad network to transfer large bodies of troops, they launched an offensive to penetrate deep into the main Russian forces&rsquo; flank and rear. The epic operation is the subject of the Journal&rsquo;s second scenario, &ldquo;The Battles of Lodz and Krakau.&rdquo; This expert scenario, intended for veteran players, is huge, requiring all five maps and almost the entire counter mix.<br/><br/>A well known military axiom states: mistakes made in the deployment of troops at the start of operations cannot be righted in the course of the whole campaign. At the outset of WWI this was true for all fronts but nowhere was it more pertinent than on the Eastern Front. The Journal&rsquo;s third article, &ldquo;Austria-Hungary&rsquo;s Botched Deployment in 1914&rdquo; concentrates on that nation&rsquo;s botched initial strategic deployment.<br/><br/>The game strategy article Playing Both Sides in Galicia details successful opening moves on the Galician front. Based on years of gameplay experience by the designer, the article presents a corps-by-corps breakdown of Austro-Hungarian and Russian armies and offers tested solutions for the challenges they face.<br/><br/>Rounding out the contents are two enhanced, professionally-produced Player Aid Cards designed to speed combat resolution in 1914, Twilight in the East.<br/><br/>Journal Contents (64 pages):<br/><br/><br/>    The Austro-Hungarian Army and National Identity 1867&ndash;1914<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Austria-Hungary&rsquo;s Botched Deployment in 1914<br/>        associated scenario: The Austro-Hungarian Deployment Plan as of Winter 1913/14 (18 counters to be mounted - see expansion counters)<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>    Playing Both Sides in Galicia &mdash; Galicia Campaign Strategies<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Prelude to Ivangorod<br/>        associated scenario: The Battle of Ivangorod (introductory scenario GT 28-29)<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>    The Lodz Campaign: Defeating the Russian Steamroller<br/>        associated scenario: The Battles of Lodz &amp; Krakau (complete scenario GT 36-47)<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>    The Polish Legion in 1914<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Revised Victory Conditions for the Grand Campaign scenario<br/><br/><br/>Also included: Two replacement Player Aid Cards for 1914, Twilight in the East<br/><br/>See preview pages.<br/><br/>(Source: publisher and BGG user)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "War of Ashes: Shieldwall is the latest offering from the designers of This Quar&rsquo;s War and Songs of our Ancestors. Concentrating on command and position instead of unit statistics and abilities, WoA: Shieldwall provides simple rules that bring with them difficult decisions.<br/><br/>Taking the gritty tactics and concepts of the Dark Ages and setting them in the whimsical world of Agaptus, WoA: Shieldwall begins with the Roar Phase in which both sides rally their line and taunt their opponent. The goal of which is generating Froth, a resource used throughout the game to bend the rules and adjust position in the line.<br/><br/>To represent the flowing nature and chaos of the battlefield, WoA: Shieldwall utilizes a blind random activation system in which the commander never quite knows how far he can push his fighters before the momentum of the battle passes to his opponent.<br/><br/>Once two lines have met, the fighting begins. Unlike most ranked unit games, casualties are removed from the point of contact and the lines begin to merge. Each slain opponent brings with him a decision &ndash; advance and break their line, or hold and preserve your Shieldwall!<br/><br/>",

The Herman Goring Division moved south to help 16th Panzer as did 15th Panzer Grenadier and held the British back from moving north.  While they tried to push the British back the British were too well supplied with heavy weapons and naval gunfire support.  The British were funneled into the passes between the hills leading north and a heavy attack could not be sufficiently concentrated to be successful.<br/><br/>The rules are written using the Seven Battlefield Operating Systems as a framework.  They are Maneuver, Command and Control, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Combat Service Support, Intelligence, and Air Defense.  They are not complex and make the game easier to understand than most large games.  Putting all 4 games together creates a monster of monster games.  All together having 4 Allied divisions at company level and 5 German divisions at platoon level.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bionic is a paragraph driven solo adventure game set in an alternate future where those with the resources have become half-machine. Super corporations rule the world from elaborate orbital stations while gangs, governments and citizens struggle to survive on the ever worsening surface of Earth.<br/><br/>In this game you create an Android who is employed by the largest augmentation corporation in the universe - Cyber Tech Revolutions Ltd. Each game you select a Contract from the Data Archives to complete, which will have you exploring the city of Kinacha (divided into Upper Kinacha and Lower Kinacha) completing the tasks set forth by your employer.<br/><br/>The game utilizes a roll and keep mechanic. For any given task there will be a difficulty number and based on your skills and attributes you will roll a certain number of 10-sided dice and then may select to keep a certain number. If your final result is above the TN you act recklessly, below the TN is cautious and matching the TN is the ideal outcome.<br/><br/>The game has been divided into 5 Chapters for ease of printing and playing. Each Chapter will slowly add more mechanics to the game building on the core of Chapter 1 and the Contracts in each successive Chapter build on the story of those occurring before it:<br/><br/>Chapter I is an introduction to the Bionic world and in particular the city of Kinacha.<br/><br/>Chapter II introduces a more fluid Encounter deck (with more cards that can be permanently removed as well as cards that only get added when you achieve certain goals), a new game board (Lower Kinacha) and allow access to the Underground via the Underground Access Status card. Chapter II focuses on the gang war in Lower Kinacha.<br/><br/>Chapter III takes place in the Underground proper and introduces a secondary Encounter Deck and a secondary Item Deck for this purpose.<br/><br/>Chapter IV expands upon what is already in place, and mostly adds a large number of new contracts to move the story towards the conclusion. This story arc features many decision points in the Contracts that will affect future Contracts.<br/><br/>Chapter V is the conclusion, and knowing what the additional components are would be a spoiler!<br/><br/>",

You are a prospector from humble beginnings who has journeyed far and wide in search of your fortune. With only a few tools and basic resources, you start mining in hopes of striking it rich. In this wild west, gold-mining, city-building card game, you quickly find that you must be tenacious!<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s only so much gold in the hills and you must compete with rival prospectors to claim it. This deckbuilding game starts out relatively simple and becomes progressively more complex. Players begin the game with identical decks of cards that consist of basic resources such as labor, brick, lumber, food, and silver. They can use silver and eventually gold to trade these resources for more advanced resources in the market such as pickaxe, guns, leather, and paper. Different combinations of these resources allow players to purchase event cards, wanted cards, and building cards. As a result, these cards give individuals easier access to gold and provide a specified number of victory points.<br/><br/>To outmatch your opponents, your strategy may consist of cunning intellect or brutal aggression. Be the architect of a sluice box, which reduces the amount of labor needed to mine gold, or build a gangster hideout to attack your opponents. When all of the gold is mined, the player with the most victory points wins and becomes the legendary boomtown tycoon!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battlemind is a medieval-themed battle strategy game in which two players, each with 10 character cards, try to capture/kill the other player's King. Inspired by the game from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire fantasy novels (HBO's Game of Thrones is based on this series), Battlemind combines the strategic elements of Chess, Stratego, and Blitzkrieg to create a an easy to learn but hard to master game with infinite replayability. This game is for anyone who loves strategy games - not just fans of the books!<br/><br/>What makes Battlemind special? Instead of being played like a typical card game (dealing/drawing), it is played more like a board game, with players setting up a &quot;board&quot; made of terrain cards and moving character cards across them.<br/><br/>Like chess, each character card has a certain number of spaces in which it can move. But that's where the similarities end. Each character has a strength value (1-8) which dictates whether it can capture/kill another character as well as certain advantages and disadvantages over other characters. From the lowly Rabble (rabble is like an angry mob) to the powerful Dragon, every unit has a purpose.  How you use them is up to you!<br/><br/>Finally, each terrain type can benefit or hinder your character. Use terrain to slow your enemy down, protect your fortress, and even hide from Dragons!<br/><br/>Ultimately, how you set up your terrain, arrange your army, and advance your units will determine whether you will be the victor or the vanquished. You'll laugh at your opponent when he places a crucial unit on his front line that you are able to capture easily, but will be crushed when that same placement allows him to capture your dragon on his first move in the next game!<br/><br/>Will you create a defensive stronghold and make your advesary come to you?  Or will you storm the front lines in hopes of catching your opponent off guard?<br/><br/>It's your decision.  The fate of the Kingdom rests on your shoulders. Fight for honor.  Fight for glory.  But remember: in the game of Battlemind, every move can mean victory or crushing defeat.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>In Wizard&rsquo;s WARdrobe, you take the role of an apprentice wizard who has busted in to the Grand Wizard&rsquo;s magical WARdrobe to battle other wizards for epic loot. Each player starts with 99 Hit Points, two learned spells in hand, and a wizard inventory playmat with 8 color &amp; number-coded body locations for items (2 feet, 2 body, 2 hands, 1 head &amp; as many accessories [trinkets or familiars] as you want). During your turn you allocate 3 actions to cast spells, use items, and grab items from the 8 face-up WARdrobe piles. The more powerful the effect, the more actions it costs, so keep an eye out for boots and familiars that can give you extra actions.<br/><br/>Gear Up!<br/>The more items you are wearing, the harder you are to hit. The innovative hit roll system supports the theme nicely: When a wizard deals damage to other wizards, they roll an 8-sided hit die and refer to the hit location on each affected players&rsquo; playmat. If the wizard has an item in that location, it is moved to the junk pile and no damage is dealt. If the wizard does not have an item in that location, then the damage is rolled and dealt to the wizard&rsquo;s HP.<br/><br/>Throw Down!<br/>There is a vast repertoire of offensive and defensive effects in the base game (over 200 cards), with more to come in the preset expansion boosters. Once your wizard is suited up with synergetic buffs, you are ready to use your spells and items to attack your opponents and defend yourself. The last wizard standing wins!<br/><br/>Wizard&rsquo;s WARdrobe is quick to set up and very easy to learn: the game pieces laid out almost teach the game itself. It is fast-paced (you can start slinging right off the bat) yet still highly strategic (with dozens of spells and 8 WARdrobe piles to choose equipment from, there are many lines of play). So far, in the hundreds of private and public playtests at conventions and stores, almost every game has been unique and exciting. The few games that weren&rsquo;t we used to refine the game to its current 5th version, which is running super smooth, fun, and balanced.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monsters, Don&rsquo;t Treat Them Gently! incorporates the Monsters and Protagonists from the short stories of the 19th century to early 20th  century celebrated English ghost writer, M. R. James. The game is set in the fictional parish of Barchester and features 20 typical locations from James&rsquo; stories. The game is introduced by means of a mysterious letter which informs the reader that they must lead a team of courageous people to fight back against the malevolent forces that threaten to overtake Barchester. The game can be played with basic rules or with a host of tactical rules as player&rsquo;s become used to the flow of the game. A player can play a solitaire game where they control the Protagonists with the aim of banishing the Monsters to claim victory (the Monster being played by A.I. mechanics in the game). Alternatively a 2 player game can be played where one side takes control of the Protagonists and the other side the Monsters. Both sides choose a starting team of 15 from their decks; each card has 4 attribute statistics. Each turn take place at a different location, which may allow counters to be played or benefits to accrue. The Protagonist cards can be equipped with Boon cards that can be found at the various locations. The turn has 4 phases: organise, initiate, engage and resolve. The Protagonist and Monster players take alternate turns to hold the location and decide the type of encounter, which is kept secret from their opponent. The responding player must try and guess what strategy is being used and play their hand accordingly. The controlling player can see the card images but not the statistics, so uses their knowledge to try and play the best cards to win the encounter. The cards are then revealed and the statistics compared. An encounter table is consulted to determine the outcomes. The Monster cards can also be played as a stand-alone trump-style game, &ldquo;Monsters &amp; Miscreants.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

Even if you don't play using dragons, there are many useful cards you could use.  Overall, I love this set for the same reasons I loved Artifacts: expantion on a theme.  Now, you rarely see a tourney of fun deck without at least 1 dragon.  Landmark Cards: Lair of the Shadowdrake (#3); Mount Deismaar (#9); Dragon's Horde (#10); Dragon Raid!

Each year constitutes a game round, divided in 4 seasons, in which players may take action. Players will have to gather resources, improve their cities and tribe, explore the seas, build armies and fight against other Viking and Christian empires, to ultimately reach their fate and triumph over their opponents.<br/><br/>Battles are based on hero, unit and combat cards. Units and modifiers enhance the strength of combat cards, that are then played from the hand in succession until a contender wins. Heroes serve as generals, giving the owner unique skills and better combat cards. Fighting is a key point in the game, since it leads to conquest, plunder and glory.<br/><br/>Starting from a small coastal village, players will create great overseas domains and lead their people to greatness, developing their nation with the riches their raids and trades will provide.  They will command great armies and famed heroes, proving their worth on the battlefield and earning the favor of the gods. They will have to outshine every opponent and take their place in the sagas.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Taoex is an abstract strategy game where players use mono-directional tiles to navigate a hexagonal grid to capture opponents&rsquo; tiles to create multi-directional towers for greater mobility. Using the 6-pointed compass, that control all direction of play, located in the center of the board, players take turns placing their 12 tiles (2 for each compass direction) in the optimum starting hexes. Once all the 36 starting hexes have been filled the game begins with the players taking turns advancing at least 1 tile into play per turn. Within the board there is a 6-pointed star called The Way where tiles are forced to roll the 10-sided Taoex die to charge the path a tile/tower moves across the board. Regardless of whether the roll is beneficial to the rolling player, the tile must move the roll along the Way if it can. Tiles/towers that traverse board to the far side of the board, if the tile/tower manages to line up with a starting hex, the tile/tower can wrap around the board to come out on the other side once again. An excellent tactic when hunting new directions.<br/><br/>As players begin collecting enemy tiles, by landing on them, they form towers of up to 6 tiles tall, maximum. Anything over 6 tiles the tower&rsquo;s owner either removes enemy tiles from play or in the case of his own, liberates them and returns them to an open starting hex of the appropriate direction of the tile. The game is won by a player collecting 6 of one enemy&rsquo;s tiles into a single tower or, if 1 player captures/eliminates all opponent tiles.<br/><br/>Taoex is a challenging and unique abstract strategy game that is very simple to learn and yet offers the players a mental workout as they master their play. Naturally, the rules that govern the game are more complex than the description written above, but it is the nuances in the rules that makes all games more interesting and Taoex offers its fair share. If you are the kind of gamer that enjoys using your mind to defeat opponents rather than just relying upon some lucky dice roll or random chance, then Taoex is a game for you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Goblin Cave is an asymmetrical team-based tactics game featuring strategic, card-based combat driven by unique character abilities and player decisions.<br/><br/>Each player takes control of two unique characters, drawing cards with powerful abilities and moving freely around the board. Players will control tactical locations, place traps, launch fireballs, destroy walls, teleport across pits, climb ledges, sling arrows, swing great-axes, steal relics, and much, much more!<br/><br/>Each team of players has their own win conditions, and will go toe-to-toe with their opponents to achieve them through fast-paced strategy-fueled combat. Adventurers traverse the Goblins&rsquo; cave in order to steal Relics&mdash;objects of great arcane power. Goblins must defend their homes from the greedy invaders who are trying to steal their relics, navigating the cave through tunnels only they can use! Each team is comprised of unique characters with rich lore and powerful specialized abilities, not unlike a board game version of a MOBA (like League of Legends) or hero shooter (like Overwatch or Apex Legends).<br/><br/>Players control two characters simultaneously. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they draw an ability card from each character's ability deck, roll a die for each character&rsquo;s movement, then move and use an ability card for each character, in any order they wish. The game ends either when all characters on a team are incapacitated, when the Adventurers escape with a relic, or when 10 rounds have passed.<br/><br/>With 10 playable characters, multiple cave maps, and several planned expansions, Goblin Cave offers a great deal of replayability and long-term support.<br/><br/>",

From the bloody last days of the Japanese on Guadalcanal to the frustrating static warfare on Bougainville.<br/><br/>We witness some of the last and largest Banzai attacks on Guam and Saipan. The close and dirty work of clearing Japanese cave networks on Peleliu and then things come full circle as the Allies return to liberate the Philippine Islands.<br/><br/>For The Emperor, Battlepack is all about the Imperial Japanese Army, and the US Military forces.

The combined American-British-Dutch-Australian fleet resisted as best they could, but would be crushed in February 1942 in the Battle of the Java Sea.<br/><br/>Java Sea is a Second World War at Sea series game based on this bold Japanese aggression. There are 180 &ldquo;long&rdquo; playing pieces, depicting the major fleet units of both sides: battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers and fleet destroyers. There are also 340 square playing pieces, half the size of the ship pieces, mostly depicting aircraft but also smaller warships and markers. The game uses the maps and playing pieces from the old&nbsp;Strike South&nbsp;game, but otherwise is completely new with additional playing pieces, a completely new set of 40 scenarios, and Second Edition series rules with full-color play aids.<br/><br/>The two operational maps depict the South China Sea and the East Indies, including all the major ports and airbases. The area covered stretches from Formosa on the north to Australia on the South. The maps overlap with that from&nbsp;Eastern Fleet&nbsp;on the west edge, and stretch to New Guinea on the east where they overlap with those from&nbsp;South Pacific.<br/><br/>All of the battles of the Japanese Strike South are included: the battle of Java Sea and Sunda Strait and Badung Strait, the last cruise of the British battleship&nbsp;Prince of Wales, and many more. There are some what-if variations, like the addition of an aircraft carrier to the British Force Z. The Royal Thai Navy is fully present, along with the French squadron they battled at Koh-Chang in 1940.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

So, the magician, Wanda Wands, may use her wild Wands Props to add points to her Rabbit Trick.<br/>   Magician's are sneaky and may play SNEAKY cards to gain minor advantages over their opponents, such as pick pocketing Props cards from another magician's hand. <br/>   Perform each trick once and add up the scores to see who will win Magician's Challenge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the hybrid chess game 'POWER62&reg;DELTA', your objective is to capture the opponents' EPK (Eranium Processor Key) or eliminate the opponent's Emperor. Players start out on opposing sides of the playing board placing their characters &mdash; EPK, PTxCreatures, BLACK HOLE and Terrain Obstacle pieces &mdash; in a pre-set position. From there they take turns trying to out-strategize their opponent to win the game.<br/><br/>There's only one strategy game that has withstood the test of time: CHESS. Using that as a foundation, we built up a set of new gameplay mechanics to create the next generation of chess. Unlike in chess, the movement of your pieces are controlled by a deck of Move Cards. For additional offensive and defensive capabilities, the Power Cards help randomize gameplay. And then, there are dangerous obstacles like Terrain Obstacles to worry about, and the SPR-8 Markers are the Mother of All Game Changers for each player. It's like chess on steroids. Finally obstacles like Black Holes and Terrain/Obstacles, featuring some of the exoteric landscapes and flora seen in our soon-to-be-released online comic! (Coming 12/2021).<br/><br/>Another innovation for the game play is the added QR code in the cards to help define the movement of the piece, quickly.Even if you play the same deck multiple times, the outcome will differ. &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot; on the Move cards, Power cards and SPR-8 markers has a huge factor in whether your strategy works or crumbles.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Great business opportunity awaits the most enterprising merchants.<br/><br/>Who will be the richest of the square (the winner), in the end?<br/><br/>As a trader, each player on their turn can open new stalls (place one or more stall-tiles) following the strict municipal rules or bring new customers to the market (move a customer). In the city, customers have a somewhat extravagant and habitual behavior: they always walk straight ahead until they meet stalls, then they always turn around counterclockwise; they buy clothes and shoes in any order, but only vegetables or fish after buying vegetables, and only other fish, after they buying fish. Obviously customers buy only products that are on their shopping list.<br/> Try to open your stalls in strategic position and keep an eye on price trends: the best selling goods will be more expensive in the next rounds. But stalls of a goods type can inflate that goods.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, beware of thieves, workers, policeman and many other characters that could benefit (or damage) your (or opponents) business: You have action disks that can be spent to pick-up and/or use special actions of such characters.<br/><br/>Be careful to plan your actions in time, as the market is divided into phases, marked by the opening of increasingly modern stalls: during the game the old stalls will be scrapped. When all the stalls are exhausted or when at least one of the goods has reached the maximum price, the market will be closed and the game will be over.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is for a player or team to have the most points at the end of 10 rounds. These points are mostly gained by defeating enemy units. Each tribe has multiple units that can be summoned onto the board to be used in combat. These units have unique abilities that can be charged and cast with the use of the resource called Power Crystals. As more units come out onto the field, players will roll additional dice to increase their base stats and other core actions. Half-way through the game, the ground becomes unstable and starts to collapse in on itself. At this point, players will start their turn by flipping two tiles from the outside of the board, forcing battle into the Crystal Mines in the center of the board. Gnomes and Wizards is a game that is easy to learn but is hard to master and can be played with a wide variety of skill levels.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tri To Win is the thiathlon card game where players build their own board game to race on.<br/><br/>It is played in two phases. In the first phase of the game players draw and play one card per turn to build up their athletes&rsquo; skills, create the race courses, and a little bit of card and skill thievery. Skill cards are played face down next to your athlete, only you know what skills you have. All other cards are played face up, the Course cards are played along the corresponding course. Action cards are used to cause some mischief, with Action cards you can steal skills, cards, remove pieces of the race course and stop other players actions. Phase one ends when a player uses their turn to play the 'Start The Race' card at the end of the running course.<br/><br/>In phase two, players use their accumulated skills to race on the course they made in phase one. The Course cards are used as a board game with coloured player tokens that match each athlete. Add up all skills your athlete has gathered and these are now your movement points. Each player takes turns moving their token the number of swim points they have, then cycling, then running, stopping at each race transition until their next turn. The winner is the first player to make it past the finish line to the Gold 1st place position at the end of the running course. Keep playing to find out who comes 2nd and 3rd!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

But loyalties can change at any moment, including your own!<br/><br/>Based on the hit animated series from Robert Kirkman, Corey Walker, and Ryan Ottley, this game puts you in the position of either a hero or an astronaut attempting to escape Mars and make it back to Earth without bringing a world-destroying parasite home with you. No pressure!<br/><br/>Each round players will be faced with an obstacle that they must overcome as a group. On their turn, a player may contribute a card to the obstacle, place a card on their own personal setback, or play a card for a special ability. At the end of each round players will resolve the obstacle in either an astronaut victory, a sequid victory, or a neutral outcome. If the astronauts or sequids achieve 3 victories they immediately win. If neither team reaches 3 victories before round seven, players have a chance to launch the rocket. Every player that has completed their personal setback boards the rocket and attempt to make it back to Earth. Before the launch though, players will have one final chance to vote off any infected players that have infiltrated the rocket.<br/><br/>Depending on skill level, players may elect to play a simple game as an astronaut trying to escape Mars, or a more challenging game as one of 9 unique superheros attempting to protect those astronauts. Superheroes have more power, but they&rsquo;re playing a tougher game. You know what they say about power, responsibility, etc. Each player&rsquo;s choice to be an astronaut or hero makes no change to the overall balance of the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ithaqua the Wind-Walker is an expansion for Cthulhu: Death May Die. This box brings a brand-new Elder One for you to use in combination with any Episode (from any Season!) creating a whole new gaming experience as you try to vanquish the perils of the Wind-Walker and his Shantak followers!<br/><br/>The Ithaqua the Wind-Walker box comes with:<br/><br/><br/>     1 Ithaqua figure<br/>     2 Shantak figures<br/>     8 Mythos cards<br/>     5 Elder One cards<br/>     Tokens<br/><br/><br/>Ithaqua, the son of Hastur and Lord of the Winds is a powerful Great Old One in his own right; a horrifying giant that stalks the frozen wastes and slays whoever he comes across in pursuit of his goal to free the other Great Old Ones. His is the power to gather and control blizzards and violent snowstorms, and it is no different in Death May Die, for whenever Ithaqua is the chosen Elder One, a blizzard token is placed on the board, forcing any investigator who enters it to fully max out stress and be unable to heal it. Worst yet, every time Ithaqua advances, the blizzard moves toward the investigators, summoning a Shantak from amidst the storm. From there on, things only get rougher for the investigators. As Ithaqua edges near our realm, the blizzard grows more intense, moving more frequently around the board, causing more stress, damage, and preventing movement. Of course, as the Lord of the Winds, all of his cultists are completely immune to the freezing weather, and roam free to attack the investigators. Ithaqua brings with him his devastating weather effects to the board, offering a whole-new experience in fighting the Old Ones.<br/><br/>Shantaks are enormous avian monsters with horse-like heads that attend the Old Ones. These creatures are incredibly tough, and their resilience makes it hard for investigators to eliminate them quickly. With their long affiliation with Ithaqua, Shantaks have learned ways to utilize the Great One's violent blizzards to enter our realm, and worse yet, as long as they're near a blizzard, they are at their more frightening form, forcing investigators to take stress before they attack or are attacked. Thus, Shantaks are constantly ticking down the investigators' stress, hampering their ability to manipulate dice rolls. The faster you get rid of these monsters, the better - which would be a lot easier if not for their aforementioned resilience...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The board has two folds, with the field in the center section and the list of plays and results, and dials for downs, quarters and yards to go on both side panels, one facing each end of the field.<br/><br/>Kickoff, return, reverse, lateral, line buck, off tackle, end run, pass, punt and spinner plays are resolved with two dice which are read lowest digit first, for 21 possible outcomes. Results of punts, field goals, try for point, free kick after safety, fumbles, blocked kicks and interference penalties are determined by a single die.<br/><br/>There is no defensive play choice. Instead, the defensive player is responsible for looking up the results and keeping tabs of yardage and downs while the offensive player considers his next play. The offensive player must choose his next play within 10 seconds or is hit with a five-yard delay of game penalty.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of Leipzig, fought in 1813, is one of the largest conflicts ever and involved many countries / kingdoms fighting against each other. This included a coalition of Russia, Prussia and Austria committed to defeat France and its allies, forging a domination of Europe that would lead to the Nationalism of Germany. While historians have drawn a myriad of contrary opinions about who were the good guys and bad guys, the battle encircles the city of Leipzig with 500,000 man armies facing each other.<br/><br/>The sheer size of this conflict can truly test a designer&rsquo;s skill when representing it at a battalion level. However, Leipzig is actually a series of smaller battles fought west, east, south and north of Leipzig as the Coalition armies concentrically move toward the City. La Bataille de Lindenau 1813 is the battle southwest of Leipzig.<br/><br/>La Bataille de Lindenau recreates the furious battle between the Hungarian Ignaz Gyulai,and his  IIIrd Austrian Corps, and their attempt to wrest the crucial town of Lindenau from General Bertrand's multinational IV Corps, as it defended the French lines of communication on October 16, 1813 just outside Leipzig.  The battle places Bertrand on the horns of a dilemma. On the one hand, Lindenau must stay in French hands if Napoleon has any hope of defeating the Coalition.  However, Bertrand also has an imperative to send as much of his able corps as possible to assist Napoleon on the Leipzig southern front. Gyulai's task is to disrupt both French goals.<br/><br/>The player will note immediately the differences in the different formations and how each must be managed to achieve success.<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game but will also accommodate two players on a side also.<br/><br/>The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate / expedite the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.<br/><br/>The special rules also feature an essay on Count Bertrand, Napoleon's close confident who is buried next to the Emperor at Les Invalides in Paris, and who was so crucial to the French efforts in the 1813 campaign.  The French must also wrestle with using German &quot;allies&quot;,  who have become unreliable at this stage of the campaign, and figure out how to keep Germans engaged in a favorable way to enhance French strategic efforts.<br/><br/>",

It includes the historical Japanese Indian Ocean Raid, but also examines other hypothetical options, in the period from April to November 1942. One player commands the Allied (largely Commonwealth) forces and the other the Japanese. Victory is obtained by destroying the opposing fleets, bombarding ports or airfields, interfering with merchant shipping, and possibly even supporting amphibious invasions or decoy operations.<br/><br/>Based on the system of the prize-winning  Solomon Sea, Bay of Bengal is a double blind 2-player game, which means each player moves his task forces, air strikes, and search planes on his own map, and tells the other player about the hexes he searches. Combat is resolved by a series of dice rolls. Each hex represents a diameter of 100 nautical miles, with 3 hours per turn. Each counter represents 6 to 10 planes, individual carries, or groups of smaller ships. Historical chrome includes rules such as radar equipped planes for night search and strikes, rescuing of survivors, leaking battleship boilers, armoured flight decks, and the secret British naval base. Eight historical and alternate-history scenarios are included.<br/><br/>",

They are the energy vortices on the etheric body which envelops the physical body. When understood, mastered and balanced, chakras invoke certain abilities that allow us to become adept in the respective fields. This game deals with 6 chakras and their associated properties. The knowledge of these properties is a step towards obtaining the key to different realms.<br/><br/>Objective:<br/>Aim of the game is to collect and make sets of cards associated with properties of chakras, thus symbolically attaining the knowledge with properties of all chakras to become CONSCIOUS of oneself!<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Chakra property cards are dealt to players who then attempt to make sets of cards. Basic and advanced versions define the nature of these sets. The game is played across multiple rounds, where each round focuses on claiming one chakra and use the associated ability (unique for each Chakra) in the subsequent round. The player to claim all the Chakras wins the game. Variants have also been suggested to alter gameplay length and/or complexity.<br/><br/>The subject of the game is suitable for all ages, making this a family-friendly game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Depending on the chosen game mode &quot;Conqueror or Attack&quot; the game will end sooner or later. Fight to conquer the world and show that you are the one who knows the most! Answer questions, think carefully about the territories you want to conquer and learn while you prove that you are the best in World Challenge Game.<br/> Choose one of two game modes:<br/><br/>- Conqueror, where you conquer as many countries as possible before the end of the game or Raid, where you attack and win the countries conquered by other players to take over the entire continent. In this mode you can conquer a country that another player has won.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player will take a card and choose one of the two existing questions, which they must read aloud, along with the four answers. The other participants will write on their card the answer which they consider correct, marking an &quot;X&quot; in the options A, B, C or D. When everyone has answered the question, the answers will be revealed, starting with the player to the left of the one who read the question. If the answer is correct, the player can place a conquest token in an available border country and the same for the rest of the players.<br/><br/>The Conqueror game will automatically end once the last country on the continent is conquered. At that time, the countries that each player has conquered will be counted, so the player with the most countries conquered will be the winner of the game. If there are two or more players who have the same maximum number of conquered countries, questions will be read to them as a tiebreaker. Players who cannot answer the question lose.<br/><br/>- The Attack game will end when there is only one player left on the continent and they will be crowned the winner. If the question cards run out, the game would end and the one with the most countries would win. There is also the option in case you want to continue the game, you can use the questions available in the APP, choosing the &quot;Board game questions&quot; section.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The rules of the game have been written by one of the industry&rsquo;s lead game designers, Alessio Cavatore and his studio Riverhorse. The rules are quick and easy to learn for a new player but are still able to offer a new and complex strategy to master. Conquest does away with player turns and army deployment. Instead, it focuses its play around the command stack mechanic, where each player determines at the beginning of the round what order his troops are going to be activated in. Coupled with a unique escalation reinforcement mechanic where light, medium and heavy troops each have their roles, the fog of war is a very real thing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The players themselves are the customers for these companies, and with more customers for a customer service, the more capital the company can purchase and the higher their share value. If you own the most shares in a company, you are its chair and decide if dividends are paid out to the shareholders or instead the funds are reinvested into company capital allowing them to have cheaper services. Players buy shares in companies that are likely to rise in value and sell them when their cash could be better used elsewhere. Because shares are so easily bought and dumped, and they retain value after an Aqua crash, holding shares is generally superior to holding Aqua.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players take turns playing combinations of cards from their hands in sums of 9. (See example images). The goal is to play all the cards in your hands before your opponents, so using a higher combination of cards per turn is recommended. <br/>As soon as a player manages to play all their cards, they win that round and are awarded with a Victory Card.<br/><br/>Victory Cards allow players to manipulate the game by adding their own personality and creativity to gameplay. Players build their own unique strategy, create/change rules, and destroy any opposing strategy when they're used the right way.<br/><br/>The first player to successfully play 9 of these Victory Cards wins the game!<br/><br/>Krypto-nine features ambidextrous playing cards for both-handed players, basic math skills to help the younger players have fun learning, and offers a wide range of playability to ensure it&rsquo;s a great time for all fun-seeking individuals!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Congress of Vienna (CoV) is a diplomatic Strategy CDG for one to four players. It is based on Churchill, the superb, award-winning Mark Herman design, and was well received during GMT&rsquo;s Spring 2019 Weekend at the Warehouse and June&rsquo;s CSW Expo in Tempe, Arizona. It is the third game after Churchill and Pericles in GMT&rsquo;s &ldquo;Great Statesmen&rdquo; series.<br/><br/>CoV creates an enthralling gaming arena. It allows players to become the main characters of the dramatic, titanic struggle between the struggling Napoleonic Empire and the coalition of Russia, Austria, and Great Britain (with their Prussian, Spanish, Portuguese, and Swedish allies).<br/><br/>The game starts after Napoleon&rsquo;s disastrous 1812 retreat from Moscow, covering the decisive years of 1813 and 1814. The abstract game map involves a strategic theatre portraying Europe from the Iberian Peninsula to the boundaries of Poland and Prussia. It also includes the secondary front of Italy, an area for depicting maritime warfare and the British/American War of 1812. This game by designer Frank Esparrago and developer Dick Sauer (with much appreciated input from Mark Herman) has been created to be played as both a diplomatic and strategic military conflict without losing the taste of the Napoleonic era&rsquo;s great battles.<br/><br/>All tables necessary for gameplay are printed on the game board. Congress of Vienna reproduces the spirit of Churchill in the mechanics and organization of its rules, diplomatic display, and its military map.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The board is sized like a standard board, but in addition to the center hole it has a hole in the center of each 10-point area.<br/><br/>Play is similar to standard Crokinole, except that any disk pocketed in one of the 10-point area holes is removed from play and counts -10 points. This allows for both offensive attack and makes tricky shots more risky. As a result, scoring is usually more chaotic and variable.<br/><br/>This game can be bought in five-hole form, or often a standard board can be retrofitted to make this version. That retrofit is almost always one-way, though!<br/><br/>",

Each team is represented by a series of tables representing rush and pass defense, special teams, all facets of the offense, and some miscellaneous tables.  Results are obtained by having the offense pick a player and a play (pass or run).  The offense rolls a die or dice for a result.  The defense then rolls on the appropriate table to modify the result.  Optional rules add defensive play calling to the game.  Seasons are known to exist from 1975 through 1981.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player tries to erode their mountain and generate the most amount of sediment in their delta. Players erode their mountains with the processes they successfully bid on and acquire. The sediment supplied to the delta becomes the coinage used in the bidding process. Mountains uplift 1,500 meters per turn until one player reaches 8,000 meters, or until the &quot;Active Uplift Shutdown&quot; event card is drawn. Then, it's a race to see who can erode their mountain away the fastest. When a player successfully erodes their mountain, the game ends. The winner is the player with the most sediment in their delta, after subtracting any sediment that remains in their mountain.<br/><br/>To the play the game, you need to print out a copy of the rules, the bidding row, the game cards (the card types include event, process, mountain front, and mountain type), and enough game boards for the number of players that will play. A cool rock and a cup to hold the sediment is also needed. You will also need to buy a couple boxes of Jujubees (you can eat them while you play), as they are the &quot;sediment&quot; used in the game.<br/><br/>The designer recommended printing the game materials (except the rules) in color, on 11&quot; x 17&quot; cardstock. To make the game, the designer recommended using a paper cutter, a glue stick, scissors (for minor clean up), and scotch tape.<br/><br/>The &quot;Erosion&quot; v. 1.0 ZIP file was available for download as of May 9, 2008 at the designer's former webpage<br/><br/>The files have been unavailable since Sierra Madre Games announced that they were publishing a revised version of Erosion in 2009.<br/><br/>",

Players make wild headlines that can even include custom cards with the players name and his friends on them. Never have tabloid lies been so much fun!!  In this game you can make the headlines, literally.<br/>     To play the game, players lay down cards in order of color code from their hand to form a 5 card headline. The player to complete the headline gets all 5 cards and the points they are worth. Each card has it's own point value.  When the first person runs out of cards, or the draw deck is empty, the game is over.  The player with the most points wins.  Quick &amp; easy.<br/>     The game generally takes less than 10 minutes but provides hours of fun.  The first edition (called the Morning Edition) is out now.  A second edition is expected by fall (the Evening Edition).<br/><br/>(From the publishers release information.)<br/><br/>",

Impersonate those pioneers in their conquest of the crowds by inventing and popularizing new match types!<br/><br/>A race for innovation takes place: inventing new match types rewards you with Glory Masks, but popularizing an already invented match can also make you steal it from your opponent. When a player popularizes 2 different match styles, the game ends.<br/><br/>On a given turn, a player will first get the chance to hire the best available Luchadores from the Lucha Gym to join their Promotion. Then, players are invited to choose between actions to build their Promotion or to challenge rival promotions by proposing a match. When choosing to build, a player can hire managers, invent new match styles, create Championship titles or use their Luchadores's family influence to collect member of the same family/clan.<br/><br/>When proposing a match, rivals have to match the style of your match-chosen luchadores in order to answer your challenge. If a successful Luchadores matching is made, players will go head to head in a dice rolling battle to earn the 3 count!<br/><br/>The Promotion having the most Glory Masks at the end of the game is declared the winner! Bonuses are given to the first player having completed the race, for each family/clan re-united and for each Championship Belt won in the matches. In that regard, the game proposes multiple strategies and paths to victory. With the memorization aspect of the families and wrestlers style, as well as the quick game turns, there is no downtime and plenty of room for strategy.<br/><br/>",

Each round you may pick up a maximum of 4 cards, in the order you wish to play them, you then move your driver's car according to the cards directions, around the track. But be careful, picking all 4 cards every time could result in collisions with other drivers, going off the track, or running out of fuel.<br/><br/>Before a race begins, you must choose your fuel load and tyre types according to different variables, such as weather conditions, where warmer temperatures result in quicker tyre wear, and also your fuel strategy, as you must choose your race fuel for qualifying. To make these decisions, you look at the various statistics on your driver's information cards, and place markers upon the starting fuel load, and reliablity statistics, which change over the course of the race.<br/><br/>",

Many of those who play miniatures began with this book and almost all existing rules systems can trace their lineage back to this book.<br/><br/>The book is a detailed building up of rules for playing a war game.  It contains detailed discussion of the rationale behind these rules, grounding them in military theory and history.  The book contains two sets of rules:  an elementary set for playing simple games and an advanced set of rules to provide a richer simulation.  It also contains one scenario, a mythical 18th century battle, which is played out step by step in the book.<br/><br/>These rules define the &quot;Old School&quot; of war gaming: individually based figures in large units with written orders to sub-commanders, etc.  Despite its age, there are groups of gamers who continue to base their encounters on the spirit of this book if not its strict letter.<br/><br/>",

It stands out with its strong focus on Turkish cultural nuances and humor, making it particularly enjoyable and relatable for those familiar with Turkish traditions and jokes.<br/><br/>The game boasts an extensive collection of 250 cards, each card being a gateway to laughter and fun. These cards are divided into 7 distinct categories, encompassing a wide range of words that resonate with various aspects of Turkish life and culture.<br/><br/>In the first round, players try to describe these personalities or concepts without mentioning their names, weaving in culturally specific references and humor. The second round challenges players to convey the same with just a single word. Finally, in the most exhilarating round, verbal communication is completely off-limits, and players must resort to gestures and charades, often drawing upon shared cultural experiences and jokes unique to the Turkish audience. This structure makes Makara not just a game of guessing but a celebration of Turkish culture and wit.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players must capture the most points worth of pieces from their opponents.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player may either move a piece exactly the number shown on the top at the piece, or they may rotate a piece to increase or decrease the top number by 1. The number at the top is the piece's movement value, indicating how many spaces it must move (should you choose to move it), but it is also the points value of the piece, awarded to the opposing player if they capture it. Captures are made by finishing a move on top of another player's piece. During a move, a piece may not move over another piece, or backtrack through a space it just went through.<br/>  <br/>In a 2-player game, the game ends when one player has lost all of their pieces, or when both players have only a single piece left on the board.  <br/>In a 3+ player game, the game ends when one player has captured 6 opposing pieces.<br/><br/>Once the game ends, players add up their captured points. Since the winner is the player with the most captured points, and not the player who has captured the most pieces, it is possible to lose all of your pieces and still win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Odkrywcy kultur is a game of cultural discovery that takes you around the world in just 40 minutes!<br/><br/>We all love to travel, explore exotic civilizations, and gain a greater understanding of the cultural heritage of others. But discovery isn&rsquo;t always easy, and there&rsquo;s always that chance that missteps might offend rather than open doors.<br/><br/>Did your host in Japan reach for her samurai sword when you plunged your chopsticks into the rice bowl? Did the guys in an English pub take a swing at you after you gestured to the bartender asking for two beers?<br/><br/>Odkrywcy kultur takes players to new and exciting places around the world while showing them how to behave to avoid confusion, conflicting signals, and even real danger. During the game, participants visit all continents and discover hundreds of unwritten rules of social behavior: how to gesture acceptance in India, what to avoid in Egypt during Ramadan, and how to successfully conduct business negotiations in Brazil.<br/><br/>Odkrywcy kultur is a unique mix of a modern board game and a handbook on cross-cultural communications. As players race to pick up souvenirs across the globe, they must think tactically to plan their trip, quiz others on potential cultural faux pas, and quickly react to opponents&rsquo; moves. As with any game, a bit of luck always helps.<br/><br/>When players correctly answer an opponent&rsquo;s question they win chips with souvenirs and can then travel to another country, opening a treasure chest of knowledge about the new region. The game&rsquo;s questions were designed and arranged to offer interesting and practical information about our &ldquo;global village&rdquo; during play.<br/><br/>The rules of Odkrywcy kultur were designed by Karol Madaj, designer of 303 as well as Kolejka (Queue) and Lukasz M. Pogoda. The questions and answers in Odkrywcy kultur were drawn from the decades of travel experience and cultural exploration of Halina Grzymala-Moszczynska, PhD, professor of Jagiellonian University in Cracow, and Witold Sekudewicz, the game&rsquo;s author and managing director of The Link School of Foreign Languages and Intercultural Communications. Mr. Sekudewicz and Ms. Grzymala-Moszczynska worked closely with a panel of widely traveled experts from universities on five continents in creating the game.<br/><br/>Odkrywcy kultur is a must for anyone with an interest in our multicultural world and a love of sharing fun and excitement with friends and family. It&rsquo;s a great pastime for both seasoned explorers and those who only dream about faraway places. Also, it is a storehouse of practical knowledge for any business traveler: Don&rsquo;t risk a blunder and failed deals because you misread the signals when you&rsquo;re away from home.<br/><br/>Before you buy your plane, train, or boat tickets, learn how to sidestep unpleasant situations and awkward apologies and avoid offending your hosts. Yes, even a journey of 10,000 miles begins with a single step. Odkrywcy kultur is the step you&rsquo;ll want to take first.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The final phase of the French Revolutionary War saw the rise of the greatest commander of the era. Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte was a military and political genius, who used his growing popularity to make himself ruler of France. After an assassination attempt, he made himself emperor, hoping to be accepted by other monarchs. He was not, and the mutual distrust and antipathy led both sides to choose war over peace. The conflict spanned all of Europe, from the mountains of Portugal to the gates of Moscow. The struggle spilled into the wider world, in time dragging America into the conflict as she waged a separate and futile war with the British.<br/><br/>Constant warfare and decades of military theory led to a major shift in warfare. The pace of operations, and the depredations of war, increased to a frenzy not seen in Europe since the Roman Empire. Battles were big, decisive, and bloody. Infantry became more mobile and proficient, with mixed formations and tactics being used. The French in particular pioneered a combined arms approach to warfare where infantry, cavalry, and artillery were used in concert. Even after the wars ended the desire for fast decisive action would dictate western military policy until World War II.<br/><br/>The battles included are...<br/><br/>Rivoli - January 14, 1797 &ndash; Bonaparte's First Masterpiece<br/><br/>The Pyramids - July 21, 1798 &ndash; &ldquo;Forty centuries look down upon you.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Novi - August 15, 1799 &ndash; &ldquo;Now it&rsquo;s time for action!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Hohenlinden - December 3, 1800 &ndash; The Zenith of Jean Moreau<br/><br/>Austerlitz - December 2, 1805 &ndash; &ldquo;We are babies in the hands of a giant.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Cape Town - January 8, 1806 &ndash; &ldquo;The bitter cup must be drunk to the bottom.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Auerstadt - October 14, 1806 &ndash; &ldquo;Tell your Marshal he is seeing double.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Friedland - June 14, 1807 &ndash; &ldquo;Then we have already made peace.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Bail&eacute;n - July 19, 1808 &ndash; &ldquo;The whole nation is exasperated and determined to fight.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Wagram - July 5-6, 1809 &ndash; Archduke Charles&rsquo; Last Battle<br/><br/>Bussaco - September 27, 1810 &ndash; &ldquo;I have never witnessed a more gallant charge.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Albuera - May 16, 1811 &ndash; &ldquo;Die hard 57th, die hard!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Queenston Heights - October 13, 1812 &ndash; Disaster at Niagara<br/><br/>Maloyaroslavets - October 24, 1812 &ndash; &ldquo;Here began the flight and destruction of the enemy.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Dresden - August 26-27, 1813 &ndash; &ldquo;God has uttered His judgement. He was of your opnion.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Thames - October 5, 1813 &ndash; &ldquo;Remember the Raisin!&rdquo;<br/><br/>La Rothi&egrave;re - February 1, 1814 &ndash; &ldquo;What will they say in Paris after this victory?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Lundy&rsquo;s Lane - July 25, 1814 &ndash; Butchery at Dusk<br/><br/>New Orleans - January 8, 1815 &ndash; The Eighth<br/><br/>La Souffel - June 28, 1815 &ndash; &ldquo;Let the brave swear never to quit their eagles.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;description of the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Many Figures in Westeros do not Work for one Faction Alone<br/><br/>Westeros is a land not unfamiliar with war and conflict. Much blood has been shed all across its expanse. During times of strife, there are those that don&rsquo;t simply stand behind a single banner, but will move from force to force looking to either make some coin or simply follow their own paths and desires. These individuals are no less useful on the battlefield, as they often bring special skills that may not be found under one&rsquo;s own banner.<br/><br/>The Neutral Heroes II Box has many of these individuals, from all walks of life and from all corners of Westeros. There are new Unit Attachments such as Bronn or Brienne. There&rsquo;s new Non-Combat Units like Jaqen H&rsquo;ghar and Tycho Nestoris. There are even new Neutral army commanders like Vargo Hoat and Daario Naharis, complete with their Tactics Cards. Each one can dramatically alter the way an army functions on the battlefield.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fifth installment in Rick Young&rsquo;s Fast Action Battle Series. <br/>FAB turns East.<br/><br/>The time is set for Operation Barbarossa and the greatest tank battle of all times: more than 3.000 Soviet and nearly 700 German tanks and assault guns will clash in Soviet occupied Southern Poland. Known as the Battle of Brody-Dubno-Lutsk, that bloody triangle saw the direst straits of invading German forces in Barbarossa as they struggle for a week to repel the massive Soviet armored counterattacks to the flanks of the spearhead formed by Ewald Kleist's 1st Panzergruppe.<br/><br/>German invasion force was aimed towards Kyiv and the Kyiv Special Military District was the better armed and prepared of all Soviet Fronts stationed on the Westerns borders of the URSS, with a full array of Soviet Mechanized Corps, equipped with hundreds of the new brand tanks KV and T-34.<br/>As the German player you control two powerful German armies: 6th and 1st Panzergruppe. The Soviet player will control the Northern flank of the Southwestern Front &ndash;formed by the 5th and 6th all arms armies. Blocks are mostly divisions with some regiments/brigades and German Kampfgruppen.<br/><br/>In DUBNO&rsquo;41 you will see, with a minimum of new rules, the Soviet unpreparedness for war in June 1941 as they desperately struggled for defeating the German invaders. Soviets had a huge amount of low quality units with powerful but fragile armored forces against the Wehrmacht at its peak of quality and efficiency. Not a one-sided battle as someone could think about Operation Barbarossa but the Soviets could accomplish their mission and defeat or at least stop the invaders. The game includes assets for minor but powerful German units as the elite 652nd Panzerjaeger battalion or the scarce panzer grenadiers units fully equipped with armored carrier vehicles, heavy artillery, anti-tank units, the all-known 88&rsquo;s cannons and more. Events include Soviet extra-hard KV and T-34 tanks, flamethrower tanks, air attacks, Soviet mechanical breakdowns and political officers and more&hellip;<br/><br/>German swiftness and tactical ability is opposed to Soviet mass and technological advantage. Weirdly not a single Stuka plane would arrive to help the German forces as Army Group South was not equipped with that type of aircraft. Soviet Air Force will fight one of its more desperate battles adding considerable strength to Soviet ground attacks. Will you pierce the Soviet lines and breakout towards Kyiv, or you would slow the German advance and counterattack successfully defeating the invaders?<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Finally, set a device with a timer at the entrance of the corridor.<br/><br/>You have 60 seconds. Whenever you are ready, hit the timer and start running! Use your fingers to &quot;walk&quot; through the corridor, avoid touching the lasers and try to get to the gallery. Each painting grants you 2 points and each relic grants you 1 point.  You must steal one painting before taking the relics!

        "description": "Stress Botics Odyssey expands the heavy eurogame experience in 5 axes, while maintaining the basic rules and rhythm of the base game.<br/><br/>The first enhanced axis is the main room (the room where Alpha Bot currently is). Odyssey&rsquo;s alternate board contains a zoom of the main room, and thus players will have to take into account their positioning, in order to fight against the cylindroids and defend Alpha Bot from them. If Alpha Bot does not reach the surface, deliveries to ships will be much more complex to execute!<br/><br/>The second enhanced axis are the Cylindroids. When the players eliminate an entire wave of enemies, a Cylindroid Elite will appear. This powerful enemy is Alpha Bot&rsquo;s nemesis, and boasts its own AI and complex behaviour.<br/><br/>The third enhanced axis is Alpha Bot. Beta Bots will be able to access the interior of Alpha Bot through a new type of action. Once inside they will be able to control Alpha Bot's AI in order to speed up its behavior, change its direction to crush enemies or avoid obstacles, repair shields, collect resources or equip objects, among many other things. However, players will have to be cautious when interacting with AlphaBot... If it receives damage while being controlled, it will activate its other temperamental AI revealing one of its multiple aggressive behaviors, such as going back to an already explored main room or indiscriminately attacking any robot next to it!<br/><br/>The fourth enhanced axis is the Solo Mode. By adding Delta Bot, a small robot that will accompany us to fulfill our objectives, adventurous players can play the game on their own. Odyssey includes an additional board to be affixed to the player's blueprint in order to expand management during the maintenance phases, as well taking care of Delta Bot. If the little companion accumulates too much stress it will explode, making the game much harder for the solo player.<br/><br/>The fifth enhanced axis is additional content. Odyssey adds more items to the current sets, including a new type of item: the boxed items.

You want to impress everyone but your parents are visiting for Christmas and you only have nine weeks to get ready.<br/><br/>Each turn is three days: Friday, Saturday and Sunday (the only days that matter!). Fridays are payday. You get paid, and life happens. Saturdays and Sundays are up to you. On each day you can: (a) Shop for furniture (b) Assemble furniture or (c) Throw a party<br/><br/>The game features a number of furniture stores (decks of cards) which you can choose to visit and browse but with limited stock it&rsquo;s important to visit the right store to get the items you need. Remembering what you see in a given store is half the battle.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most Life Points at the end of Christmas. You can score two types of life points: Parent Points and Party Points. Most Parent Points are scored at the end of the game when your parents visit. Your parents are impressed by matching furniture and grown up d&eacute;cor. Party Points are scored throughout the game. You can choose to throw a party, but sometimes the fun happens when you least expect.<br/><br/>",

The rules for movement and interaction are simple and easy to learn, so you can enjoy your visit to our mini golf course in no time.<br/><br/>The course consists of 6 holes of different shapes, filled with hexes. The aim of the game is to putt your ball from the tee within the starting zone into the hole on the other side. The balls move across the hexes in straight lines, according to the value on the die. The score represents the number of strokes needed to put the ball in the hole. After completing the course, the scores on the individual holes are summed up and the player with the lowest score is the winner. The players may agree to play the whole course, to play just on a few selected holes, or any other way they wish.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The new Advanced Game takes this 70s design into the 21st Century with modifications allowed by the terrific research of groups like STATS, Retrosheet, Baseball Prospectus, and sabermetricians from around the country. The main improvements come from the addition of LH and RH pitching and batting splits, a totally revamped and more accurate pitching formula, revised and expanded ratings for stealing, base-running, defense, clutch hitting, and ballpark effects. If you liked the original you&rsquo;ll love the Advanced version, if you never played the original, you&rsquo;ll discover a very accurate game that is quick and easy to play.<br/><br/>",

Become an actual player and see the outcome of your hits on TV as you watch the video tape containing footage of professional slugging action.  Home runs, double plays, triples, fielding errors, pop-ups...it's all there for you to see and experience!<br/><br/>The basic game is quickly learned and fast playing.  Each time you pitch or bat you choose a baseball strategy.  Make your decision just as in real baseball -- depending on what kind of hit you want to get, how many outs there are, and if there are runners on the base.  Then compare your choice with your opponent's and find out what happens.  You could strike out, get a walk, or a hit.  If it's a hit -- you watch the videotape to see the outcome!<br/><br/>And VCR Baseball is actually two strategy games in one.  The advanced game adds more baseball depth.  Your team players have their own batting and pitching abilities, so you can bring in a right-handed pinch hitter to try for a crucial hit off a lefty pitcher.  Or relieve a tiring pitcher.  Intentionally walk an excellent hitter, bunt or steal a base.<br/><br/>Features:<br/>- 2 games in one!<br/>- unlimited replayability<br/>- for 2 players<br/>- live footage of professional ball players in action<br/>- fun for ages 12 to adult<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- approx. 30-minute video tape<br/>- colorful game board<br/>- 6 playing pieces<br/>- batting and pitching cards<br/>- playing grids<br/>- score pad<br/>- player cards<br/>- 3 dice<br/><br/>",

A two-player baseball simulation strategy game, it was published in 1964 and 1965 by Hassenfeld Brothers (now Hasbro), in conjunction with its creator, Roger Franklin. CTY uses the lifetime statistics of players, as of the prior season. 250,000 copies were sold.<br/><br/>One player manages the Yankees' 25-man roster, while the other manages a team of 25 MLB All-Stars. Players can also manage a team of their own creation, using blank player cards.<br/><br/>Each player is represented by a Player Performance strategy card, which contains his photograph, autograph, lifetime batting average (as of the prior year's season), and some basic biographical information. Each card also contains twelve outcomes that detail the result of the roll of two dice. Ex: if Mickey Mantle is at bat and the Yankees manager roles a 3, Mantle hits a home run. If a player hits a single, double, triple, ground ball, or fly ball, the fielding team's manager draws a corresponding Fielders Action card. Ex: Mantle hits a single; the Fielder Actions card says the batter is safe at first, runner on first advances 1 base, all other runners score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A wild Hold'em variation played with a richly illustrated deck of comic cards containing humorous images of the personalities and issues that contested the 2004 presidential election.<br/><br/>Each card contains a unique &quot;Swing Vote&quot; that introduces a new rule to the current poker hand and cleverly relates to the funny illustration, nickname, and political caption on the card.  The card names and humor will remind game geeks and political wonks of cards and news events from their favorite boardgames and presidential campaigns.   The &quot;Hanging Chad&quot; card, for example, allows the second best hand to win the pot, the &quot;Patriot Act&quot; forces every player to reveal one of their hidden cards, the &quot;National Insecurity Adviser&quot; randomly redistributes the hole cards, and the &quot;FCC&quot; card penalizes the next player to curse.  Each suit represents a different political point of view and poker term: the Hearts are the Pro-Kerry Boston Studs, the Diamonds the pro-Bush Texas Hold&rsquo;ems, the Clubs the Anti-Kerry Flip Floppers, and the Spades are the Anti-Bush Dummy Hands.<br/><br/>Can used to play any standard playing card game and is intended to provide as much value for the comedic commentary and art as the game play.  Fantastic contemporary illustrations produced by hip-hop artist Cojo and veteran political cartoonist R.J. Matson.<br/><br/>Presidential Poker 2012 will be published mid-year 2012 with entirely new personality and issue cards and a more strategic rule set.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a new board-game created and designed by two Hungarian friends of tactical games :)<br/><br/>About the HEX-TRI Game:<br/><br/>- This is a strategic, multiplayer board game, based on logic.<br/>- 2 to 6 players may play the game together.<br/>- Anyone can learn the rules, and get familiar with the dynamics of the game within a few minutes of play.<br/>- New tactics are learned best while playing the game.<br/>- Because of the virtually infinity number of possible game situations, it takes a long-long time to become prepared to handle those sneaky tricks in game.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to take out the Main Figure of the enemy. If a player&rsquo;s Main Figure is removed from the board, all of his/her figures are removed from this game.<br/><br/>Gaming concept:<br/>The game play is based on rounds taking place after each other. A round is divided into 3 phases. In the 1st phase of all round, the players makes their movements with the figures, using the points available to them on the fields. After this the game proceeds to the 2nd phase, in which some of the hex-fields produces points available to be used in the next round. In the 3rd phase the battles takes place on fields occupied by more players. As a result of battle the field becomes the territory of the player with more figures standing on it, or in case of a draw, the field&rsquo;s ownership stays unclear causing this field not to produce points in the next round.<br/><br/>After all have been done, a new round begins, and the game goes on like this round by round.<br/><br/>More information can be found here:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.hextri.hu\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.hextri.hu</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game of Rebellion was first produced by A. Williams and Company, Boston, Massachusetts (US) in 1861 with subsequent editions being produced by Heyer Brothers through the early 20th century. It was copyrighted by its inventor Henry A. Sampson.<br/><br/>The subject matter of the game is the American Civil War.<br/><br/>The game is for two or more players. There are 50 cards (5.8cm long x 9cm wide), and 7 &quot;counters (1.7cm)&quot;. The cards are divided into 3 &quot;suits&quot; - red, blue, black - which have significance in the play of the game. On each card, the name of a prominent political or military personage of the time appears, or the name of a city which was the scene of a battle. The cards, counters, and instructions are encased in a box 11cm long x 7.6cm wide x 1.7cm high .<br/><br/>The Game Cards are divided evenly between &ldquo;Union&rdquo; and &ldquo;Confederate&rdquo; sides. The &ldquo;Union&rdquo; cards are printed in red ink and include a card marked &ldquo;Washington&rdquo; representing the Union Capitol along with 24 cards each with the name of a Union General, Officer, Politician or Ship. Included is a card for Abraham Lincoln, Colonel Ellsworth, the frigate Lawrence, Winfield Scott, General Sherman, General Butler and many other Union Officers. The &ldquo;Confederate&rdquo; cards are printed in black ink and include a card marked &ldquo;Richmond&rdquo; representing the Confederate Capitol along with 24 cards each with the name of a Confederate General, Officer, Politician or Ship. Included is a card for Jefferson Davis, Privateer Petrel, General Lee, General Johnson, General Beauregard and many other Confederate Officers.<br/><br/>The Game was played between two people &ndash; one took all the Union cards and the other the Confederate cards. They players would lay down the card representing the capitol of their respective countries and the box, containing 24 blue and one red token would be placed far enough away from the players so that they could not see the tokens inside. Play would begin with one player laying down a card at the center of the table and the other player choosing a card to &ldquo;oppose&rdquo; that card. Then the players would each take turns drawing a token from the box &ndash; when a player drew the single red token from the box he would &ldquo;win&rdquo; that battle and take his opponent&rsquo;s card &ldquo;as prisoner&rdquo;. This play would continue until one of the players captured all of the original cards from the other thus being declared the &ldquo;Victor&rdquo;.<br/><br/>A Heyer Brothers edition game is part of the collection of the Games Museum in Waterloo, Canada.<br/><br/>",

But - armed as we are with this advice - we have put together A GAME where - to put it briefly - we make words out of letters and other words out of the words already made.

        "description": "BATH ENDEAVOUR is one of a series of Monopoly style board game developed by local YMCAs in the UK to generate funds for their activities.  The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case the City of Bath in the West of England.<br/><br/>Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6.  When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes.  If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.<br/><br/>Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same color series.  Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.<br/><br/>Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies.  This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own.  It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/>-    After a set time.<br/>-    When the first player becomes bankrupt.<br/>-    When all but one player has gone bankrupt.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate.  The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This appears to be a game of Zionist tourism or return to the Promised Land.  The box measures 19 1/8&quot; by 9 5/8&quot; by 1 3/4&quot;.  It is finished in a diagonal woven texture in tan with some blue-gray highlighting.  In the upper left corner of the lid is a glued-on label.  The label depicts an oasis with several palm trees, green grass, a pool of water, and several people, one seated on a camel.<br/><br/>The label reads: &quot;Game of OASIS (trade mark) The Romance of the Promised Land Copyright MCMXXXVII by Milton Bradley Co. Springfield Mass. Made in U.S.A.  In the lower left of the label is the number 4029.<br/><br/>The mounted board measures 18 1/2&quot; by 18 1/4&quot;.  The board features a light-blue background.  In the center is a round map of Palestine locating several cities, some settlements, and taking pains to point out a single &quot;Electric Works.&quot;<br/><br/>A large circle fills most of the board.  This circle is divided into three concentric rings with spaces, most of which are illustrated with detailed drawings of buildings, historic sites and other features of Palestine.<br/><br/>These spaces are divided into one yellow, one pink, and one green zone, divided by three equidistant &quot;spokes&quot; in blue.  One of these spokes depicts the Mediterranean coast with several steamers approaching Haifa and Tel Aviv (this spoke is labeled &quot;START&quot;).<br/><br/>A second spoke is labeled &quot;Yarkon River,&quot; and the third, &quot;Jordan River.&quot;  Each colored zone has three blank white spaces, one in each of the three rings.  The yellow and pink zones each have twelve colored spaces, while the green zone has fifteen.<br/><br/>Some examples of these zones (with drawings) include &quot;Jaffa Namal, Pay 5 sh Mehes;&quot; &quot;Hotel--300 sh;&quot;  &quot;Rachel's Tomb--Visit;&quot;  &quot;Keren Kayemeth--Land Free--100 sh Dev.;&quot; &quot;Factory Site--100 sh -- 300 sh Dev.;&quot; &quot;Hulleh Swamps -- Contribute;&quot; &quot;Bialik's Home--Contribute Writer's Fund 5 sh;&quot;  &quot;Herzl Forest--Plant Trees;&quot; &quot;Wailing Wall--Visit;&quot; &quot;Arab Land--40sh--100 sh Dev.;&quot; &quot;Hebrew University--Scholarship 50 sh;&quot; &quot;Hadassah Hospital--Contribute.&quot;  There are many more.<br/><br/>The game includes four wooden pawns in green, orange, red, and white.  The game also uses small dreidels, with green, orange, red, and white shafts, in place of dice.  A very large number of die-cut card &quot;shekels&quot; in denominations 1, 5, 10, 20, and 50 are included, along with a set of 32 very sturdy green cards with text on one side (blank on back).  These cards are as heavy as the old green &quot;flags&quot; that came with Tinkertoys fifty years ago.<br/><br/>Some examples of card texts: &quot;If you have paid your dues and are a member of the HISTADRUTH (Federation of Labor) you may go to the Hadassah Hospital and receive Medical Care free of charge.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This is the eve of Pesah (Passover).  Cleanse your home of Hometz (Leaven) and move 5 spaces forward.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;This is the 13th day of Adar which commemorates the Yahrzeit (the anniversary of the death) of Joseph Trumpeldor.  Go to Tel Hai and visit the grave of this great national hero who sacrificed his life defending Jewish settlements in Palestine.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Go to Petah Tikvah to supervise a cooperative Pardess (orange grove).  Collect 5 SH'KOLIM from each OLEH.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Go to Jerusalem to the Immigration Dept. to obtain certificates for Halutzim (Pioneers) who wish to settle in Palestine.&quot;<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this otherwise well-preserved game was found with no rules.  Attempts to find rules through the Milton Bradley rules site, and generally on the Internet, have proven unsuccessful.  As an artifact, the game provides a fascinating glimpse into the aspirations of a people in the final years before WW II.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overlord is a set of miniature wargame rules that cover tactical-level combat in Normandy from June to August, 1944. The rules are suitable for 1:300th to 28mm scale, though they work best for 15mm miniatures.<br/><br/>The ground scale for the game is 1&quot; equals 10 metres, 1 turn equals 2 1/2 minutes, 1 model soldier/vehicle equals 1 real soldier/vehicle.<br/><br/>The basic unit for the game is an infantry squad or individual gun and crew or single AFV. Infantry are mounted in multiples on bases that represent rifle groups, light machine gun groups, heavy machine gun groups, light mortar groups. etc. Leaders, who represent platoon leaders and senior NCOs, are mounted singly.<br/><br/>The sequence of play follows traditional lines: Initiative, Move, Fire, Close Assault, Morale. However, there is a Watch and Shoot phase, where units can elect to fire before the normal Fire phase or hold their fire to take opportunity fire against the opponent's moving units. Only units with Watch and Shoot orders can take opportunity fire.<br/><br/>Firing is done by individual stands; there is no mechanism for combining the fire of several stands, though the results of fire combat can have a cumulative effect. Fire combat uses a unique system where a firing stand's weapon type is first cross-referenced with one of six major columns that represent the cover state of the target unit(s), then cross-referenced with the result of a modified die roll. Results can create individual casualties for a stand or, in a separate die roll, the loss of the entire stand. Because casualties represent the loss of single soldiers, a stand may take several casualties before it is lost.<br/><br/>Before units can be targeted for fire, they must be spotted. The visibility of units can be affected by  activities such as moving, firing, etc. Units might be very difficult to spot, which represents the historical difficulty of seeing the enemy in the dense terrain of Normandy. In larger games, keeping track of which units are spotted may be cumbersome.<br/><br/>Morale is strictly based on the performance of historical units. There is a special category called Fanatic that is used solely by units of the 12th SS &quot;Hitlerjugend&quot; division. This represents the relative inexperience of the troops combined with the fanaticism instilled in them through their Hitler Youth indoctrination. Most Allied units are classed as Inexperienced, which represents the fact that, though well-trained, they are experiencing combat for the first time. Other Classifications are Elite (such as Airborne units and most of the SS), Veteran (most German units), and Poor (such as German Ostbattalion units).<br/><br/>The antitank rules are fairly simply, but they tend to provide predictable historical results. The rules don't really seem to emphasize tank combat. Rather, tanks are added in as a specialized heavy weapon, but the rules are not intended for large tank vs. tank actions.<br/><br/>The game play allows for hidden set up and limited hidden movement, which can give the defender (usually the Germans) the ability to mount a very tenacious defense while being strongly outnumbered.<br/><br/>Overlord can be used to play games that consist of only a few squads or up to a full battalion on each side. However, larger games can be slow.<br/><br/>Many of the mechanics for Overlord are similar to the mechanics used in the designer's other WW2 tactical rules, &quot;Grey Storm, Red Steel.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cheltenham Challenge is one of a series of Monopoly style board game developed by local YMCAs in the UK to generate funds for their activities. The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case the town of Cheltenham, famous for its horse racing in the Heart of England. 90 miles from London.<br/><br/>Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.<br/><br/>Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.<br/><br/>Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/>- After a set time.<br/>- When the first player becomes bankrupt.<br/>- When all but one player has gone bankrupt.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game combines roll-and-move, auctions, horse-trading and multiple victory conditions. Players roll to move around an intersecting track that includes a space for each state and spaces with instructions (Free TV, Major Fundraiser, Go to Home Region, Good News, Minor Set-Back, Minor Foul-Up, Major Disaster).<br/><br/>The states are divided into five regions, and ranked within each region. Players pick a region and roll for Home State on 2D6 within the region. When a player lands on an unclaimed state, it goes up for auction (with conditions). A player can grab another state in his home region for the minimum bid; if in another candidate&rsquo;s home region, it is a two-way auction with that candidate; otherwise all can participate. Landing on a controlled state requires paying money (more if the owner is there or it is part of a bloc of 7+ states in its region). Players can trade states and money at any time.<br/><br/>Players can win in one of four ways: Front Runner (majority of the 1500 total delegate votes); Regional Bloc (control 7+ states in each of 3 regions);  Key States (control 10+ of the 15 states ranked #1, #2 and #3 in their regions, including 2+ #1s); and Balanced National Appeal (control 5+ states from each of 4 regions).<br/><br/>After 1.5 hours, the game moves to a Convention round, where players not meeting minimum levels are eliminated, everyone gets bonus money and all auctions are open. After another 30 minutes, if no one has achieved one of the victory conditions, there is a Roll Call vote and most delegates wins.<br/><br/>",

This time the game takes place in the surroundings of Pietarsaari (or Jakobstad in Swedish) which is a small town on the coast of Gulf of Bothnia in Finland.<br/><br/>The game is very typical roll and move economy game. Two dices are thrown and doubles give another throw. Players should collect sets of stocks with the same color to make corresponding squares on the board more expensive. This time there are no buildings to be built, you just need to get the stocks. Trading of stocks may be done freely between players.<br/><br/>Yes, random event cards exist in this game too. Some cards take the player to treasure hunting, which means a lot of money. Some other cards may contain trivia question which can be very tricky - especially if Pietarsaari region is unknown. By answering a correctly to the question the player earns some money, and with a wrong answer the money must be paid.<br/><br/>Players decide together how much initial money is given and when does the game end. Therefore the game can be played as long - or short - as the players want to. The winner is the player whose fortune is the most valuable at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

It has 4 double sided boards and even innovative aspects like a service car (for each cycling team) and even road signs and a tunnel.<br/><br/>With all these elements and others that I do not display here (in the booklet there are examples of how to set up different stages), this game is deceptively simple (not to say silly). The rules can basically be summarized as:<br/><br/>- roll one die,<br/>- move your rider<br/>- follow the instructions on the board if any<br/>- if you fall on a question square, draw one question card and try to answer<br/>- when the stage is over, fill up a lot of boring classification sheets while you pretend you are enjoying yourself<br/>- play next stage<br/><br/>",

Students are leaders of major factions within the National Assembly (and in the streets outside) as it struggles to create a constitution amidst internal chaos and threats of foreign invasion.  Will the king retain power?  Will the priests of the Catholic Church obey the &ldquo;general will&rdquo; of the National Assembly or the dictates of the pope in Rome?  Do traditional institutions and values constitute restraints on freedom and individual dignity or are they its essential bulwarks?<br/><br/><br/>Are slaves, women, and Jews entitled to the &ldquo;rights of man&rdquo;?  Is violence a legitimate means of changing society or of purging it of dangerous enemies?  In wrestling with these issues, students consult Jean-Jacques Rousseau&rsquo;s Social Contract and Edmund Burke&rsquo;s Reflections on the Revolution in France, among other texts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "King Coal was produced by Westar Mining (a now-defunct Canadian company) as a promotional game, although it is unclear how many copies ended up being distributed, or to whom.<br/><br/>In the game, each player proceeds through a series of initial phases in order to get an operating coal mine - exploration to find coal deposits (either small or large), proving-up, capitalization (capitalizing a small mine brings less cash, but requires a smaller winning total as well), and construction.<br/><br/>After a player has finished construction, his or her mine begins production, which is the main part of the game. Each turn, the inflation rate is determined, each player decides whether to run their mine at full production, reduced production, or not at all, and pays the appropriate costs. There are costs for labor, ports, rail, power, and equipment.  After costs are paid, market price is determined and players collect revenue. There are card decks associated with production and marketing which may affect results (there are also cards for earlier phases).<br/><br/>Players can purchase various assets to produce better results or avoid bad events - they can buy production contracts, marketing contracts, pollution control systems, and insurance policies. Also available are assets associated with all costs except labor - a player purchasing one of these receives the appropriate costs each turn instead of the bank. These assets can be taken over by other players.<br/><br/>There is also a simplified version of the game which begins in the construction phase and eliminates some of the event cards and minor assets.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Rules <br/>Self-esteem is something everyone wants for their children. We assume that when children value themselves they will not only be happier, but will develop a strong sense of self. A strong identity will in turn be a resource for them to draw on as they meet the many challenges of growing up. Mental health professionals almost universally agree that lack of self-esteem can be a significant factor in a host of childhood disorder from depression to under-achievement to anti-social behavior.<br/><br/>The Dinosaur's Journey to High Self-Esteem reflects this multi-dimensional understanding of self-esteem. As children advance along the game board they draw cards which ask them to think about their values, friendships. ability to understand themselves and others, and their resources in meeting life's common problems. Each card presents a unique opportunity for a child to think and experience the building blocks of self-esteem.<br/><br/>",

Each player manoeuvres his fleet with the object of occupying naval bases of his opponent to the value of 100 points.  Whilst planning attack, defence, must not be neglected, and much strategy is required for manoeuvring to the best advantage.<br/><br/>Differences in strength and speed of the various units of the fleet and in the configuration of the coasts marked on the charts are such that innumerable situations arise, and the game is full of variety.<br/><br/>Each player has 1 battleship, 1 submarine, 3 cruisers, and 5 destroyers and they are PINNED (yep pinned) onto the board to show their location.  Bases are captured by ships entering them and they are marked by pins to show ownership.   Each ship has a movement value (for example destroyers rate a 3) and in a turn a player cannot move more than 10 points.  To resolve battles the teetotum is used.<br/><br/>It has 6 Bs (Battleship) 4 Cs (Cruiser) and 2 Ds (Destroyer).  Its is spun and if the letter matches the attacking ships its a hit (submarines always use the letter of the ship they are attacking so they have an equal chance against any ship).<br/><br/>Very interesting game and you get to push pins into a board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rex was published by &quot;Rex-Verlag Rudolf Schilling&quot; in Frankfurt am Main, Germany in 1900. It can be described as a mixture between Salta from 1899, since the pieces of each player have to cross the board to the other side, and Chess, for the pieces have different value and represent General, Horse, Soldier etc.<br/><br/>Unlike Chess, captured pieces are of a certain value (between 1 and 40!), and pieces all move in the same way (one step along the lines) crossing a grid of diagonally linked points in alternating dark and light rows. To start, pieces can jump from the &quot;encampment&quot; onto each of the points in the first row. Only pieces on dark points can be captured - obviously only by pieces on light points. After crossing the &quot;battlefield&quot;, they &quot;jump off&quot; into the opponent`s encampment, where they are safe.<br/>The game ends, if one player cannot do a legal move anymore. The player with less lost points wins the game. But aware: Not only captured pieces score negative, also the pieces still in your own half (now the opponents`) are considered &quot;captured&quot;.<br/><br/>There were different editions of the game, a more expensive one with 3-dimensional figures and a cheaper one with flat stones instead.<br/><br/>In 1902 there was a second edition with simpler rules.<br/><br/>",

Players represent the last remaining, human survivors struggling to endure while caught in the crossfire of warring alien factions.<br/><br/>Each player controls a character (miniature) with different attributes, skills, items and weapons (tracked by the use of cards). Game play takes place on a gridded (or hexed), modular board that depicts the location(s) the characters are exploring. Players attempt to complete objectives by co-operating as a squad or independently as the mission takes shape.<br/> All is not safe in the universe, as humanity has been virtually decimated. While salvaging for weapons, energy and anything useful, characters will eventually meet various Xeno&rsquo;s (Xenophobes). Upon contact, merciless Xeno&rsquo;s will quickly aim to destroy the human survivors. Luckily, bio-scanners are able to detect the location of any Threats or possible dangers. Using a combination of stealth and efficient deadly force the humans may have a chance to survive!<br/><br/>Xeno-Terror promotes fast tactical action, exploration, character development and a sense of adventure, as the players not only interact with each other and their enemies, but with the environment that surrounds them. Characters may attempt to search or open crates, lockers, containers and other devices as well as attempt to hack computer terminals, panels or control mechanisms.<br/><br/>The T.A.C. Engine: Xeno-Terror is the first in a series of 5 games that use the multi genre T.A.C. Engine (Tactical Adventure Card Engine) developed by Steve &quot;BLAST&quot; Lefort.<br/><br/>",

This entry currently serves as a placeholder for the announced item and will likely later be removed.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>A real-time battle based card game where players deploy 3 soldiers to the battlefield from their squad deck. Action cards activate these soldiers, as they battle it out in real-time. Soldiers fire, move, dive for cover, and attack the enemy, with the first player to a  certain number of frags declared the winner. Decks from different countries can be combined to create new strategies.<br/><br/>Two players set up on a 5x5 grid and attempt to win through either earning a preset number of points won by kills or achieve some other mission based objective such as capture the flag. The different &quot;game modes&quot; are quite similar to what one would find in the video game upon which it is based.<br/><br/>The game plays in real time so players are forced to find a balance between speed and strategy. Each player has a deck from which they draw cards one at a time and play them as fast as they can (or discard them if they cannot be played). Certain cards trigger a pause in the action at which time all effects (except movement which is handled as it comes up) are resolved.<br/><br/>Each of the 8 different, but non-collectible, squad decks come with:<br/><br/>    60-card deck<br/>    8 Soldier cards<br/>    2 Mission cards<br/>    Double-sided game map<br/>    Rules sheet<br/><br/><br/>",

Turns are bi-monthly. Irish units represent 12-100 men. British units are army battalions, auxiliary police companies, and local constabulary.<br/>COMPONENTS: Two decks of 55 cards each, 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map, 280 &frac12;&rdquo; counters, 77 5/8&rdquo; counters, 24 page rulebook, and 3 player aid cards.<br/>COMPLEXITY: Medium. Somewhere between We the People and Wilderness War.<br/><br/>Each card in the Crown Player&rsquo;s deck may be played for 5 different purposes:<br/><br/>1) To conduct Operations with a number of units determined by the card&rsquo;s value. These can be Patrols that aim to &ldquo;show the flag&rdquo; and catch the foe unawares; small-scale Raids to capture known or suspected Republican activists; and large-scale military Roundups intended to encircle and trap guerrilla units.<br/><br/>2) To cause an Event, of which there are many different types, including: Army Reinforcements, Blockade, Spies, Black &amp; Tans, Motorization, Armored Cars, Mass Arrests, the RAF, and various new laws &ndash; just to name a few.<br/><br/>3) To recruit an Informer in one of the three regions listed on the card. These greatly boost the effectiveness of local Crown operations &ndash; and impede the activities of Republican guerrillas.<br/><br/>Crown forces other than the Irish-born RIC may take revenge for guerrilla attacks and the generally hostile attitude of the natives by destroying civilian property.

If the space simply designates one of four industries (Oil, Steel, Auto, and Food), then the player has gained control of one additional company in that industry and this tracked in a designated area of the scoresheet.  Upon landing on a &quot;Profit&quot; space, the player&rsquo;s Net Worth is multiplied by a percentage amount that rises for controlling multiple companies in a specified industry.  Similarly the impact of landing on &quot;Loss&quot; space for an industry will be scaled according to the player&rsquo;s holdings.<br/><br/>A mathematical operation is performed on the calculator for each player&rsquo;s turn.  Examining the resulting display determines whether the player moves 0 to 3 spaces, although the player sometimes may have more than one choice to select from.

        "description": "The planet Cupido is a peaceful and serene place to live, but its single population leads an intense social life. A young Cupidoian who wants to go out on a date must find nine other Cupidoians of different sexes whom it likes, who all like it, and who all like each other. Cupidoian parents receive government subsidies to help offset their phone bills.<br/><br/>Out of necessity, Cupidoians have a more hard-boiled view of romance than earthlings do. When they reach adolescence, they decide on exactly what they are willing to settle for in a relationship. They do not accept anything less or hold out for anything more. Most earthlings behave in the opposite manner.<br/><br/>While one God of Love is generally enough for Earth, Cupido requires several. Each player of the game is an invisible cupid, hovering around a small town that contains 100 single Cupidoians, ten of each sex. The first player who can get ten Cupidoians of different sexes to marry each other is the winner.<br/><br/>Cupido is a game for two to six players that takes about a half-hour for experienced players to play. The game requires a deck of 100 cards and a &quot;love dart&quot; prop [such as a matchstick or a coin] for each player. Each player will also need a long space on the table to spread out ten cards.<br/><br/>You will have to construct the card deck from images available on this web site. When the deck is completed, look at the cards. Each card represents a Cupidoian. It shows the Cupidoian's name and picture, and three pieces of information about it: it's sex, it's attributes, and it's desire.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Market Maker is a complete, patented stock market simulation, cleverly hidden in a deck of cards.  In Market Maker, you will buy and sell shares of a single company&rsquo;s stock with other players.  At the beginning of every game, the stock price starts at 100, and each card moves the price up or down.  Most Market Maker cards have a news headline on them.  These headlines represent real corporate, government, technology, economic, and other events that have affected the prices of real stocks in the market.<br/> Each player gets 2 private cards, and 5 cards are dealt face-down to the table.  The 2 private cards you were dealt are your Research Reports, and the information on them will move the stock price up or down, depending on whether the news is good or back for shareholders.  Just like the company research reports published by real analyst firms, this information gives you a trading advantage over others with less knowledge.<br/><br/>In Market Maker, you will buy and sell shares of a single company&rsquo;s stock with other players.  To make a profit when trading stocks, you will need to buy shares at a low price and sell them at a higher price.  When you buy low and sell high, the difference between those 2 prices is your profit.  At the end of the of the game, everyone&rsquo;s Research Reports will be made public, and the final closing price will be 100 plus or minus all the cards that were dealt.  Players close out their trades with each other at the final closing price, and the person with the highest profit is the winner!<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.mktmkr.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.mktmkr.com/</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "A manqala game.<br/><br/>From<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Mbelele\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Mbelele</a>:<br/><br/>&quot;Mbelele is a very special mancala game. It is played by the Manga (or: Mba) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They live between Kisangani and Banalia and the game is played along the road that links Kisangani with Buta between kilometer 17 and 118. The Manga are the most southern Sudanese tribe in Upper Zaire. <br/>The board, which measures about a meter, is made from the wood of the Kombo-Kombo (Musanga cecropioides). A beautiful Mbelele board is shown in the National Museum in Kinshasa since 1975. <br/>What makes it a special game is the bizarre board and the fact that although there are two rows on the board, they are not shared by both players, as each plays only on his own row, making it one of the few two cycle games played on two rank boards. According to Townshend the game could also be regarded as a three-row mancala.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board (called mbele p&aacute;pa) consists of two rows of 16 holes and four intermediate holes that are called teka. At the beginning of the game there are three seeds (Sing.: mbelele; Pl.: mbelese) in each hole. On his turn the player takes all the seeds of a hole belonging to his side and sows them in either direction in multiple laps, until he gets to an empty hole. If he reaches the last hole in his side he comes back. <br/>If the last seed is sown in an empty hole opposite to a non-empty enemy hole, the opponent's seeds are captured. <br/>If the move ends in any of the teka, the capture is made in the correspondent hole of the opponent. <br/>A capture made with a singleton captures only a single seed. <br/>It is not allowed to start a move from the last hole but one on the right, going to the right, if it contains only two seeds (he move would end in the same hole). <br/>The winner is the player who captures all of the opponent's seeds. A draw is not possible.&quot;<br/><br/>",

From <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mwambulula\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mwambulula</a>:<br/><br/>&quot;Mwambulula of the Bemba near Kasama in northern Zambia. The game was first described in Europe in 1956 by J. H. Chaplin in the British journal Man.<br/><br/>The boards are most commonly dug into the ground, the predominantly sandy soil making the excavation of holes quite easy. However, wooden boards are also carved.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>A board is used that consists of four rows, each one with eight holes. A player controls the two rows that are closer to him.<br/><br/>At the start the holes in the outer rows contain two seeds, whereas the inner holes are empty. Each player also has 16 seeds in reserve.<br/><br/>On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes that contains at least two seeds anti-clockwise one by one into the following holes of his side.<br/><br/>If the last seed is dropped into a non-empty hole, its contents (including the last seed) are picked up and then distributed in another lap, unless a capture is conducted.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls into an occupied hole in the inner row and the enemy hole directly opposite is also occupied, the contents of both holes in the opponent's opposite file are captured. These enemy seeds are re-entered in a new lap, the sowing beginning at the hole from which the capture was initiated.<br/><br/>A turn ends when the last seed is placed into an empty hole.<br/><br/>Once in a game a player may distribute his reserve by placing in each of his holes one seed. Then, in the same turn, he continues by making an ordinary move as described.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player cannot move.<br/><br/>The player who could move last wins the game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Vienna or Death&quot; is the third volume in our &ldquo;Age of Muskets&rdquo; series and it can be played together with Volume II &quot;Eagles Rising&quot;. It depicts the campaigns that took place during 1796-1797 and again in 1799-1800 in southern Germany, the Rhine and Danube river areas and northern Switzerland. As in Volume II, it's a two-in-one game since the first group of scenarios show the brilliant campaign of 1796 of Archduke Charles of Austria, who defeated and expelled from Germany the French Armies that had launched an invasion across the Rhine; and it also includes other scenarios centered on the Swiss-German side of the Austro-Russian offensive of 1799. They depict the Allied advance into Switzerland and the Alps and their defeat that culminated in the outstanding victory of the French troops led by Moreau at Hohenlinden.<br/><br/>As in Volume I the game includes all the elements that characterized pre-industrial warfare. However, the player will also find some elements distinctive of this campaign, as Alpine terrain, a different map and time scale to reflect the duration of the campaign as well as special rules to play the longest campaign scenarios together with those of Volume II &quot;Eagles Rising&quot;. Given the size of the armies involved most of the scenarios of this Volume are quite adequate for two to four players since there are few headquarters and their size is quite manageable.<br/><br/>Each game contains:<br/>- 2 80x60 cm maps (together form a 60x160 cm map of Switzerland and Southern Germany) <br/>- 8 Terrain overlays used in field battles <br/>- 2 Sets of Player Aid Sheets (3 sheets each)<br/>- 2 General Headquarters display sheets<br/>- 2 Dice (d10)<br/>- 1 Set of Army Sheets (to be photocopied) <br/>- 832 counters (4 sheets)<br/>- 1 Age of Muskets series booklet<br/>- 1 Vienna or Death Exclusive Rules booklet, scenarios, historical and designer notes<br/>&quot;Vienna or Death&quot; is more than just a game. It comes with 6 introductory battle scenarios &ndash;Wurzburg, Neresheim, Schliengen, Ostrach, Stockach, Hohenlinden- to learn the battle rules and 11 campaign scenarios of increasing complexity. From the first (&quot;Mountain warfare&quot; lasting four turns) to the whole campaigns of 1796-97 and 1799-1800. Furthermore, there are scenarios to be played using volumes II and III together to play both campaigns on the three fronts, Germany, Switzerland and Italy!!!<br/><br/>El juego est&aacute; en ingl&eacute;s pero encontrar&aacute;s en esta p&aacute;gina (Apoyo al Jugador) los archivos en espa&ntilde;ol necesarios para jugar &ndash;Hojas de Ayuda, Reglas y Escenarios.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ROMMEL IN FRANCE<br/>Panzers at Dinant, May 1940<br/> The German&rsquo;s 5th Panzer Corps drove the Belgian and French screening forces through the Ardennes forest, then sought to cross the Meuse River near Dinant. A breakthrough here, as well as further south at Sedan, would split the Allied forces in two. A protracted and bloody battle was not in the German war plans...speed was of the essence...the blitzkrieg depended on it...Hitler demanded it!<br/>The French forces, caught off balance by the sudden attack, were initially aided by the terrain but not for long. Rommel was a determined foe and the Meuse River was looked upon as only a temporary delay. It proved a little more than that and provided the vital time for the French armor division to move into the area despite harassing Ju-87 dive bombers and a lack of fuel and organization.<br/>The Panzers soon found how inferior their little armored tanks were against the likes of the Char B, which could split any of the panzer metal from long range. Even the lighter French tanks were as good or better. In fact, Rommel only had 24 Pz IV's, which could take on the French tanks. His remaining 68 Pz II or 91 Czech-38 were simply too weak in armor and and in gun.. The French 47mm gun could rip a Pz III apart from 1500 yds. However, the French use and slowness negated their armor and gun to a large extent. German tanks were faster and well commanded and could take on the French tanks by firing from the rear or flank.<br/>The Battle at Dinant was a tough fight, but across the sweeping vistas of France, the fast moving Germans caused a French command in chaos. Rommel would also have another surprise in another week or so at Arras. There, the British sent chills down the German command when Matilda IIs launched their counterattack. German fire simply bounced off their thick armor causing Rommel to get desperate. He ordered his four 88mm AA guns to be used at antitank weapons. The rest is history.<br/><br/>The game scale:<br/>Each day turn represents about one and half hours (night turns are 5 to 6 hours). Infantry, cavalry, and armor units are battalions, artillery units are regiments. Each hex is approximately one mile across.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by Blitzkrieg Challenged: Dinant.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A word card game of the post-WW2 era.<br/><br/>There are two letters on each card, of different colors, in opposite corners.  The 52 cards make 4 complete alphabets: red A-Z paired with blue Z-A, and green paired with black.  Each card also has a rank 1-13 (for A-M and Z-N), and the Morse code for each letter.  Later editions also have 2 Universal wild cards.  The rules describe two games.<br/><br/>Simple Word Rummy:<br/><br/>Deal 7 cards per player.  In a turn, a player: draws 1 card from the draw or discard pile; plays one meld from the hand or adds to a meld on the table; and discards one.<br/><br/>Melds can be 3+ of the same letter; a straight of 3+ letters in a row; or a word of 2+ letters of the same color (unless there are 2+ of the same letter in the word).  Adding to a meld can extend the set or straight, or change its type (straight ABC + S to word CABS), or even flip them to the other color and letters.<br/><br/>The round ends when a player empties his hand after discarding.  He get the total of the numbers on all cards in hand of all opponents.  Each player with a meld of 5+ cards gets 50 points bonus.  Game is 500 points.<br/><br/>Siamese Word Rummy:<br/><br/>With 2 people, deal 7 cards each and 7 cards in a face-up column; with 3-4, 6 each and a column of 6.  In a turn a player draws 1, melds or adds to a meld (or passes), and discards.<br/><br/>Melds are words only, and must include all the cards in any one row on the table.  Words must be 3+ letters of the same color, unless there are duplicate letters.  The player immediately scores: if a new word, all the cards' points; if a rearranged word, all the cards' points + 25 bonus; if an extended word that preserves the root (plural, past tense, -ING), only the points on the added letters.<br/><br/>As before, the player who empties his hand gets a bonus of 50 points plus the total of the cards in the others' hands; game is 500 points.<br/><br/>The earliest version of this game used the Hebrew alphabet, in celebration of the new nation of Israel.<br/><br/>",

It is possible for more than one player to win. The game set here can be played by itself or added to any of the other Fantasy Nations game sets to increase the size of the playing area and add new races, allowing larger games with more players. Each nation comes with its own special rules, terrain tiles and pieces. Explore all the possibilities!<br/><br/>Fantasy Nations Game sets include: <br/>   The Elf-Dwarf War. &ldquo;The Final Solution to the Dwarven Problem&rdquo; -- Can the free Dwarves of the mountains withstand the assault? Can the humans living in the valleys below remain neutral? Or will they be forced to choose a side? Which will become the dominant Fantasy Nation?<br/><br/>The Sorceress Queen, an epic struggle between the forces of Magic and Technology with armies of magical creatures clashing with the gunpowder weapons and airships of the Devourers of Wisdom.

With chapters detailing both factions present at the infamous Battle for Gate 18, players can reference color uniform and heraldry plates to ensure the accuracy of their miniatures, as well as learn about the weapons their clan carried to war.<br/>Designed for casual play, This Quar&rsquo;s War offers straightforward yet challenging rules for the veteran miniatures player. Utilizing an open orders system and double blind activation, the rules require both a strategic vision and the ability to improvise. Combat resolution takes the form of large dice pools, offering the chaos of war as well as a simple mechanic to seamlessly blend gameplay with the abstraction of combat.<br/>Scenario-based force creation and historical organization charts eliminate the need for army lists and point values, which allows players to use what miniatures they own for missions of their creating. Seven historically accurate missions from the Battle for Gate 18 give players a place to start as well as a chance to see how history may have unfolded differently.

However three shorter scenarios are provided which can be completed relatively quickly: Italy, Spain and Africa. Unlike several other games on the topic this one highlights the overwhelming Roman advantages: better troops, control of the sea, massive manpower, loyal colonies, the Fabian strategy and, eventually, better generals. Disunity in Carthage is also featured. RAC is a boxed game consisting of map, 420 mounted (but not die-cut) counters, a 24 page rules manual and a play sheet containing the game&rsquo;s charts and tables. 6-sided dice are required for play but not provided.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A traditional mancala game played in the Congo.<br/><br/>From Mancala World: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Imbelece\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Imbelece</a><br/><br/>Imbelece is a three-row mancala game of the Genya (also known as Wagenia). They are a small people with a population of just about 19,000 who live near the Stanley Falls not far from Kisangani in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The Genya were fishermen and hunters.<br/><br/>Imbelece is only played by men as it symbolizes fertility and courtship. The Genya use the seeds of the Ngola tree (Pictantus makombo) to play the game. It seems to be related to Embeli and also to some Ethiopian mancala games such as Selus.<br/><br/>Imbelece was first described by the British ethnograph P. Townshend in 1977. Later another description was published by the American L. Russ which was inaccurate (like so many of his accounts).<br/><br/>There was an Imbelece tournament at the Regionale Schule, Niederzissen (Germany), on May 15, 2008, which was won by David Fischbach.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Imbelece is played on a mancala board, which consists of three rows. The outer rows have six holes. The central row has four ordinary holes and a large one in the middle, which is a store. The smaller holes are called moseka (&quot;girls&quot;). A player controls the six holes in the outer row closest to him and the holes to his right of the central row. The store is used by both players.<br/><br/>At the beginning each girl contains three seeds called maana a moome (&quot;boys&quot;) or maana a leemba (&quot;male teenagers&quot;).<br/><br/>On his turn a player distributes the boys of one of his holes counter-clockwise into the following girls. This is called koenda (&quot;visiting the girls&quot;). After a player has dropped the last boy into the right-most girl of his outer row, he continues sowing by visiting his girl in the central row adjacent to the store, then the girl to the right, before he switches to the opponent's outer row.<br/><br/>If the last boy visits a girl, which contains boys, these boys including the visitor are distributed in another lap.<br/><br/>If the last boy makes a population of four boys in a girl of his opponent, this girl is &quot;closed&quot; by putting a leaf on it. The Genya call it kosongo moseka (&quot;marrying a girl&quot;) or koija moseka (&quot;killing a girl&quot;; in other words: turning a girl into a woman). For moseka, you can also say moakali (&quot;newlywed woman&quot;). Then the four boys are distributed in another lap.<br/><br/>Exception:<br/><br/>In the first half-move no girl can be married.<br/><br/>During sowing closed holes are skipped. If the wife was made from one of the player's girls, nothing happens. However, if she is on the opponent's side, a boy must be put into the store, before the sowing continues. This is known as ko-ongesa moakali moleli (&quot;providing food to the newlywed woman&quot; (while her husband is on a hunt)).<br/><br/>A move or a lap may never start from a closed hole nor the store.<br/><br/>The move ends, when the last boy falls into an empty girl or in a wife of the opponent's side (i.e. the store).<br/><br/>The player who could move last wins.<br/><br/>Draws and ties cannot occur.<br/><br/>Strategy<br/><br/>The girls in the lower right and upper left corners are known as ipaoko (&quot;respectable girls&quot;). A boy who marries such a girl in real life, will enhance his social prestige, a player who marries her in the game will have a big advantage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This educational game will reinforce the important information of Roman history that students would typically be tested on during History tests. Learners will reinforce important names, dates, and events, while gaining a deeper understanding for the difficulties of expanding an empire and costs to maintain it. Thus, the students will learn from their own successes and failures while emulating the Roman Empire.<br/><br/>You are Julius Caesar (or Caesar Augustus if you prefer) and you begin the game in Rome, preparing to conquer all of Europe (at least as far as the greatest extent of the Roman Empire). The goal is to conquer all of the territory the Romans once conquered, province by province, by overcoming your enemies, barbarian tribes, and devastating sea storms without being overwhelmed by the swelling costs of maintaining an empire.<br/><br/>The first Caesar to conquer all of the Roman provinces wins.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>     Game board<br/>     Player cards<br/>     Province reference sheets<br/>     Question cards<br/>     Fate cards<br/>     1 6-Sided die<br/>     Denarii (money)<br/>     Colored game pieces<br/><br/><br/>",

On the 8th August, 1963 the travelling post office train was hijacked at Sears Crossing, Buckinghamshire, England. The train driver and co-driver were captured and the train driven a quarter of a mile to a bridge over the road. The mail vans were ransacked by the gang and the 110 mail bags were thrown down to a waiting lorry. The gang then went to Leatherslade Farm, their base for the share out. This was only 20 miles from the hold up.<br/><br/>Based on the actual events of the Great Train Robbery in 1963, this game is a realistic re-enactment of the chase making use of skill, judgement, initative and like life itself, a measure of luck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mentirosa&copy; is a version of liar's dice that is played with Spanish Poker dice and the exclusive Mentirosa Player Tubes available only in this timeless game set.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to guess what your opponents have rolled without going over.<br/><br/>Unlike traditional poker games that require a poker face and mostly silence, Mentirosa encourages you to trash talk, taunt and tease your opponents. It's the main strategy, hence the name of the game: Mentirosa (Spanish: liar).<br/><br/>EACH SET INCLUDES:<br/><br/>* 6 Mentirosa Player's Tubes<br/>    * 6 sets of casino-grade poker dice<br/>    * Loser Chips : These chips will help you keep track of the winners and losers.<br/>    * Mentirosa Professional or Travel storage case<br/>    * Instructions in English and Spanish.<br/><br/>2 to 20 Players (with extra sets) Ages 10 and up.<br/><br/><br/>How to play Mentirosa<br/><br/>In this version of liar's dice, the object of the game is to guess the number rolled, of any suit, among all the dice.<br/><br/>To begin the game, each player rolls a single die in open view of other players. The player<br/>with the highest suit starts the play. If a tie occurs, only those players in the tie roll again.<br/><br/>Players throw five poker dice into their tube. They look in their tube to see what they rolled.<br/><br/>A turn begins when the starting a player makes a call, for example three Jacks. This<br/>means they believe that there are at least three Jacks among all the dice in play.<br/><br/>The next player has two options:<br/><br/>1. Raise the call. This is done by, raising the suit called, raising the number of dice<br/>      called, or both. In this example, the next player could call three Queens, three<br/>      Kings, three Aces, or four of anything else. Any of these would be higher than the<br/>      three Jacks called. Or...<br/><br/>2. Challenge the call. When a player challenges a call, he or she does not believe<br/>      that the hand called, in this case three Jacks, exists among all the dice in play.<br/>      To challenge, a player raises their tube, revealing their hand and signaling to the<br/>      other players to do the same. At this point, the suit in play is counted.<br/><br/>In this example, if there are at least three Jacks among all the dice in play, the<br/>challenger receives a loser chip and a new turn begins. If there are less than three Jacks among the dice in play, the calling player receives a loser chip and a new turn begins.<br/><br/>The loser begins the next turn. There is no passing. Once a call is raised, it is the next player&rsquo;s turn and he or she has the same two options.The game continues in this manner, player after player, until a call is challenged.<br/><br/>Once a player receives 5 loser chips, they are out of the game. Last man standing wins!<br/><br/><br/>History of Mentirosa<br/><br/>The game of Mentirosa&reg; is known in many countries, by many different names. Its ancestry comes from a close relative, Cubilete, a game known to have been played as early as the Roman Era, especially in Spain.<br/><br/>Traveling to the Americas during the Spanish Empire, it became widely popular in Cuba and other parts of Latin America during the 19th and 20th centuries.<br/><br/>It is rumored that Mentirosa came about when the American GI's in Cuba combined the popular American game, Liar's Poker, with the cups and Spanish Poker dice used to play Cubilete.<br/><br/>Arriving in South Florida with exiled Cubans in the 1950s, Mentirosa&rsquo;s 21st century rebirth will give a new generation of players the opportunity to enjoy this classic game the way it was meant to be played.<br/><br/>Source: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.mentirosa.org\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.mentirosa.org</a><br/><br/>",

Combat in both World Wars rapidly became a series of vicious, small unit actions, a classic confrontation at close quarters with no holds barred. As in most wars, the dirty business of winning battles fell to the infantryman. Despite the vast array of sophisticated and deadly weapons available to all sides, success or failure ultimately depended upon the ability of the foot soldier to take or hold ground.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a set of 18 pieces. The game allows for two players to enter an alliance against the third. If two players engage in a coordinated attack against the third, they are entered into an alliance automatically. The player not in an alliance gains a more powerful king piece and easier win conditions to counterbalance the alliance. As in other games in the chess family, the goal is to checkmate an opponent's king. A player not in an alliance need only checkmate one player to defeat both of them.<br/><br/>Unlike traditional games in the chess family, which have a thin military theme, kokusai sannin shogi has a thin political one, with pieces named after concepts such as public opinion, diplomacy and propaganda.<br/><br/>Incorporates information from: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannin_shogi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sannin_shogi</a><br/><br/>",

Passes must not violate standard offside rules.<br/><br/>Any given pawn can only move two spaces in a turn, but the board includes &quot;slide&quot; lines that allow bursts of speed on offence or defence. One player takes the puck away from the other by moving a pawn onto the same space as the puck carrier (the pawns have a peg to hold them on top of the puck), &quot;checking&quot; his opponent into an adjacent circle.<br/><br/>Most challenging of all for all players: a penalty is called when either team fails to complete its three-element move within 15 seconds! Going over the limit means you lose one of your pawns for the next three turns.<br/><br/>While intended to be played for fun, it includes a significant teaching component, including dotted lines on the board showing the areas of responsibility for different positions, and a set of 18 Hockey Tips listed inside the box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The SHIP Card Games are easy-to-learn and start having Fun fast.  Space N Time uses a sci-fi theme but, enjoyment of SNT goes way beyond the sci-fi niche.  The Object is to collect Cards &amp; match &lsquo;sets&rsquo; for points. Each Player starts with 6 Cards. A Players &ldquo;turn&rdquo; is called a Time Loop &ndash; which consists of 3 Steps: 1) Turn in &lsquo;sets&rsquo; of Cards (example: 3 Shuttle Cards = 5 pts.), 2) Attack another Player (optional), 3) Draw two Cards from the Deck. You do not have to do Steps 1 &amp; 2 but, drawing your two Cards officially ends your Loop.  Players have an option to Attack any other Player, following the Card Rank, to gain Cards or get rid of unwanted Cards.  Game play can go to a point threshold like 100 points or Players can just keep track of &ldquo;wins&rdquo; &amp; play to 5 or 10 &ldquo;wins&rdquo;.<br/><br/>There are no &quot;histories to learn&quot; or magic spells to keep track of.  The basic nature of SHIP Card Games is not complicated (&ldquo;Fun for all ages&rdquo;), but there are subtleties and nuances that provide a challenge and sophistication that&rsquo;s not initially apparent.  In addition, BONUS OPTIONS add a strategic vector and extends the Game.  The SHIP Card Games can be easy going or get fast paced when you and you're friends are 'into it'.  Games can last for minutes or hours.  Combine multiple Decks and you can have as many people in a Game as you like and play longer Games.  DON&rsquo;T FORGET, you can also play SOLO, the solitaire version!<br/><br/>As you get to know the SHIP Card Games, you'll discover many nuances and preferences. There are strategies concerning: turning in 'sets', Battling, when to 'retire' a Generation, ending the Game and others. Games can be played to: a point threshold like 100 points, the 1st Player to get 10 &quot;wins&quot;, the 1st Player to get 10 Starships, the 1st Player to 'retire' their last Generation, and more. You can also play SOLO, the solitaire version - which has BONUS OPTIONS, too.<br/><br/>",

The rules of the game make it feel like a real Nascar race, with accidents, wrecks, a draft effect, turbo accelerations, yellow flag formations, and so on. It is a really exciting game and all my son's friends are now converted as well. Additionally the game has great educational value (kids learn how to add and multiply really fast with the dice) and offers a great fun factor with deserved wins and unlikely comebacks!<br/><br/>The game is played with 2 dice, up to 42 cars, and can be played by 1-15 players at the same time! Obviously, the mat can also be used as a support for imaginary races or any car game involving a racing track.<br/><br/>The mat is made of Vinyl and is weather resistant.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A 32 page booklet for adding fantasy elements such as magic users and their spells and various monsters and their special abilities to your existing set of miniatures rules. The inspiration comes from the popular literature of the time with an emphasis on the classic thematic elements.<br/><br/>There are three different types of magic users to add to your army:  Druids, Shamans, and Sorcerers.  Each gets 10 spell points to chose from the 25 available spells (cost 1-4 points each) but is limited thematically to what they may chose.  Adding a magic user to your army is expensive however, costing roughly the same point value as a Dragon, Giant, or a Commanding General.<br/><br/>Twenty different classic monsters are created for your army by following a simple template system.  Here is an example of how to get stats for a goblin character by making conversions to your normal miniatures rules:<br/><br/>Goblins:<br/>Fight as:  Light, medium or light-medium infantry only.<br/>Movement:  As designated troop type.<br/>Frontage:  As designated troop type.<br/>Special:  Like Orcs, Goblins loose one morale grade for reaction test purposes in bright sunlight.<br/>Limits:  No more than one Goblin unit in an army may be designated as elite.  Goblins may never be classed as regular troops.<br/><br/>(User Summary)<br/><br/>",

Competing ideological federations are battling for control to unify the world under their principles one nation at a time.<br/><br/>As General of a federation, you are to leverage your innate capabilities to master the market, leverage trades, and then develop and command your military to conquer provinces.<br/><br/>Up to four players can play and each player is provided with armies comprised of Caltrops (Soldiers), ArmTors (Armored Units), Threshers (Sea Units), and Fight Kites (Air Units) each with specific capabilities and costs. Each individual playing piece can be further developed with enhanced capabilities depending on the level of training a player is willing to invest.  The playing board is comprised of hex tiles that carry with them specific assets that enable players to accumulate assets and money. Players can use money and assets to create manufacturing plants (Barracks, Armories, Harbors, and Hangars) which in turn can be used to create armies.

Field of Battle: WW2 includes ratings and organizational charts for the British, French, German, Polish, Italian, Japanese, Soviet, and United States armies.<br/><br/>Field of Battle: WW2 is designed to give players the feel for commanding battalions, regiments, divisions, and more in a miniature WW2 environment. Games with a division per side can easily be resolved in 2 to 4 hours. Field of Battle: WW2 is designed using game processes used in the popular Field of Battle rules that gives all players an equal opportunity to act during the game.<br/><br/>Field of Battle: WW2 is not a game of skirmishes or low level actions, but rather one of battles of up to Division size or larger.<br/><br/>Field of Battle: WW2 uses companies as the combat element, and battalions as the maneuver element.<br/><br/>The only troops represented as units on the tabletop are maneuver and combat elements - infantry companies, armor companies, and anti-tank gun/artillery companies. There are no Heavy Weapon companies &ndash; no separate machine gun or mortar units. The effects of supporting machine gun and mortar companies are abstracted in the game mechanics and card system.<br/><br/>",

It packs substantial but managable depth amount of depth into an intuitive and surprisingly streamlined gameplay. Every game is tense and usually close-fought.<br/><br/>In Rubicon, players take the part of prominent citizens and vie with each other for control of Rome through influence or military domination. Players run for election, court popularity with the People and Senate, attract influential supporters, vote on crucial issues in the Senate, and gain the loyalty of battle-hardened veterans by slaughtering barbarian hordes. Only one player may win, but cooperation is necessary to survive till the end.<br/><br/>With several paths to victory and the possibility of ever-shifting alliances, success is hard to come by. In a harsh world, only the strong will survive. Will it be you?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zombie A-Go-Go is unique in the miniature games market, as it is based on the concept of co-operative play that is more common to boardgames. That means that each player brings their own Hero, and a handful of Zombies that offset their value in skills and equipment. Our game is designed to fill in the gap between all of the wonderful Zombie Boardgames, and more traditional Miniature Skirmish or Tactical games, that already exist.<br/><br/>Our game is setup to give the feel of &quot;Traditional Zombies&quot; in modern times. It can also be easily modified if you prefer &quot;Voodoo&quot; or &quot;Chemically Altered&quot; Zombies, or to play in another &quot;Era&quot; like antiquity or the near future. These rules include a vast collection of information that makes this an &quot;all in one game&quot; that should accommodate most &quot;Eras&quot;. These rules are designed for individually mounted 25 to 28mm figures. They can be readily adapted to 20mm or 15mm if that better suits your club.<br/><br/>This game was designed for Wargamers, by Wargamers, so it &quot;fluff light&quot; and packed with what you actually need to play on the tabletop. Future supplments will be offered to expand the game, but are not required to enjoy this genre. In addition to increase the value of the book for you we have also provided:<br/><br/>1) Complete Character Generation with over 50 Pre-generated characters<br/>2) Over 15 Ranged Weapons and more than 30 Close Combat Weapons<br/>3) Basic Vehicle Rules with over 30 Pre-generated vehicles for land, air, and sea<br/>4) a Scenario Generator to help quickly make pickup games<br/>5) 8x Basic scenarios, 2x advanced scenarios, and a 4x mission mini-campaign. Several of these also include additional &quot;options&quot; to readily modify the scenario conditions, or to use them for competitive play with or without a moderator.<br/>6) Optional Rules (Fog, Night, etc.)<br/>7) Basic rules for Buildings and Barricades<br/><br/>And don&rsquo;t forget<br/><br/>Zombies you can outrun - the mistakes of your fellow Heroes you cannot.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The rules are set at an operational rather than a tactical level. The system is based upon a detailed analysis of ship and weapon abilities for the period. Gunnery uses a fire effect table with no to hit rolls. Torpedo attacks also use a simple system. The game effects represent those significant hits which cripple a ship&rsquo;s ability to fight effectively. The ground scale of 1 cm to 500 yards (4 cm to the nautical mile) and time scale of 1 turn to 15 minutes enable realistic movement and gun ranges, combined with the problems of locating and identifying the enemy.<br/><br/>The system incorporates national skill ratings for commanders and crew, effects of weather and night, radar, hidden movement and spotting, carrier and air operations.<br/><br/>The rules come complete with 700+ ships and aircraft covering the era from 1890 through to 1945.<br/><br/>(Publishers Description)<br/><br/>",

Once over a crab fishing ground, the crew sets crab pots with the hopes of scoring a large catch. After some time soaking in the cold icy waters, the crew returns to retrieve their crab pots. Will the crab pots be chock full of crab or will they be empty?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, fishing for crab isn't just about setting and retrieving crab pots. The crew must repair breakdowns caused by storms that wreak havoc to the crab vessel systems and even it's precious cargo. From the North, an ice pack creeps down and invades the crab fishing ground. Drifting in the sea are ice flows that wreak havoc on crab pots. As the season progresses, the temperature drops causing crab vessel systems to fail if too far North, and the value for crab slowly drops challenging the crew to work hard to quickly fish the crab grounds.<br/><br/>Finally, after the crab fishing season is over, each player determines who is the most profitable and has earned the bragging rights for the season.<br/><br/>Will you be &quot;On the Crab&quot;?<br/><br/>Winner of the Congress of Gamers - Best Game for the 2010 Rio Grande Design Contest<br/><br/>",

But first they must survive...<br/><br/>Players will move about the ship and through the transporter gate exploring and finding much needed supplies and scientific knowledge.  Each player will have their own agendas.  The Civilian Scientists want to learn as much as they can about the worlds they are stopping at as well as the alien ship.

Most of all, it gives you a set of simple, fast and enjoyable skirmish rules for the late medieval or renaissance period. There is also, dare I say it, an additional section which allows for more horrifying encounters in the ruins. Not for everyone, I know, but we enjoyed them and I hope that you do too.<br/><br/>To play, you will need 2d10 and 2d6, a ruler marked in inches, two or more sets of around 8-10 figures and some sort of ruin or building model.&quot;<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>These relatively simple rules cover both combat and searching for items in the ruins. Rules set includes melee and ranged attacks, armor values, morale, etc. Each side gets a pool of points with which to buy a small skirmishing force. Each unit gets outfitted with armor and weaponry (with more effective items costing more). Set also comes with an appendix for Horror/Fantasy game play, which introduces undead creatures, spell casting, etc.<br/><br/>Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #161 (February 2001)<br/><br/>",
