Patriots and absolutists sink into collusion to force mutually exclusive projects that can cost them their lives. They are writing history and there are members of the town who want much more than &quot;to know what it is about&quot;. They want to fight for that new Nation that is brewing...<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME<br/><br/>Each player represents an urban worker from colonial Buenos Ayres (a water carrier, a lamplighter, a milkman, a seller of candles, cakes or feather dusters) and -adhering to the revolution that is brewing- tries to play his support by moving between patriots and absolutists (cards of all 20 characters) in such a way as to visit only one per table series so as not to be singled out as a conspirator by the absolutist side.<br/><br/>If he can successfully raffle 6 visits to patriots in the same table series, he will have gained two degrees of prominence among the revolutionary forces, raising his prestige among the patriotic &quot;sparks&quot; who are stationed in front of the town hall. If he is unsuccessful, everyone else except him will move up a step in prominence in the revolution.<br/><br/>The player who reaches the level 7 Town Hall arcade will have won the game.<br/><br/>",

A thousand oligarchic families own &quot;La Argentina&quot; and manage the State as part of their properties, making all kinds of deals and looting of the national treasury. In this decade, electoral and economic fraud, repression of popular sovereignty and abuses of power of all kinds are the order of the day.<br/><br/>To carry out its negotiations, the Argentine Oligarchy uses collaborators of the same kind. It is precisely there, where our players come into play...<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME<br/><br/>The representative of the thousand families delegates his affairs to the first player next to the loot box, which is passed from hand to hand around the table. Each player takes advantage of the opportunity to get hold of the deals that he contains for individual benefit, or to take a character token with whom he collaborates.<br/><br/>After the round and with the box again in possession of the representative of the Argentine Oligarchy, he sees that some of his peers have cheated the interest of the ruling class for personal gain. Immediately afterwards he -offended and betrayed- he interrogates them to identify his henchmen trying to discover who or who have &quot;abusers of his trust&quot; and thus be able to recover his businesses for the set of the thousand oligarchic families. But if the deadline is met, if the Argentine Oligarchy has not managed to recover all the negotiations, it loses the game and the Prosecutors of the Homeland win.<br/><br/>Will the Argentine oligarchy be able to recover all the stolen contracts? Will he take a false step by accusing a National Prosecutor in vain? What will be the fate of the thieves if the oligarchy falls? What luck will the Ruffians have with the different outcomes? A game of simulation and deception where each group of interests will want to win.<br/><br/>",

The last ten will take place at Quinta 17 de Octubre, located in the small town of Puerta de Hierro, on the outskirts of Madrid, Spain. From there, he will begin to navigate a political labyrinth of intrigues, loyalties, and betrayals that will finally lead him to return triumphantly to the country in 1972 and, the following year, to be elected constitutional president of Argentina for the third time.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME<br/><br/>This game takes historical facts as its basis and translates them into the cards of the notable personalities of that turbulent time, which players must secretly handle to obtain a specified number of legitimation tokens, thus achieving ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, each player will keep a secret card in his hand (which could vary on his turn) and that represents his contact of influence and the one who will be the one to carry his message to General Per&oacute;n. You will want to make sure that the person closest to the General has the message from him at the end of the day, so that it can be delivered with priority.<br/><br/>The game takes place in rounds that ends when the insert deck is exhausted at the end of a turn, or if all the players except one are eliminated from it. In the first case, the player with the most influence wins a standing token; in the second case, the one left standing wins.<br/><br/>A player is declared the winner of the game after collecting a certain number of influence tokens, based on the number of players.<br/><br/>",

Keeping his identity to himself, each player must simulate, deceive and deduce before the others to win the Silvio Ballan Award for best storyteller.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME<br/><br/>Each player must try to discover the identity of the other players without revealing their own. To achieve this, he must perform actions in order to obtain resources. He must then use these resources to discover information about the other players in order to eliminate them.<br/><br/>The storytellers take turns and carry out one or several actions depending on the resources and the decisions they decide to make.<br/><br/>Thus, each player shows off their best capacities for imagination, lies, deception and deduction -embodying the skills of the different writers, most of the time without being them- while trying to unmask the rest of the players.<br/><br/>The last player left without being eliminated wins...<br/><br/>",

The game is played using cards of five colors - each color has its own ability and rarity in the deck.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player is given in secret their role card and their detonator. On their role card is written their winning hand - each of the five roles has a unique winning hand. Each detonator is coded to one of the other players&rsquo; role cards, but nobody knows who has which role. The deck is then shuffled and placed between all the players, and plays three cards onto the table face-up for everyone to see.<br/><br/>Play is turn-based, and on a player&rsquo;s turn they can do one of four things:<br/>        <br/>DRAW a card either from the face-up set of three or from the deck itself.<br/>PLAY a card from their hand, activating its ability and putting it in a discard pile<br/>LOCK a card face-up in front of them, registering it towards their winning hand, or swap one of their already face-up cards with one from their hand.<br/>DETONATE their target by playing two of their target&rsquo;s winning hand cards, and correctly call out the player with that role. That player loses the game, and gives the player who detonated them their new target.<br/><br/>The game ends whenever a player has assembled their role&rsquo;s winning hand in front of them, or whenever there is only one player left standing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They have improved rules of the game and completely new cards.<br/><br/>This game is not suitable for people without a sense of humor. In people who are not devoid of good taste, it can cause a sharp cough, redness, difficulty breathing, and remorse. It should not be used with alcohol or other legal abusers. Let's face it - it should also not be used under the influence of any illegal means, even if legalization is only a matter of time.<br/><br/>Psychodropsy: Season 2 is a standalone game. No Psychodropsy: Season 1 or Limited Edition Psychodropsy required to play. Psychodropsy: Season 2 can be mixed freely with Season 1 cards.<br/><br/>The cards of both seasons can be mixed in any combination without fear - each card has an indication of which season it comes from. The Limited Edition cards are slightly larger than the Season 2 cards, but can be mixed and matched for tons of new possibilities.<br/><br/>Psychodropsy: Season 2 is the continuation of the first season of the game. The brand new cards are kept in the same cultural (though quite open) style as the first season. In the second season, there are cards that talk about deviations. And it's just about those deviations that really affect people. You won't believe how strange things can...lift people's spirits.<br/><br/>",

The author's personal preference for 'Volley &amp; Bayonet' prompted him to write these rules.<br/><br/>Scales and Assumptions:<br/><br/>These rules are designed to be played on a table top onto which has been super-imposed a grid of approximately 3.25 inches (83mm) square.

For the purpose of these rules the distance across the diagonals of the grid square are counted as being the same as the distance across the flat sides.<br/><br/>Each grid square represents about 500 yards.<br/><br/>Each move represents about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(formerly known as Ancient Warfare)<br/><br/>These rules cover classical warfare in the ancient world from the rise of Egypt to the fall of Rome.<br/><br/>The essence of Ancient Conquest is command and the role of the general on the battlefield. Using simple mechanics, the player will find himself thrust into the role of battle manager on a very personal level, and in a very chaotic environment.<br/><br/>Soldiers in the game are rated for their equipment, but also their experience level and specific skills. There are no abstract &quot;troop classes&quot;, although you will find that certain combinations of training and equipment necessarily encourage specific deployments on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Ancient Conquest, on the other hand, was created from the very beginning with historical encounters in mind. Units were tested not against the theory of how they ought to have done against different troop types, but rather against the reality of their historical performance in actual battles.<br/><br/>More than anything else, the atmosphere of the game is different from that of most other ancients rules. Many rules are rigid and chess-like in their portrayal of ancient warfare, so that the games are very cerebral in nature. Ancient Conquest is anything but that. Ancient battles were confused and <br/>violent. They were personal and visceral, not impersonal and abstract. Above all else, Ancient Conquest aims at reproducing that sense.<br/><br/>Oracle cards introduce an additional element of unpredictability to the game, and provide players with an additional means of influencing play.<br/><br/>The ground scale using the recommended base size is 1:1500, which means that one millimeter equals one and a half meters of actual ground. (One inch equals about 40 meters of real terrain.) This means that the frontage of a base is 90 meters (about 100 yards).<br/><br/>In general, a stand represents infantry or cavalry deployed four to six ranks deep and as many files wide as will fit in a 90 meter frontage (about 100 files for infantry or 65 files for cavalry). Formations of greater depth than four to six ranks are represented by placing multiple bases one behind another.<br/><br/>Strength of Stands<br/>Infantry: 500 infantry (4-6 ranks of about 100 files each).<br/>Cavalry: 330 cavalry (4-6 ranks of about 65 files each).<br/>Chariots: 100 small (2-3 man) or 50 large (4-5-man, and all scythed) chariots<br/>Elephants: 10 elephants (in one or two ranks)<br/>Engines: 20 bolt throwers or 10 stone throwers.<br/> For very large battles, double scale armies (1 stand per 1000 infantry or 650 cavalry) may be used, and for small actions half scale may be used (1 stand per 250 infantry or 160 cavalry) may be used.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game proposes a twist of the classic word game. Tiles have poker-style decoration, and the scoring system is based on that, with one exception: all letter have the same value (1 point), but if all the letters in a word are the same color (black or red) the score is doubled, and if they all are the same suit tripled. Additionally, the first word in the board is also played according to a different rule: it has to start in one of the four poker tiles symbols printed on the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ADVENTURES IN DEVIL&acute;S CREEK<br/><br/>Adventures in Devil&rsquo;s Creek is set in the wild west of a fictional America in the small town of Fortune&rsquo;s Creek.<br/><br/>Fortune&rsquo;s Creek was once a thriving small town that was a sought-after destination for treasure hunters and traders. The mines held vast amounts of gold and precious stones. The river that flows through the town kept bringing smaller crystals and sometimes even diamonds with it. This earned the city the name Fortune&rsquo;s Creek. Anyone could get rich here, you just have to reach out and grab your hand.<br/><br/>But with wealth, corruption also found its way into the city and criminals soon regulated all trade routes. The legislature found itself powerless, but after three sheriffs disappeared in a very short time, the government sent a small army from Washington to ensure law and order in the city. However, the current rulers of Fortune&rsquo;s Creek were unwilling to give up their gold mine without resistance and so it came to a wild, brutal battle that lasted for several days. Not only did criminals and crooks fall, many innocent people also died in the hail of bullets. After two days the last bullet was fired and the then corrupt mayor McKanzy was executed by the American army shortly afterwards. The city was now back in the hands of the state.<br/><br/>The events seemed to have affected not only the city but also the countryside, because the gold veins in the mines dried up and the river no longer brought any glittering stones with it. The once rich trading city became poorer and poorer. Where there was one joy and confidence, there was now more and more despair. This is how the city got its nickname Devil&rsquo;s Creek. Only those who ventured deep into the mines could find gold - if they came out again. Those who made it reported strange creatures that have since found their home there. Soon hardly any people dared to venture into the widely ramified mine systems and the city was forgotten by history. You and your small group will end up in Devil&rsquo;s Creek. Maybe you can get to the bottom of this and bring the city back to its former size.<br/><br/>The setting is enriched with &quot;low fantasy&quot; elements. You take on the role of three adventurers, take jobs in the local saloon and roam the countless mines of Fortune&rsquo;s Creek, which were once rich in gold veins and are now inhabited by all sorts of creatures and other rabble.<br/><br/>WHAT DO I NEED TO PLAY?<br/><br/>To play, you need a piece of squared paper, a pencil, at least three 6-sided dice and one 4-sided dice. You should also have the attached cards printed out and arranged in a stack ready to hand.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>Adventures in Devil&rsquo;s Creek can best be classified under the category of &quot;Dungeon Diver&quot;. You put together a group of three different characters (Brawler, Valkyrie, Voodoo Priest, White Witch, Gunslinger or Bounty Hunter) and set off to explore the local mines. Before or between the explorations, supplies can be replenished in the city, quests can be accepted or you can just relax and heal your wounds. It can be played by 1 to 3 players. The opponents are rolled and their behavior is determined by the drawing of cards.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY<br/><br/>After creating the characters, you take a piece of squared paper, on which you draw the spaces that have been thrown out of the mine. The use of a DIN A5 sheet is recommended. Dice out the first room and draw it in the middle on one edge. Then you roll the dice on the space and resolve the encounters. If you defeat a boss, you have cleared the mine. The mine systems are reset and rerolled with each visit.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "October 15th, 1600 saw the bloodiest and most decisive battle of feudal Japan: the battle of Sekigahara.  The victor- the Tokugawa Shogunate- would rule Japan for the next 250 years and was the Last Daimyo. The battles leading up to that decisive moment became known as 'The Warring States period'. Now you can shape the course of Japanese history through skillful use of your loyal clans and manipulation of your allies whilst taking full advantage of natural events as they occur.<br/>As one of 2-4 players, you will control one or more of feudal clans trying to establish supremacy over all of Japan. The game will start in 1554 and turns will represent about two years of time, ending no later than 1614 (30 turns). The game will include those events that defined this great struggle. Featuring floods, earthquakes, typhoons, peasant rebellions, pirates, famine and much more. There will be epic sieges and titanic open battles, as well as the chance to assassinate hated enemies.<br/><br/>The map will consist of one 22&quot;x34&quot; map covering all of mainland Japan and the two southern islands (Kyushu and Shikoku). Map labels will be in easy-to-read English font with accompanying Japanese characters to add historical flavor to proceedings. There will be 2 countersheets of 9/16&quot; counters representing the 8 different major clans and 8 different minor clans, troop markers, plus various game effect counters. Two decks of cards (110 total) will be included.  A full color rulebook will include synopses of some of the major players of this period (the Sengoku Jidai) as well as other fascinating historical tidbits to enhance the flavor of the game.<br/><br/>The basic game will be quick to learn and easy to play but the players will have a host of optional rules that will add greater detail, such as battle tactics, different types of soldiers (spearmen, samurai, arquebusiers, etc.), defections, and alliances. There will be a number of scenarios, allowing one to play anything from the full war (1554-1614) to shorter campaigns.<br/><br/>Depending on interest, there may also be an extension to allow players to start from the traditional beginning of the Sengoku Jidai, 1467. If you think you are ready to test your skill to become the Last Daimyo, Bring It On Games is ready for you to say, &ldquo;bring it on&rdquo;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In June of 1962, Frank Morris, Clarence and John Anglin did the impossible.  They escaped from the inescapable prison of Alcatraz.  Or did they?  Situated in San Francisco Bay, over a mile from the mainland, with icy, cold waters infested with man-eating sharks, the prison was said to be impossible for any inmate to find freedom.  Over 14 previous escaped had proven that - but after their escape attempt, Morris and the Anglin brothers were never found.  Many people think they escaped and had remained hidden for the rest of their lives.<br/><br/>Escape from the Rock is a new game designed by Adam Starkweather.  From one to six players each play a prisoner that must find a way to escape from Alcatraz.  The prisoners a player will play will be one of the actual convicts of the famous prison. These include such notables as AL Capone, Meyer &ldquo;Mickey&rdquo; Cohen, Frank Morris (who actually escaped), John Anglin (who also escaped), Robert &ldquo;The Birdman&rdquo; Stroud, Whitey Bulger, Creepy Karpis, Machine Gun Kelly, as well as many others. Each prisoner has a unique set of skills that will make playing that prisoner a unique experience.<br/><br/>The game will have a 22 by 34 inch map, two decks of 55 poker quality cards, a sheet of 5/8ths counters, dice, and a beautiful box to keep everything nice and locked up for when you aren&rsquo;t playing.  The game will have three general phases to the game - getting out of your cell, navigating your way to the water&rsquo;s edge, and then finding a way to cross the icy waters of San Francisco Bay.  The first one to escape and live to tell the tale is the winner.  The game will be a wargame mechanically so this will be an ideal game to introduce the concepts of wargaming to your non-wargaming friends - have a copy of a Bulge game standing by.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On a volcanic moon, your mission is to rescue a prisoner from a bunker by avoiding robot sentries. Time is limited!<br/><br/>You lay out a grid of 6x8 floor tiles (incl. 2 lava tiles that evrything dies on) plus a door tile on top where the prisoner is. Then place 6 robot sentries on the grid and your 4 rescuers carrying a crate with a protective suit for the prisoner below the grid.<br/><br/>You move your team onto the grid from any point below trying to reach the prisoner behind the door on top. Once freed, you must take the prisoner back to the bottom of the grid where your team started. When successful, you win if you have at least one team member and the prisoner still in play.<br/><br/>During a turn first you roll a 1D6 for the robot movement. The robots kill any team member that is on the same tile with them. Then you can move each team member 1 tile in any direction.<br/>Repeat until either you rescued the prisoner or all of your team members are dead. Easy mode gives you 25 turns, hard mode only 20 turns to accomplish this.<br/><br/>So, are you up to the challenge? Can you rescue the prisoner in time?<br/><br/>",

The system uses the same maps as War in Europe (WIE), with updated graphics and a more detailed terrain analysis. The counters have been upgraded and are presented with historical identifications. The game system utilizes a Move/Fight, Fight/Move sequence of play to portray simply doctrinal differences among contending armed forces. It also utilizes headquarters units to project logistics and combat support capabilities.<br/><br/>Drive on Leningrad covers the Army Group North drive on Leningrad in 1941, and the ensuing Soviet counteroffensive. It ends with the German relief of the Demyansk Pocket.<br/><br/>Each game turn (GT) represents around one week in clear weather and two weeks in mud and snow game turns. Each hex represents 20 miles (32.5 km) across. German, Finnish, and Western Allied units are shown mostly as division-sized units, with Soviet and Axis Allied units depicted as corps.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game can be played in person or remotely. The topics to investigate each round are guided by Tech Deck cards. Newsworthy is a blend of a conversational game, an investigative game, and a social game. A player voting mechanic allows articles to be rated to score points. It has a unique game mechanic because players seek information from outside of the game on the internet.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE &ndash; Players/teams try to score points by finding news articles that meet the objectives set by Tech Deck cards.<br/>GAME PLAY &ndash; Each round, a Tech Deck card is revealed which sets the topic. Players then search for articles based on the topic for that round. There is a voting mechanic where players can vote on the articles that have been found to score points.<br/>SCORING AND WINNING - If playing in Blitz play mode, the game ends in one round. In normal mode, with more than 2 players, the game ends when a player scores 10 points; otherwise, it ends when a player has 5 points. If there are ties, the tied players share the victory. Players may decide to continue to play and continue the conversation! I have seen rounds go an entire hour! The point of the game is to foster interesting conversation after all.<br/>THEME &ndash; Players are investigative reports for a news agency<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players will take on the role of a wandering wastelander attempting to survive post-apocalyptic earth. Players must use equipment and action cards to overcome various obstacles and threats. In the process, they will enhance themselves and the survivors they rescue with loot, uncover lore, and stab their fellow players in the back.<br/><br/>This game is played in a series of 10 rounds consisting of two phases. The first phase of the round is the player action phase.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Action Phase<br/>During this round, players may take the following actions. Steal a card from another player (excluding a survivor card), apply a piece of equipment to a survivor, or draw from the cache deck.<br/><br/>Steal a Card: When stealing a card, the individual having the card stolen will shuffle the fail card and the desired card together. The thief will then pick from one of the two cards. The card is not stolen if the fail card is selected from the two.<br/><br/>Apply Survivor Equipment: A player may apply spare equipment cards to any survivors they may have acquired. If the survivor is lost due to failing an event, the equipment applied to the survivor is also lost.<br/><br/>Draw a Card: If a player selects this option, draw one card from the cache deck.<br/><br/>After performing one of the above described actions, the player may then apply or remove equipment cards to themselves by placing them in front of themselves.<br/><br/>Finally, the first phase ends with players ensuring they have no more than five cards in their hands (unless they have a backpack applied). To accomplish this, they may discard any additional cards and place them in the discard pile or give spare cards to any other player.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Event Phase<br/>During this phase, all players will be presented with an event. If they defeat the obstacle, they gain a prize as annotated on the card. If a player cannot defeat an obstacle, they must perform the loss action. Each player does not get an individual event. One event card is drawn, and all players must overcome that same event. If a player has zero survivors and the loss condition is to discard a survivor card, that player is eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>To defeat an obstacle, the players must have a stat number equal to or greater than the stat/stats being challenged. There are four stats that could be challenged, and those are Strength (STR), Accuracy (ACC), Intelligence (INT), and Stamina (STA). Each piece of equipment has stat/stats. Add the stat/stats required for the challenge to determine if you will defeat it.<br/>Note: Equipment cards can not be equipped or unequipped during this phase.<br/><br/>Winning: Have the most survivor cards at the end of the ten rounds.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the early 1990&rsquo;s a Russian antarctic expedition began drilling through the ice to a fresh water Lake dubbed Lake Vostok.<br/><br/>On Feb 2012 they succeeded in drilling more than 2,000 miles. It took more than 30 years.<br/><br/>Many raised concerns of the risks of breaking a barrier to a lake sealed off between 15 and 34 million years. But someone made the call that breaking this barrier was worth the risk.<br/><br/>Because the quantity of oxygen in Lake Vostok exceeds anywhere on our planet by 10-20X. Scientists predicted they would find new species that evolved far differently than any seen before.<br/><br/>After the initial research was completed a conspiracy theory propagated online. One of the Russian scientists defected. He claimed a highly intelligent creature, a new organism, engaged with them and killed some team members. This is where our Vostok story begins.<br/><br/>After a distress signal was received an unprecedented storm cut all contact with Vostok Station. As the storm raged on without any signs of letting up, multiple recon teams were sent. Your team is the only one to make it. After crashing 10 clicks away, you arrive at the aftermath of a massacre. Early into the reconnaissance you realize the story of the station goes much deeper.<br/><br/>The game is based on a First Strike Combat System. Players must battle physically and meta physically. Players also learn to control insanity and weaponize it.<br/><br/>An AI is provided to assist your team to off-set the intelligence of the new organism. The AI assists in many ways including scientific, weapon and ammunition recipes.<br/><br/>There are several player characters to choose from with varying capabilities. Players are free to assemble the kind of team they prefer.<br/><br/>Your team must fully explore the Russian station, re-establish communications, report back on the status and insure the chamber to the lake is sealed. Your team wins if they can make it the chamber and confirm it is sealed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Fire hoses and axes are not going to stop a monster, let the national guard handle that! Focus on putting out the fire in this high rise office building, chaps! Up the stairs, no power, keep those people safe!<br/><br/>In Towering Inferno, Roll and Write Revolution goes 3D!

The fire fighter has to enter the building then progress upward as they follow the path to save rooms and control the fire as it burns. The fire will burn downward or to the left or right ignoring paths, but avoiding rooms that have already been secured.<br/><br/>Players can also utilize the special powers of each side of the building they are on to help them move up or laterally. Clever play in this game finds the players having to plan for their moves but also plan for where the fire might go.<br/><br/>Can you secure the fire before the entire structure becomes a Towering Inferno?

Sometimes employees decide to leave the ranks of the team themselves.

After acquiring them players invest in graduates' development by paying for their training and marking the progress on their player boards. Once the players developed teams of employees matching the requirements of laid out contracts, they can fulfill contract cards and earn rewards (points, money or further employee development). At the end of every round some employees leave the teams and replacements will need to be found in consecutive rounds.<br/><br/>Main sources of points are:<br/>- contract cards (about 55% of points)<br/>- bonus cards (about 15%)<br/>- end-game bonuses (about 20%)<br/>- dividend (about 10%)<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

In order to do that they have to help some peculiar locals with their tiny little problems while looking for the magic snowglobe as well, which will be able to send them home when they finally reach the Christmas tree. The players start their journey in front of a snowman's hut, where the adventure begins, exploring objects and mysterious piles of snow, finding useful tools, and winding up in all kinds of challenging situations. Meanwhile, it is snowing continuously, which sometimes might be helpful, but other times it blocks their way. As time goes by, the weather gets drearier and drearier, fog and immense snowdrifts could close off the players' paths. Time passes differently in this unusual world, too. Ten minutes here is a whole day in the real world, so they must hurry with their mission to get home by Christmas Eve. At least that's what the snowman in the hut said, and I really hope he was right.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game of dice collecting and strategy<br/><br/>SET UP<br/>Dice must be placed one by one on the 12 available squares of the first half of the board (the first 3 columns).<br/>Then the players dispute the die who starts the game. Whoever is first has the right to choose the exit point before others, but whoever makes the first move is the player who came in second and so on.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>On their turn, each player may move along the paths in 2 different ways:<br/>1) Along the asphalt streets (gray): they may move 1 square at a time, ahead or to the sides.<br/>2) Along the fast bike lanes (brown): 2 squares at a time, ahead or to the sides.<br/>Each player may make their move and collect the die at the door with a number equal to the die in the center.<br/>In this case, the Player has reached door #3 of the green house and may collect the die with number 3.<br/><br/>CHOOSING THE DICE<br/>You must choose and collect dice, trying to pick up those which will provide the best total, and find the best trajectory to take them to their destination.<br/>Choices must take into consideration the number and color of the dice, which grants special features to each of their number:<br/>- Blue - Increase the number on the die by 1 (+1);<br/>- Red - Reduce the number on the die by 1 (-1);<br/>- Green - Allows an extra move (&gt;1);<br/>- Orange - Double the number of the next die to be picked up (x 2).<br/>Dice that are collected go to each player's marker on the TALLY CHART.<br/><br/>END OF THE FIRST STAGE<br/>When a player reaches any position of the 4th column - where there is a traffic light in the middle of the game board - the first stage of the game ends.<br/>All the dice to the left of that column are removed and rolled again, completing the 12 squares of the second stage, from the 5th to the 8th column.<br/>Players keep their current position and game resumes with the next player after the one who first reached the middle of the game.<br/><br/>IMPORTANT DETAILS<br/>Picking up 2 dice<br/>In some cases, a player's movement will allow them to pick up 2 dice (or more):<br/>- When they pick up a green die and make an extra move, they may pick up a second die;<br/>- If they reach a square in which both door numbers allow them to pick up both dice;<br/>- On the fast lane, if they move 2 squares and pass by doors with the same numbers of the dice, they may pick up both.<br/>Extra movement<br/>Picking up 2 green dice only allows for 1 extra move. On the fast lane, picking up a green die also provides an extra move (i.e., a third move).<br/>Changing direction<br/>If a player wants to change direction during the game, they may spend one action/movement to make that inversion.<br/>Doubled dice<br/>The player who picked up an orange die will pick that one with its normal value and double the next die - even if that just happens on the next round. The die with doubled value will go to the gray area of dice tally.<br/>Blocking<br/>A player may not occupy the same square as another player. To move, they must go in a different direction. A player may also choose not to move.<br/>Movement from the brown lane to the gray lane<br/>When leaving the brown lane to the gray lane, a player doesn't lose the second movement. It may be performed in the gray area. To have a second movement in the brown area, the first movement must be in that lane as well.<br/><br/>ENDING THE GAME<br/>To end a game, each player must have picked up at least 1 die of each color.<br/>When a player reaches one of the arrival points, the game ends, and the other players may still play their last turn.<br/>Besides the scoring from the dice, some Bonuses* may also be acquired by players:<br/>- First in Stage 1 (+2 points);<br/>- First in the Final Stage (+2 points);<br/>- Player with the most dice (+3 points).<br/><br/>The total sum of dice and bonuses determines the winner. If they are tied, the winner is the player who collected the most dice.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A slightly new take on variable strength chits (more granular with up to 5 steps per unit vs. the usual three) covering more obscure battles of the Eastern Front. This is the first entry in a three part simulation of the failed Soviet offensive to eliminate the salient of the German Ninth Army during the winter of 1942-43 known as Operation Mars (25 Nov - 12 Dec 1942). Players will conduct operations as either Soviet Direction Commander Zhukov or the German commander of the Ninth Army, Model. Several possibilities existed given the terrain and the weather situation and some of these will be possible to explore with this game. Included are some hypothetical options that could have altered the outcome. This work is primarily based on Zhukov's Greatest Defeat by David Glantz with some OOB fleshing by Nafziger and maps based on post-war USGS surveys (which were themselves taken from wartime Soviet surveys).<br/><br/>Each volume has one 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet (using 20mm hexes to be less cramped) with all three volumes able to link together covering 43&quot; x 48&quot; total area at 1.5 miles/hex and one day per turn.<br/>Each game uses 0.6&quot; counters of mainly German battalions and Soviet regiments or brigades - the first volume (Belyy) has 352 counters with two double-sided and three single-sided PAC accompanying a 18 page rule book, the second volume (Olenino) has 440 counters with three double-sided and two single-sided PAC accompanying a 20 page rule book, and the final volume (Konev) will have 528 counters with three double-sided and three single-sided PAC accompanying a 20 page rule book.<br/><br/>Included scenario:<br/>Belyy - Volume I - #1 Belyy Thrust - The included scenario provides the players a look at the attacks of Soviet 41st Army which managed the best gains of the operation. The goal of this scenario is to present players with a fluid breakthrough and timely reinforcements. Both sides hoping their command decisions will carry the day.

The game is played in several rounds with successively longer words.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>54 2-inch two-sided square cards. One side has letters, the back side has attributes. A timer from a mobile device is required.<br/><br/>GOAL:<br/>Get the most points by cobbling together letters into words.<br/><br/>INITIAL SETUP:<br/>Shuffle the deck and deal three letter cards face up to each player. Flip over three attribute cards.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>Players play simultaneously. Each player rotates their cards and melds them together to form a word. The letters of the word must come from adjacent cards, but not all cards need to be used. Words that match an attribute score +1 bonus for each matching attribute. The first player to call out a word and their score starts a one-minute timer. At the end of one minute, each player calls out their word and score. The player with the lowest score can risk one attempt to better their score. However, that player must be able to beat the highest score else they score zero. That player has one minute for the attempt.<br/><br/>Each score is recorded at the end of the round.<br/><br/>Players now decide if they collectively want to increase the number of cards dealt in the next round. Game play continues after shuffling and dealing the next sets of cards as per SETUP above (maybe with more cards).<br/><br/>After the final round of five cards, the player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>ATTRIBUTES:<br/>There are many attributes for bonus points. <br/>For example, is a food, ends in X, has two vowels.<br/>Although players can make any word, they should strive to make words that match one or more attributes to get the bonus points.<br/><br/>SOLO PLAY:<br/>Deal five cards and three attribute cards. Try to make successively longer words with higher and higher points. Record your best score. Repeat to attempt an even higher score.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The first player to convert their victim and the exorcists into Demoniacs wins.<br/><br/>Each player has a victim with mind and body strengths. Demon cards are played from your hand to torment your victims mind and body with precision. Once a victim is properly tormented, a dice roll determines whether they become fully possessed.<br/><br/>Players must watch out for the exorcist, who gets a chance every turn to use their holy power to disrupt players. &quot;Divinity&quot; cards are revealed each turn which change the rules of the game and can set players back considerably. Players can use &quot;Disturbance&quot; cards to cancel them out and keep their diabolical plans moving forward.<br/><br/>The first player to possess their victim and then attack the exorcist with a horde of matching demons wins the game. Can you conquer goodness and be the first to snatch souls? Choose your victim and get possessing!<br/><br/>",

Wildly slashing, hacking and stabbing with their dirt-encrusted blades, they spread disease and foetidness wherever they fight, infecting with every blow and gnawing at foes with their rotting - yet still formidable - fangs.<br/><br/>This multi-part plastic kit gives you everything needed to build a chittering horde of twenty Plague Monks, with the option of arming them with a pair of Foetid Blades or a Foetid Blade and Woe-stave. One model can be built as a Bringer-of-the-Word - he clutches either a Plague Scroll or Book of Woe. A model can be assembled as an Icon Bearer with either a Contagion Banner or Icon of Pestilence, and a model may be assembled as a Plague Harbinger, carrying either a Doom Gong or a dreaded Bale-chime.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gatefall is a strategic miniatures game of tactics, deck building, and resource management.<br/><br/>In the game, a rift has opened between worlds, causing a war between very different kinds of characters.<br/>The base game mode is designed for two players to fight head-to-head. Arena mode lets 2-8 players fight one another in a battle royale setting.<br/>In a two player game, players choose which team to control, the fantasy team consisting of Brog, Gildri, and Randar, or the Wasteland team consisting of Exile, Firebug, Penny, and Lost Boy. <br/>At the beginning of the game, each player has the same deck of ten cards, which contain seven &ldquo;1&rdquo; cards and three &ldquo;0&rdquo;cards. The first player draws five cards, and adds the total of their values. That number represents the number of actions the player can use for their team. Actions can be moving one space or attacking. These actions can be spread across the entire team, or used by only one character, depending on a character&rsquo;s traits. <br/>During an attack, the attacking player rolls the number of dice equivalent to the attacking character&rsquo;s attack stat. The defending player rolls the number of dice equal to the defending character&rsquo;s defense dice. The number of reds rolled are added up, and the defender takes damage equal to the number of reds the attacking character rolls above the total of their defending roll.<br/>Each player then adds up the number of green dice they rolled, and earns one coin for each green die.<br/>coins are saved up and used to buy new weapons from the weapon marketplace, to destroy &ldquo;zero&rdquo; cards in their hands, to purchase better cards from the main deck, or upgrade their individual character stats.<br/>Each character has an upgrade shop. Players can choose any of the available stats to upgrade in any order for any of their characters, and spend the appropriate amount of tokens to get those upgrades. When a character is fully upgraded, that character unlocks their special power, which is unique for each character.<br/>When a character is killed, the player who killed that character earns the number of victory points printed on the character&rsquo;s upgrade shop card, and the player whose character was killed draws a &ldquo;zero&rdquo; card from the &ldquo;zeroes&rdquo; pile for every victory point listed on the killed character&rsquo;s upgrade shop card and adds it to their discard pile. The killed character respawns in their base immediately, but that character cannot move or attack on their next turn, and effectively loses a turn while respawning. <br/>The first player to reach ten victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There has never been a more wacky, back and forth trading situation than with crypto, especially now.<br/><br/>Hodl It is played in a group of 3-8 players, where there are up to 8 different coin cards in play for everyone to collect within a round. These coin cards come in sets, and in order to win the game, a player must endeavour to collect all of one set. They can however, also utilise wildcards mixed into the deck which can have a positive, or a negative effect.<br/><br/>As the round progresses, players are trading 1, 2, 3 or more cards at a time. These trades are likely made up of coin cards but can include wildcards that the player doesn't want in their hand by the end. In turn, they are aiming to collect the cards they need from other players from that trade, so effectively it is fastest person first providing they aren't blindly competing for the same coin card. The round ends as soon as one player has a full winning set in hand and claims 'HOLD IT'!<br/><br/>The round can be played in as little as 5 minutes, depending on how volatile you make your trades, providing they follow some simple rules such as all the cards being traded, are of the same suit. As the rounds can be so short, this is a game of score and how well you can build that score up over several rounds, with each potential win in a round being of a varied score in itself.<br/><br/>The game is solely played with cards within one card deck.

Help the ducks.<br/><br/>Game-play involves several different sets of rules:<br/><br/>     Normal rules (similar to the &quot;Duck Duck Goose&quot; children's game) - Players throw down a card at a time until mousse appears. The first player to slap the mousse gets it and mousses one of their ducks. The first player to mousse all their ducks wins.<br/>     In Style rules (a sets game) - Players use the non-duck animal cards to search for sets of 3. One animal card is chosen as wild. First player to get 3 sets of 3 wins.<br/>     Blowout rules - Players divvy up all cards evenly, then play as fast as possible to get 5 ducks and 5 moose. A less-intense version involves stealing extra ducks or mousse left in the center discard pile, and the craziest version involves stealing directly from others as they uncover cards from their respective decks.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Kickstarter campaign begins July 11, 2023!<br/><br/>",

The 12 score cards are shuffled into a separate face up pile with only the top card visible. The winner of each trick (highest card) takes the top card from the score card pile.

During the trick-taking phase, players who play off-suit to a trick will take their cards back and they are placed into that player's hand for the next phase; the winner takes the remaining cards into their hand for the next phase. Some cards have special effects and the winner of each trick obtains a yellow cube.<br/><br/>If a player collected no cards for their millionaire hand, the game ends prematurely.  Otherwise, the players take their new hands and play a climbing game. The following possibilities are intricate, due to the game's card distribution and two-suit nature.<br/><br/>The game has a number of unique elements.  For instance:<br/><br/><br/>    The start player of each trick (for both halves) can choose the direction of play for each trick.<br/>    In the millionaire phase, players can only play a single card until &quot;energy bundles&quot; are created.  These go into a central pool and can be spent by any lead player to trigger a round of playing pairs, triple, etc.<br/><br/><br/>",

The scenarios have been carefully selected from among the hundreds of actual battles from 1739 to 1815 to provide a set of interesting small actions; the first six can be played by no more than 4 players, while the 7th requires a minimum of 5. This selection was done deliberately to serve the very large percentage of wargamers who live in communities with only small gaming groups (perhaps as few as a half-dozen players or so). It has the added benefit of also serving new players and those who simply prefer smaller battles. Other key factors include: (a) an emphasis on balanced battles where victory is usually determined simply by victory points, rather than by special victory rules; (b) a selection of different types of battles, from frigate-vs-frigate actions to Ship-of-the-Line [SOL] squadron actions to combinations of both types; and (c) all ship logs for all seven scenarios have been completely pre-filled to allow you to play them all immediately, without having to fill them out yourself.<br/><br/>",

Winning the game depends on the use of various moves and tactical moves. There is also an element of randomness in the game, such as throwing dice, cards drawn and then resolved.<br/>Players take on the role of coaches of teams of 15 players (11 quarterback players and 4 reserve football players). Each trainer will be represented by a unique trainer card, which, thanks to his skills, will influence the course of the game.<br/>The main inspiration behind the creation of this game is that there are very few board soccer simulations available. Thanks to this game, every young person who loves football can sit at the table, feel like a team coach and lead them to victories. Become a coach, learn the secrets of football and have fun fully making decisions affecting the course of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If the word is worth 12 points or more, the player will receive an action card for their next turn. If their word is seven letters long or more, they will receive a combo card to keep in addition to the ten cards in their hand.<br/><br/>From then on, each player can either make a word of their own or choose to steal another player's word by adding onto it. If they can't play, they can choose to use their turn to replace as many letters as they desire. The catch is that their discarded letters will go into the center of the table face up for anyone to use at any time! If your word hasn't been stolen by your next turn, then you add the points to your score and set the letters aside to be shuffled back into the deck.<br/><br/>If you have an action card you'd like to play, you can do so at the beginning of your turn, to either help yourself or stab your friends in the back! There are four levels of action cards depending on how interesting of a game you want to play, ranging from cards like &quot;Skip 1 Turn&quot; on Level One to &quot;Divide Your Score By 2 If You Don't Play A 14 Point Word On Your Next Turn&quot; on Level Four.<br/><br/>Combo cards feature some of the most common letter combinations in the English language, and are worth a significant amount of points if you manage to use them in a word!<br/><br/>-from the Kickstarter page<br/><br/>",

Gruntas will cheerfully and greedily eat anything, including iron (the result of devouring people wearing it, more often than not.)

The orruks can be armed with pig-iron choppas, or jagged gore-hackas, with an optional Gore-grunta boss featuring his own head, weapon and grunta options. 100 components in total, with three Citadel 90x52mm Oval bases.<br/><br/>",

But for some Megabosses, this isn&rsquo;t enough! These particularly angry orruks seek out and subdue enormous Maw-krushas (often by yelling really, really loudly at them) &ndash; ill-tempered and powerful creatures who enjoy smashing stuff up almost as much as the orruks themselves. This uneasy pairing never really gets along especially well, and the Megaboss needs to constantly remind his Maw-krusha who&rsquo;s in charge with the liberal application of an iron boot to the back of the head. Despite this, almost nothing on the battlefield can withstand their noisy rampage, and the immense number of kills they rack up inspires nearby orruks to fight ever harder.<br/><br/>This multi-part plastic kit contains all the components necessary to assemble one Megaboss on Maw-krusha. Standing atop his fierce steed, the Megaboss is armed with either a boss gore-hacka and scrap-tooth or a choppa and rip-tooth fist &ndash; both options are suitably killsome. The Maw-krusha features an alternative mask and bladed tail. This kit contains 63 components, includes a Citadel 160mm Round base, and can be optionally assembled as Gordrakk, the Fist of Gork.<br/><br/>",

Players represent the Welsh national movement, the left or socialist movement, or British unionism.  The Liberal Party is represented as a 'non-human player' who any player can choose to play as, instead of as themselves, during their turn.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to place all pieces held in a player's hand onto the board, with the pieces representing bases on key locations in Wales.<br/><br/>Play is turn-based, with fixed and visible movement abilities and options (which include base-building, grid movement and rail movement), and no chance mechanisms at all. There is no player elimination.  As well as outright victory, two types of draws can end the game - one with all the human players losing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The supportive website makes the game easy to learn and offers free replacement downloadable scoresheets and a little of the game's early manufacturing history.<br/><br/>This game&rsquo;s rule action is so true to baseball, in that it starts out easy, with a lot of table laughter. As the innings go buy, it grows into a naturally competitive and strategic challenge. All players will be standing in the ninth inning, on every card flipped. There are bunts to first, stealing a base, picking off another runner, stealing home and yes, you can be thrown out at the plate. Dealing is crucial in this game, where the dealer scores on the flop.

You are on the shipwrecked crew which finds itself castaway, bedraggled, and needing a strong leader.<br/><br/>On your turn, you'll choose between adding crew of varying value to one of two challenges, or else attempting to perform a challenge with the crew already attached. When you add a crew member to a challenge, you may play them face-up (to achieve the challenge effect), or face-down (keeping their value a secret). If all the crew members on a challenge meet the required challenge value, you succeed in the challenge and collect its points. If not, your opponent gets the respect points instead. First player to 6 points wins!<br/><br/>",

The winner is the player with the most points at the end.<br/><br/>This is a symbol-matching game similar to others, but different in that it uses cross-shaped pieces instead of dominoes, triangles, or hexagons.<br/><br/>",

The theme is that there is a Kingdom of Seasons that controls the seasons, but mischievous fairies threaten to disrupt them. One player (and an helper) will play as the Kingdom of Seasons and the rest as the mischievous fairies.<br/><br/>You go around bidding to decide the Princess of Seasons player. You bid the number of Picture Cards you will take (Maximum of 18) and name the Trump Season, this effects the hierarchy of rank. If Spring (3, 4, and 5) are chosen, the ranking of number cards is 5&gt;4&gt;3&gt;2&gt;1&gt;12&gt;...&gt;8&gt;7&gt;6. Once the princess has been decided, they name a specific card and the player that possesses that card joins the Princess team secretly (it is possible to name a card you have or in the kitty so as to be alone).<br/><br/>Then a may-follow trick taking hand occurs. If the princess team meets or exceeds their bet of acquired cards, they win and points are tallied. There are 4 fairy cards that beat all number cards,1 princess card that forces fairy cards to be played (and wins a hand), and a mischievous fairy card that removes a card from play.<br/><br/>",

The Cobbit race has no future unless they can defeat Daidara.<br/><br/>The players take on the roles of leaders of the Cobbit tribe. The mighty Daidara is difficult to defeat without the right preparation. Players develop the play area, creating tall trees, mountains, and towers. As they build the map, random footprints appear, triggering details about how the Daidara will move and its special abilities. When the fourth footprint is drawn, the Daidara appears and Cobbits can be killed permanently and removed from the game. Players must use proper preparation, available items, and teamwork to defeat Daidara before they're all destroyed.<br/><br/>The game can be played solo or with multiple people controlling the 4 Cobbits. Daidara moves on its own with random movements determined by which tiles are drawn in a particular game. For replaybility, five different Daidaras are available, each with unique special attacks.<br/><br/>",

All 54 cards have unique and mesmerizing hand-drawn art to stare at as you play through this tactical game.<br/><br/>In the first half, the Build Phase, you collect cards from a tableau to crate a 12-card hand, scoring for the number of duplicate numbers and runs you have.<br/><br/>The second half, the Release Phase, has you shedding your hand by playing sets of runs and same numbers. It adopts a trick-taking structure where after all players have played a card or passed, the winner takes all the cards as points. When a player sheds out, all remaining players remove a random card from their hand as negative points. The game continues until only 1 player remains, then scores are tallied and the winner declared.<br/><br/>",

Players need to efficiently use their resources and cleverly utilise their units to plan and react to their opponent&rsquo;s move to destroy their enemies.<br/><br/>During your turn, you collect resources depending on how you distributed your workers in your previous turn. So thinking ahead is very important in this game. These resources help you build up a strong army that you can use to attack other players with the help of the action cards.<br/><br/>An attack on another player not only damages their army but also their workers. Once a player has no more workers, they are eliminated from the game. The game ends when a player either collects all ROAR cards or eliminates all other players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Backwards Game is a party game played in teams in which all of the questions and challenges are incredibly easy...if you do them forwards. However, in this game, EVERYTHING happens in reverse.<br/><br/>At the start of a game, each team decides on a secret five letter word, e.g., B-R-E-A-D, which they write backwards on their &quot;backwards board&quot; and cover up with five mystery cards. Each team has thirty seconds to whizz through as many backwards clues as possible across five types of clue card. After thirty seconds, the team scores how many correct answers they got by ticking them off inside the circles on the backwards board. When a team ticks off three of the circles, they can try to guess a letter on the rival team's backwards board. If the letter they guess is in the other team's word, that team must reveal it by removing the mystery card.<br/><br/>The first team to correctly guess the rival's team secret word and say it forwards wins. However, if they make an incorrect guess, the opposing team can remove any mystery card from their opponent's backwards board...<br/><br/>",

They carried people and goods from one lakeside port to another. Two big companies owned the boats. They competed with each other to provide the fastest service and do the most business. The competition wasn't always friendly: sometimes lawsuits and collisions were involved. But the steamboats themselves were glorious machines and helped lakeside communities flourish.<br/><br/>Steamboat Races is a simple two-player postcard game for all ages. Each player takes on the role of a steamboat captain (either blue or red). Your goal is to be the first steamboat to circumnavigate Keuka Lake.

Transform the force of technological innovation into sparks of progress. Social, technological and cultural revolutions provide the perfect playground for your alternate history fantasies.<br/><br/>The muscle of industry is powered by the sinews of trade. Import necessary goods to keep your people happy and fuel the factories that will produce valuable items for export. Harness the power of steam and coal to transform factory towns into industrial titans.<br/><br/>Rather than painting the map of the world, you write the book of your nation. But you are an actor on a global stage, racing your opponents up the mountain of prestige. In Victoria, the choice is yours, play tall or play wide. While some players will focus on internal politics, developing their state's infrastructure and institutions, others will use high-stakes diplomatic plays, involving pacts, alliances, threats and bluffs, to get their way on the stage of international politics and claim their place in the sun. As a last resort, such dangerous plays will sometimes inevitably result in war.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

However, those players can pull on the red string as a way to communicate to the remaining investigators.<br/><br/>Once the remaining investigators think they know where the hand is, they can announce it. The investigators carefully set down the red string and each remaining player has once chance to reveal the card.<br/><br/>",

He then hands the envelope with the money to his neighbour on his left. It is important that this amount must be strictly higher than the amount given at the beginning.

Rather than creating a nest and incubating its eggs, it prefers to observ the nests of other birds. As soon as the parents leave the nest, the cuckoo lays an egg instead of another. The birds do not realise that they are incubating an egg that is not their own.<br/><br/>You take turns playing the role of a cuckoo and aiming at another player. This player will present his hand of cards to the blind and the cuckoo will try to target an egg. . The targeted player will have to defend against the cuckoo and prevent it from laying an egg containing a baby cuckoo in its nest.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players collect baby birds and other cards that the other players place on their nest. No one knows exactly what they have in their nest.<br/>At the end of the game, all the eggs in the nest hatch.<br/>Whoever has the most chicks and the least baby cuckoos in their nest wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Defeat the Threat! provides an exciting, fully solitaire and multi-player board game experience.  At the game's core is a patented assembly that simulates a global attack by a mysterious alien Threat.  The patented assembly is a multi-level 3D structure that simulates sending player's Gunships up into the atmosphere to defend Earth.  One or more players advance R&amp;D, defend cities, and maintain a World Treaty to Defeat the Threat!  The game includes the patented board game assembly, magnifying glass, reference cards, dice, and playing pieces.<br/><br/>During each round of play, which represents a defensive action against an attack launched by the Threat, players advance R&amp;D to strengthen armament and altitude capacity of their Gunship Fleets defending their respective City Regions.  The combination of a Gunship Fleet&rsquo;s Armament and Altitude for a given player yields a defensive value which, when equal to or greater than the Threat attack value provided by the patented Assembly, results in a successful defense of a given City Region defended by that Gunship Fleet.  Because the Threat Attack values increase throughout the Threat&rsquo;s campaign, each player serving as a Gunship Fleet Commander must steadily advance R&amp;D to maintain the successful defense of protected City Regions.  The goal is to successfully defend as many City Regions as possible for the entire duration of the Threat Campaign, which lasts on average about 8-9 rounds, but can be shorter or longer.  In addition to operational decisions made during the Threat Campaign, players must also constantly reconsider the strategic impact of remaining in, or leaving, the Treaty.  For example, remaining in or leaving the Treaty affects the availability of the Command Reserve and the cost of R&amp;D advances, either of which may make the difference between saving or losing City Regions under particularly intense assaults by the Threat.  The Latest Intelligence Board provides vital intelligence that players can consider in planning their strategies.  During each round of play, players receive resources, cooperate to advance R&amp;D, identify a Threat attack, decide whether to exit the Treaty, and defend against the Threat attack.<br/><br/>The game ends when Week 30 is reached based on operation of the Assembly per the Assembly Instruction Board (e.g., adding the rolled 6-sided die value to the existing week results in 30 or more).  In any case, the last Threat Attack of the last round is resolved with the Yellow Pointer at the week &ldquo;30&rdquo; number on the board base.<br/><br/>If desired, Gunship Fleet Commanders may evaluate their performance by summing performance points listed below and checking the Performance Level listed below.

        "description": "Bhargage plays similarly to Five-card Cribbage, with cards of the Extended Decktet instead of regular cards. The linear deck of Cribbage is substituted by the fluid, interwoven deck of Bhargage. The Decktet cards and scoring combinations give Bhargage an entirely different flavor. Frequently, Bhargage presents interesting decisions that are quite alien to Cribbage thinking.<br/><br/>Sets of 2 or more cards of the same value score points, as in Cribbage. Players score for cards totaling 11, not 15, and the play of the cards is up to 23, not 31. Sequences don't score in Bhargage, but Bhargage uses the bharg combination, which is common to other Decktet games&mdash;a bharg is a set of cards containing each of the six suits exactly once.<br/><br/>The Pawns, Courts, and Excuse of the Extended Decktet are zero-valued cards in Bhargage, and can multiply the counts for 11 in the scoring. The Excuse also has no suit and can likewise multiply the score for bhargs. Lastly, players score for &quot;shortage,&quot; for the number of suits not present in the opponent's hand. Bhargage is played up to 111, not 121.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Offensive le Jeu is a simple and effective educational tool to explain military operations up to the brigade level. It is particularly interesting for officer or student training. Generic in nature, it allows a wide range of player-generated scenarios, can be played on a 1:50'000 military map and can be easily house-ruled.<br/><br/>Each side starts with a set of forces and special units, as well as a hand of event and asset cards. The scale of the units' movement on the square grid is realistic, as well as their spotting range and firepower. The games teaches combined arms on the higher tactical level, while allowing for a skillful combination of obstacles, mines, demonstrations and paramilitary groups - the game conveys the idea of a hybrid engagement.<br/><br/>The use of blocks and the combination with event &amp; asset cards allows for good bluffing strategies. Combat is very simple but introduces unit-specific terrain modifiers which work really well together. A lot of additional &quot;chrome&quot; is left out, but the system works and it is simple enough to be extended with logistical rules, command &amp; control, asymmetric forces, or new characteristics for units.<br/><br/>Victory can either be achieved by the destruction of enemy units or after agreeing to a specific scenario victory condition.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>As you may have understood, Offensive the game is not a game like the others! It was developed for instruction and then adapted for all audiences! So it has kept some characteristics that make the difference:<br/><br/><br/>      The possibility to play on all Swiss topographic maps at 1:50'000 scale.<br/>      Rules that adapt to the level of the players to accompany you on the path of knowledge and tactical understanding.<br/>      Simple rules so that you can get the hang of it quickly! <br/><br/><br/>Offensive the game is a board game that includes:<br/><br/>      A basic game board;<br/>      66 units to command;<br/>      Offensive cards to influence the battle;<br/>      2 dice to play the confrontations;<br/>      2 types of rules according to your level of play (Novice or expert) which are downloadable on the page of the Internet site.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (Translated)<br/><br/>Vous l'aurez sans doute compris, Offensive le jeu n'est pas un jeu comme les autres!

        "description": "SHOOT-A-LOOP is a marble-shooting, point-scoring, dexterity game for any number of players. There are many ways to play, but all involve loading a marble or marbles onto the loop-track and launching them into scoring positions by pulling back and releasing a spring.<br/><br/>Original box included:<br/>Tin loop-track with integrated scoring tray and launch spring<br/>6 glass marbles in different colors<br/>Packing slip<br/>Instructions printed on box<br/><br/>The box reads:<br/><br/>DIRECTIONS FOR PLAYING No. 59 SHOOT-A-LOOP<br/><br/>Place all marbles in the track at the lowest point. The marbles are propelled forward by pulling button found on the end of flat spring, away from the upright and allowing it to spring back with a snap. After doing this a few times, the player can judge what force is necessary to shoot the marbles into the scoring tray. Scores are plainly marked beside each hole in the tray.<br/><br/>In most cases, players will have their own ideas about method of play and scoring, but we find the following to game very interesting. Players will have to use their own ideas in deciding who is to play first, second, etc. One player continues to shoot until all marbles are in the scoring tray. The total score for this player is then taken and the next player takes his turn. This continues until one of the players has accumulated a total count of one thousand or over. He or she is the winner.<br/><br/>MADE BY<br/>WOLVERINE SUPPLY &amp; MFG. CO.<br/>N. S. PITTSBURGH, PA.<br/><br/>",

Without further thought the merciless Brute uses the strength of their four arms to charge right into a mob of out-of-control robots to create a path for the Runner to strike the huge Alien. But the Alien only gets into a raging fit and spits toxic poison on the Runner&rsquo;s arm. The Medic quickly and efficiently comes to their aid and does everything in their power to save them. One of the robots is about to shoot the Medic but the Hacker intervenes, hijacking the robot&rsquo;s firewall. Finally the Drone pilot finishes off the mob with heavy artillery robots. Only the giant Alien still stands and charges at the pilot with its powerful claws. The mental attack of the psychic stops the Alien in its tracks, trapping the Alien&rsquo;s mind in agony. Another mission is accomplished when the last gunshot stops Alien&rsquo;s screaming. The Runner nods off to the Medic as they return with the Alien&rsquo;s head in their grasp. What might their employee have in mind with such an obnoxious trophy one might wonder but mercenaries ask no questions.<br/><br/>Cyberrun dives right into the sci-fi experience offering six unique starting classes and offers solo-mode and co-op gameplay for up to four players. Players find new augments and upgrades to optimize and customize characters which can be found after accomplishing missions in turn-based strategy combat style. The mercenaries have to defeat a wide variety of Alien swarms, hordes of robots and hostile human factions using mob action mechanics tracked via app on the cellphone. If players use their items strategically they can cancel the opponents&rsquo; move before their turn. The party shares a single health pool, ensuring an exciting adventure for the whole party until the end of an encounter.<br/><br/>Cyberrun&rsquo;s gameplay is designed to combine the cooperative, exciting sci-fi experience with the fun of rolling a dice console in the shape of a traditional D6 -  the unidice. Players choose up to six different item options they can roll during their turn using the unidice like a dice gaming controller and cellphone serves as a display. Mercenaries use Action Points to roll/reroll or use the rolled gear.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But if your cooking is off too much thanks to your opponents' sabotaging, you won't be rewarded as much (or maybe even take a penalty). Players tally their earnings and losses at the end to see if anyone made it through the kitchen sabotage with edible food.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "... God created the Heavens and gave it to the Angels. The Angels live in the Silver City. The Angel Lucifer took issue with God over giving Earth to the humans, and he was exiled from the Silver City. Many, known now as the The Fallen, that agreed with Lucifer, left with him, and the Red City was born. Lucifer schemes to take the Silver City. Now war is on the horizon. The Faithful Angels look to stop the Fallen roaming the Heavenly Realms. These are the Heralds of War.<br/><br/>Welcome to Angels: Heralds of War, a rules-lite skirmish-level war game for 2 players, but a solo mode is also available. This game uses the ZipWarz game system. In the game, one player plays as the Fallen Angels, while the other player plays as the Faithful Angels. Each side has their own goals they are looking to achieve on the battlefield. Each goal earns them Victory Points. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the 4th round wins the game.<br/><br/>It's a PnP game where you can use your available minis, tokens and dice with the PnP material provided. Included with Angels: Heralds of War are 8 unique armies ready to battle. Each one has special powers and unique Victory Point goals to reach during the game. Each one has a leader and some followers.<br/><br/>Each player has their army and moves their units on the 4x6 battlefield grid. They choose 1-3 units to take 2 actions each round, alternating players after each unit until all units are done. When in the same zone on the grid the units can attack and try to defeat the opponent's units to earn Victory Points.<br/><br/>",

Each economic quarter, the companies will hire experts, pick up contracts, and decide on advertising expenditure (that will shape the potential market share) and the amount of product to be produced. The demand, which is uncertain and affected by the outcome of random events, needs to be fulfilled from the current quarter's production but also excess production from previous quarters (inventory), converting potential market share into actual market share. Unfulfilled demand and unfulfilled contacts will lead to reduction of the company&rsquo;s share value.<br/><br/>The game is played over 8 rounds (8 quarters or 2 years). At the end of the 8th round, each company owner sums up the wealth accumulated during the game (company cash, shares, value of inventory stock). The winner is the player with the most total wealth. However, an early finish is possible. The game may end before the end of the 8th round if one of the two companies has dominated the market or if a company goes bankrupt.<br/><br/>",

He notes the number of moves drawn and the number of penalties for each player.

If a player gets it wrong, he pays a token into the till and the next player must now indicate the correct place, etc. If the answer is correct, the player receives a token from the till. If someone violates the same sign the second time, he pays 2 tokens, the third time 3 tokens, etc.<br/>Each player places his figure on his starting space S in the color of his own vehicle (car, truck, racing car or motorbike). Each player has to get to his destination Z (which again has the color of the vehicle). He is free to choose his path. <br/>All players always make a move one after the other. The streets are divided into equal spaces. Each space means one turn at a driving speed of 30 km/h. This is the initial speed for each vehicle. On the second move the vehicle may go to the next higher speed of 60 km/h. Each vehicle may increases its speed by a further 30 km each time it moves up to its specified maximum speed (truck 60km/h, motorbike 90 km/h, car 120 km/h, racing car  150 kn/h). This rule is interrupted immediately if the vehicle comes to a road obstacle, which is indicated by a traffic sign. Such a sign forces the player to drive more slowly or even to stop or turn around.<br/><br/>Whoever gets to their goal Z in the shortest time - i.e. with the fewest moves - and with the fewest penalty points and the most money is the winner. If two players arrive at the same time, the number of penalty points and the money decides. The winner receives half the till as a prize. Only the driver who gets to his destination in 35 moves without making any mistakes, becomes the champion driver. He wins the title and in this case the whole till.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to make $10,000 before the Cubicle Troll (an NPC with a regular paycheck) and before all the other players.<br/><br/>The game can be played by 2-6 players and takes between 1-2 hours.<br/><br/>Each round consists of four phases: the Hustle phase, the Payday phase, the Restock phase, and the Event phase:<br/><br/>During the Hustle phase, players choose character cards and roll a die to either try to sell product to that character, or to recruit that character as a downline.<br/><br/>During the Payday phase, each player gets paid money according to the number and type of downlines they have - and the Cubicle Troll gets their paycheck.<br/><br/>Next comes to Restock phase, when all players must buy at least the minimum required inventory to maintain membership in their chosen MLM - don't worry, you can take out credit cards if you need to!<br/><br/>Finally, during the event phase, each player selects an event card that can either help or hurt their chances of success. Then it's time for a new round with another Hustle phase!<br/><br/>This game allows for some sabotage of other players by stealing or alienating their downlines, and all players have the opportunity to spend money to make money - just like a real pyramid scheme - I mean, multi-level marketing company!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Completion is a complete-the-quote Bible game with three suggested playstyles. The box even suggests using the game cards to put on a Church Pageant play.<br/><br/>The first playstyle involves one player reading the prompt cards aloud to a group of players. In this version, the player who correctly completes the Bible quote receives the card. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>The second playstyle involves one player reading the prompt cards and two teams of players competing much like a team spelling bee. The player reading the cards will read to one team, and that team will continue to be asked prompt cards until a teammate misses the answer. After giving an incorrect answer, that player drops out of play, and the reader begins reading to the other team. This continues until only one team remains or the cards are all read. The team with the most players remaining wins.<br/><br/>Another playstyle involves all the cards being distributed equally to players. Players go around clockwise asking the player to their left to finish the quote. If someone answers correctly, they receive the card. If someone fails to answer correctly, the asker is allowed to steal a card from them. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "オルターネオ (ALTER-NEO) is a card game from Japan, revised from an earlier game called Alter. The publisher notes the new game has better card production, which you cannot see through.<br/><br/>In this new game, the players try to affect the future of the round, and achieve bonus scores or an outright win. The game rules are for four players, with variants for two or three.<br/><br/>Each player gets a Pick card in their colour, and an aide showing the various Bonus point combinations they can win.<br/><br/>The game has a deck of 16 scoring cards numbered 0-3. Players will try to pick a score card each round, but risk being bumped on to the next card. A dealer is selected (the player who has recently altered the future). The dealer shuffles the draw deck, and turns up four cards so all can see. These are then shuffled and placed randomly face-down around the draw deck. The dealer placers their Pick card on one at random.<br/><br/>The players take turns going clockwise. They can either Watch - look at an uncovered card and if they wish, place their Pick on a card they have Watched - or they can Change - place their Pick on a covered card, which bumps that player's Pick onto the next card, and so on.<br/><br/>The player who goes last gets to Watch the remaining uncovered card if they want, and can place their Pick card there or choose to Change, and place on a covered card, and force the other Pick cards to move on.<br/><br/>Once the four Pick cards are down, the players collect their Score cards and Pick cards, and begin a new round by passing the Dealer to the next player.<br/><br/>Players try to accumulate four Score cards that will trigger various Bonus points at the game end. Players can check the value of their Score cards at any time.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted and all score cards collected, players total up the base points on their Score cards, and any Bonuses. For example, by collecting 0011, or 1111, a player gets 5 points.<br/><br/>If a player manages to get 0033, they automatically win. otherwise, most points wins.<br/><br/>The game was published in three different coloured plastic boxes, but the contents in each were the same.<br/><br/>English rules are available online.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

To do so, they must employ different strategies.<br/><br/>The game features an original card game system with three decks (military, civilian and diplomatic) that allows players to customize their style of play. The rules cover all the typical aspects of a 4x game: exploration, expansion, colonization, technological advances, diplomacy ... and include a solo game system that is also integrated into multiplayer games.<br/><br/>Although the mechanics are card-based, it has wargame elements and, above all, many ideas that make it unique not only in its genre. The rules for playing solo games are well integrated into the multiplayer scenarios. They are combined in a way that creates a lot of variability within the same scenario.<br/><br/>The scenario system is also elastic, even allowing players to design their own, set in their favorite Sci-Fi universes. This edition provides four solo scenarios (one of which is introductory), one two-player scenario, and a sixth 3 - 4 player scenario.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

I hope I piqued your interest and that you&rsquo;ll stick around!<br/><br/>&bull; How is it played?<br/>- Like most TTRPG games, you will need your character sheet that you will compile with the help of the source book where you will find all necessary information about the game mechanics and it will basically teach you how to play the game. Reading through, you will find out the various combat mechanics that are divided in chapters:<br/><br/>STATISTICS:<br/>- There is a list of statistics that you may invest points in and they all boost your character's strength, agility, dexterity, spirit and other. There are 9 statistics in total and some of them have various functions in order to keep the list small and compact.<br/><br/>COMBAT:<br/>- First thing first, you have to know that there are 4 types of damage and each benefits from a said &quot;Main&quot; statistic out of the 4 main ones. For example, there is Slicing Damage on a weapon, it means that your agility will serve as a damage multiplier for that kind of weapon. This will prevent that dexterous rogue to pickup a great sword out of the blue and use it as effectively as a fighter. There is no rule for what you can equip so you can let your imagination run wild with the actual 23 available subclasses, over 120 magical abilities and many many more to come, you can make your own unique character and set it free into the dark ages of mythical Transylvania. You will find a lot more in the source book about bleeding effects, wounds and how they can turn the tide of the combat, a progression chart where each level, your character is allowed x points that you can spend in increasing your statistic's value thus making your character stronger... There is a lot but, let's move on...<br/><br/>PROFESSIONS<br/><br/>Your character can learn professions that will allow them to gain access to certain consumables and more. Professions are meant to bring to the table unique interactions between players that can alter the course of the story drastically, from the Thaumaturgist rogue that can either create poisons or cure them, to the alchemist vedmak who can transmute certain weapon materials, these are all things that as you progress and level up, you will be able to unlock.<br/><br/>MAIN STORY<br/><br/>The game starts you off slowly, with your character not knowing about the existence of the supernatural and then slowly discovering of it's existence, you will find yourself in a situation where you've seen things and experienced but can't share them with other people freely as freedom of speech was not so common back then and being accused of witchcraft was quite common for even the most ridiculous things, a situation where you have to measure your words carefully and having to find a way to survive and make moral choices that will shape the world around you, in other words, you are the story, you make the world shift with your actions.<br/><br/>ENEMIES:<br/><br/>There are all sorts of monsters and beasts, some of them, are inspired off of mythical creatures from local folk stories that I grew up with as a child, like iele or moroi, pricolici and more, but, there are also simple creatures that you can find in the wilds, simple, but very dangerous sience the game tries to achieve a realistical combat feel, so, one can only imagine, if a simple wild animal is that strong, how strong can a werewolf be... or a vampire... Guess you'll find out soon. I just hope that whatever it is you decide to do while playing the game you're having fun!<br/><br/>",

The players select pairs of cards to win, but there are special effects on the cards and set winning conditions too. Of the five tricks played, highest value will win three, lowest will win won, and highest total wins the fifth. These are turned up randomly at the start of each of the five tricks.<br/><br/>The game has a deck of 25 cards numbered 1 to 5 in five colours. This shuffled and players are dealt a hand of 10 cards, plus a zero card. The remaining cards are used as victory points for each trick.<br/><br/>Each player gets an aide showing the different number combos that rank in the game. A combo of 1 and 5 in the same colour is the highest rank, then a run in the same colour, then any pair, then any two in the same colour, then any run, then any two.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, the winning condition and the scoring card are revealed. Players choose two cards to play face-down as their trick. The starting layer can choose to Open or pass. Opening means they force the opponent to reveal a number card, but the effect on that card takes place. If they passed, the opponent can Open or pass. After this, the cards are revealed and the trick resolved.<br/><br/>The winner takes the scoring cards as victory points and the game moves on to the next trick. After five tricks, the player with the most victory points is the winner.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The front of each card shows the alcohol value of that glass, the back shows the range in the set. So the pink cocktail goes 1,1,2,2,3,4,5 but the red cocktail set goes -2,0,2,4,6,8,10.<br/><br/>Players are dealt some cards face-down and do not look at their drinks. Instead, they select some to hold up in front of themselves, so the other players can see the values. Players then take turns to ask questions about their drinks, until the start player stops asking, after which everyone else gets one more question.<br/><br/>Players must deduce from what they see, and what they learn, which cards to drink and which to discard. They must drink under their limit, which is set by the hand cards they chose not to pick up.<br/><br/>If they finish under their limit, they score points equal to the number of cards held, so being able to drink more glasses but not get drunk scores most. If they go over their limit, they get zero. After player a few rounds, the player with the most points wins, being best at social drinking.<br/><br/>In addition, players may draw and discard during the round, and certain cards also have special effects that apply to the player or to the others.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Players are trying to play cards in sequence, but not to actually empty their hand.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player clears their hand, but they cannot win the game. Instead, the winner is the player with the lowest total value of cards still in hand.<br/><br/>In Japanese folklore, Akuma are malevolent demons that afflict humans. In the game, you are possessed by the demons. The game has a deck of cards numbered 0 to 9 (zero is treated as higher than 9), in six colours. The deck is shuffled, and players are dealt a hand (according to the number of players). Players take turns to play cards from their hand to the table in sequence.<br/><br/>A player can place a single card, or a pair of the same value, or a run of numbers in the same colour.<br/><br/>In addition, some cards have special effects, such as the 5 card reverses the direction of play.<br/><br/>When a player cannot play a card at all, the current tableau is discarded and a new one started. But that player must discard cards adding up to a value determined by the tableau.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players are trying to stay in the round playing cards to the table, but not emptying their hand, but also not keeping their hand value high. <br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

All you have to do is, ask yourself - &ldquo;What do I see?&rdquo;&nbsp;<br/><br/>Pixel can be played in a few variations. Players are expected to come up with a caption by looking at the pictures. This caption could be an object, a country, a person, a colour, or anything that can be connected to the picture. For example - there is a picture in which kids are playing in a beach. One could say - &ldquo;Sun, Water, Ocean, Atlantic, Barbados, Umbrella, Sand, Holiday, etc.&rdquo;. The caption/words can be in any language.<br/><br/>Variation 1 :- The objective of the game is to be the first one to spell a word using the pictures. Distribute 4 cards to each player. Each player should find a 3-letter word from one of the pictures and use the other 3 cards to spell it out. <br/>For a 4 letter word, distribute 5 cards (and so on&hellip;.). Shuffle and deal again. First one to complete is the winner.<br/><br/>Variation 2 :- Someone shouts a common word (e.g: CAT, LOVE, WATER, etc.). Distribute as many cards as the letters in the word to each player. Players have to spell out the word using the pictures. One picture per letter. <br/>For example - if the word was LOVE, one possible answer could be &ndash;&nbsp;Lemonade,&nbsp;Orange,&nbsp;Volcano and&nbsp;Exercise.<br/>First one to complete is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1861, the Southern states had seceded from the Union, attacked Federal positions and forts, and were preparing for a War of Independence. The North responded by building up its own army (prewar Union troops were approximately 20,000; the total number who fought at Bull Run alone.) The armies on both side would swell, so that at their peaks, the South would have close to 1.2 million and the North would have more than 2 million manpower in uniform. What it took to do this was incredible. Some of the factors were the draft, establishment of income taxes, and the further implementation of machines for manufacturing. The organization which took place North and South allowed the war to go as long as it did.<br/><br/>Now, become a &quot;Super-general&quot; in charge of 100,000 manpower, an area's production, moving supplies, moving manpower and material, building war materials, deciding how and when to blockade, or running blockades. Explore what it takes to defeat the Southern Rebellious Slime, or the Northern Yankee Imperialist Oppressor. Can you do it alone, or will you link your survival to that of the others on your side? Will you trade needed goods and units freely and not consider the fame others gain from your generosity, or will you decide to risk defeat so that you might do it all yourself?<br/><br/>Become one of the eight players: <br/>The General of the Army of the Potomac <br/>The General of the Army of The Ohio <br/>The General of the Army of the West <br/>The Admiral of the Navy, for the North <br/>The General of the Army of Virginia <br/>The General of the Army of Texas <br/>The General of the Army of Tennessee <br/>The General of the Army of Mississippi for the South<br/><br/>Your goal as the leader of a vast amount of manpower and lands is to generate victory for your side, while gaining fame and prestige for yourself.<br/><br/>&quot;It is a well that war is so terrible, lest we grow too fond of it&quot; <br/>-Gen.

The deck consists of a total of 40 cards, five colors with numbers 1-8. The &quot;face cards&quot; numbered 1, 2, 5, and 8 of each color have portraits of military commanders on them.<br/><br/>The flow of the game follows that of basic trick taking.<br/>Each player plays a card, starting with the lead player. If you have a card in hand that matches the suit of the lead player's card you must play it. After all cards have been played, the &quot;highest&quot; strength card determines who wins the trick. <br/>What determines &quot;highest&quot; strength can change based on how many face cards were played (0 or an even number, the card with the higher number is stronger. Odd number, the card with the lower number is stronger). Place any face cards you win in front of you so that you can see the number.<br/><br/>Do this until you run out of cards in your hand, then calculate your score. The cards you have won are grouped by number, and for each number, if you collect an odd amount of cards, you will get a total of 1 point , and if you collect an even amount of cards, you will get 0 points. <br/>Example: You collected three 2s=1 point and two 8s = 0 points.<br/>After calculating the score, if someone's total score meets or exceeds 5 points, the game ends.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The day has come!  As an Apprentice in the ancient art of Alchemy, you will race to prove your skill by being the first to complete creations from the books of the Master&rsquo;s library.  Each creation requires the combination of four different components, as well as the correct placement on the arcane circle.  Think fast, outmaneuver your friends, and use your abilities to become the next Master Alchemist!<br/><br/>Alchemist Library is a fast-paced game for two to four people which can be played with in 20 to 30 minutes.  Each turn the players will play a card from their hand, either adding a Component to the board, or using an ability.  However, one player holds the Master Talisman, an artifact which gives them more powerful versions of each ability, which they can then use to their advantage, whether it is their turn or not.  Once the Talisman is used, it is passed to the next player, so use it wisely!<br/><br/>The game is all about set collecting, but with a twist, and while each player is trying to get the correct position matching one of the books in hand.  As the board fills up, matching elements or materials can be stacked on top of one another, to change the layout in your favor, or slow down your opponents.  Every player can also score at any time, so pay close attention to the board, as your friends may give you exactly what you need.  Be the first Apprentice to complete 3 books to win the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

When cyan, magenta, and yellow ink are paired with a red, green, and blue light only the corresponding ink will be visible. Effectively, one 2d image can hold 3 images and each image can be selected by the player at will. This is the first time that this discovery has been applied to card / board gaming.<br/><br/>The RGB card game system is based on traditional playing cards. The main difference is that there are only 48 regular cards, ranking from 1 &ndash; 12 and 6 color changing cards which can also be used as wild cards (you can print more if you see fit). The suits are the colors red, green, and blue. So, keeping that in mind it is possible to play most traditional playing card games but with a twist. It is up to players how they will adapt traditional games to the RGB system.<br/><br/>It is best to use a red/green/blue light bulb to play, it is also best to play in a dark or dimly lit area. The RGB light should be placed above the playing surface and positioned in a manner as to not shine into anyone&rsquo;s eyes directly. That being said it is also possible to use the screen of a single or multiple smartphone(s) or tablet(s) by displaying a red/green/blue background and using the device(s) as if they were lights. However, using device screens in this manner will not have as good as a result as using a RGB light bulb.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

While you are in the process of clearing your trash district, you can knock your opponents home, but be careful, you can also be knocked home yourself. Use the parking spaces as sheds. Whoever has cleared their district first and delivered their waste to the right place has won.<br/><br/>The game has both high entertainment value and contains learning elements for both children and adults. The game gives the child the opportunity for strategic and tactical development at the same time as it increases awareness of waste sorting. The game has several tactical layers, so as an adult you can also test your strategic abilities. Playing Skraldeludo with children creates the basis for a dialogue about an important topic in our everyday lives. The game is also fun for adults to play.<br/><br/>Trash Ludo is produced from FSC certified paper or wood. This means that in the production of trash ludo, a social responsibility has been taken, both in relation to the environment and the employees in the production.<br/><br/>The game is for 2-4 participants and can be played by children up to 6 years old.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Knight More was released in Japan at the 2014 Tokyo Game Market and is a trick-taking game for 3 to 5 players. The deck features 4 suits (Knights, Archers, Spearmen, Swordsman) ranked 1 to 10. The deck also includes 2 unsuited Ambush cards. The goal of the game is to avoid getting eliminated from play and to take the final trick of the game.<br/><br/>The game takes place over 6 rounds. At the start of each round players are dealt a hand of cards, receiving one less during the deal in each subsequent round (6 in round one, 5 in round two, etc). A random trump suit is revealed from the top of the undealt card deck. Players will try to take tricks using standard &quot;must follow&quot; rules. The winner of a trick is determined by assessing who played the highest value in the lead suit or the highest valued trump. When following suit, the unsuited Ambush cards may be played at any time whether suit can be followed or trumped. Ambush cards rank higher than any suited card, including trump. However, when resolving a trick that includes an Ambush, if a 1 rank card in any suit is present the Ambush is ineligible to win the trick. If both Ambush cards are played to the same trick, the second played wins.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, any players who have taken zero tricks are eliminated from the game. The player who wins the most tricks in a round will be the lead player of the next. The game continues until one of the following occurs:<br/><br/>1) A player wins the game by collecting all tricks in a round, leaving all other players with zero tricks.<br/><br/>2) A player wins the game by making it to round 6 and winning the final trick.<br/><br/>There is an optional variant called &quot;Guerrilla Operations&quot;. The game is played the same, except the first time a player takes zero tricks in a round they are not eliminated. Instead, in the following round they are dealt a single card. During that round, on their turn they may play this card into any trick of their choosing. If they don't want to play it into a trick they may pass. If a player can use this card to win a trick they will re-enter the game in the following round. A player is only eligible to receive the single card second chance if it's the first time they end a round with zero tricks. If a player collects zero tricks for a second time after having re-entered the game previously or fails to win a trick with their single second chance card, they are eliminated.<br/><br/>",

He gives each player the coins: 2 coins of 10, 4 coins of 5, 10 coins of 2 and 20 coins of 1.<br/>Each player deposits 2 coins into bowls 1-6 and the pot in the middle. The banker does the same but fills the pot up to 12 coins.<br/>The banker begins to roll all 3 dice. Only 3 rounds are rolled. The give/take die determines whether the player has to deposit or withdraw money. The number die indicates the cup you pay into or receive from. The die with the eyes determines the amount of the win or the deposit.<br/>Bowl 1 and 6: Doubles the bet. You pay or receive twice as much as you rolled eyes.<br/>Double: In the case of a double, i.e. if the numbers on the number dice and the number dice are the same, the pot also plays. <br/>If a bowl becomes empty during the 3 rounds, it is the banker's duty to refill it to the original deposit of all players. In return, the pot in the middle belongs to the banker after the end of the 3 rounds <br/>Final round: When the 3 rounds have been rolled, the banker only starts with the number die. Each player now gets the total contents of the bowl he rolled. Play continues until all bowls are emptied. In the new game, the next player automatically becomes the banker.<br/><br/>",

There&rsquo;s a fortune to be made and history to be written by those courageous enough to journey through the rail wilderness.<br/><br/>Part wargame, part worker placement game, part resource management game, Derailed is a fun and exciting experience for 1-6 players with numerous ways to play, adding levels of depth and complexity to suit any player; casual boardgame players through to avid wargamers will find something to love, from the rich setting with a wealth of lore, to a ruleset that's easy to learn but hard to master. Six different factions offer a variety of play styles based on their unique special rules.<br/><br/>The objective of Derailed is simple enough: complete your journey alive and with the most tickets in hand. To do so, you first build your train, hire crew and purchase supplies for the voyage. Six different engine types, eight different carriages and a wide selection of weapons and upgrades affords you plenty of options to create your own unique train. Crew are your resource for performing actions aboard your train, represented by dice. Once you have your train and crew ready, load up with fuel, cargo and passengers to make your trek as profitable as possible.

        "description": "The positions of the white pieces (officers) are drawn by lot for each game and are also decisive for the deployment of Black. <br/>All figures, unless they are in their usual place, have double the possibility of movement from their deployment line and only from this line, depending on their quality and their location. So for example, a knight on square 1a is also a rook (knight rook), a rook on b1 is also a knight (rook knight), a knight on c1 is also a bishop (knight bishop), etc. Any move that contradicts the quality of a piece is called a free move.<br/>The players must always keep the usual line-up in mind. If a figure moves to another square in its deployment row or returns to it in the course of the game, it has twice the possibility of moving from this deployment row if it does not end up in its usual place. The king also participates in the increased freedom of movement of the figures. However, as in castling, he may not step over a square where he could be captured, may not take a free move once he has moved, or evade check by a free move. Castling itself is only allowed in free chess if the king is in its usual place.<br/>Otherwise the regular chess rules apply.<br/><br/>The Game was published in a booklet called &quot;Zwei neue Kriegsspiele&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The box set contains 36 vibrantly illustrated picture cards, 4 bingo boards and a book with instructions and fascinating facts about bugs. There are lots of bugs to match and talk about, including spiders, ladybirds, butterflies and bees.<br/><br/>Players each have their own individual boards with a shared grid of tiles in the middle of the table.  They take turns flipping a tile over to see if it matches one of the spaces on their board. If it does it is placed on the board.  If it does not, it is flipped face down in the same spot.<br/><br/>This is a memory game for children that also affords the opportunity to learn about the bugs with the included information.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Released at the 2022 Fall Tokyo Game Market in Japan, Fruity Fruit is a trick-taking game that heavily incorporates tile placement mechanics and resource gathering.<br/><br/>Fruity Fruit uniquely does not utilize a deck of cards for its trick play. Instead it uses tiles in 4 different suit colors (red, green, yellow, blue). In each suit color there are tiles valued 1 to 9 in sizes that vary by value. The breakdown of tile sizes are:<br/><br/><br/>     All 1,2,3 value tiles are 4 squares in length<br/>     All 4,5,6,7 value tiles are 3 squares in length<br/>     All 8,9 value tiles are 2 squares in length<br/><br/><br/>At the start of the game and in turn order, each player will draw a hand of 4 scoring cards from a deck of 9 and choose one to keep. When each player has a single scoring card, all unchosen cards are returned to the box unrevealed. Each player will then take a turn blindly drawing 3 tiles from the bag of 36. These tiles are kept secret and are placed behind their player blind. The drawing phase continues in this manner until the bag is empty. Each player is then given one basket tile, which has 4 empty spaces on it where acquired fruit tokens may be placed. On the table is a 10x10 game board with fruit, basket, and insect symbols printed on it.<br/><br/>Tricks are played using the tiles each player has drawn. The game uses standard &quot;must follow&quot; trick-taking rules with the trump suit always being the red suit. To begin a trick, the lead player places one of their tiles onto the game board. In turn order, each other player must follow suit by playing a tile of the same color to the board. If a player can not follow suit they may place any color tile they would like. When placing a tile it must be orthogonally adjacent to a previously placed tile. Anytime a player covers a fruit symbol on the board, a token of that type is taken from the supply and placed in the middle of the table. If covering a basket or insect symbol a player receives immediately receives it. Once all players have placed a tile onto the board the trick's winner is determined:<br/><br/><br/>     If a player's has no empty spaces on their basket tile(s), they are not eligible to win the trick.<br/>     If any player couldn't play a tile to the board during the placement phase, they are not eligible to win the trick.<br/>     The player who played the highest value of the lead color or the highest trump is the winner of the trick.<br/><br/><br/>The trick's winner will take all fruit tokens placed in the middle of the table and place them into their basket(s). Any fruit that can't be placed in an empty basket space must be returned to the center of the table. The trick winner then leads the next trick. If any player isn't able to play a tile to the board due to unavailable space, that player is skipped and the game proceeds in turn order. It is possible for a trick to be comprised of a single tile.<br/><br/>Play continues until either one player is out of tiles or no player is able to place any more tiles. When either happens players proceed to scoring. All players score points based on their score card drawn at the beginning of the game. For each insect token a player has in front of them, one of their highest valued fruit is discarded and will not be scored. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "里山さすてぃなぶる (Satoyama Sustainable) is a card game from Japan, themed on the Satoyama landscape that exists in Japan. Satoyama is the area between arable flatland and the foothills of the mountains (sato 里 means village, and yama 山 means hill).<br/><br/>In the game, players are placing cards in a pyramid, representing the food chain in a Satoyama area. The players' goal is to keep the area healthy by maintaining a good balance between vegetation, herbivores and carnivores.<br/><br/>The cards show anime-style images of the plants and animals as cute girls. Foreign or alien species must be kept out to allow the native speices to flourish. A good balance must be kept, otherwise the ecology will collapse quickly. If there is too much food, the predators will increase and overload the system. If there is not enough food, the predators will die out.<br/><br/>Players can win in different ways. By eliminating alien species, they can achieve an aggressive win. By causing the other players' ecosystems to collapse, or eliminating three native species, they get a passive win. By maintaining a system and scoring more points, they gain a judgement win.<br/><br/>The designer likens the game to Tsume Shogi, which are Shogi puzzles in which a player must force a win or lose immediately. The game is designed to show the fragile nature of ecosystems in Japan.<br/><br/>The game can be played solitaire. A revised edition was published with extra cards, improved graphic design, added  trivia and a supplementary set of rules by the designer.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

If the Trick Star card is chosen, it goes against the Big card if the other card is the 5, otherwise it goes against the Small.<br/><br/>The start player then chooses one of their face-down cards and puts it forward, with some chips bet on it. Their opponent must now advance their matching Big/Small card and match the bet in chips. The two cards are revealed and the highest wins, the player taking all the chips.

(The rulebook, being written in a comedic and highly satirical tone itself, explicitly denies these connections to actual events.)<br/><br/>Each turn consists of rolling a 6-sided die, then drawing a card from the corresponding &ldquo;Odd Roll&rdquo; or &ldquo;Even Roll&rdquo; deck and following any instructions to add or remove tokens from one&rsquo;s player board. When any one section of a player board is fully covered, that player draws a card from the &ldquo;Build or Bust!&rdquo; deck, which will either declare that player the winner or penalize them.<br/><br/>",

Civilisation has crumbled and now its edifices bob with the current.<br/><br/>You see one now, a former museum perhaps, whatever it was it looks like it would make a good addition to your city. You wind up the giant electromagnetic harpoon cannon and bring the building into sight. In the distance, on the other side of the flow you see activity.

We need it more!<br/><br/>Welcome to the twin cities of Flotsam Falls.<br/><br/>The ends of the earth are just the beginning.<br/><br/>As players you&rsquo;ll be guiding one of the two cities.

The polluted and contaminated planet Earth has become an inhospitable home for humanity, whose global population has split into two ideological factions.<br/><br/>The Progress Movement professes a techno-optimistic belief in never-ending virtual growth and progress through the constant development of new technologies. Poisonous air and water, along with a weakened atmosphere, have forced this segment of humanity to live in vast, mostly underground metropolises where most of the inhabitants hardly ever see sunlight. They have largely entrusted the fulfillment of their needs to robots and virtual reality.<br/><br/>The rest of humanity, left out in the wilderness, has gradually adapted to the changes. The Balance movement is guided by a fundamentalist philosophy of sustainability and total balance between man and nature. These communities are governed by strict rules regarding the behaviour and lifestyles of their members, which are enforced by severe penalties. Zero waste and near 100% recycling requires a demanding lifestyle, but contributes to their resilience.<br/><br/>In the metropolises of Progress, people had no idea that any civilized society could survive outside. When diminishing geothermal resources, coupled with fluctuating solar activity, began to cause increasingly frequent energy problems, they were forced to send explorers into the wilderness in search of new resources. To their surprise, vegetation returned to parts of the surface in the form of radioactive jungle, and they quickly began to replenish the energy necessary to run their cities by burning the biomass they harvested there.<br/><br/>The clash between Balance and Progress was not long in coming. Any hope of reconciliation is completely unthinkable for ideological reasons. The last clash in human history, the final conflict, begins.<br/><br/>",

Likewise, the attackers (either troops of low level goons, or powerful kaiju monsters) have their own strengths and special abilities. Only by combining the right classes and specialities, the players can defeat the monsters.<br/><br/>The cards come with a lot of text, so the game may be restricted to Japanese readers.

        "description": "Card Barrage is a head-to-head dexterity-based tower defense game. Players hone their dexterity skills and finesse at card tossing through attacking your opponent&rsquo;s castle. At the start of the game, players lay out a card to represent their castle and its surrounding wall cards. Each turn, players physically toss cards against the other player&rsquo;s castle and surrounding wall cards. Players score points when their barrage cards land on the other player&rsquo;s castle or wall cards. Wall cards can be damaged and destroyed through attacks. You can play solo, head-to-head or team vs team. Rules govern how you can toss cards to attack through the lob, Frisbee, or flip method.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE &ndash; The objective of Card barrage is to score points through attacking your opponents&rsquo; castle and castle walls. Successfully tossed cards that land on your opponent&rsquo;s castle or is surrounding wall cards will score a point.<br/>GAME PLAY &ndash; Each turn players may build a wall, upgrade a wall, and attack. Build a wall by playing a card into a previously destroyed wall section. Upgrade a wall by exchanging a wall card with a card in hand. If you did not build a wall, attack an opponent&rsquo;s castle and wall by tossing a card to score points.<br/>GAME END AND WINNING &ndash; The game ends when one player has scored 10 points or destroyed all their opponent&rsquo;s walls and then hits their opponent&rsquo;s castle with all players getting an equal number of turns. The player with the most points wins.<br/>THEME &ndash; Medieval Setting and Castle sieges<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player&rsquo;s engine starts at one of 4 London stations (Paddington, Euston, King&rsquo;s Cross, and Waterloo) and moves along twinned track. The track has coloured spaces that when landed upon require the moving player to draw one or more cards that have various consequences. There are also numbered spaces on the track that when landed upon indicate the number of cars to be added behind the engine - thereby affecting the speed at which the engine moves. The number of cars and engine speed is tracked on individual player cards. A chart is consulted and a single die is rolled to determine engine speed/movement, which stays in effect until the number of cars changes. Slower engines can block faster moving engines going the same direction and you may have to wait until an oncoming engine (placed on the board from a drawn card) goes to a siding before moving forward.<br/><br/>",

Participants from all over the quaint and somewhat quirky English village of Upper Wallingham have arrived to compete for the &lsquo;Golden Trout&rsquo; &ndash; a trophy only the best can win.<br/><br/>Choose the best fishing locations along 5 stretches of the river, load up your bait and fish like you&rsquo;ve never fished before.<br/><br/>A colourful roll and write, number placement and fish drawing game. Game Play comes in two modes - Beginner and Pro Fishers with low ink and colour game sheets.<br/><br/>Before the tournament begins, each fisher (player) rolls 1 or 2 dice to see what type of zone their middle stretch of the river will become for the duration of the game.  This alters fishing strategies for individual players for varied game play.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/><br/>Roll 2 dice (2 six-sided die) and use the numbers to decided where to enter them (fish) on each turn. There are 5 zones along the river to choose from, with 25 fishing spots. The catch (pun intended) is that number entry must be in order with no repeats.<br/><br/>Fishers may alternatively use their turn to buy worm bait or upgrade equipment. Fishers will need to manage worm bait carefully - this is used to alter dice numbers and is essential for tricky fishing spots. You only get a certain number of turns before the tournament is over so make every one count.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>Players complete zones to start scoring points and increase their points by fishing twice in the same spot and drawing fish. Completing certain zone combinations will get you bonus points. Pro Fishers have more ways to score and play.<br/><br/>Pro fisher mode:<br/><br/>Pros may use 'hot zones' that change on each turn.<br/><br/>Fishing in hot zones catches high scoring or multiple fish - but avoid river rubbish or points will be deducted!<br/><br/>Pro fishers will need to balance buying and using bait, upgrading fishing weights and utilising hot zones productively to get the high scores.<br/> &mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It can be played solo or with up to 4 players with 1-4 miniatures per side.<br/><br/>Game Pitch<br/>Each player creates a Cazador, a brave and formidable hunter hellbent on defeating fearsome mythical beasts, twisted beings, uncanny horrors, and other terrifying Adversaries. Cazadores are joined by a rare few Companions willing to follow them into the wilderness, through the desert, across mountains, and into the lairs of monstrous things and the darkness between the planes.<br/><br/>Cazadores is a narrative-focused game that can be played solo or cooperatively. It only requires 1-4 miniatures per side and a 24&quot;x24&quot; space, making it a perfect kitchen table game and introduction to those new to the miniatures hobby.<br/><br/>Features<br/>A simple d10 dice pool system that resolves actions in a single roll (e.g., to hit, damage, and modifiers)<br/> A Time-based initiative system where actions cost &quot;Ticks&quot; contributing to a more dynamic flow for combat.<br/>Streamlined stats and decision trees that make Foes' actions easy to determine and execute.<br/>Unique attacks and abilities for Adversaries using a standard deck of playing cards to make them special and intriguing enemies.<br/><br/>Design Goals<br/>The game was inspired by my desire to get more use out of miniatures from big box board games, usually from Kickstarter, like Blood Rage, Kingdom Death Monster, etc., that just don't see the table that often. Frankly, it also helps I can work on it while not being able to meet in person with others.<br/><br/>The current version has five Adversaries to take on but more are coming and the guts of the system are there. With a little imagination you can run with this to set up your own Hunts.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It will introduce you to many tourist attractions and activities on the island &ndash; the very famous ones as well as those still undiscovered. It&rsquo;s the first guide book which you can play and a perfect game for anyone who is dreaming or planning to visit Iceland!<br/><br/>It is an innovative hybrid board game for 2-5 players supported with a mobile application. It is designed in such a way to help you plan your trip to Iceland in real life. To do so, choose how many days you want to spend on the island and how many companions will you have. This decision will determine the level of the difficulty of the game and time needed to finish it. The more players and the less time you have, the more difficult it will be to achieve your goals. So watch closely what the others are doing and react when it is needed!<br/><br/>It may be a difficult task to plan your trip when you and your friends have different dream locations to visit and unfortunately time is limited for everyone. Moreover, all of you share the same rental 4&times;4 car, change as a driver frequently and face obstacles on your way, so sometimes you will need to make compromises. Remember, you won&rsquo;t ever be able to see everything.<br/><br/>There are multiple routes to choose from to reach your goals. Use your skills and planning techniques to seize the opportunities, react to the constantly changing situation on the road and convince other players to go where you would like to. Play it wisely (or mean!). This trip will be a real test for your characters. Travelling in a group is never an easy task however if you manage it well then you can go anywhere together!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Fears invaded his castle and broke his heart into several pieces.<br/>Now, as he walks through the castle, the Beast feels a terrifying fear.<br/>In this game you will learn about the Beast's fears, and you will have to have courage and determination to face them.

It is designed with four ways to play, though the system is robust enough to allow players to come up with their own games fairly easily. The four ways it is designed to be played are:<br/><br/>ADANELODI (Arrange!)- A strategy game for two to six players; collect sets of three cards while treating the discard pile as a shared hand. Similar to the classic, card game, Rummy, but with a few, key differences which create an entirely new (and fun!) experience.<br/>Ganesquaduga (Cartwheel)- A raucous, four-player, party game where players race to collect the numbers 1-13 in their hand, but with a twist! The player you just asked for a Seven might start a Cartwheel, and force you to pass some of your cards to the player on your right... and maybe even your whole hand!<br/>Galkwogi Iyanitsila (Seven Fires)- A solitaire game where you must build a fire to start seven other fires. Bearing elements of Free-Cell, Spider, and traditional Solitaire, this unique take on the idea of solitaire is easy to learn, and fun!<br/>Replace a deck of playing cards- The DISUYEDV deck can easily be used to play any game that is possible with a standard deck of playing cards. Instructions to do so are included with the deck.<br/><br/>",

In short, a fun game where you can be creative and please keep reading.<br/><br/>How To play?<br/><br/><br/>     Deck both Square cards and Shape cards separately and put 1 Square card in the middle of the table with the back side up. That square in the middle of the table is the Center square.<br/>     After completing the installation as written above, you can start the tour. The game consists of 2 rounds and at the end of the 2nd round, whoever reaches the highest score wins, if there is a draw, the 3rd round is played.<br/>     The player whose turn it is in the round draws 1 Shape card and takes as many square cards as the number written on the Shape card, then places the squares in accordance with their shape.<br/>     The player who places a square 6 squares away from the center square loses the round and the other player gets a point.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You must disperse this ancient evil before you succumb to it!&quot;<br/><br/>CRAWL! is a solo or 2-player game mode that utilizes the components of the Dark Venture Core Set (plus new characters, items, locations, and quests), activating them in a different way with the use of encounter tokens and new game rules.<br/><br/>In CRAWL! all Dark Venture enemies and unplayed heroes are sorted into separate decks based on their difficulty.

It offers an expanded battle system with intuitive card combinations that make every game unique.<br/><br/>Futory Cards is a deck building game in which up to four players buy cards from the Bazaar to create the strongest deck and defeat their opponents. With Landmarks, Creatures and Artifacts, the players go through four phases in which they try to remove the 24 Time Points from the other players.<br/><br/>Once 12 Time Points are lost, the Light Die gets removed from the player and they can no longer get up to 24 Time Points. A player has lost the game after their Dark Die gets removed.<br/><br/>If a player can no longer draw cards from their Future Pile, their History Pile gets shuffled and creates a new Future Pile. This dynamic feature enables long term strategic thinking.<br/><br/>Futory Cards II can also be linked with other titles from the Trilogy, allowing even more strategic variety and a higher player count.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, you only move the number of spots on one die on the board. You can always choose which of your pieces you want to advance with, but move figures at the start first! If you get on a space of your color, roll the dice again! Two figures of one player may not be on the same space at the same time! If you come to a space on which an opponent's figure is standing, you send it back to the castle. The track makes a circle in the middle of the board. Here you follow the arrows! If you land on the crossing point (black space), you block the way for your opponent. While waiting until you leave the point or get hit there, you are allowed to pass with your own character. You must reach the target spaces with the sword behind the cave entrance with a direct throw. Whoever is the first to get both of their pawns onto the target space of their color wins and returns the magic sword to the castle.<br/><br/>The game was published on the back of a box of &quot;Smacks&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stranger Tales is a role-playing game (RPG) and Board Game in which we will play the role of kids who will have to face the &ldquo;Evil&rdquo;. We are in the 1980s, an era that you probably experienced directly or indirectly through films, music, board games, videogames and everything that that unique and unrepeatable decade has left thanks to the echo of a time near and far. Did you know that the 80s were full of monsters and creatures of all kinds? If your answer is no, you probably did not directly experience that era or you have been told that it was just rumors; but if you lived it, if you were a child or a kid during those years, you know what I'm talking about. Monsters existed and walked around on their own legs. Of course, adults would never have believed you, but I can guarantee you that at that time Evil had eyes and legs, mouths and teeth.<br/><br/>The peculiarity of Stranger Tales is that you will have everything ready in one box: Just take it with you to experience fantastic adventures and you won't need anything else! Everything is in the box. Stranger Tales is also a mammoth work on &rsquo;80s and &rsquo;90s Pop Culture. In fact, in the definitive manual, you will find not only the rules to play but also contents that will help you identify yourself again&mdash;or for the first time&mdash;in a world so near and far.<br/><br/>The Fusion System that was born in Tales of Evil and continued in Boogeyman here evolves to the highest levels. It will only be your imagination and what you find in the stories that set the limits; but in reality, there is no limit whatsoever. You will be able to integrate into the game any action or behavior you wish in order to help your Investigators during your adventure. You may even be able to foresee that some Tests could take place outside of the usual game session, such as challenging players with special tasks to complete &ldquo;side quests&rdquo; in their real life.  For example, nothing prevents you from requesting a certain type of flower or object be brought the next time you get together to play, or performing real actions such as going to a place and hiding something there and then asking the other players to find the object that you have hidden before your next game session. As you can see, the limits to what you can create with the Fusion System are practically infinite. Don't like the Fusion System? Don't love taking actions in your real life to directly influence the game? No problem. In agreement with the other players, you can safely decide not to use the Fusion System for your games. The beauty of Stranger Tales is precisely this&mdash;that is to say, being able to adapt the game to your liking and in your image and likeness. Again, there is no limit.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Its name comes from the Italian words cavagnolo or cavagnola &quot;small basket&quot;. The game was mostly played by women of the aristocracy.<br/><br/>Jeu de Cavagnole is made up of a variable number of square cards, each card with five numbers, four in the corners and a fifth in the center. Each part of the game has an illustration (painted or engraved), usually of small popular subjects.<br/><br/>The game is similar to a lottery where you bet on the numbers that will come out, a bit like roulette (a game of chance). In turn, one of the players &quot;holds the bank&quot;, that is to say, extracts from a bag a numbered ticket that decides the gain or loss of the players. You bet by putting token coins on the numbers. You can play a whole card, two numbers in a row or a full number.<br/><br/>",

This privileged situation did not last long as amazement at their way of life led to hostilities.  The Gypsy way of life still leads to hostilities from people of their host nations.  Europeans regard &quot;private property&quot; as sacrosanct, whereas gypsies do not have a word for possess which gives to two incompatible ways of life and a continual problem of gypsies being regarded as &quot;thieves&quot; from the European's view.<br/><br/>The Object - Earn as much gold as we can and bring it to the Big Gypsy Gathering.  We need to help finance the various Festivities of Weddings, Baptisms, Meetings, Feasts and Entertainment.  This must be done before border checkpoints are closed, preventing us from travelling and earning our living. We have only two rounds of events to accomplish our goal of raising money for the Big Gypsy Gathering.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pineapple Royale is a card game in which players control different fruits in a battle to be the last one standing. Each fruit comes with its own unique stats and some have special abilities that can help them in battle. These may provide defenses, movement buffs, or ways to mess with your opponents. The fruits fight in an arena styled after a kitchen where there are objects such as countertops, kitchen sinks, and even an oven to move and position yourself around for battle. Some of these items take up territory, while others provide strategic benefits and threats to the players.<br/><br/>Players will need to collect kitchen utensil-themed cards to use against their opponents. You will start out with only a spork but can collect additional cards such as chef knives, graters, and chopsticks to increase your attack, or items such as fruit stickers to recover your health. Once a fruit runs out of their &ldquo;servings&rdquo; they are eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>The play area consists of a ring of randomly dealt cards that get shuffled around after each round. This creates constant variety as no two games or rounds will have the same layout to maneuver around. Movement is 2-dimensional around this circle, meaning your options can be limited depending on the randomly dealt battlefield.<br/><br/>During a game, you will find heavy amounts of social interactions as other players try to get you to gang up on other players, or keep the peace and draw a card instead of attacking them. All of the utensil cards (aside from the spork) can only be used once, creating a tricky balance between when to strike and when to wait for the chaos of the game to do the work for you. Once the first fruit is eliminated things will quickly spiral into chaos and bring about a quick conclusion to a game.<br/><br/>description from designer<br/><br/>",

During its turn, an aircraft may make any number of individual maneuvers (called &ldquo;segments&rdquo;).

It is the age of the Persian and Peloponnesian wars, of Salamis and the Arginusae, of Temistocles and Phormio, when triremes ruled the Mediterranean. Oi navarcoi! is a wargame ruleset to play fleet battles during that time.<br/><br/>The trireme was a long and thin unstable platform, with ram as the main armament. It was built for speed and for ramming, a man-propelled guided torpedo. Well trained crews could exploit the trireme's qualities with complex tactics such as the periplous or diekplous.<br/><br/>Oi Navarcoi aims to replicate this specific character of classical era naval warfare, which is different from the later Hellenistic and Roman periods &ndash; when ships got bigger and bigger and emphasis was definitely on boarding and missile fire (even with war engines!).<br/><br/>",

Don't reveal it yet, the only information you will have will be the Difficulty level, given by the number on the back of the card ranging from 1 to 3.<br/>Warning, Lv 3 Adventures give more rewards but also hide traps!<br/>After evaluating at the beginning of each turn whether to participate in that specific adventure, players can put one or more Adventurer Cards from their hand onto the field, initially face down.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The players in the Mammothodus are put in a situation where they must work together as a team to survive and to build a portal to another world in order to avoid the humans that are coming to eliminate your clans. The gameplay is simple but challenging, as each player must strategize on how they can build the portal while defending themselves against the humans. However, the challenge is compounded by the fact that the players are limited in time and resources. Players have to work together to build the portal before the humans reach them and kill them all. The game also offers an expansion pack that provides more clans and resources to the players in order to increase the chances of survival and completing the mission. <br/>The game mechanics itself is simple yet challenging. Players take turns moving figures around a gameboard with the goal of placing their pieces in strategic positions to build a portal and win. Depending on the complexity of the game, it can take anywhere from 60 minutes to 2 hours to complete a full game.<br/><br/>",

Each trade has five cards having values of 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 counters. The object of the game is to try to collect all five cards of their chosen trade, which is considered completing one&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stock&rdquo;.<br/><br/>All 25 trade cards (5x5) are shuffled with five dealt to each player. Each player also starts with counters totalling a value of 20. The first player selects a card from their hand to auction and places it face down on the table. The highest bidder wins the card and adds it to their hand, with the counters going to the seller. Should a player complete their &ldquo;Stock&rdquo;, it is announced (thus ending the game) and that player also receives a bonus of 10 counters.<br/><br/>The game also features 10 speculation cards - five of which earn additional counters (&ldquo;pay&rdquo;) and five deduct counters (&ldquo;draft on bank&rdquo;). These cards are placed face down and are usually drawn when a player is in financial distress. Players can also pawn any of their own trade cards for their face value in counters.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, any player who did not speculate during the game is required to draw one speculation card before determining final scores. The player with the highest score, calculated by adding the values of trade cards in hand plus the value of their counters, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players must field an ingredient card that they believe is contained in the recipe in play.<br/>Those who do not have the right ingredient or do not want to risk, can decide to fold, not playing any cards.<br/>When each player has made their choice, the one who started turns their card face up, revealing it. Then he lists aloud the ingredients present in that specific recipe and at that point he takes all the cards in play, placing them next to him, in a dedicated pile.<br/>The player (s) who have the wrong ingredient, playing a card that is not present in the specific recipe, draw 1 card from the pantry deck and 1 from the unexpected deck.<br/>Finally, always following the order of the turns, the next player places his recipe card in the center of the table, and so on.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to run out of cards in hand and when only one is missing, shout &quot;Spiked&quot;, under penalty of having to draw 2 cards from the dispensation deck.<br/><br/>The player whose turn it is to put his recipe card into play can decide to bluff, especially if he doesn't have one. The other players can accuse him of bluffing but before verifying it everyone must have completed their turn. Whoever has been caught bluffing will have to draw 2 cards from the dispensation deck and one from the unexpected deck; Who has guessed the bluff can discard a card from his hand; finally, in the event of a mistake on the part of the accused, he will be the one to draw a card from the dispensation deck.<br/><br/>The Recipe cards have 3 precise and fundamental classifications: Origin, Flavor and Type of Cooking. Pay attention to these categories whenever you encounter Unexpected cards that can facilitate or compromise your final victory.<br/><br/>     Provenance means the origin of the dish and you just need to know the state of origin, represented on the card by a flag.<br/>     The Flavors are divided into Salty - Spicy - Sweet - Sour and Vegetarian<br/>     Finally, the types of Preparation or Kitchen are divided into Pot - Pan - Oven or Fridge<br/><br/><br/>",

Get ready and&hellip;be dastardly!<br/><br/>Dastardly Drivers is a simple, fast-paced racing game where players compete against each other to cross the finish line first! But, to do that, they&rsquo;ll need to employ some strategy, some guile, and a bit of luck to avoid any obstacles on the track and finish ahead of the other racers.<br/><br/>Each player secretly chooses their actions for the round and each action is revealed in player turn-order (which changes based on the player position on the track). Players can also receive items that will aid them along the track or help them hinder their opponents.<br/><br/>The game supports up to 6 players and features a modular track creation system so no two races need to be the same! Want to do 1 lap of a long 20-tile track? Perfect! Want to do 3 laps of a short 8-tile track? Sounds great! Dastardly Drivers provides the components you need to make the track to your desired specifications!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Who will improve the CO2 balance and plant the most trees? Add to this the conversion of fossil power plants into renewable energy sources and the common goal of climate neutrality comes ever closer!<br/><br/>In the family game Das klimaneutrale Talent (DKT), the topics of environment, climate and sustainability take center stage, but without a raised forefinger, but with a lot of fun and a willingness to take risks, as well as a portion of luck. Based on the classic game Das kaufm&auml;nnische Talent, which has been known for generations, especially in Austria, free areas may be leased here and then planted with trees (later with forests), which positively influences the climate marker. Environmentally conscious people use the train in the game and everyone tries to do their part in shutting down fossil fuel power plants, as this commitment is rewarded at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Depending on your willingness to take risks and your financial strength, you can also make lively investments in &quot;The Climate-Neutral Talent&quot;, sometimes facing insolvency or even bankruptcy. Weather extremes, the CO2 tax and penalties for climate sinners provide additional excitement. However, one thing is always clear: the climate can only be saved by working together, which is why it's win or lose. Whoever has planted the most trees and forests is crowned climate hero.<br/><br/>Game target<br/>The goal is to work together to achieve climate lity. To achieve this, you must either convert three fossil fuel power plants into renewable energy sources or reduce CO&sup2; emissions to a minimum.<br/>In addition, the person who has planted the most trees will be crowned climate hero.<br/><br/>In a special way, The Climate Neutral Talent combines cheerful fun with informative facts about sustainable development and goals for climate neutrality according to the UN &quot;Agenda 2030&quot;. More is vividly explained in the accompanying booklet.<br/><br/>Of course, Piatnik has not only placed value on sustainability editorially, but also in the game production. Das klimaneutrale Talent is produced entirely with materials from the EU, and the (pre-)materials are FSC-certified. Administration and production at Piatnik in Austria use 100% green electricity. However, this does not only apply to this game, but for years already to the majority of Piatnik products.<br/><br/>All components used in the game were produced from biodegradable materials!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

Finally, increased difficulty levels let you only play mis-suited cards in a certain order, following the Kaizen business management approach.<br/><br/>The game was created by a local consultant who wanted to spread the word about this approach to work and life.<br/><br/>",

You don't need any previous knowledge to win the game. It's a fun, strategic and educational game accessible from 7 years old.<br/><br/>In the Middle Age, the frontier village of Larock was renowned beyond its borders. Nestled in the heart of the valley and surrounded by mountains, it is the home of the Druidess Eureka. Many villagers rush here in the hope of healing thanks to the advice of the Druidess. Unfortunately, she can't help all the visitors, she is overwhelmed. Your role as an apprentice harvester is to help her relieve the villagers.<br/><br/>The game can be played collaboratively or competitively.  If you play competitively, the winner is the first one to have the right plant card for his villager and to have it validated by the Druidess. Once a player has won, you can stop here or play until each player has healed its villager. In collaboration, the game ends when each player has relieved his own villager. <br/>May the journey begin!<br/><br/>",

It is aimed at being dramatic, exciting and occasionally over the top game of battle and space adventure. It is not meant to be a hardcore military game and the results are not meant to be particularly realistic.<br/><br/>-description from rulebook<br/><br/>Battles are fought in phases with alternating activations: In the action phase your figures take turns carrying out one action (moving, firing, doing something else) while in the firefight phase most figures can fire (potentially shooting a second time).<br/><br/>Combat uses a simple 2D6 table with several unexpected factors built in: Firers can fumble or inflict critical hits and the use of a separate Threat die can cause surprise reactions such as the targets diving for cover or firing back. Gun battles plays out quickly and chaotically.<br/><br/>Intended for head-to-head play with 10 scenario objectives to pick from, but offers tools for non player forces and a random unit generator. These are great for solo play or to have a third party force show up mid battle if you like.<br/><br/>With about 8-15 figures per side, SPiS occupies a middle ground between the man-to-man combat of Five Parsecs From Home and the larger battles of Renegade Scout / Clash on the Fringe by the same publisher.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ka&euml;l is a game of speed and strategy. The main goal will be to get rid of as many cards as possible to get the lowest score in your hands. However, pay attention to the cards of other players when you pronounce Ka&euml;l. Certain combinations of cards can be equal to 0 even though a player has 4 cards (example: -1/1/0/0 = 0).<br/><br/>This game is based on a point system. The goal is to be the last player to reach a score higher than 100. To do this, you must obtain the lowest possible score at the end of each round, the score is calculated by adding up the value of the cards in your hands at the end of each round.<br/><br/>At the end of the different rounds, the respective scores of each player will be added up. The first player to exceed 100 points will be eliminated and the game will continue until there is only one player below the 100 point threshold.<br/><br/>Ka&euml;l est un jeu de rapidit&eacute; et de strat&eacute;gie. Le but principal sera de vous d&eacute;lester d&rsquo;un maximum de cartes afin d&rsquo;obtenir le plus petit score entre vos mains. Faites n&eacute;anmoins attention aux cartes des autres joueurs lorsque vous prononcez Ka&euml;l. Certaines combinaisons de cartes peuvent &ecirc;tre &eacute;gales &agrave; 0 alors m&ecirc;me qu&rsquo;un joueur dispose de 4 cartes (exemple: -1/1/0/0 = 0).<br/><br/>Le jeu est bas&eacute; sur un syst&egrave;me de points. Le but est d&rsquo;&ecirc;tre le dernier joueur &agrave; atteindre  un score sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; 100. Pour ce faire, il conviendra d&rsquo;obtenir le score le plus bas possible &agrave; chaque fin de manche, le score se calculant en additionnant la valeur des cartes entre vos mains, &agrave; chaque fin de manche.<br/><br/>A l&rsquo;issue des diff&eacute;rentes manches, les scores respectifs de chaque joueur vont se cumuler. Le premier joueur &agrave; d&eacute;passer 100 points sera &eacute;limin&eacute; et la partie se poursuivra jusqu&rsquo;&agrave; ce qu&rsquo;il n&rsquo;y ait plus qu&rsquo;un joueur en dessous du seuil des 100 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are a planet.  You became self-aware about twenty minutes ago.  Five minutes ago, you discovered that you have the power to manipulate the environments of your surface.  Three minutes ago, you managed to create life out of the very elements.  Needless to say, these developments shocked and impressed the sentient life forms that had been forming tribes all over you for hundreds of generations.<br/><br/>Then, one minute ago, you felt the distinct sensation that you&rsquo;ve awakened before.  What were you doing?  It seemed very important at the time.<br/><br/>Two Thousand Years is a Make-As-You-Play campaign of solitaire card games.  Each game represents 100 years of warfare between your tribes.  Each tribe is represented by a card.  You make the cards yourself, and they are modified during and after every game with advancements, corruption, extra staying power, and many other characteristics.<br/><br/>At the end your campaign, whether you win or lose, you will have generated a history of your peoples (of any type that you imagine) and important landmarks (also pretty much up to you).<br/><br/>It is a game of patience and foresight and planning.  The board will want to clear itself, and you need to stop it by using clever sequences and mystic powers!  Rash decisions may carry brutal, permanent consequences.  You might want to have a space in your home where you can leave a game undisturbed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The goal of Blocus is for each player (or team) to delimite as large a territory as possible on the board. The boundaries of this territory are determined by the movement of each player's (or team's) pieces. In fact, each player, while placing each of their pieces on a square, must simultaneously place a counter of their color (white, black, or red) on that square. It is these markers that determine the outlines of the borders of the territory conquered by the player (or team). There is no specific rule for a starting lineup of figures. Each player places his figures where he wants on his first moves and immediately marks the square with a marker in his color.<br/><br/>The figures have different shapes and colors so that each player (or team) can identify their own. However, all have the same value and move in the same way: like the chess queen, they can move horizontally, vertically or diagonally, in any direction, one, two or more squares.<br/><br/>However, under no circumstances may a figure cross a square already covered by a counter, regardless of the color of that counter. Also, a figure cannot land on a square that is already covered by a counter. It also cannot go over a square occupied by another piece and of course it cannot stop there either. A figure that can't move anymore is eliminated from the game.<br/><br/>A game ends when all of a player's (or team's) pieces are eliminated. Whether there are two, three or four players, a game also ends when a total of five figures have been removed from the game. The final score is determined by counting the empty squares within the borders. There is one point for each empty square.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The rules are the same as regular chess, except for these changes. Every piece has a nominal value attached to them. E.g. The Queen is worth six, a Pawn is worth one. Pieces move like in traditional chess. You can capture opposing pieces, which will then transform them according to their former value minus the value of the opposing piece, into the piece which value it now represents. This applys vice-versa. For example: Queen(6) captures Pawn(1) and will transform into a Rook(5), or Pawn(1) captures Rook(5) which transforms said Rook into a Knight(4). The pieces that go below value one will be put outside the board. You can also capture your own pieces, which adds their values together and promotes the capturing piece accordingly.<br/><br/>To make transformation handier, the status of the set pieces (whether it&lsquo;s a Knight or a Bishop) is displayed on each side of a die. The board is a seven by seven squared chess board. To account for the six sides of a die, a new piece has been added, which we of today call Geminus, which acts like a doubled Pawn and can capture one square diagonally in any direction and can move one or two squares forward or one back.<br/><br/>The goal is like in traditional chess, to check mate the King of the opposing side.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The city of Cold War Berlin is represented by an additional special space in the centre of the board.&rdquo;<br/><br/>What the two adversaries need to play:<br/><br/>     The Print &amp; Play game board (available in the files section)<br/>     16 wooden playing pieces (tokens, pawns or blocks etc) [8 each of two different colours]<br/>     The 16 Print &amp; Play images that need to be affixed to the underside of the playing pieces [4 Agents, 2 Moles and 2 Decoys each]<br/><br/><br/>Objective of the game and how to play:<br/>The winner of the game is the Spymaster with the most points at the end of the game.  The game ends after all 16 pieces (representing KGB and SIS Agents (or Operations if you prefer) have been played out &ndash; i.e., both players&rsquo; hands of playing pieces are empty; or, after the conclusion of an agreed number of turns (usually set at 12).<br/><br/>Pieces are played to the board, which is a 4-by-4 grid forming a schematic representation of key European Cold War capitals, with the city of Berlin represented by an additional &lsquo;special&rsquo; space in the middle of the board.  The cities represented - in addition to Berlin - are Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki, London, Amsterdam, Warsaw, Moscow, Paris Bonn, Prague, Vienna, Lisbon, Madrid, Rome and Sofia.<br/>Points are awarded at the end of a game for each chain of two or three adjacent cities the two players have Agents or Moles in.  Chains can be orthogonal or diagonal.  Chains of two earn 2 points and chains of three 3 points.  Berlin cannot be used to accumulate points but has a special role in the game in that it is the only location on the board in which &lsquo;stacking&rsquo; is allowed.  At player discretion however &lsquo;supremacy&rsquo; in Berlin may be used to adjudicate ties.<br/><br/>Players can do one of the following five things on their turn:<br/>1 Place one of their pieces in any one of the sixteen cities, provided the space representing that city is empty.<br/>2 Relocate one of their own pieces already on the board to any other city, provided the space representing the new location is empty.<br/>3 Place a piece as 1 above and then &ldquo;shunt&rdquo; it and all other pieces one location in any single orthogonal plane. *<br/>4 Place a piece in Berlin or &ldquo;stack&rdquo; a piece on an opponent&rsquo;s piece already there. (Maximum stack: one piece each.) <br/>5 Use the topmost piece in Berlin, if it is theirs, to shunt a piece or pieces along any one of the four diagonal planes extending from the city. *<br/><br/>[*Note: If a piece is shunted off the board, it enters the other player&rsquo;s hand, irrespective of allegiance.]<br/><br/>Scoring examples are illustrated in the rules located in the files section.<br/><br/>Notes on restrictions and other essential rules:<br/>In the basic game, players cannot &ldquo;relocate&rdquo; their adversary&rsquo;s pieces.  They can only be moved by &lsquo;shunting&rsquo;.<br/><br/>Players cannot forego their turn if they possess unplaced pieces.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Shunting&rsquo; is orthogonal from the 16 cities comprising the 4-by-4 board.  It is diagonal from Berlin.<br/><br/>A piece passed to a player as a result of shunting should not be examined by the shunting player.  The player receiving the piece will be able to look at its hidden side once it is in their hand.<br/><br/>Pawns and stacking<br/>Players preferring to use pawns for playing pieces can simulate stacking by the way the pawns are positioned in the Berlin space on the board &ndash; a Top and Bottom within the space is clearly apparent.<br/>     <br/>Variant rules<br/>A number of variant rules can be adopted at set-up by mutual agreement of the players.  These are included with the base game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The main deck is inspired by standard playing cards allowing you to enjoy traditional card games in style!<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>Depending on player count, a specific number of cards are dealt out from the main deck to each player. These cards remain face down and are not looked at. The player to the left of the dealer chooses an opponent to battle. They then choose a &quot;spirit&quot; among their force to flip over. This attacking player then chooses a spirit among their opponent's force to be flipped over. The player with the higher number wins. Both flipped spirits are discarded and<br/>the winner of the battle replaces their spirit with another from the main deck. The loser does not replenish and now has 1 less spirit in their force. This continues until there is only one player left.<br/><br/>Additional play:<br/><br/>Gifts are items(Supplies)and additional spirits(Supports)that are gained in battle. They have varying abilities that can help change the outcome of the game.<br/><br/>A Versatile Card Game:<br/>This is the main way to play, but it is not the only way. Be creative and start up your own version of Spirit Master. Change some rules or add new mechanics altogether. Inside are a few game variations to get players started. The game is also modular and can have additional decks added or removed to extend or change your game. Players could even bring their own full Spirit Master collection and battle it out in a massive clash of spirits.

There are also 10 Optional Cards, 8 of which provide specific Events equally affecting both sides, and 2 &quot;Halt!&quot; Cards which can end the Movement and/or Fire Phases early. For the more sadistic among you, there are 2 &quot;blanks&quot; for creating your own Events. Finally, there is a Card providing some instruction on use of the Deck.<br/><br/>Using contemporary full color illustrations and terminology specific to the foe facing the British/Imperialist players, each Action Deck not only speeds the steps of play, but heightens the &quot;atmosphere&quot; to make every exciting game even more so!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The booklet describes a ritualized dice game used by the miners at Stora Kopparberg in order to help the miners to make decisions in connection with the organization of this hazardous work.<br/><br/>The reader shall throw three dice, and then look for the same score in the booklet. Three six-sided dice, numbered from one to six, give a total of 56 different combinations if you throw all three simultaneously. Consequently, the text itself consists of 56 rhymed stanzas, combined with schematic pictures of three dice that are linked to all possible combinations.  Every poem gives the miner different rules for living and moral advice as an answer to a wish made before he threw the dice.<br/><br/>Those who manage to score highest may be first in the pair line* and have an advantage over the others, who must wait further down the pair line. But the one coming last will be stuck there because of his low and unlucky throw. This may be due to a three, four and six on the dice. Those who come first are likely to get copper, and those who are last get just rocks.<br/><br/><br/>    Pair line = The term was used to denote the order in which the mining teams took turns to break ore in the mine.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

He will be glad if a certain horse ends the season at a certain rank and he will appreciate your help in the matter. Other players are Don's other fixers with similar, non-contradictory errands. You will play as a team trying to accomplish as many orders as possible, because if someone screws up, Don will not care who and will be disappointed in all you. Yet he does not allow you to tell your order to others because the old man is not a believer of sharing information.<br/><br/>Code of Silence is a euro style cooperative game with limited communication. It is played with 3-6 players and also includes a solo variant. Regardless of how many players there are around the table, there are always 6 horses and 6 secret orders in the game. In the beginning everyone knows one secret order but some orders may not be known by anyone.<br/><br/>On your turn you will choose a race card from your hand to play. Every card moves multiple horses and makes progress towards one useful action or another. You will need to make hard decisions where all your moves are ambiguous and what benefits a task often harms another task. The game also includes events that introduces further randomness, a betting system and secondary tasks that give some immediate benefits and victory points.<br/><br/>Code of Silence is a funny yet challenging game with medium complexity where strategy, communication, deduction, intuition play equal parts.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Most points win.<br/><br/>There are nine categories: Film &amp; TV, Food &amp; Drink, Politics &amp; History, Geography, Music, Sports, Culture, Nature &amp; Science, and Beer.<br/><br/>The game suggests that the loser buys a round - and that you drink responsibly.<br/><br/>The game has been made in a collaboration between the brewery Grimbergen and the game studio Bezzerwizzer.<br/><br/>",

If a player wishes to lay down a set, he must do so before discarding.<br/><br/>Aces are wild within their own suit - i.e. Ace of Spades can be any Spade, Ace of Hearts can be any Heart, etc.<br/><br/>Once one player has laid down all their cards, both players work out their scores as follows:<br/><br/>For each set laid down score 20 points.<br/>For each matching set laid down score an additional 50 points - e.g. 3,4,5 of Hearts matches 3,4,5 of Spades.<br/><br/>The first player who lays down all their cards also scores points for all the cards left in their opponent&rsquo;s hand. Both players score points for all sets laid down, regardless of who lays down first. In fact it is possible for the player going out first to score less than their opponent if the other player has matching sets.<br/><br/>First to 1000 points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pieces are creatures who love to do imitations. One by one, they all imitate something different. Not a single one has a fixed form. None of them have a fixed form.<br/><br/>Pieces (ピーシーズ) is a sandbox game containing 35 3D-printed pieces in a drawstring bag. Each piece is a different simple shape that the players can use to communicate with each other. The intention is that players will use the included rules or create their own games that use the Pieces. Instructions are included for sharing the games you create through social media.<br/><br/>The game includes rules for at least eight different games that use the Pieces, including a twist on Shiritori (a word chain game where each new word begins with the last letter of the word before), charades (using combinations of Pieces in a guessing game), group storytelling using drawn Pieces to suggest where the story goes, and Shape Poker (where you try to create poker-style groupings). The game includes a small three-by-three board for games like Triple Word Chain, where you try to get three words chained in a row.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Split the Party is a dice-placement board game themed around fantasy roleplaying, where you are taking on the role of an adventuring party made up of classic themes such as Mage, Warrior, Rogue, etc. The hook for this game, however, is that each of these character archetypes are represented by a custom d10 die, with different skill faces on each one. You place these dice around the board in areas that represent places an adventurer might visit in a fantasy town and its surrounding areas, such as the Tavern, Shop, Wizard's Tower and Dungeons. Then after each player has placed all of their dice, players encounter cards at those locations, trying to succeed at checks to defeat or acquire those cards by rolling the dice workers themselves, earning victory points or gold to buy useful items, etc. The player with the highest total victory points at the end of five rounds is the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Before the game begins, each player will select one of 96 unique deck combinations by drafting a primary and secondary class representing classical RPG archetypes and job systems. Players will then further customize their decks to create an additional layer of intrigue for their coming battle.<br/><br/>Players take turns advancing on battlefields which can be captured by multiple objectives. Players select up to three tactics to use each turn, with each tactic offering multiple options to ensure that no turn is wasted. These options include playing cards to advance their position on battlefields, activating abilities, strengthening their units, damaging rival units, and drawing cards to enhance their position. Battlefields are captured through area majority or through unique terrain based objectives which offer alternate means to victory. The game ends when one player has amassed 16 or more Victory Points from capturing battlefields and has claimed the throne of Erudia.<br/><br/>Erudia is unique in its design in that it contains a predetermined number of planned expansions that have been designed in advance, allowing for a single, consistent rulebook as well as narrative hints and spoilers of how the war unfolds. New classes and content will be added through expansions regularly, but Erudia also proudly features a Community Content Initiative where players get to collaboratively design actual content that will be included in the game. This Core Set contains two such classes, with more opportunities for involvement in the future. Overall, the Core Set contains 8 primary decks and 13 secondary decks for a total of 96 unique armies that are further customizable for endless replayability!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ekosi is the card game played by the characters in the upcoming indie video game Freeborn (formerly Luckless Seven).  As a reward for the more generous supporters of the game's Kickstarter campaign, physical Ekosi cards were produced.<br/><br/>Ekosi plays very similarly to Blackjack.  Each player is dealt cards by the dealer with the goal of getting as close to a combined value of 20 as possible without going over.  Players will either &quot;Hit&quot; or &quot;Stand&quot; on their turn until both players &quot;Stand&quot; or one player ends their turn with a combined value greater than 20, also known as a &quot;Bust&quot;.  If both players &quot;Stand&quot; at the same total, it is considered a tie and no points are awarded that round.<br/><br/>The key difference in Ekosi is that players also have cards in their hands that can be used to alter their point total during their turn.  There are four different color cards; green, blue, red and yellow.  Green cards are dealt by the dealer and always add to your point total each round.  Blue cards can be played from your hand to increase your point total.  Red cards can be played from your hand to decrease your point total.  Yellow cards can be played from your hand and have special properties such as doubling the last card dealt or allowing you to break a tie.<br/><br/>A standard Ekosi deck is made up of 72 cards.  There are 40 green cards which are separated and shuffled to become the Dealer's draw pile.  The remaining cards are shuffled and become the players' hand draw pile.  If you are just learning the basics, it is recommended to remove all the yellow cards prior to shuffling the players' hand draw pile.  Once you are comfortable with the core features of Ekosi, you can add the yellow cards in a future game.  This helps to keep learning Ekosi from becoming too intimidating or confusing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Color Fox you must collect as many sets of matches as possible. An ingenious game of strategy, observation and luck. Arrange the cards to match colors. Each matchstick you form earns a stick. Be the one with the most sets of sticks to win!<br/><br/>Step 1: 3 cards are dealt to each player (they are not shown to the rest), the rest of the cards are left in a discard pile face down and the colored sticks are placed within reach of all players. A card from the discard pile is played face up<br/><br/>Step 2: On their turn, each player must place one of the cards from their hand next to the cards in play so that the color of at least one matchstick matches. In doing so, he picks up a stick of that color. It is important that the cards always have the same orientation.<br/><br/>Step 3: Sort the sticks you have collected by sets of different colors (you cannot have the same color twice in the same set). A set can include up to 6 sticks. Count your score according to the rules of the game. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>En Color Fox debes coleccionar el m&aacute;ximo n&uacute;mero de sets de cerillas como te sea posible.

Se juega una carta del mazo de descarte boca arriba<br/><br/>Paso 2: En su turno, cada jugador debe poner una de las cartas de su mano al lado de las cartas que est&eacute;n en juego de forma que el color de, al menos, una cerilla coincidan.

        "description": "みんなのさいたマップ (Minna no Saitamap) is a co-operative game from Japan, based upon local knowledge of the Japanese city Saitama and the surrounding area.<br/><br/>Saitama lies just a little Northwest of Tokyo. The game was produced by a local game circle Wuerfel (ヴェルフェル) to celebrate Saitama's 150th birthday in 2021. It's intended to delight and inform players of the sites and life of Saitama. Whilst it helps to be a resident and know a bit about Saitama, the game is deliberately designed to be played by anybody. The design includes elements to win by developing unity, and to gain clues by spending points. However, the game is text heavy, so being able to read Japanese is needed.<br/><br/>Players take turns to play through the game, travelling around Saitama while getting to know Saitama's charms. As they do, the mascot characters, municipalities, tourist attractions and companies will appear one after another. To win the game, the players must reveal all the map cards making up Saitama, and to turn up five Unity cards that bring the residents together.<br/><br/>There are several types of cards in the box, map cards (the game title is a portmanteau of 'Saitama map'), Yura-chara cards (the local mascots), discovery cards (quizes on local stuff such as businesses), and Unity cards (which given special abilities). The game has 185 cards including high quality photographs from the region.<br/><br/>The map cards are used to lay out a plan of Saitama with four districts, North, East, West and Chichibu, three cards to each quarter (more for the advanced and demon levels). Players are dealt five Yura-Chura cards to their hand, which are used in gameplay but also have vital local information. By reading the cards, players can discover new things about Saitama which later will help them win the game.<br/><br/>Players start with their tokens in the centre of Saitama and move North/South by discarding one hand card, or East/West by discarding two. This reflects local transport in Saitama being easier North/South than East/West.<br/><br/>After moving, a player can turn over a map card by discarding Yura-chara cards with the matching symbols. But before turning a card over, the player must answer a quiz question on the card. Only the turn player can answer, but players can swap Yura-chara cards around, so passing the correct answer on.<br/><br/>Even if a player cannot answer the question, they turn the card over and read out the answer and other information about Saitama. The cards also have photographs taken especially for the game.<br/><br/>Players move a marker on a quiz qauge up or down if they got the answer right or wrong (they start at 5 out of 10). If the gauge hits zero, the player is eliminated from the game, for knowing nothing about the wonders of Saitama! (A player can also spend 3 points to count as a symbol needed to flip the card.)<br/><br/>After turning the map card and adjusting their gauge, the player turns up a Discovery card. This is another quiz, on local businesses, goods and retailers. Likewise, getting questions correct helps you proceed.<br/><br/>Finally, a player refills their hand to five and the next player goes.<br/><br/>During the game, a player might turn up a card saying &quot;Everyone United!&quot;. These Unity cards give special abilities to help players. But all five Unity cards must be revealed to win the game. Players spend hand cards to achieve this, working together.<br/><br/>The game is won by revealing all the map cards and Unity cards. If the deck of Yura-chara cards is exhausted, the game ends.<br/><br/>The game designer playtested the game with Tokyo residents and they had no trouble playing. But the designer also lost the game twice playing on the Intermediary level, despite being a resident and the designer of the game. The illustrator of the game is uncredited, but the designer credits the photographer on their blog.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Try this game and enjoy the thrill of the sport in a simplified and easy to understand way.<br/><br/>Free PNP game, original idea by Chris Hill <br/>Translated and adapted by @Ludoman<br/><br/>To play you just need a die, a score recording sheet, a pencil and 8 cards (5 attack and 3 defense). Strongly recommended also to print a football stadium so to control the plays.<br/><br/>12 plays in each quarter, 4 quarters per game. On each play, the offense and defense play a card and the offense rolls a die. To see the advance (or retreat), both cards and the die are compared on the board and the next down is played.<br/>If a 1 is rolled, the roll is repeated. If another 1, fumble! If a 6 is rolled, the roll is repeated, and if a 6 is rolled again, the yards gained are doubled... and the roll is repeated! Continue until no more 6's are rolled or a touchdown is scored.<br/>You can kick to put the ball away or to kick a field goal. You advance the number of yards resulting from the value of a die roll multiplied by 10. If you don't reach the distance from where you kick, the field goal is considered missed.<br/><br/><br/><br/>&iquest;Te apetece jugar un partido de f&uacute;tbol americano, pero sin llevarte golpes?

Se recomienda encarecidamente imprimir un estadio de f&uacute;tbol para controlar las jugadas.<br/><br/>12 jugadas en cada cuarto, 4 cuartos por partido. En cada jugada, el ataque y la defensa juegan una carta y el ataque tira un dado. Para ver el avance (o el retroceso) se comparan ambas cartas y el dado en la tabla y se juega el siguiente down.<br/>Si sale un 1, se repite la tirada, En caso de nuevo 1, fumble! Si se saca un 6, se repite la tirada y en caso de nuevo 6, se duplican las yardas obtenidas... y se vuelve a tirar!

Se avanza el n&uacute;mero de yardas resultante del valor de una tirada de dado multiplicado por 10. Si no se alcanza la distancia desde donde se lanza, se da por fallado el field goal.<br/><br/>",

The General Secretary guides the party faithful, guiding them to solve tasks, and purging the treacherous dissidents.<br/><br/>One player has the role of General Secretary and the rest are Ministers in the Government. As the game progresses, the dissidents are secretly trying to disrupt the progress of government by preventing issues from being solved. Their goal is to overthrow the Secretary and seize power. The Secretary and the loyal Ministers are trying to maintain control, and purge the rebels from the Party.<br/><br/>Players are dealt one of the 7 Position cards, identifying their role in the Party. The General Secretary is obviously loyal, and the Ministers each get a Faction card ($ loyal and 2 dissident). These set up the players approach to the party agenda.<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of rounds in which the General Secretary lays out the issues to be resolved by using Agenda cards (18 in the game). The Party members try to solve these issues with 49 Resource cards, representing Elements of the State such as the Armed Forces, Policies, Finance, Production, and party networks. There are 9 of each type plus 4 non-co-operation cards in the deck.<br/><br/>First, the Minister in charge of the Agenda reports on the Agenda. Then, the Ministers hold a meeting to discuss how to resolve the reported content. At that time, it would be a good idea to interrogate suspicious persons as dissidents. The General Secretary concludes by identifying the suspects on the basis of his superior talent. The suspects are purged from the party.<br/><br/>Each Minister also has special privileges from their position to help them resolve the issues on the Agenda. By working together and using the resource cards, the Ministers can resolve the issues facing the Party.<br/><br/>If the General Secretary is successful in completing the Agenda by resolving the issues, the Party faithful win. But if the Party cannot resolve the issues, the dissidents win.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

They add cards to fuel the fire, and then try to place their food at the right time to cook properly.<br/><br/>There are a variety of firewoods, which burn differently and give off more or less heat, such as oak, cedar, pine and so on. Players have potatoes, marshmallows, and meat in garlic to cook. By playing wood cards and food cards at the best times, they can cook their food best.<br/><br/>The game title translates roughly as &quot;Save Me! Before It Burns Out&quot;, meaning players have to time the fire so it doesn't go out before their food is done.<br/><br/>",

The tour operators complete demands by sliding different parts of the island closer together.<br/><br/>Hokkaido is a very large island to the North of Honshu, which is the largest island in the Japanese archipelago. But Hokkaido is nearly as large as Honshu, and has no Shinkansen (Bullet Train) either. The main cities and tourist sites in Hokkaido are far apart and hard to get around. Tourists can only use the local express trains.<br/><br/>But tourists are wanting to visit Sapporo, Hakodate, Kushiro in 3 days and 2 nights! So, obviously, Kushiro must be moved next to Sapporo! As a result, Hokkaido looks like a mess, but it's a small sacrifice if you can fulfill the customer's wishes.<br/><br/>In the game, the island's geography is divided up across a grid of square tiles. Players take turns, rolling three dice and moving the tiles around liking a sliding puzzle game. The tiles can be rotated (they have a marker in one corner to show the correct orientation). The player who can move their tourist around the required locations fastest scores points.<br/><br/>The game designer is from Hokkaido and in the game title 'Hankakusai' is a dialect of Hokkaido and means 'stupid' or 'ridiculous'.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

With each clash of their swords, a quarter of the Earth is destroyed. They draw on hunters and weapons to help them in their battle.<br/><br/>In this game, players use a variety of action cards to strengthen their position, and then settle the round with a rock-paper-scissors (RSP) contest (known in Japan as Janken). The first player to win three rounds is the ruler of Earth.<br/><br/>The game has a deck of cards, color-coded on the back so you know which is which; a support card (blue), a rock-paper-scissors card (yellow), or a weapon card (black). Players start a round with a hand of five cards. On their turn, a player draws a card from the deck, and may play one or two action cards, and then pass their turn. After both players have had a turn, if they both have a yellow card in hand, then a RSP test takes place. The players shuffle their hand cards and draw one at random. If this resolves a RSP, one player collects a scoring marker, and the cards are all reshuffled for a new round. If there is no RSP resolved, the start player marker switches to the other player and the game resumes.<br/><br/>The action cards give various benefits, such as drawing extra cards, or reclaiming a card from the discard and so on. Ultimately, a player is trying to determine which yellow cards their opponent holds, so that they might win the RSP contest. The game is more tactical than luck, and players are allowed to check the colours of the cards in the draw deck.<br/><br/>The game also includes some extra cards that allow variants to be played, including an undersea city and demons and devils.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

It was artificial state of balance and natural magic flow usage was restricted. Their folks lived in peace and the magic was inherited through the dynasties of each of these 7 founders.<br/><br/>But they have missed one thing. Balance was kept for thousands of years, but it was not perfect. There were one aspect of magic, which could not be used for keeping the balance, the most dark, unpredictable and chaotic energy.<br/><br/>This magic energy aspect accumulated over the years, becoming stronger, requesting more effort from the seven powers. The heirs of kings noticed to problem but suspecting each other from breaching the balance to increase their own potential profit. Finally the inhabitants started to feel the problems themselves. The magic used originally for comfort of the citizens were needed more to keep the borders. Reality breaches started to appear frequently.<br/><br/>The heirs of original seven emperors did not manage to keep people content. Heretic voices raised about connecting the worlds back together.  However nobody knew what's exactly going on.<br/><br/>One day the massive amount of chaotic energy accumulated for millenias bursted out like gigantic flood from a dam and caused reality breaches that crushed all artificial boundaries. The energy started to flow uncontrollably and magic abilities started to appear randomly through the population.<br/><br/>There is nobody in control and world is balancing on the edge of chaos. Who can combine the aspects of mystic energy to estabilish a peace and gather the mightiest army to conquer the new world?<br/><br/>The game contains 120 cards, 15 cards from each of eight colors representing the elements.

It is your job to blend in without your non human traits ruining the party. Since all guests are in costume, it shouldn't be too hard to blend in! All you have to do is act human, which we all know how to do right?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/><br/>You are not a human, but you like human things like small talk and parties. You and some of your other non-human friends decide to dress up as humans and attend a human party. However, your non-human quirks show up at the most inconvenient times. Try to make your way through the party without it getting too out of hand.<br/><br/>3-8 players gamify small talk in this larp, improvisation, awkward game of trying to not show your true self.

Players are walking around town trying to avoid stepping on dog poo on the pavement.<br/><br/>The game has 41 cards. Some are poo cards, some are score cards and some score cards have special actions. The deck is shuffled and the cards are all laid out face-down. They can be set out how you like, in a grid, in a loose mess, anyway you like as long as they are laid out separately.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they take a card and look at it secretly. Then they choose to put it back face-down, or to keep it. If they keep it, and it is a poo card, it goes face-down in front of them and has no benefit. If it is a score card, it goes face-up and if it is a special action, that takes effect.<br/><br/>If the player puts the card back, it goes back face-down. The other players now have a chance to challenge the turn player, calling out Unko Funda! if they do. The card is turned up. If the card is poo, the turn player is eliminated from the game and scores zero at the end. The player who called out Unko Funda! keeps the poo card face up in front of themself, and it scores 2 points at the end.<br/><br/>But if the card is not a poo card, the turn player collects it face up, and the challenger is eliminated. So as players draw and play cards face down, they trying to bluff each other whether or not the card was poo.<br/><br/>Players use a mix of bluff, deduction and knowing what cards they have seen to work out if the card played is poo or not.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the players still in the game calculate their scores, and the most points wins.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The game uses a sock-Scissors-paper mechanism (called Janken in Japan), but the winner is the first person to clear their hand.<br/><br/>The game has 9 yellow and 9 white cards, and 3 black cards, showing rock/scissors/paper evenly. However, the white cards show the RSP on both sides, giving information to the opponents. And if a player wins a round with a black card, that card is picked up by the loser.<br/><br/>The game is for 3 to 7 players, and card distribution varies according to the number of players. But players end up with a random selection of cards in hand. Cards are held so that opponents can see clearly who has what colour cards in hand.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player nominates another to battle. The players call out Rock Scissors Paper PON! as a 1-2-3-Go! call, and play their card immediately on the final shout.<br/><br/>If the battle is won, the winner sheds their winning card, unless it was a black card in which case the loser collects it to their hand. The loser collects their losing card back into their hand, and the turn moves to the next player after the turn player.<br/><br/>When one player has cleared their hand, they win.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The game can be played as a competitive game for a single winner by scoring victory points, or as a co-operative game trying to stop the escaping magical creatures. The main rules apply for both games and the co-op game can be played solo.<br/><br/>The game has a subtitle ～ジェレミア魔法学校の訓練法～(~Jeremiah Magic School Training Method~).<br/><br/>Players use dice to place against three actions: Activating Magic, Movement, and Student Skills.<br/><br/>By placing dice against the six different magic circuit cards, a player can gain magic spells from them. Magic is used when attacking other players, or the creatures. Dice used on the magic broom of a student allows the player to move that witch across the playing field. Each student has special skills which are used once per round with the dice.<br/><br/>The game ends after six rounds. Players need to balance the development of their students, combining attack and defence, and movement and growth of skills. The more a student develops, the more they can achieve by the final round.<br/><br/>In a 2 player game, each player controls two witches. In a co-operative game, players can pass on good dice rolls. In the competitive game, getting to be start player gives you advantages.<br/><br/>The second edition released in 2022 had improved components and box art, but the gameplay was the same.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

However, before beginning their description, the player must also roll a 1d6 &quot;forfeit die&quot;, the result of which affects what they may say to their teammates. For example: a '1' means the player may only speak in the past tense; a '2' means the player may only use words of six or fewer letters; a '6' means the player may only speak in rhyme; and so forth.<br/><br/>Teams score a point if their player can adhere to the forfeit conditions and the teammates guess the topic. If the player does not adhere to their forfeit, the opposing team may hit the buzzer and score a point, and also end that player's turn. If the player's teammates are unable to guess the topic, the opposing team has one guess. If correct, they win a point, if not, no points are scored.<br/><br/>A bonus point may be scored if the player adheres to their forfeit and manages to avoid saying &quot;um&quot; or &quot;er&quot;, even if their team does not correctly guess the topic.<br/><br/>Play then passes to the opposing team. The first team to reach ten points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It is a city-scale game that simulates the development of railway Systems, passenger and freight routes, and industries roughly during the period 1870 to 1930.<br/><br/>It generally follows traditional 18xx rules borrowed from 1830. There are stock rounds where shares are bought and sold, and operating rounds where tracks are laid, stations placed, and trains run for revenue.  Some parts from 1830 are necessary to play the game.<br/><br/>Rather than laying tiles, players draw track sections and place station tokens with their companies' colored sharpies to both indicate completion and ownership.  Companies can lease track from other players to complete their routes<br/><br/>The revenue values of hexes increase as game phases change and industries &quot;pop-up&quot; in those hexes at the end of each operating round from a pre-programmed chain of industry tokens.<br/><br/>As with traditional 18xx, players' portfolio and cash holdings determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

'Gakuen' is high school, and 'Ren-aikinshi' is the rule talent agencies apply to their stars forbidding personal relationships (because they think it deters the fans). So the game tile means a love-ban at high school. In this game, a player must find the one they are destined to fall in love with. The player count is 5 to 9, because of the minimum five roles in the game.<br/><br/>Set in a school where romance is prohibited, the goal is to fulfill the love between the main character and the destined person. However, if the disciplinary committee among the students finds out about the relationship, there is a danger of expulsion.<br/><br/>Players have five roles:<br/>1. Protagonist looking for a destined person<br/>2. A person destined to do his best to be confessed to by the main character<br/>3. A friend who supports the main character and the destined person<br/>4. If confessed to by the main character, the only rival<br/>5. A disciplinary committee member who finds the person of destiny and expels him from school<br/><br/>Only the main character's role is revealed, and the identity of the other players is unknown.<br/><br/>Using the prepared character cards and combination attribute cards, you will play a role and perform events that are common in school things. Even if you know the other player's identity, the only way to tell it to the main character is through role-playing.<br/><br/>Depending on their role, each player has a different win condition.<br/><br/>An expansion pack was published later.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

German forces thunder into the snow-covered Ardennes forest, opposed only by a few exhausted Allied troops as German armor and infantry forces raced across the allied lines and into the countryside.  The Allied player is in a desperate struggle to hold the front line and repel the all-out German offensive.<br/><br/>&quot;Point Blank Winter Victory&quot; is an expansion module for Lock 'n Load Publishing tactical World War 2 squad card &quot;Point Blank V is for Victory.&quot; &quot;Point Blank Winter Victory&rdquo; is for 1-2 players and adds exciting new combat units, such as the German Tiger II, more famously known as the King Tiger tank, and the American M4A3 tank.  New terrain and objective cards and been included expanding already on the large terrain types in the game.  &quot;Point Blank Winter Victory&rdquo; takes you out of the dog days of summer and leaves players to contend with freezing weather with our added new snow and fog rules.  Each of the 12 new scenarios included presents the players with a unique situation involving squads of men, support weapons, leaders, and individual armored fighting vehicles.<br/><br/>This game pits the forces of the Allied and German forces against each other in the frozen Ardennes forest during the Battle of the Bulge. Each player has victory conditions determined by the scenario in which to defend or take objectives, seek and destroy their opponent&rsquo;s units, or one of many other different scenario objectives.<br/><br/>The game is played on an abstract map board made up of terrain cards in the game and managed through a distance system that accounts for the range to targets, line of sight, and defensive attributes. The player has units that start out on the map and gradually work their way towards their objectives by advancing through the battlefield, all the while conducting combat actions against their opponent or defending their troops from return fire or whatever hell awaits them. Players draw cards from a common action deck where they will play actions on their units on the map board. The game is an IGOUGO impulse system, and turns are managed when the action deck is exhausted. (Some scenarios may require multiple deck exhaustion to finish the game). Actions in the game consist of Fire, Move, Assault, Rally, etc. The action cards contain dice icons on them to determine random results.<br/><br/>One of the unique features of the game is that it contains a deck of terrain cards that are not part of the action deck. As players change terrain, they will draw a terrain card in which their moving units will occupy. Some action cards, such as Recon, help players manage what terrain they occupy, but your opponent may have other plans for your moving troops during their turn.<br/><br/>The game can be played in about an hour (depending on the scenario size), and if you cannot find an opponent, then try the game solo system. In general, the gameplay is fast and exciting and compares to such legendary game systems as Up Front.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&bdquo;&hellip;three, two, one&hellip; ready or not, here I come!&ldquo; Cute animals in the forest are playing hide-and-seek, looking for the best hiding place. Can you find them all? Hide-and-seek is designed for players up from the age of three. There are several difficulty levels to choose from.<br/><br/>Goal of the game is collect as many animal cards as you can.<br/><br/>One player is a seeker. Seeker chooses six yellow animal cards and puts them picture up on the starting squares called HOME BASE. Then he shuffles all the blue animal cards and put the pack on the CARD PACK square.<br/><br/>He turns the cards on the starting squares face down. He moves individual yellow cards randomly from the starting squares to the hiding squares (HOLLOW, NEST, ANTHILL, BEEHIVE, THICKET, STONES, TREE STUMP) on the board. One of the squares will remain empty.<br/><br/>Now all the players take turns, clockwise. At the beginning of their turn, each player turns the blue animal card on the top of the pack. Then he takes an attempt to find the same animal on a yellow card hidden on the board.<br/><br/>If he succeeds, he keeps the pair.<br/>If not, he returns the blue card to the bottom of the pack and places the yellow card on an empty hiding square of his own choice back face down.<br/>If a player thinks that the animal is not currently hidden on the board, he announces this, puts the blue card face down in front of himself and takes a new one. Then he try to find the matching yellow card for the new animal. (BUT! the players get two penalty points on the end of the round, for every animal which is eliminated this way and yet its matching yellow card is found to be hiding on the board.)<br/><br/>Once all the hiding animals are successfully matched, the players count the cards they won and note the corresponding number of their points. This closes one round of the game.<br/><br/>The number of rounds corresponds to the number of players.<br/>Players with the most of points on the end of all rounds of the game is winner.<br/><br/>",

Clash is a simple and easy game to play with some level of strategy involved.<br/><br/>The game starts with each player setting up a defense, after which they have to destroy each other&rsquo;s defenses and then beat each other out in a duel. The last player standing wins the game.<br/><br/>The game consists of attack cards with different numbers, as well as 5 different action cards. The attack cards are primarily used to attack the opponents, whereas the action cards have different functions.<br/><br/>Gameplay (How to play):<br/><br/><br/>     Shuffle the deck<br/>     Deal 8 random cards to each player.<br/>     All players set up 3 Defense cards, which leaves 5 cards in hand.<br/>     In turn, use the Attack cards to destroy enemy defenses and use the Action cards to turn the tide of the battle to your advantage.<br/>     The game is played in a clockwise direction and the person to the left of the dealer starts the game.<br/>     All players will in turn try to destroy each other&rsquo;s defenses.<br/>         Players are allowed to perform up to 2 moves (plays) when it&rsquo;s their turn as long as the moves are not of the same card type. E.g. it&rsquo;s not allowed to play 2 Attack cards or 2 Action cards, but instead, playing an Action card followed by an Attack card is allowed.<br/>         Use the Action cards to turn the tide of the game to your advantage<br/>         Attack enemy defenses and destroy them all<br/>         When the opportunity comes, reinforce your defense<br/>    <br/>     When a player loses all 3 Defense cards, then the player may be challenged by other players to a duel. The duel is carried out by both the duel initiator (the attacker) and the player with no defenses left (the defender) playing an attack card faced down, after which both cards are revealed at the same time.<br/>         If the defender's card is weaker than the attacker's card, then the duel is lost and the defender is out of the game.<br/>         If the defender's card is stronger than the attacker's card, then the duel is won and the defender is rewarded with +1 new Defense card (placed from the cards in hand). The defender gets to continue the game.<br/>    <br/>     The last player remaining wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
