        "description": "Chapter &amp; Verse requires players to connect hexagonal tiles they have drawn to tiles in the play area in a manner similar to Dominos. To connect tiles players must match the numbers on the edge of the tiles played with the number on the tiles it will be connecting to. Some of the tiles have olive branches on their edges instead of numbers. Olive branches must connect to other olive branches. Since there are many olive branches, they make it easier to connect tiles.  There are also wild tiles that have edges that may count as any number or an olive branch. One other way tiles can be matched is if the player is able to combine the tiles to create one of the three verses on the Message Card he was given at the beginning of the game. For example, a player may have the verse Matthew 5:16 on his message card. He could connect a tile with 16 on one of its edges to a tile that has Matthew in its center and 5 on one its edges to create Matthew 5:16. <br/>The objective of the game is for the players to create all three verses on their message cards and use the clues in those verses to guess the secret word on the other side of the card. The first player to create all three verses and guess his secret word is the winner. Even if a player can guess the secret word before they complete all three of the verses he must complete the other verses to win.<br/><br/>The following is from the back of the box - An archeologist, Dr. S needs your help to decipher and uncover secret words. He needs assistance sifting through ancient tiles and linking them together to gain clues to a message. Dr. S has started a Log Book detailing the links between the tiles. According to the legend, when you recreate the messages using the ancient tiles you will uncover clues to a secret word(s). Find the tiles, build the links, read the writings and claim your reward of wisdom, one word at a time.<br/><br/>",

A fun and challenging list game!<br/>Packed with 80 entertaining Strike Off list cards, plus rules.<br/><br/>To play the game, you draw a card, read a question on it and the next player tries to list as many items that would answer the question as he/she can. I.e., if a card asks &quot;There have been 6 James Bond actors - name them&quot;, the following player would earn a point for each correctly named actor, and additional STRIKE OFF bonus of one point if they name all 6. The first player to reach 15 points wins.<br/><br/>Alternatively, players can divide into teams or if they prefer longer or shorter game, they may agree on a different points total at the start of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The first to gain 42 followers is the winner! Gain Followers by sending Disciples on Mission Trips. Have a Preach-Off to take out an enemy. Defend against enemy Disciples with Agnostics. Beef up, slow down, or mess with the guys in play using Blessings, Curses, and Miracles. Baby Jesus, the scorekeeper, also has super powers.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>All cards that you play or actions that you take happen on your own turn, in any order that you like.<br/><br/>Communion Wafers are the currency for this game. The number on the top left of a card is how many wafers it costs to play. On the first turn you can only spend one wafer. The second turn you have two to spend. By the time the third turn comes around&hellip; You guessed it! 3 wafers! And so on. Spend them wisely and you will dominate. As the game goes on, things get very exciting because you are able to play more powerful cards. If you lose track of how many wafers you have available: Smoke less weed or keep track with dice. Your choice but the author prefers the latter.<br/><br/>Each player starts with their Baby Jesus to the right of their deck, to help keep score. Slide a paper clip around Baby Jesus and when you get to 42 Followers, you become the winner, but more importantly - they become the loser. Baby Jesus' Super Powers help keep the game moving and are great for using up excess wafers. Only one Relic may be played on Baby Jesus at a time and may be used to damage an enemy once per turn. When it has been exhausted, it is sent to hell, a warm cozy place to the left of your deck.<br/><br/>Besides Baby Jesus and his Relics, there are two main types of cards:<br/><br/>1) Character cards<br/><br/>Characters have Attack and Defense. This is how they compete with each other. If their Defense reaches zero, they are sent straight to hell. During a Mission Trip, Followers are gained equal to the Disciple&rsquo;s Attack number.<br/><br/>Agnostics - Defenders who keep your opponent from gathering Followers. If your enemy has an Agnostic in play, you must send it to hell before your Disciples can go on a Mission Trip or have a Preach-Off against a non-Agnostic.<br/>Disciples - Offenders who may either be sent on a Mission Trip or have a Preach-Off once per turn. Without gaining Followers, you cannot win so it usually makes more sense to go on a Mission Trip. If you do elect to have a Preach-Off this is how it works: You choose the character you would like to Preach off against (remember, Agnostics must be targeted first). Defense points are deducted from both characters equal to the attack points of the opposing character. This happens at the same time. So, if a 1/5 (1 Attack, 5 Defense) dude attacks a 2/1 enemy, the enemy will perish and your Disciple is now a 1/3 [mark damage taken with pennies]. Moreover, it might be a smart move to sacrifice a 1/1 against an 8/1 to take him out of commision.<br/><br/>2) Manipulation cards<br/><br/>Unless otherwise stated, Blessings and Curses affect only one character. These cards may stay in play to help keep track of who they have an effect on. Whenever they become irrelevant, feel free to toss them into the fiery pit.<br/><br/>Blessings - Turn your dudes into badasses.  <br/>Curses - Mess with your enemies.  <br/>Miracles - Save these for when you could really use one.<br/><br/>Now let's begin:<br/><br/>The game starts with each player shuffling their own deck and drawing 4 cards. Good cards to start with cost 1 or 2 wafers; you will be able to use them sooner. If you aren't happy with your hand, you may shuffle the cards you don't like back into the deck and replace them. You may do this twice. If you still don't like your hand, too bad. You'll draw a new card every turn so don't make a big fuss about it. Now flip a coin. The winner chooses to either go first (starting with just the 4 cards they have) or draw first.<br/><br/>Alternative 4 player version (2-Headed-Jesus): Each team helps one Baby Jesus attract 84 followers. Each player has their own deck. Make your moves at the same time as your teammate. Help each other out. You may look at each other&rsquo;s hands to help strategize.<br/><br/>Remember to have fun. Because if you're not having fun... What's the point?<br/><br/>",

The branch is going to go through some significant downsizing and can only keep one employee on board. This can be accomplished through hard work, brown nosing the boss, sabotaging co-workers, or a combination of the three.<br/><br/>Each player starts out with three Idea cards which can be played for points or effects, and three Supplies cards which can be used to play Idea cards. The object of the game is to collect more points than your co-workers by the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each Idea card consists of an Employee side with an effect, a cost, and a point value; and a Boss side which contains a Boss effect. During a turn, an employee can take two actions. These actions may include playing an Idea card with Supplies card, discarding an Idea card to gain two more Supplies cards, or drawing a new Ideas card from the deck.<br/><br/>After each round of game play, however, the Boss decides to complicate things with an idea of his own. This is done by drawing an Idea card from the top of the deck. The Boss side action is then used as an effect for the subsequent round of game play. After the Boss action is applied to the new round, the boss moves to the right, and the player who started the last round begins the new round. The game ends when the Boss runs out of ideas (when an Idea card can no longer be drawn during the Boss's turn.)<br/><br/>",

Two playing pieces and a blockade piece are randomly placed on three intersections, and a sand timer or stopwatch counts 60 seconds. In that time, players have to find a route from one playing piece to the other that goes through as many houses as possible, while making no more than four turns. They have to write down that number of houses before the time runs out. <br/>The player with the highest number shows their path first - if successful, they get that number and everyone else gets whatever they wrote without being checked. If the highest player fails, they get two points less than the lowest player and the second highest shows their path, etc. So bluffing is encouraged, as long as you don't bid too high. <br/>First player to reach 55 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Not That Funny is a tabletop game designed to uncover the damaging truths behind everyday jokes and microaggressions directed at marginalized groups and individuals. A minimum of three players are needed to play this game.<br/><br/>Each player should select seven Response Cards to start, and should always have that amount before the start of each round. Each player selects one Time-Out Card at the start of the game, and keeps it handy in case the game gets a little too fiery.<br/><br/>The shortest person will start the game as the &quot;selector.&quot;  After each round, the person to the selector's right will take on that duty&mdash;and so on, until the game ends. The selector chooses one Situation Card from the top of the deck at the start of the round, and reads it out loud. Then, each player picks the Response Card they think fits best, and discreetly hands it over to the selector. The selector chooses &quot;the best&quot; Response Card, and that player is awarded one point.<br/><br/>If the chosen card is an NTF (Not That Funny) Response Card, another point is up for grabs.  All players EXCEPT the player that laid the NTF card can attempt to explain to the selector why the phrase is harmful or problematic. The selector decides which of the explanations is the most accurate, and awards that player a bonus point. If the selector determines that none of the players were able to answer correctly, the player that laid the NTF Response Card will be awarded the extra point.<br/><br/>The best way to keep score is to return the winning Response Card and NTF Response Card to the player that earned the point. We suggest 10 points to win the game. However, you can choose a higher or lower point goal depending on how long you want to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Get to know the history of Savonlinna and its environs through playing&quot;<br/><br/>In this Afrikan T&auml;hti-like Finnish game centered on the eastern Finland city of Savonlinna, players travel around the town both on land and on lake Saimaa, flipping tokens that can either help or hinder them on the way, in search of the one special Note Key token; whenever a player finds this, a race back to the town begins, and the one to get there first is the winner. Main differences to Afrikan T&auml;hti besides the map are that some of the tokens have longer-lasting and more powerful effects, the lack of flight routes, and that there is no &quot;Horseshoe&quot; piece that would be required to win at the end instead of the &quot;Star&quot;, it is a simple race.<br/><br/>Modern history of Savonlinna begins in 1475 when the Olavinlinna castle was built on a small island in the strategic Kyr&ouml;nsalmi strait on lake Saimaa, guarding what was then the eastern border of the Swedish empire. The settlement that sprung up nearby got town rights in 1639. The Note Key is an obvious reference to what Savonlinna is internationally most famous for; the Savonlinna Opera Festival, held annually each July. The back of the rules sheet gives a short description of the major attractions and landmarks in and around the city.<br/><br/>",

It plays like regular UNO matching color and number, but if a Dare Card is played, the player must decide if they are willing to risk doing the dare versus the penalty of drawing cards. There are four levels of dares: mild, medium, spicy, and fuego!  A chance roll of the die determines which dare players must perform. A card with a &ldquo;reverse&rdquo; icon on it forces the player who played the Dare Card to perform the dare! But the party doesn't end there, these cards are durable, waterproof plastic cards to make them completely spill-proof and comes with a handy clip to keep them together!

The player who has number 2, of the same suit places it in front of himself. Then the player with number 3, etc. until all twelve cards in that suit have been played. The cards are played end to end toward the market in the center of the table. The player who plays number 12 then starts a new suit with number 1 if he has it, if not the next player to his left who has number 1 starts by placing it beside the first card which he played.

Each team consists of 6 players (generic pawns); one pawn at a time is used to move the puck with 2d6, trying to get to one of the shooting positions in order to score - but the puck can only stay with the same pawn for one turn, after which it must be passed. Opposing pawns will naturally try to capture it on their own turn. Some points on the board will trigger an event card which can be good or bad; the designer suggests that this is an 'advanced variant' and the first few games should be played without.<br/><br/>The game ends when a pre-agreed number of goals have been scored; in a tournament game, the losing teams and the winning teams will meet each other, and the one to score the most goals wins.<br/><br/>",

The folding gameboard was made of sheet metal. A metal container accompanying the board served both as a container for the pieces and as a dice cup.

Players choose from five evil megacorporations to rule over twenty comically named oil-bearing countries (Suxembourg, Liceland, Petropolis).  All the corporations share a common oil trading route (&quot;the pipeline&quot;) that runs through the countries, so the trick is to put as little good product into the pipeline while pulling out as much refined material as possible. Players export product, collect dividends and pillage to collect oil tokens which have negative and positive values. Once a corporation goes bankrupt, the game ends, and the player with the most valuable oil hoard wins.  Optional rules adjust the length and style of the game from short and cutthroat to long and sneaky.<br/><br/>",

Using GoBot strategy, players vie for position as they flip playing pieces from robot to vehicle, in pursuit of the mobile target.  The first player to travel the maze-like course and reach and control Command Center, wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>GoBots game is a relatively simple spin &amp; move game where players race around the board trying to reach the Command Center first.   Players can transform their characters from robot to vehicle mode by laying them flat, which allows them to travel more quickly around the perimeter of the board using the larger spaces.   Movement on the spinner ranges from 1-5, while the &quot;6&quot; space causes the Command Center to move instead of the player's character.   This can be used to move it closer to their location and/or further from opponents.<br/><br/>The goal is to be the first to reach the Command Center.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s bad enough to fight giant reptiles &ndash; fighting drug-crazed giant reptiles is absolutely the worst.<br/><br/>Dinosaur: 1944 is a cooperative strategy game about army men vs. prehistoric monsters. In it, you and up to 3 other players control brave soldiers in a World War II setting, struggling to save the entire world from the threat of a Mesozoic rebirth. It is in part a battle game, as you maneuver around the map and fight the enemy. It is in part tower defense, as you place ambushes to help take out or slow down the incoming fiends. Each hero has unique strengths and weaknesses &ndash; your victory depends both in mastering your own hero and cooperating with your friends.  As the game progresses, you face more numerous foes, and dinosaur bosses enter the field. Eventually, you face the final boss &ndash; defeating her wins the game.

        "description": "Kamelipeli (The Camel Game) is an abstract tile placement game for the whole family published by the UNICEF association of Finland (maybe in the eighties or early nineties?). The rules recommend an even number of players.<br/><br/>The game includes a fairly large thin cardboard showing a two-colour drawing of the African continent filled with squares (135 of them). Some of the squares have names of African countries in them but this has no effect on gameplay. Similarly highlighted are some areas of severe drought (namely the Sahel area).<br/><br/>The game is played with event cards and two types of small squares of thin cardboard. One set of tiles is blue on the other side (water) and green of the other (vegetation). The second set is brown on the other side (drought) and on the reverse there can be one of three different pictures of a camel (or a note: pick up an event card).<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of placing a brown tile on the map, checking the size of the camel on the other side and either leaving it there, swapping it for a blue tile, flipping a blue tile green or picking up an event card and following its instructions.<br/><br/>An example of an event card: &quot;Measles is a very serious disease among African children. You are vaccinating children against it. You may remove one brown tile from the board.&quot;<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to build a continuous green line of tiles across Africa. All players build this line together, but the winner is the one who places the last green tile to connect two opposing coasts. A slightly longer game has the players trying to fill at least half of the map with green tiles (the winner again placing the last one).<br/><br/>",

Players are either sprites or viruses trying to protect or infect the CPU where they all live. The board is a circle of paths. Players roll and move, collecting 6 chips to win their goal, with Quantum shakes as hit points, magnets, Vid-windows, modems, and so on. The graphic design is strong, the rules written in a very modern style, following the computing theme very heavily for a kids' game, down to having a whole flow-chart on the back page! The board in the English-only version is thin cardboard which fan-folds into a wedge. (The English/French version uses a more traditional gameboard, and has a longer box to accommodate it.)<br/><br/>There is a production error in the tokens in the English-only version; you'll need to add markings to some of the tokens if 5 or 6 people are playing. (The English/French version only supports up to 4 players, but the English-only version was intended to support up to 6.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "'Rainy day cricket' is a game in the 'big fun in a little box' series by Tobar Ltd. Like other games in the series, it comes in a large matchbox-like container and has a nice miniature scoring pad and pencil. The main equipment are a green die bearing: bowled, run out, L.B.W., not out, no ball, caught; and a yellow die bearing: 1,2,3,4,6 and appeal.<br/><br/>From the instructions:<br/><br/>&quot;Rainy day cricket  (2 players)<br/><br/>Choose your teams and list their names on the scoresheet. Toss a coin and decide who will 'bat' first. The batting player uses the YELLOW die and will throw either 1,2,3,4,6 or APPEAL. If a number is thrown, record the score against the player in to bat.<br/><br/>If APPEAL is thrown, the bowling player uses the GREEN die and will throw LBW, CAUGHT, BOWLED, STUMPED (sic), NO BALL OR NOT OUT. If LBW, CAUGHT, BOWLED or STUMPED is thrown, the player batting is out and the next player on the list comes into bat.<br/><br/>If NO BALL or NOT OUT is thrown, the batting player carries on throwing the YELLOW dice as above.<br/><br/>If NO BALL is thrown, an 'extra' is also added to the batting team's score.<br/><br/>The batting team's innings is over when all eleven players are out.<br/><br/>The other team then bats.<br/><br/>The winning team is the one that scores the most runs in one innings.<br/><br/>A time/throws limit can be set if required. The game can also be varied to introduce more of the elements of a real cricket match if the players are enthusiastic enough!&quot;<br/><br/>(Grammatical errors have been corrected)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Mortality is an uplifting LDS board game about life rather than strictly a &quot;church&quot; game. It isn't made to teach a list of &quot;facts&quot; about the gospel. Instead, gospel principles are woven into the very fabric of the game. It doesn't give any advantage to the scriptorians or historians. Succeeding at the game requires cooperation, caring for other players, knowing how to build a solid foundation in one's youth, and an understanding of how faith and testimony help you endure trials, and any player who approaches the game in this manner can win.<br/><br/>The game is great at fostering friendly interaction among the players. Even the losers enjoy it, because they tend to end up being the focus of charitable efforts by the other players. Succeeding at the game requires strategy, luck, and advance planning. It teaches LDS values, including the importance of building a foundation that will withstand the adversities of life, the value that hardships can have in building testimony, and the benefits of selfless service. Yes, there is competition in Mortality, because there is a winner, and that's a big part of the entertainment value. But a great part of the fun is in the joking that surrounds the dealing together with experiences and trials in the game that are so much a part of life, but are presented in a somewhat humorous way.<br/><br/>Mortality takes about an hour to an hour-and-a-half to play, depending on the experience and luck of the players. It requires a minimum of three players and up to six can play. Young children can be helped to play the game, but truly understanding it requires an age of at least eight.<br/><br/>You start the game in the childhood section. Here you gain points or &quot;Testimonies&quot; as they are called, strictly by chance, based on what your family does. From there you enter the youth section. As a youth, you begin making decisions on your own that can help you later on or be a detriment to your later progress. You can serve as an LDS missionary, go on dates, and either get a civil marriage or a temple marriage. Avoiding a civil marriage may require some careful advance planning in order to avoid landing on the &quot;civil marriage&quot; square. From there you move into the adult section. One player gets to be the bishop. This assignment may pass from player to player depending on what happens in the game. As you move around in the adult section, you encounter trials of faith. Depending on how many Testimonies you already have, these trials can hurt you or help you. You also have an opportunity to help other players, for which you will gain even more Testimonies. The first player with 150 Testimonies &quot;finishes mortality&quot; and is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to create the tallest possible face by selecting and assembling different face tiles. When it is their turn, players roll the dice and select a face tile corresponding to the colour or part of the face shown on the dice, and add it to their face under construction. When a player has completed a face, there may still be room to improve it before everyone else has finished theirs, and the game is over. However, the first player to complete a face on an entirely red background or a 'rainbow' face where each tile has a different background colour, wins immediately.<br/><br/>",

One player is designated &quot;One Who Knows&quot; and has special powers (an extra card deck). <br/>There are clear parallels with Clue/Cluedo here, but with quite different (and more complex) turn mechanics.<br/>Although designated 2-6 players, it's really designed for 4 players, with variant rules provided for 2,3,5 and 6 players.<br/>Contents: Average sized board with ballroom design; 24 character pieces (5cm high card-in-stand figures) and correspondingly 24 Suspect cards; 121 Harlequin cards (actions); 21 Clue cards; 5 Thief cards; 11 &quot;One Who Knows&quot; cards; and two dice.

        "description": "Knuckle Knipper is a game of tension, memory, and frustration.<br/><br/>Each plastic 'Knipper' can be depressed from two sides.  Press one side and 'Ouch' - it snaps shut around your finger.  Press the other side and it refuses to snap.<br/><br/>Playing this game needs 'steady nerves', a good memory, and an element of bluff.  Players make their way from the centre of the board to their home corner by throwing the dice.  The route is of their choosing.<br/><br/>Each time a player stops he must depress the side of the Knuckle Knipper nearest his spot.  If it's safe, he may rest easy - if it 'snaps' he loses a finger card.  But he does get to re-set the 'Knipper' secretly so that no one else knows which side it will 'snap'.  That's where the memory comes in.  Players successfully reaching their own corner get a finger card back each time.<br/><br/>This fast and furious game of tension is for 2 to 4 players, the winner being the player who is the last with a finger or fingers intact.<br/><br/>",

A pawn on the right number of the right colour wins the bet times 2, a pawn on the right number but wrong colour gives wins the bet times 1, and a pawn on a completely wrong space wins nothing and loses the bet also. Multipliers are cumulative, so the maximum is 4, if all three dice show the same number and the player has his pawn on that very number.<br/><br/>The game includes 100 chips of three different denominations, for use in betting. Each player starts with 10 &quot;marks&quot;, minimum bet is 1 mark, and the game ends when there are no more chips in the bank.<br/><br/>The rules actually suggest a gambling variant for adults, where the players &quot;buy&quot; the starting chips with real cash to form a bank which is then shared between the players in relation to the value of the chips they won during the game.<br/><br/>",

It all starts with one Star for each player, and the goal is to invest your Stellar resources in the smartest strategic ways to build planets, then cultures that help grow your consciousness across the Galaxy! This is not a &quot;typical space opera shoot-em-up&quot; type game. Katalyka's system uses 'by the turn' customisable visual reference chart for deployment of Stellar resources into a full range of different gameplay styles. To truly master the Galaxy, you have to do more than just build space ships and lasers, in fact... right now those are relatively unimportant advancements in this game.<br/><br/>The gameplay is similar to a cross between Risk and Magic The Gathering.<br/><br/>Play should only take a few minutes to learn how to play, but the complexity of the strategic possibility increases nearly exponentially as the gameplay deepens.  There are 13 different types of interactions possible when interacting with an opponent, each of these pathways offers a different style of gameplay, and each one has been mastered by a different culture of the Galaxy.  Each group has different weaknesses and strengths, and can be seen as a hero, or a villain... depending on your game strategy.<br/><br/>Learn trade and master transportation in The Circle of Life, master data archiving and planetary engineering in The Order of the Singularity, and befriend multidimensional predators or hire anarchist hackers in The Forgotten... as you try to build a culture rich enough to become a member of The Elite, mysterious beings with capabilities and resources spanning every level of life.<br/><br/>This is a game unlike most others. I agree with those who said that a good strategy game takes minutes to learn and a lifetime to master. There are elements of this system that I have been working on developing for over two decades.<br/>I think that the loss of magic and mystery we experience with some of our scientific observations may be restored, and a more healthy balance of life can be found through respecting the Macro Organic life and finding new ways to interact with them... also learning to respect the old ways in a new light.<br/><br/>This manual is divided into two sections, the quick start section (for those who want to just dive right in and start playing), and the Galactic Primer (for those of you who enjoy learning about the deeper backstory of the Universe of Katalyka).<br/><br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Slapjack is a simple children's boardgame that appears to be related to, but distinct from, the Slap Jack card game...<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game all 44 cards are dealt face down to the players. (These are kept face down during the course of the game.) Players use a spinner to move cardboard pawns around a board. Each space has an instruction for the player to follow. Some spaces ask players to perform physical actions (which have no real effect on game play). Some spaces ask players to give or take cards from other players. This is significant because the object of the game is to collect all the cards. If you run out of cards you are eliminated.<br/><br/>There are a few strategically placed Slapjack spaces on the board. If someone lands on one of these spots, then each player takes a card at random (again all cards are kept face down at all times) and puts it in the center of the board. If someone puts down a Slapjack card, then the first player that slaps the card wins the hand.<br/><br/>There is a variant game listed in the rules where players use just the game cards and play a single card down one at a time. If a Slapjack card is played, then the first player to slap the card wins the hand. The last player with any cards wins. (This is essentially the Slap Jack card game, albeit with a smaller  than standard deck.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Do Your Job is a fast, family fun game. It comes with two different variants. One is a collecting game (similar to Gin Rummy or Spoons) with a twist and the other is a mind-bender with a betting mechanic.<br/><br/>In the original game variant, each player will attempt to obtain all the elements needed in order to complete their job from the card piles at the center of the table; they will need to find a Job card and the necessary Job Item card(s) during the game. Each turn players will draw a card from the top of a deck, discard a card face up onto a deck, and move a card from one deck to another (you may do these actions in any order, but you must do them all). If you successfully have all the cards necessary to Do Your Job at any point on your turn, you win!<br/><br/>Jobs are not so easily done, though. The corporate world is a cruel mistress, and the player must try to figure out the other players' jobs in order to thwart jobs being done. If people realize what job you are trying to do, desired cards can be buried within one of the decks during other players' discard or move action since you can only draw from the top of a pile.<br/><br/>In the Treachery game variant, each player tries to win the most points. They will accomplish this by first betting for the round. Then players will play a job card (either the Pirate or the Dwarf) and a number card face down. The pirates will then flip their bet (positive to negative or negative to positive) and switch number cards with the other players according to the arrows. Whoever has the highest number will win all the bets and play will repeat in this fashion. Be wary though, for if each person plays the Pirate, the bets will be flipped, but everyone keeps their number card.<br/><br/>",

Around the central tractor, there are 9 circular recesses into which the action disks are placed in random order.

It rotates and turns until it lands in one of the recesses. The action disk in the recess Johnny landed in determines the action of the active player. On numbers 1-4, the player moves his/her token the corresponding number of spaces towards the finish line. &quot;Muddy puddle&quot; means you're stuck this turn and all other players get to move one space. If Johnny lands on the &quot;Johnny the tractor&quot; disk, the first player to call out &quot;Go Johnny go!&quot; gets to move one space forward.<br/>The racing course also has special action spaces: shortcuts and spaces where you have to move back several spaces.<br/><br/>The player whose token crosses the finishing line first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of the game each pawn is on the outer ring. The goal of the game is to move the pawns to the inner rings and finally to the middle. Every turn a player throw a dice and choose which pawn to move clockwise around the circle that the pawns is currently. If the pawn ens its move in the same place as the other pawn, the other one goes back to the starting place. If a pawn finishes a move in a horse spot, then the next move that pawn will do is going to the inner circle. If it is the most inner circle then that pawn finishes his game in one of the six spots in the middle of the board.<br/><br/>When there are six spots in the middle occupied the game is over. The player that lead the most pawns to the middle is the winner. In case of a tie the values that pawns are standing on in the middle are sum up and whoever has the most is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a free trial version of the card game Karma, but with only 34 small cards (instead of the 60 large cards of the original game).<br/><br/>Each player is dealt three face-down cards that he cannot look at and that remain on the table in front of him. He is dealt six more cards, chooses three of those for his hand, and places the remaining three face-up onto his table cards in three separate stacks. One player begins by placing a card or cards of the same value from his hand onto the table face-up to create a discard pile. The other players in turn must place onto the discard stack a card or cards of the same value that match(es) or exceed(s) the value of the top card of the stack; or else, pick up the stack. Until the draw pile is gone, players must draw at the end of their turns to maintain a hand of at least three cards.<br/><br/>All of a player's hand cards must be played before any of his face-up table cards, which must in turn be played before any of his face-down table cards. A few cards allow players to break the foregoing rules. The last player with cards loses the game.<br/><br/>Karma is based on the public domain card game, Palace.<br/><br/>",

Before making a move, each player must pay a mandatory fee (10 &quot;pnż&quot;), symbolizing daily living expenses. Before rolling the dice, you can take out a loan, buy a good or a lottery ticket, and send your resume.<br/><br/>The game begins as an unemployed with an allowance and three CVs, but each character has a variety of abilities, in addition, after the first day of each month, the right to sell their goods is acquired, and for each profession there are two levels of promotion.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is &quot;survival&quot; - getting a job, own home and living. The winner is the player who not only owns a job and own house, but is also not in debt and his home is not occupied by a tenant. In the event that more than one player meets these conditions, the victory is determined by better paid work, goods and money.<br/><br/>The instructions, like the content of the cards and fields on the board, are described in a humorous, or even satirical way. The authors of the game are detached from the decisions of state officials and various life situations.<br/><br/>",

This game (for both adults and kids) inspires you to come up with creative connections between seemingly unrelated things. Pluck objects from the bag and imagine an association&mdash;poetic, practical, serious, or silly&mdash;to reveal hidden webs of meaning and surprising details about how you perceive the world. There are no wrong answers&mdash;only intriguing ideas. Be pensive. Be spontaneous. The setup and rules are simple. The possibilities are infinite.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>     1 Two Sided Game Board<br/>     1 Drawstring Bag<br/>     85 Object Chips<br/><br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Choose one side of the board to play on, the blue (easier) or green (harder).  Provide slips of paper and writing instruments to the players.  Each player draws 3 object chips, face up, from the draw bag.  The youngest player chooses one object chip blindly from the bag and places it in the center of the board.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Each round, one player (the curator) places an object chip on the board, connected to a previously played object chip.  Other players take three minutes to privately choose an association between the object and the others to which it is connected on the board, writing it on a slip of paper.  When three minutes are up, the curator shuffles and reads the examples aloud.  Each player, except the curator, votes on the best connection, drawing one object chip blindly for each vote received.  The role of curator then moves to the next player counterclockwise.  When all players have served as curator, the player with the most objects is the winner.<br/><br/>An alternate &quot;cooperative&quot; ruleset is provided for a puzzle activity experience, placing pieces on the board and attempting to make compelling associations.<br/><br/>",

Each player or team is capable of such highlights as Reverse Dunks, 360 degree Slams, Three Pointers, Spin Moves, Fast Breaks, Hook Shots and other moves during game play that keep you on the edge of your seat.

This fun-filled, family oriented game includes: 1 coin, 100 Offense cards, 150 Defense cards, 2 Time Out cards, 4 Quarter cards, score sheets and instructions. The game is for 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>",

The game is of the simple 'draw-a-card-answer-a-question' variety. Getting answers right allows one to draw lines connecting 'nodes' on the curious seven-sided folding board that depicts a map of the world. The first player to connect sufficient nodes in all the different regions wins.<br/><br/>The game comes with the unusual board, a deck of General Knowledge/Expert question cards (General Knowledge on one side, Expert on the other), a deck of Operations cards (like chance cards) and 4 erasable marker pens in different colors. The pens are used to mark the lines in one's network on the board, and also to write down your score.<br/><br/>The theme is on telecommunications networks and this is reflected in the questions asked. There are also options to use Submarine Cable and Satellite Systems on the board to help complete your network.<br/><br/>",

With Idols - The Game you can show others your true capacity.<br/><br/>Each player takes a couple of his cd's with him to play this game. The board has a track with 60 spaces. Each round the players move their pawn by using a roll &amp; die mechanic. Several spaces trigger actions. There is a space when you can choose a song from a cd and the player if choice has to guess the title of this song; if he fails his pawn goes a determined number of spaces back. There are also spaces where you have to continue the lyrics of a song or where you have the sing a couple of lines. The player who is first to reach space nr. 60 on the board wins.<br/><br/>Each Idol game is based on the region of origin, with music reflective of the competitors on that show.<br/><br/>",

Rolls of 5 or 9 force you to give one of your opened gifts to the player on your right or left just like in stage 1. The roll of a 7,11 or double allows you to yell the word ZUNKER and then take a gift from anyone and place it in front of you. If you don't say ZUNKER you get to take nothing!  During this second stage you use the included timer which is set for 20 minutes. After the 20 minutes has expired the game is over and you keep whatever gift(s) that you have still in front of you.<br/><br/>",

Between pervasive evil and countless temptations lurking beneath the city's glittery facade, Los Angeles proves to be the ideal address for a fallen vampire looking to save a few lost souls.<br/><br/>There are souls to be saved during daylight hours and in the dead of night. You have to choose which to save, you cannot win this battle by tryng to save both!<br/><br/>As the night approaches you will turn into your alter ego... a vampire. You will have special powers to see what others are not able to see in the day. Make the most of this time, for come the dawn, you will lose these powers, and have more mortal weaknesses.<br/><br/>By day or night there are souls to be saved and dangers to overcome. But in this game, if you can call it that, you not only have to look out for yourself. But also try to discover what other players are doing.<br/><br/>Only by doing this will you be able to manipulate the game towards its conclusion. For you to be the winner and the saviour of souls!<br/><br/>This game uses a license from the Angel TV series which ran from 1999 to 2004. The series was a spin-off of the Buffy the Vampire Slayer TV series.<br/><br/>The game mixes Roll and Move, hand management and memory mechanics. Each player has two hands of cards from distinct day and night decks but has limited opportunities to look at them. During the game, players manipulate their decks and decks of their opponents using different actions which are triggered either by landing on action squares or by action cards.<br/><br/>The first player to reach his starting point with three souls in one hand and none in the other wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The idea of this game is to teach children about the inequality of the world and the idea of development work in third world countries. The game takes place in a fantasy world of insects that is secretly ruled by the evil Tyrant and his sidekick Niljake (Slimy). In the beginning, the insect realms have different amounts of resources; some are poor while some have plenty. The poorest player, being the most desperate and thus also bravest, starts. The game is a mix of co-operative and individual play, as typically the players can only advance on the board by sharing their income. Likewise, the draconian measures of the Tyrant usually affect all the players and not just the intended victim. The idea is to expose the Tyrant and fill everyone's resources, and the winner is the player who accomplishes the second goal after the first one has already been accomplished.<br/><br/>The three types of resource are: Food &amp; Water, Money &amp; Wealth, Education &amp; Rights.<br/><br/>The insect realms are:<br/><br/>1. Dunghill of the Beetles<br/>2. Spiders' Webbery<br/>3. Butterfly Valley<br/>4. Beeland<br/>5. Castle Ladybug <br/>6. Mosquito Swamp<br/><br/>The game has been designed and published by the humanitarian organization UFF Finland with Tactic's help. The title translates literally as 'Draw' (as in a game with shared victory).<br/><br/>",

The game takes place standing up in a moderately open space, enough for the players to move around freely.<br/><br/>Do Move Say has two main layers: The Mastermind and Detective game and the Townspeople game.<br/><br/>The Mastermind is trying to accomplish three tasks: Disable three players, find a secret key, and pass a secret note. The Detective must stand outside of the space and determine which player is the Mastermind before the tasks are complete.<br/><br/>The Mastermind must complete the tasks in the midst of the Townspeople game. Each Townsperson has instructions on how to behave in the space, including two &quot;if / then&quot; statements and two global statements. Their behavior makes it difficult for the Detective to determine which player is the Mastermind, while also making the Mastermind's tasks challenging.<br/><br/>Mod cards are also available in the deck, which give one or more of the townspeople goals other than satisfying both &quot;if / then&quot; statements.

The prompter will then read from a Green (situation) card and a White (topic) card. Players then have 90 seconds to come up with a pun that fits both cards. The Prompter selects the best pun, gives that player the cards, and that player then becomes the Prompter for the next round.

You set your opponent up.  Every card has two abilities on it, when you play the card, you do both abilities in order.  Every card also has a Sandwich on it, when your opponent does the action listed for the Sandwich, then you get to score that card as a Sandwich.  The abilities on the card are about either drawing cards, or stealing cards, or replacing cards, or controlling what your opponent draws or has in their hand.  In short, you are manipulating your opponent's situation so that they play what you want them to play, so you can score points or 'Sandwich' off of their play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Vampire Diaries is a board game based on the Warner Brothers television show of the same name. Players take on the role of one of four characters from the show, Elena, Stefan, Damon or Bonnie, and begin the game in possession of a photo-frame portraying their character as a human. A switch in the back of the photo-frame can be used to transform the photo into that of a vampire, and the object of the game is to avoid receiving three bite marks, thereby being the last remaining human.<br/><br/>Game play occurs in turns with players moving a dry erase vampire marker/mover around a simple game board. In turn, each player rolls three dice marked with crows and moves the marker/mover zero to three spaces clockwise, depending on the number of crows rolled. The space the marker lands on allows the player to use the top portion of the vampire mover to apply a dry erase vampire bite stamp to another player's photo-frame, erase one of his or her own vampire bites with the supplied dry erase pad, swap photos with another player, or gain control of the Family Crest Ring which protects that player from vampire bites. A roll of zero crows does not move the marker, instead automatically gaining control of the Family Crest Ring for the player who rolled the zero.<br/><br/>When a player receives the third vampire bite on his photo-frame, he can no longer win the game, erase bites, swap photos or possess the Family Crest Ring. However, he can remain in the game, taking turns as normal, but only dealing out vampire bites as allowed. The last player without three vampire bites wins the game.<br/><br/>",

We have designed the game where one can broaden his knowledge about Corvette history in an atmosphere of competition.<br/><br/>A great deal of effort as been put forth to obtain the data for this game. Hundreds of sources and publications have been checked to ensure the proper answer for each question; including 30 combined years of working on the Corvette Assembly Line.  But nothing is absolute in the world of auto production, especially Corvettes. All questions are for the enjoyment of the family.&quot;<br/><br/>The game is a trivia game but also a race around the board for a certain number of laps which are agreed upon by the players before starting(standard = 3 laps). Each turn you are asked a question (multiple choice). If you answer correctly you may roll the dice and move that number of spaces. If incorrect then you don't move.  There are also some special spaces on the board for flat tire, pit stop, engine trouble, traffic jams, plant tours, etc.  The first to finish the set number of laps wins the game.<br/><br/>There are three levels to the game: <br/>1. Beginner: Roll the dice and advance WITHOUT answering questions. (I'm being serious, it's in the rules)<br/>2. Enthusiast: Standard rules.<br/>3. Corvette Buff: Ask questions without multiple choice options.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>Game Board<br/>Set of 100 trivia cards (6 questions per card)<br/>4 Corvette pawns<br/>Rules<br/><br/>Some question examples(most are pretty tough):<br/>- What was the first year forr AM/FM tape systems? 1963, 1977, or 1979.<br/>- A soft top was available in 1962. True or false.<br/>- How many interior colors were available in 1955?  3, 4, or 6.<br/>- How may 1978 Corevettes were built? 32,966, 37,267, or 46,726.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Described by the Publisher/Designer:<br/><br/>Ultimate Soccer is a new and exciting soccer board game that allows you to be the player as well as the coach.  You play against each other alternating as an attacker and a defender.  The attacker can select either a Fate or an Action card from draw piles.  Action cards map out actual plays with 2-6 passes and a shot on goal.  Each Action card has a number on it 5v3 or 3v3.  These numbers tell you how many dice you will be rolling against each other for each pass.  The attacker is always the first number.  If the attacker rolls a higher number it completes the pass and you go on to the next pass, if the defender rolls a higher number than the attacker the pass was not complete and the action card gets discarded and now the defender draws a Fate or Action card and becomes the attacker.  If the attacker completes all of his passes and is now at the last line on the card this is the shot on goal.  For the shot on goal the attacker and the defender only roll one die a piece to simulate the shooter and the goalkeeper.<br/><br/>Fate cards are things that can happen during a game like red card, injuries, goalkeeper saves.  Fate cards can be used at any time to help you in your game.  The game is complete when all the action cards have been used.  Unless someone has an injury time fate card and wants to use it.<br/><br/>",

Players take the part of powerful merchants attempting to gain economic prominence throughout the Known Lands.  Gold is earned by using caravans to transport resources (wood, grain, fish, stone, ore, and precious metals) from source locations to demand locations which change dynamically during the game.  Trading is not always peaceful, though, and merchants must hire mercenaries and build warehouses to protect their shipments.  Diplomacy plays a key role as players are free to make all manner deals and treaties with other Merchants, including such things as setting up toll roads or extorting weak trade groups by threatening them.  Mythrole: Merchants is suitable for 2-6 players working alone or in teams, and plays in 2-6 hours, with the length being customizable by choosing the appropriate victory conditions.<br/><br/>",

The one who does that the first wins.<br/><br/>At the start all players take chance tokens and place them upside down on various board tiles. Later each player gets energy tokens. Then they roll the die and move as many tiles as the number they rolled. If a player wants, he/she could lose one (or more) of his energy tokens and go climb as many spaces as the number of energy tokens he/she gave up. If player steps on a chance token, he/she must take it and do whatever it says. There are various tokens - some orders to go some spaces up or down, some orders to roll die again. If player takes a card with a lion or aborigines, he must fight by placing any number of energy tokens between 1 and 5 and rolling die. If rolled number is higher than tokens placed, player will lose. If player   loses to the aborigines, they will rob him/her and the player will lose all energy tokens. If player loses against the lion, he will have to fight again and again (each fight is one turn). If player loses all of his/her energy tokens, he/she loses the game. If player passes another player, he/she must give him/her one energy token. If player steps on tile occupied by other player, that other player must give him/her energy token. If player wins against lion, he must go back to the nearest village. If two players step on lion at the same time, they must fight against the lion together by placing energy tokens.

        "description": "Troll Knuckles is a dice rolling game, consisting of three dice:<br/><br/>- The &quot;Knuckle&quot;, a green die with even numbers (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12)<br/>- The &quot;Toe&quot;, a purple die with odd numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11)<br/>- The &quot;Eye&quot;, a red die with the troll-primes (1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9)<br/><br/>A turn consists of three &quot;slices&quot;, consisting of rolling particular dice.  After the rolls, the player will have gathered three numbers, which are then matched up to particular &quot;gut&quot; (ie, combination).  A couple are poker-like (two of a kind, three of a kind), while a few other guts are preset (for example, 6-9-2 is called Aphrodite's Smile).<br/><br/>The first slice consists of rolling all three dice, keeping two and throwing one away.  You must remember the two numbers AND remember which number came from which die.  As an example (to assist in describing the next slices), you roll green-2 purple-9 red-7 and decide to keep the purple and red dice.<br/><br/>The second slice consists of re-rolling the two kept dice.  You must then throw out of of those two dice, and keep the two numbers from the kept die.  To continue the example, you re-roll the purple and red dice and get purple-1 red-3.  You decide to keep the purple, which means your two numbers are 9 (from the first slice) and 1 (from this slice).<br/><br/>The third slice consists of rerolling the die chosen for your third number. To continue the example, you reroll purple and get 5, making your three numbers 9, 1 and 5.  These can now be arranged in any order and compared against the scoring table to determine poker-like ranking against other players in the same round.  Highest gut wins.<br/><br/>One minor exception are &quot;The Loads&quot;, which are guts that must be matched against all three dice in the first slice only.  Rolling one of those is an automatic win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game isn't exactly played to &quot;win&quot;, but instead players get a score in percentage points which determines their levels of telepathic powers. The percent ranges are as follows: 100% to 82%, Exceptional Telepathic Powers; 81% to 70%, Good Telepathic Powers; over 52%, Some Telepathic Powers. Points are earned by mentally reading images on game cards that other players send to you telepathically.<br/><br/>Players move game pawns around the board along a path that goes through the &quot;Sky Temple,&quot; &quot;Earth Temple,&quot; &quot;Sun Temple,&quot; and &quot;Moon Temple&quot;. After circling the board players arrive at the &quot;Thought Plateau&quot;, which surrounds a picture of Mr. Dunninger, the game's creator and reputed &quot;Man with the Miracle Mind&quot; (according to the instruction sheet). Hints are included on the instruction sheet about how to concentrate and utilize your telepathic powers.<br/><br/>The game board is brightly colored and features Egyptian hieroglyphics throughout. Four sets of &quot;Cycle&quot; cards displaying letters, numbers, shapes, and colors, and four game pawns, as well as score sheets, the game board, and instructions sheet (one, double sided) complete the game.<br/><br/>The rules are a double sided 8.5 x 11 sheet of paper.  On the bottom of page 2, it states the game was &quot;created by Joseph Dunninger,&quot; 1967 Hassenfeld Bros., Inc., Pawtucket, RI USA.<br/><br/>The bgg data based listed Sid Sackson as the designer but this is not correct.  Sid does reference it twice in his journals on 10/29/67 and 11/7/67.  He writes that he thinks &quot;The Amazing Dunninger Mind Reading Game&quot; resembled &quot;I Spy.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The three face card characters in the deck represent the qualities that help to win. They are  LUCK,   BRAINS,  and  COURAGE.  It takes  LUCK  to draw the right card at the right time, BRAINS  to remember cards you only see once, and  COURAGE  to save for a FOUR SQUARE call. The objective is to go out early and catch your opponents with big counts in their hands. There are two ways to go out. One is to  KNOCK,  betting that you have the lowest hand around the table. The other is to build a hand with four-of-a-kind. During the play, hands are kept face down on the table and arranged in a square, hence the name &quot;FOUR SQUARE.&quot; In either case, the losing players' scores are increased by the number of the points in their hands, in some cases doubled or tripled, as later described. The game continues until at least one player has a total score of 100 or more. The player with the lowest score is the winner. In case of a tie, the winners share the honor.<br/><br/>",

If you're the first player to collect one each of all five sights, you win.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to move a stand-up playing piece along the pathway and take five pictures of Barney. Movement is determined by a spinner with a player moving forward to the color indicated by the result. The spinner is a clever representation of a camera. Players draw one or two cards when landing on designated areas. Some cards require a player to take a &quot;pretend&quot; picture of another contestant with the camera/spinner while that kid makes a certain facial expression. The Rainbow Picture cards are drawn randomly as player land on spaces that reward a lucky spin. Each player tries to assemble a complete set of five different Barney poses and win the game.<br/><br/>(description stolen from Pete Belli's review: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/496407/i-love-you-you-love-me-were-a-happy-family\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/496407/i-love-you-you-lo...</a>-)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is very similar to the Palitoy &quot;Striker&quot; soccer game, but without the build quality or fun factor.<br/><br/>The pitch is made of a peculiar green material with a strange foam backing that sticks to the carpet; the goals are identical to the one in Striker, but with plastic netting. The game comes supplied with two teams - red and blue, but instead of 5 players per team of Striker, Cup Final only has 3 players on each side.<br/><br/>The two outfield players are plastic with a metal kicking leg, with one player having a bent leg, and one a straight leg. The straight legged player had a scooped foot for lobbing the ball, but this mechanism doesn't work very well. The kicking action is controlled by a button on the back of the base as opposed to the &quot;bash 'em on the head&quot; mechanism used in Striker. Additionally, the figures are very badly designed, and the slightest movement causes them to fall over (are they Christian Ronaldo in disguise?).<br/><br/>The goalkeepers are identical in design to the original Striker goalkeepers, as they swivel at the waist and have a crooked arm for throwing the ball out.<br/><br/>The ball is not round, but more of a honeycomb. One half of the ball is coloured red, the other half blue. The team whose colour is on the top face of the ball when it comes to rest has the right to play the ball, so the purpose of the game is always keep the top face of your colour visible while dribbling.<br/><br/>Basically it's a cheap reproduction of Striker by Palitoy. Avoid.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Counterpoint consists of a raised dark golden plastic board (two inches high and thirteen and a half inches in width and length... it fits rather precisely into the square box), four plastic player markers (green, red, blue, and yellow), and a single six-sided die.<br/>There is no instruction manual; the instructions are printed on the back of the box's top.<br/>The player markers are slightly oddly shaped for no apparent reason, and somewhat resemble modern art that's not supposed to look like anything in particular.  Stand a rectangle up so it's tall, then cut a very wide and short triangle out of one side, and that's the basic shape.<br/>The board has a number of odd features.  The center of it is a square that sinks down slightly into a square piece of black foam.  This is where the die and player pieces rest when the game isn't being played.  Around the center of the board is a narrow track with black and white arrows that can be flipped horizontally to show an arrow pointing in the opposite direction.  In one direction, the arrow is black and the background is white... in the other direction, the colors are reversed.  Each corner of the board has a tiny colored slot for the appropriate player piece to rest just before start... however, the groove isn't very deep at all and it's easy for the tall pieces to get knocked out.<br/>The game is very simple.  Two players take a clockwise route along one side of the track, and two others take a counterclockwise route along the other side.  A player rolls a die, and moves his piece the appropriate number of spaces.  If the final resting place for his piece is on a spot where the arrow is turned the wrong way, he must move back to the closest arrow that points in the proper direction, and then flips any arrows he wishes on the board equal to the number rolled on the die.  The first player that makes a full circle around the board and lands on or passes his starting point wins.<br/><br/>",

In the first mode, players assume the roles of reporters who are trying to get an exclusive scoop of UFO sightings in the city of Frankfurt, Germany.<br/><br/>Each player is assigned a color and a transmission tower.  Their goal is to transport photographs of extraterrestial visitors at locations in the city to their towers (transmitting the scoop back to their news agencies).  Each player starts with one photo card, and take turns to roll a die, moving their card by the die's result.  They draw new photo cards on a &quot;6&quot;.  The reporters can deploy Stop Stones to stop other reporters from moving through.  The first reporter to transmit back three photographs wins the game.<br/><br/>The second mode of the game is called Top Secret, which is played on the other side of the game board.  The game takes place in the news agency and players are racing against time to dig out what the others know.  Each player thinks up a secret word at the start.  On their turn, they roll a die, move their marker by the result, and can ask another player for one letter of their word.  Players get points for guessing another player's secret word (which then has to be thought up anew).  The game ends when one player's marker reaches the end point and the winner is the player who has the highest score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From a review by Rick Heli, Spotlight on Games:<br/><br/>The game comes in a long box with a board, five decks of cards, a number of plastic chips in four colors representing gold pieces, six plastic pawns and a die.<br/><br/>The board is a circular track of thirty-four spaces with a depiction of a castle within it. In the castle are twelve labeled castle sections (drawbridge, six towers, king's court, dungeon, kitchen, rosengarden and dining hall) which players will try to own -- denoted by holding a card with the corresponding name.<br/><br/>Players all begin on the Start space with fifty gold pieces and roll the single die to move forward. Landing on a castle section allows buying that section, or, if it is already owned, forces payment of half the purchase price to the owner. Costs range from six to the most expensive section, the Drawbridge, which costs twenty. No section may be purchased until the Drawbridge has been. Other spaces on the board force drawing a card from one of three available decks which may have a cost to use: Move (free) moves the player to another space; Give (costs two) has various positive and negative effects; Receive (costs two) is similar to Give; Wishing Well (costs ten) has various effects including the Key to the Royal Bedroom. No one can win without the Key card. In addition, it is necessary to own at least half the castle sections.<br/><br/>Other spaces on the board force payment of tax, placed in the center of the board, or the chance to claim all the collected taxes. There are also three Flogging spaces where the player must either pay ten to avoid the flogging and take another turn or else roll a single die and risk going to the Dungeon. Players in the Dungeon languish there until another player is sent to the Dungeon, at which point they pay the new player one gold and resume play. The only other spaces on the board are one each to pick a player to lose a turn and to choose a player to be sent to the Dungeon.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A unique collectible &quot;stickerstripgame&quot; with an epic fantasy background story, W97 is a new type of game for two players of ages 10+, which combines collecting and pasting of stickers with unusual game mechanisms.  In W97, players put together different sets of heroes, places, spells, victory conditions and much more based on a large supply of available stickers. The game is played on &quot;terrain strips&quot;, which are divided into five quadratic fields next to each other, where the stickers are placed.<br/><br/>Every player puts together an individual place- and hero-set for a game of W97. A place-set is made up of six terrain strips Forest, Water, Desert, Swamp, Mountains and Grassland, where the stickers of tower, ruin, castle, city, cave and temple, that have to be conquered, with different amount of points on them, individually are pasted on.<br/><br/>A hero-set is put together of different heroes, representing the leaders of each player's armies (which are available in the game as small colored wooden cubes, that are placed next to the strips), who have to be distributed among the six terrain strips as well.<br/><br/>In W97 no general victory conditions are available for both players. Each player must setup the best fitting victory conditions for their places and heroes in their own game-sets themselves.<br/><br/>Success and failure in W97 is determined by a well put together game-set, the strategy of the player and the overall luck of dice rolls.<br/><br/>New players will find an easy and fast introduction into W97 through the basic set, which comes with pre-configured, presorted strips for two players. It is even not necessary to paste stickers onto the terrain strips, because all places and heroes already have been printed together with the terrain types in advance. In addition the basic game includes 6x60 wooden cubes, five color dice, a German and an English rulebook each and a randomly chosen Expansion-Set.<br/><br/>(Based on information from Wassertal Spieleverlag.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Clearly a very small-release inside joke, in this game players use their Robot Assassins in a race to earn 100 points by killing &quot;various targets.&quot; The various targets include figures from the gaming industry such as Steve Jackson, Gary Gygax, Mike Stackpole, Richard Garfield, and the games' own designer (sadly, I don't see a target card for Reiner Knizia). Each player starts the game with a &quot;Plain Bot&quot; and may spend points to change the model of the Robot Assassin. Play is a simple matter of using cards to benefit assassins and targets and rolling dice to overcome modified target values. Game includes dice small enough that you could accidentally inhale them.<br/><br/>",

First, all the tiles are turned face down and then kids race against the timer to place as many tiles on the symmetrical board as possible. The tiles may look simple, but are designed around unique animal pairs that will test children's identification and motor skills. At the end of each player's turn, the total number of tiles placed correctly on the board are counted and recorded on the unique score sheet. Kids can play as many rounds as they want and best of all the game cannot be mastered since each turn presents a completely new challenge. Eyecatcher Junior encourages kids to concentrate carefully while acting quickly and they have lots of fun doing it!<br/><br/>",

There are five obstructions on the track, such as &quot;REPLENISH OIL&quot; etc., representing two spaces, all of which must be jumped in the progress of the game.

        "description": "15mm tabletop game owing a nod to computer games like Rainbow 6 and Counterstrike.  Comes in a box with 11 miniatures, one 128-page book (the rules are about 14 pages - the rest is lists and background), two dice and a tape measure.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is an action point system with straight d10 rolls used to resolve actions.  Combat is a lengthy process where you have to hit, wound and beat an armor save (yes, it's Warhammer 40k all over again) and then see what injury you delivered. Armor and injury saves are not modified by weapons, so whether you took a hit from a derringer or an anti-material rifle makes no difference to the target - a rather silly outcome, but there you have it.<br/><br/>There is a point buy system, a lengthy compendium of weapons &amp; equipment (many of them with quite unrealistic stats) and a number of light vehicles (civilian models primarily - no tanks or APCs).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "If you've ever been intrigued by that game of futuristic land combat by a company whose name rhymes with &quot;Hames Nerkslop,&quot; but were put off by the cost of figures or the time and skill needed to paint them, this game might be just the ticket. Instead of expensive figures, you use free downloadable counters. Instead of a large gaming table filled with hand-made scenery, you use my M8 maps. If you want a bigger army or a larger map, just download another page and print it. Time-consuming movement and combat rules have been replaced with fast-playing hex-based rules. And all the occult stuff in the original game has been replaced with... nothing at all.<br/><br/>If you're unfamiliar with that game, the premise is straightforward: buy soldiers, vehicles and weapons with the build-points given to you, then fight an enemy of a different alien race. You can also &quot;buy&quot; experience or special skills for your troops, or add a Hero if you think he will help. Some races excel at crunching close combat, while some prefer a fast-moving style; some fight in low-tech swarms, and others prefer high-tech gadgets. Vehicles range from one-man scout bikes to hulking super-tanks. The size of the battle can be a squad of foot soldiers, or a company of 150-plus men with dozens of vehicles, or anything in between. Several basic scenarios are provided with the rules. Almost everything is definable. <br/><br/><br/>StarMarines is a Free game based off of War Hammer 40,000",

        "description": "Game by a company that specializes in publishing business books and self-study courses.<br/><br/>CEO is essentially a trivia game for business students and business history buffs. Many questions are specific to the time-period (1984), which makes answering them tricky at best and eye-rollingly impossible at worst.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to move up the corporate ladder from Entry Level to the CEO position. To accomplish this, players answer questions in categories like Slogans and Trademarks, Crimes and Blunders, Media, and others. Each correct answer earns the player performance review slips, which are collected (along with another correct answer, this time to a special Promotion question) to earn promotions to the next level. Each level requires a greater number of performance review slips to move ahead. If a player lands on a Pink Slip space, they may take away all the collected performance reviews of an opponent. The first player to be promoted to CEO wins the game.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/><br/>     Game board<br/>     4 question booklets<br/>     Performance review slips<br/>     4 pawns<br/>     6-sided die<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "THE MARKET SQUARE is one of a series of Monopoly style board game developed by local YMCAs in the UK to generate funds for their activities. The games in the series are essentially the same, but as in the different versions of Monopoly, the board and the businesses are specifically themed to the town or city represented in the title - in this case LISBURN in Northern Ireland.<br/><br/>Players progress around the board as a result of the roll of 2D6. When landing on a Company square a player may purchase a share in that company (there are two shares available in each company), if he wishes. If not he may put the share up for auction, with any excess over the sale price being retained by that player as his fee for being the auctioneer.<br/><br/>Players landing on companies that are already owned must pay to visit, with the payment due being based on how many shares are owned in that particular company and in the other two companies in the same colour series. Since shares can be owned by two different players both may demand payment from a visitor.<br/><br/>Certain squares on the board require the drawing of a Chance card which normally result in income being received from or paid to the bank.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;New Share Quotations&rdquo; square results in the changing of share prices for some of the blocks of companies. This will result in players losing or gaining money on the shares that they own. It also requires players to put up one of their shares for auction thereby permitting players to trade in shares.<br/><br/>The game can be ended in three ways, which should be decided before the game starts:<br/>- After a set time.<br/>- When the first player becomes bankrupt.<br/>- When all but one player has gone bankrupt.<br/><br/>At the end of the game the money is counted and shares are valued at whatever is the then current rate. The player with the greatest assets is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

The gears are laid end-to-end, with the larger gears in the middle. Each player claims one of the smaller end gears as their &quot;home&quot; gear.<br/><br/>To play, the unit (requiring 2 &quot;D&quot; batteries) is turned on, which sets all 4 gears spinning. Then the marbles are dumped into the large central gears. Each player controls a switch that, when pressed, lowers a gate between their home gear and the larger gear, allowing marbles to pass through -- but also letting marbles pass back out to the larger gears.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the first player to capture all 6 of your marbles in your home gear.<br/><br/>",

These may be moved either 1 or 4 squares each turn in a straight line in any direction but may not jump over any other pieces.  Pieces are captured if they are sandwiched between two pieces of one other player of if the piece becomes the third piece in a diagonal formation.  Captured pieces entitle a player to reclaim pieces previously lost.<br/><br/>There are three levels of winning.  Basic - by eliminating all of your opponent's pieces.  A scroll win - make the scroll zone entirely your color.  A Grand scroll - make the scroll zone entirely your color, but without using your sleeping man.<br/><br/>",

Now available with either Dicecar Jr. rules and Extreme Dicecar rules packages.<br/>Here&rsquo;s the skinny of what Dicecar is. Dicecar is a Table Top Racing game that is played using dice and cards. The drivers must have their own 1/64th scale race cars. These are available at most department stores in the toy section or at your local racing collectible stores. Some spaces on the race track allow you lane changes or prompt you to draw cards which could be good or bad. Pit road is outlined in yellow, so you know where the speed limit begins. Strategies include pit stops in which you choose gas only, one side or both sides tire changes. Avoiding trouble and making moves which can put you in front of the competition are important strategies as well. To win you must be the first driver to cross the start/finish line after completing all of the laps and pit stops. Table Top Racing is no fantasy as you race face to face with your family and friends. Everyone can race at Dicecar. You don&rsquo;t need to be a race fan to enjoy the game. Racing knowledge can help but it is not necessary. Experience counts, so race a few times as you develop your strategy. Dicecar includes qualifying, drafting, unscheduled pit stops for tire or engine trouble. Crashes can happen and the yellow flag will bring out the pace car for a caution. Have fun racing and building your 1/64th scale racing world. Different tracks are available as well as accessories like the high banks and soft walls. Other items such as the pace car, jet dryer trucks, tow trucks and ambulances are also available and make your world of Dicecar a lot of fun.<br/><br/>",

In this variation the first player to 100 points wins, with higher points being achieved by the concentric rings of the target or the cup itself.<br/><br/>The Tiddeldy Winks Bowling game is what makes this unique.  In this variation the target/cup remains in the box, but a cover is placed on the cup.  Atop that cover sits a red bowling pin with a separate wide circular base.  Nine white pins are placed on the marked circles around it, forming the ten pins of a standard triangular bowling arrangement.<br/><br/>Players try to snap their winks and down the pins.  Ten points are awarded for the red pin, and one for each of the white pins.  The player with the highest total after ten rounds of three winks snapped wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Make sure the cutout figures are secure on the holder&mdash; Mary on one side, Bert on the other.  Place selector on space provided on playing board.<br/><br/>To operate the selector, pick up the figure holder and let the pole slide all the way through.  Place the base back on the circle and release the figure holder.  It will spin to the bottom of the pole and spin to a stop.  One pointer will point to one of the instructions surrounding the merry-go-round, the other will indicate a different instruction.<br/><br/>To determine order of play, each player picks a playing piece and puts it on one of the instructions around the merry-go-round.  The figure holder is lifted and released and the player which Mary points to (or is nearest) goes first.  Order of play is then clockwise from the playing piece of the first player.<br/><br/>All players now place their playing pieces on Cherry Tree Lane ready to start.<br/><br/>PLAY: Each player &quot;asks Mary&quot; for his instructions by using the merry-go-round selector as described earlier.  The instructions Mary points to are then followed.<br/><br/>In moving around the board players follow any instructions given on the square where their playing piece lands.<br/><br/>If a player's piece lands on a sidewalk picture the selector is operated again by that player and he now &quot;asks Bert.&quot;<br/><br/>If a playing piece lands on a carpet bag the player may, at his next turn, decide whether to advance directly to the next carpet bag or whether to &quot;ask Mary.&quot;  This choice exists for any player at any time his piece is on a carpet bag.<br/><br/>If a player lands on an umbrella he immediately &quot;asks Mary&quot; again.<br/><br/>The countryside counts as three squares if a player is passing through it.  However, if a player chooses to be sent there by Mary or Bert he must miss his next two turns.  (If a player waiting in the countryside trades places with a player in front or in back of him, he is free and the traded player must wait whatever turns remain.)<br/><br/>Winner is the first player to reach the park.<br/><br/>",

Can you escape the volcano and reach safety evading the Tyrannosaurus Rex as it stalks across the board and without falling prey for the many other prehistoric pitfalls as you go. Good Luck!<br/>A monster game for 2-4 players aged 6-adult<br/><br/>Game description:<br/>The game is a simple children's game similar to snakes and ladders but with the added twist of a T-Rex. The board has a linear path where players all start from a common starting point and move towards a common ending point. Along the way there are special spots where the player can move forward / backward automatically (ala snakes and ladders), miss a turn, throw again, or cause the T-Rex to move.<br/>The T-Rex twist involves a T-Rex token that starts somewhere in the middle of the board. A player rolls his die and moves the number of spaces as indicated on the die (again just like snakes and ladders). He then moves the T-Rex backwards or forwards the same number of squares as he wishes. If the T-Rex is moved to the same spot as another player, that player falls back 12 spaces.<br/>In this way, turn by turn, players try to advance to the end while at the same time try to use the T-Rex to stomp on their opponents and make them fall back.<br/>The first player who reaches the end wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each deck contains Bonus Recipes to let you prepare delicious meals 'Soap Style.' &quot;<br/><br/>This is a trivia game consisting of 46 cards and a standard 6-sided die.  There are 6 questions on each card, numbered 1 through 6.  The higher the number, the more difficult the question.  The questions are about the soap opera General Hospital, covering the decade of the 1980s.<br/><br/>A player rolls a die and has the top card of the deck read to them, based on the number rolled.  If the question is answered correctly, the person keeps the card and rolls again.  If incorrect, the card goes on the bottom of the deck, and it's the next players turn.<br/><br/>The game is over when the draw deck is empty.  The person with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>Note that due to the recycling of the cards, this can be a very lengthy game if the players are not experts on General Hospital of the 1980s.<br/><br/>There are also rules for solo play (go through the deck once, rolling the die for each one -- if you get 27 or more correct, you win).<br/><br/>Also, as mentioned on the back of the card deck, included as a bonus are 9 recipes inspired by the characters of General Hospital.<br/><br/>",

The youngest player starts by turning over one of the cards and matching it with one of the characters on his playing board. If he cannot, he leaves the card face upwards on the table. The next player may then take this card or selects another. Play continues; should a player turn over a card the he already has, play passes to the next player.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to cover all his characters on his playing board.<br/><br/>FOR OLDER CHILDREN: If a player picks up a card he does not need he replaces the card face downwards on the table. The other players then have to remember where that card was replaced if they need that particular character.<br/><br/>",

Although the game is quite simple, there is some ambition in it. The riders are supposed to climb  the Tourmalet, Lagos de Covadonga and the Mortirolo mountains. The teams are composed of four riders (well, counters colored in green, purple, yellow and red, each color for a team), one of them being the leader. The leader has the privilege of something called turbo, which is not more than throwing two dice instead of one. This can be done four times during the race.<br/><br/>",

The deck is made up of 4 sets of differently colored cards with numbers from 1 to 6.  There are also Miracle cards (wild cards), cards that cause the next player to pick up 1 or 2 cards, and Skip cards.<br/><br/>Note: This game is different from UNO in the following ways:<br/>- Instead of &quot;Draw 4 wild cards&quot;, this game contains some &quot;Draw 1&quot; cards.  This is in addition to the &quot;Draw 2 cards&quot; both games have.<br/>- This game has only a 35-card deck.<br/>- When a person has only one card left in their hand, they are to call out &quot;Joseph&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Suggested time is in between 90 to 180 minutes.<br/><br/>Each one starts with 2500000 DM in paper money. This can be used to invest in players (national or international) and stadiums. These can only be bought/sold when landing on the appropriate space.<br/><br/>Landing on a ball or stadium space means your team is playing a game. If on a ball space or a stadium owned by nobody, the bank pays out the team, looking at the amount and type (national/international) of sportsmen purchased.<br/>If someone does own the stadium 300.000 DM spectator entrance fees are paid by the bank. This is used to pay the visiting team and rent to the owner of the stadium. Some stadiums have a team color and are rented by the managers at the beginning of the game. Until purchased players pay rent to the bank when games are played there.<br/><br/>A fee must be paid every time the starting space is passed<br/>(monthly expenses). Other spaces (&quot;Draw card&quot;, &quot;Pay bonuses&quot;,...) can also cause loss/gain of money. <br/>When landing on a shortcut space you must use it.

It is played much like Monopoly in that players roll dice to advance around the board and purchase properties.  Properties are named after Juneau, AK businesses and once a player acquires all the businesses in a set he/she may purchase customers to make the business  collect more when other players land on them.  There are also fate and foxfire spaces that force the player to draw a random event card when landed on.  These cards have a variety of effects, such as giving or taking away money.  The game is won when a player manages to bankrupt everyone else.  A player becomes bankrupt when he lands on an owned property that he/she can't pay the owner for.<br/><br/>",

They sit in alternating seats around the board. Each player has a marker placed on the home port and two tokens placed in the pool. The Russian is the aggressor and moves first. Whoever starts rolls and then moves. Different squares have different instructions that must be followed when landed on. If you land on a space that an opponent is on you are repelled back to the space you started your move on and you lose your turn. Many spaces cause you to lose tokens to the pool, lose a turn, return to port etc.  Victory is achieved by the side that has a majority of force in the enemies port at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The gameboard is a thirty-six by thirty-six grid that represents a large body of water. The grid is divided into four quadrants. The players start with a small whale boat that is placed inside an individual&rsquo;s factory ship. Each player places one&rsquo;s own factory ship at an individual start space at the edge of one&rsquo;s own quadrant. One of the whales is placed on one the four spaces in the center of the gameboard. Players, in turn, move their factory ships according to the number indicated on the spinner. If spinner points to a picture of a whale, then the whale moves according the number on its spinner. A player must separate the whale boat from the factory ship when the whale and the factory ship are in the same quadrant. Whale boats have their own spinner and they move slower that do the factory ships. When the whale boat and the whale are on the same space, the whale has been harpooned and the player scores a point for killing the whale. The whale boat must be moved back into the factory boat and another whale is brought into play. The last whale brought into play is white and it is worth two points. The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's web site:<br/>The board game Terminated was the brainchild of the experiences of its creator.  After more than a decade of employment in different companies and industries, different departments and sectors of the businesses, from agriculture to software production, I realized that at the end of the day, one common factor was evident; the desire for career advancement and the fruits and privileges that accompanied the advancement.   To me, everything seemed to revolve around this common factor, Advancement; the economy, lifestyle and life in general all seemed to be a game where the rules were already written and I had to follow them.<br/><br/>With this understanding in mind, I embarked on the arduous task of arranging it all on paper and it wasn&rsquo;t long before I had a complete and playable game.  The circular design of the game was chosen to emphasize the revolving aspect of the game.  I had four gas stations to remind us of both the need for gas and the high gas prices.  I included childcare; a common denominator in our families and most other successful and complete families.  Since we all have to pay taxes, I included a slot for the IRS on the game.  It was abundantly clear that since I got paid once every pay period, then one complete revolution around the board was equivalent to one complete pay period.  Domestic utilities were also included in the game for this was an everyday necessity.<br/><br/>There were several things I could have included in the game such as food and health insurance but I ran out of room.  However, I did include vacation, a common phenomenon at work, whether earned or incidental such as sick time or penalty (suspensions).  The Superior Court was included to provide a platform for one to forward his/ her grievances and concerns and to provide a platform for one to mount their best defense whenever the circumstance arose.<br/><br/>For disciplinary purpose and as an instrument of the constant penalty awaiting the lawbreakers, I included the jail slot on the game.  I also included the INS slot on the game due to the fact that there are numerous undocumented immigrants who masquerade as legal entities hence the need for consistently proving ones eligibility for employment.  As much as I despise paying the high insurance premiums, the state law requires that we maintain auto insurance at all times.  In an effort to keep the game fun and entertaining, I included the mailbox and email as tools to deliver messages, promotions, bonus, and even penalties.<br/><br/>The eight departments, Shipping and Receiving, Production, Assembly, Customer Service, Packaging, Maintenance, Quality Assurance and Management were chosen because I had personal experience in them and I felt that they were crucial to any manufacturing enterprise.  Other departments such as accounting, advertising and marketing though important to a company were not included because I figured that some companies were able to operate profitably by either doubling or outsourcing these departments.<br/><br/>",

A few ads for Virgin Mobile are also included.<br/><br/>In the print runs, players place cards (stories) in front of them, one by one, and thus have a chance to select what stories they publish depending on their opponent's choices, and also affect the game with their Editor's Choices. Scoring is based on how many stories they have from the same set, if they have an exclusive of the news item, or if they were able to ruin another player's exclusive by also publishing a story from their set. The ads also score points. The player with the most points after the 4th print run wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This traditional game of ancient India is described by game historian R.C. Bell as a &quot;square board race game.&quot; The game is played on a 5x5 grid which would have been marked out on the ground. The center space is the castle and the middle squares on each side of the board are serve as a player's palace. Each player uses four small sticks as their pieces. Four tamarind seeds marked with three white sides and three dark sides to function as dice.<br/><br/>The pieces start off the board.    A &quot;1&quot; must be rolled to move a piece onto the board. The pieces first travel counterclockwise around the outside of the board and then travel through the inner nine squares in a clockwise spiral pattern until they reach the castle square at the center of the board. Once all four of a player's pieces have reached the central castle square, the player begins trying to bear them off the board. For each &quot;1&quot; rolled a player may remove one piece from the castle. The first player to remove all four pieces wins the game.<br/><br/>When a player moves onto a square containing the piece or pieces of an opposing player, the opponent's pieces are removed from the board and must start the journey again. However, this rule does not apply to the palace and castle spaces, which are safe havens. In addition, under certain circumstances a player may pair together two pieces as a &quot;twin&quot; which permits them to move together and which may only be sent off the board by another &quot;twin&quot; piece.<br/><br/>A more elaborate form of the game, known as The King's Thayaam, is played on a board double the size and uses eight tamarind seeds as dice instead of four.<br/><br/>This game is similar to the Indian games Saturankam and Ashta-Kashte.<br/><br/>",

Players can land on squares such as &quot;Go to Church,&quot; &quot;Choose the Right,&quot; and &quot;Tithing.&quot; Houses and Hotels are replaced with the ward houses and stake centers (names for Mormon church buildings). Also, all five playing pieces are directly related to Mormonism (CTR Ring, Bee of Deseret, Sunbeam Baby, Scripture Book, Brigham Young's Hat.)<br/><br/>One interesting aspect of the game is that there are nine squares on each side of the board instead of the usual ten.<br/><br/>",

Second, they move to &quot;Desert Storm&quot;, in which they use their cards to overcome obstacles on the board.

        "description": "The Cost of Caring Game for 2-6 players is played on a 23&quot; x 23&quot; quad-fold playing board with players advancing their own pawn by die roll along the 121 spaces (there is one short cut that saves 7 spaces) until all eligible pawns reach &quot;the party.&quot;<br/><br/>A player must draw a Care Card when landing on a Care Station.  There are 60 different Care Cards, each describing the player meeting with a hypothetical person in some type of need.  Each Care Card gives a player two choices: to hurry on to the party, or to go instead to a Cost Station, where the player randomly chooses one of two Cost Cards written specifically for the situation described on that Care Card.  The Cost Card describes the player's resulting caring response and whether it gains the player a Meaning Card and whether it costs the player a Time Token.  When all 6 of a player's Time Tokens are gone, the player is out of the game.<br/><br/>There are 50 different Meaning Cards (plus 5 blank cards) each with a short meaningful statement, such as &quot;care without cost would be worthless.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The game ends when all players [who still have Time Tokens] reach the party&hellip;.  The object is to arrive at the party with the most meaning cards and be declared 'SAINT'.&quot;  There can be only one.<br/><br/>",

Each player chooses one city (New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle or San Francisco) and each game the fires begin in different districts. The mechanics for the spreading of fires can be fierce, luckily players are given some tools to help contain the fires--however the tools are limited, and will not be able to protect all of your city.<br/><br/>Prevent as many fatalities as possible, keep your city from burning completely to the ground, and you just might be able to come out on top!<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, each player creatures four monsters from Play-Doh modeling compound using the provided mold and places them at different locations: School, Community, Playground and Home.  The players then roll dice and move plastic trucks around the board in an effort to capture the monsters and return them to the monster machine at the center of the board.  When a player returns a monster to the machine, he or she talks about something from the monster's source that causes anger, then chooses a &quot;Transformer Card&quot; featuring an appropriate resolution to the anger.  The card directs the player to reform the monster into another shape.  The first player to transform all four of his or her monsters wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The game is scalable from basic addition to algebra with different templates.<br/><br/>From product description:<br/><br/>TIVY is a math board game invented by an Oklahoman. The game is designed to teach strategy and sportsmanship in addition to fundamental mathematics. Each board comes with &quot;tivots&quot; (the game pieces), score sheets, a rule book, and a variety of gamesheets for use from grades three through nine. During game play, players move their tivots, which are numbered, across the board and land in score goals. Each score goal is paired with a math problem that is missing a number. When a player lands a tivot in a score goal, they create a completed math problem by replacing the missing numbers with the number on their tivot. Phases of the game include strategy time, game play time (when the tivots are moved), calculate score time (when players solve the math problems they created), check opponent time (during which players check opponents' work), challenge time (when any disputes are settled), and agree time (when players agree on their final scores).<br/><br/>",

They are a mix of Arab Beduins and Tamazigh (Berber). Their language is mostly an Arab dialect with a strong Tamazigh influence. <br/>Hassaniya-speaking people live in the western Sahara from Niger to Mauritania. They constitute the majority of the population in Mauritania and in the Saharian Arabic Democratic Republic. There are some in Southern Morocco, Algeria, northern Senegal, Mali, and also a few in Niger. This region is called Trab el Bidan, ie. land of white people, in contrast to Bilal al Sudan, or land of black people. <br/>Krur is mostly played by children. <br/>Usually the holes, which are called &quot;houses&quot;, are dug in the sand<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board is made of two rows of four holes. <br/>At the beginning, there are four seeds in each hole.<br/><br/>Each player controls the holes on his side of the board. <br/>On your turn you take all the seeds from any hole of your side of the board and sow them in an anticlockwise sense, one in each hole, starting in the next one. <br/>If you end in an empty hole, it is the end of your turn <br/>If the last seed lands in an occupied hole on the opponent's side, making a total of four seeds, you end your turn and this hole is captured by you. It is marked somehow. <br/>If the last seed lands in an occupied hole all these seeds (the one just landed plus the ones that were already there) are taken up and you keep on sowing starting in the next hole. <br/>You sow seeds in the holes you have captured but not in those captured by your opponent. <br/>You cannot start a sowing from a captured hole. <br/>The winner of the game is the one that, when there are no more seeds in play, has captured more than the opponent.<br/><br/>Usually you don't play just a game, but a match. <br/>On the next game you start filling the holes with the captured seeds. <br/>     The winner fills all his holes with four seeds. <br/>     The looser fills all the holes he can with four seeds. If he has some remaining seeds, he puts them in another hole, but always an even number of them, so he can retain a single seed. <br/>     The empty holes on the loser's side of the board are refilled with sand or marked somehow. In the next game nobody plays in them. <br/>     If the looser has not enough holes to put his seeds, he reopens as many holes as he needs. <br/>     There is no fixed rule about the order to close or reopen the holes. Sometimes they are opened from left to right. However, it is not important to the game. <br/>The winner of the match is the one who captures all the seeds and leaves the opponent with no holes on his side.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mancala game. From: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Pasu_Pondi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Pasu_Pondi</a><br/><br/>&quot;Pasu Pondi (&quot;sweep four&quot;) is an old Indian indoor game mostly played by Tamil women in rural areas of Tamil Nadu, South India. Sometimes it is also played in the open as well. However, the game is usually not played at night. Play often continues for several hours and the players may be surrounded by many spectators who &quot;observe, assist and enthuse&quot; them.<br/><br/>The game was first described by Dr L. S. Saraswathi in 1995.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The game is played on a two rows board. Each row has seven holes.<br/><br/>According to Saraswathi every hole usually contains five seeds at the beginning, although six may be used, too.<br/><br/>On his turn a player distributes the seeds from one of his holes in a clockwise direction into the following holes. When all seeds have been sown, the contents of the next hole are picked up and distributed in another lap.<br/><br/>The turn ends when the last seed falls into a hole which is succeeded by an empty one.<br/><br/>During sowing the contents of any hole that contains exactly four (pasu) seeds are immediately captured by the player who owns the hole.<br/><br/>If, after the turn was finished, the hole following the empty one is occupied, the contents of this hole are captured. This is called pondi (&quot;sweep&quot;).<br/><br/>The game ends when all seeds are on one side of the board.<br/><br/>The remaining seeds are captured by the player who owns their holes.<br/><br/>The winner of a game is the one who captures more seeds.<br/><br/>Pasu Pondi is played in rounds. In the next game, the players fill their holes with the seeds they captured in the previous game. Again, there must be five seeds per hole. These holes which cannot be filled are closed. The play goes on until one of the players cannot fill even one pit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A manqala game. From <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Sat-gol\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.wikimanqala.org/wiki/Sat-gol</a>:<br/><br/>&quot;Sat-gol was described by Professor Hem Chandra Das Gupta. He was the first Indian full-time Professor of Geology at Presidency College, Founder of Geological, Mining and Metallurgical Society and Geological Institute. <br/>The information about sat-gol comes from the village of Gosalpur, in the Jubbulpur district, Central Provinces. <br/>Nowadays Gosalpur is in the Jabalpur district of Madhya Praddesh, in North Central India. <br/>No cultural background is given.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>The board is made of seven circles (note that he doesn't say &quot;holes&quot; but &quot;circles&quot;) arranged in a circle. <br/>At the beginning, there are four stones in each circle. <br/>On your turn you take all the pieces from any circle and sow them in an anticlockwise sense, one in each circle. When you have sown all the pieces on your hand, you take the ones in the next circle and keep on sowing with them. <br/>The turn ends when the last stone is dropped in a circle which is followed by an empty one. <br/>If the empty circle is followed by an occupied one, its contents are captured. <br/>According to the original description it is not permitted to choose the hole from which the move begins. You must take the first non-empty hole after the hole where the opponent finished her last move. This would lead to a single game that would be played exactly the same all the time. V&iacute;ktor Bautista i Roca therefore suggested: <br/>     You can choose from which hole the sowing is started. <br/>     The game ends when both players agree that it is impossible to capture more pieces and the remaining stones are not counted. <br/>According to Murray's misinterpretation of Das Gupta's description &quot;the player captures the contents of the hole beyond, or if there is a sequence of empty holes, the contents of the first loaded hole&quot;. Das Gupta says, clearly, &quot;he will be in possession of the pieces lying within the circle immediately next to the latter&quot;. <br/>The player who captures more pieces wins the game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mini Skittles consists of 10 wooden pins, approximately 2.5 inches in height, and one wooden ball, approximately 1.25 inches in diameter.  The pins are set up by hand on a smooth floor or low-pile carpet.  The ball is used to knock them down.  Instructions are included for three different games. The games can be played by 2-5 individuals or teams with an equal number of players. <br/> Skittles uses nine pins in a diamond formation. Scoring is based on the number of pins knocked down within a given number of throws.<br/><br/>Ten-pin Bowling uses all ten pins in a traditional triangular pattern.  Scoring is based on the number of pins knocked down within ten frames, with bonuses for spares and strikes.<br/><br/>Canadian Five-pin Bowling uses five pins in a vee formation.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes turns driving it through the town, responding to a host of funny, thought-provoking card and Playbook-based questions. Once everybody has driven, the car races toward the finish line (Weekend Wish) to see whose idea of family fun will soon come true.<br/><br/>Family Matters&trade; invites players aged 7+ to share stories, discover trivia, do funny things and creatively explore 140 make-believe, location-based issues (&quot;Fake Family Crises&quot;) from totally new perspectives.<br/><br/>Herding your family into a single room is hard. Convincing them to talk plainly and calmly about personal or emotionally charged topics is next to impossible. As communication, or a lack thereof, has such serious consequences, effectively addressing this kind of stuff - sooner NOT later - matters a lot.<br/><br/>If only there was a way to playfully facilitate self-expression and encourage collaborative conversation...<br/><br/>Enter Family Matters, the game parents will wish their family played when they were kids. And if you&rsquo;re a kid, you&rsquo;ll be glad yours did. <br/>Game Objective<br/><br/>Players pile into the family car, taking turns driving through town, responding to questions and/or tasks along the way. Once everyone has driven, the car races toward the finish line (Weekend Wish) to see whose idea of family fun will soon come true.<br/><br/>Quick Start Guide:<br/><br/>1. Players each write down their &quot;Weekend wish&quot; on Page 10 of the Playbook<br/>2. Players select a peg and place it into the car by age - youngest first, please. <br/>3. The driver parks the car at anyone one of the four possible starting points. <br/>4. The driver rolls the cube to start the car and move it forward. <br/>5. The driver does whatever the space suggests: (i) read/respond to a card that matches the space, (ii) move from one &quot;Black Hole&quot; to another or (iii) resolve, with other passengers, a location based Fake Family Crisis (found on pages 14-41 in the Playbook)<br/>6. See page 6 of the Playbook for instruction on how to resolve a Fake Family Crisis.<br/>7. Only after resolving a Fake Family Crisis is it time to change drivers (and car seats). <br/>8. Once all players have driven, reach takes a turn rolling toward the board's center. <br/>9. The first player to land upon the Weekend Wish space &quot;wins&quot; the game. <br/>10. The entire family must grant the winning player's Weekend Wish.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this promotional board game by Swedish insurance company Skandia, players move around a Monopoly-style board, drawing various types of event cards. They will get the chance to invest in property like cars, houses or diamonds, hoping to sell them at a profit or else convert them to cash at the end of the game. They may also get to purchase tickets in an intermittently triggered lottery (because winning the lottery and speculating in diamonds are the two surest ways of getting rich, or something).<br/><br/>Everything and anything in the game is in danger of damage or accidents, although having the right insurance helps with this. Several of the risk vs. reward elements of the game are easily solvable and serve to encourage behaviour that is illegal or economically irrational in reality, like casino gambling or diamond smuggling, which seems a little odd considering the theme. The game is played for an arbitrary amount of time; the rules suggest playing until a point in time agreed upon in advance is reached, after which five more moves are played out. The player with the most money is then declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scravage is Gin Rummy, crossed with a word game, played with a Scroker deck.  The entire alphabet is represented with the citrus suits, and the scrokers are completely wild (suit and letter).  You can mix the chili pepper suit's vowels with the citrus letters in order to form your words.  The animal suit, however, is sacred, and cannot be commingled with the other suits to form words.  On the other hand, its words will be worth double points.<br/><br/>On your turn, you either acquire a card by drawing one from the deck, or by scravaging (scavenging) one from the discard or an opponent's entire four-letter word.  Then, you play a word if you scravaged, or if you want to.  Finally, you must discard if you didn't go out.<br/><br/>To add spice, there are numerous variants, as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game made to encourage debate before the Swedish referendum in 1994 on joining the European Union. Players roll and move along the game board, triggering various events that include having to quickly look up answers in a book named Mega Express. Along the way they pick up votes to be used in the end game, which takes place after an arbitrary agreed-upon period of time (the rules suggest half an hour or an hour). Each player now casts their accumulated votes either for or against joining the EU, and the totals are added up to show the outcome; the rules envision several concurrent games, the votes from each session being added up to a grand total. It should be noted that the book required for proper use of the game was not packaged with it, may not accompany copies found in thrift shops, and may be difficult to obtain.<br/><br/>",

If a player throws 9 (with a 6 and a 3) he moves to square 26 whereas if he brings 9 (with a 4 and a 5) he moves to square 53.  The player to reach square 63 first, is the winner.  But beware!  There are traps on the way.&quot; (Source: Center of the board)<br/><br/>",

When battle starts, the more powerful unit will defeat the other. The first to reach, and destroy their opponents castle will win the game!<br/><br/>The gameplay is simple. Each player has a castle and a 20-sided die. The die is used as a counter to represent the amount of damage the castle can take before it's destroyed. In order to protect the castle, each player will draw cards. Players will draw creatures with powers of 1 through 5. The higher the number, the more powerful the creature. The creatures are strategically placed in lines using one of 4 horizontal positions in front of the castle. If at any point an &quot;Attack&quot; card is played, the front line of each players army will attack each other in a head to head battle. The creature with higher power will destroy the other. Unused power will be applied to the creature behind the defeated creature. If a player is eventually able to successfully deal damage to another player's castle, the castle takes damage. If a castle is brought to zero, that owner of that castle loses and the game is over.<br/><br/>",

The game teaches seven specific skills that have been proven in the research literature to help impulsive children control their impulses, make good decisions, and avoid actions that are detrimental to themselves and others.<br/><br/>The skills learned in the game are:<br/>-Accepting delayed gratification<br/>-Reading social cues<br/>-Understanding the benefits of impulse control<br/>-Developing positive self talk<br/>-Improving problem solving skills<br/>-Understanding the consequences of impulsive actions<br/>-Improving the ability to stop a behavior<br/><br/>In the game, players drive their cars, making their way through a maze of roads. At each intersection they have to make a decision regarding the best path. Some paths are shorter, but contain various hazards that are represented by road signs. In order to do well in the game, players are forced to delay decisions until the facts and consequences have been considered and to plan ahead. Players have a great time as they learn these impulse control skills and use them to plan and find the best route to their destination.<br/><br/>",

In addition to the standard poker dice, a sixth &quot;action die&quot; is included, which the winner of the hand rolls.  This determines from where the clothing is to be removed (above / below the waist or choice).<br/><br/>The game can be played in multiple ways, including:<br/><br/>- Each player rolls the dice a number of times to construct the best hand.  The player with the lowest scoring poker hand must remove an article of clothing as directed by the sixth die.<br/><br/>- The &quot;liar's dice&quot; variant where you are trying to convince the next player to accept a higher valued roll than the one you received.  Eventually someone will be accused of lying.  In the case of a lie, the &quot;seller&quot; removes an article of clothing as directed by the sixth die, while in the case of the truth it's the accuser who does so.<br/><br/>",

First, players gain cards.  Each card has a 3x3 grid (like the holes on a Yago Pool board) of which 8 of the points are punched.  The cards are stacked in the hand held (that is not fanned, like a traditional card game) so that the solid point on each card can be seen through the cards.  Once a player has the right combination of cards and can create a row, players can then place a chip (red or yellow) on one of the corresponding points on the game board. If a player can cover all five points on the wild card, he may place his chip on any point on the board.<br/><br/>Scoring is via making rows on the main board.  1 point for a line of three chips or placing 5 chips on the board.  Three points if the 5 chips makes 2 lines simultaneously.<br/><br/>",

Spaces on the game board resemble actual places within the city and each space does something for or to the player akin to its real life counterpart.<br/>At the beginning of the game players roll a die twice to determine their starting bankroll. This bankroll is not denoted by any type of token and is instead to be remembered in the players head or on paper. This is important as any player may contest a players bankroll at any time in the game and if it is found to be faulty that player suffers a punishment. Once all players have their bankroll play beings and each player rolls a die to move the indicated number of spaces and take the actions on the space on which they land.<br/>A player wins when they achieve &quot;Nirvanna&quot; which can be achieved by a number of different means as they pass the 9th street bridge space.<br/><br/>",

In this game you must be first to create a line of five pieces.<br/>Each player starts with 20 discs in his own colour. Players alternate to place pieces on to the board. The game ends when any one player has a winning line. However, if no-one has a winning line after all 40 pieces are on the board, players must move one of their own pieces one square. If no-one wins after five such moves, it is a draw.<br/>The pieces are circular discs with a vacant centre and a winning player scores as many points as printed on the board, which can easily be seen throught the middle of the piece. Scores are pegged on a sort of cribbage board.<br/>Essentially a 2-player game, the rules suggests variants for more players, one of which is a Five Drive. This goes back to the fashion for Whist Drives, i.e. a number of tables playing side-by-side, maybe in a village hall or similar.<br/><br/>",

We are proud to be the largest Canadian manufacturer of the hockey puck and the company that developed the NHL formula puck in conjunction with the National Hockey League. We are equally proud to present you with DICE HOCKEY, a game that will give you hours of enjoyment, a sense of competitiveness and the feeling of excitement that the game of ice hockey has to offer.<br/><br/><br/>In Dice Hockey players roll a die to move one of their skaters towards their opponents goal and then follow the directions of the spot they land which usually involves rolling the die again to see if you score, pass, take a penalty or have a breakaway. Rolling the exact number to have your skater land exactly in the goal crease will score you a goal and end the period. The game board is set into the box bottom so you pop the top of the box and play in the box. The boards surrounding the ice surface are covered with advertising images straight form 1993 including Hubba Bubba bubble gum. ",

This game is a hybrid of Groups and Lines of Action, on a smaller board and utilizing shifting lines of pieces.  As players shift pieces, they may end up pushing pieces of either player off the board, and out of play.  This reducing of pieces is a double-edged sword, as it both weakens a player, but also pushes them closer to possibly winning the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game with cards that have phrases that relate to car racing. The cards give and take away points during several races (rounds). The winning player has the most points at the conclusion of the racing season (agreed upon number of rounds).<br/><br/>Card draws determine racing team designation and order of play.  The player begins a turn by rolling a custom die to determine how many &quot;race&quot; cards to draw. The player must immediately use or discard all cards drawn.  There are rules that determine hierarchy among the cards. There are no choices to make, simply follow the card text and hierarchy rules.<br/><br/>The &quot;Black Flag&quot; card causes a player to miss two turns.    The &quot;Go Behind the Wall&quot; card causes a player to immediately discard all cards until a &quot;Return from Behind the Wall&quot; card is drawn. It is a fact that in car racing the &quot;Black Flag&quot; causes a car to withdraw from the race for any number of reasons.  And a car goes behind the wall when it requires more repair than is allowed in a pit stop.  It is rare for a car to return to the race and some leagues do not allow a car to return to the race.<br/><br/>The game comes in an appropriately sized box that is sturdy with attractive graphics.  There is a box insert for the components, the finger holds allow 1/3 of the cards to be removed. The cards are made from 90 Lb paper and have neither linen content nor plastic coating. The 1 inch custom die has images that are printed on the surface. The instruction booklet is in the list format without reference numbers and the order of the rules is not in relation to game play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Developed by a real-life fur trapping couple, Fur Out was marketed as Canada's first &quot;family wildlife game.&quot;<br/><br/>The game, not just a simple roll and move affair, features three different types of characters (Trappers, the Game Warden, &amp; the Anti-Trapper). Trappers set traps and score points by catching &amp; selling furs. As they accumulate wealth, trappers can buy and build cabins on the board to set trap-lines to make even more money. Trappers can also tamper with each others traps and even steal them. However, if the Game Warden (only one allowed per game) catches them they can end up in jail. The Game Warden is also a trapper, so he can cash in on any poached game he seizes, as well as set traps himself. (However, as a lawman the Game Warden can't tamper with other player's traps.) The Anti-Trapper (only one allowed per game) scores by stealing traps from the Trappers and generally making life miserable for them.<br/><br/>Players navigate the unusual snowshoe-shaped board by rolling 2 six-sided dice and traveling along the showshoe's webbing. Different spots on the board allow players to set up traps for various game animals. (These spots are always on the edges of diamond or hexagonal areas that frame the illustration of the animal to be trapped.) Some animal hides are virtually worthless (like the lowly Skunk) while others pay top dollar (like the mighty Grizzly Bear). Only one trap may be set per square. A player must return to the square by landing on it with an exact die roll to successfully make a catch. Unfortunately, other players that land on the square may &quot;steal&quot; a catch from the trap. However, the offending player may be sent to jail for poaching if the Game Warden lands on the spot while they're still there.<br/><br/>Initially trappers are restricted to the first level of the board, but when they successfully trap an animal, they may progress another level down the board, repeating the process as they bag bigger and better game. Cards from the Fur In deck (collected when traps catch animals) make movement, and therefore scoring, more predictable. Cards from the Fur Out deck (collected when larger traps catch bigger animals) allow players to slowly collect letters to spell out the names of the animals with the biggest ticket furs... and to eventually make top dollar. A deck of event cards, name Yellowhead Cards (after the nickname of a famous Iroquois trapper/trader named Pierre Bostonais) can significantly alter a player's turn. This deck is activated by landing on particular spaces spread around the board. (Interestingly, the Anti-Trapper player is instructed to interpret the Yellowhead Cards to the best of his ability from his perspective. Some Yellowhead Cards simply won't apply to the Anti-Trapper.)<br/><br/>Players are allowed to trade or sell any in-game items to each other. This even applies to things like players combining Fur Out cards so that they can divide up a big score.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players can buy Cabins to effectively take over certain game spaces for themselves. However this becomes an attractive target for the Anti-Trapper who'll want to burn the cabin down (as long as he can stay out of reach of the Game Warden).<br/><br/>The game may be played to a time limit (Trapping Season) or to any other method of conclusion that they players can agree on. The winner is the player with highest cash value of combined resources (traps, cabins, and, of course, furs) when the game ends.<br/><br/>The game includes the following components:<br/>- 1 Showshoe Playing Board<br/>- 7 Colored Playing Tokens<br/>- 6 Colored Sets of 50 Traps each<br/>- 10 Wooden Trappers Cabins<br/>- 1 Pair of Dice<br/>- 3 Different Sets of Cards (Fur In, Fur Out, &amp; Yellowhead)<br/>- 1 Pad of FUR Out Scoresheets<br/>- 1 FUR OUT Rules Booklet<br/>- 1 FUR OUT Player Aid Sheet<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to spend all your earned money, accumulate 8 hours of time cards, and go to your apartment.<br/><br/>The game is played by moving your pawn over a mapboard, showing the city of Vienna, overlayed with a grid. On your turn, you may move your pawn one or two spaces by foot, or three or four spaces by taxi, the latter costs money. You try to visit event locations (like Rosie's Caf&eacute;, your band's rehearsal room, a hot dog booth and various others). On most spaces you have to draw cards, which will help you to spend money and acquire time cards.<br/><br/>The trick is to keep the right balance between spending money and acquiring time cards. You need at least 8 hours worth of time cards, then you can try to get to your apartment and win the game - but only if you have no money left.<br/><br/>This game's pawns represent members of a locally known band in Austria; the title is Viennese slang and translates to &quot;night shift&quot;.<br/><br/>",

This is followed by a blank, then another blank and then a phrase again. You have to think of a word that goes into the first blank, thus forming two words 'with a close relationship'. Then you need to complete the second blank and make another word that links to the last phrase in your question. The trick is, the two blank words must rhyme. An example; A pool is the first word so the correct word to go with that is Lagoon. The last phrase is Very Light Ball and the correct answer is Balloon. Lagoon/Balloon is correct and rhymes.<br/>Game 3 is a quick trivia game. You are given a grid of five by six boxes.

Players use a spinner to travel around the board collecting letters of the alphabet, which are associated with particular spaces. The spaces are shown as balloons. Landing on a space with a letter on it allows the player to collect that letter. Landing on a black balloon allows a player to take a letter from anywhere on the board. Landing on a purpler balloon allows the player to steal a letter from another player. A player is &quot;stung&quot; and must return a card to the board if he or she lands on a spot showing the Alpha-Bee.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player lands on the Finish spot with an exact spin. At that point all players count up there cards. The player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>This title appears to take some inspiration from Candyland.<br/><br/>",

Players learn standards for ethical behavior and how to discriminate ethical from unethical behavior. Ethical situations covered include relations with employers, co-workers, customers, and suppliers. Playing the game demonstrates to the students that unethical behavior can hurt other employees, the company, and themselves.<br/><br/>In the game, players are in the role of company presidents. They are responsible for the success of the company. Throughout the game problems are brought to them that involve the behavior of their employees. Players must decide (1) whether the fictitious employee's behavior was ethical or unethical, and (2) what punishment to give (if the behavior was unethical). The situations are designed so that they are not easy to decide. Players see that unethical employees prevent them from winning the game, and they take steps to move these employees out of their companies.<br/><br/>",

However you are limited in the actions you can take and will have to fight off the other players.<br/><br/>The game was inspired by random comments on the BGG chat feed for Essen 2011.

        "description": "Card game for children aged around 10 years old. There are rules to four games using the cards.<br/><br/>Game 1: Qui, quoi, quand?<br/>A game for 2 players<br/>The cards are shuffled and placed in a stack in the centre of the table. On a turn, the player takes the top card and looks at the picture and the text on the other side of the card. From this, he or she must guess the correct historical period for the card e.g. L&eacute;onard de Vinci would be a La Renaissance card. Then check the summary card. If correct, he scores a point. If not, the card is discarded and the opponent has a turn. When all the cards have been used, the one with the most points, wins.<br/><br/>Game 2: L'ordre chronologique<br/>Cards are dealt out evenly. The remaing cards are placed in a stack. A card is revealed and the player must lay a card that goes immediately before the date on that card or just after it. If you cannot play a card, you must pass and take a card from the stack and add it to your hand. The first player to use all their cards, wins.<br/><br/>Game 3: Qui suis-je?<br/>Stack all the cards with only the picture side showing. Each player, in turn, takes the top card and tries to name the event, person, etc. The card is then turned over to reveal the text. If the player is correct, he keeps the card. If not, it is discared. The player with the most cards when the stack is emptied, wins.<br/><br/>Game 4: 9 Familles<br/>The cards are colour coded so a straightforward version of 7 Familles/Happy Families can be played. Each set collected is worth one point for every card in that set. When all the sets are played out, the winner is the one with the most points.<br/><br/>",

As the sticks get higher, it becomes increasingly more difficult. The sticks are rounded like a straw which increases the difficulty level even higher.<br/><br/>Three dice decide which colours you need to take. Red sticks are the longest, blue sticks are medium length and green are the smallest.<br/><br/>Your turn is against the clock so you need to be pretty fast. If you knock down the stick tower, you lose that game. Play as many games as you want and the winner is the one with fewest losses.<br/><br/>",

In the first phase, players roll a die to move around a wheel trying to get rid of hand cards which symbolize the negative qualities of hate, anger, deceit, greed, and attachment. They can get rid of their cards by landing on appropriate spaces; this may involve giving the cards to other players or discussing a time they used that quality in a situation.<br/><br/>Once a player has gotten rid of all hadga cards and crossed the Rainbow Bridge, the second phase of the game begins for that player. Now the player rolls the die to move around the Mastery Oval, which contains the letters of the word mastery. Each turn, the player has the chance to earn a letter of the word mastery by answering a trivia question. The first person to receive all seven letters of mastery wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dice have rebel!<br/>They don't want to be a mere accessory that can be rolled carelessly. They propose a game where they are the main characters. There will be two factions. Each faction will organize itself on one side of a chessboard. The number of the dice will be its strength, and it will change every time it's moved. The strong will eliminate the weak.<br/><br/>And the battle starts at the cry of &quot;Alea non jacta est&quot;<br/><br/><br/>In Artaban, each player controls seven 6-sided dice and a Leader Die (Which is just another 6-sided dice, but bigger than the other ones), for a total of 8 dice. The game starts with each player placing his dice on their second nearest row of the chessboard. (The face-up number of a die is its &quot;value&quot;. At the start of the game, sum of the values on the 8 dice must be 28). The objective is to move the dice to their last line of the board. To achieve so, players alternate turns where they have four available options:<br/><br/>1. Move a die left, right, or to the front by flipping the dice over (The top face ends being the left/right/front face respectively).<br/>2. Turn a dice 90&ordm; to the left or the right (without changing the topmost face).<br/>3. Capture an opposing die by placing a die (without turning/flipping it) on a square it could legally move to, but is occupied by an opposing die of less value (The Leader Die can capture dice of less and equal value, but can be captured just like any other die). [A variant allows dice to capture diagonally]<br/>4. Sacrifice a die by &quot;capturing&quot; an opposing die of the same value (Leader Die cannot be sacrificed). The opposing die is not retired (This helps speeding the game).<br/><br/>Other Rules:<br/>-No two dice can occupy the same square at the same time.<br/>-A die cannot move back or diagonally (Except to capture an opposing die when using the variant).<br/>-The game ends when no player can move any dice OR a player proposes a tie and it's accepted by the other.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the face-up value of all dice at their last line is counted, and the player with the bigger score is the winner. If there is a tie, the player with most dice on his last line is the winner. If there still is a tie, the player with most dice on the board is the winner. If there is still a tie, then the game ends in a tie.<br/><br/>",

It is up to each player to arrange the tiles in whatever order they would like. Each tile has a gold or silver <br/>back. Flip a gold tile over to take (1) eggnog from any other player when landed on. Flip a silver tile over for a lose one-turn event when landed on. Players can have any number of <br/>these gold or silver game pieces on the game board to vary the player experience. The more colored pieces played the more action during the game. The stealing of eggnog from other players gives the game more drama and fun.<br/><br/>Each player gets a market shop (tin house) to place at the end of the game pieces. The market shopis to be placed near the last tile leading to the eggnog stash. Place one Santa hat into each market shop. Players can also have someone place candy or even money in <br/>one or more shops during the pregame setup, making sure no one sees which shop has the extra prizes. This leads to a fun surprise bonus if the winning player also has extra treats in their market shop.<br/>Players move via a dice-rolling mechanic, while play is influenced by pre-play tile placement and tile-specific actions. Players also may take opportunities to steal other players' token during play.<br/><br/>",

The form of the questions is that 3 possible answers are read out so even the youngest family member can have a blind guess with a 33% chance of success.<br/><br/>The starting player takes a card and rolls the die. The result indicates which question to be asked. He asks the question to the player on his left. If the correct answer is given, the answering player takes the card and now it is his turn to ask a question to the player on his left, and so on. If a question should be answered incorrectly, the player who gave the wrong answer takes the card, rolls the die and asks the player to his left a question. (which could be the same one of course).<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to secure four cards.<br/><br/>",

Two, three or four players can take part, so choose which of the winds you&rsquo;d like to be, set the spinner on the yellow centre of the blue circle and your game is ready.<br/><br/>Give each player a small counter, which should be placed on the circle marked 1 of the side he has chosen. The players then take turns to spin the arrow (it can be spun by the fingers or blown round). Before a player can start he must score number 6 on the blue circle. After that, any figure which he scores gives the number of circles he can move his counter. For example, if the arrow stops at 4, move the counter four circles, if it stops at 2, move two circles. The game goes on in this manner until one of the players reaches his circle marked 12 and is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Throw the die to see who kicks off first - highest begins. Then each player throws and moves in turn. When a player lands on the tail of an arrow he moves directly to the head of that arrow. The white arrows are good passes and take you more quickly to the goal. The black ones are free-kicks awarded against you and take you farther from the goal. If one player lands on top of another, this is a foul and he must go back 7 positions.<br/><br/>To score a goal, you must throw the exact number required to reach the &lsquo;Goal&rsquo; circle. If a number is thrown that is too many, you must go backwards for the number left over and await your next turn before you can shoot again . . . and so on until you get the exact number to score.<br/><br/>Try seeing how many goals you can score against a friend in half-an-hour (you can, of course, make it longer if you like). You might also form a local league, but if so all games should be the same period. Whatever the time-limit, the most goals, wins.<br/><br/>",

Outsiders do their best to not to let the leaders succeed - and their efforts may take them to an unexpected conclusion.<br/><br/>The key feature of the game is its cooperation system: sharing resources, fair judgement and communicative skills will eventually make you the top guy on the block.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A 50s boardgame themed on the Jewish rights to settle in the promised land of Palestine (&quot;Kanaans land&quot;, &quot;Jews land&quot;). Players move their token on a classical 50s map of Palestine, and scores points as they reach different cities and locations on the map. Winner is the player with highest score after 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Players move on the board from directions given by the David star; players spin the David star, mounted on a large paper clip, each turn, and move on the board accordingly, as the David star tells you both which direction to go, and how far you should go. The rule book states where this location is mentioned in the bible, and how many points you get from entering this location.<br/><br/>As a game published with a clearly political intension, it is quite ironic to find the 1948 UN map of Israel as a part of the rule book.<br/><br/>Advanced version is to point in what part of the bible this location is mentioned. The game is in Norwegian, published by Karmel.<br/><br/>",

AVOID THE POOP! If a player rolls 3 poops, their turn is over and they get NO points for the monkeys they have collected.<br/><br/>Monkeys can be rewarded with bananas to clean up poop for you, increasing your chances of winning.&quot;<br/><br/>There are twelve identical dice in Monkey Dice. There are three results on each die: Monkey (3 sides), poop (2), and banana (1).<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they will roll three of the dice. After rolling they keep monkeys and poop, then decide what to do with the bananas: they can re-roll them during the next set or keep them. If a player keeps a total of three bananas they can eliminate one poop they have collected.<br/><br/>The player continues by rolling another three dice, or stopping their turn. When they stop, they count the total number of monkeys they have collected and add that to their score. If they rolled three poops, their turn is over and lose the points they currently collected.<br/><br/>When a player reaches 50 points, the current round is finished, and they player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the game itself:<br/><br/>&quot;Polite Pigs will familiarize children with the etiquette of responding appropriately in a variety of social situations. It is also designed to reinforce and habituate these responses through verbal repetition. Parents should enjoy hearing their children repeatedly ask and give permission to proceed as the game is played. The object of the game is to capture the most situation cards with the appropriate polite responses.&quot;<br/><br/>Gameplay description:<br/><br/>Cards are dealt to each player (child). The remaining cards form a draw pile. The dealer turns cards over from the draw pile until s/he reaches a &quot;situation&quot; card. (Others are mixed back into the pile.)<br/><br/>The dealer announces the situation and the youngest player (presumably to help children learn politeness and pragmatics starting at a young age) figures out whether s/he has the appropriate response card. If so, s/he says so and takes the situation card as a matched pair with his/her response card.<br/><br/>Else, the player takes a draw card and further, the game's rules require the child state, &quot;Now you try, please&quot; and the next player or opponent to respond, &quot;Thank you&quot; as an additional method of reinforcing politeness. If the next player has the corresponding response card, s/he may claim the pair. Otherwise, s/he draws a card and play continues so on and so forth.<br/><br/>If a player is able to match a response card to a situation card, s/he become dealer. A series of formalistic polite exchanges must be had between the players and if any player forgets the appropriate phrase, such as, &quot;May I give you a situation, please?&quot; then the offending player must hand his opponent a response card or draw until he gets one to hand over.<br/><br/>The winner is the one with the most pairs.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this game focuses not only on physical game mechanics but social dynamics to reinforce its educational affect. The rules take into account that the players may fail to say required phrases, something akin to&mdash;but more complex than&mdash;the requirement in UNO to declare &quot;&iexcl;Uno!&quot; with one card left in hand.<br/><br/>",

The dice is then thrown to decide which player is to start; other players follow in a clock&not;wise direction. In their turn players throw the dice and move their pawn the number of spaces indicated by the dice. Moves may be made backwards or forwards around or across the diagonal paths. If the &lsquo;pawn&rsquo; lands on a letter, the player takes a matching letter from the letter tiles. Should the pawn land on a Gold Star he may take any letter he wishes; but if the pawn lands on a Black Spot the player must return a vowel card from those he has won back to the general pile; if he has not yet gained a vowel, he must owe it and return it when he obtains one.<br/>The object of the game is to form words from the tiles collected. For the younger child it can be to make simple three letter words such as CAT&mdash;MAT&mdash;COT&mdash;CUP and so on. It should be decided beforehand the number of words (say six) and the first to do so being the winner.<br/><br/>It is also a game which may be played with enjoyment by much older children. In this case a point value is given to the length of the word. 3 letter words, 5 points; 4 letter words, 10 points; 5 letter words, 15 points; 6 and over letter words, 20 points. In this case it must be decided beforehand the number of points to be played for (say 100); the first player to do so being the winner. Words already formed may be added to such as MAT to MATS or MATCH; but no word already laid may be re-arranged.<br/><br/>",

As that game is in the public domain, this adaption is placed in the public domain as well.<br/><br/>The game captures the spirit of the first text adventure: the feel of exploring, mapping, and navigating a new world, while trying to find the items that will solve the puzzles.<br/><br/>To setup, you deal location cards face down to form 3 levels of the cave: each level is a 5 by 5 grid. The entrance chamber is placed in the center of the first level and players' pawns start there.<br/><br/>From a location card, players can only travel in directions indicated by the location, moving to one permitted adjacent card and exploring that location. Sometimes they encounter obstacles (&quot;A fierce green snake bars the way!&quot;) and have to turn back unless they have the current item; typically they encounter new regions of the cave (&quot;You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike. [Lose a turn!]&quot;), some of which allow them to choose from an item deck (&quot;There is a shiny brass lamp nearby&quot;). The cave is confusing and complex - often you can't simply return to a location you recently left, but must plot a course through other regions or levels to get there. Magic words will take you up and down levels of the cave.<br/><br/>To win, players race to be the first to score 100 points in items collected and puzzles solved or solve the end game puzzle before anyone else.<br/><br/>",

A numbered question is determined by flicking the spinner, and the player answers that question from the top card on the draw pile.<br/><br/>When a correct answer is given, the player places a Bafflewink on the same number in the column under its subject heading on his Baffleboard. If there is a Bafflewink already on that spot, the player must answer a question from the next card, otherwise play passes to the next player on the left.<br/><br/>A Baffleboard is basically a 5x5 bingo card, but only the player who answered the question correctly places a Bafflewink on his Baffleboard.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>20 different Baffleboards<br/>200 different Bafflecards- 40 each in one of 5 subjects<br/>105 Bafflewinks (small red transparent discs)<br/>1 spinner<br/>1 set of rules<br/><br/>Bible Bafflers, Jr. may be played along with the original Bible Bafflers game.

Each player plays with only 10 Bafflewinks.

        "description": "Crane...Claw...Rip-Off...Thief...it is known by many names throughout history, but the infamous game is still the same in concept: insert cash, use a joystick/buttons to move a metal hand or claw mechanism, then press another button to drop it to see if you snag a prize! Sadly, more times than not, that shiny new toy slips out of the fingers, or misses completely, leading the victim to try insert more cash and repeat these steps.<br/><br/>The Unstable Crane Game is an up to 4-player, simultaneous rendition of this traditional arcade game, where the players each place their &quot;claw tokens&quot; over the various prizes on the table and wait to see if they snag it. Each round, the players flip the top cards of their Player decks, and either get to move their claw, drop their target, or claim their prize according to their card. The first player to achieve a Prize collection worth at least 10 points will be declared the winner! Good luck...<br/><br/><br/>    Notes*<br/><br/><br/>1. There are 3 kinds of cards in each player's deck for simulating their claw's behavior: &quot;Not Yet&quot; (they still have time and may move their claw over another prize.), &quot;Oops! Unlucky!&quot; (their claw snagged a prize, but dropped it while attempting to lift or carry it.), or &quot;You Got It!&quot;(the player's claw successfully claimed a Prize.)<br/><br/>2. Multiple players can try for the same prize. However, since the actions determined by each player flipping the card of their Player Deck occur at roughly the same time, should multiple players draw their &quot;You got it&quot; card in the same round and be over the same prize, their claws instead interfere with each other and play resumes as if they'd dropped the prize instead!<br/><br/>3. &quot;Set collection&quot; is also used lightly in this game. Should a player claim at each 3 prizes that share a type, that player is considered an &quot;enthusiast&quot; and each prize of that type in their collection is worth an additional point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beastie Bash! isn&rsquo;t just a card game for kids, it&rsquo;s outside-the-box thinking -- in a box.<br/><br/>WHAT IS BEASTIE BASH<br/>Beastie Bash! is a silly character creation game for 1-4 players. It&rsquo;s 20 minutes of family fun created by children&rsquo;s book author/illustrator, Eric Wight.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br/>Combine the highest scoring HEAD card with a BODY card to win the cards for that round. The game winner is the player who collects the most Beasties.<br/><br/>WHO IS BEASTIE BASH! FOR?<br/>Beastie Bash! is for kids with wild imaginations. For families who prefer silly to serious. For parents &amp; educators who think the world needs innovators, not fill-in-the-bubblers.<br/><br/>THE BIRTH OF BEASTIE BASH! <br/>The concept for Beastie Bash! was inspired by Eric Wight&rsquo;s experiences as both a parent and a children&rsquo;s book author. His favorite hobby is playing games with his kids. So he thought it would be fun to create a game they could all play together. But that was just the beginning.<br/><br/>&ldquo;This past year, my daughter was diagnosed with dyslexia. As I was designing Beastie Bash! I realized that this game could also be a fun tool to help her improve her reading and math skills. We can play it for hours and it doesn&rsquo;t feel like homework to her. Plus, by mixing up the cards, the text is continually changing.&rdquo;<br/><br/>As an author, Eric has the opportunity to travel around the world teaching kids what it&rsquo;s like to create stories for a living. At these events, students brainstorm ideas for new adventures, which Eric illustrates on the spot.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The kids always have so many cool ideas that it&rsquo;s tough to choose just one. So I thought it would be fun to mash a few together. I could never have predicted how much it made the students and teachers laugh. I realized I was onto something, and set out to create a game that captured that same creative, unpredictable humor.&rdquo;<br/><br/>RULES OF PLAY<br/><br/>SET UP<br/>2 - 4 players. Shuffle the deck. Evenly divide the cards face down to each player. No peeking!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>Each player draws 5 cards from their pile. Pair a HEAD and BODY combination to make the highest score possible and place it in front of you. A color match earns an additional +5 points, a MEGA-MATCH earns +10 points and a &quot;TRUE MATCH&quot; (i.e.: the original head and body combination) earns double points.<br/><br/>POWER PRIZES<br/>Once everyone has revealed their Beastie, players may improve their chance of winning by using a POWER PRIZE card if they possess one. Begin with the player who has the lowest scoring Beastie and continue clockwise. The player with the highest scoring Beastie wins all of the Beasties from this round. Discard the used POWER PRIZE cards.<br/><br/>THE BOOM! CARD<br/>The BOOM! card is very powerful and may be played at any time. When a player uses a BOOM! card, it scares away all of the Beasties. Everyone's cards are discarded no matter what their point value is or what POWER PRIZE cards are being used. Bummer!<br/><br/>TIE-BREAKER<br/>If at the end of the round the score is tied, players may draw enough cards to refill their hand and play another Beastie. Repeat until the tie is broken.<br/><br/>NO PAIRS<br/>If you are unable to make a pair with your cards, you must:<br/><br/>1. Discard 2 cards from your hand.<br/><br/>2a. Use the top 2 cards from your collected Beastie pile.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>2b. Draw 2 cards from your unused deck. If you draw two cards from your unused deck, you must discard all 5 cards AND lose your turn. At the beginning of the next round you may draw 5 new cards.<br/><br/>ENDING THE GAME<br/>The game ends when the first player runs out of cards. Count how many Beasties you collected. The player with the most wins!<br/><br/>ALTERNATE GAME PLAY<br/>1-player: Similar to a traditional match game. Place all the cards face down. The object is to find the Power Prizes before you find the Boom! cards. Turn them over two at a time to find Power Prizes. Once you find a character match, it can be removed from the board. If you flip over 4 Boom! cards, you lose.<br/><br/>LEVEL-UP WITH LEARNING<br/>Beastie Bash! isn&rsquo;t just fun to play, it&rsquo;s also a great tool for learning both at home and in the classroom.<br/><br/>READING: Each card contains funny flavor text that brings the characters to life. With each new match, the text changes, creating countless new reading experiences.<br/><br/>MATH: Kids practice addition skills as they play each round of the game. Older kids can multiply instead of add to make the math more challenging.<br/><br/>WRITING: Create your own adventures using the mix-and-match cards as writing prompts.<br/><br/>",

The inspiration for this project came to me from my childhood adoration for Pok&eacute;mon cards,etc; and the minimalistic design and approach pay homage to Hanafuda&rsquo;s beauty and simplistic brilliance.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Mirrors plays much like a game of Rock-Paper-Scissors in that there is a power hierarchy in which Triangle beats X, X beats Circle, and Circle beats Triangle. [...] Both players will flip their cards at the same time and who ever has the dominant Happening Symbol, wins, and is given the choice to either inflict damage upon their opponent or to use their card&rsquo;s special effect. The amount of damage a card can inflict is indicated by a card&rsquo;s Energy which is the whole number located under the symbol. In the case that both players play the same Happening symbol they are to look at the decimal number under the Energy. This number is the cards Gravity, and whoever has the highest Gravity, wins the that match. Players repeat this until one player&rsquo;s Ego Points are reduced to zero.<br/><br/>",

Will your tribe reign supreme in this savage contest for survival?<br/><br/>Game play alternates between the players. On your turn, you have a choice of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Rapine, pillage or plunder (RPP)<br/>    Move<br/>    Discard a card<br/><br/><br/>The cards serve the three above purposes. Most of the time, players will move to villages and perform RPP. Sometimes, however, when a barbarian tribe gets a little cocky, a battle will occur between the players. These are settled smoothly using the symbols on the cards in hand, and rest assured--tribute will be paid by the loser!<br/><br/>I designed Rapine, Pillage &amp; Plunder because I feel there's a dearth of fun, light, yet not-too-simple two-player games. I believe that this game helps fill that void. (Publishers take note). It's a simple game aimed at casual gamers but has enough in the way of tactics and choices to appeal to more seasoned gamers, as well.<br/><br/>",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.<br/><br/>Another version of the classic Monopoly. This time the cases represent the company Lilly Pulitzer.<br/><br/>",

Players need to spend their recruiting power wisely, balancing their efforts for each of the four service branches: Army, Navy, Marines and Air Force. It&rsquo;s an advantage to recruit the most people, and it&rsquo;s an advantage to recruit the best people. But that&rsquo;s just the beginning, since allocating your recruits to hotspots around the globe is even more important, and... there are two ways to play!<br/><br/>In the standard game, there are two decks: one with all the Recruiting Power cards plus two Special cards, and the other with all the Recruit cards. Each player gets a hand of Recruiting Power cards, which are used to sway (i.e., buy) recruits which are constantly coming and going throughout the peak recruiting season. After this first part of the game, 2 VPs are awarded to the player with the most recruits. Then, four further and crucial competitions between the players will take place, and the player who best allocates his/her recruits to the aforementioned hotspots will earn the most VPs and win the game.<br/><br/>The &quot;friendly&quot; version of the game is a lighter, press your luck design, with unfortunate results for a too-greedy player.<br/><br/>",

Two railroad lines, one starting in California and the other in Iowa, set out to create a seriously divided nation&rsquo;s first transcontinental railroad. In The Golden Spike, two players take on the role of a railroad magnate, building half of this famous accomplishment in transportation. It&rsquo;s a race, to be sure, and the first player to reach Promontory Summit, Utah gains prestige and bonus money. However, the winner of the game is the player who makes the most profit along the way, which requires a delicate balance of planning and cunning.<br/><br/>Players alternately select three-card stacks from a row of them, with only one of the three cards visible. These allow the players to perform various actions, such as hiring workers and buying materials, both needed in the construction of the railroad sections they'll need to complete to get to Promontory Summit... and sometimes men and materials may be hoarded and in short supply. If an Inspector appears when turning over a face-down card, a turn ends immediately and no actions are executed. Three terrain types present a quandary for both players: faster construction or greater profits.<br/><br/>",

For the first time this game is supplied with 12 full teams!<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>This is a game for two players where each player mans a team of eighteen players, eleven of which are on the pitch at any one time. Each team tries to score goals in the oppositions net. As with real football the game is split into two halves of 45 minutes with a break in between, with teams swapping ends at half time.<br/><br/>The game uses player piece positioning as well as D6 dice to create some randomness, in the form of &quot;scattering&quot; the ball a random direction. Players move their pieces up to a specified amount and if they are next to the piece with the ball may tackle.<br/><br/>Rules, tables and diagrams for throw-ins, dribbling, kicking, shooting and other football terms are included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Hunted is a game which takes place in Medieval Times when fear of the supernatural was rampant. What&rsquo;s worse is that the supernatural could be hidden in any disguise a friend, a brother, a son. The community leaders would do just about anything to keep the seed of heresy from spreading in their communities. This incidentally, is where our &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; come in.<br/><br/>Players are normal townspeople who have been given magical powers and abilities from a Mystical Benefactor. They have been given one objective in return for their newfound power: Chaos.<br/><br/>They must take care however, if they are caught there are dire consequences for stepping outsided of society&rsquo;s boundries. Even if they manage to evade the notice of the authorities, the community will react in greater force to the strange happenings, the inexplicable bad fortune that seems to have befallen the town and the disappearances. Can our troublemakers complete their mission of disrupting a community or will they be rooted out by the powers that be? Will they become the hunters or... The Hunted?<br/><br/>The Game:<br/><br/>Mystical Benefactors<br/>There are currently 8 Mystical Benefactors to choose from for a given campaign. Each has their own special abilities and unique spells when they are active. This makes The Hunted have great replayability.<br/><br/>Avoid Suspicion<br/>Players attempt to complete the objective, take down all three Authority Figures, while pretending to live a normal life. Players must pay taxes (10 Coins every Tuesday) and generally just stay out of trouble whilst carrying out their hazardous misdeeds.<br/><br/>Chaos<br/>To grow stronger, players must commit disruptive acts upon the community to earn Chaos Points. Chaos Points are used to purchase Spells and Familiars (Animals bound to you by the Dark Benefactor that will obey your every order.) Chaos Points can be earned by:<br/><br/>Destroying property Converting villagers to join your cult Sacrificing Animals and villagers Taking down Authority Figures And other generally blasphemous thingsPlayers can work together or separately to gain Chaos Points. However, at the end of one week, the player who has earned the most Chaos points is rewarded greatly by the Dark Benefactor, while the player who earns the least is punished. This adds an element of competitiveness to the general cooperative spirit of the game.<br/><br/>Paranoia<br/>Should a character be noticed doing something strange, they will gain Paranoia Points. Paranoia Points indicate how suspicious the villagers are of that player being a heretic. Players will have increasingly harsh sanctions set against them as their paranoia score rises, such as the townspeople watching them more closely or their house being searched for heretical paraphernalia, eventually ending in their execution for heresy. Players can reduce Paranoia by doing things that are expected of them, like going to church or being a nice person, these things usually come at the cost of Chaos Points, bringing a delicate balance of Paranoia and Chaos that players must manage. Typically, it is best to be able to not be noticed or to be able to talk your way out of a dicey situation.<br/><br/>Even if players do manage not to be noticed, villagers will begin to notice the unexplained happenings, the disappearances, and the downright spooky things that seem to be happening around them lately. The village itself has a Paranoia score that raises when something cannot be explained or something clearly supernatural happens. When this score rises, the Authority Figures become increasingly frantic to find and kill the heretics among them. Lowering the Town Paranoia can be difficult, so players must take care with their actions. If the Town Paranoia is too high, for too long, the village will be purged by the Church and the players lose the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Space, 2099.  Interstellar, black market commerce is commonplace. In Sector Beta-3, the search is on for minerals among the asteroids (endearingly called 'roids by you and your fellow miners). Your small mining craft will move swiftly through sixteen sub-sectors and collect six types of minerals, as efficiently as possible. The planets in the sector have different demands for minerals, so you must plan your movements and schedule accordingly. Even in this day and age fuel is an issue, and you'll have to call in a supply ship and pay with one of your completed contracts or convert uranium ore into fuel. Other minerals can be used for other purposes as well, although it's usually better to deliver them for profit&hellip; and don&rsquo;t forget to watch out for the Space Police!<br/><br/>'Roid Miner is a light game with minimal rules which can be played seriously or as a beer-and-pretzels game. How is this possible, you ask skeptically? Because the game's design and mechanics lend themselves to &quot;planning/looking-ahead/what-if-he-does-that&quot; play  or &quot;instinctive&quot; play--or anything in-between. In other words, you can play 'Roid Miner in tournament mode or just for fun. Due to the random setup, every game will different. Sometimes you and your opponent will easily spot nice &quot;chains&quot; of pickup and delivery, and your scores will be high. In other games, both of you will struggle to make it into double digits. Sometimes you'll keep to yourselves and sometimes you'll &quot;have at&quot; each other. The best part is that no matter how the game unfolds, 'Roid Miner will always take only about a half-hour to play--and I'm betting you'll set it up for a second game every time.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to have the best reputation for philanthropy and social justice.<br/><br/>As in Monopoly, any player landing on an industry space owned by another player must pay the owner. However, a player may become &quot;the best in their industry&quot; by giving up their move and paying 2,000 in currency to purchase a ring. When a player lands on an industry space with a ring, the owner of that industry must pay the active player. This represents the social responsibility of being the best in an industry.<br/><br/>To win the game, a player must have four rings on four different industries he owns. He also must land exactly on the Charity Shop space and pay 2,000 in currency.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a children's board game printed on the reverse side of a Ritz Bits cracker box. It was published as a promotional item by Nabisco.<br/><br/>The background of the board is montage of symbols and physical objects. The players must provide tokens and a coin. Movement is based on the flip of the coin... one move for heads, two moves for tails. Players move along a winding pathway (hence the &quot;wind&quot; in the title) and attempt to locate (the &quot;find&quot; in the title) items related to summer vacation. For example, a player could land on a space requiring the kid to locate four flip-flop sandals. Other spaces require a child to discover the subtle differences between two nearly identical images.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the end of the pathway is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

Recruits are bonafide action heroes, like we might see in the movies. Task Force H.A.T. agents are deployed against dictators, drug lords, and the like, when diplomacy and attempts to bring suspects in quietly have failed. Agents are authorized to neutralize the threat by any means necessary. If they manage to collar the perpetrator in their operations, so much the better. Task Force H.A.T. is meant to be played as if it were an action movie. The player characters are the stars of this movie, as such they are protected by the power of the plot. The plot has certain demands on its stars though and if they hope to get better and continue upping the ante on the evil forces of the world they will have to strive to earn Action points. Task Force H.A.T. is intended for 2-4 players.<br/><br/>Players earn Action Points by killing bad guys, making cheesy action movie puns and just doing cool stuff in general. Action Points are used to avoid attacks and activate certain special abilities that give players an advantage against their foes.<br/><br/>The heroes must complete a series of missions to level up their characters and equipment. The better they do on each mission, the faster they are able to upgrade their special abilities and equipment!<br/><br/>",

Players compete to build castles in the lands of the fair-folk whilst trying to defend them against the various inhabitants roaming the faerie realm.<br/><br/>Players collect cards that form the structure of their castles, which they may play down in front of themselves.  However when drawing new cards they may encounter the various creatures and peoples of the faerie realm who will try to attack and destroy the castles built there.  If defeated these attackers are imprisoned in the dungeons of the castles and add to  a players final score.  Should they be victorious the castle is destroyed and the players work begins again.<br/><br/>Artwork is presented in a black and white style to allow children to colour the cards themselves, individualizing their own copy<br/><br/>Faerie Castles is an entry in the 2015 Children's Game Print and Play Contest.<br/><br/>",

In addition to the standard Tiddledy Winks game, there is a board inset in the box set up like a dartboard with 10 segments and values ranging from 5 to 15.<br/><br/>The game Spot Tiddledy Winks requires snapping winks onto the board and totalling the scores (highest wins), while the Game of Forty-Five requires snapping five winks on a turn, with the player getting closest to 45 without going over winning.<br/><br/>There also are two bowling games included. One involves setting up ten wooden pins in a standard bowling triangle on the table, with three snaps per turn and resetting the pins after each player turn. Players score one point per pin downed, and highest total after 10 turns wins.<br/><br/>In the other bowling game, the pins are set up on the board in the 10 segments around the cup. The score per pin downed depends on the board segment.<br/><br/>",

Units that are cut off from headquarters ('the fortress') are disabled and destroyed.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player resigns or cannot pay off their debt at the beginning of a round - the remaining players are ranked based upon the size of their territory.<br/><br/>Similar to crayon-based games, Supply Line uses whiteboard markers to represent the network growth.<br/><br/>Each game starts with players concurrently developing their home area - this is quite fast, and takes about 30 minutes. Once basic networks have been developed, the game moves into turn-based rounds which concentrate on expansion, defence, and attack.<br/><br/>",

Only the planes are allowed to move over friendly playing pieces. Movement is permitted in all directions. Directions can be changed in mid-movement.<br/><br/>Enemy pieces are destroyed by moving onto spaces from where they can be hit by weapons fire. Firing range is the same as moving range. So an enemy plane is hit, if the attacker could reach the targets space in the next turn.<br/><br/>To win the game, a player has to move 3 of his pieces into the enemy base (Fliegerhorst) or destroy all enemy pieces.<br/><br/>The box cover shows a biplane with a swastika; but the use of biplanes suggest that there may be an earlier version, perhaps from World War I.

        "description": "The main title of the Naturvetarna series translates roughly to &quot;those who know about nature&quot;, each individual entry covering a Swedish biome. For instance, the Skogen (&quot;The Forest&quot;) box deals with species of plants, animals, mushrooms and lichen that can be found in various Swedish forests.<br/><br/>The game consists of a deck of 82 cards, with two cards to a species. One of these has an illustration on the front, the other a few sentences written in the first person listing characteristic traits or related facts; both have the name of the species on the back.<br/><br/>Several ways to use the cards are suggested, such as employing them in group exercises (e.g. sorting cards by categories or shared traits) or for a scoreless solo matching game. When played competitively, the rules suggest dividing an arbitrary number of participants (like a class of pupils) into two teams, potentially with a moderator (like a teacher) to read out clues from the text cards. The teams then try to collect pairs of cards either by identifying the species on a given picture card, gaining an additional point if they don't need any clues to do so, or by selecting the right picture card based on the clues from the corresponding text card.<br/><br/>In addition to Skogen, the series includes the entries Insj&ouml;n (The Lake), &Auml;ngen (The Meadow), Havet (The Sea), Fj&auml;llet (The Fell), and Staden (The City).<br/><br/>",

The game plays over the course of seven rounds. Each round, a simultaneous first phase allows the players to play cards from their hand on the action side or on the resource side, also discarding one of them onto the central (company)<br/><br/>The second phase is individual, and starts with the first player, who uses their actions and resources (if needed) to establish a camp on the mountain, to study the stones, or to construct ZeroG tools from them. Once your actions are spent, you can either recover one of the cards left by the players or leave them; you will be punished or rewarded based on your choice.<br/><br/>With its intertwined actions and grant system, Gravity Stones allows you to augment your base actions with the stones you get back from the central board. The company that's hired you will also give you objectives to fulfill...or not.<br/><br/>",

Combat can ensue, as the Villain to your left may block your attempted Caper.<br/><br/>Villains play Character &amp; Item cards with values that represent the number of dice they roll to solve that portion of the Caper; the Villain to your left rolls the number of dice on the Caper to &quot;set the point&quot; to match or beat.<br/><br/>Game length is adjustable depending on how many Capers players agree to play for at the beginning of the game, usually from 30-60 minutes. Solo play time is typically 20-30 minutes.<br/><br/>Each game comes with 54 high-quality, non-toxic cards made in the USA (8 Chessex dice - from the UK - included).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

So, when you and your cronies stumble across a parking lot full of luxury, heavily modified rally cars, there is no freaking way you can pass up such a tasty cherry just waiting to be plucked. But, to steal them all, and not end up doing a nickel in the big house, you know you must be... gone in 61 seconds.<br/><br/>How To Play<br/>Shuffle and arrange the &quot;Car&quot; and &quot;Security Guard&quot; cards in a 4x8 grid, face up on the playing surface. This is the &quot;Parking Lot.&quot; Security Guards face the most expensive car between those in front of and behind it. Place the rest of the deck face down. The player to the left of the dealer has first turn.<br/><br/>For each turn a player draws 1 card and replaces a card in the Parking Lot with it, keeping the card removed. &quot;Forward&quot; cards replace any unblocked card to steal it by driving it away in forward gear. &quot;Reverse&quot; cards allow the opposite action. &quot;Plus&quot; cards steal a car in either direction and give the player an extra turn. Blank cards cover Security Guards to remove them. If a card can't be played, place it at the bottom of the deck and skip the turn. A turn ends when the drawn card is played.<br/><br/>A car cannot be stolen if another car or Security Guard is blocking the path out of the lot, or if the guard's flashlight is pointed directly at it. The game ends when all cards have been stolen.<br/><br/>The player who has stolen the greatest value of cars after all have been boosted, wins!<br/><br/>",

The Kaiser is bringing the world to its knees. This is a war where anything is possible and anyone can become a legend. It is here where your journey begins.<br/><br/>Dark Legacy is a unique strategy game that mixes the best elements of campaign-style adventure games and tactical customizable card games and wraps them all up into an in-depth sci-fi/fantasy story. In Dark Legacy, players are no longer bystanders of the battle, they get to be part of it as a war general within one of six different factions. With the unique and various weapons, armor, and relics, that a player can equip themselves with, players can become whomever they imagine themselves to be.<br/><br/>In Dark Legacy, it is the players objective to destroy their opponents and their armies, by building a deck of magic spells that no one can withstand, rolling the d20 in their favor and strategically summoning their army to be the strongest. Just like in a real battle you will have to anticipate the probability of the unexpected. Don't make choices too hastily for they may be the demise of your army and yourself.<br/><br/>",
