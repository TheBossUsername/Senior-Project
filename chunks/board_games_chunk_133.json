        "description": "Scared to Death is a horror monster battle card game for 1 to 4 players. The goal of the game is to battle your way through an opponents monsters and steal all of their precious victims.  When a player has no victims left in play, they lose the game and their opponent is the winner!<br/><br/>Scared to Death uses the Ignats Card System; a battle card system designed by October Games that enables players to play with an infinite amount of cards in one match.  Players may choose to play a quick game by each using one, 28-card deck, or they may opt for a longer, more complex game, where each player uses five, 28 card decks!  Using multiple decks makes it possible to &ldquo;level up&rdquo; your monsters, making them stronger over the coarse of the game... yeah, you heard me: your cards can level up like characters in a video game.  Level 9 is currently the highest, although the system is designed in a way that makes it possible to release more expansions in the future; meaning your cards could level up infinitely!<br/><br/>The game was designed for 2 players, although variations for 1, 3 and 4 players have been added. Most games that claim you can play solo, end up being designed for 1 person, leaving players feeling as if they are playing a solo game alongside other players. This system uses a card driven AI, so when you are playing solo, you still feel that you are playing against another person. Of coarse the artificial intelligence is not as smart as a human brain, so the AI is given some special advantages to make it a worthy opponent. The four player variant is simply a 2 on 2 battle, that feels almost the same as a 2 player game, but you are partnered up with a teammate, with whom you can trade cards and devise strategies.<br/><br/>Further, Scared to Death can be played using only the cards, or with an add-on betting system that uses tokens, money, or even Halloween candy!   Overall, the Card System opens up a wide range of possibilities, including new, and entirely separate games that can be played using your existing Scared to Death cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the dystopian future of The Chronicles of Abakan: The Titan Campaigns, a new board game based on the visually stunning and evocative world imagined by the brilliant international sculptor and painter, Luca Zampriolo. Set in a resource-starved future, The Chronicles of Abakan centers around a world controlled by dynastic corporate families who rule through an apex of technology: HDMs (Hard Doll Machines), powerful mechas that serve as both industrial laborers and military enforcers.<br/> The most powerful of these families is House Weingart, a tyrannical and fascist regime whose monopoly over advanced HDM technologies and, most importantly, the super-efficient refined fuel known as &ldquo;Wein,&rdquo; has granted them a long-standing and unchallenged authority&hellip;<br/> &hellip;until now.<br/> Deep in the solar system, where Wein is fueled on distant planets, the colony of Terra Nova has rebelled. Hailing mostly from North America, the Neo-Terrans have summoned the revolutionary spirit of their ancestors and successfully repulsed their Weingart overlords, and now an interplanetary Civil War has begun.<br/> The Chronicles of Abakan is a world of mercenaries and warlords, of bounty hunters and generals, and revolutionaries and military soldiers. Where HDMs drop from transport ships high in orbit around distant planets to do battle on strange and alien terrains, from the crumbling streets of New York City to the frozen tundras of Saturn&rsquo;s moon Titan, and beyond.<br/><br/>So join in on the strategic and tactical boardgame pitting players against one another in an attempt to secure their dominion or their freedom in a merciless civil war set in humanity&rsquo;s grim future. The Titan Campaigns chronicle the early years of the Neo-Terrans&rsquo; revolution, where players battle for control of resource giving holdings in the Novan Sector, near Saturn. Moons, asteroids, and space stations serve as the battlegrounds, and players maneuver against each other by moving their fleets around the Campaign Map, building up shipyards, factories, and refineries and balancing their resources with expansion and military might.<br/> When battle is engaged, players move to tile-based battlegrounds, pitting their HDMs (Hard Doll Machines)&ndash;giant weaponized mechs&ndash;against one another. These miniatures are based on Luca Zampriolo&rsquo;s original designs, and the models themselves are sculpted by Luca Zampriolo himself, as well as Filippo Zanicotti of Dust Tactics fame. When a player conquers his opponent&rsquo;s holding, he adds it to his own, thus increasing his 4 Resources: Labor, Oil, Iron, and Wein until only one player is left standing.<br/> The board game is set to have two factions: The oppressive Weingart Dynasty and the Neo-Terrans--choose your side today!<br/><br/><br/>",

He meets new friends and is given lots of gifts in different sizes, weights and shapes. He wants to bring them home before caterpillar Rosi has eaten all the lettuce.<br/><br/>Aim of the game: The players cooperate in trying to get Max and his presents home before it is too late.<br/><br/>Setup: The six round cards - five showing one of Max' animal friends and one showing the garden in which Rosi lives - are placed in a circle. The six lettuce chips are placed on the garden card. The colourful gifts (mostly wooden objects but also a pillow and a blanket) are placed in the center and Max' journey starts. He is placed outside the circle of cards, next to the garden card.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Players take turns rolling the die. If a colour is rolled, Max (a wooden plate with stalk eyes and a semi-circle shaped house) is moved with a wooden pushing rod along the circle of cards to the animal of that color. Then a gift of the same colour is loaded onto Max. If the next player rolls the same colour, he/she must push Max one full circle. If there is no gift left in that colour, the die is re-rolled. If a star is rolled, the player may choose any colour and doesn't have to move Max.<br/>If Max loses a gift (i.e. it falls down while Max is being pushed), one lettuce chip is turned over and the gifts are put back on Max.<br/><br/>As soon as gifts in all five colours have been loaded onto Max, the active player returns him to the garden. If there is at least one head of lettuce left, the players win the game.<br/><br/>",

The Moorhuhn chips are the same size but show the chicken. All the chips are put into the sock, from which the players draw them, trying to collect as many victory points as possible.<br/>Players take turns drawing a chip from the sock. If it is a number chip, the player chooses if he/she wants to continue or keep all the chips he/she has drawn this round. The active player continues drawing chips until he/she either decides to stop, or he/she draws a Moorhuhn chip.<br/>When a player decides to stop, he/she gets to keep the chips drawn this round, sorts them into colours and puts them into rows so that the other players can see them. Black is a joker and the player has to decide which colour he/she wants to use the black chip for at the end of the round.<br/>If a Moorhuhn is drawn, the player's turn ends and he/she doesn't get any chips that round - they go to the next player instead.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last Moorhuhn turns up. Each player counts the point in their row with the smallest number of chips. The player with the most points in that row wins the game.<br/><br/>In a variant players get to keep the chips if a Moorhuhn turns up, but they have to give their row of chips of the same colour as the Moorhuhn to the next player. Scoring is also different: The player with the highest number of points in any of their rows wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The gods now vie to become the chief deity of these islanders through enacting various miracles to fulfill the community&rsquo;s needs, to inspire the creation of shrines, and to shape the very earth to advance their own divine message and thwart the blasphemies of the other gods.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of these gods. The game centers around manipulating the mortals by performing miracles such as the creation of manna, idols, and auras, transforming the landscape, and acquiring the power such miracles require. After each player has performed miracles for the turn, some of the mortals act, randomly selecting from the options of exploring, praying, or enshrining idols.<br/><br/>Players earn victory points through the mortals' prayer, the enshrining and worship of their idols, and through providing the manna for the island's feasts.

Map, Man, Woman, Child. These are called the Titles. A random card is selected and that suit are trumps, here called Stars.<br/><br/>It is for four players divided into two teams and is essentially Whist. Players must follow suit, can trump, etc. Every trick above 6 scores a point. There are also bonus points for Titles. After the deal before play begins, should your side have all the four Titles in the Stars suit, your team scores four extra points. If three of them you score 3 points. Two each per team scores nothing extra.<br/><br/>The game also includes rules for playing The Game of Monkey. Any number can play. Take out one card at random. The value of that card means that only three others are in play. Deal out all the cards that are left. In turn a player may discard any pair in his hand on to the table, calling out, say, &quot;A pair of Maps&quot; or &quot;A pair of sixes&quot; and so on. Then the next player throws out a pair. If a player does not have a pair, he draws a card from the hand of the player on his right. Eventually, using this mechanic, all the cards will be matched as pairs except for the Monkey, the card drawn at random at the start.<br/><br/>The player holding the Monkey at the end - quote &quot;rejoices in the pleasure of being called the 'Monkey'. Curiously, it doesn't say if the 'Monkey' wins the game or loses it. If it is a 'pleasure' I suppose he wins.<br/><br/>",

Game play can be easily tailored to age/skill level with 3 levels of difficulty (Junior, Senior 5, Senior 7) and an adjustable time limit.<br/><br/>The goal is to problem solve and work either alone or with a partner to strategically gain the optimum score of seven points in each round. In the Junior Game, this score is attained through using a hand of five cards and using addition of 1, 2 or 3 cards to reach a total of 7, 17, or 27. There are other goals which require strategic management of cards in order to achieve extra points per turn.<br/><br/>&quot;This game isn't just for people who score the highest marks for Mathematics in a school examination, it's for everyone! Those who can analyse the cards in their hands and add up quickly and accurately will be the winner, and those who struggle will learn and improve very quickly.&quot;<br/><br/>",

If a tower topples over, the dice are put into the pool for the next roll.<br/><br/>The game ends when all dice have been stacked. The player with the highest tower wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Did you know that he was crossing the Falls and at halfway he stopped and cooked and ate an omelette?<br/><br/>The game is to be played with dice. Throw the dice, each player in turn, until one of the dice is a 1, at which time place a button on No. 1 space, and throw again for a 2. Should neither of the dice be a 2 or the sum of the two dice when added be 2, move down one space, and the next takes a turn. Always endeavor to throw the next number to the one you are on, and move down one space for each throw that you miss. When the party throwing is below the top numbers, and succeeds in throwing the number thrown for, he places his button on the number near the rope. When any doublets are thrown, it is a move to the top and next number. Continue on until you gain No. 12.<br/><br/>",

One team gets the four daughters of the Moser family, the other team the four sons of the Huber family. Each team gets 4 boy/girl tokens, 9 toy tokens, 1 player board (the team with the girls gets the boy board and vice versa). 3 of the 9 player tokens are given to the other team.

They put one of the boy tokens and a toy token inside the cablecar. The cablecar is attached to the rope and sent over to the other team. The team checks with the help of the player board if the boy and toy match (i.e. if it is the green boy token, the toy has to be the one that was assigned to the green boy on the board).

        "description": "Out-golf up to 71 simultaneous opponents in this riveting game of strategy and luck. Choose between 9 and 18 holes to make the game longer or shorter (about 1-2 hours of play time). Each of the 18 holes is represented by a unique, hand-drawn map of the area, which is divided into small segments to help players gauge the approximate distance from the tee-off point to the green. Players use different colors of golf ball pawns to track their progress across each map. Just as with actual golf, players will attempt to complete the game in the fewest number of &quot;strokes&quot; possible. For each stroke, a player will first decide whether or not they wish to spin for a &quot;distance bonus&quot;--a free number of segments they are allowed to move their pawn toward the hole. This can be advantageous, but a bad spin also has the potential to land the player in a dangerous sand trap or water hazard (both of which carry a stroke penalty), so the decision should not be made lightly. After resolving or skipping this spin, the player then decides how many dice to throw, from 1 to 3, attempting to land as close to the green as possible. Each pip on the dice represents the player's ball moving forward 1 segment; therefore, if too many or too few dice are thrown, players can easily fall short of, or overshoot, their goal. Once a player lands on the green, they attempt to putt their way into the hole, which involves slightly different dice-rolling mechanics.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is also given a number of Skill Cards which can be spent in various ways:<br/>1. A Skill Card can be discarded before a roll to add an extra die. This is helpful for players who wish to have a longer drive, thereby increasing their chances of avoiding a large number of hazards or traps near the center of a map.<br/>2. If a player does land in a hazard or trap, he or she may discard a Skill Card to ignore the stroke penalty of that hazard or trap.<br/>3. A Skill Card may be used to change one die result on a player's putting roll, thereby refining the putting accuracy.<br/>4. Finally, any unspent Skill Cards can be used at the end of the game to subtract a stroke from one's own score, or to add a stroke to an opponent's score.<br/><br/>Also includes a solo variant in which the player attempts to finish all 18 holes in under 72 strokes. This goal is then adjusted according to the player's level of success.<br/><br/>",

Stave off menacing alien threats!<br/><br/>Gestalt is a worker placement game, where players (cooperatively or competitively) assign workers to tasks to build Gestalt Mechs.  Each piece of the mech provides a number of resources or attributes.  Once a mech is ready, you assign those mechs to face an incoming threat.  The resources provided by the components is spent, or lost, and some parts will need to be replaced before the next battle. Undefeated threats can destroy parts of the board, cutting you off from valuable resources, so build quickly!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game for two to five players. There are 36 cards  in the pack. The object of the game is to get rid of all your cards by playing one at a time. When play has been completed, the cards held in the players&rsquo; hands count against them. The lowest score wins.<br/><br/>Select a dealer. Shuffle the cards and deal five, one at a time, face downwards to each player. If there are two players, deal seven at a time. Place the remaining cards face down on the table in front of the players. Turn the top card face up, next to the pile. This is the card on to which other cards will be played. If this card is a Superman card, replace it in the middle of the pile and turn over another.<br/><br/>The person on the dealer's left commences by playing face up on the up turned card, one that matches it. He may play either one of the same number or of the same background colour. For instance, if the first card is a number three Super Boy, yellow, he may play any yellow card or any number three card regardless of colour. All Superman cards ere wild and can be played when a player wishes. After playing a Superman card, the player may play next whatever card he wishes. Play continues in a clockwise fashion.<br/><br/>A player who cannot make a match or play a Superman card. must draw from the pile and does not play that turn. When the centre pile is exhausted, a player passes if he cannot play.<br/><br/>The game is over when either one of the players is out of cards or when nobody can play. Players then total their points, counting each card at face value except the Superman cards which count 25. The game may be continued for a series of runs until one player reaches an agreed number of points, say 100. The lowest scorer then wins.<br/><br/>",

Starting with the player left of the dealer, a player turns over the top card in his pile and puts it the centre of the table. Thus, the game progresses. Shouls one of the four Hunny cards be revealed, all the players must race to be the first to touch the card. The fastest player gets all the cards in the centre of the table which go face-down on the bottom of his stack. It is suggested that if at all possible, a referee should be on hand to settle disputes over who was the quickest. If you run out of cards you may still join in the race for the next Hunny card but should you be not the quickest, you are out of the game. In effect, you get a second chance to stay in the game.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who collects all the cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Introduction<br/><br/>Fall of Eagles is to some extent a companion to our Imperial Wars sets, which enable players to recreate colonial actions in the nineteenth century. Fall of Eagles shifts the scene from Queen Victoria's little wars to the major conflicts in Europe itself. The rules are designed to allow wargamers to taste the flavour of formal warfare in the nineteenth century.  It is a period which saw great changes in both the political make-up of Europe and the technology of warfare.<br/><br/>The designer has defined both the ground scale (and consequently, the figure basing parameters):<br/><br/>Figure Scale: 1 figure = 50 men (infantry and cavalry)<br/>Ground Scale: 1cm = 20 yds<br/><br/>The rules include army lists for the period's major powers, as well as a points system to allow for ahistorical battles to be fought between roughly equivalent forces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A children's game focusing on the clock.<br/><br/>The little cuckoo that comes out of the clock to announce the hours is very busy. Can you help him to organise his activities so that he can call out the hours on time?<br/><br/>Setup: The 12 clock counters (one for each hour) are turned face down and shuffled. Players take turns turning them face up and placing them on the board in clockwise order. The clock hand is placed in the center of the board. The wooden cuckoo is placed on the red twelve. The 24 cards are distributed evenly among the players. They show what the cuckoo is doing (watching TV, going for a hike etc.) and how long it takes him (1-4 hours).<br/><br/>Game play: The starting player spins the clock's hand. The hand shows the time at which the cuckoo has to be back to call out the hour. Then the active player puts a card next to the board and moves the cuckoo 1-4 spaces, depending on the duration that the card states. If the cuckoo lands on a space before the time indicated by the clock's hand, the cuckoo is too early. He's got time for another activity and it is the next player's turn now. If the cuckoo lands on space indicated by the clock's hand, he is just on time. As a reward, the player may place another card of his/her choice on the stack next to the board. If the cuckoo lands after the time indicated by the hand, it means he is late. As a penalty, the player has to take back his/her card and draws an additional card from the pile.<br/><br/>The player who manages to get rid of his/her cards first wins the game.<br/><br/>A second variant listed in the instructions consists of players taking turns telling what the cuckoo is doing when. e.g. player 1 says &quot;At seven o'clock the cuckoo gets out of bed.&quot; Then the clock's hand is advanced one hour and the next player says what the cuckoo is doing at eight o'clock. (This is a speaking activity rather than a game; there is no winning condition.)<br/><br/>",

The orange side usually shows two animal heads (sometimes more), the purple side always six animal heads.<br/><br/>The first game is a simple picture dominoes variant. Players put their cards next to one with a matching animal head.<br/><br/>The main game, &quot;Schnabel und Schnauze&quot; is played using the purple side of the cards. Each player draws three cards. A starting card is placed and then players take turns. On your turn, you can either draw a card (hand limit is 4), add a card (cards are all placed in longitudinal direction) next to another so that a row of identical animal heads results, or put a card ON another without completely covering it. Players earn points for making rows of the same animal longer. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>The third variant is &quot;Zoo-M&quot;, in which the purple side of the cards is used in a puzzle of 3x4, 4x5 or 6x6 cards. At the edges, the animals have to match.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- 36 cards, printed on both sides<br/>- 2 cards that contain the instructions<br/><br/>",

Players try to keep their identities secret, which leads to everyone becoming suspicious of being a fanatic. The population can only be kept safe if the fanatics can be found out and evicted from the city as soon as possible.<br/><br/>The game is played in alternating rounds of night (when the fanatics decide on a victim to murder) and day (when court hearings and evictions take place). Each fraction (Israelites and Romans versus fanatics) tries to eliminate the other. Once all the night activities have taken place, the player whose character has been killed that night is eliminated from the game. The remaining players decide on a player they want to evict from the city. That player is eliminated from the game as well. The game is played until only one fraction is left, which then wins the game.<br/><br/>The game contains 32 cards. Among the role cards are characters from the Bible with special skills: Jesus can convert a fanatic if he identifies him/her correctly. Maria can protect a person against the fanatics. The necromancer can bring back a dead character by taking over his/her identity.<br/><br/>",

Movement is by a die. Nearly every space on the pole has instructions, sometimes good, sometimes bad. You must obey the instructions, of course.<br/><br/>When a player reaches the top (by exact throw of course, in games of this vintage), wins the round. Everyone starts at the bottom and play again proceeds as above. The first player to win ten rounds, wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Introduction<br/><br/>Savage Wars of Peace is a set of rules for gaming the colonial wars of the Victorian Era. This rules set provides a quick playing yet historically accurate simulation for this exciting period. These rules are primarily intended to recreate the major battles at the height of the Colonial period, 1878-1901.<br/><br/>This is not a set of skirmish rules. Units are battalions or their native equivalents. After becoming familiar with the rules, players should be able to recreate some of the great battles of colonial campaigns such as Ulundi, Abu Klea, Kandahar and the relief of Peking. With a little experience, each player should be able to comfortably handle a brigade sized unit of 3,000 scale men.<br/><br/>The rules are primarily intended for use with 15mm scale military miniatures. 20mm and 25mm figures use a slightly different figure scale and mounting arrangement, but the time and ground scales remain the same (1 turn = 5 minutes, and 1&quot; = 20 yds). The game uses both average dice and 20 sided (percentile) dice to resolve morale and combat situations.<br/><br/>The expanded edition includes information and data to play the campaigns in the following colonial wars:<br/><br/><br/>    Indian Mutiny<br/>    Second Afghan War<br/>    Zulu War<br/>    Egyptian Rebellion<br/>    French conquest of Tonkin<br/>    Mahdist Uprising<br/>    French campaign in Dahomey<br/>    Reconquest of the Sudan<br/>    Great Pathan Revolt<br/>    Boer Wars<br/>    Boxer Rebellion<br/>    French conquest of Morocco<br/><br/><br/>",

It comes in a tin box and uses magnetic player pieces.<br/><br/>The board (printed inside the tin box) shows a racing track consisting of 30 spaces. 8 of them are special spaces (showing the numbers +1, -1, +2, +3 or a T-rex head). One space is both the starting and finish space. At the side of the box, there is a strength indicator for each dinosaur. It is set to 1 at the start of the game and adjusted when that player's dinosaur token lands on one of the special fields with numbers.<br/>Players take turns rolling a standard six-sided number die. The active player moves his/her dinosaur token the number of spaces corresponding to the die roll. If the token lands on a special field with a number, that player's dinosaur gains or loses strength accordingly. If a player lands on one of the two battle spaces (= spaces with the T-rex head symbol), he/she can challenge another player that is ahead of him/her. Both players roll the die and add their dino's current strength to the result. If the challenging dino wins the battle (die roll plus strength &gt; that of the defending dino), the two tokens swap places. The challenger is now ahead.<br/><br/>The player whose dino reaches the finish space first wins the game.<br/><br/>",

A new chapter card is drawn and resolved at the start of each new round.<br/><br/>There are four different types of Verse cards. <br/>Acts of God: Cards that negatively affect the other players <br/>Miracles: Cards that affect you in a positive way <br/>Disbelief: Cards that cancel or in other ways affect Miracle or Faith cards<br/>Faith: Cards that cancel or in other ways affect Acts of God or Disbelief cards<br/><br/>At the end of the game the Prophet with the most followers wins the game, and the rest of you get a ticket to that hot fiery place downstairs. However, should two or more prophets be tied to win, they are all annihilated in a furious Holy War and the next prophet in line wins the game.

        "description": "Sink the Biz (originally &quot;Sink the Bismark&quot;) is a dexterity game traditionally played at Nick's English Hut in Bloomington, IN.<br/><br/>The game is played using a metal bucket filled with beer, with a small weighted juice glass (the &quot;Biz&quot;) floating in it. The bucket is placed in the middle of the table, within easy reach of all players. Each player has a glass filled with the same type beer that is in the bucket. Players take turns pouring small amounts of their beer inside the floating glass. Usually players agree on a minimum height from which the beer must be poured into the Biz. Also, it is generally acknowledged that just a drop or two of beer are not enough to satisfy one's turn requirement. In case of any ambiguity in this sense, all the other players vote to decide whether or not a pour was enough. If it is decided that the active player did not pour the minimum amount, the active player must pour again before his turn is over.<br/><br/>The player who sinks the Biz must recover it from the bucket and drink all of its content. After that, the Biz is placed back in the bucket, players' glasses are refilled, and the process is repeated. Players may drop out of the game at any time. The game is over when only one player remains in the game. That player is the winner.<br/><br/>The game allows for limited strategic decisions. The main strategy is to fill the Biz as much as possible during one's turn, to make it more likely for the next player to sink the Biz. This is, however, a calculated risk, as the player attempting this technique may end up pouring too much beer and sinking the Biz as a result.<br/><br/>",

Players can (and should!) ask each other to elaborate on the answers, especially if the answers are too short! Players can skip a turn but by doing so they miss a chance to win a gemstone.

There are 45 cards in total, and the sets are numbered 1 to 4. There is also a Freddy the Fox card which should be given to another player during play (if you get the chance). The collecting of sets is traditional: Ask for a card from a set that you already have one card in. If the player askled has one, he hands it over. If he doesn't then he can call &quot;Exchange&quot; and the asker and asked choose one card to give to the other (face-down of course). This is the only way to get rid of useless cards from your point of view and, of course, to get rid of Freddy if you happen to hold it.<br/><br/>There are 12 other cards called Trophy cards. They have a fold in the centre and can be stood up like an arch (a very nice touch). When you lay down a completed set, you take the trophy card that relates to it. The Trophy cards all have a points value, some sets worth more than others.<br/><br/>When all the sets have been found, each player adds up their Trophy card scores, but getting -50 to the holder of Freddy the Fox at the end. The first player to score 250 or more, wins. This may take several games to achieve.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>The North American Upgrade Set is an expansion set for The War to End All Wars and stand alone game. The North American Upgrade Set provides four primary game scenarios. The first two of these are attachment scenarios to allow this expanded map to be used with The War to End All Wars and the rest of the WW1 series. The first is simply new unit placements and expanded rules for the American entry into WWI. It provides expanded play options for the USA, Canada, and Mexico. The second is a scenario where the US is certain to enter on the Central Powers' side, and British, Canadian, Mexican, Japanese, and possibly even French forces must move to defeat or at least contain America and win the war in Europe before American war industries gear up to break to deadlock in the war. Additionally the game provides two stand alone scenarios. These are the War of 1812, and the American-Mexican War. The map provides resource differences for the three time periods, and therule book includes different set ups, political rules, and scenario guidelines for each war.<br/><br/>",

The two centre squares of the opposite long sides are coloured white and the rest of the squares are each coloured one of six other colours.<br/> Each player starts with 26 pieces, one king, two queens, two rooks  four bishops, four knights and thirteen pawns. All except the king have a colour matching one or other of the board square colours and pieces start on the same rank as their king on their matching board square colour, pawns doing likewise on the second rank.<br/> Pieces mostly move as in chess but the king can move up to three squares, the object being to be first to get your king onto the opposing player's king's starting square.<br/> Pawns can be promoted to any piece that has been captured so that loss of your king is not necessarily fatal.<br/><br/>",

Duel is designed for recreating World War I air combat using Tumbling Dice's 1/600th scale aircraft models.<br/><br/>The games are designed to last around one or two hours. As the sky tends to be a lot less cluttered than the ground, games can be set up quickly and fewer models are required - making for a cheaper night out.<br/><br/>Any number of people can play. As the victory target is dependant on the size of a force, opposing sides don't have to be equally balanced, a smaller or less sophisticated mix of planes can defeat a larger or more advanced enemy by reaching their (lower) victory target first.<br/><br/>Each model represents and individual aircraft or balloon. Elevation is abstracted using 4 levels, and the game uses D6 and D3 (a d6 numbered 1,1,2,2,3,3) for combat resolution.<br/><br/>",

Try to become a virtual millionaire by buying property, shares &amp; other assets and learn about investment. Players have jobs; buy businesses and property; have mortgages, bank loans and credit cards and take out insurance. Opportunities allow a player to improve their assets and increase their income. Life Events affect an individual player and may be good or bad for their asset position. Market Events affect all players and could be good or bad. Luxuries cost the player money and don't earn any income. The length of the game is determined by the players but is typically around 90 minutes. The winner is the player with the most net assets at the end. <br/> Net worth is calculated as the sum of all cash and investments (shares, property, bank deposits, speculations etc. including half the value of any luxuries) less any borrowings from the bank (mortgages, bank loans and credit cards).<br/><br/>",

When a new card is selected, another player is dealt a card through a &quot;Gifting&quot; process. Thus, players must choose wisely when they select a card because they may be giving others a good card, too.<br/><br/>Midway through the game, players score for the humans in their neighborhood &ndash; counting themselves and dividing that number into The Human Alliance (people who reject the alien's attack) and the Neoxenophiliacs (those who embrace the extraterrestrials) &ndash; while also scoring for having the fewest aliens and zombies in their little fiefdoms. Scoring happens again at the end of the game, with the winning player gaining the prestigious role of Governor of Fornia. (Okay, it's not that prestigious.)<br/><br/>Zomboozle is notable for being the first game with the &quot;Gifting Mechanism&quot;. When you draft a card, someone else gets a card as a result. The location of the card on a tableau or the information on the card might govern how the distribution occurs. This mechanism is in two other proposed games from 3Sided Card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Theme Park, players take on the role of theme park managers that all work for the Earl Synergy Company, an entertainment giant that has spent the last 75 years making movies, television and theme parks for families around the world. Players get to run their own regional Synergyland theme park. Over the course of four years, each player makes the best use of his management team and resources to maximize his own Synergyland's performance by building out his parks; ensuring the right mix of attractions, shops and shows to draw tourists to his park; taking advantage of marketing opportunities to promote his own parks, both building overall attendance and his own block of it; and developing out his roster of executive staff. The player with the most victory points (including special &quot;Brownie Points&quot; for being a &quot;company man&quot;) at the end of four years becomes the new CEO of the Earl Synergy Company and wins the game.<br/><br/>Each turn in Synergyland, players place their differently skilled executive pieces on the various company spaces to claim resources, attractions, shows, marketing opportunities and other items that will help build out their park so they can grab the highest attendance and revenue when the tourists are distributed throughout the year. Each year, different factors will affect the company as a whole, new marketing campaigns and brands will be developed that executives may or may not want to harness to drive the masses to their parks. But the trick to getting more value out of your company executives is that the more they collaborate, the better the synergy. When more than one executive is placed on a specific location, they generate more of an advantage, a more valuable park addition or a greater marketing campaign or they just make the item cheaper in the long run &ndash; although there are certainly some times when too much help means too many ideas...so be careful to get into that &quot;sweet spot&quot; for collaboration.<br/><br/>",

Stand-up cardboard models of enemy ships are set up on a large triangular board decorated with ocean graphics. The sub commander looks through the mirrored periscope device (viewing down, not up, of course!) to target the enemy ships. The device contains two torpedo launchers with spring-loaded triggers. The torpedo looks like a plastic dart from a vintage dart pistol, but without the rubber tip. When the sub commander has the enemy in sight, he pulls the trigger and launches the torpedo.

The goal of the game is to be the last player to possess a capital. Different regions have different allotments of troops/money, thus changing a player's strategy from game to game. Battling is dice-based, with tactics cards being used to modify the battles. As virions are developed they become more powerful, becoming game-changers. Players must develop a hospital infrastructure to allow them to deploy their troops and save them from enemy attacks.<br/><br/>",

Equally challenging for kids and adults.  Categories available for kids and families.<br/><br/>Once players fill the game board with letters, one person will draw a card with a list of categories.

To level the playing field, each letter has a different color on the back &mdash; players can agree to only award points to certain color pieces, adding an element of chance to the outcome.<br/><br/>Contents: Game board, 50 letter tokens, 50 cards (250 categories), scoring pad and pencil<br/><br/>",

At these scales magic is real, fantastical beasts roam, and good and evil vie for supremacy. At the heart of Nemyne is Archon Arena. Here the lords of the land, the Archons, wage ruthless battles night and day. Combatants with equal resources call forth the power of melee and magic: weapons, armor, maneuvers, spells and potions, all under the watchful eye of the battle leader. They have only one goal, to eliminate the opponent. Winning means prestige and acclaim; and being the target of countless challengers.<br/><br/>A duel in Archon Arena consists of three battles. The two players each begin with equal decks that are randomly divided into three piles, one for each upcoming battle. For a given battle each player chooses a surprise reserve card and a leader who grants a special ability. Then a round consists of playing cards simultaneously, comparing offense and defense, and tallying damage. The battle is complete when one or both players lose all their hit points, and the overall winner is the player who wins more of the three battles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We're proud to bring &quot;Welcome to Wall Street&quot; to the public for the first time. We have worked for years making this the most exciting game of investing ever! A player buys stock and commodities through and tries to build up his/her portfolio while trying to bankrupt other investors. An investor can also force opponents to sell them their shares through &quot;Hostile Takeovers&quot;. Investors have opportunities to purchase IPOs, force others to share their profits when they get Mutual Funds, and investors will also face having their transportation repossessed and get stuck driving a &quot;beater&quot; if bad investments are made. When an investor goes bankrupt, the investor with the most cash assets is declared the &quot;King&quot; or &quot;Queen&quot; of the bulls. There's some back stabbing and luck involved. It's a &quot;Dog eat Dog&quot; world out there. This is one place you can lose it all and still walk away laughing. &quot;Welcome to Wall Street&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A turn based tactics strategy game pitting two armies against each other for total dominating victory. The last one standing is the victor. Armies consist of units that range from a wide range of factions, including circus performers, fairies and the undead.<br/><br/>The game begins with an always changing battlefield and a win/lose condition being selected, such as last one standing or capture the flag. Players then take their fully customized armies and deploy their units one at a time, alternating players between each unit to ensure both offensive and defensive lineups. When the deploy is completed, players alternate activating each of their units, moving and attacking, to try to reach the win condition.<br/><br/>Each unit has their own critical stats, such as Attack value, Defensive value, movement value, attack grids and inherent powers. To stop overpowered armies, associated costs are also attached to each unit to put a cap on army limits. Strategy doesn't lie in the most powerful units, it lies in picking the right units for your army and how to position them best counter your opponent's strategies.<br/><br/>Ultimately, he idea behind Rumble Tactics is a tactics strategy game that is affordable, portable, and customizable.<br/><br/>AFFORDABILITY: the game in its core is and will always be free to play by making it &quot;print and play&quot;. If fancier cards and tokens are requested, for example, DIY solutions are available.<br/><br/>PORTABLE: The Unit Tokens are 1&quot; in size and a standard battlefield is no larger than a piece of 8.5 x 11 paper. With the addition of a handful of Unit Cards and d6, you've got a game that you can take anywhere and play at even the smallest of restaurant tables.<br/><br/>CUSTOMIZABLE: Through both the BGG site and Rumble Tactics site, all of the rules, cards, and tokens will be available in many graphic formats so players can create their own units. Want an army full of cows that shoot lasers? Why not. As long as you and your friends/opponents agree on the units, the possibilities are endless.  There's even a handy spreadsheet to input values (attack, defense, etc.) that will calculate the COST of each unit, making it as fair as possible.<br/><br/>Come join the fun and fill the ranks of Rumble Tactics!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Emden vs. Sydney is a tactical naval wargame for two players, based on a modified version of the classic rules first developed by Fletcher Pratt in the 1930s. The game simulates the Battle of Cocos that took place on November 9, 1914, between the German cruiser Emden and the Australian cruiser Sydney in the South Indian Ocean.<br/><br/>Emden vs. Sydney is a simple, all-skill game in which players maneuver their ship on the floor and fire at the enemy to inflict damage. The Emden&mdash;a raider that had captured or sank over 100,000 tons of shipping since the outbreak of hostilities&mdash;met its end in the actual battle at the hands of the Sydney, a light cruiser with larger guns and superior range. The game is one of skill, as players not only use strategy in moving their ship, but also must direct and estimate the range of their gunfire towards the enemy. Good tactics&mdash;and a good eye for directing fire&mdash;can spell the difference between victory and defeat.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Qero is played on a rectangular 5 times 5 board. As with most old games the exact rules passed on over time are not exactly clear. Variants described here are usually taken from Internet or book sources mentioned or as found, played and explained by word of mouth on mediaeval LARP conventions. The game is assumed to be derived from or match the family of Alquerque.<br/><br/>Mentioned web sites or references claim Qero to be an ancient mediaeval game of unknown source. Thus on the one hand unfortunately no game author can be listed and on the other hand it should not have any legal restrictions, trademarks, patents, or utility patterns in place. The game is in the public domain.<br/><br/>Mostly Qero is played without any specific line patterns shown on board (in contrast to Alquerque). If a line pattern is shown on the board players may agree on performing moves on each direction of lines shown by the pattern only. Thus moves are allowed along the lines only. Otherwise rules might allow horizontal and vertical moves only. By agreement diagonal moves in any direction could be performed as well. Although the later seems to be quite uncommon.<br/><br/>Variant 1: Started on an empty board the players set up all their pieces first. Players' pieces are facing up their own symbol or color. The pieces are placed onto the remaining free positions of the board in alternating game play. Thus if no player achieved a winning situation during this board set up phase then the first player ends up with 13 gaming pieces set and the second player set 12 gaming pieces of own color.<br/><br/>Up to that point it is a typical 5-in-a-row variant like tic-tac-toe, Renju, Pente, or Go-Moku without any kind of capturing. After this set up phase game play changes although the goal is still to build a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of five of your pieces. After set up phase take a piece of your color off the chosen edge position and place it back on the board shifting the other pieces filling up the newly formed gap (from the end of an incomplete row or column of your choice). Like in Quixo... Probably just gut feeling: There seem to be less draw situations in direct comparison to Quixo (assumed experienced players really try to achieve winning the game).<br/><br/>In this Qero variant the amount of pieces on board controlled by the player is fixed after the initial set up phase. So you could simply use some two sided game pieces (Othello/Reversi) or even simple pawns (e.g. 13 white plus 12 black pawns w/ white starting the game) and start playing on any 5 times 5 board as well.<br/><br/>Variant 2: Started on an empty board the players set up all their pieces first. Players' pieces are facing up their own symbol or color. The pieces are placed onto the remaining free positions of the board in alternating game play. Each player sets up 12 pieces of own color if no player achieved a winning situation during this board set up phase. One board position remains empty.<br/><br/>Up to that point it is a typical 5-in-a-row variant, too. There is no kind of capturing opponent's gaming pieces. After this set up phase game play changes although the goal is still to build a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of five of your own pieces. The game continues and a player's turn consists in chosing any type of gaming piece may it be own or opponent's from the edge positioned in direct straight line towards the board position left empty. From the chosen board position push all pieces in between in straight line so the chosen position is the new empty position.<br/><br/>Variant 3: At start of game on all but one board position a die is placed with none symbol facing or a symbol indicating a neutral field not owned by any player. The dice has to show various faces (one with a number or symbol for the first player, another for the second player and finally one for indicating neutral positions). Compared to previous variants there is no set up phase.<br/><br/>A player's turn consists in selecting a die showing an empty or own symbol from the edge. If this die is showing an empty face it turns to show the face with the player's symbol now. The selected die has to be positioned in direct straight line towards the board position left empty. Otherwise it can not be selected. From the chosen board position push all pieces in between in straight line so the chosen position is the new empty position. Again the goal is still to build a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of five of your own pieces.<br/><br/>Obviously a fourth variant could be introduced similiar to the one before allowing to chose any (not just own or empty) die from the edge instead.<br/><br/>Variant 2 is most-likely targeted and described in German in &quot;Allerley Spielerey - Spielen wie im Mittelalter&quot;, Gisela Muhr and Eleonore Sieck, ISBN 978-3-939722-38-0, p.118, 2011, published by Regionalia. The book includes only an abstract description how the authors interprete to push a chosen stone from the edge (is it allowed to use own color only or could the opponent's color be chosen as well?) to the empty position exactly.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pop 'n' Spawn is a 2-player abstract strategy board game where players attempt to occupy territory with mushrooms. Once placed on the board, mushrooms have the capacity to spawn endless copies of themselves in different directions. Players struggle for supremacy by growing, defending and capturing mushrooms.<br/><br/>Players take alternating turns to play. On each turn a player places one mushroom of his colour on an empty square on the board. Before placing the mushroom, the player chooses the direction of the mushroom to be up, down, left or right; the direction is indicated by an arrow on the mushroom. After playing the mushroom the player's turn ends and his mushroom(s) will now spawn: each of his mushrooms on the board will make a duplicate of itself in the direction of the arrow on the mushroom.<br/><br/>Mushrooms that spawn towards each other will combine their directions allowing them to make copies of themselves in multiple directions. If a player's mushroom spawns towards his opponent's mushroom, it will attack and capture it, changing the colour to its own. However a capture can be prevented if the defending mushroom has a direction opposed to the attacking mushroom. After spawning the turn passes to the next player and so on.<br/><br/>The board is made up of grass squares which are worth 1 point as well as flower squares which are worth 3 points. A player earns the points on the square in which he has a mushroom. The game ends when there are no more empty squares on the board and the winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/>Play online: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.popnspawn.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.popnspawn.com</a><br/><br/>",

It should appeal to anyone who enjoys spatial games and puzzles like the Rubik's Cube or strategic games like Chess.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is simple, capture as many stars as possible by creating black holes while preventing your opponents from doing the same. The game plays much like the pen and paper game boxes. Each turn the player draws one &quot;star&quot; token from the supplied cloth bag (Affectionately known as the &quot;nebula&quot; and places it into an empty region of &quot;space&quot; on the the board.<br/><br/>Once a certain threshold number of adjacent stars is reached the whole zone collapses into a black hole and the player who played the star captures all of the stars in the collapsed zone before playing another star. With more than two players the game becomes mind-bogglingly difficult to think more than one move ahead making the tactics almost impossible to work out.<br/><br/>The game ships with two play modes, a basic mode in which all stars score the same and a more complicated advanced game where players compete to not only capture the most stars but the highest scoring ones as well. The advanced game also introduces gravity charges that allow players to remove a black hole from the board if stuck.<br/><br/>All in all a great little time waster that will continue to be played for years to come.<br/><br/>",

At a Political Poll, Candidates can roll the die to access the 'Money Trail' &ndash; to collect funds - Deficit Dollars - from Interest Groups needed to acquire the support of Constituents.  The cost and benefit of each Constituent and the collection of Constituents owned or controlled by a Candidate are based on their Ideology.  Decisions must be made by the Candidates as to which Ideology they should chose or be to win: Conservative or Progressive.<br/><br/>Hope and Change can drastically affect a Candidate&rsquo;s quest for the White House, either advancing or hindering. This is where things can get &ldquo;dirty&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Towards the end, an election is held where two final Candidates compete in each of the 10 U.S. Regions to secure the majority (270) Electoral Votes needed to claim the White House.  Winning a region may seem as simple as rolling the highest die.  However, elections (die rolls) can be influenced by money, advertising and more.

The first player (or team) to complete the predetermined number of kilometers is the winner.<br/><br/>From the game box:<br/><br/>&quot;You and your friends are out bar hopping, when you suddenly realize that nobody can legally drive. So you all decide that the smartest thing to do would be to take a cab home. Great move, but here is where the twist in the game begins. While riding home in the cab, everyone falls asleep and starts to dream. These dreams turn into the worst nightmares of your life. Believe it or not, you actually start dreaming that you are driving home from the bar. Like most dreams, this one is just as crazy, as you will soon find out. When the dreams begin, so does the game. The only way to wake up and end these horrible nightmares is to win the game by being the first person, or team, to obtain the predetermined amount of kilometers set before starting the game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Four steering wheels anchor the Brain Shift game, with one wheel designated for each player. In the center of the game sits the stick shift, surrounded by six color (and numbered) lights: (1) red; (2) green; (3) yellow; (4) blue; (5) orange; and (6) white. During a game, players will shift to each of these lights according to the prescribed pattern.<br/><br/>There are six games in all:<br/>Stick Shift: Brain Shift calls out a player, followed by a color, the player must shift to that color.  Additional colors are added and the time to complete the shift decreases until only one player is left. Later on in the game, the timer in the game becomes so fast that the player is forced to 'shift' the color whilst it's being called out. Most notability, at later shift levels such as trying to get 14 shifts, the game will cheat the player at the very last shift. The last green on level 14 becomes impossible to shift to and will cause the player to fail. <br/>Memory Shift: Brain Shift calls out a player, plus a sequence of colors.  Players must shift to these colors or be eliminated.  Players are called in order.<br/>Who Shifts It: Just like Memory Shift except random players are chosen each turn.<br/>Ear Shift: A sound is associated to each light.  Brain Shift plays the sounds and players must shift to the appropriate color that is assigned to that sound to stay in the game.<br/>Secret Shift: Brain Shift gives you one color, then you must guess the others in 60 seconds.  One player only.<br/>Shift Around: Brain Shift provides a starting sequence.  Thereafter, each player adds one color after completing the previous sequence.<br/><br/>The game also has a hidden 'test mode'. To access the test mode, you must hold down the 'POWER' and 'PAUSE' buttons, remove battery cover, take out one battery 'not the top left or bottom left batteries' and then release the two buttons. You will hear a hidden 'Happy Birthday' music. If you shift green, you will hear most of the voices in the game. If you shift yellow, you'll hear the main menu music and if you shift blue, you'll hear most of the voices used in game and the gameplay background music. If you shift red you will hear a beep and if you shift white you'll hear the Happy Birthday music again. Don't shift white too many times or the game will shut off and exit test mode.<br/><br/>In 2018, Samtastic Games Studios successfully created a game called Mob Shift that remakes the Brain Shift toy for iOS and Android and it also works nicely on PC and Mac. Mob Shift version 2.0 can be downloaded from the iTunes Store and itch.lo for $1.99.<br/><br/>Windows, Mac Version Download link: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://samtastic.itch.io/mob-shift\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://samtastic.itch.io/mob-shift</a><br/><br/>iTunes Store link: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mob-shift/id1361156814\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mob-shift/id1361156814</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Early space exploration to the moon<br/><br/>A simple spin and move game based very much on the Jules Verne From the Earth to the Moon novel. The instructions describe a group of men who form the Cannon Club with the objective of firing a projectile (air coach) from a cannon to the moon. The players travel inside the air coach to the moon and return safely to earth.<br/>Two versions of this game exist. A large version (and possibly earlier) is titled &quot;The Journey to the Moon&quot;. This differs from the smaller version by name and having cards that determine the number of spaces a player moves during his turn. The smaller version uses a spinner to direct movement. The larger version includes metal playing pieces that are in the form of both men and women. The smaller version most likely used markers<br/>The playing board has the moon central and imaginary graphics of what space travel might be like in early 20th century. Players advance 35 spaces to reach the moon and another 35 to return to earth. The first player to reach the 70th space by direct number is the winner. Along the way, players landing on red numbers follow the rules to incur either a penalty or benefit.<br/><br/>Unknown German publisher but from the graphics and costumes on the playing pieces early 20th century.<br/><br/>",

The winner of this tournament is crowned the most powerful sorcerer in the entire world and becomes the head of the Council of High Mages. Wizard&rsquo;s Tournament for Kids is a fantasy deck building game of magic combat where players fight to defeat each other using spells, monsters, and relics. The game comes with thirty three different sets of cards composed of six copies of that specific card.<br/><br/>During play, each player starts the game with nine copies of the Spirit card, which is his starting deck. Cards are purchased from the twelve active stacks of cards and placed in a player&rsquo;s discard pile. Once a player&rsquo;s deck runs out of cards, the player shuffles his discard pile together to make a new deck. The changing sets of cards means that every time you play Wizard&rsquo;s Tournament for Kids, it is a brand new but balanced game. Spells cards allow a player to manipulate, heal, and damage monsters, your opponent, and yourself. Monsters are brutal attackers and valiant defenders that you can summon to your side during a battle to protect you from rampaging monsters and attack your opponent. Relics are ancient artifacts that give a player a special power that can be used each turn. Each player starts with thirty Life and if you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Life to zero, you win the game.<br/><br/>This Deck Building Game Includes:<br/><br/>     12 Monster Cards<br/>     15 Spell Cards<br/>     6 Relic Cards<br/>     Spirit Cards<br/><br/><br/>",

Winning is also achieved by having 4 sequential royal cards of a suite and as the only player at the end of the turn to do so. Number cards can be played to attack when 4 cards in sequential order are played. Knives can remove cards of one suite from the play area, Thieves can steal all of a players cards, Swords can discard cards, Moon cards replicate other powers and also can eliminate a player. When playing cards, at least 2 cards in sequential order must be played. The challenge is deciding on whether to use the cards for their bidding value, save them to build sets or play them on  the table to show people what you are collecting.<br/><br/>",

He and all other players use cards to write the destiny of the protagonist. Each card will have a part of your life. The game is divided into four seasons (child, youth, adult, elderly). At the end of each cycle, the cards played are checked to know what really happens in the protagonist's life and that will not happen. Points are earned with the cards that were successful. At the end of the game, whoever has the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>Will the protagonists be able to have command of your own life and win in the end? Or is that the other players will determine how it will be his life?<br/><br/>This is a fast game, created for fun, involving a bit of memorization, bluff and strategy. And luck, of course, exists in all of our lives (or not!). Enjoy it!<br/><br/>Ps.: Sorry for my english. It isn't my native language.<br/><br/>",

The game has 2-4 players moving on a board by roll of a die. Landing on a yellow TV space means the player must draw a TV card. This means a TV card - a player must collect 4 of the same kind - or a TV joker which completes a 3-card-set. Or if unlucky a broadcast interruption card. With this card still on his hand a player cannot win. Players landing on a blue TV ban spot must draw a TV ban card. This tells the player why the punishment by grounding occurred and usually instructs the player to give one TV card (of his/her choosing) to the next player. This is usually bad, of course it could be good if the broadcast interruption card can be offloaded onto someone else. A TV allowed card lets a player draw additional TV cards.<br/>The first player to either collect a set of 4 matching TV cards or reach the end of the board wins.<br/><br/>",

The game is played with small colored glass stones on a 19x19 vinyl mat that rolls up into a tube-like box, and is organized into three difficulty levels: Basic, Intermediate, and Advanced.  Like its ancestor and contemporaries, WU is played by taking turns placing the stones on grid points.<br/><br/>At the Basic level, the winning condition is simply to place five pieces in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  The Intermediate Level adds the winning condition of seizing five pairs of the opponent's stones.  Unlike Pente, these stones are left on the board, not removed.  Players are required to notify their opponent of the danger of seizure, by saying &quot;Chiau Tsi&quot; or &quot;stones seized.&quot;  Advanced difficulty adds the use of sand timers to force players to think quickly when making their every move.  Though two sets of stones are included, the instructions allow that up to four can play with additional colors of stones.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simple easy to learn abstract tile laying game. Player's take turns laying down tiles trying to enclose their own color while blocking their opponent(s).<br/><br/>The tiles are double-sided with mirrored images so opaque bags are needed to draw the tiles from. You score enclosed spots by squaring their number. Larger groups are worth way more but are riskier to accomplish.<br/><br/>This game came about while trying to find games to use up some domino tiles, as such they were made to stick onto them although cardboard works just fine.<br/><br/>",

The Knights were the warlords whom held power over the four<br/>lands of Arxlandia. Constantly at war over territory, The Knights soon grew weary of rebuilding their Knightdoms and decided to take their battles to the battle grounds of Arxlandia. An ancient battle ground where the epic warriors of past times still do battle and sometimes can be recruited.<br/><br/>Board<br/><br/>The board itself is based on the classic hexagon design but it the purpose and the game play is very unique.It forces players to think strategically before each move as there are several possible moves for each roll.The board consists of hexagons which will allow the players to move around. There will be obstacles that the players cannot cross. Obstacles such a rivers and mountains; players can only move from hexagon to hexagon. In places where there are bridges or mountain passes, the player may go from one the hexagon where the ridge/mountain pass begins to the where it ends. The movement will be determined by the roll of the dice. The players may move in any direction but may not cross the same hexagon in the same turn.<br/><br/>There are several hexagons that will be marked including the starting position of each player. Other marked positions include places to assume command of fighting units (draw cards).<br/><br/>There are 100 cards total split into 4 groups. Each group consists of different class of units.<br/><br/><br/>        Yellow cards are Ranged Units: Longbow man, Arbalist, Javelinmen, Slinger<br/>        Green cards are Infantry units: Swordsmen, Pikemen, Peasant, Macemen<br/>        Red cards are Cavalry units: Knight, Light Cavalry, Heavy Cavalry, Scouts<br/>        Blue cards are Artillery units: Trebuchet, Catapult, Scorpion, Heavy Crossbow<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Each unit has special bonus against other type of units.

Starting at the roller-coaster that bought the children into the magical Realm, the goal of the game is to reach the Vortex home.<br/><br/>Players navigate the board by rolling three dice; one for Movement and one for Adventuring, but must declare which one is prioritized before rolling; with the highest die roll being the prioritized one and the lowest die roll being the other (the middle scoring die roll is ignored). Players move clockwise around the board a number of squares equal to their Movement score.<br/><br/>Various illustrated Adventure Boxes present tasks that their Adventuring score must not be lower than otherwise the player remains on the square and has to try again next round. The Adventure Boxes and their scores are Armoured Warrior (6), River (4), Castle (6), Dragon (6), Wall (4), Village (0), Crevasse (5), Magician's Peak (6), Treasure (0), Desert (4), Lake (5), Spiders' Webs (6), Whirlwind (6), Castle Of Shadows (3), Venger (7), Tiamat (7) and Dungeon Master (5).<br/><br/>Players must draw a card from the deck when they land on a green square. Cards can be Monsters, Magical Items, Commands, Dungeon Master or Uni the unicorn. (Black-spotted cards indicate that the card is kept by the player.)<br/><br/>Monster cards are numbered and the player's Adventuring score must not be lower than it otherwise the player is moved back to the previous Adventure Box. The monsters and their scores are Frog (2), Wolf (3), Bullywug (4), Orc (5), Dragon (6), Lolth (7), Venger (8) and Tiamat (8).<br/><br/>Magical Item cards can be used by any player and provide bonuses with the bonus greater if the item belongs to the character (e.g.: Hank the Ranger and his Bow). The Magic Item cards are Bow, Cloak (which makes Sheila immune to the Brawl rule), Club (gives Bobby automatic success on Castle, Wall, Magician's Peak and Castle of Shadows), Hat (gives Presto random bonuses and penalties), Javelin (gives Diana automatic success on River, Castle, Wall, Crevasse and Magician's Peak) and Shield (prevents Eric going back to previous Adventure Box when losing against a monster).<br/><br/>Command cards can move the player forward two Adventure Boxes, backwards one Adventure Box, make them give their cards to the last player, make them give any magical items to their proper owners, negate missing a go on an orange square and select a card from another player.<br/><br/>The Dungeon Master card can be played once to automatically succeed on an Adventure Box and Uni the unicorn gives a bonus to either Movement or to Adventuring (but only when picking a monster card) throughout game play.<br/><br/>Players do nothing on yellow squares. Players miss-a-go on orange squares. Players sharing squares can swap cards and even steal them if the other player refuses.<br/><br/>To move from the outer track to the inner track the player must land on the Whirlwind where he is transported (if his Adventuring score is 6 or more) to the Castle Of Shadows and then continues (if his Adventuring score is 3 or more) around in a circle until he lands on the green square with an arrow pointing to the Vortex. If the card he has drawn does not result in him moving off of the arrowed square then he has won the game.<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/><br/>Game board x1<br/>Playing pawns x6<br/>Playing pawn stands x6<br/>Dice x3<br/>Instructions x1<br/>Cards x56 (see below for individual cards)<br/><br/>Dungeon Master card x1<br/>Uni card x1<br/>Frog card x1<br/>Wolf card x5<br/>Bullywug card x2<br/>Orc card x10<br/>Dragon card x5<br/>Lolth card x1<br/>Tiamat card x2<br/>Venger card x4<br/>Bow card x1<br/>Club card x1<br/>Cloak card x1<br/>Hat card x1<br/>Javelin card x1<br/>Shield card x1<br/>&quot;Give Your Cards To The Last Player&quot; card x2<br/>&quot;Do Not Miss-A-Go&quot; card x2<br/>&quot;Pick Any Card You Want&quot; card x2<br/>&quot;Go Back One Adventure Box&quot; card x2<br/>&quot;Advance Two Adventure Boxes&quot; card x4<br/>&quot;Give Object To Its Owner&quot; card x6<br/><br/>",

His challenger, Mitt Romney, survived an at-times brutal primary season to emerge the victor. Can you run a campaign to lead your candidate to victory?<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a set number of cards: several common cards that represent issues (such as Economic Growth or Immigration), demographics (such as Hispanics or Single Women) or regions (such as the Midwest or the Northeast). Each candidate also has many candidate specific cards with special abilities. Each player secretly forms an &quot;Agenda&quot; with these cards. Each player then also places Campaign Tokens--representing the efforts and money they put into campaigning--on each of these Agenda cards (or on random events that want to &quot;spin&quot; their way&quot;). These Agendas and tokens are revealed simultaneously and resolved.<br/><br/>Players earn support in each &quot;Swing State&quot; (the game starts with 16 swing states, although more can be added as the game progresses) by &quot;winning&quot; these issues, demographics, or special abilities. Players battle these states until election day, when the electoral votes are awarded and a victor is determined. Other campaign tactics--such as selecting a Vice President, gaining grassroots support, and using advertising to change a region's major concern about issues--also come into play.<br/><br/>This is a print and play game.

You can use a coin, counter or button for the ball.<br/><br/>Place the ball in the centre and the pack face downwards at the side of the table. One player begins by turning the top card face up on to the table, and then moves the ball according to the following rules, with the object of moving it into the opposite goal.<br/>If the card is a red one, then the red player moves, and the black player moves if the card is a black one. For odd numbers move the ball one square in any direction; for even numbers move the ball two squares in any direction, including a &ldquo;bent&rdquo; move, which is one sideways and one forward. If it is a court card, move the ball one square sideways, either way.<br/><br/>When a goal is scored, replace the ball in the centre and continue play until the end of the pack is reached, when you can shuffle them and replace face down&not;wards on the table and continue.<br/><br/>The winner is the first to score a number of goals previously decided.<br/><br/>",

You will require one counter, pencil and paper and a pack ot playing cards to consist only of the ace, 2, 3, 4, s. 6 of each suit. You will find it a most enjoyable game for two.<br/>1.    First choose your teams and write them down on a sheet of paper in score-card form.<br/>2.    Toss for innings. That is, cut the pack and the one with the highest card (the ace counts as one) chooses whether to bat or bowl.<br/>3.    The batting side places the counter on the starting square and the bowler proceeds to bowl the ball by taking off the top card in the pack.<br/>4.    The batsman moves the counter according to the number turned up by the bowler&mdash; the ace counts as one&mdash;and the score shown by the square on which the counter lands is put down on the score sheet for the first batsman. But remember that extras are not included in a batsman&rsquo;s individual score but are added below the score to make the total.<br/>5.    The bowler bowls again and the score is now put down for the second batsman. The game continues thus&mdash;bowling to the two opening batsmen alternately.<br/>6.    When a batsman is out, continue playing alternately with the man left and the next batsman.<br/>7.    Carry on round the board until the tenth wicket falls and the last man is then left &ldquo;not out&quot;.<br/>8.    The other side then bats and scores as before.<br/><br/>The one with the highest total score is, of course, the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Partymaster game is a simple and fun board game. It can be played in teams or as single players. The game consists of six pieces, where every single piece symbolizes a personality of the Partymaster Family.<br/> If you are more than five people playing the game, we recommend that you team up. In this way, everyone has a chance of being a part of the experience.<br/> There is a challenge card inside the game box, and with that, everything will be explained for you. It only takes a couple of minutes to read this card through, and understand the game. So the game is very simple and easy to learn.<br/> The average time of a game varies from 30mins to several hours. It depends on how creative and willingly you are to be integrated in the game experience.<br/><br/>Gameplay: You or your team pick a brick. You can choose any brick except the green one, which is the pukemaster. Now you pick a challenge with your opponents that the looser shall do. You roll the dice to figure out who starts. <br/>The game mecanic is dice rolling. The teams throw the dice in turns and move the brick until the number is stated on the cube. Every field you land on from now has a picture that refers to the challenge card. The challenge card states what must happen when a person lands on a field. This could be &quot;Give a Pitch&quot; which means that one team should sing 10 seconds of a song, then point at another team that has to continue the singing in 10 seconds. If they can, your team have to drink two sips, if they cannot then they have to drink three sips. <br/>The reason that you cannot pick the pukemaster is that when you land on his field, then you have to down your drinks and become the pukemaster that takes sips when everyone else does. So you don't want to be the pukemaster. <br/>The game continues over 37 fields and finishes when the goal is reached.<br/><br/>",

The game board consists of an 8x8 grid of squares, with 64 square playing pieces in the following combination: 8 Junctions, 28 Diagonals, and 28 Crosses.  Each square has a red and a blue line, in one of three of the aforementioned patterns.<br/><br/>In the competitive game, players choose blue or red, and take turns placing their pieces in an attempt to be the first to connect all four sides of the board with paths of their color.  Several methods of drawing pieces are provided in the rules, ranging from complete chance to a perfect knowledge of each other's pieces.  Variations are also provided for winning by reaching different objectives or scores.<br/><br/>Solitaire games include shuffling and drawing the pieces at random while trying to complete objectives such as placing all the pieces without mismatching the colored lines.<br/><br/>Included in the instructions are 56 diagrams of the board and pieces featuring only the red lines; assembling these designs reveals the whole picture.<br/><br/>",

Players use deductive reasoning and estimate probability to overcome elements of luck.  The game board is a large sheet of paper covered by clear plastic.  Equipment consists of a grease pencil, 6 small wood player markers, two dice, and three decks of cards.  One set of cards is the Computer Action deck, including fifty gold-colored cards each with an instruction for the player to follow when instructed by the board.  The two other sets of cards, one blue and one green, are the Keyword decks, with names of countries (blue) and names of sports (green.)<br/><br/>On the board are three areas.  First, the Logic Path along which player markers are moved; this path has hundreds of thousands of possible variations and changes through the course of the game.  Instructions are written in each section of the path.  Second, the Output Buffers are six areas players use for spelling out their Keywords.  Third are the Subroutines, located on the board's bottom right corner.  These direct players either to change the path of logic or to move letters back and forth from the Output Buffers.<br/><br/>Players randomly draw one of each Keyword cards, then take turn rolling dice to determine how many steps to move their markers along the Logic Path.  The instructions of whatever section they land on are then followed, and quite a lot of complexity results between the rules for movement and the instructions from the board.  Players are awarded letters of their Keywords by making complete circuits of the logic board.  The winning player is first to spell out his Keywords in their entirety in his Output Buffers.<br/><br/>",

The play is very simple and has an obvious link with bowling: each player must push (or let it go) the car in the track. At the end of the track the car will hit a basket with balls. The balls will spread over a board with holes, numbers and pins, representing obstacles and its values. The balls will eventually hit some pins and enter a few holes. The player&acute;s score is the sum of the points of every hole where a ball fell.<br/><br/>A copy was available at &quot;Museu do Brinquedo&quot; (Toy Museum) in Sintra, Portugal.

With experience, each player should be able to comfortably handle a battalion size unit of 500 to 100 men.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Time: 1 turn = five minutes.<br/>Ground Scale: 1&quot; - 15 yards.<br/>Figure Scale: 1 15mm casting = 3-5 men.<br/>              1 5mm stand = 3-5 men.<br/>              1 artillery or machinegun casting = 1 gun<br/>              Each vehicle/aircraft = 1 vehicle/aircraft<br/><br/>",

Scores are tallied according to each players' hand, with an advantage being given to those who have all three words We, Wow, and Wang.  In a 2 to 4 player game, a player with 500 points wins.

During gameplay, players roll four die, (with 3 chances to reroll) and play accordingly. Players receive rain, and from their stores, may choose to harvest their crops for points. However, rolling a drought depletes the rain already received, making it difficult to harvest the crops and thus receive points.

Seven Gods of Fortune is a set collection card game in which players earn favors from the Seven Gods of ancient Japan by praying at a temple built each round. A set of four cards of a single God gains one favor, while a set of one of each of the Seven Gods gains two favors. The first to six completed favors, wins.<br/><br/>A good memory and keen eye can help predict the return of the Seven Gods as the deck recycles, while the Gods of Justice and Winds are on hand to mix things up. Some cards have Powers of the Gods and at times it may be more important to play than pray, or even complete a favor.<br/><br/>Specific cards are added for three player, four player and team games; and patience-style solo-play is supported. Optional rules are suggested to speed up and simplify the game considerably for younger gamers.<br/><br/>May fortune see you upon the path to enlightenment but remember, you'll need more than just good luck...<br/><br/>",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.<br/><br/>This is a monopoly like game, sponsored by the Beech Grove United Methodist Youth Group.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "La Aventura Fantistica (Spanish for &quot;A Fantasy Adventure&quot;) is a Spanish game based on the Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon consisting of 92 cards that are split into 4 decks of 23 cards. (The decks are Hank the Ranger's bow, Diana the Acrobat's javelin, Presto the Magician's hat and pouch, and Bobby the Barbarian's club and helmet with these images printed on the reverse of the cards.)<br/><br/>In each shuffled deck there are 10 Adventure cards marked with the letter A, 4 Dragon cards marked with the letter D, 4 Dungeon cards marked with the letter M (&quot;mazmorass&quot; is Spanish for dungeon), 2 Force cards marked with the letter F, 1 Bifurcation card marked with the letter B, 1 Exit card marked with the letter S (&quot;salida&quot; is Spanish for exit) and 1 Treasure card marked with the letter T. The aim of the game is to pick a card each turn and win by collecting 3 Dragon cards, 1 Exit card and 1 Treasure card.<br/><br/>Dragon cards can be collected by using a previously picked Force card against it, with the Force card then being discarded. If the player has no Force card then instead he can roll the dice; a star result means he has defeated the dragon and can keep the Dragon card, a result of 4 means a stalemate and he must discard the Dragon card but a result of 1 to 3 means he has been defeated and must reshuffle his entire deck (current deck, discarded cards and kept cards) and start again. Alternatively, the player can decide to not roll a dice, discard the Dragon card and in future he picks from a different deck; whether occupied by another player or not.<br/><br/>Picking a Dungeon card means that the player must miss a go and discard this card. Picking a Bifurcation card means that the player must pick from another deck for the next turn only and discard this card. Adventure cards do nothing and are discarded. Each deck has its own discard pile; there is not one central discard pile made up from different decks.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, the play roll all four dice and then split them into pair with one poker die and one regular die in each set. The poker die determines the unit type and the regular die determines the unit strength. The player will then secretly write down the unit and strength value in the terrain of his or her choice. At the end of the game (once each player has assigned a unit to each terrain) the units are revealed. Total strength values with any applicable modifiers are revealed and the player with the highest value wins the terrain.

        "description": "Triad is a two-phase abstract strategy game.<br/><br/>The game played on an 8x8 grid with the middle four spaces unavailable for play, leaving 60 playable spaces.  Of the 60 spaces, 40 are labeled &quot;3&quot; and the remaining 20 are labeled &quot;6&quot;, values which only apply during Phase 2.  Each player or team has 30 pyramid pieces available to play.  Play consists of two phases with an option of playing only one phase for children.<br/><br/>In Phase 1, players alternate turns and attempt to make as many triads as possible, scoring three points for each turn in which one or more Triads are made.  A placement which results in multiple Triads being formed still only scores three points.  Triads consist of three playing pieces in a row in any direction - diagonally or orthogonally, including a stack.  Playing pieces may not be stacked more than three high.  Score is kept in real time via a scoring track and moving plastic marker along the edge of the board.<br/><br/>In Phase 2, Triads are removed.  If the removal of a Triad reveals numbers on the board, those numbers - three or six - are added to the player's score.  If a Triad stack is removed, the single revealed number is doubled.  If a player has a Triad available to him to remove, he must remove it, even though it's to his strategic disadvantage.  If he cannot remove one, the other player or team plays until he has an available move or both players have no Triads that can be removed.  Keeping track of number placement when laying Triads is strategically wise.<br/><br/>",

Each round involves one set of partners bidding on a trump suit, cards are played around the table as the bidding team tries to win the required number of tricks. Between rounds, a battle map is updated with results. The goal is for one team to capture the center hex on the map. Depending on board position and hand results, partners may earn 'reinforcement' draws in future rounds to make their hands stronger.<br/><br/>Partners may discuss board position between rounds, but within a round they must anticipate other player actions. Some example decisions: &quot;My partner has this trick so far - should I play trump or save it for later?&quot; and &quot;My opponent called trump - should I draw some of it out?&quot;<br/><br/>Differences between Dwarven and traditional Euchre include fantasy-themed cards, the battle map, sorcerer wildcards, and reinforcement draws. The rules contain example play and a two-player version.<br/><br/>",

Each player has 2 of each type to begin with and can recover a used card upon drowning an opponent soldier. The 3 cards are:<br/><br/>Bomb card: destroys a block adjacent to the soldier on turn.<br/>Swap card: swaps the soldier on turn with an adjacent friendly soldier.<br/>Barricade card: creates a barricade block on an empty tile of the board adjacent to the soldier on turn. Barricades are neither movable, destroyable, or mountable.<br/><br/>Drowning: A soldier is drowned when it is his own turn to move but there is no move available other than to use a card. The drowned soldier will then be removed from the board along with the block it is standing on.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand is a zombie themed take on Texas Hold'em, a community card poker game, with game play focused as much on the betting as on the cards being played. Some of the terms (blinds/river) have been changed here to more zombie centric ones (appetizers/blood), while others have been kept (flop/turn/showdown) for hopefully obvious reasons. Gameplay is the same as Hold&rsquo;em except the criteria for determining and ranking winning hands has been changed due to the style of cards used in this version of the game.<br/><br/>To better understand these rankings, it is necessary to explain the makeup of cards in Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand. In stead of the regular playing card deck used for Texas Hold'em, this deck is first made up of four types of zombies: Walkers, Shamblers, Runners, and Infected. There are twelve cards for each type of zombie. These twelve cards for each type are further divided into Red and Green colored text, with six of each zombie type. Each zombie card also has two numbers, a Decomposition number and a Hunger number ranging from one to six. These numbers and colors are arranged in such a way that each zombie has three other zombies (one of each type) that match it in both color and numbers. Thus, with these card differences, the criteria used for hand rankings is changed while keeping the dealing/betting/bluffing aspects of regular Hold'em.<br/><br/>Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand is played on a single table with 2 to 10 players. The game is also played with an assortment of chips for the betting rounds. Traditional poker chips can be used or you can try our &quot;Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand: Poker Chips of the Living Dead&quot; (available separately) for a set of zombie themed chips.<br/><br/>The goal is simple: win as many chips as you can, one pot at a time. You win a pot by having the best hand, or by having all other players fold before the showdown. As in Texas Hold'em, a hand of Dead Man&rsquo;s Hand consists of one to four betting rounds. A hand ends when all players but one have folded, or the fourth and final betting round completes with multiple players still in the hand - whichever comes first. At that point, players enter into the showdown, where remaining players discover who has the best hand.<br/><br/>",

The darker colors remain on the bottom half until the pieces are promoted and turned over; this way, players are able to see which pieces beneath a stack have been promoted.     <br/>    <br/>    Players' beginning positions and movements are the same as ordinary Checkers, with the exception that upon jumping over an opponent's piece, instead of removing it from the board, it is stacked upon by the capturing player. Stacks are controlled by the piece on top, ordinary or promoted, unless the other player captures the top piece and frees one of his own below. To win, the opposing player's pieces must all be buried under stacks or incapable of moving.<br/><br/>",

Each player selects the rule that he/she will play by for that round, based on his/her hand. So each player will be playing the round by a different set of rules.

Along with your play calls, this helps determine the results of plays, and, ultimately, the winner of the game. It's assumed coaches (you and your friends) have a basic understanding of the rules of football.

This will give your games the flavor of coaching a specific team without upsetting competitive balance.<br/><br/>",

No matter whether a cottage garden is growing at home, a garden plot is thriving on the outskirts of town, or a few flower boxes embellish the balcony, in Welt des Gartens, players with a green thumb deeply immerse themselves in the world of their hobby &ndash; and in doing so, even the most experienced gardener will learn something new.<br/><br/>Before starting the game, players agree on how many questions they'll face. Each turn, one player reads a question from the card; the question has multiple answers listed below it, and 1-3 answers will be correct &ndash; but there's no way of knowing how many are right ahead of making your guess.<br/><br/>After the active player reads off the answers, each player can place 1-3 guess markers on the numbers matching those answers. When the player reveals the correct answers, anyone who guessed incorrectly scores no points, no matter how many other answers they got right. Players who guessed correctly with all of their placed tokens score as many points as the number of tokens they placed.<br/><br/>After finishing the agreed upon number of questions, whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

This game takes place several weeks into the infection at a point where the zombies seem to have the upper hand; not only in numbers but also in mutated ability. Four humans surviving together have taken refuge in a country side manor. On the run, down to just knives and pistols, and being stalked by countless zombies that are leading a monster directly to them, the survivors hold themselves up and wait for rescue within the halls of the zombie manor.<br/><br/>The game pits a team of 4 survivors against a team of zombies; each team consists of at least 1 player per side with up to 4 players on each team.  The game takes place on a grid based board detailing the basement, first floor, 2nd floor, and grounds of an abandoned manor.<br/><br/>The goal of the survivor team is to hold out within the manor grounds for 20 rounds at which point a rescue vehicle spawns. They must then make it to the rescue vehicle with at least 2 survivors making it to safety in order to win.  The survivor team can scavenge for items, barricade doors and windows with furniture and wood, and seek out strategic locations within the manor or its grounds to help aid them through the game (60+ weapons, health items, equipment, zombie traps, and weapon upgrades).<br/><br/>Alternatively, the survivor team can kill the zombie team boss character, The Harvester, thereby ending the zombie teams ability to spawn more zombies.  Once all zombies are cleared the survivor team wins.<br/><br/>The goal of the zombie team is to kill all of the survivor characters in order to win.  The zombie team gains 'spawn points' at the beginning of every round that can be saved up or spent on the 7 different classes of zombies available.  Each class costs a varying number of spawn points depending on their stats: movement speed, health, attack dmg, and special ability.  The zombie team also controls a zombie boss character, The Harvester.  The Harvester is the strongest and most versatile zombie of the game but if it is destroyed the zombie team can no longer spawn zombies.<br/><br/>",

From the original Poker-themed games to &quot;Liberty Bell&quot; - the first true slot machine as we know it today - to the complex electronic games of today, the slots have become the world's most popular casino game.  JACKPOT SLOTS brings the excitement of the casino to the board game table.<br/><br/><br/>JACKPOT SLOTS is the umbrella title for two slot-machine themed games:<br/><br/>WINNING LINES is the flagship game.  As cards are dealt from a deck of cards bearing slot machine symbols, players seek to claim &quot;winning lines&quot; - combinations of slot machine symbols that pay off - before a lemon card turns up to end the round.<br/><br/>TRIPLE PLAY is a slot machine take on &quot;Memory&quot; in which players seek to uncover &quot;winning lines&quot; while, yet again, avoiding lemon cards.<br/><br/><br/>The allure of the slots is before you!  Are you lucky enough to hit the Jackpot?<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle Tank: Escape from Giant Robot Island is a modular strategy board game for 2-4 players which pits battle tanks against giant robots. The players take on one of four roles, Mad Scientist Dr. Victor von Mechanstein, Sergeant Roger Stammel, OSI Agent Cynthia Collins or henchmech E-Gore Mk.IV.<br/><br/>Gameplay progresses in turns with each player moving their token(s) then resolving attacks before play passes to the next player. Each unit has a set movement rate and attacks are resolved by rolling a six-sided die (D6) and then comparing the number rolled to the range and the target's armor.<br/><br/>Each character has two of its own, often opposing, goals. One goal is active and ends the game on the turn it is achieved, and the other goal is passive and is only checked after 10 turns have been played. Mechanstein wants to prevent his tanks from being taken off the island, Stammel simply wants to escape with his soldiers, Collins wants intelligence on the Mad Scientist's forces and E-gore wants to please its master by recapturing the prisoners.<br/><br/>Each turn the tank players move toward the beach as more and more robots appear to stop them.<br/><br/>The action is modified by two sets of cards: Mad Scientist Events and Tanker Tactics. Events are large scale effects that change the game in some way or affect all the players tics are short and Tactics are minor effects that can give a boost to many actions as well as repair damage, improve speed or even find a new tank if one has been destroyed.<br/><br/>The playing area itself consists of 7 hexagonal tiles with a hex-grid printed on them. One tile is Mechanstein's volcanic lair and the other six are unique combinations of roads, cliffs, forests and open terrain. The non-volcano tiles can be rotated to any orientation and placed into one of several formations and are designed in such a way to always have the roads match up.<br/><br/>",

The object is to create the best hand; outscoring other players and possibly defeating the pit for extra points. It has an easy to learn, multi-level scoring system that allows players to be creative when building a hand. Each player keeps a camp, where they can secure cards for future hands.<br/><br/>Gameplay overview:<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 7 cards from which they have to make a four card hand.  Players put one card into the center as their Pit card.  They then have two cards left over for their Camp which rolls from turn to turn allowing players to always have two cards in reserve for future hands.<br/><br/>Scoring is based on card icons such as tribe, class, bone value, and Pit strength.  All of these icons allow for different ways to score points each hand.<br/><br/>",

In order to win, a player needs skill, foresight, cunning, and a little bit of luck. Each player puts together his team and battles for honor, glory, and control of the truth! Each Cogito card is designed to have different crazy, fun, and occasionally mean abilities while representing and reflecting actual people and subjects within philosophy. The game balances a charming trio of gags, competitiveness, and intellectual ability. Players will experience game-play that quickly switches between moments of serious deliberation about the meaning of life to sudden requests to employ funny accents, all in one game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A biathlon-themed roll-and-move trivia game with a dexterity component.<br/><br/>Aim of the game: Be the first to complete the course on the board three times.<br/><br/>How it is played: <br/>Players take turns rolling the two dice. If their pawn is on a ascending slope space at the beginning of their turn, they roll only one die. They move their pawn according to the die roll. <br/>If it lands on a grey space, nothing happens. If it lands on a green space, an action card is drawn and the action performed (move pawn backwards/forwards a certain number of spaces, lose a turn etc.). <br/>If it lands on a yellow space, a question card is drawn and the active player has to answer a biathlon-related question. If they succeed, their pawn advances five spaces. If they fail, they go back five spaces.<br/>If the pawn lands on a blue space, they have to go back to start.<br/>If a player rolls the same number on both dice, they gain a fan token, which grants them extra movement in round three.<br/>Since the game is about biathlon, there is also a shooting exercise that takes place after rounds one and two: Players have to hit a target with a wooden marble, using a wooden catapult. Generally, each player has five shots per round to hit the five targets, but shooting cards may allow them to reload. Each missed target means extra spaces to complete in a penalty round.<br/><br/>",

Each tile shows a building, which will belong to the player when played on the board but is not considered &quot;built&quot; until it has its required resources.  Resources are on the back-side of the buildings (the players must decide which buildings to not play so they can place resources), but resources on the board have no &quot;owner&quot; so they can be used by buildings belonging to any player.  Once a building has its resources it is now &quot;built&quot; and gains the owner points or special abilities (the player may now build in the mountains, the player draws extra tiles, etc.).<br/><br/>The players each have the same starting pile of tiles, with another set of &quot;advanced tiles&quot; available to any player, most of which actually require other buildings as &quot;resources&quot; themselves.<br/><br/>",

The game emulates the situation in the world during the era of sailing boats before the construction of the Suez Canal.<br/><br/>Depending on the number of players, each one of them has at their disposal a number of resources to place in their geographic regions and boats. Each player must decide their strategy to follow during the game in order to achieve the score fixed for the victory.<br/><br/>Both the conquest of empty geographic regions and the forecast of the movements of your opponents are crucial to keep ongoing your choices to win the game. Most of the resources to run the game are normally shipped in your boats, sometimes you'll need more load capacity in your army to assure a final alpha strike attack and others just quick boats to colonize or steal your opponent's assets.<br/><br/>All these matters have been taken into account to provide you a real laboratory of the world&rsquo;s geostrategy at the 17th and 18th centuries.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game themed on the German movie of the same title. Willi, a reporter, is traveling around the world and takes the players with him to tell them about the wonders of the world.<br/><br/>Aim of the game: All players try to reach the wonders depicted on their cards with the balloons on the game board. Whoever is first to reach five of his/her wonders and takes a picture of them wins the game.<br/><br/>Setup: Each of the five balloon pieces is put on the corresponding starting point of the board. Each player gets three Willi chips, three compasses and three pips to go with the compasses. The cards are shuffled and each player gets a hand of five cards. Players only see their own cards. The remaining cards form the draw deck.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The game is played in several rounds, and each round consists of several legs: rolling the colour die to select a balloon for the round (all players move the same balloon during a round), discarding a card and drawing a new one (optional), choosing directions by marking them with the pip on their compasses, and moving the balloons on the board according to the directions on the compasses. If the balloon lands on a space that shows a wonder that is depicted on a player's card, he/she &quot;takes a picture&quot; (says &quot;Click!&quot; and reads the information about the wonder from his/her card) and draws a new card.<br/><br/>Balloon movement in more detail: Balloon movement is done in three stages per round. First, the start player chooses one of his/her three compasses, then the next player etc. until all players have resolved all their three compasses. A player may choose not to move the balloon if they don't want to use a particular direction on one of their compasses, but they may not use that compass again in the same round.<br/>Spaces occupied by another balloon or a Willi chip (put on a space that the balloon leaves) are skipped. If a balloon reaches the edge of the board in north or south direction, no further movement in that direction is possible; the eastern and western edges of the map allow crossing over to the other side.<br/><br/>",

The big difference comes when a checker is captured. Instead of just returning where they came from, they turn into zombies, roaming the board controlled by a set of rules out of the players control.<br/><br/>Save your survivors before they get turned against you by bringing them all into your safe house. But be careful, as long as there are survivors left outside no one is safe.<br/><br/>When both players have all their survivors (or what's left of them), the player with the most survivors win.<br/><br/>",

These are special event fields that make the players move their pawns forwards or backwards.<br/><br/>Each player gets a pawn (cardboard token showing the Pirelli mascot). Players take turns rolling a six-sided die. If you roll a six, you get to put your pawn on the start space. Afterwards, you move your pawn according to your die roll. If you roll a six, you get an additional turn. If you land on an event field, you follow the instructions for that field.

        "description": "Theme: The Winx are having a fashion show to trade their favourite outfits. But some of them will be so popular that only a die duel can decide who gets to wear them!<br/><br/>Components: The game consists of 24 catwalk cards, 12 Miss Magix cards and a die (apply stickers before first game).<br/><br/>Summary and aim of the game: Each round, players try to win as many catwalk cards as possible by using one of their Miss Magix cards. If more than one player wants the same catwalk cards, there is a die duel. The player who owns the most catwalk cards at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The 24 catwalk cards are shuffled and put in a face-down stack. Each player gets one Miss Magix card per colour (orange, pink, turquoise). <br/>The game is played in several rounds. <br/>At the start of a round, four catwalk cards are placed next to each other, face up. If cards are left over from the previous round, fill up to a total of four. <br/>Then, each player chooses one of their three Miss Magix cards and puts it down, face down. The colour of the Miss Magix card shows which catwalk card(s) you want to gain this round (i.e. if you put down an orange Miss Magix card, you are going for the orange catwalk card(s)). <br/>Players then turn over their Miss Magix cards simultaneously. If you are the only one to have chosen a particular colour, you immediately win that card. Players who were going for the same colour compete in a die duel.<br/>The die duel: All players taking part in a duel. Players take turns rolling the die. A star symbol means that the player stays in the duel, the Winx logo means the player is out of the duel, and a player who rolls the heart symbol isn't just out of the duel but can't use his/her currently used Miss Magix card in the next round (i.e. he/she only has two cards to choose from during that round). A duel ends when all participating players have rolled at least once per die rolling round and there is either only one player left (then he/she gets to take the catwalk cards the duel was about) or all duel participants are out (then neither of them gets to take the cards, they stay out for the next round).<br/>The game ends when the stack with the catwalk cards has been used up. The player with the most cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Lead the Winx in a magic die battle to defeat the Trix and get the crystals back!<br/><br/>Setup: A course is laid out with the 24 Winx tiles. Tiles with the same value (1-6) must not be placed next to each other. The 12 Trix cards are sorted into three stacks by value (4, 5 or 6). Each of the three stacks is shuffled and placed face down.

He/she can either stop then or continue. <br/>If you stop, you count the crystals that are laid out. If there are 4-6 crystals, you get to take the top Trix card from the corresponding stack. If there are fewer than four crystals, you get to take one of the Winx tiles that you have put a crystal on.<br/>If you continue, you roll again and put a crystal on the next Winx card with the number corresponding to the die roll (counted from the last crystal, not from the start of the game). If you cannot lay out more crystals (because the result of your die roll isn't shown on any further tiles of the course), you've taken too big a risk and have to remove all the crystals from the course. Your turn ends and you don't get to take a Trix card.<br/>Collected Winx tiles can be used to steal another player's Trix cards if you have collected Winx tiles in all the colours that are shown on the Trix card. The Winx tiles that were used to steal another player's Trix card are put at the beginning of the course.<br/><br/>A player who has collected each of the three Trix wins the game.<br/><br/>",

One player starts and rolls a die (numbered 2-7) and announces the result. The next player rolls the die and adds to or subtracts from the result (never going below 0 or above 15, so there is not always a choice). When a player reaches 0, 8 or 15, s/he can flip over the respective card. When a player calls a number of a card s/he already flipped over before, another player can say &quot;thank you&quot; and pick up a chip. A chip can be used to add or substract an additional point. The first player to flip over all three cards is the winner.<br/><br/>- Der Budgetausschuss:<br/>Same as above, but any player can shout out the result. First player to shout 0, 8 or 15 and covers an additional card with his/her hand gets to turn the respective card over. <br/>A player who announces a 5 or 10 must flip a card back.<br/><br/>- An der B&ouml;rse:<br/>Same as Expertenkommission, but the number at the bottom of the die counts. First player to shout the correct new number and covers a special &quot;A&quot; chip, continues the game.<br/><br/>- Der gro&szlig;e Wurf: <br/>This is a cooperative game with a time limit (the rules suggest 15 minutes). The (numbered) cards are randomly laid out, some with the colored side up, some with the black/white side up. As above, players roll the die and add or substract numbers. When 0, 8 or 15 are reached, the active player can change the position of one corresponding card with another one. If the number is reached by using the number at the bottom of the die, the players may flip over two grey cards which are already in the correct position. <br/>A roll of 2 that cannot be used gives the players a lobby handicap (flipping over a colored card). A second handicap leads to flipping over two cards, etc. When four lobby chips are collected, the game is lost. With an unused 7, the players can collect ecology chips with which they can counter the lobby chips.<br/><br/>The game was published in Austria and tries to show finding unusual solutions. It was supported by the Austrian government.<br/><br/>",

But the Winx are on their way, trying to reach Alfea to defend it. Will you and the Winx be able to reach Alfea first and win the most magic chips?<br/><br/>Aim of the game: Each turn, players try to move their pawn as far as possible on the course to Alfea. The sooner they reach Alfea, the more magic chips they win. After three rounds, if they have collected more magic chips than the Trix, they all win together and the player with the most magic chips is awarded for being the most courageous fairy.<br/><br/>Setup: The 23 path tiles are laid out to create the course to Alfea. The Trix pawn is placed on the &quot;red fountain&quot; space. 3 magic chips are put on the Alfea space. Each player chooses a Winx pawn and puts it on the starting space. The 48 flight chips are shuffled and placed at the center of the table. Each player draws three flight chips and puts them down in front of him/herself, face down.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The game is played in three rounds. Each round consists of several phases.<br/>First, each player choose one of their flight chips and puts them in their hand so that the other players can't see what colour it is. <br/>Next, players simultaneously reveal their chosen flight chip.<br/>All players that are the only one to have chosen a particular colour move forwards to the next tile of that colour. The starting place and the &quot;red fountain&quot; space are the only spaces that can take more than one pawn, otherwise occupied spaces are jumped over.<br/>Players who have chosen the same colour are banned for this round, they stay were they are.<br/>Used flight chips are removed from the game. When all flight chips have been resolved, each player draws a new chip so that they have three chips again.<br/>Lastly, at the end of each turn the trix pawn is moved one space towards Alfea.<br/><br/>A round can end in one of two ways:<br/>First, two player pawns have reached the Alfea finish space. The first player to reach Alfea receives two magic chips, the second one chip.<br/>Second, the Trix pawn reaches Alfea. The round ends immediately. All chips remaining on the Alfea space go to the Trix.<br/><br/>Then, the second round starts in the same way as the first. After three rounds, the chips won by the players and by the Trix are counted. If all players together have more chips than the Winx, they win the game together and the player with the most chips is considered the most courageous fairy. If the Trix have more magic chips, the players lose together.<br/><br/>",

Each dog card has a bladder value and one or more sniff symbols.  Boy dogs have more pee to deliver but will also stop more often to sniff things than girl dogs.<br/><br/>You earn a point for every dollar earned earned and for having your dogs &quot;mark&quot; (pee on) the fire hydrants around the board.  However, only three pee markers can be on any hydrant so if a fourth one gets added, the pee marker on the bottom of the stack goes away.<br/><br/>The next element of fun come from the action cards. Every time a dog stops on the board to sniff its required symbols, everyone gets to play one action card, such as &quot;tangled leash&quot;, &quot;dirty paws&quot; and &quot;squirrel!&quot; providing additional hindrance to their opponents or cards such as &quot;romp &amp; play&quot;, &quot;overactive bladder&quot; and &quot;holiday bonus&quot; to benefit their own cause.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a gambling game for two players and requires two dice, two counters and chips or money. The stakes are unlimited by anything except the players&rsquo; inclination or ability to pay.<br/>RULES OF PLAY<br/>1    The players take it in turn to throw both dice. The player with the higher score becomes Cat; the other, Mouse. They put the agreed stakes in the pots: Cat in her Kattepot on red 66 and Mouse in his Muizepot on black 66. Cat moves to the top left-hand corner of the board and Mouse to the bottom right.<br/>2    Cat begins the game by throwing both dice and preparing to move her counter along the Cat Walk - the red numbered squares - to square 3 if the dice show 2 and 1, square 4 if they show 3 and 1, square 5 if they show 2 and 3 or 4 and 1, and so on. If Cat throws a double 1 she moves to square 11, in which case Mouse must pay her two chips. If she throws a double 6 she pays two chips to Mouse and does not move. If she lands on 5 she loses her next turn, but if she lands on 10 she may throw again; if she lands on 4 or 9 she pays one chip to Mouse.<br/>3    Mouse now throws and moves in the same way down the Mouse Run - the black numbered squares - paying or receiving the same number of chips.<br/>4    Cat&rsquo;s turn again, and the same rules apply. But there are more: if Cat has to jump her counter over Mouse&rsquo;s, she pays him one chip; if she lands on square 15 she loses her next turn; square 20 gives her a second throw; and 16 means another chip paid to Mouse. If she is already past square 11 by this turn, a double 2 will take her to square 22 - otherwise it is only the total 4 that counts. If she lands on square 22, Mouse must pay her two chips.<br/>5    Mouse follows Cat, and Cat then follows Mouse again, each racing for the other&rsquo;s pot on square 66. The earlier rules still apply: landing on 22, 33,44 or 55 earns two chips; once past 22 a double 3 leads straight to square 33, and once past 33 two 4s lead to 44 and past that two 5s to 55. Once past 55 a double six is a passport straight to the pot. Before that a double 6 still means a lost turn and a forfeit of two chips to the other player. Landing on squares 25,35,45 or 65 means a lost turn, while achieving squares 30, 40, 50 or 60 gains a second throw; stopping on 25, 36, 49 or 64 entails paying over one chip to the other player.<br/>6    If Cat or Mouse throws a total which will take him or her beyond square 66, he or she has to turn back to 48. But the player who reaches 66 first WINS the game and takes both stakes.<br/><br/>The pictures on the board are taken from the works of three leading illustrators: the English artists Alfred Elwes and Harrison Weir, and the American Palmer Cox.<br/><br/>",

Around the castle are attacking cat images, each numbered as well.<br/><br/>The players, in clockwise order, throws 3 dice. The total shown by the dice will correspond to one of the attacking cats or one of the brave mice images on the board, and the player either pays into the bank or receives from it a proportion of the stakes.<br/><br/>Tripples are the favoured throw because this has special results. triple 1 to triple 4 are the corners of the castle. Double 5 is the drawbridge and triple 6 is the keep. Triple 1 to 5 lets the player collect half the stakes. Triple 6 allows the player to collect all the stakes.<br/><br/>",

In three games, the game expanded vocabulary and teach children to play together.<br/><br/>The game board consists of a colorful puzzle with a turntable in the middle. In total there are 6 rooms and each room has a different color. The game includes small slices with objects. On these disks are pictures of objects. These objects belong each to one specific room of the house. This can be checked at the back of the disk: Ex. the kitchen is shown as red and all disks that belong in the kitchen have a red back.<br/><br/>In the game, the vocabulary around the house is practiced in different games. One game it is cooperative: The players then play against the slob. Does the turntable in the attic? Then you can slob a place ahead. Does the arrow shows to another room? Then all the players together look at an object out of this room. When they indicate a correct disc, they can put it away.<br/><br/>Are all discs put away before the slob is on the last box? Then you all won the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Do you learn the Dutch language? Spelling has no secrets for you anymore? Whether you are a player who just have to have the tactical moves? 'Quartaal' is a tactical language game.<br/><br/>'Quartaal' is a language game that can be played on multiple levels. On every question card are questions from different levels (level 2nd to 6th grade). Players get at the beginning of the game one or more game cards, depending on the number of game boards that they play. It can be played with 1 game board for the first time, making the game easier, but it can be extended to 4 game boards.<br/><br/>Players try to complete their tasks as well as possible to earn points. They answer every 'language-question' which is asked by another player and earn blocks. These blocks must be placed on a game board. It is important to play tactically, score many points and make opponents to lose points.<br/><br/>The system is very well organized. By using multiple game boards, the game becomes harder and more tactical. Unfortunately, there are few (60) double-sided question cards for the second through the sixth grade. Although they are printed on both sides, but it still gives only 120 orders per year.<br/><br/>",

It is a transformation of checkers with the difference that the pawns move forwards, right or left, but they capture diagonally.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to reach the opponent's side of the board or to eliminate all the opponent's pawns.<br/>Each player has 14 pawns at the beginning of the match<br/>The capturing is obligatory<br/><br/>1. The pawns can only move forwards, left or right, one square at a time, changing the colour of the square.<br/>2. A pawn making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pawns. Only one pawn may be captured in a single jump; however, when possible the player must perform multiple jumps in one move.<br/>3. The pawns capture opposing pawns by jumping over them to the nearest square of the same colour. To do this they may only move diagonally in four directions, not to the left or to the right, forwards or backwards.<br/>4. Captured pawns are removed from the chessboard.<br/><br/>",

A system of points is used to evaluate damage to ships - how much speed and armament they lose.  Torpedoes are fired by pointing a marker in a certain direction and moving it as the torpedo moves.  An umpire is necessary in the game because many arguments will arrise about hits and misses, and many additional factors can be included in the game with an umpire.<br/><br/>",

It was submitted to the One Game A Month project.<br/><br/>Players move pieces from their back row in a manner similar to checkers, that is diagonally forward. However, pieces can also move directly backwards one space, allowing for advance and retreat. Taking of opponent's pieces is limited to manoeuvring behind the other player's counters from the side; hence the name.<br/><br/>Basic strategy involves the creation of temporary vertical or horizontal lines, as both of these patterns prevent to a legal take manoeuvre; the former prevents (in the short term) the opponent from being able get to the side, the latter the completion of a take because the rear of pieces are protected. However, such structures are not sustainable for long, especially as players lose pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game for 2-4 players is superficially similar to GO, with players taking turns laying stones on a 11 x 11, 16 x 16 or 19&times;19 grid of intersections. However, unlike Go where placed pieces are static or captured, Mynd (the Welsh word for go) shows its diversity using a push/pull mechanic that allows lines of pieces to be moved along lines (horizontally or vertically), according to a simple tug-of-war mechanic. Therefore, this is more an ongoing battle that the traditional game, with the status of claimed territory being under constant attack as walled off sections of the board are pressured by force of numbers. The game ends when there is no legal move left, the board fills up, or, more often, when both players agree to end it, at which time whoever controls the most territory wins.<br/><br/>As an additional game reusing the Go aesthetic, utilising the same general-purpose grid and colored stones, it is hoped this will join the variety of other abstract strategy games that can be played with a Go set, such as  Connect6, Go-Moku, Pente, and others.<br/><br/>",

S/he then gives the model a name made out of two words, such as &quot;red dragon&quot;, &quot;stomping elephant&quot;, &quot;birthday cake&quot;, etc. and begins a story with that element. The next player does the same, but must use both the first model and his/her own (in that order!) in the story, etc. A player who makes a mistake (i.e. saying fire dragon) is penalized by having to take the model back. Elements that return to the field may be re-named, adding to the chaos. The spinner also has some color fields with special properties. <br/>The goal of the game is to get rid of one's one models first. Of course, it can be varied by adding your own models.<br/><br/>Set # 50004<br/>Item # 6024947<br/><br/>",

Coins may be used to capture and fortify areas of the backyard and play various strategic Action Cards in order to out-maneuver and outplay the enemy gnome clans.<br/><br/>",

A character card is giving each player an additional secret goal to achieve and add happiness points at the end of the game. Money is tight, though, and &quot;bad&quot; cards (accidents, and so on) can cost you a lot of money. There are also cards which cost you a fee each round (mobilephone).<br/>On their turn, players draw the topmost card of a huge draw deck. Either he gets it (the bad cards are a forced purchase) or trades them directly to other players, getting the cost himself. He can also discard a card and take the next one - at his own risk.<br/>At the end, happiness points are added. Money counts a half happiness point for each unit. The player with the most happiness wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Sweeping plains, rugged mountains and deep oceans spring into existence at your command, twisting and crashing into your rival's lands in a colossal battle of will. Then&mdash;by your grace&mdash;the world will be filled with life; be it by brawn or brain, your creations will vie for dominance. Fanged monstrosities, indomitable swordsmen, educated scholars, suave traders... Anything you can imagine, you may create; the Challenge will support their method of battle with a single system of resolution.<br/><br/>The Challenge is between two Creators, each with uniform tools at their disposal. Play is divided into two Phases: In Phase I, Creators alternate playing Tiled Cards to create a map, and use octagonal Origin Points to set where their Creations spawn from. In Phase II, Body &amp; Soul Cards are paired together to make 3 Creations per team. After their Creator describes them, pawns are placed on the map to represent them. As pawns are moved around the map, they will come into conflict with Rival Creations. Conflict is resolved by rolling 1 to 3 six-sided dice. A continually exchanged Event Card assigned to each Creation provides aid or presents challenges as the game unfolds, typically by modifying the number of dice rolled.<br/><br/>By rolling successfully, Creations will lose Heart. When Heart is reduced to zero, the Creations is removed from the map. Origin Points have no Heart and are removed from the map when rolled against successfully, but are much harder to succeed against. The game is over when one side has lost both Origin Points or all 3 Creations. That side loses.<br/><br/>",

The person who rolls highest goes first, followed by the person to their left and so on and so forth. Should two or more people roll the highest number than they must roll off until someone has rolled higher.<br/><br/>When it is your turn you must do the following.<br/>1.    Draw a card from the draw pile.<br/>2.    Use a power card, place a character card in play, or use a character card power.<br/>3.    Discard cards from your hand until you have only five left.<br/><br/>Power Cards<br/>Most power cards may only be used on your turn. When you play a power card you immediately do whatever it says, then discard it. Well&hellip; not immediately, but before you do anything else game related. So you could eat a sandwich or something.<br/><br/>Some power cards may be used at other times, which is indicated on the card itself. When in doubt, the card is right.<br/><br/>Character Cards<br/>Character cards may be placed in front of you during your turn instead of using a power card or a character power. Place the character card in front of you and leave it there until something tells you to place it someplace else. This is now considered to be an &ldquo;in play&rdquo; character card. You may not use the Character Card Power the turn you place a character card in play. You may only have three character cards in play at a time. If you place a fourth you must discard one.<br/><br/>Character Card Powers<br/>Instead of placing a character card or using a power card you may use the power on one of your &ldquo;in play&rdquo; character cards. This power works just like a power card, except you do not need to discard the character card to use it.<br/><br/>Note, some character cards have passive effects that do not require you to use them on your turn. These abilities are always in effect and should be easy to determine. If an argument does ensue the following characters have &ldquo;passive&rdquo; abilities.<br/><br/>Khan-El, Biel-Tel, Beorn, Penelope, Neil and Harris.<br/><br/>How to Win<br/>This is the part you have all been waiting for isn&rsquo;t it? To win the game all you have to do is have all of your in play character cards be the same characters as on your Dream Team card. Once you do that you win!<br/><br/>",

It's a family game designed for 2 to 6 players ages 12 and older.<br/><br/>To begin a round of Blankity-Blank!, you take a card from the box and let all the players see it. On the front of the card is an incomplete word with some letters left blank; for example, P--N-. You and every other player have three minutes to write down all the words you can think of that would complete that pattern, like phone or piano or plant or prank. When time is up you all read your lists aloud and cross out any word that more than one person wrote; you score points only for words that you alone thought of.<br/><br/>The front of the card indicates whether this is a 1-point, 2-point, or 3-point round, according to how many potential matches there are for this pattern. 1-point cards have dozens of possible solutions, 2-pointers not so many, and 3-point cards have the fewest of all. So you score 1, 2, or 3 points for each unique word in your list. (P--N- would be a 2-point card.)<br/><br/>When you've recorded the scores for this round, you may look at the back of the card. It shows a list of the most common words that would be correct solutions, so players can see some of the words no one thought of.<br/><br/>You continue to play with another card and another until one player has scored enough points to win. This can be 25 points, or 50, or any number the group agrees to.<br/><br/>The game includes over 500 cards, a pad of answer sheets, and a timer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Child Beauty Pageant Tycoon is a game where you and your friends take the role of a mother whose greatest goal in life is to have her children win Beauty Pageants.  The first player to win five Beauty Pageant crowns wins the game.  There are 4 very different ways to make your Child ready to compete in a Pageant.  1) Spending a night with a Stud to give your child an edge from the very start. 2) Gaining experience by simply competing in Pageants. 3) Training your Child in a special Skill. 4) Buying a special 1-use Item to be used in any Pageant.  Each Pageant will have different entry fees and winnings, and they will focus on different stats.  When a pageant focuses on a stat, it counts for double towards winning the pageant.  For example, let's say Mary Beth has a 'Smarts' score of 3. In the Pageant shown above, she will get to double her smarts score and it will instead give her 6 points toward winning the Pageant!  Glitz or Talent stats still count toward winning, but they aren't doubled in this Pageant.<br/><br/>",

This is mixed with some contextual statements like for example &quot;will the phone ring during the game session?&quot;. Though usually it's mostly a game of plain luck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Annihilation is a Battleship-style game for two players using pencil and paper.  Each player receives an identical printed sheet from a game pad, featuring a circular overhead map of the northern hemisphere.  The map is divided into boxes by longitudinal and latitudinal lines, which are labeled by numbers and by names of constellations.  Some boxes are shaded, representing the oceans.  Also present are boxes to track each player&rsquo;s hits; in place of ships are (in order of most to least boxes) Capital, Trade and Industry, Air Base, Navy, and Peace.  Each player &ldquo;hides&rdquo; each of these objectives on his own side of the map, vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.  The Navy must be in the ocean, Peace is a single box that may be anywhere, and the rest must be on land.<br/><br/>Each player then takes a turn firing volleys at the other side.  A volley consists of 15 bombs, which can be any combination of airplane bombs, rockets, or atomics.  Airplane bombs count for 1 bomb against the limit, rockets for 3, atomics for 5.  Volleys are done all at once, with the opponent not announcing hits until the volley is over.  Players track these developments by crossing off boxes on their paper.  When a player sends a volley, if he has previously received any hits, those hits are subtracted from the 15 bombs he may fire on his current turn.<br/><br/>Airplane bombs strike only the square called by the player, rockets strike the first square and any two adjoining squares called immediately by the player, and atomics strike the initial square as well as the four adjoining squares along all four sides.  Any target hit on one square by an atomic is immediately destroyed, any target hit by a rocket suffers an additional box hit after what the player targeted.  Should any player strike the target of Peace, the game is immediately over, otherwise the game is won when all of a player&rsquo;s other targets are destroyed.<br/><br/>",

Then the player tries to play a word of 3-5 letters, whose die faces match a contiguous subset of the dice on the board.  If they do, they score the sum of the cards' pips, doubled for 4-letter words and tripled for 5-letter words.  There are also wild cards, and slug cards that can be added at either end.<br/><br/>The winner is the first person to reach the specified total score, e.g. 100 for 4-5 players.<br/><br/>",

You can play any of the games with the same deck of cards!<br/><br/>One of the most fun and exciting games ever created is &ldquo;Battle of Words!&rdquo; It comes in &ldquo;quick start,&rdquo; &quot;basic,&quot; and &quot;advanced&quot; versions. The basic version can be mastered in a matter of minutes and is fun for the entire family. The play consists of forming words, lengthening existing words, combining words, and stealing words from your opponent(s). The advanced version is easy to learn but will stimulate and challenge even the most astute word gamers. In addition to the basic play, there are 20 action cards that create all kinds of excitement and dynamics between the players. In either version, each player competes for high score through word values, word length values, bonus letter values, bonus word values, other word bonuses, and the number / quality of words acquired by the end of the game.<br/><br/>You can also play the following;<br/>&ldquo;Cross Words&rdquo; - plays similar to a crossword puzzle game, without the limits of a regular game.<br/>&ldquo;Play On Words&rdquo; - plays similar to a 3-D crossword puzzle game, without standard limitations.<br/>&ldquo;Finding the Right Words&rdquo; - plays similar to a cubed word game, without the grid or cube.<br/>&ldquo;The Last Word&rdquo; - plays similar to a word jumble or word search, with strategy &amp; scoring options.<br/>&ldquo;Simple Words&rdquo; - plays similar to solitaire, but played with words and is more entertaining.<br/><br/>You can even play poker style games that involve many more strategies and scoring options, such as;<br/>&ldquo;Word For Word&rdquo; - plays similar to Texas Hold 'em.<br/>&ldquo;Keep Your Word&rdquo; - plays similar to 7-Card Stud.<br/>&ldquo;Choose Your Words&rdquo; - plays similar to 7-Card Draw.<br/>&ldquo;Hold Your Words&rdquo; - plays similar to 7-Card No Draw.<br/>&ldquo;A Few Words&rdquo; - plays similar to 7-Card No Peek.<br/><br/>In addition, you get &quot;Your Words, Not Mine&quot; which creates several more variations of game play, allowing you to play many of the games backwards! Rather than competing for high score, each player competes for low score by transferring their words / scores to other players.&quot;<br/><br/>The deck comes with 176 cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You play the part of a Fairy Lord, commanding one of the four armies of Fairy in an epic tournament.<br/><br/>For each tournament, four humans are 'invited' to join by the fairy lords. Often kidnapped or unwittingly stumbling into the Fairy land, these humans exemplify the fairy's love of fools and foolish people.<br/><br/>You can use your powers to change the outcome of each battle, but be wary! The nobility of Fairy are very honorable in nature and won&rsquo;t stand for such trickery! And watch out for the fools! They can ruin your whole battle.<br/><br/>Fools! is a simple card game, with one deck of 64 cards. Each player draws a small 'army' of 3 face down cards and a hand of three cards. The army cards represent those fairies who will distinguish themselves in battle. Your hand represents fairies and fools you can use to hinder your opponents or strengthen your own army.<br/><br/>Cards can be played as Standard Bearers, some with special effects. Players are then required to replace a card in their opponent's army with one from their hand. They may then replace a card in their own army with one from their hand. Through this all, their army cards remain hidden from everyone.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, your hand is discarded and your army cards (actually those who've distinguished themselves in this round of battle) are revealed. Points are added up and the highest score wins the turn.<br/><br/>2 player games play to 5 points, 3 players to 4 points and 4 players to three points.<br/><br/>This light card game is meant to fill the same roll as Zombie Dice - a fast, light and portable game to be played anywhere. Also great with kids.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fast-paced, multiplayer, strategy war game that utilizes custom dice. Assemble your army, build, develop, and conquer.<br/><br/>Welcome to the realm of Trilania, a world that has been ripped apart by magic in many ways...<br/>First, where once the planet was whole, a disruption in the balance of magic caused it to be divided into three layers: the Lowlands, which is the main land; the Midlands, and, suspended by magic above the Lowlands, the Highlands.<br/>Second, the land has been divided by war for over a century. Many of the Highland races believed their gods set them above the rest of the world, and it was their destiny to rule the lower races. Most of the Midlands strived for neutrality, seeking to open trade with the Highlands and the Lowlands. The Lowlands were divided into two main groups, those who sought only equality, and those who wanted to overthrow the Highland races. Some races, with the use of magic, altered themselves to resemble their animalistic gods, and the other races, realizing that this gave them physical and tactical advantages, followed suit. You must now choose which race or races you will command, lead them into battle, and form temporary alliances as you see fit. But choose your allies wisely and watch your back, because in the end, there can only be one victor. Always remember, the best laid strategy can sometimes go awry. Let the Dice Fly High!<br/><br/>Game-play is pretty simple. Choose the team of dice which is kind of like building a typical card deck, except with dice. Each dice costs a certain amount Team Points (TP). You have 140 TP to build your team.<br/><br/>A Teams consist of 2 types of dice Units and Buildings:<br/><br/>Units - units do not have a TP cost. Each unit is worth 'X'amount of Man Power (MP)'X' is equal to the units level. MP is used to build addition buildings and upgrades.<br/>Level 1 units: Tend to be your weaker men<br/>Level 2 units: Are stronger then level 1 units of course<br/><br/>Buildings <br/>War Camps: produce level 1 and 2 units<br/>Secondary Buildings: give you various advantages through upgrades and elite level units<br/><br/>Objective:  build units to destroy your opponents ability to produce troops.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>The The Quest for Piptwynn's Scroll is a tabletop miniatures game that pits two players against each other to obtain Piptwynn's Scroll, an artifact of great importance, that can be found on the top of Star Snag Crag. The object of the game is to reach the top of the Crag, retrieve the Scroll, and then make it off the Crag again. The game board is defined as a series 49 four inch squares arranged in four tiers. The top tier is the peak of Star Snag Crag.<br/><br/>Each player controls a team, or Quad, made up of 4 different specialists, selected from the 8 possible types listed in the game. Some types focus on mobility, others on combat, and some, like the Beastmastr [sic], level the playing field with unusual abilities. These character types also rely on items (magical &amp; non-magical) to give them an edge in certain situations.<br/><br/>Each turn the players perform game actions in a set order of phases: Activation, Movement, Exploration and Occurrences (weather effects or wandering monsters), Conflict Resolution, and Evening (a time of healing and recharging). Both players act simultaneously so occasionally members of one Quad will end up in conflict with each other quite by accident. Random game elements can also send creatures or primitives to attack members of a Quad. Terrain effects are randomly determined the first time the member of a Quad enters a new square. These effects can produce anything from a Refreshing Spring to a Dragon Nest.<br/><br/>Unlike most miniatures game, death isn't a feature of Piptwynn's Scroll. When one side wins a conflict, the other side is driven away. Since this is fundamentally a race to the peak of Star Snag Crag, getting pushed back on any given turn can make the difference between winning and losing. In this way the game is more family-friendly than the many miniatures games that focus on death and dismemberment.<br/><br/>The rulebook also contains several rules variants, including set up a larger board for tournament play. Also included are reproducible sheets, charts, tokens, etc., along with tips on how to paint miniatures and how to build a proper three-dimensional game board. (Players must provide their own miniatures, a playing surface--which can be simple map or more traditional war game terrain, and a set of polyhedral dice)<br/><br/>There were several planned follow-up games for this title, including an RPG crossover. None of them seem to have ever come to fruition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A rather complicated board for the age group that would normally enjoy a Noddy related game.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a character and the associated playing piece. There are 6 face-down counters and when you set off along the track you must take one. Turn it over and that tells you which present you are taking to Noddy's house (example present might be a cake).<br/><br/>The first track to move along is the red one. If you land on white numbered squares, they will help you. If you land on black numbered squares then that will be a hazard. However the game at this point is a little different to normal Goose-type games. When arriving on a hazard square, refer to the list in the rules. Hazards relate to the presents. So, if you were carrying the cake, then a hazard for any other present would not apply.<br/><br/>After reaching the end of the red track, you start moving along the letters that spell Noddy (located in the centre of the board). You must reach the end of the fifth letter Y and then set off on the return journey which will end on the letter N.<br/><br/>Finally you move a long the white circles to Noddy's house. However, on this path there are three circles that feature two colours. If you land on one of these and your counter is one of these two colours, then you have to wait until the player with other colour reaches this circle. That wait could be a long one which might well bore the player affected. I guess the designer wanted to make a game that allowed the back-markers to catch up, which is fair enough.<br/><br/>The winner is the first to arrive at Noddy's house.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game board represents a honeycomb in the bee hive. The queen rests in the middle of the brood nest (brown cells) surrounded by her royal household. The colored cells above the brood nest show stored pollen (inside the pollen field there are yellow and brown pollen cells).<br/>Yet above the pollen field the honey cells are located (yellow cells). The honeycomb is occupied by the queen and several workers and drones. The smallest bees are workers.<br/><br/>In Das Bienenspiel players try to get 3 cards of honey and 3 cards of pollen. This is achieved by reaching either honey or pollen cells and claiming one. After each claim the player pawn has to return to the central brood nest unless he is able to hit a spot with a drone which allows the player to immediately turn around and go for another card.<br/><br/>Players have to move the full roll amount and must not enter cells which are occupied by bees or other player pawns.<br/>Player with the full set of 6 cards (3+3) need to return to the queen cell to win the game.<br/><br/>",

Each wizard will then select a card from his or her deck and reveal them dramatically at the same time.<br/><br/>A Bolt is a quick spell that strikes first to defeat the more complex Blast.<br/>A Blast effects a large area and will easily circumvent a Shield<br/>A Shield spell creates a wall of force that can ward off any Bolt.<br/><br/>The wizard with the victorious spell is... victorious! If wizards cast the same spell, they strike each other in an explosion that would easily deplete any special effects budget. The wizards then pick a new spell and the duel continues until one is defeated.<br/><br/>The triumphant wizard claims all cards his or her opponent used in the duel. After Pax, the points are tallied and one school is crowned champion!<br/><br/>",

The game starts with the tile number 1 and based on the description tile number 2 needs to be found and so on.<br/>The game can be played solo or in large groups (e.g. Italian classes).<br/><br/>",

Depending on when you activate the Rider, the Pale Rider can be a hard-hitting ranged attacker or a fairly resilient and fast (if expensive) objective-grabber.<br/><br/>Like the other Riders, the Pale Rider is fairly fragile for its cost, and likely to be destroyed quickly if directly targeted. However, the Rider is full of tricks and options to keep that from happening. Also like all the Riders, the Pale Rider has a complex adjustable Ability that you can use to give the Pale Rider different abilities depending on your need.<br/><br/>The Pale Rider is a Guild model and offers a lot of mobility to the usually-slow Guild, but it also has significant synergy with Leveticus. You're most likely to see the Pale Rider with either C. Hoffman or Leveticus.<br/><br/>C. Hoffman can benefit from the Pale Rider's fast movement with his Drawn to Metal ability, and can boost the Pale Rider with healing, Reactivations, or just using its attacks with Machine Puppet. The Pale Rider is one of the three most likely models for carrying Hoffman around (alongside the Peacemaker and the Mechanical Rider.)<br/><br/>Leveticus doesn't have a lot of synergy with the Pale Rider as a Master, but the Pale Rider usually operates solo anyway, and Avatar Leveticus gets significant benefit from having the Pale Rider in play. Avatar Leveticus can also summon the Pale Rider after Manifesting.<br/><br/>Other Guild Masters may benefit from the Pale Rider's speed, since many Guild models are quite slow.<br/><br/>",

You never know what will come up, just like in real life &ldquo;on the beat&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Players start with five cards in their hand.  During game play, you have numerous different actions to choose from on your turn.

Solving or rather &quot;resolving&quot; calls for service results in points, depending on the difficulty of the call for service and the number/types of cops required.  The winner is the first one to acquire 50 points worth of solved calls for service.  The trick to that is you want to make sure you don't have a lot of unresolved calls in front of you because they count against your final score at the end!<br/><br/>The game incorporates dice as well for &quot;shootout&quot; cards.  A simple mechanic in which the bad guys hit on a roll of &quot;6&quot; and the cop(s) hit on a &quot;5&quot; or &quot;6&quot;.

        "description": "BattleAxe<br/>by Nick Ryan<br/><br/>BattleAxe is an dark age battlefield warefare simulation tabletop game for 2 players (or 2 teams) that allows the players to use their strategic skills against each others armies. The main goal is to kill the opponent's King. Each army consists of 26 numbered men, 2 warhorses. Your army including axe-men, spearmen, swordsmen, archers, an engineer, horsemen and 1 king, all with different and balanced attributes. The fighting/attacking mechanism is an elegant 1 to 3 custom dice rolling system. Each player has the exact same army, similar to Chess, as to see which player really has superior strategic skills. Asymmetrical games can also be played with endless scenarios.<br/><br/>Each player has an &quot;Army Map&quot; sheet for his army which illustrates and keeps track of each warrior and warhorse. Each man in your army has his own health meter, skills, attributes, and even a place for the player to name them. This gives an unparalleled  up-close-and-personal view from the battlefield. Engineers are a big part of the game, they can cut down trees, construct archer towers to enhance their attack range, walls, fire trenches and even make extra arrows for your archers. The concept of fire, from fire arrows and fire trenches symbolized by &quot;wild fire&quot; tiles are also a big part of the game. Fire can spread and take down your walls and towers which creates a real feel of the chaos of war.<br/><br/>It's who the better strategic commander is, not who can level up faster with fairy dust and gold coins.<br/>It's dividing and concurring enraged enemy forces, not gathering grain for the winter.<br/>It's swiftly destroying the opposing King and all his men to become the one true King of the battlefield.<br/>It's BattleAxe.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Iron-Core is primarily as a vehicle vs. vehicle combat system. Although infantry play an important role, they are not the primary focus of the game. A typical game will consist of one to five armored vehicles and, three to seven squads of infantry or support units.<br/><br/>The game is designed to play like a WWII simulation. Every effort was taken to use and distill actual WWII vehicle and combat data in the creation of the vehicle stats and game play. Unlike modern warfare, not every shot will hit its target and many hits will not penetrate your opponent&rsquo;s armor and result in an instant kill. Two evenly matched vehicles may find themselves in an extended engagement, trading shot for shot until one finds a soft spot and makes the kill.<br/><br/>The decision to base the play style and game mechanics on a more antiquated technology was a conscious one, born from the desire to add more depth to the combat than a simple &ldquo;Roll D6, four or better, you kill your target&rdquo;. Vehicles, regardless of the manufacturer represent more of a financial investment than infantry units do. With this in mind, the number of large units required to play Iron-Core have been reduced as the vehicle and infantry survivability has been extended to a more descriptive and cinematic feel.<br/><br/>Our goal is to provide a game system that rewards tactics and punishes suicide runs. Applying bonuses and penalties based on unit position, unit formations, moral, and support fire and tactics; you will find that an inferior force can defeat a superior force with the application of some tactical forethought. Many of optional rules may slow play but highly recommended.<br/><br/>There are many game systems available, each have their own strengths, weaknesses and focus. If you are looking for a brigade level combat game, Iron-Core may not be the best choice. If you want a dynamic vehicle vs. vehicle combat system where having the biggest and the best does not equate to an &ldquo;I win&rdquo; button, then Iron-Core may be the game for you.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mages in the Marketplace is a highly interactive deck-building game where each player takes on the role of one of four mages. Each mage may also select one of four familiars, minor elementals that grow in power as they are fed magic. These mages are vying to become the richest and most famous, each for their own individual reasons.<br/><br/>The twist: Players take their turns simultaneously, and when it is time to decide which card they would like to purchase from the center, all mages hide their selection, revealing them together. Any player who is alone purchases their card without worry, but any time multiple players wish to purchase the same card, a duel takes place between their familiars. The crowd cheers for the winner, who then purchases that card, whereas the losing familiar becomes hurt and its master must find a new card to purchase.<br/><br/>The mages include:<br/>The Magician: a master of showmanship. He uses impressive magic to generate extra Fame.<br/>The Seer: a mage with the ability to see into the future. She can influence what order she draws her spells in.<br/>The Sorcerer: a chaotic mage with little control, and less desire for it. His unpredictable nature makes him difficult to defeat in battle.<br/>The Wizard: an old academic with a deep understanding of magic itself. His mana generation is second to none.<br/><br/>The familiars come in four basic flavours, Air, Earth, Fire, and Water, and as one feeds their Elemental they may blend them together into more complicated beasts - by combining Fire and Water, for example, one may create a Steam Elemental. All combinations are represented, including the all-powerful Omni Elemental!<br/><br/>Note: &quot;Mages in the Marketplace&quot; is a working title.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kipling (the Seemingly Saying Something Game) is a card/token voting game exploring themes of complex communication &ndash; saying one thing, but meaning another &ndash; for 2 to 8 players, ages 11 and over. The game is based Kipling&rsquo;s six questions, in our case ordered as Why, What, How, for the intent and (in no particular order) Where, When and Who for the content.<br/><br/>On each turn, one player is the Speaker, who is randomly dealt a Why, a What and a How card, which can be Good, Neutral or Bad. From these, the Speaker makes up a sentence and says it to the player on their left, the Spoken To, in the style required by the cards without showing the cards to the other players.<br/><br/>Each other player then votes on each of the three categories, Why/What/How and chooses Good/Neutral/Bad, in clockwise order starting with the Spoken To player. During and before this phase the Speaker and Spoken To can play Jokers to double or redouble the score for that round if they choose to. Once votes are in, the Speaker reveals the cards they were dealt, and the scores are calculated; one point for each correct guess, with the potential for an extra point for the Spoken To each turn, because they will have an extra token for voting.<br/><br/>If nobody or everybody finds the correct combination of three intent cards, the storyteller scores 0, and each of the other players scores 1 point for each individual part they got correct. Otherwise the storyteller shares the same score as whoever found the complete answer; usually a score 3 or 4. Jokers might double this to up to 4 or 8 depending on cards in play and who was the correct player.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player scores 16 or more points, but this threshold should be increased for larger numbers of players. In either case, the player with the most points wins the game. If there is a draw, the player who spoke most is the winner.<br/><br/>",

When he goes to walk home, he finds himself in a hallucinated alcoholic wonderland!  <br/>     The objective in this game is to be the first one to get Squirrel home. Sounds easy enough, but the twisted trail loaded with booby traps and treasures, along with the drinking challenge, creates a great board game for all drinking game fans.<br/>     First pick a starter. The game comes with some creative ideas for this. Then everybody rolls one dice and moves along the trail accordingly. The trail is filled with short cuts filled with Jail spots. When a player lands in Jail, they must finish their drink before returning to gameplay. On the main yellow trail, players are likely to land on the Golden Acorns. Landing here means the player gets bonus turns by guessing high, low, odd, or even, based on their previous roll, and they keep going untill they guess wrong. Simply follow the yellow trail and everybody will make it to the finish, but the twisted trail makes this an interesting tricky challenge. Luckily the game comes with a map that will show you the way. The game also comes with sober cab rules so everybody can play. If you are a power hour fan, you will definately like the drinking challenge built into this game. The challenge is that every time you land on a &quot;D&quot; Spot, you must take the number of drinks that you rolled to get there. Over all, This is a unique and simple drinking board game that anyone over 21 can easily learn, and start the challenge of being the first player to get Squirrel home alive.<br/><br/>",

Factories are built, upgraded and close down, workers are hired and replaced by machines as players try to maximize their profits observing the environment and the competitors.<br/><br/>This whole process is embodied into a dynamic economic environment. Cities develop as population migrates, new industries are built, closed or relocated, wages are increased and resources/materials prices fluctuate. Development brings higher demand, which players try to control through advertising.<br/>Players also need to manage the transportation circuit and either invest now for future payoffs (opponents pay more to the owner of a route and the latter earns money when population migrates through his network) or try to handle the long-term costs. <br/>Contracts which will be available each round, will inject players with critical cash (as there are no loans) but ending unfulfilled they will incur penalties.<br/><br/>For 2 players (and the solo) there is also an automated player who exploits opportunities and antagonizes the players without being complicated.<br/><br/>The game ends after the round when either all spaces have been built or one player has built all his factories (for the one and two players additional conditions for the automated player may also end the game).<br/>At the end, each player's efficiency will be calculated as a percentage between 0 and 100, taking into account a number of parameters such as cash, sales, production lines, etc.A hidden card, dealt randomly to each player from the beginning, will solve ties.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "'Look and Learn' (English name) is designed to stimulate a child's ability to &quot;discriminate between objects, to compare them, to grasp relationships between them, and to sort according to common characteristics.&quot; (From the box bottom.)<br/><br/>Up to seven different games are possible using the multi-picture boards and picture tiles included. Three of them are described here:<br/><br/>1. Picture lotto<br/>Each player gets a player board. Boards that aren't needed and the corresponding tiles are removed from the game. The remaining tiles are shuffled and placed on the table, colour side up. The game master picks up one tile after the other, shows the picture and names the pictured object. The player whose board contains the same picture calls out, gets the tile and places it on his/her board. The first player to have covered all the images on his/her board wins the game.<br/><br/>2. Picture quiz<br/>The game master shows a picture without naming it. The player who has the picture on his/her board calls out, but they only get the tile if they can name the object. The opposite way is possible too: The game master doesn't show the picture but names the object shown on the tile. The player who finds the picture on his/her board gets the tile. The first player to have covered all the images on his/her board wins the game.<br/><br/>3. Memory lotto<br/>Each player gets a board. He/she gets 30 seconds to memorise the images. Then the player boards are placed on the table, face down. The game master picks up one tile after the other and shows the image or names the object. The player who thinks the image is on his/her own player board calls out. The tile is placed face up next to the player board. If two players call out simultaneously, the game master puts the tile at the bottom of his/her stack. If an image isn't claimed by any of the players, the tile is removed from the game. When the game master has used all the tiles, the players reveal their boards. For each matching tile, they get two points; for each incorrect or missing one, one point is subtracted. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>More game variations are possible using the different colors on the backs of the picture tiles and multi-picture boards.<br/><br/>The box indicates that it was &quot;Made in Western-Germany&quot;.<br/><br/>",

This is followed by choice of a variety of dice movement strategies, in order to arrive back at GO! with exactly $200 (no more, no less).<br/><br/>During movement, if two players arrive at the same square a variant of SNAP (The BANCE! action) allows for players to steal one another's money.

        "description": "The airship marked a turning point in society. Now the skies were open to exploration, commerce, and illegal activity. The clouds became hiding places for Speakeasies, black market dealers, and much more unsavory activities. As a result, the Sky Patrol was created to help keep the peace. In an attempt to avoid being arrested during a recent &ldquo;job&rdquo;, you have accidentally wrecked your airship along with a few unlucky others. Fix your airship as quickly as possible to avoid certain incarceration!<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll dice trying to match them to a type of component (using simple icons). Once you know what it looks like, you search for a token that has the same icons, trying to recover a piece of your airship. Once recovered, airship components grant special abilities like making your turns easier or even griefing opponents.<br/><br/>Not all the tokens are useful. Most of the time, the player will select a token that is of no use to them and place it back in the pile. Memorization skills are necessary to ensure a player doesn't needless pick up the same token again and to remember where opponents have placed tokens the player needs. But with the special abilities that can be earned, the tokens can be shifted multiple times per game.<br/><br/>The first player to collect all of their tokens to complete their airship wins the game.<br/><br/>",

However, a racy little shark has suddenly appeared and is circling this group of playmates. Luckily the squid is able to spread lots of ink ! Now we need your help ! Come and play together and help save the squid and its friends by covering the shark in so much ink, that it can't see properly. Because a shark that dissapears in a 'soup of ink' cannot be dangerous anymore ! The excitement begins: Is the shark going to eat up 9 little fishes first ?

        "description": "-Seize them! ...said the King.<br/>My chambers were robbed!! <br/>Those bandits took my treasures and they are escaping through the castle!<br/><br/>In Rogue you own one of the four thieves groups: Cult of Masks, Sentinels, Fox Guild, Narrow Path Clan and your purpose is to become the Master Rogue by leading your group to have the more Victory Points at the end of the game. To do that you must collect the most Treasure tokens. Each player owns 11 cards, 4 Master Thieves, 6 Gambits and 1 Black Market card (score card which gives you points depending on the treasure you have collected).<br/><br/>Each player chooses 1 Master Thief and 3 Gambits to begin the game and places the chosen cards face down on the table in an accessible (by all the players) area. All these cards form a mini deck of 16 cards. You never shuffle the deck. Now you cut the deck 3 times (one time each player) and the last player takes the deck, deals the cards on the table (4 rows x 4 cards each row, from the top left to the bottom right) and plays first. In each round, the player can do one of the following actions:Reveal a hidden card or to Exchange one of the cards in his/her hand, with a hidden card on the table. In that case the player who chooses the 2nd action, must place his new card faced up but note that this action costs you -1 Victory Point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The Gambit cards have 2 different colored dice from the four colors you will find in the game (red, blue, green, yellow). When a Gambit card is revealed and in the same column (vertically) there is another Gambit, a Dispute takes place between the two. The players who own these Gambits, roll the corresponding dice and the one with the most hits takes a Treasure token. The Treasure tokens are faced down aside and when a dispute is commencing, you take one such token in random and place it on the Gambit cards, revealing the Treasure (the cards have been designed specifically for this purpose). In case of a tied dispute, the Treasure is lost (the King's guardians snatch it as your thieves flea to take cover). In case the 2 Gambits belong to the same thieves group, no dispute takes place as they work together to get the treasure. The player who owns them, takes a Treasure token immediately!<br/><br/>Each colored die represents a basic element: blue for Aqua, red for Ignis, green for Terra, yellow for Aura. The Master Thieve cards have those elements. The Master Thieves give additional skills to the Gambits when a Dispute takes place. For example when you roll a Red and a Green die for your Gambit and there is a faced up Master Thief on the table (your or your rivals') which represents Terra (green die), you add +1 Hit to the final result! Yet nothing is over. The Black Market cards have 4 different combinations of the Treasures, different for each player which grant him Victory Points, depending on the combination. But don't be so sure you can win the game since the Master Thieves can steal the Treasures from each other with a very tricky mechanic you will discover in the game. Beware.. If your Master Thief loses his Treasures, then you must place him sideways to deactivate his ability to steal, so you must place a new Master Thief to get revenge! Prepare yourself for the faster course of your life as no one knows of his victory, until the last card on the table is revealed!<br/><br/>A race begins...<br/><br/> A Thieves' Race!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Food for thought is a nutrition themed board game. The emphasis is on eating a balanced diet exemplified by 6 food attributes of Fat, Carbohydrates, Fiber, Vitamins, Minerals and Calories. It is part chance (dice) and part strategy (players decide whether or not to 'eat' the food card they land on) based. The theme in general is also to introduce younger players to the above mentioned food attributes and make them more informed about nutrition.<br/><br/>The players start off with all food attributes on the 'good' row of the 'nutritional grid'. Depending on the food choices they make, their counters move up or down the grid until one of the food attribute counters reaches the &quot;lose a life&quot; row, at which point they lose a life. Players can also un-balance other players nutrition grids via the &quot;Payback time&quot;, &quot;switch identity&quot; and &quot;Chance&quot; events. Interspersed with the food cards are &quot;exercise&quot;, &quot;catch some rays&quot;, &quot;water&quot; and &quot;regular doctor's visit&quot;c cards that teach the importance of these attributes.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to stay alive (by not having any counter reach the &quot;lose a life&quot; row on the nutritional grid) by 'eating' the 'right' (balanced) foods. Another goal also is to make your opponents die by making them eat the 'wrong' foods as a result of a &quot;chance&quot;, &quot;payback time&quot; or &quot;switch identity&quot; event. The player who is the last to stay alive wins the game.<br/><br/>Please visit <a target='_blank' href=\"http://foodforthoughtgame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://foodforthoughtgame.com</a> for a complete description of the game as well as a picture of the actual game board.<br/><br/>",

Use four cubes, meeples, or pawns in four colors ( Red-Blue-Green-Yellow ) these are pedestrians and are placed on the number 1 slot on the crosswalk at the start of game.<br/><br/>The Deal<br/><br/>Shuffle the deck.<br/><br/>With 2-4 players you deal five cards one at a time to each player face down, the rest of the deck is placed face down as stock. As the game progresses players may be dealt less cards.<br/><br/>The Play<br/>Players then look over their hand, any cards not belonging to their suit are discarded face down next to the stock making a discard pile.<br/><br/>Any players not having at least one card in their suit must discard their whole hand face down to the discard pile and re-dealt five cards.<br/><br/>Each player chooses a card from his hand and places it face down before him. After all cards are down, they are turned over simultaneously.<br/><br/>This is called a match and the winner of the match is determined by who has the higher rank.<br/><br/>The player with the highest ranking card moves his pawn in his suit color to the corresponding number on the crosswalk.<br/><br/>The other players then compare their rank values with the lead players rank, the difference between them, is where the other players move their pawns to.<br/><br/>Example: The lead card is Red-7 the other players cards are Green-6, Blue-4, Yellow-4. Now the difference between Green-6 and Red-7 is 1, so the green pawn is moved to the #1 spot. The difference between Blue-4 and Yellow-4 to Red-7 is 3 so the Blue and Yellow pawn are moved to the #3 spot.<br/><br/>Players then play all remaining cards in their hands in the same manner, any players left with cards after one of the other players have none, must discard their remaining hand to the discard pile face down.<br/><br/>Now you return to The Deal, when the stock is empty the discard pile is made into the new stock.<br/><br/>The game stops when the stock and discard pile are empty then you score the round.<br/><br/>The Score<br/>The game is played in 3 rounds.<br/><br/>The numbers on the crosswalk are also the scoring track, so (1=10) (2=20) (3=30) (4=40) (5=50) (6=60) (7=70) (8=80) (9=90) (10=100)<br/><br/>The number on the crosswalk that your pawn is on after the game stops is your score for that round.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score after 3 rounds is declared the winner.<br/><br/>A two player game<br/><br/>All the rules are the same as in a four player game except as follows.<br/><br/>At the start of a two player game, players decide which two of the four color suits they are going to play and which two corresponding pawns are theirs to move and to score with. Use the higher score out of the two pawns at the end of each round.<br/><br/>A three player game<br/><br/>From the deck decide which suit of the four color suits to discard, also discard the pawn of that corresponding suit color, these cards and pawn are not to be used in the game. You should now have a deck of 30 cards in three suits and three pawns to play with. From this point on, all the rules are the same as in a four player game.<br/><br/>",

Each also has four divots labeled with place values like &quot;ones&quot;, &quot;millions&quot; and &quot;hundredths&quot;.  The color-coordinated Bingo cards have numbers on them where the four relevant digits are colored in a matching set of colors.  At the start of each round, someone shakes the shaker until the four balls settled into the four divots.  Players then evaluate the nine numbers on their game boards for digits that match the place value/marble color pairs, placing a chip on a match.  The first player to place three chips in a row wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1930s German game is a spin-and-move tour around Europe. There is a spinner in each corner of the board, and the four cute cars provided are in nicely painted ceramic: a very unusual feature in an era of typically metal or wooden pieces.<br/><br/>Each player starts and finishes in Berlin, and may travel either clockwise or counterclockwise. Players must follow directions in the rules if they land on one of Europe's 12 major cities, some good and some bad. In surely unintentional pre-WWII irony, the trip from Berlin goes no further east than Stalingrad, where the directions say the driver &quot;decides to stay a few days in the city of Tractor Works&quot;, and loses two turns.<br/><br/>",

The rules are inside the lid.<br/><br/>This Game is played on the floor or table, one player undertaking the defence and the other, (or others), the attack.<br/>Stand the Fort up. The towers will hinge into position. Then there are numerous instructions to complete the fort and that depended on how much you paid for the game. If you didn't have all the items mentioned in the instructions, then you had to make do. Chad Valley obviously made several editions of this game. Finally, the 15 discs are laid out as instructed. These represent trenches.<br/><br/>The defender places his Cannon, (provided in the betier editions), at one side of the Fort, and the attackers then send one man to the first Disc (or Trench), that is,thee the two furthest from the Fort; the defender then endeavours to shoot this man, and should he miss, the attacker may then move forward to the next Trench, or bring np another man as he considers best, when the defender again fires, and so on in turn, the object of the attacker, (or storming party), being to occupy the three Trenches nearest the Fort, each with one man, and if successful in this the attackers are then said to &ldquo;charge&rdquo; and the Fort is taken. If, however, the defence kill sufficient numbers of the attackers to prevent the three front Trenches being occupied, he has repulsed the assault and wins the game.<br/><br/>Soldiers having reached the front trench cannot be fired<br/>at. Should the defender exhaust his supply of ammunition he must miss one shot while a fresh supply is obtained.<br/><br/>",

Ship scale is 1:1200, although the rules may be modified for other scales. Measurements are in mm. Time scale is 1 move=1 minute.<br/><br/>There are data for a number of different types of ships ranging from frigates to the vaunted ships-of-the-line. Players use scale models to recreate historical or hypothetical naval engagements. The concise rules cover wind direction, movement, and gunnery. Dice rolls are used to generate random amounts of damage and gunfire accuracy.<br/><br/>These rules were published by Navwar in the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A tactical football game. Saturday afternoon football without the Sunday morning aches, bruises and sore muscles. Ther are no punts, your team has four downs to score. The team scoring five touchdaowns first wins. Clipping and downfield blocks are encouraged.<br/><br/>The counters represent individual players on each team. Players are rated for strength, speed, receiving and passing ability. Before the game starts, players &quot;draft&quot; a team from the available counters.<br/><br/>A ball counter is used and is possessed by the ball carrier. Offense lines up first with all players at or behind the line of scrimmage. Defens then lines up on the other side of the line of scrimmage.<br/><br/>The play starts when the center snaps the ball to the quarterback. To keep control of the game, only five of the offense's players will move to be followed by five of the defense's players. This allows players to set up blocks and maneuver around to gain a positional advantage. The remainder of each team moves next. Passes, laterals or handoffs are attempted in the second move action. A die roll determines if a pass is completed based on the pass distance and the passer's passing ability. Incomplete passes end the play. Receivers catching the ball use their speed to run for as much yardage as possible and defensive players attempt to minimize the yardage gained by tackling the receiver.<br/><br/>There are no set plays drawn up in the rules, so players draw up their own plays in the dirt by using a stick (not really, but that's how you should approach the game).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;This game was designed to be fun, but also to teach important principles about Christian Stewardship. The game emphasizes that being a good steward is a way of life, and that it is about the daily decisions we make in the use of out time, talent and treasure.&quot; (From the teacher's packet included with the game.)<br/><br/>Players roll a die to move around the board, reading aloud from one of four types of cards that match the square they landed on, then acting out what the card says to do. If the player lands on a &quot;Word on Stewardship&quot; space, they draw a card from that stack and have thirty seconds to look up the Bible verse listed on it. (Bible and timer are NOT included in the game pieces.) If the player cannot find the verse in time, they move backwards on the board. If they do find the verse, play halts until the player reads the verse aloud.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player lands on the &quot;Well done good and Faithful Steward&quot; by exact roll. This person is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Steel Towers is a game of city building, monster attacks, and high profits! After years of relentless attacks by aliens, gorillas, and monsters, Scraper City has finally banished these nuisances to a holding facility in the next state, where they are controlled by electronic collars. Downtown is ready to grow again! As real estate moguls in this once-again booming city, players compete to make the most money by building Skyscrapers to attract rent-paying tenants.<br/><br/>However, the Skyscrapers that make the most money are in the best Neighborhoods. Players hold cards which give them the right to build Skyscrapers along specific streets, while attracting valuable Businesses, knocking down unsightly Abandoned Buildings, and cleaning up Junkyards. However, the moguls try to foil each other by taking control of Mutant Monsters, Giant Gorillas, or Alien Attacks, making construction in Scraper City perilous at best.<br/><br/>The novel game mechanic for determining revenue from Skyscrapers at the end of each turn means that the most thoughtful strategy will prevail! The winning mogul is the one with the most money after ten years (turns) of building and collecting rent. Steel Towers is a unique game with easy-to-learn rules, but deep strategy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Passport Instructions to the &quot;Original&quot; World Rummy by Adell:<br/><br/>&quot;Original&quot; World Rummy is a game designed to combine the timeless appeal of playing cards with the impact of Backgammon and the strategy of chess.<br/><br/>Instructions are printed in 26 languages for the enjoyment of your family and friends around the world. Besides the languages listed in this entry, the rules are also printed in Farsi (Persian) and Swahili.<br/><br/>There are 106 tiles (each measuring 27 mm x 33 mm) used in the game. There are 2 jokers and 104 numbered tiles. The numbered tiles are in four colors: Black, Red, Blue and Yellow. Think of these as card suits. Each color consists of 13 &quot;ranks&quot; (numbered 1 to 13) and there are 2 sets of 1-13 in each color.<br/><br/>The tiles are mixed up and placed face down in the middle of the table. Each player draws one and the player drawing the lowest number goes first. 14 tiles are drawn by each player into their rack.<br/><br/>Objective: The first player to play out all their tiles in their rack wins the hand. The winner scores the tile points that are left in their opponent's racks. First player to get 500 points is the winner.<br/><br/>A player's turn begins with drawing a tile. Players lay down melds of 3 or more tiles (&quot;sets&quot; of the same rank or &quot;runs&quot; (consecutive ranks in the same color)). Once each player has laid down 1 meld, they can play on the melds of other players. If the player can't play on their own or another person's meld, they must pass. There's a sand timer, so player's lose their turn if they spend too much time analyzing their options.<br/><br/>Splitting runs and sets:<br/>As an example, if you have a Black 7 tile, you can split a Black run 9-8-7-6-5 into 2 runs - Black 5-6-7 and Black 7-8-9. If you have a Red 8-9, you can split 4-10's (Red, Black, Blue, Blue) into run Red 8-9-10 and set of 3-10's (Black, Blue, Blue).<br/><br/>The Jokers have some restrictions on their use, but they can be powerful options for a player's strategies. If you have the right tile, you can play it to replace a Joker, but then you must play the Joker right away; you cannot place it back in your rack.<br/><br/>Besides the tiles, the game comes with 4 tile racks (some assembly required) and 2 sand timers.<br/><br/>",

The platform and galleries (except for the center gallery tile) are set up randomly each game.<br/><br/>Players start the game with 12 action points to use for movement and relocating tiles.

        "description": "Guilds of Florence is a worker programming game where every player represents a clan of humble origin that is putting all their savings into improving the status of the clan. In order to do this, they will send their brightest sons as apprentices to some of the guilds of the city in seek of fame and fortune. To facilitate this, they will also marry some of their prettiest daughters to influential members of society in order to gain access to their exclusive guilds.<br/><br/>Game flow:<br/>1. Coming of age: each clan adds a son ready to work and a daughter ready to marry to their resource pool.<br/><br/>2. Getting a job: each clan sends as many sons from the resource pool to find a job as apprentices as they want and can afford. To get a job as an apprentice, you must have influence in that guild, there must be an available apprentice slot (only one per guild every turn) and you must have enough money to pay the admission fee.<br/><br/>Other ways of getting influence in otherwise inaccessible guilds, is by marrying your daughters to one of the meeples already in that guild. By doing so you gain access to that guild as long as that daughter lives or if you have already sons working in that guild.<br/>Some guilds can only be accessed by bribing the master a fixed amount of money.<br/><br/>3. Wedding day: each clan marries as many daughters from the resource pool as they want and can afford. To marry your daughters you need to pay the dowry to the lucky husband-to-be.<br/>When choosing which husband in a guild you would like to marry, your clan needs to have someone (son or daughter) in a guild of the same class as the target one. For example, someone in a minor guild, can only marry someone in a minor guild, whereas someone in a major guild can marry anyone.<br/><br/>4. Pay day: in this phase salaries get paid, products get made and products get exchanged for money.<br/><br/>5. Time goes by: apprentices may become journeymen. Journeymen may become masters or keep improving their skills and maybe get a higher wage. Masters may improve their mastery and gain increased reputation and produce more products. Masters that  reached the highest in their career, when time goes by, will sadly pass away. Same applies to their wives, who will also suffer the same fate.<br/><br/>6. Going to the market: each player buys as many products as they want and can afford. They can also exchange certain products for different products as a barter according to the market table. They CANNOT sell products for money; only masters can sell their own products for money.<br/><br/>7. Adjusting turn order:  in turn order, and one at a time, players may exchange sets of products for licences (VP). Move the VP tracker for those players accordingly. Once all players have passed in sequence, the new starting player will be the one with the most VP at this point in time.<br/><br/>End of the game and scoring<br/>The game ends when all players run out of meeples as they have all passed away.<br/>The game also ends immediately if after one full turn, none of the guilds have any meeple on them but there are meeples in the clan or resource pools.<br/>The winner is the player with most Victory Points.<br/><br/>",

The board consists of a map of the 23 areas, the starting area outside the Cimarron Strip, and paths connecting everything. Each area has one red space that the players must land on to claim the area.

Starting from your hut in the wild, your branch out to new frontiers as winter comes along and you need to gather resources in order to survive. But beware, in the vast forests of the realm dark and vicious creatures hide in the shadows.<br/><br/>Select from various scenarios ranging from simple hunts in the wilderlands to defending your home from the forces of the necromancer Yrmgor. No session will be like the other, as the modular gaming board is randomised before each game.<br/><br/>In Lowlander you can take a job in the village, go mining in the mountains, engage in skirmishes with the local fauna or simply collect wood for the winter. As rounds progress, you will move the game's clock, altering it from day to night time, which will impact your encounters in the wild, for it is safer to travel by day.<br/><br/>Lowlander is intended as a budget-game with a rich gaming experience for the true board game enthusiast who needs a solitaire fix and will be released by Q3 2013.<br/><br/>",

Make your pairs the quickest and win!<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose to draw cards from the deck or take the discard pile, make pairs, discard and pass the turn. Each vehicle  appears on three different cards. Each card has two different AFVs.

        "description": "Main idea:<br/>An educational game aimed at teaching/practising the relation between sounds and their written representation in the form of letters. Many primary school children have a hard time differentiating similar sounds, such as German &ouml; - eu - ei. The game is meant to help them by making them listen closely.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/>Basic game: Each player gets 6 picture cards and puts them in front of him/herself, face up. The remaining picture cards form a face-down stack at the center of the table. The stack with the 24 face-down letter cards is given to the game master, oldest player, or is passed from one player to the next each turn.<br/>The game master (or one of the players) looks at the top letter card and reads the sound. Each player can now discard one of their picture cards if it matches the sound from the letter card. For example, if the letter card is &quot;SCH&quot;, the picture cards showing a key, (&quot;Schl&uuml;ssel&quot;), pig (&quot;Schwein&quot;) or frog (&quot;Frosch&quot;) can be discarded. A player who doesn't have a matching card has to draw one from the draw deck. If the drawn card matches, he/she may discard it immediately.<br/>The first player to get rid of all his/her cards wins the game.<br/><br/>The &quot;expert&quot; variant: Each player gets 8 cards and may discard as many matching cards as they can when it is their turn (rather than just one picture card per sound card).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wealthy individuals on the Earth funded a project and have assembled the tools and mining teams capable of a 1 year expedition to a Near-Earth asteroid and have placed you in charge of its operation.  The mission is not without risk however.  In an effort to achieve the greatest resource achievement and make more room for hauling resources back to the Earth, the teams have been supplied with limited water and must learn to &ldquo;live off the land&rdquo; by locating sources of water to sustain themselves all the while avoiding the numerous other dangers of mining an asteroid such as outgassing and related geological effects. You and your team will be pitted against other mining teams with the same capabilities and it will be up to you to outperform the other teams to achieve the largest, most diverse haul and achieve victory.  Good Luck!<br/><br/>AIDLER-14 pits players in a unique mining mission where the ultimate goal is to acquire the greatest amount of resources, making the most efficient use of available mining tools and techniques that are available through the use of the mining assistance cards.  Abilities range from advanced movements on the asteroid surface to being able to double and even triple your teams mining production for the turn.  Your mining team has 3 workers which you deploy to either explore and uncover new resources to be mined, mine resources that have already been discovered, or process raw mined materials into processed goods that will save weight and space on the Earth return vehicle for the trip home.  The game consists of 12 rounds with each round being broken up into 6 distinct stages.<br/><br/>Worker placement, dice rolling, and timing are the key mechanics to this game as choice of available cards and locations on the board are chosen in succession beginning with the starting player for the round.  Placing more than one worker for mining will increase the odds that more resources are produced, but at the same time increases the risk of losing those workers to the damage sustained mechanic of the game that simulates the many dangers associated with this type of mission.  Management of water resources cannot be overstated as the teams will have to seek out sources on the surface to replenish water utilized to keep your team alive as well as operate the equipment on the surface.<br/><br/>Combining the most unique and exciting elements of outstanding games such as The Settlers of Catan, Agricola, and Stone Age with a science based approach to the prospect of mining for resources in space makes AIDLER-14 stand out compared to the many other space mining-type games that are on the market and makes for endless replayability and a lot of fun.<br/><br/>",

Altogether there are three different games and 4 puzzles to keep a young mind busy.<br/><br/>Naturally, there is a pre-school Top Trumps game with 12 cards. Each train is rated for Speed, Friendship, Adventure and Wisdom and each is illustrated in colour. This will be a short game which is right for the age group - they won't have time to get bored.<br/><br/>Secondly, you can play Pairs with the cards because there are 12 cards giving a description of each of the twelve trains. So the player won't find an exact match but will be able to find, say, two Chatsworth train cards.<br/><br/>Thirdly, there is a simple which is played a little like Rummy but much easier. You have a hand of five cards and you draw a card (from the stack or the top of the discard pile). If you get a matching pair, you may lay it down and discard one of your other cards on to the discard pile. The first person to get rid of all their cards, wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Website:<br/><br/>&quot;Station Run is a board game version of the computer game Elite, released by Ian Bell and David Braben in the mid 80s.<br/><br/>You and some other players need to get from one end of the game board to the other without your ship being destroyed. Other players might do it, or some of the random people who ply the spacelanes might get to you first.<br/><br/>Station Run is a free-to-download game. No need to whip out the credit card for this one, and no need to try and remember your paypal password.&quot;<br/><br/>From the free PDF rules:<br/><br/>&quot;Station Run is a game for one to four players. Each player is the pilot of a ship which has just hyperspaced into the system. They must get to the nearby planet&rsquo;s space station in order to sell cargo, refuel or whatever else they might want to do. The player can take on a number of roles. Traders are ferrying cargo between systems to make profit, which they can use to improve their ship or buy another one. Bounty Hunters are seeking out wrongdoers and bringing them to justice. Pirates are only interested in plundering the traders and stealing their cargo. Miners are looking for asteroids to mine for valuable minerals.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to get from one end of the game board to the other in one piece. Random encounters may occur, as other spacefarers and asteroids make their way around the planet&rsquo;s<br/>orbitspace. The game is designed to be open-ended and as freeform as possible (just like the computer game).&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Killer: Vanilla is a fast-paced card game with its tongue firmly in cheek. Players deal out death and destruction in many forms while trying to avoid the onslaught coming back at them. (This game is not recommended for children or those of a sensitive nature: bless 'em.) Kill off the weakest players to improve your hand as you balance defense and gear against a varied offense. Silent scoring heightens the tension... can you take another hit? Are Doctor De'Ath or the Booby Trap in someone's hand? Be the last man standing or take &lsquo;em all with you!<br/><br/>Each turn a player may: make an Attack (Hand to Hand, Ranged, Area, Special) against any other player; play an Equipment card (aid survival); or change any or all cards in hand. Defense cards (Parry, Evade, Flee, Safe House, other) protect against Attacks, while Follow Ups boost damage. Global cards generally apply to all players. If a player gets a killing blow, his hand limit increases and he takes his target's cards. After the first kill, the scoring goes silent, leaving players with only an impression of how close to elimination they are.<br/><br/>Killer:Vanilla is a take-that card game which suits a 'beer &amp; pretzels' mentality more than serious gaming. Play time is about 5 minutes per player, when you are used to the cards. The built-in expansion, The I In Team, adds some more complex solo cards as well as specific cards and rules for Team games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As the eastern bloc crumbles in 1989 Gorbatjov is ousted in a reactionary coup led by the Soviet military. In desperate attempt to turn back time and unite the eastern bloc the long prepared offensive into western Europe is launched.  A critical element for success is to be able to interdict the American reinforcements over the Atlantic to its NATO allies. That job belongs to the submarines of the arctic fleet in Murmansk. But they need air support and support from surface vessels as well and Murmansk is too far away from the North Atlantic seas to provide that support. In order to seize air fields and naval bases on the Norwegian west coast as fast as possible an invasion of Finland and Sweden is launched at the same time  as the Norwegian border is crossed on the Nordkapp to outflank the Norwegian easily defensible terrain along the northern coast.  Neutrality will not protect Sweden this time. But maybe an army of 600 000 trained men and 600 tanks will?<br/>This game deals with the southern part  of the Soviet operation against Sweden, the invasion of Sk&aring;ne. The well trained paratroopers of the VDV and the equally well trained Baltic marines land to face the bulk of the Swedish armoured brigades supported by infantry and artillery in terrain ideally suited for armoured units.  Will the Swedish built  turret less tank Strv 103 meet the expectations, though twenty years in service now, or will it be up to the British built Centurions, with more than thirty years in service,  to destroy the invaders? <br/>With X pages of rules, XXX counters X maps and  13 scenarios the game is designed to help understanding of the challenges of the Swedes as well as those of the Warpac. While gameplay is designed to be fast and easy with command and control issues being in the centre of the design the optional rules allow for deeper study into logistics and recovery. Units are platoons and each game turn equals one hour . Hexes are 500 meters across.<br/><br/>Hit fast! Hit hard! centres on the 7th armoured brigade, PB7 Malm&ouml;brigaden, and its hypothetical but well planned and trained actions around Ystad on the Scanian south coast.  Equipped with Strv 103C, the upgraded version of the famous &ldquo;S&rdquo; tank was the cutting edge of the XI. Division responsible for repelling or at least fixing an invasion  aimed at Ystad or Trelleborg. While PB7 might be superior in fire power to the air assault and naval infantry units it initially will encounter these are the elite units of the Soviet union. If the soviets seize a working harbour mechanised units with T-72M1 tanks are sure to pour in fast.  You will also see  parts of two different Swedish types of infantry brigades as well as territorial defence units  and the 12th independent mechanised battalion with Strv 102R, partly upgraded Centurions, and motorised rifle companies in trucks rather than Pbv 302 infantry fighting vehicles.<br/><br/>",

The new version is not only solitaire but incorporates all the best features of the previous Insurgency versions.<br/><br/>In this version, you lay down a grid of cards representing various terrain in your command area.  Underneath are secretly placed a variety of cards that could be decoys or real insurgency units of various sizes.  One card is a HVT (High Value Target). You draw a random hand and have 3 turns to find and destroy the HVT using those resources.  Your resources could include intel units to help you locate the HVT, combat units to destroy it or any insurgents, support units to add strength to your combat units, or local national units to help in both intel and combat.<br/><br/>",

They will be chosen as our tribal champion!' The tribes people work hard to impress them. They recount stories they were told as youngsters, hunt bison, gather berries and defend the village against rival tribes. Soon they will find out which one of them will achieve the most glory and earn the respect of the wise ones.&quot;<br/><br/>Triba Vivo is a simple card game with an Esperanto theme, as componets are written in this language. Players try to get the majority of the cards of one of four types in order to get victory points. The point values for each type range from 0 up to 3, and this is defined randomly at the begining of each round. The game lasts as much rounds as needed until one player gets 12 victory points, who then wins the game.<br/><br/>Each round has two phases. First, each player gets 5 cards. Then 1 card is drew from the deck and put face up at the end of each point of a five-point Esperanto-Star depicted on the gameboard. Next players alternately select 1 card from their hands and put it in one of the 5 points of the Star (up to a maximum equal to the number of players plus one), not covering completely the card below. The player also has to put one of his/her playing pieces in anyone of the numbered rondels along each arm of the Esperanto-Star. At the end of this phase all cards and pieces will have been set upon the game board.<br/><br/>Now comes the second phase. Beginning with the star arm marked with a small white star, each star arm is resolved clockwise in the following manner. The player who has a piece of his/her color in the highest rank, as defined by the numbers on the rondels (lowest numbers are highest) is the first to take one of any of the cards on that star arm. Then the second highest player selects one of the remaining cards, and so on, until each player took one card. There will be one card left behind on the star point. Remaining star arms are resolved in the same way. Victory points are then scored according to the rules described above. If none achieves 12 points, a new round begins.<br/><br/>",

The board is made up of many different planets currently inhabited by biological lifeforms. Each players starts with their own planet, some units, and some generators. As generators produce more units and currency, you will expand to different plants and destroy the inhabitants. Currency can be used to buy upgrades, more generators, and tech cards. Tech cards allow you to modify the moves you take, some will even give you the power to destroy entire planets.<br/><br/>This is a game of pure strategy; there are no dice rolls, random card draws, or any form of luck. Combat is resolved with a calculation of attack and defensive power, and these powers can be improved throughout the game. By the end of this war, armies will spread across the system, devastate their opponents forces, and even destroy planets.<br/><br/>",

First copy the two green footprints on thin card so that they can be cut out separately and used for counters. Next make a cardboard top, as shown on the right, and push a used matchstick through the centre to make it spin.<br/><br/>One player chooses the track marked L, and the other the track marked R, Each places his counter on the correct green footprint at the start. Take turns to spin the top. The number which rests on the table tells you how far you may move. Sooner or later one of you will land on the green footprint of your track. If the other player&rsquo;s next turn takes his counter on to the other green footprint, he has made a &ldquo;pair&rdquo; and so wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players then roll the die again to see what lure they choose and if they roll the right lure, they roll again to see if any fish are caught.

If they can't defeat it before it becomes powerful enough, the kingdom is lost.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player rolls a die to see how far he can move, moves up to that distance, and then takes an action wherever he lands (which usually involves drawing a card to see what encounter he has).  During play, players will collect &quot;Quest&quot; cards, which challenge them to travel to specific mysterious locations on the board and confront special monsters there.  Doing so earns them gemstones, and they need three to enter the castle to challenge the Chimera.  If a player rolls a &quot;1&quot; on the movement die, a strength token is added to the Chimera, and if the Chimera gets 11 tokens, it wins.<br/><br/>The game includes a simple advancement system for the characters; the players earn money for defeating enemies, and they can spend that money in the training hall to buy new skills for their characters.<br/><br/>Combat is handled with a simple die roll.  Each monster has a target roll the player must hit; rolling the target number or higher harms the monster, rolling below harms the player's character.  Once characters have advanced their skills, they can start to roll two or more dice instead of just one to see if they can roll a die that meets or beats the target number.<br/><br/>If the players manage to get into the castle and defeat the Chimera before it gets 11 tokens, they win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This dexterity game based on Jacks (Jackstones) won The Boardroomers Contest. Criteria was to use up to 20 playing cards and 10 game cubes and nothing else.<br/><br/>To play, all you need are the A-9 in 2 suits from a deck of cards and 10 game cubes. Each player gets a suit and organizes the cards according to rankings.<br/><br/>On your turn, place the number of cubes equal to the card number in play onto the table/floor. Organize the cubes to mimic the pattern of the pips on the playing card with ample space between cubes.<br/><br/>Grab an extra cube, toss it into the air, flip over your hand and quickly pick up all the cubes representing your card, and then catch the tossed cube in the same hand.<br/><br/>Complete a card and move on to the next one on your turn. Miss and play passes to your opponent. First player to complete all 9 cards is the winner.<br/><br/>HERE ARE THE COMPLETE RULES:<br/><br/>PIP UP CUBES - A dexterity game for 2 players, ages 9+<br/>Designed by Bonnie Neubauer <br/>Winner of the Boardroomers February 2013 Design Contest <br/>(c) 2013 Bonnie Neubauer<br/><br/>Goal: Be the first player to work your way through all 9 of your cards, picking up cubes from the table (or floor) that are placed in the same pattern as the pips/symbols on the cards. You do this by tossing 1 cube in the air and, with the same hand, scoop up cubes from the table, then catch the tossed cube in that same hand... without dropping any cubes.<br/><br/>Components: 10 cubes &amp; 18 poker cards: A-9 of hearts or diamonds and A-9 of spades or clubs.<br/><br/>Set-up: Place the 10 cubes between both players. <br/>The 9 red cards go to one player, the 9 black to the other. <br/>Each divides her pack into 3 parts: Ace, 2-5, 6-9. <br/>Each places their Ace face-down on the table/floor. Then they shuffle their 2,3,4,5 cards and place them, face down on top of the Ace, each forming her own unique stack. Players both shuffle the 6,7,8,9 cards and each place them face-down on their stacks. <br/>Both players flip over their stacks so the Aces are face-up. Neither looks at the cards below. <br/>Player who is closest to 9 years of age goes first.<br/><br/>Play: First player places 1 cube on the table/floor. She tosses another cube in the air and, with that same hand, scoops up the table cube, and then catches the tossed cube in the same hand with the cube she picked up... without dropping any cubes. Do this and you accomplish the card!<br/><br/>If the first player fails to accomplish this (she dropped a cube or didn't catch the tossed cube), her turn is over and play moves to her opponent who attempts her own Ace card (picking up 1 cube).  <br/>Once a player successfully completes the Ace card, she places it on the bottom of her stack. This reveals her next card. It will be a 2,3,4, or 5. Her turn continues.<br/><br/>For cards 2-9, players place that number of cubes on the table, following the pattern of the pips/symbols on the card. All cubes should have at least a 1/8 inch space between them if you are playing with 1/2 inch cubes. Handicap players to even out skill, by adding more space or using less space between cubes. Here's what cubes will look like on the table for cards 3, 5, 6, 8:<br/><br/>A player's turn lasts until she fails to accomplish a card (drops cubes or fails to catch the tossed cube). This card stays face-up on top of her stack and she will re-start with this card on her next turn. Likewise, her opponent starts with the card that was left face-up on her own deck at the end of her last turn.  Once you are using cards greater than 4, you will have to re-arrange the cubes on the table each time your turn starts.<br/><br/>Turns continue back and forth. Players will be going for different cards most of the time. As each card is accomplished, it's placed on the bottom of the deck and the next card is immediately attempted on the same turn.<br/><br/>Winner: First player to successfully make it through all 9 of her cards wins. If she went first, the other player gets one last turn to catch her. If there is a tie, re-play the 9 card and first wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tajemnice Krainy Ducha G&oacute;r is an educational game about places of touristic interest around Jelenia G&oacute;ra. Players are tourist guides competing to take their groups to most interesting places, while their actions are limited by cards in hand and time tokens they are given.<br/><br/>The game deck consists of two types of cards: sightseeing places and interesting facts. Places make up the trip each player's group takes and are a basis for scoring, while facts can add to the score or even (when played at a correct place) can multiply it. Playing places costs time tokens and playing facts costs cards in hand, so finally all players are left with nothing to do and the game ends. The winner is the player with most points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fantasy Warriors is a wargame about fantasy armies clashing on a battlefield.<br/><br/>It is not a skirmish game but a game that revolves around units that move in ranks.<br/><br/>The main focus of the game is the strategic deployment of units and the kind of orders the units have. Every units will have a generic behaviour depending by the orders thay have and will change that only if a new order is delivered. Greater armies will have a more complex chain of command so orders must be delivered by voice or by other means (banner bearers and herlads can be too far) so couriers are employed.<br/><br/>The careful management of orders given or changed during a game is the key to vistory because you must be able to react to the situations that can arise! And be sure to have competent leaders on the field (another aspect of the game this one)!<br/><br/>The first scouting part of the game help the players to shape and organize the battlefield and the scenary elements on it, then it's time for omens and leaders' speeches to rise morale and motivations of troops.<br/><br/>From that moment on the most common things seen on the battlefield will be, in this order, the ranged attack phase, the combat phase and the reorganization/change orders phase.<br/><br/>Magic will obviously alter mechanics, supllying for an exemple to the lack of good communications on distances, but do not confide too much in the bizzarries of magic!<br/><br/>D10-sided dices are rolled to check the outcome of actions, attacks and potentially morale-shakening events (like the death of your Leader or seeing your comrades wiped out in few minutes).<br/><br/>Special items to be defended or positions to be conquered represnt the objectives but, obviously, it is possible to concede to the adversary when things are clearly FUBAR.<br/><br/>Constant management of leadership, C&amp;C chain of command and orders given make Fantasy Warriors a game that can be very different from other fantasy wargames out there.<br/><br/>Tens of races and units add excellent variability to the game that has been published firts time in 1990.<br/><br/>This new edition in particular is an ambitious idea that strives in bringing to life the Fantasy Warriors world, creating pratically from scratch the theatre where the exciting battles and stories of valour, sacrifice and war are going to unfold.<br/>The old &quot;Warrior&quot; magazine, published by Grenadier (many wargame players will for sure remember good memories here!), described in very brief and fast strokes some of the places that composed the savage and grim fantasy world of the game, but it never brought it forward a complete gazzetteer of a region, a map or some of the peculiarities that races, tribes and people of this world share (or fight for!).<br/><br/>Contributors to this campaign will have the opportunity to see again a great classic of the fantasy wargame world having a new life, helping us in bringing the game to new heights where the old Grenadier never had time to reach.<br/><br/>This campaign will drive forward the game to develop the well-proven mechanics of Fantasy Warriors into new terrains, new rules for naval and seaside battles, sieges, fortifications, city fight and more ideas we are testing yet to see what we can add to this wonderful ruleset.<br/><br/>A real background world will be fully developed, with maps, cultures and tens of races, something the old Grenadier never did in details.<br/><br/>If this campaign will meet success. future is going to see new armies, beasts, wondrous vehicles and buildings.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rather than go to war, the indigenous tribes of Chelonia have invented a novel way of settling disputes. As my learned reader will no doubt be aware, Chelonia is the last remaining habitat of Proganochelys quenstedti, the roof turtle; now hunted to extinction elsewhere because of its colourful shell. The natives play a game on the backs of the turtles, which is described below. Naturally, the game must be played quickly before the affronted turtle reaches the water and swims off.<br/><br/>In Turtle Thumb Tussle, two players use their hands to occupy territory on a board resembling a turtle's shell.  Players roll dice to determine which finger moves next, and to what colour.  Think Twister meets Sumo with hands instead of bodies, and you won't be far off the mark!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the humble forest village of Elderwood, trouble is stirring.  The Great Tree that has been a beacon of light and hope for the villagers, may now be the cause of the village&rsquo;s demise.  Evil forces are at work, and their goal seems to be the destruction of the tree.  A horde of dangerous beasts and magical creatures have continuously been assailing the village.  Who or what is controlling them has yet to be discovered.  The villagers&rsquo; resilience has so far kept the monsters at bay, but the attacks grow more difficult with each wave.  Yet while all may seem lost, fate has stepped in to give the villagers one last hope.  A mysterious stranger by the name of Balthazar has appeared from outside and has agreed to help the village.  He has identified four local youths who have started showing signs of talent to control the elements.  If they can learn to develop and harness this power in time, Elderwood can be saved!<br/><br/>In Mythic Mages: Defenders of Elderwood, players take on the role of apprentice mages who must learn the ways of magic and use these new skills to save the village from certain destruction.  Mythic Mages is a deck-building game with a truly cooperative slant.  Players are not only building their own decks carefully, but must also be aware of what the other players are building in theirs.  To best complement each other, players will occasionally have the ability to pass or swap cards to optimize their team performance.<br/><br/>",

Times are tough for them, hunting &amp; gathering food in the cold weather.<br/><br/>Man, Primitive's game-play has several different movement factors. A large game board that represents the northern region of Palagon is where the players begin their journey. One space at a time they move. During encounters, they will take place on the Battle Board. The Battle Board is a smaller board laid out for tactical movement around creatures. Players will move according to their character card's Speed setting. The mechanic of the encounters revolve around rolling a custom &quot;Fate Die&quot; along with a d10 to determine the outcome. Damage will be rolled according to the weapon's damage die. The characters village will be upgraded throughout the game along with weapons being crafted from materials found along the way. 4 players will be the characters and 1 player will be the Great Spirit(GM). Solo adventures are being created for those in between larger games to acquire better items.<br/><br/>Man, Primitive's goal is just what the real primitive's goal was to do; survive. There are 11 hunting quests each lasting an average of 1 hour. The players will need to make it through all of quests, build up their village and craft their weapons. The players will be upgrading everything for fear of the Ice Lord returning with it's minions. A final boss fight will ensue. Already planned expansions will finish the story and conjure some creatures the players have never seen.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lover'sopoly was created for the sole intended purpose of creating a game intended for married couples that most adult board games on the market today do not offer.  Most adult board games today are very shallow and have no depth to them.  married couples have often purchased &quot;sex games&quot; that come and go and offer no substance.  Lover'sopoly touches on every level of marriage relationship from intimacy, to sex, to romance and even humor.<br/><br/>The players are by rolling the dice and advancing to the next space.  Spaces consist of &quot;action spaces&quot; as well as &quot;Pandora's Box&quot; and &quot;Naughty or Nice&quot;.  When landing on an action space the individual has the right to purchase the space and build on the space &quot;time chips&quot;.  By purchasing more time chips they receive more time with the action when their spouse lands on it.  &quot;Padora's Box&quot; and &quot;Naughty or Nice&quot; are not properties open to ownership but rather actions or questions that are fueled throughout the game and keep the game interesting and moving along.  The goal is to own as many of the desired action properties but watch out because your partner may earn the right to purchase an action property right from under your nose.<br/><br/>The action properties are the most creative portion of the game.  Ladies, how would you like to receive a nice 3 minute kneck massage every time your partner lands on your space?  <br/>Or perhaps you wouldn&rsquo;t mind your partner drawing a seductive pose of you in your birthday suite?  Men, how would you like your spouse enjoying a nice dessert off of your mid-section?  Or perhaps having your wife describe your most attractive features?<br/><br/>This game has everything for both male and female and is the perfect way to spark up a relationship.  Loversopoly makes the best Valentine&rsquo;s Day gift as well.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A taijitu is a symbol representing the balance between opposing forces. (For example, the Yin-Yang symbol is a taijitu.)<br/><br/>It is also the name of this two player game set on an octagonal board made of hexagons. There are three types of pieces- player one's black pieces, player two's white pieces, and a type of piece both players can use that is grey. All of these pieces start in the center of the board, connected together. Along the eight sides of the board are scoring markers called Trigrams. The first player to land one of their pieces (never the grey ones) onto four of these Trigrams wins the game.<br/><br/>A player's turn is to take two actions, and an action is simply moving a piece they are allowed to move to any unoccupied adjacent space. A player is allowed to move either pieces of their color or grey pieces, but with these two cardinal rules: First, they are not allowed to move any grey pieces the other player moved on their previous turn, and, second, no piece may ever be separate from the rest of the pieces at the end of any action.<br/><br/>When a player scores a Trigram, they flip the piece that landed on it to its other side, which now makes it a normal grey piece. This means as one player is winning, they will also have a more difficult time scoring.<br/><br/>",

Each player is Taffy, trying to be the &quot;hostess with the mostest&quot; by making the right scene with the right guests.<br/>     Players start with random guest cards for all the parties.  You make the party rounds according to your calls on the telephone.  The spaces on the board match the shapes of the guest cards.  Whenever you land in a space for which you have a guest card for a matching shape, you must place that guest in the space.  Funny scenes will develop, such as pajamas appearing at the formal party, guests in bathing suits frolicking in the snow, etc.<br/>     Whenever you are able to take the correct guest to the correct party, you receive a picture card.  The WINNER is the player who can show she is the best hostess by placing the most guests correctly and collecting the most pictures.&quot;<br/><br/>",

However, all the tiles have images on them and placing a tile requires you to come up with what the tile has in common with the tile next to it.  A cloud and an umbrella might be connected by &quot;rain,&quot; for instance, while a criminal and coffee might be connected by &quot;words starting with C.&quot;  You're only able to use any kind of connection once in your line, and your opponent might break up your line with a bomb tile and force you to rethink connections on the fly, so making the 10 connections you need to win the game will take an agile mind and a creative spirit!<br/><br/>",

Players move their pawns through this circle in a similar manner to the outer circle.<br/><br/>When a player has accumulated sufficient wealth and experience from game spaces, cards, and negotiations, he may move to the &quot;inner path and winner's circle&quot;. If a player has completed the requirements for wealth and experience ahead of his opponents, he moves to the winner's circle and wins the game.<br/><br/>From the game box:<br/><br/>&quot;Million Dollar Idea is an exciting new board game in which players escape the corporate rut and exercise their entrepreneurial spirit. In Million Dollar Idea you market your own 'great idea' by forming a company, obtaining financing and making money through the sales of your invention. Unfortunately while you strive for success, dilemmas such as competitors who steal your ideas, union problems, lawsuits, and the ever-present threat of a hostile take-over test your business acumen while doubling your blood pressure.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gerontopoly game is aimed at helping health professionals and students gain greater awareness and sensitivity toward aging-related changes. The object of the game is to gain as much life satisfaction as possible without losing money, while avoiding developing chronic diseases. Players roll the dices and move their pieces around a board much as they do in similar recreational games of chance, but their &quot;purchases&quot; are mundane personal aids such as dentures, hearing aids and walkers. Players of Gerontopoly can find themselves detained in the nursing home, adult day care center or hospital. On the upswing, each time they pass GO, they receive $300 from Social Security. During the game, players try to avoid getting &quot;Chronic Disease&quot; cards and attempt to collect as many &quot;Life Satisfaction&quot; cards and as much money as possible. They try to accomplish this by answering various questions about aging including: *With normal aging, which declines the least--hearing, smell, taste or vision? Answering 'taste' earns the player $50. The acceptance of Gerontopoly by non-health care professionals helps to widen the scope of people learning about aging lifestyles.<br/><br/>In a 2-phase study, the acceptability and efficacy of the game was evaluated. Using a 22-item, postgame questionnaire, the 190 dental students, 23 dental hygiene students, 25 college sociology students. Results also suggest the game can change attitudes and enhance awareness about the concerns of the elderly.<br/><br/>",

Be incautious yourself and try to build an even more legendary legend!<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round all the dice are rolled and grouped by their value.<br/><br/>In turn, each player chooses one group of dice and place it beside a deck of his choice in order to recruit Heroes, accepting new Missions or discover new lands (and the monster that lives there!) recovering special items.<br/><br/>When all the dice will be placed, each player in turn will use one or more heroes from his hand in order to defeat the monsters. The colour of the dice used to discover the land determines the skills the hero must have in order to participate to the battle.<br/><br/>The recruited Heroes will be added to the player&rsquo;s hand, while Missions, defeated Monsters and Items will be placed in front of him side by side forming the timeline of his legend.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player will gain points for each item, monster and accomplished mission.<br/><br/>To be accomplished, some of the missions requires the player to discover certain items or to kill a specific monster (so only the cards placed after the Mission in the timeline will be considered), while some other requires the player to have already discovered certain items or killed a monster (so, in this case only the cards placed before the Mission in the timeline will be considered).<br/><br/>The player with the most points will be the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Isle of Domination is a turn-based strategy-economy Print &amp; Play board Eurogame.<br/><br/>Players can build cities, armies on game map. Gameplay goes around resources. There are two types of resources: Countable resources like food, wood, stone, ore, test-tube and gold. Special resources like horse, iron, fish, wheat, marble, diamond and mana are used to develop (science) or build (building) something. There is no storage for resources, a player needs to have access (by having a city near the resource) to certain number and type of resources to build something. Food is the most important resource, each city, extra population and army eats one food. You need food-surplus to build a city/army/extra population, but no problem if your food production goes under your food production (no starving to death).<br/><br/>Each player has an economical page (like character page in RPGs), that shows the state of his empire. Players use small  markers (for example: coins) for recording various things.<br/><br/>Player's turn have 4 phases:<br/><br/>     random event phase: A random event happens, that has effect to all players, usually a positive thing to each player.<br/>     money phase: Player adds the number of his/her gold production to treasury. (Gold is the only resource in Isle of Domination, that is storaged.)<br/>     army moving phase: Players can move their armies by grid lines of hexes. Combat system is very simple: if attacker's army is stronger than defender army, defender army has to be withdrawn. No dice rolling this time. Army power is based on sciences, and have modifiers by terrain, city or buildings.<br/>     building phase: Player can build a city (on a hex edge occupied by an army), increase population, build an army, develop a science and/or build a building in this phase.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of this game is to reach one of the six Victory Conditions. It is possible that all other Players have stronger economies, stronger armies and bigger empires, but still you win because you reach one of the Victory Conditions.<br/>There are 6 different types of Victory:<br/><br/>     Territory Victory: You dominate by having a large number of cities.<br/>     Military Victory: You dominate by having a very strong and large army.<br/>     Population Victory: You dominate by outnumbering others in population.<br/>     Science Victory: You dominate by knowledge. (You develop Future Science 2.)<br/>     Cultural Victory: You dominate by your people's cultural influence. (You build Cathedral.)<br/>     Magical Victory: You dominate by magical superiority. (You have a city near every Mana resource.)<br/><br/><br/>Informational page contains exact numbers regarding the conditions above.<br/><br/>Game map has a random factor - dice-rolls determine one extra resource for each hex. This way, certain resources may have shortage or abundance, so diferent strategies can succeed in each game.<br/>Randomized map preparation may make some of the Victory types easier than others. But when several players pursuit the same victory, it will be much more difficult to achieve it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For centuries, the two kingdoms of F and B have fought each other in a peculiar way. Whenever war is declared, The Flag of The Old Empire is placed in the middle of The Ground, the contested borderland between the two kingdoms, and the two armies engage in battle to take control of The Flag and carry it into the opponent's lands: the first army to do so is declared victorious.<br/><br/>A Fair Battleground is a non-historical wargame set in a pseudo-Napoleonic era. To win, you must push the opposing army back or outmaneuver it, so that your own army can advance and eventually carry The Flag into the other player&rsquo;s territory. Meanwhile, the opponent can engage you in battles to stop your advancement and try to take control of The Flag.<br/><br/>In A Fair Battleground, skillful deployment and maneuvering is more important than raw impact, but typical winning tactical moves of the era like attacking the opposing armies from behind are forbidden. Asymmetry between players is given not by a different mix of forces or objectives, but rather by the interplay of two pairs of opposing roles (Advancing vs Contending and Attacker vs Defender) that the two players take and exchange during the game. These roles determine both what the players can do and when they can do it, as well as which of the different armies are more useful to each of them.<br/><br/>Battle resolution is basically luck-less, but a simple optional rule that adds a random factor is provided for players who prefer luck-based systems.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>A Fair Battleground is a print-and-play game that uses a board and 20 counters; the players must supply 9 euro-cubes or similar objects to be used as markers, and, optionally, two six-sided dice.<br/><br/>A Fair Battleground was an entry in the 2013 Two-Player Print-and-Play Design Contest.<br/><br/>",

Use aerial recon to scout your enemy and counterintelligence to thwart their offensive. Muster your troops and mount your attacks in a race to inflict the most damage!<br/><br/>Aligned as teams or playing head-to-head, players arrange their cards on the battlefield as they attempt to launch an offensive and score attack points. Opponents can use Sabotage cards to stall an offensive and disable any future attacks until the Sabotage cards have been remedied. Perk cards can be played to permanently prevent a particular Sabotage card from being used. Hand management is an important part of the game as, to win, a team or player must reach an attack score of exactly 1,000 to win the battle. Multiple battles are played and scored as part of a campaign in which teams or players attempt to be the first to reach a total of 5,000 victory points.<br/><br/>",

Travelling in planes, players try to avoid perils along the way to the other side of the Atlantic Ocean in the least amount of time.<br/><br/>The board contains various travel points along the route, showing your planned journey.  On your turn you spin and move your plane the number shown on the spinner.  If this would take you past a landing station you must remain where you are until you spin an exact number.  You are considered on schedule as long as you don't land on any delay spots, and you may even deduct time if you land on a &quot;time spot&quot;.  If you land on an &quot;off course&quot; spot, then you must take an alternate (longer) route to your journey.  You may land on a forced landing spot or run out of gasoline depending on which spot you land on.<br/><br/>At the end of the game you must total up the hours lost or gained to determine the fastest player and they are declared the winner.<br/><br/>An example of this game, given many years ago, was selected as an example of the evolution of America and is housed in the Americana collection of the Boston Childrens Museum.<br/><br/>",

Divide them into two separate packs, placing the Aces, Kings, Queens, Jacks, tens and nines into one pile and all the twos, threes, fours, fives, sixes, sevens and eights into another. Put them side by side face downwards on the table<br/><br/>Each player draws a card from each pack, turns them over and compares them with the pictures on this double page, where are depicted ten different birds with the number of their eggs and the value of the card. For example, if you draw an ace (Kestrel) you must return all the eggs you have collected except those of the Owl, Moorhen and Kestrel. If you draw a two (Rat), it steals any one egg and you must keep this card until you draw a Queen (Owl), in the meantime drawing one card only from the pack containing the picture cards. If you draw ^ King (Moorhen) you retain her egg but miss a round.<br/>Each player keeps an account of tiie number of eggs he has collected during the game, and at the end of the round subtracts his losses from the total. The cards are then returned to the bottom of their respective packs and shuffled for the next round. Play six rounds and then again add up your total.<br/><br/>The first player to collect ten different eggs wins the game.<br/><br/>You will find there are less cards in the picture pack and the round finishes after these have all been drawn<br/><br/>",

Line up ready for the start, cross the starting line, sail around the buoys and Windy Point, to be the first to cross the finishing line.<br/><br/>But, you can only sail a maximum speed according to the wind direction, and the wind direction changes...<br/><br/>Each move, you either move your ship OR you decide to change the wind direction. A wind direction change affects all players equally...and it may even result in a play direction switch. Sailing moves have realistic speeds, with six points of sail to the wind. So, for example, reaching across the wind is your fastest course, as is tacking to take you upwind. Your ship may block other ships...and watch out for the wind shadows from other ships or from the land! A person at the back of the race can influence all other ships by changing the wind direction. It is seldom the case that the first person around the first buoy stays in front...tactical sailing is required.<br/><br/>You can also sail as teams, whereby your tactics are determined with other sailors in mind. You can also organise a regatta (multiple sail races), so the best sailor of a few races is the winner. The point scoring method for these are described in the instructions.<br/><br/>",

Only one of those ideals will win out, and only then if they can remain united long enough to make their rebellion a success and avoid execution.<br/><br/>Hijack the Revolt is a cooperative game, up to a point. In this game of urban warfare there are four objectives which the three rebels must take before the Dictator sends reinforcement. They are Communications,  Munitions,  Airport, Presidential Palace. The game proceeds by each player in their turn playing a road taking tile to move them forward. You  have farther to go than the Dictator who advances automatically at the end of each turn. The only way to take an Objective is to coordinate your assault as you advance block by hard won block  But only one of you can win each round.

        "description": "The third volume in the HorizonWars Trilogy, following MechaWar and AirFrame, BattleGroup introduces the rest of the combined arms force to the game.<br/><br/>BattleGroup is a hard science fiction battle game for actions from platoon to battalion level that captures the tactical dynamic of the all-arms force.  Tanks, artillery and infantry must fight as a cohesive whole under the command of a single headquarters, but every army has its own style and emphasis - how will you lead?<br/><br/>Players assemble their forces from a menu of options based on their choice of Command Headquarters.  Battles are scenario-based in which each player must fight for competing priorities, with each taking their turn to activate a single element - but your opponent's forces can react to the actions of your own.  As elements take damage, their ability to fight on is gradually eroded or, if they suffer a critical hit, they may be destroyed entirely!  Should you put your injured soldiers into cover where they can patch up their injured and call up reinforcements?  Or should you press on for a vital objective?<br/><br/>The game is compatible with the other two volumes of HorizonWars, so you can add mighty mech battlesuits to your forces for additional punch and real sci-fi flavour, and dispatch squadrons of aircraft to lay down close support alongside your advancing troops.<br/><br/>The design draws deeply upon the experiences of the author, a former officer in the British Army, to deliver a high-quality tactical experience with a powerfully realistic feel, whilst still giving a play experience that can be completed in under an hour.<br/><br/>Key features:<br/><br/>    Miniatures wargame of modern/science fiction combat<br/>    Integrated turn sequence<br/>    Action-based turns<br/>    d12-based dice pool for &quot;one roll&quot; shooting actions<br/>    Customizable statlines<br/>    Compatible with MechaWar and AirFrame from One Pound Wargames<br/>    Designed for use with any range of modern or science fiction miniatures in scales from 1/805 (2mm) to 1/161 (10mm)<br/>    Includes advanced rules and three starting scenarios<br/><br/><br/>",

Your tactical skill, and a random factor determined by the roll of dice, shall decide who wins your own &ldquo;wars that never were&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The game depicts a Martian invasion of earth during steam technology era.  Players generate resources from specific units (such as mining units) each turn that can be used to 'purchase' combat units for use in the battle portion of the game.  It simulates the type of action found in many real-time-strategy (RTS) games where resources and facilities help guide what type of forces each player can bring to bear.<br/><br/>",

Players will also be able to design their own &quot;game sanctioned&quot; cards at the FlashNics.com website.<br/><br/>FlashNics allows you to recruit mercenaries from across the galaxy to battle for you against other competing entities. Mercenaries will compete against one another in one of four arenas that appeal to differing skill-sets. Winning across all four arenas and the ability to secure them (or winning in extreme fashion) is necessary to defeat your opponents.<br/><br/>Game Play :<br/><br/>One of four starting arenas is chosen. Each player starts with 6 mercenary cards (not shared) drawn randomly from the game deck. The first player chooses a card combination he/she will use to attempt to defend the arena depending on the attributes of the mercenary. The second player responds with a valid card combination (depending on the first combinations, others aren't allowed). Play then resumes until one player submits the round.<br/><br/>The player that wins the round can then decide to defend an arena with the mercenary used in the winning combination, or can choose to run protection with the mercenary. Each player then draws up to 6 cards again.<br/><br/>Hand maintenance is critical, as values accumulated depend on the strength of the victorious card (the least powerful cards score higher) and cards strength in each of the 4 arenas varies.  Once the original deck is near depletion, being aware of cards still in play is a valuable tactic.  Various modifier and action cards can also modify gameplay.<br/><br/>40 points are necessary to win the game (the sum of the mercenary protection values; double the value of this number if all four arenas are defended).  Advanced players can create exclusive mercenaries with unique actions at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://FlashNics.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://FlashNics.com</a> and use them directly in gameplay.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Colossus! is a free boardgame pitting giant monsters fighting each other on the tabletop. The game is presented as a generic ruleset, all players need is available using components they can build themselves or from other games and toys - most players won't need to buy anything they don&rsquo;t own already.<br/><br/>The game lets players build giant monsters, called colossi, using three types of Power Cards: Abilities, Attacks and Specials. Abilities represent the inherent skills and characteristics of the colossus. Specials are the unexpected and unique moves which colossi can perform in battle. Attacks and Attack modifiers represent any weapons and ways of fighting that the colossus might have including claws, teeth, horns, laser beams, rockets, atomic breath, a sharp beak, fireballs, etc.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 1/600 tabletop with no hexes or squares. There are 6 types of terrain: cities, hazardous, wet, high, tricky or industrial parks. Given the huge size of the colossi, these are little more than nuisances to their inexorable advance.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns broken in 8 phases: Air Strike Planning (determine where they land - random), Orders (draw Orders Cards and assign them to colossi under your command), Movement (move colossi based on Order Card), Ranged Attack (use Ranged Attacks if any), Close Attack (use Close Attacks if any), Tinies (move the human defenders towards closes colossus and attack it), Air Strike Attack (roll for damage on colossi under air strike coordinates), End (remove markers, check if somebody won, etc). The game ends when a side's colossi have all been knocked out or when a scenario's victory conditions are met (the rules come with 6 scenarios)<br/><br/>Colossus! comes with its own setting called The Zillium Wars which is featured in little snippets across the rules. This story-world has been deliberately left vague and open to the player&rsquo;s imagination. A range of possible colossi are suggested as starting points, but players are free to come up with their own concepts and model them using the cards available... or even invent their own cards! Hopefully there will be enough active players out there feeding back on the rules and how they use them so I can keep improving and expanding Colossus!<br/><br/>",

The game-play is quite simple, as players use their &quot;fish block&quot; to follow a path of spaces (similar to the Game of Life), and they use a die to determine how far they move in a given turn. Once the spawning grounds have been reached, further die rolls are used to determine how many fish are born.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most fish left when all players have reached the finish square.<br/><br/>",

(The open ends are pieces to which two sides remain unmatched to other pieces.)  This total is added to the player&rsquo;s score. There is a bonus for placing a tile in such a way to close a loop of tiles, as there is for blocking an opponent from play.  The first player to reach 500 points wins.<br/><br/>There is also a second variant of the rules called &quot;Trickets&quot;. It is similar to the card game Bridge.<br/><br/>",

The cards fit together a bit like dominoes.  They are inspired by atoms and how many bonds each atom can make by sharing electrons with other atoms - thus the name.<br/><br/>Shuffle the cards and deal out 7 cards to each player.  Place remaining cards in the center of the table and place the top card face up on the table.  There are three kinds of cards; regular atom cards can make single, double, or triple bonds to other atom cards, for which you get single, double or triple points; noble gas cards do not bond to any cards; ion cards only fit with one other card.  First player looks at the card on the table and at the cards in their hand.<br/><br/>If their is an oxygen card that can make two single bonds on the table, for example, first player needs to have a card in their hand that can also make a single bond.  This is easy to see by the design of the cards.  If the quality of the lines fit together, you have a bond.  An oxygen is worth 8 points.  If you bond a hydrogen to it, worth 1 point, you would get a total of 8 points for this move.  If this player does not have any single bonding cards, they could also play a noble gas, if they have one.  Neon, for example, would be worth ten points.  They would then put this noble gas card in their winnings stack.  They could also play an ion card.  Sodium, for example, would be worth 11 points, but it would stay on the table.  If NONE of these options is available, they must draw from the deck until they get a card that matches the one up on the table.<br/><br/>If a player is the last one to place an atom card onto the growing molecule in the middle of the table, meaning their are no more empty slots to bond any cards to, they not only get their points, but they get to keep all the cards in this molecule.   They stack up the cards and put it in their winnings pile, along with noble gasses or ion cards won.  In order to win the ion cards, a player must have the other half of the arrow pictured on the ion card.  They get the points for both cards, and then put them in their stack.  When one player has run out of cards, players add up the points they earned, plus ONE point for each card in their winnings stack.  They then subtract any points left in their hand.  If desired, play up to 200 points, or end the game after all players have had a chance to go first.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Three Dice Brick is a very addictive high scoring dice game in which one or more players roll for points. The player with the highest score of 3,000+ points in the final round of play wins the game. Once a player has achieved a winning point total of 3,000+ points each other player has one last turn to score enough points to surpass that high-score. Otherwise, any roll of the dice which results in a Sudden Death scoring combination is an automatic loss unless the other player throws a Single 1 scoring combination to reset the game. Three Dice Brick is played similarly to Six Dice Farkle, Cee-Lo and Cosmic Wimpout with a few variations. It comes with custom designed three translucent glow-n-the dark dice in a small clear plastic bag, score sheet and comprehensive instruction manual.<br/><br/>Gambling Style:<br/><br/>As a gambling game Three Dice Brick can arouse a great deal of excitement if played for a small stake. Each one of the players must contribute a similar fee to the pot. The one who finishes first wins the pot. There is no second place money and/or prizes! For those interested in the bar/club version of Three Dice Brick&trade; it&rsquo;s often played to determine a loser who must buy drinks for the other player(s), e.t.c.<br/><br/>Tournament Style:<br/><br/>Three Dice Brick&trade; tournaments can be held at house parties, local taverns, high school/college campuses, churches, clubs/bars, recreational facilities, civic centers, social networking sites, e.t.c. for whatever prize award individual Three Dice Brick&trade; clubs deem appropriate and winners can be awarded championship status or titles (i.e. Three Dice Brick King, Brick Master, Three Dice Brick Champion, e.t.c.). Three Dice Brick tournaments can be played by having players compete at several tables- with the winners at each table advancing to a final table for a Three Dice Brick head-to-head championship. The tournament feature of Three Dice Brick is especially entertaining for evening events at night since the dice are glow-n-the dark it makes for fun and competitive tournament play!<br/><br/>",

In each players turn they choose to pick and place one of the five different tiles available; a temple or one of the skills; Architecture, Conflict, Culture or Trade. Temples represent a headquarter for your devotees and may be placed anywhere on the table except in a civilization you already have a temple or next to another temple. Skills must be placed adjacent and orthogonal to another tile.<br/><br/>Placing a skill activates the surrounding and adjacent tiles. Choose between using their effects or to collect points.<br/><br/>Each game uses a set amount of each tile and as soon as one of the different tiles are run out the game ends. At that time the player with most points of the skill they have least of wins.<br/><br/>GODS is a brain burner. Players needs to be strategic while it is extremely difficult to predict the other players moves. A conflict may arise to destroy en entire civilization or through trade a civilization may loose much of its competence.<br/><br/>",

It focuses on a world building element, where all players contribute to an ever expanding playing field. Roads connect to Soul Wells, which are used to score the game and provide the magical energy players use to summon monsters or cast hexes. Players move along the system of rolls with a dice roll. Roads may also have other effects, such as reducing movement over harsh terrain, or increasing a player's draw.<br/><br/>Summoned Monster cards may be stationed in a controlled Soul Well to guard them against other players, or left in a  player's hand, so that they may attempt to conquer other players' Soul Wells. So there is a strong balance between defending your territory, while having enough strength to expand into enemy territory as well. Hexes are used to manipulate the playing field, support combat or increase draw capacity.<br/> When combat does occur, it has been designed to be accessible and casual, in which battles may be resolved quickly and easily without complex counting or score keeping mechanisms. This keeps the focus of the game on strategic use of the world and unique card abilities to play to a Soul Well's power.<br/><br/>By matching Soul Well or monster Domains with your Lord's (player token piece), a player can boost the power of his creatures, and make his territory more difficult to conquer, or activate specific Domain abilities for his monsters.<br/><br/>An average game takes 30 minutes to an hour for 2 people and 1 hour to 3 for 4 players. It all depends on how players shape their gaming world :)<br/><br/>",

With a look and feel of game that could have been played by men of the Norse whilst they drank and feasted in their Mead halls or even taken on the raiding trips and played at sea.  Hydra is a completely new game of intelligence and cunning, you must create an unbroken line of tiles from one side of the board to the other whilst stopping your opponent from doing the same. The first person to do so wins the game.<br/><br/>A unique feature of Hydra is that it is played East to West and North to South or it could be West to East and South to North. The game gets its name from the style of play of creating lines that get broken like they have been cut and then you must start a new one, just like when Hercules cut off one head of the Hydra another new one or two grow back. The game mechanics are very simple with only three different types of tiles and a single hand count of rules to beat your opponent.<br/><br/>Game play can take just a couple of minutes when you first learn to play, up to tens of minutes or more as you and your opponents learn the subtle flow of cunning tactics that are wrapped in Hydra.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game combined the &quot;capture the leader&quot; and geometric movement aspects of games like Chess, Xiangqi or Shogi with custodial capture such as is found in games like Petteia or Hnefatafl. Because capture then involves a combination of two pieces, control of the board is consciously distinguished from simply the ability to move to any given space. Hence, it resembles Chess up to a point but players have to think about relative positioning of their own pieces in combination and of the opponent's pieces to see what areas of the board they control.<br/><br/>Imperio is the Latin word which refers to having complete control over someone, to the power of life and death in principle. This game is about control of the board, which entails the power of life and death (so to speak) over the opponent's pieces. One has to think differently from most games average people today would know to achieve that type of control effectively.<br/><br/>",

Not with dry-as-dust theory, but in a completely child-oriented way. That's why we've developed MELTDOWN - the first board game that melts.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to take a polar bear family from the permanent ice floes to safety on the mainland. It's a race against time, as the way leads across real, slowly melting ice floes, which children can make themselves with the accompanying mould, a bit of water and a freezer compartment. The chunks of ice are arranged on a blue polar sea sponge to form a small Arctic. The sponge is used as the game board and absorbs the melted ice at the same time. Now you can start saving polar bears.<br/><br/>MELTDOWN makes children experience the effects of global warming in a playful way. Without any wagging finger - just one hand to roll the dice.<br/><br/>",

Once a winner is determined, players are requested to cheer on the remaining players until all youngsters reach the finish line, arriving at Queen Grace's marvelous tea party. Subtle illustrations such as a princess seated in a wheelchair reinforce empathy, a much-needed skill for kids to combat teasing or worse, bullying.<br/><br/>Be the first to collect all 8-neighborhood charms, the key to the Golden Gate of the Golden Rule and enter the royal tea party. As players make their way around the Kingdom, watch out for the 4 Slippery Slopes of Bad Manners and the 4 Faux Pas Spaces. Rainbow Baguettes and baby Daisy Fairy spaces help little princesses with shortcuts into the Golden Gate of the Golden Rule. Naturally, with the best of good manners, remaining players are to be cheered on as they make their way to the tea party. To keep the game fresh play after play, there are a whopping 368 question cards.<br/><br/>Beyond the board game, parents can keep up with their niceties by visiting Queen Grace on her Facebook Page, also called &quot;Kindness Kingdom&quot; where she imparts pearls of wisdom.<br/><br/>",

Players select a starship and move it along spaces on the board, collecting Discovery tokens and revealing encounters with other ships or special events. Ships can be friendly and traded with, like science crews or other merchants, or hostile like aliens and pirates. Events can be things like losing a turn from a faulty hyperdrive or discovering a new element. Players get rewarded (or lose) salvage from these encounters. Salvage can be used to buy upgrades to their ship, increasing firepower, shields, maneuverability, and so on. Combat is played out with rolling different dice. Xalvage points are won at the end of each fully explored sector, and are counted by adding up Discovery tokens. At the end of the game, whoever has collected the most Xalvage points wins.<br/><br/>",

The deck is made of a count up/count down card, four different colored links numbering 1-12 in each color, and flip cards.  The first person to play all their cards wins the game.<br/><br/>There are five short rules for the game.  <br/>1) Never play a card that has the same color as the top card in the chain.  <br/>2) If Count Up is facing up, the value of your card must be higher than the top card of the chain, unless you play a Flip card.  Likewise, if Count Down is facing up, the value of your card must be smaller than the top card of the chain, unless you play a Flip.  <br/>3) The three ways to flip the Count Down / Count Up card is to play a 1, play a 12, or play a flip.  If you play a 1 this flips the Count Down card to Count Up.  Play a 12 and the Count Up card to Count Down.  If you play a Flip, the Count Up / Count Down card to the opposite side.  <br/>4) When a Flip is played, the color of the Flip is what is used for Rule #1, and the value of the card under the Flip is the value you use for Rule #2 depending on what side the Count Up / Count Down is face up.  <br/>5)  If you can not play a card, draw one from the draw pile.  If you can play the card drawn, do so, if not play passes to the next person.  If there are no more cards to draw from shuffle all but the last two cards of the chain up and make them the draw deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Wash Out, players are trying to collect cards that depict the clothes hanging on their clothes line. They need to match both color and style.<br/><br/>The game is for 3-6, but the rules say 4 is best. The game is setup with each player sitting in front of a clothesline they wish to use for the game (these are depicted on the board). Then a number of clothespins equal to the number of players, minus 1, is put in the center of the board.<br/><br/>Each turn players will be looking at their hand of five cards, quickly, and passing one of them to the left after playing any that apply to themselves. The rules state this whole process should be done &quot;as rapidly as possible and may be done as noisily as desired.&quot;<br/><br/>When a player has the cards that depicts their clothesline, they quietly remove a clothespin from the center. Then all other players may do so.<br/><br/>This is repeated 5 times and end scoring determines the winner. Scoring is based on clothespins and number of cards completing their clothesline.<br/><br/>",

Upon getting three carrots the player wins.  However if the farmer is rolled then the player sends an opponent's bunny back to the start of the path.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game was 'designed' by an AI system developed by researchers from the IT University of Copenhagen in Denmark. The game was created for the NewScientist.com website.<br/><br/>The description below is from the NewScientist.com website (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23447-ai-card-game-knows-how-to-bend-the-rules.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23447-ai-card-game-kno...</a>):<br/><br/>The game begins with the dealer giving nine cards and 99 tokens to each player. The remainder of the deck is placed in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Each player then makes a mandatory bet of one or more tokens.<br/><br/>Each player then takes one card from the deck and shows it to the other players.<br/><br/>Each player can then take further cards from the deck, if they want, without showing the other players. But for every card taken, the player must discard three cards from their current hand.<br/><br/>Players can repeat the preceding until they have fewer than three cards left.<br/><br/>Once all players are happy with their hand, they reveal their cards. Ace, Jack, King, and Queen are valued as 10. The player with the highest combination wins the round and takes all tokens on the table.<br/><br/>Additional note:<br/>&quot;The player might notice a certain similarity to blackjack,&quot; say Font and Mahlmann. Indeed, the rules to blackjack were part of the initial gene pool that seeded the evolutionary run that produced the game. &quot;We believe that the game contains genetic material from blackjack. But we can't be sure. We didn't create the game, after all &ndash; our software did.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Agony is a solo word game.  The game components consist of tiny wooden (cherry-wood stain) blocks with embossed gold foil lettering, which fit perfectly in a maroon, plastic case that is the depth of only one block and opens so that only one face of each of the blocks can be seen at a time. There are 42 blocks in the set; each block has five letters on each block face with the sixth side blank.  (According to the description on the instructions, the distributions of letters are proportional based on common usage.) The object of the game is to arrange the blocks within the case to spell interlocking words (horizontally and vertically). The perfect game would show 13 words (seven words across, six words down) without using blanks. The number of blanks that are showing when the player is finished determines the score; each blank is worth one point.   Players attempt to score the lowest number possible.<br/><br/>There are two different sets of rules; one set is on a small slip of paper that can be removed from the case, while the other set of rules is glued to the inside, top lid.  Each set of rules has a different method of scoring, and a different set of game parameters, including different allowable word types and different descriptions of how the game is to be scored.    In one version, no prefixes, suffixes, or abbreviations can be used.<br/><br/>Though this is similar to a solvable word puzzle, the distribution of letters (and specifically the rules included with the game) suggests that there are multiple ways to get a perfect score and, therefore, multiple ways to win.<br/><br/>",

RoShamBo Rush was designed to be quick paced and to keep all players in the game with its system of catch-up logic. There is a very small learning curve, making it a great game to introduce newcomers to table top gaming.<br/><br/>As the name implies, Rock-Paper-Scissors is a large part of the game. Players duel each other using a set of cards that remain in each players possession throughout the game. Banter is encouraged. It is a good way to solicit a tell from your opponents. If you have people reading skills, they do come in handy.<br/><br/>The game features racers (pawns) that stand over 2&quot; tall. The racers are adorned with helmets and body armor when a player lands on a &quot;Armor Up&quot; space. Armor serves as insurance for losing a battle and keeps that racer from taking hit points in exchange for a piece of armor.<br/><br/>Though linear like a race course, you have decisions to make on your turn. Who will you battle? When is the best time to play your Twist Cards? Nobody coasts to an easy victory here. Only the scrappiest competitors will earn a place on the winners podium which only has limited space reserved for the top three racers.<br/><br/>",

Each game, one colour and one pattern scores one step higher than the others.<br/><br/>You can also add balloons, unicycles, tightropes, and juggling balls to extend your scoring!<br/><br/>Each player turn involves 3 main actions: 1) draw a card; 2) draw another card -or- swap a card -or- play a card; 3) play a card. You can only play cards if one of their characteristics matches the adjacent card. And you can only swap a card it it matches the one you are swapping it for. An optional extra action at the end of your turn allows you to discard a card to claim an accessory (nose or bucket).<br/><br/>",

All the corner squares of the board are red.  The game&rsquo;s pieces consist of 20 red and 20 black checkers, each with a pawn on one side, a crown on the other.  The game is played on the black squares of the board, with players&rsquo; pieces beginning on the black squares of the three closest rows.  Players may begin with any combination or formation of pawns and crowns, so long as they are identical to each other, though the instructions do provide three recommended ways to start: three rows of pawns, or one row of crowns and two of pawns, or two rows crowns and one of pawns.  Black moves first.<br/><br/>With the exception of the cross in the middle of the board, player movement is the same as an ordinary game of Checkers.  Pawns may move forward (left or right) one square only unless jumping and capturing an opponent&rsquo;s piece, when they may jump however many times there are openings.  Crowns may move and jump forward and backward.  Captured pieces are removed from the board.  Crowning of pawns takes place upon reaching the opponent&rsquo;s home row, or after moving over any four squares in the Trojan&rsquo;s Cross.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s instructions feature a number of diagrams describing what movements a pawn may make within the cross, how it may exit, what conditions it must meet to be crowned, how the opponent must be notified, and how the opponent may interrupt.  The game is won by capturing all of an opponent&rsquo;s pieces, or by blocking all of an opponent&rsquo;s pieces from moving, or by making seven uninterrupted moves within the cross.  Methods are provided for scoring, should players desire it for multiple matches, but the simplest method provided is one point for one victory.<br/><br/>",

You are the clan-chief of one of these tribes and responsible for your village. Build and expand your settlement, care for your followers and nurture your clan. Finally you will be able to build a massive army or achieve cultural superiority. Whatever path to victory you choose - the fantasy islands await you!&rdquo;<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the first player to collect 20 Victory Points. Each player starts with a tiny Starting Island made out of 7 hex tiles. Players will expand their islands in order to mine stone, ore and gather wood needed to build the more advanced buildings. Players will grow food and wine to keep their soldiers and wizards loyal and collect mana to cast powerful Spells.<br/><br/>In Fantasy Islands, many roads lead to victory: Pure Military force, Naval supremacy, securing the Trade monopoly, keeping your population happy, Cultural dominance or Spellcasting power.

Units are rated by a die (D4, D6, D8, or D10) in each attribute:  Discipline, Morale, Attack, and Armor.<br/><br/>Each unit must make a Discipline Test (with results of either Rash, Simple, or Strategic) each turn to determine what action it can or must perform.  Rash actions require units to make disadvantageous actions, while Strategic actions allow more complex actions such as reforming, force marching, and forming shieldwall.<br/><br/>The combat system is very &quot;Risk-like&quot; where the Armor dice of the defender are compared to the Attack (or missile) dice of the attacker, with each Attacking die that exceeds an Armor die causing a hit.  Units use their Morale attribute whenever they take damage to determine their reaction.<br/><br/>Army lists for Normans, Anglo-Saxons, Vikings, Franks, Bretons are included.  Six typical scenarios are included as well as a campaign system that links the scenarios.<br/><br/>",

In the process of playing, teenagers will be challenged to face the real consequences of sex.<br/><br/>While moving around the board, players will draw cards dealing with the subjects of Sex Facts, Health and Disease, Contraceptives, Sex and Values, and Sex and Success. Correctly answering the questions on these cards gives the player points.<br/><br/>Certain spaces on the board will force the player to spin the Sex Wheel of Fortune.  Of the several results on the spinner, one is pregnancy. Some spaces also will cause a pregnancy. Failure to maintain your score above a certain point will also result in pregnancy.<br/><br/>Pregnancy forces players into a Dilemma. Female players will have to decide on which path to take: Adoption, Motherhood, or Abortion. Male players will have to decide on which path to take: Support or Marriage. Each choice may have different consequences affecting a player's score.<br/><br/>After a predetermined period of gameplay, players will tally their scores.  The player(s) with the higher scores have increased their chances of success and happiness while those with lower scores have diminished their chances.<br/><br/>",

We plan to bring the game to Kickstarter this Fall. In Races of the Expanse each player takes turns picking a deck for their base creature, such as Crystaline, Humanoid, Crustacians, or Octopoids, Then in reverse order players choose a special ability Deck from clairvoyant, aquatic, subterranean, or creative. Your random homeworld will then add a regional events deck. These three decks will be Shuffled together, to form your races play deck. Extra races and abilities are planned as stretch goals. finally a communal planets deck is built based on the number of players. Play proceeds clockwise from a random start player.<br/>    All players start with a hand of five cards. Player 1 plays up to two cards, and then draws two cards, unless affected by cards or special abilities. Players may have no more than 10 cards in their hand. If, after drawing, you have more than ten cards, discard until you have only ten. If a player runs out of cards in their deck they shuffle their discarded cards and start the deck fresh. Play moves clockwise until the last planet is drawn. (Planets can only be drawn when Explorers are played.) When the last planet is drawn, each player gets one last turn, and then the game is ended and a winner is decided.<br/>    The player with the most resource at the end of the game is the winner. You get resource by having the most population on a planet. If two or more players have an equal amount of population on a planet, nobody gets the resource for that planet. The max population of a planet is in the upper lefthand corner of the planet card, the resource of that planet is in the lower righthand corner of the planet card.<br/><br/>",

The playfield is comprised of a series of three-dimensional blocks that can be re-configured to create paths.<br/><br/>To start, the three red and three blue home blocks are placed on opposite sides of the game board with the corresponding pawns on top. Each player rolls a die to determine how many action points (APs) he can spend on his turn; the points can be divided between moving pawns and modifying the board. The possible actions are:<br/><br/><br/>     Move (1 AP) &mdash; Move a pawn to any orthogonal, unoccupied adjacent face if the path is unbroken. If a player lands on an opposing pawn, that pawn returns to one of its home cubes.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Add Block (1 AP) &mdash; Add a purple block to the board adjacent to one of your pawns. This block defines a path that all players must follow. Blocks can be stacked vertically.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Rotate Block (2 AP) &mdash; Rotate any unoccupied adjacent block; blocks below other blocks cannot be rotated.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Remove Block (3 AP) &mdash; Remove any unoccupied adjacent block from the board; blocks below other blocks may not be removed.<br/><br/><br/>Red and blue home blocks cannot be rotated, removed or stacked upon.

        "description": "Eight Year Resistance War is a solitaire strategy game covering the Second Sino-Japanese War (July 7, 1937 &ndash; September 2, 1945), which was a military conflict fought primarily between the Republic of China and the Empire of Japan from 1937 to 1941. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the war merged into the greater conflict of World War II as a major front of what is broadly known as the Pacific War. The Second Sino-Japanese War was the largest Asian war in the 20th century. It also made up more than 50% of the casualties in the Pacific War if the 1937&ndash;1941 period is taken into account. Although the two countries had fought intermittently since 1931, total war started in earnest in 1937 and ended only with the surrender of Japan in 1945.<br/><br/>In this game, you, the player, lead China&rsquo;s Army (KMT Central Army) to fight against Japanese invasion. Major battles and historical events are represented by event cards which may be executed chronologically as the history (see the Historical Game option in 17.0), or randomly so as to make youself unprepared for what will happen in the next turn. You have to use your limited resources (limited number of actions, and event cards beneficial to you) to avoid Japanese capture of your Capital, Chungking. To do so, you need to gain support from Western Allies and the help from your unreliable temporary ally &ndash; Chinese Communist Party&rsquo;s Red Army, which will get the final victory (China) from you if you allow them to expand and gain sufficient political support among generals, soldiers and civilians.<br/><br/>Errata: Page 9, [15.1] &quot;i)...&quot; -&gt; &quot;the KMTPS level &lt;=20.&quot; <br/>Map file Page 3，step 2: Only the first &quot;2&quot;.<br/><br/>(You are always welcome for any comments or suggestions.)<br/><br/>",

Each Soldier represents a blunt Rock, a piece of Paper, or sharp pair Scissors. The standard rules of combat engagement are enforced that only allow Rock to attack Scissors, Scissors to attack Paper, and Paper to attack Rock. But player can change their form to attack otherwise unreachable opponents or avoid combat altogether. And all the rules can be bent or broken.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns with no set number of turns in a game. After a player loses all their Soldiers, they are out of the game.

The rumor is that if one particular object can be obtained, then that alien's race and home planet will be saved. Otherwise, their race will be exterminated and their home planet will be destroyed. One alien whispers to another, &quot;What are we looking for?&quot; The other alien snaps back, &quot;The Grail, of course.&quot;<br/><br/>Extraterrestrial Grail is a turn-based strategy board game for 2-4 players. Extraterrestrial Grail takes place in outer space in which you are an alien searching for the Grail. Only one player gets the Grail at the beginning of the game, so the other aliens must find out where it is by fighting each other and exploring planets for it.<br/><br/>Each player receives attribute cards at the beginning of the game. A player can only hold a maximum of 6 attribute cards in their hand at a time. All of the attribute cards that the player has chosen to not place in their hand must go into their planet boxes. Some attribute cards are weapons which remove life points from an enemy alien (bomb, missile, laser rifle, and etc.). Other attribute cards are designed to steal cards from other aliens (mug gloves, rope, and etc.). There are also attribute cards that let you safely search and give you the ability to search foreign planets (respiration headgear, flashlight, thermal garment, and etc.). There are many more kinds of attribute cards as well!<br/><br/>Turn Options:<br/><br/>     Roll die and move your alien (only once per turn)<br/>     Search a planet for attribute cards (if your alien token is on a planet)<br/>     Start a battle with an enemy alien located on the same space as your alien<br/>     Use attribute card(s) in your hand<br/><br/><br/>Battle Turn Options (choose one per battle turn):<br/><br/>     Use natural attack<br/>     Flee from battle<br/>     Use an attribute card in your hand<br/><br/><br/>The object of the game is to have the Grail in your hand when the alarm goes off or have the Grail in your hand when all the other aliens have been eliminated. If no one has the Grail in their hand when the timer alarm goes off, then everyone loses. For example: If there is time still left on the timer and only one alien is still alive, then that alien must find the Grail before time is up to win the game (the game will end when the last player standing finds the Grail).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Darkling Plain is a miniatures board game that is powered by augmented reality (AR). Darkling Plain combines all the best aspects of a traditional board game such as Settlers of Catan or Ticket to Ride and a video game such as Final Fantasy or World of Warcraft. Board games offer a social experience and depth of play, while video games offer immersion, glorious eye-candy, and computational wizardry.<br/><br/>There are no actual miniatures in Darkling Plain. You place cards that represent your units and other features, like a ring of standing stones or a village, upon a full-color game board. When the cards or board are viewed through the camera of a smart device or computer, the game comes to life like a video game. Spectacular special effects abound as a fantasy battle bursting with the magical and the medieval consumes your tabletop.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dai Sai Sou! includes 36 unique robo part cards with different characteristics, providing diversity to create up to 6 robos at once. Part cards have a maintenance gauge, defense, melee and range attacks, and a special ability. Players will use these parts to attack their opponent's robo. In addition, players will be able to use action cards to modify attacks and defend against oncoming bombardment. A dice roll plus your modifiers from the robo part you use to attack and action card will have to beat your opponent's armor for the robo part you attack. A successful hit lowers the opponents maintenance gauge, usually by one level.<br/>Parts will take damage when hit. If a part takes too much damage, they can become inoperable and are at risk of blowing up, leaving you more vulnerable. If a player disables too many parts or destroys the chest part of a robo, then that robo is destroyed. Some may be fortunate enough to collect the necessary cards to perform an ultimate attack that will turn their opponents&rsquo; robo parts into scrap metal. Make sure you're the last one standing in this robo-royale.<br/><br/>",

All aspects of military decision making processes will be encompassed; combat troops to medics, logistics and even finance will add intricate layers to the game for advanced players and quick combat bonuses described in detail for beginners. With smooth game play and tactical decision making, you will enter the world of the military commander.<br/><br/>Even with its military structure, Armored will appeal to all those who have no military experience and just enjoy card games.  Whether you enjoy creating multiple decks, each with their own playing style or just having your primary deck that dominates your opponents - Armored will engage you.  From the beginning steps of creating your deck and identifying your playing style to the actual battle, all your favorite card game experiences are still there.<br/><br/>On each card, one asset is shown along with the accurate information for that vehicle, weapon system, troop or other asset such as stats and associated military symbology. Much like other card games, Armored is played with 'Attack' and 'Defense' stats. Specific to military requirements of movement and weapons, 'Range' and 'Weight' have been added.<br/><br/>Armored can be played with 2 or more players on a tabletop or map. Each player has a minimum of three rows that are active within the game. It is within these rows that assets are introduced and maneuvered onto the playing field. Columns have been included to create a grid structure required as assets advance, retreat and evade their opponent. The majority of the individuals who will play Armored will use standard approaches based on deck preference and card stats.<br/><br/>",
