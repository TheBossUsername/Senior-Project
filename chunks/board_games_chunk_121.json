        "description": "Strip is a dice game aimed at the adult market.<br/>It consists of 6 'boards' each featuring a different lady. Each board has nine flaps that, when turned over, will reveal the lady pictured without clothes on. The illustrations are rather well-done, rather like Pin-ups in the 1950's.<br/>Three dice are rolled and the player first uses one die to choose which lady he 'owns'. The ladies are numbered 1 to 6.<br/>Everybody chooses a lady to represent. Having chosen a lady by using the appropriate die, he uses the other two dice to turn over one or more of her flaps. This is done by using the two individual die numbers to 'open' two flaps or one flap using the total of the two dice.<br/>Further choices are that he may re-clothe his own lady, utilising the dice as described earlier.<br/>If a lady is stripped completely, the 'owner' puts a token representing a life into the 'pot'. If a player loses 3 lives he is out of the game. The winner will be the last player with an unstripped lady.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The aim of the game is to get your family of 3 across the valley of death to the safety of their new home.<br/><br/>To do this you have 2 dice, you can use the number as one whole number for one Lemming or you can split the dice and move two lemmings (sticking to the numbers on the dice please!!) as you move along you must avoid rivers, canyons, forest fires and the ubiquitous Random Encounters which can be good or bad! However, you can navigate the terrain using Save or Play cards specific to each obstacle. For example, rivers can be used as normal squares if you have a boat, Lem Cardashian's floating but, or a Child's birthday balloon. Save or Play cards can also save you from predators such as the Lemming Chainsaw Massacre which prevents you from being eaten by mountain lions, snakes, or being trampled by an angry bull BUT you can only use one card per one lemming (then the card goes back to the bottom of the pack) so use them wisely to get your lemmings to safety.<br/><br/>As you move around the board the risks are greater AND if at any point you land on a space with another teams lemming you must battle it out for territory by rolling one die each, the one with the least has to move back the number they rolled, but beware of landing on Random Encounters and other Lemmings because you must keep going until you are safe.<br/><br/>The game builds in tension as the players begin to reach their new home because you are now in a position where you don&rsquo;t have the option to choose which lemming you move, beware friends and family as you get closer to winning they might have a mean streak you didn&rsquo;t know about and use a Save or Play card against another player.<br/><br/>This board game pits you against your family and friends in a fun but strategic game, it&rsquo;s your job to know which Lemming to move and when to strike in order to get home first. As the game progresses the stakes are higher - Lemmy is counting on you!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Rather than maneuvering into an engagement, units maneuver within the engagement.  The game makes no attempt to simulate the myriad minutiae of a Napoleonic battle but rather focuses on a compact nucleus of primary details essential to the period.  This gives the game flavor without overwhelming the main ingredient, fun.<br/><br/>The battlefield consists of a series of terrain cards upon which either randomly selected or purchased units maneuver and fight.<br/><br/>Commanders may be chosen from a historically rated list or randomly created.<br/><br/>A wide variety of unit types have their own combat ratings that are representative of the parent nation.  Stats for France, Britain, Russia, Prussia and Austria are included.<br/><br/>Each game assumes the starting point of 2 armies which have made contact.  To win, simply clear the enemy from one of three separate lanes. Numerous modifiers reward support and combined arms among other things.<br/><br/>Combat is based on a 2D10/100 percentile engine that first determines if you hit and then determines the effect which can include: disorder, rout, or elimination.<br/><br/>Optional rules include random events and more.<br/><br/>With less than 6 pages of rules and a readily graspable system, you will be commanding an army in no time!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You and your partner have recently met and are about to go on the romantic journey of a lifetime by building a path toward happily ever after. However, every relationship is filled with good and bad times: arguments, tears, shared success, and smiles. Happily ever after or heartache, see which one the dice of fates has in store for you.<br/><br/>Till Dice Do Us Part is a 2 player game with both a cooperative and competitive mode. You begin on the &quot;meet&quot; hex with your partner and are attempting to reach &ldquo;happily ever after&rdquo; by laying journey markers. Along the way, you journey will wind and twist to accomplish 3 or 6 benchmarks. This is done by building your journey though the benchmark icons. Once you have accomplished all the benchmarks, you are ready to get your happily ever after.<br/><br/>Throughout the journey and gameplay, you will encounter life and relationship events that can help you work toward happily ever after or create new obstacles on the path. These can be simple problems (what&rsquo;s for dinner, total your car, TV betrayal, etc.) or helpful events (get a promotion, perfect present) and some events that can have either good or bad consequences (first kiss, start a new business, etc.) You can also gain virtue cards, which act as permanents giving free foundations, extra abilities, and more. The game is played with a unique dice mechanism. After rolling two die, you may choose to either collect an outcome based off each individual number, or combine the numbers to trigger events.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It may be from the 60s or early 70s.<br/><br/>Although the game is basically a normal roll-and-move game with event spaces, there are a few things setting it apart. First, instead of racing from start to goal, you go around a circuit five times. Second, two dice are used to move. Third, there is player elimination, but players can only be eliminated in pairs, meaning the effect on the outcome is quite different depending on whether the player count is 2 (game ends), 3 (remaining player wins) or 4 (remaining players continue and may or may not also be eliminated).<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Resa genom Sverige is a roll-and-move game themed as a journey through Sweden. It is clearly an adaptation of Reise durch Nord- und Mitteldeutschland from the same publisher, which is estimated to have been published in the 1950s.<br/><br/>As in its German counterpart, there are two sides to the board, showing northern and southern Sweden, each one a separate game. When landing on town spaces, players read interesting facts from separate sheets, then follow instructions in the rules. These include the old standbys of losing a turn or moving a number of spaces forward or back, but also instructions to pay coins (which presumably have been distributed before the game) to a pot.<br/><br/>There is a reference to dividing this pot after finishing the game, but the actual specifications are missing. (In the German game first place gets half, second place gets a third, third place gets the remainder.) Also, as in the German game, there's no special significance given to the result.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The Thompson Trophy races at the National Air Races events were the premiere closed-course pylon racing events in the nation during the 1930s.  It was the Indianapolis 500 of air racing, drawing hundreds of thousands of fans to watch the best air racers of the era put their planes through the paces.<br/><br/>Classic Air Racing: Thompson Trophy Air Racing 1930-1939 can take you back to the thrilling sport of 1930s air racing!!  This game is a table top, performance-based simulation of Thompson Trophy air racing in the 1930s.  The game is based on the historical performance of each pilot and plane that flew in the 10 Thompson Trophy races from 1930 through 1939.  Rules and procedures provide a simulation of flying around the closed pylon courses that were used in these races.<br/><br/>The game document in the Files section includes historical background on the Thompson Trophy series, rules and procedures for performing the races, performance values for each pilot and plane in each race, graphic images of planes that flew in the historical races that are used as counters for game play, map sheets with hex grids that reflect the various closed courses used in the series of races, counters and markers for keeping track of each competitor&rsquo;s race status, and Plane Control Panels for each plane in the race.<br/><br/>Game components can be printed from the game document, and instructions are provided for assembling the map sheets to provide the courses used for each race in the series.  Everything needed to play the game is included in the game document in the files section, except for two ten-sided dice.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A part of Operation Market Garden happened in this area.<br/><br/>It consists of a game board printed on thin cardboard. In addition, players need 2d6, paper and pencil, and some markers and playing pieces.<br/>On a turn, a player can choose between rolling the dice and flying. When rolling the dice, the player places a playing piece on a field marked with the resulting number. If that field is occupied, the current piece can be moved to an adjacent field. <br/>Instead of rolling the dice, a player can decide to fly, taking one of their stones off the board and placing it on any free field. <br/>When a vertical column is completely full, the player with most pieces in that column scores points. When a player has placed all their pieces on the board, there is a scoring round, and pieces on certain fields score positive (village fields) or negative (war fields) points. After the second such scoring round, the game ends and the player with most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

In fact, each player must manage a microbial species, and make it thrive and multiply across the board colonizing habitats that can sustain its metabolism.<br/>Every species is characterized by a metabolism, a way in which it grows and multiplies. Metabolic features are chosen from a set of &quot;plasmids,&quot; cards that are picked by players at the beginning of the game from a starting deck. Plasmids belong to different groups, and choosing different sets of plasmids can yield different gaming experiences.<br/>During their turn, players can choose to spend energy for growth, to move, evolve or attack species living in nearby habitats. Since the goal of the game is to colonize the highest number of habitats, each player can tailor his/her strategy according to the special characteristics of his/her microbe.<br/>A player is declared winning when either is the only one left alone on the board or when he/she has colonized the highest number of habitats.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The first four are Humankind, Elfkind, Demonkind and Orckind.<br/><br/>Each plays with separate themes and mechanics, with the Humans boasting strong defences and economy, the Demons formidable in all facets and arenas, except perhaps at ranged, the Elves being naturally fast and good at ranged combat, and the Orcs are brutal savages in close combat, with the ability to generate a psychic gestalt from their collective energy.<br/><br/>In the first expansion, we will introduce the Slannikind and Rhudkind races, with the Slannikind being the Fantasy archetype for Lizardmen, and the Rhudkind the archetype for Ratmen.<br/><br/>After that, in the second expansion, we will introduce the Dwarfkind forces, together with the Undeadkind, rounding off the game's eight Factions.<br/><br/>The game is played on two playmats, with each Faction having their own playmats, and through the throwing of dice. It is divided into two rows for each side, with the row closer to you being the Resource Line, and the one further, and closer to the Enemy's own playmat, being the Battle Line. Players have to place their Units down on either their Resource or Battle Lines, but not in the opposing force's, unless otherwise stated by a special rule.<br/><br/>Every Faction has a Lord Card in your Hand, which is a superpowered Unit that if defeated, leads to the destruction of your army. Every Unit has six Stats, Cost, Attack, Defence, Health, Initiative and Leadership. To resolve combat and other actions in this game, you will need to roll dice, usually three times, first for Engagement, to see who attacks first, second to see the damage done for the side that attacks first, then to see the damage done by the defending party. If this is insufficient to decide who wins the combat, the losing side has to roll a Morale Check with their Leadership roll. That is in essence the game, although there are other aspects not covered like Spellcasting Magic, Flying and Mounted.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The phrase &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so gay!&rdquo; has been used mostly in a negative context for decades. Some people use it as a way to attack or vilify us, and others use it in fun, not realizing the damage it can do. As with the reclaiming of negative words and phrases such as &ldquo;queer,&rdquo; this game seeks to turn &ldquo;That&rsquo;s so gay!&rdquo; into a positive opportunity to educate LGBTQs and our allies, and even those people who would attack us. Words can be a tool of our enemies, or can empower us in our work. And this game hopes to break down stereotypes while having some fun with our LGBTQ history. There are the well-known celebrities and media sensations, but also obscure authors, scientists, athletes and pioneers. The scope of the game goes back thousands of years and across multiple continents, all with more than 2,400 questions that will tease you, taunt you, and treat you to some amazing facts. This game would be the most enjoyable for adults and for children ages 12 and up. It is best played in teams, but even two players can have fun testing their knowledge. There are all ranges of questions, so even those who think they &ldquo;know it all&rdquo; about the LGBTQ community will undoubtedly sometimes find themselves stumped. This game was created and produced by Tracy Baim, co-founder and publisher of Windy City Times, an LGBTQ newspaper founded in 1985. She has been volunteering and working in the LGBTQ community since 1984.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Wells Expansion works much like the base game, where one Traitor is working against a team of Warehouse Agents. For every artifact that is lost, H.G. will be able to search for pieces of the Trident. If both Trident pieces are found, the Finale immediately begins. Unlike the base game, if three artifacts are lost, there is no Finale; the game ends and the Agents lose.<br/><br/>What if MacPherson had stayed loyal as Artie&rsquo;s partner? Now you can find out. Not only are H.G. Wells and James MacPherson Adversaries, they are also playable Agents. Also included are Jack Secord and Rebecca St. Clair, two Warehouse Agents from the 1950&rsquo;s and 1960&rsquo;s.<br/><br/>The new Warehouse Status module increases the challenge by making things difficult for the Warehouse Agents each episode. But Mrs. Frederic is here to help with her new module, providing assistance wherever she is needed. These modules can be used individually or together and with either MacPherson or H.G.

The cubes in this game magnetically snap together for a modular and sturdy 3D board. Climbing to the top requires creativity, tactics, precision, diplomacy, and risk-taking.<br/><br/>Setup: Players start on a base of prearranged cubes. Each player is then dealt an even and equal number of the remaining cubes. Players are also dealt a combination of 2 unique player powers face down that can each be used once a game.<br/><br/>Play: During their turn, players build 2 cubes, move to an adjacent space, and roll. Rolling gives players a chance to reposition with the grappling hook (1/2 chance) or push all players in a direction of their choice with wind (1/6 chance). Players must perform all three actions once in any order to end their turn and may also use their powers as optional actions. The game keeps going until the player who builds the last remaining cube ends their turn.<br/><br/>Winning: The player at the highest level of the mountain when the game ends wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In British English, a city break is a short holiday spent in a city. City breaks are perfect for anyone looking to relax and get away from it all for a few days, as well as seeking out authentic experiences. City Break is about your memories that you are proud of and like to tell people about, and the roles you adopt when you talk about your past travels!<br/>You come back from your city breaks very enthusiastic and ready to share them with others. Your memories turn into posts on social media or face-to-face narrations about what you have observed, encountered, or undergone. You have to announce your adventures to the world! And you don't usually tell trivial stories!<br/>Who are you when you boast about where you went and what you did or saw? When you talk passionately about the arts, you turn into a Culture Creature. You are also the Royalty Buff who devours biographies of kings and queens and enjoys visiting their castles and palaces. There is an inner Happy Foodie inside you who loves mentioning unique and memorable food and drink experiences. Your social media profiles reveal a Nature Lover who marvels at the mysteries of nature and appreciates natural beauty. Only a Sights Seeker would plan ahead for trips to the world's busiest sights and landmarks. Your followers can't wait to watch live the Motion Addict who loves public transport, the best way to connect to the city.<br/><br/>City Break is a one-of-a-kind puzzle-solving board game specifically designed for a pair of gamers. What makes City Break truly awesome is that it manages to achieve an incredible strategic depth in a two-player setting. City Break is about adapting to new information, making the right choices at the right time, and solving the puzzle of the combinations of available digit-tiles, cards, and action tokens. The game gets more and more intense with each played card, while you have to keep an eye on your opponent's playing space so as not to be surprised by suddenly ending the game!<br/><br/>Players use cards to fill six columns with memories, creating narratives about their past travels. They need to make sure that their narratives are credible, so they must bring them into a state of equilibrium or harmony. The credibility of a narrative is determined by its 3 sub-columns of values. Equilibrium is when a part of your narrative is in balance with the other two parts taken together (for example, B = A + C). Harmony is when two parts of your narrative balance each other out (for example, B = C).<br/><br/>You pursue a diversity of interests when you travel, and you develop new personas when you talk about where you went and what you did or saw. Each of the 6 outlined columns of cards of your tableau corresponds to a + or = represented at the bottom of the 90 personas. Each persona has a combination of 2 + and/or = indicating the 2 narratives you need to be credible. + symbols indicate which narratives you need to bring into equilibrium. = symbols indicate which narratives you need to bring into harmony.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, if all 6 of your outlined columns of cards either have complete narratives placed on them or are disabled, your opponent gets one final turn. The game then ends and players calculate their final scores.<br/><br/>Your goal is to score the most Victory Points by assembling long credible narratives, developing personas, achieving target values, matching images, and earning titles. Are you quick-witted enough to deal with changing conditions, elements of randomness, and unpredictable opponents? Find out in City Break!<br/><br/>",

You can compete one on one or form teams and embark on a real intelligence fight.<br/>The game begins with the first round of cards (1 to 50 cards and with 5 joker cards) to be shuffled and folded on the table. Cards are drawn in turn, questions are read aloud. If the game is a team based, team members can consult with each other. Answers are checked by the opponent or the opposing team. After playing the first round, the second is played on the same principle (from 51 to 100 cards and with 5 joker cards).<br/>1 point is awarded for the correct answer. For proper performance of the joker's task - 3 points. For transferring a joker card to another player (or team) without reading the QR code - 0 points. After scanning the QR code of a missed task, 1 point is deducted. The participant or team with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The cards can be used as a stand-alone game or as an expansion for &quot;Golden Mind: a great board game&quot;. Also, this game can be expanded with &quot;Golden Mind.

        "description": "This is a great social card game that will f**k with your head by using a hysterically tricky combination of colours and swear words.<br/><br/>Players take turns to flip over a card and shout out what they see. <br/>Depending on your card, you might say its background colour, its text colour or a swear word. Keep playing until someone f**ks up and is forced to pick up all the cards. The winner is the first player to get rid of their cards.<br/><br/>It sounds simple, but the cards use a psychological phenomenon &ndash; the Stroop effect &ndash; known to mess with your head and delay your brain&rsquo;s response. Players can&rsquo;t help but f**k up, sending the group into fits of laughter.<br/><br/>Once you&rsquo;ve mastered the basics, you can take the game to a whole new level with more rules, more strategy and you can even create your own rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Fully Automated Board Game is a fast party game based on robots, unionism, and achieving full automation. The game is for 2 to 10 players and features elements of diplomacy, bluffing, and a pinch of Luddism.<br/><br/>In The Fully Automated Board Game you will be able to play the role of a proud worker or a corrupt boss. The goal of the workers, who play semi-cooperatively, is to expropriate as many robots as possible. The objective of the two bosses, competing both with the workers and with each other, is to accumulate lots of money!<br/><br/>Each turn of the game is developed in seven phases and represents one month of work. During the month, bosses can hire workers or build obedient robots. On the other hand, workers are not obliged to accept jobs and can even go on strike, bearing in mind that at the end of the month they may no longer have the money to pay the rent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Primordial Jungles are home to the densest forests of Alboraan. Legend has it that this mysterious, impenetrable land was seeded from the tears of the All-Mother weeping over her people, slaughtered by dragons in ancient times. The forests are so dense that light rarely reaches the ground. An inextricable network of lianas and branches makes any progression hostile and laborious. In the shadows lurk the terrible saber-toothed tigers and immense carnivorous plants.Few are those who dare to penetrate this compact green danger zone  and make contact with the fierce tribes living near the ancient temples of their ancestors. But they are also the guardians of the black lotus, a flower with extraordinary properties... The Companions of the Spear know that this flower would be an unparalleled asset in the fight against the forces of Anastyr, but this quest comes at a cost. The powerful Tanit, known as the goddess of the jungle, reigns supreme over this trade and convincing her will not be easy. In addition, the goddess who claims to be the reincarnation of the All-Mother herself is waging her own war against the tribes who refuse to join her cult, and in particular against Karanja, her main rival.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Bone Swamp lies between the Jade Sea and the Dark Swamp. This territory is named after the megadons who have lived in this area for centuries. The skeletons of their ancestors can be seen above the stagnant waters and in some places they look like open graveyards. The region is inhabited by the &quot;Primitives,&quot; a fierce people who worship the All-Mother and consider themselves her children. The Primitives, also known as the Firstborn, consider the swamp to be sacred ground. They are also the guardians of the megadons, whose survival they have ensured over the centuries, despite the presence of dragons that frequently preyed on their eggs.<br/><br/>The region is inhabited by the &quot;Primitives,&quot; a fierce people who worship the All-Mother and consider themselves her children. The Primitives, also known as the Firstborn, consider the swamp to be sacred ground. They are also the guardians of the megadons, whose survival they have ensured over the centuries, despite the presence of dragons that frequently preyed on their eggs. Each tribe was born in the wake of one of these ancestral creatures, whose name it has taken. Over the centuries, the tribe watches over the offspring of &quot;their&quot; megadon and ensures that it matures safe from predators. The primitive tribes live in lakeside villages. The matriarch's home is always found at the center of these villages, where wood is mixed with the remains of the ancestral megadon's egg. The Firstborn communication uses very specific tongue clicks, which allows them to hunt over large areas and to implement their battle plans against their enemies.<br/><br/>When moving through the swamps, the Primitives use stilts, the length of which determines their social position within the tribe. To travel longer distances, they ride Kurdai, mounts imported from the High Plains centuries ago. Today, kurdai are found in most village enclosures but also in the wild, as they have become an endemic animal of the swamps.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, an unprecedented threat has been looming over the Bone Swamp for nearly twenty years: the Plague. This disease corrupts living creatures, both animals and humans. In its final stage, the infected become rabid and kill each other. The Firstborn fear that the megadon eggs will also fall victim to this terrifying disease, especially since some of them are regularly traded during the passage of the Great Caravan, in exchange for iron and precious stones... These extremely precious eggs are indeed sought after by all the caravan masters, to enlarge their convoy and ensure their prosperity.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Fun Game of Switch players are trying to be the first to assemble a full train by rolling to move along tracks and switch between the inner and outer track lines. It is a simple spin-and-move game with 'Switches' that can alter your direction of movement. When reaching a switch, the player stops and rolls again to see which track line to use to move further. It is a simple even-odd 50-50 determination.<br/><br/>The goal is to build a train, starting with an engine, then two rail cars and end with a caboose. The first player to do this wins. Building is accomplished by drawing the correct card (cardboard pieces) at random when the player lands on a &quot;Draw Card&quot; space. The &quot;cards&quot; are upside down. A locomotive engine must be drawn first, then the rail cars. The caboose is last, just like in the old kids&rsquo; story The Little Red Caboose. If the &lsquo;card&rsquo; drawn is not the correct one, it is returned to the draw pile.<br/><br/>This second edition is very different than the original edition of The Fun Game of Switch in design and components. The original edition was a &ldquo;spin and move&rdquo; race game with a small network of tracks and switches. Just about everything is different other than the name, box cover and the use of a (thin) train switching theme.<br/><br/>While it appears the original edition game publication is from the 50&rsquo;s (based on web info and artwork) this second edition appears to date from the latter 70&rsquo;s and into the 80&rsquo;s. The original publisher initially produced this game under the  Warren Built Rite Games brand but stopped after a few years. Starting around 1981 the Tee Pee Toys, Jessup Paper Box Co. produced this game and a few others under license with a few small changes to the box and inclusion of punch out player tokens on the game board rather than pawns.<br/><br/>",

Legends tell that hiding behind rocks, clouds, and the unforgiving force of the sea lies an island, an island that pirates call home, a place where dreaded captains spend their downtime trading in the marketplace, drinking spiced rum in the tavern, testing their reputation at the Council Hall, or mingling in mischief in the Back Alley.<br/><br/>Seek infamy and become the most dreaded pirate captain! Create a powerful ship by carefully selecting and managing your crew, do battle and plunder ships full of loot, and make a fortune that no living man has ever made! And when you're tired, come back to the only land you feel is safe for you to rest and get ready for your next adventure. What treasures will you find? How many ships will you capture? Will your crew look up to you or start a mutiny? Will the sound of your name bring fear? There&rsquo;s only one way to find out...<br/><br/>Back O' Beyond is a highly thematic mid-weight 2-4 player euro game that takes around 30 minutes per player to complete. In the game, you take the role of a pirate captain, and your goal is to become the most renowned pirate, that is, the one with the most prestige points.<br/><br/>The game is played over five rounds, and each round consists of three phases. To start, new contracts that pirates compete over are revealed, the tavern is filled with potential crew, ships that can be captured arrive, and players repair or upgrade their ships...and possibly sabotage others. Next, by using a dice-based combat system, players attempt to plunder trading ships to gather precious loot and raise their dread, morale, reputation, and (most importantly) infamy. To end the round, players decide who to keep or dismiss from their crew through the power of food, morale, and rum.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Moving Castle is an abstract board game, reminiscent of Chess, where there are two goals, the first to Capture the rival Moving Castle, or to reach the Opponent's Starting Rank with your Moving Castle. The Moving Castle Moves like a King in Chess, but has an area of Influence equal to a Queen. Pieces that lie within that range gain Special Effects, powers that improve and allow them to do greater things.<br/><br/>The Moving Castle itself has two Lives, a Piece that Captures its first Life is immediately destroyed instead. A Turn consists of Moving two separate Pieces, then Moving the Moving Castle.<br/><br/>There are also three States: Aggressive, Passive, Passive-Aggressive. For Aggressive, you are forced to Move a single Piece twice, and are required to Capture with the second Move. You may not Capture the Moving Castle using Aggressive State. Passive is the default State, the only &quot;power&quot; is to allow a single Movement in a Turn, instead of two Actions. Passive-Aggressive is the most interesting one, basically in exchange for not Moving, whenever an Opponent Piece comes into range of your Piece in this State, it automatically Captures, as a free Move. This might mean however, your Piece is forced to lure out.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

But that's without counting on the observation of this legendary war by the Mystics, who choose no side and simply watch, impassive.<br/><br/>Hybris, Twilight in Olympus is an epic game of area control for 2 to 6 players, scheduled for crowdfunding in 2024.<br/><br/>The game is played in 10 rounds, corresponding to the 10-year siege of Troy. During a turn, each player secretly programs his actions through his own game system:<br/><br/><br/>     The Achaeans program their actions using a card system<br/>     The Trojans program their actions using a worker placement system.<br/>     The Mystics program the potential actions of the other two players!<br/><br/><br/>The action phase then starts, with the Achaean player revealing his first card, then spending a time value to carry out his action. The other players will use the Achaean's time value to carry out their actions.<br/><br/>The Achaeans win if Troy falls, either by breaking the wall, stealing the nyx eye, or if Troy falls economically before the 10 turns.<br/>Trojans win if they survive 10 turns.<br/>Mystics win if they achieve their secret objectives before either of the other two players win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Your objective is no less than to take over the world! Peppered with biting black humor, Comploty is the world's first board game based on conspiracy theories that actually exist.<br/><br/>You'll get to know more than one hundred conspiracy theories, from investigative revelations to creative pipe dreams to totally whacked-out and red-hot dangerous narratives, from the QAnon movement to chemtrails to the secret Nazi stronghold in Antarctica. Look forward to the most important facts, the most curious claims, and the funniest anecdotes from the fascinating, dark, and bizarre world of conspiracy myths. They will be conveyed to you in a nutshell whenever you draw a Factcheck card.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, you'll recruit the most ruthless henchmen and occupy the most important key positions in research, economy, media and politics with your allies. You'll stock up on secret weapons and sabotage your opponent's plans with attacks and other nasty means. You'll forge devious conspiracy plots of enormous proportions that, if successful, can decide everything at once. You'll acquire psychic abilities with which you'll be able to manipulate your own or your opponents' moves.<br/><br/>Of course, you'll also have to cope with one or another setback when the investigative journalists and mainstream scientists get on your nerves with annoying fact checks or your opponents slow you down with acts of sabotage. The last player standing after this thrilling showdown wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Forward Defense '85 is a solitaire tactical tabletop wargame where the player leads a company-sized NATO element in a hypothetical, realistic WW3. Forward Defense '85 simulates the fast, ultra high-intensity battles that would have been expected in the opening phase of a Cold War gone hot. Game mechanics are built to reflect the AI using actual Soviet doctrine versus a more nimble, but dramatically outnumbered, NATO player.<br/><br/>The experience of your units, terrain, your objectives, and the balance of the overall campaign affect each and every procedurally-generated battle in the campaign. Every decision matters and requires you to value your resources: Is it worth holding that town and securing at tactical victory? Or is it wiser to withdraw your best armor platoon to fight another day?<br/><br/>How the game works<br/>The conditions for every battle are generated based on tables on the campaign sheet - these are influenced by momentum (winning/losing battles in the campaign) and attrition on either side. Losing units makes it more difficult for the player to get reinforcements, while Soviet unit quality will degrade as second-tier units are brought forward to relieve their battered forces. Based on performance, the player gets supply dice prior to each battle - these can be used to call in replacements, get air support, or attach additional platoons from friendly forces. Loses can often be replaced, but the replacements will lack the experience your surviving units build through surviving battles. Unit quality (experience/training/morale) is a key factor providing bonuses in several different ways.<br/><br/>Battles can place the player on the attack or in a defensive position, aiming to overcome numerically superior Soviet forces. The Soviets will use their mass to attempt to break through your lines, while the player must maneuver carefully to use (generally) superior units and clever tactics to win. Units operate at the platoon level, with losses tracked by each individual vehicle. Combat is D20-based, with attacks rolling to hit, then rolling to destroy, enemy vehicles. Dismounted infantry, following doctrine of the time, operate with their transport vehicles and provide bonuses to them while not suppressed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Phoenix Farm is an adorable Dice-Rolling Euro-Style game of Competitive Nurturing for 2-6 players! Like the age old fable of Rumpelstiltskin, players are given a shanty farmstead, a broom, and a box of glittering ashes, then given the daunting task of turning these materials into a wealth of gold! Each turn, you'll have opportunities to: improve your farmstead, shop for farming supplies, or tend to your firebirds. By developing as a Phoenix Farmer, you will earn more wealth each turn until you can afford to purchase luxurious gold coins with your excess profits!<br/><br/>The catch to this game is that there's only x21 gold coins available to buy. When the last coin is purchased the game ends immediately! Players are then judged on: How much wealth they accumulated in gold coins and how well they tended to their flock of phoenixes. Only the most nurturing AND profitable farmer will win the game! Do you have the passion and the strategy necessary to rise above the ashes of your competitors? Try your hand in this year's Phoenix Farming competition to find out!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To accomplish this, Pomme&rsquo;s founders worked together to build the legendary Airship Kai, imbuing it with the best knowledge from all nine animal species. Sharing the ship&rsquo;s powers and speed, each kingdom established its foundations. But one year, the airship and its Fox and Owl passengers journeyed into the far frontiers and were never seen or heard from again &hellip; until now.<br/><br/>As animals gather for the milestone tournament, the fabled lost airship emerges from the horizon, carrying Seekers from the Fox and Owl kingdoms. As if this reunion isn&rsquo;t reason enough for celebration, Pomme&rsquo;s Seekers realize that Airship Kai still responds to each animal species. The stage is set for the greatest Harvest Tournament in 3000 years!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Engage in strategic conflicts as these divine beings shoot it out amidst the Bardo, simultaneously siring mighty kings on Earth. These earthly monarchs carry the divine struggle to the material plane, echoing the great wars of mythology. In this intense competition, only one Pantheon will emerge as the ultimate power, as the Bardo brooks no arbitrators in the pursuit of supremacy. Your ultimate objective is to achieve one of three Mates, a Gentlemen's Mate by completing all three Ambitions, achieving checkmate in the Bardo by pushing your opponents' Deities out of play, or constructing the most formidable kingdom in the material world. If this proves elusive, your secondary goal is to outscore your opponent across six extinction ages. Victory is attained through dominating additional realms, fulfilling ambitious objectives, and employing cunning strategies to surreptitiously siphon power away from your adversaries. Success hinges on astute resource management, strategic planning, and calculated subterfuge.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If you enjoy scheming great schemes, toasting to the incompetence of your enemies, gorgeous art, and a lot of shiny foil, this is the game for you!<br/><br/>There is only one crown of Elfhame.<br/><br/>Each player starts with three cards. You will have a &quot;Hand&quot; which are the cards you initially draw (or steal) and a &quot;Court&quot; which will consist of cards you've placed face-down on the table in front of you.<br/><br/>As you play, your goal is to assemble your Court so that you have one Coercion Card, one Prince Card and one Conspirator Card. Then, with the Crown Card, you will have manipulated your prince onto the throne (where your conspirator will, no doubt, rule from the shadows) and won the game.<br/><br/>On the way to victory, steal, poison, and spy on your opponent's&rsquo; cards as you hide, shield, and set traps in anticipation of their attacks. Each game should take between 15 and 40 minutes, depending on the number of players and how lucky and/or vicious they are.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Doomsday Cult 2000, players take the role of cult leaders bent on bringing about the end of the world.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player secretly chooses a Doomsday date in the month of December, 1999 (play commences on December 1st, and each turn is one day long). From there, play mechanics are reminiscent of Steve Jackson's Illuminati: cards representing potential cult members (a/k/a Sheep) are dealt into a common pool in the middle of the table. Players in their turn use Influence to recruit Sheep for their Flock (cult); each new Sheep you control adds to your Influence, and many of them grant special abilities as well. In addition to recruiting uncontrolled Sheep, you can also try to convert (steal) or &quot;deprogram&quot; (make uncontrolled) Sheep belonging to other players' Flocks, or declare jihad and have one of your Sheep making a suicide attack on one of your rivals' Sheep.<br/><br/>When your chosen Doomsday comes around, all of the Sheep you currently control commit ritual mass suicide in an attempt to trigger the apocalypse. A die roll determines whether they succeed; the more Sheep you sacrifice, the better the odds. If you do successfully end the world, you win; if you fail, you pick a new Doomsday and start gathering a Flock again; if the world hasn't ended by January 1st, 2000, everybody loses.<br/><br/>The game is DTP quality, with the cards laser-printed on (pre-cut) heavy marbled paper.<br/><br/>",

Players take alternate turns moving one piece at a time from the start square and along the board with the ultimate goal of being the first to reach the payoff with all game pieces. Along the way are doors that must be passed thru using keys (card combinations such as a single card, pair, 3 of a kind, or 4 of a kind). There is a fair amount of strategy involved, and often times movements can be planned well in advance. Two of the major features are WHIZ CARDS (count as double) and BONUS PLAYS (additional moves) created by passing through a door. The two-player version is excellent for tournament play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quad Checkers is an abstract strategy game where 4 players move small discs on an 8x8 board, attempting to &quot;capture&quot; an opponent's pieces. It is very similar to the basic Checkers game.<br/><br/>On each turn, players may only move in a diagonal direction. If a player's piece cannot move to a square, as an opponent's piece is occupying it, the piece is instead moved to the following diagonal square and the opponent's piece is removed from the board (captured). If the following space has another piece in it, the aforementioned move cannot be made. If, in capturing a piece, you are in a position to capture another piece, you may do so until no further pieces can be captured. This is the only time multiple moves may be taken per turn.<br/><br/>Quad Checkers differs from the original game in that, adjacent to each edge of the board, is an additional 8x3 grid. This is the starting point of the playing pieces for each of the 4 players. From here, pieces move out into the main grid where the competitive play takes place.<br/><br/>The game is lost for a player if he/she cannot move or if all of his/her pieces are eliminated from the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bulls, Bears and Billionaires is a board game that makes winner a Millionaire on a short game or a Billionaire for a long game.  It takes making money and turns it into even more fun because you are buying and selling stocks as the prices go up and down.  And to help you relieve your stress, you get to yell out your stock orders and when you sell your stock you must throw the trading tickets on the floor.  The Bulls, Bears and Billionaires game allows you have fun while learn more about the real stock market.<br/><br/>Players roll dice and that causes the stock prices to change, sometimes just one stock price changes; other rolls cause all stocks prices to go up or down.  It&rsquo;s a game that test wit against daring.  Should you sell out now or wait for a higher price.  Or, if your stock price is down, double up the price by using the Rumor Mill but beware&mdash;stock prices can go down just as fast as they go up.  The game uses Good News and Bad News to change stock prices just like the real stock market.  There is even an &ldquo;Insider Trading Violation&rdquo; penalty to keep all things equal.<br/><br/>All stock prices go up with a Bull Market and watch out for the Bear Markets when they all go down.  Rolling doubles takes on a whole new meaning in this game.   One double reduces your stock shares while another doubles your holdings.  The game is a fast pace of buying and selling stocks.  It creates an atmosphere of constant participation because every move affects any and all players.  It doesn&rsquo;t take long to learn strategies to help you win.  Build an alliance with other traders to try and control the market or force the prices down on stocks you do not own.  It is a great game for the family or those more serious players looking for a real challenge.<br/><br/>",

What every visitor remembers fondly and residents cherish has been re-created on a 30&rdquo; x 30&rdquo; game board of Carmel streets and buildings nestled among the pines.  Players draw illustrated cards with the names of businesses where they must go to make specific purchases.  They map a direct course, roll the dice and drive through &ldquo;Carmel Proper&rdquo; to the businesses before continuing on to the site where the last gingerbread-style home, dubbed &ldquo;Carmel Charmer&rdquo; by the residents, will be auctioned off.  The highest bidder wins.  However, shopping in &ldquo;Carmel Proper&rdquo; is full of pitfalls.  No parking spaces can be found.  Fines are levied for double parking and pedestrians fill the streets, blocking the player&rsquo;s route.  A chance card may send a player close to his goal or on a detour through the beautiful 17 Mile Drive.  A wary player who catches an opponent breaking any traffic rule receives a bonus of $1000 from the violator.  Car theft is $5000.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Carmel Proper&rdquo; is a game of distinction.  The board itself is an artistic rendering that depicts the tiny city with accuracy.  The movers are handcrafted wooden cars.  The money, beautifully printed on real parchment paper, increases the quality of the game&hellip;and exquisite addition to any home.<br/><br/>",

As elegant and direct as Chess. <br/>2.

Like the strategy games, HexiMerosTM provides opportunities for alliances, betrayals, making friends and enemies.  Unlike Chess, a Sovereign may be captured and removed from the board.  Unlike the strategy games, everything that happens around the play area and away from the play area is part of the game.<br/><br/>The game of HexiMerosTM is played between six opponents who move their pieces alternately on a hexagonal board.  The player with the Silver pieces commences the game. A player is said to &quot;have the Move&quot; when he is in possession of the Token.  The object of the game is to be the last Sovereign on the board.  The players do this by placing other opponents Sovereigns &quot;under attack&quot;, in such a way that the opponent Sovereign may be captured by himself or any other player.  This is repeated until there is only one Sovereign remaining on the board.  The player who achieves this goal is said to be the last Sovereign standing and to have won the game. Each player whose Sovereign has been captured has lost the game.<br/><br/>If the position is such that neither of the last two Sovereigns can be captured, the game is drawn between these two players.  The other players have still lost the game.<br/><br/>",

The first player to get a full set of one of each type of card and yell &quot;ORBIT&quot; wins the game.<br/><br/>There is no copyright or release date on the game, but it dates from the late 1950s or very early 1960s.

        "description": "A game of trading on the Silk Road. Each player is a merchant who travels from city to city buying and selling ten different goods in an effort to turn their starting 20 units of money into 10,000.<br/><br/>The map is divided into nine regions each of which has a &quot;price index&quot; which is tracked on a erasable tile. Each merchant has a sliding paper device which lets them easily look up the current price of each good for a given price index. After buying goods in a region the region's price index changes, which may have unexpected effects; each good will push the index up or down depending on which direction increases the price for that good, but all purchase effects in a region are added together to produce the final effect. And, since the index determines the prices for all goods, buying one good can cause the prices of all ten goods to change. Selling goods has the same effect, applied in the opposite direction.<br/><br/>The game represents the limited communication of the era by only letting players see the price index for the region they are in (and then only when in a city). Players cannot sell goods in the same region they bought them in for two turns, so information inevitably gets stale. Players can sell or trade each other information as well as goods.<br/><br/>In addition to goods players can purchase animals, rent ships, and hire armies and guides. Animals let the player move faster and carry more goods; ships naturally allow sea movement and can carry an unlimited number of goods. Armies protect against bandit/pirate attacks, which are one of the types of random events rolled for every turn. Other random events can include war (guides help you avoid wars), epidemics, and getting married; marriage gives the merchant a family which does nothing useful, but you can sell goods for more money in your in-law's city. Some events can also change the price indices.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Banana Republic. A small nation. Somewhere. Nestling between the mountains and the sea. Consisting of six provinces, each with a unique topography, character and culture. And each with its own REBEL LEADER, consumed and driven by ambition. A country struggling for unity after a long and peacefully ignominious colonial past, but, more often than not, torn apart by ethnic differences and personal ambition. Not to mention its neighbors, sometimes meddling in its affairs, and sometimes being manipulated and bullied by the Republic&rsquo;s leaders. <br/>At the start of the game each player is the REBEL LEADER of one of the provinces.<br/><br/>THE POLITICS: Invariably chaotic. Each province has its own REBEL LEADER, jockeying for power. The Prize: The Presidency!<br/><br/>At the center is THE PRESIDENT in his palace, attempting to hang on to power! His aim, and therefore the ultimate aim of each of the REBEL LEADERS: to become PRESIDENT FOR LIFE!<br/><br/>THE MEANS: Recruit soldiers, and arm them for those inevitable ARMED CHALLENGES.<br/><br/>Perform public works programs such as building roads, schools, hospitals etc. with the sole aim of buying &hellip;sorry&hellip; gathering tax-paying voters for those crucial ELECTIONS.<br/><br/>Manage political scenarios by means of multiple choice Monkey Puzzle cards.<br/><br/>And out of left field come Natural Disasters, sometimes with devastating consequences.<br/><br/>The game is a humorous simulation of the political dynamics of a small country. Not a deep strategy game, but certainly a fun game with lots of player interaction.<br/><br/>",

Based on the historic flight of the same year, hazards include forced landing, storm,  fog, engine trouble, etc.<br/><br/>Inventor was a flier in the US Navy and also made gliders and models.<br/><br/>Came out in the same year as the similar game Lindy, the New Flying Game by Parker Bros., apparently the subject of a lawsuit by Nucraft against Parker Bros which the latter won. This caused the Nucraft game to have a far more limited production and thus their game is far more valuable to collectors today. <br/><br/>     Not so sure about this interpretation. A note on the rules for<br/>     Nucraft's game Crash game indicate that Parker Brothers bought<br/>     the rights to the Lindy game from Nucraft. So it would seem<br/>     that Parker bought out Nucraft and shelved their version of<br/>     the game.<br/><br/>After the lawsuit Nucraft issued a different game called Crash, The New Airplane Game. It seems to be a Parcheesi type game played with three planes per color and a four color spinner.<br/><br/>Nucraft Toys ended in 1933 when the company started operating under the name of its founder Paul K. Guillow.  The company Paul K. Guillow did not produce any games.<br/><br/>",

Each player arranges blocks numbered 1 to 8 on their side of the game tray, keeping the arrangement hidden from the opponent.  Both sides then reveal their blocks; the lower number of each pair of opposing blocks in a row is discarded.  The next round continues with the reduced number of blocks.  The game reaches its conclusion when a player has been reduced to a single block or 6 rounds have been played.  The winner is the one who has the most number of blocks left.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is one of the Jamie Swise murder-mystery role-playing games published by Just Games. It was later published by Milton Bradley as part of their &quot;Life of the Pary&quot; line in 1987.<br/><br/>Episode: Mystery of the Mislaid Egg<br/><br/>Faberge: The Man and the Egg <br/>Peter Carl Faberge was born in 1846 and died in 1920. The Russian achieved fame by designing dazzling fantasies in gold and silver, set with precious stones and further decorated with brilliant enamel work. After winning a medal at the Pan-Russian Exhibition in 1882, his work attracted the attention of the Tsar. This ultimately led to the creation of the series of Imperial Easter Eggs. Faberge's eggs were first commissioned in 1886 by Tsar Alexander III, for his wife, Maria Feodorovna. The tradition continued with Tsar Nicholas II and his wife, Alexandra.<br/><br/>The Plot: Imperial Russia is about to collapse. Members of the Pahlov family, cousins of the Tsar, are clinging to the tattered shreds of Imperial privilege. Shortly after the Peasant Circus celebration, the family's prized Imperial Faberge Easter Egg was discovered missing. The family regards the egg as a symbol of legitimacy and social status.<br/><br/>The Time: March 1917<br/><br/>The Place: Petrograd, Russia<br/><br/>The Cast:<br/><br/>Vladimir Pahlov: Head of the House of Pahlov and disgraced military leader. Vladimir led 300,000 men during the Battle of East Prussia in 1915, but couldn't find a fourth for a game of bridge when it was over. He currently courts peasant girls and designs Petrograd's defense for the impending Red invasion.<br/><br/>Natasha Pahlov: Wildly eccentric grand dame of the House of Pahlov, wife of Vladimir, and possessor of the largest shoe collection in Mother Russia. Natasha believes that the shoes vie for social position and partake in scandalous gossip. As a result, the footwear is constantly monitored and rearranged in the Imperial Shoe Chamber.<br/><br/>Lord Peter Welthrop: Natasha's half-brother and second cousin. Welthrop has lived in the House of Pahlov for the past six months. A native of London, he fled to Russia after running his father's bank into the ground. Destitute and confused, Peter spends most of his time in the Imperial Sable Yard, poking the animals with sticks and watching them bare their teeth.<br/><br/>Ludwina Pahlov: Beautiful and manipulative daughter of Vladimir and Natasha. Ludwina has persuaded the family to adhere to the practice of Khlysty (Flagellants). Flagellants believe that a person must sin and repent before he or she can become closer to God. This belief inspired the Pahlov family tradition of the Peasant Circus. This bimonthly event calls for the humiliation of invited peasant &quot;guests&quot;.<br/><br/>Grigory Yamovich: Disheveled yet hypnotic mystic. Invited home by the adoring Ludwina, Grigory became the guest who wouldn't go away. Besides indoctrinating Ludwina with the nuances of Khlysty, he ensured his &quot;usefulness&quot; within the House of Pahlov by seemingly curing sickly sables through hypnotism.<br/><br/>Zudnyet the Dung Hauler: Preferred peasant of Natasha. Zudnyet is keeper of the Imperial Compost Pile and overseer of the Imperial Beet Patch. He invariably sits beside Natasha during the Peasant Circus celebrations, clad in sable furs. Zudnyet is often summoned to Natasha's chambers for late-night discourses concerning man and God.<br/><br/>Olga Grimach: Lady-in waiting to Natasha and a woman of true inner strength. Most of Olga's time is spent as shoe organizer for Natasha's sometimes &quot;animated&quot; footwear collection. When not soothing soles, Olga writes eternally senseless poetry for a lover no one has ever seen.<br/><br/>Tatiana Mikhapolov: Sister of Vladimir and chief rival of Grigory. Tatiana is constantly trying to drive Grigory from the House of Pahlov in hopes of curbing the family's slide into a moral abyss. She poisoned his tea, dropped glowing embers in his shorts, and pushed him out a third story window-all to no avail. Grigory loves the attention.<br/><br/>Game Includes:<br/>Full Plot Scenario <br/>Character Biographies<br/>Recorded Introduction<br/>24 Clues <br/>Solution<br/><br/>",

They were published as &quot;Life of the Party&quot; games; four mysteries and four murders. These are also copyright Jamie Swise Games&mdash;the designer of the games, who produced several other titles (and many, if not all, of these) a few years earlier.<br/><br/>Episode: Passion Cabana in Havana<br/><br/>Katherine Hobley, a pillar of Philadelphia society, was spending a carefree vacation in Havana, Cuba, in the spring of 1943. It seems she became involved with some interesting characters who frequented a run-down bar in Havana called the Passion Cabana. Upon her return to Philadelphia, she promptly withdrew $1 million from her bank account. She was accompanied by a rather disheveled young man, possibly of Cuban descent. Her anxious family has not seen or heard from her since.<br/><br/>The Time: May 8, 1943.<br/><br/>The Place: The Passion Cabana in Havana<br/><br/>Max Hammond: A 35-year-old man who came to Havana in 1940. He is the owner of the Passion Cabana and has a black belt in karate. The funds he used to purchase the club supposedly came from the proceeds earned form twelve years of bounty hunting in the States. While rumors link Hammond romantically with every woman who ever crosses his path, he actually lives alone with a parrot and a motorcycle which hasn't run in two years.<br/><br/>Harlan Standard: An expatriated American author of some of the most controversial fiction of the '30's. Standard came to Havana to escape the constraints placed on him by his sexual and political leanings. A New York book reviewer slammed his latest book by saying, &quot;Who wants to read drivel penned by a man whose heart lies in Stalin's boudoir?&quot; Standard lives at his Aunt Edith's compound under her iron-fisted rule.<br/><br/>Mama Lisa: The gregarious madam of the largest house of ill repute in Havana. On the streets, Mama Lisa is known as an angel of mercy to her girls and the island's most vengeful practitioner of voodoo to her enemies.<br/><br/>General Luis Beltro: The brutal leader of Havana's provincial militia who refers to himself as Luis the Eraser. He has gone on a one-man crusade of late, driving most gambling and prostitution operations out of Havana. Beltro is catching heat from his superiors. They feel he should spend more time dealing with the growing bands of communist rebels which ring the outskirts of Havana.<br/><br/>Maria Solez: Smoldering, black-eyed beauty who is Max's closest advisor and night bartender at the Passion Cabana. Maria is rumored to be the only person on the island &quot;woman enough&quot; to tame Max Hammond's amorous urges.<br/><br/>Edith Pitvay: The youngish dowager of Cecil Pitvay, the late sugar cane magnate. Edith owns a large compound on the beach which has been a refuge for struggling artists and site of some of Havana's more decadent parties. Rumors of a &quot;chamber of horrors&quot; on the compound have never been substantiated, however.<br/><br/>Marylin Desmond: A seemingly permanent fixture at the Cabana. Marylin is renowned for her ability to consume enormous amounts of rum. Despite the amount of time she spends at the place, this well-dressed and well-spoken woman has managed to keep almost everything about herself a secret.<br/><br/>Reggie Van Peller: The fianc&eacute; in search of his beloved Katherine. A product of all the best schools, Van Peller was exempted from military service because of a large monetary donation to a member of the local draft board. Devastated by Katherine's disappearance, Reggie let his membership to the Hubris Polo Club expire.<br/><br/>Game Includes:<br/>Full Plot Scenario <br/>Character Biographies<br/>Recorded Introduction<br/>Clues <br/>Solution<br/><br/>",

Deciding which pawns to move, you roll the dice and proceed to ride the KART bus to the mountain, ride ALL the chairlifts, and ski the corresponding runs -- SWOOSH to the bottom of the mountain! The winner is the first family to return its pawns to Ketchum after skiing all the runs on &quot;Baldy&quot; mountain.<br/><br/>While on the mountain, you pass through lodges and restaurants where &quot;LODGE OPPORTUNITIES&quot; happen. At lodges and restaurants, you have experiences typical of a ski day with rolls of the dice. For example, a roll of &quot;8&quot; means that you have successfully skied &quot;Easter Bowl&quot;, a Black Diamond run, and may move your pawn ahead 10 spaces!&quot;<br/><br/>",

The handle is then pulled so that new categories are revealed in the windows above each letter.  The sand timer is turned over, and everyone quickly writes down the name of something that fits the category and begins with the given letter tile.  Once time runs out, the players score their answers.  Players score five points for every player that did not put down the same answer as they did.  So players not only have to come up with a correct answer, they need to find one unique enough not to be duplicated by the other players.

No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.<br/><br/>ROCKY MOUNTAIN MAYHEM -or- Who Felled the Famous Female Flyer?<br/><br/>The year is 1937, and while the Great Depression is nearly over, whispers of war are in the air. Roosevelt has started his second term and the Golden Age of Radio is in full swing. You've just spent a week in the glorious splendor of the Colorado Rockies, where the warmth of the June weather has turned the mountains into a breathtaking bouquet of wildflowers, while the pines whisper in the wind overhead. As a guest of the Lumber Lodge, you've enjoyed hiking and horseback riding, painting and pottery classes, and just sitting on the back porch reading a good book. Ah, yes, the retreat has truly renewed your spirits. What could possibly upset the sense of serenity you've come to find in this Rocky Mountain hideaway?<br/><br/>But alas, all good things must come to an end. So tonight, come join your fellow frolickers, (many of whom are famous!), for a Friday night farewell dinner. It's sure to be a celebration that will live in on the memories of all. That is, in the memories of all who live to remember . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Wanda Munnie has recently resigned from the Rockettes and is on her way West to Hollywood. As a natural when it comes to acting aptitude, she's certainly destined for fame and fortune. Once in Tinsel Town, Wanda wants to wangle her way into the starring role of Hollywood's biggest movie ever: Gone with the Water. Languid, lovely and a little bit liberal, she always wears the latest of '30s fashions.<br/><br/>Sigmund Fluoride is an internationally acclaimed German doctor, famous for his innovative combination of psychoanalysis and dentistry. Best known for his &quot;edible complex,&quot; Sigmund teaches that a tooth will never change unless it really wants to. Truly loved by his patients, he goes to great lengths to make their lives more enjoyable. He wears his white doctor's jacket at all times.<br/><br/>Allison &quot;Allie&quot; Bye Riskie is a grand dame from England, world famous for such mystery novels as: The Man in the Burnt Orange Suit and, And Then There Was Nobody Left. Having amassed a great fortune as a novelist, she is often seen dripping with diamonds. She's independent, outspoken, and always in need of adventure. Though strangely enough, wherever she goes, someone turns up dead at dinner . . .<br/><br/>C.O. Pilate is most famous for having flown second in command to that famous female flyer, Sheila &quot;She&quot; S. Earbourne. An outstanding pilot as well, C.O. is magnanimous and methodical, and always dresses in pilot's attire. And while C.O. has taken a backseat to She S.'s notoriety, C.O. does have one claim to fame that even Miss Earbourne can't top - on a solo flight, C.O. saw aliens from outer space.<br/><br/>Madame Liza Lott is an exotic beauty from central Europe. Having come from a long line of gypsy fortune-tellers, Liza hopes to help humanity by revealing the future, a future she claims will never hold another World War. Often described as being mysterious and melodramatic, Liza prefers to dress in the costume of her native land.<br/><br/>Turner &quot;Turn&quot; N. Kafkaff is an Austrian author famous for his existential writings, especially his collected works known as: The Elongated Euphemisms. Most elaborate of his euphemisms is: Toast in the tummy is as good as bread in the belly, unless you happen to be dead. Never a slave to fashion, Turn tends to dress in a style all his own.<br/><br/>Hinda Berg is a daring dirigible pilot from Germany who truly believes that blimps will be the transportation of the future. That's why she's currently writing a &quot;How-to&quot; book on piloting the gigantic gasbags. Hard-working and disciplined, she's not afraid of the grunt work that goes before the glory. She prefers simple, unadorned clothing.<br/><br/>J. Ellis Mann, a columnist from a small town Kansas newspaper, is best known for his oblique obituaries. For as Ellis has often said, &quot;You're never really famous until you're dead.&quot; Ingenious and introverted, Ellis is usually described as being egotistical and eccentric. He is never seen without a cashmere cardigan and bow tie.<br/><br/>Emma Q. Wac is a doctor from New York who truly stands on the cutting edge of medical technology. A brilliant physician, Emma specializes in treating rare cases and hardly ever has a moment to herself. Famous for her bedside manner, Emma is sleek, smart, and sophisticated. She wears only designer dresses.<br/><br/>B. Iggy Mowth is a nationally loved radio show performer, who, along with his wife, stars in the B. Iggy and Windee Mowth Hour. &quot;Wise, witty and wonderful,&quot; is how Iggy is often described. For he's a man who is never too busy to frolic with his fans, especially his female fans. Iggy always wears the latest of '30s suits.<br/><br/>This mystery game is a spoof on the final fate of Amelia Earheart, though it's a much more interesting version than some of the more popular theories of the day. (She landed on an island? How boring is that?)<br/><br/>This game actually has a mystery within a mystery, and you'll enjoy the international cast of characters. Quite the convoluted bunch!<br/><br/>Also, the character of C.O.

No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.<br/><br/>Murder on the Millennium -Or- Who's Killing Time?<br/><br/>It's the turn of the Century, and you're standing on the brink of a whole new Millennium. What an exciting time to be alive! Especially since you've been invited to attend a very special Millennium New Year's Eve dinner given by that famous entrepreneur and inventor, Millford &quot;Mill&quot; N. Iam. Yes, Mill has invented a time travel machine and will be transporting one outstanding individual from each decade of the last century to attend this extraordinary dinner. Of course, the party will be held at Mill N. Iam's historic castle of a home, in sunny Southern California. When dinner is over, all the attendees will cast their vote for the Person of the Century. It's a party you won't want to miss, a real once-in-a-lifetime event, a night to reminisce about days gone by . . . That is, for all who live to remember . . .<br/><br/>Candidates for the PERSON OF THE CENTURY include: (By Decade)<br/><br/>1900-1910, Emma Rhymere is probably the foremost poet and novelist of the last century. Born and raised in Boston, she's traveled the country by train, reading her book of poetry, Moors, Mores, and S'mores, to the uneducated masses across the Western frontier. Criticizing the gluttony of the rich, Emma is level-headed and lovely, and wears the high-collared, lace-adorned clothing of her time.<br/><br/>1910-1920, Mia Curall is easily considered the greatest scientist of the twentieth century. Having won Nobel prizes for both medicine and physics, her greatest claim to fame came when she discovered a cure for Bigpox. She's often described as being methodical and a little bit maniacal when it comes to her work, though socially, people say she has an electro-magnetic personality. She wears the latest of post-war clothing.<br/><br/>1920-1930, Rich A. Phellar, the owner of Substandard Oil, is easily the wealthiest man of the twentieth century. Having inherited his money from his father, Rich considers himself a true blueblood. Though he's hard-nosed and hard-handed when it comes to business, in social settings he's refined and respectable, a true gentleman. Of course, he wears only tails and a top hat for evening events.<br/><br/>1930-1940, Scarlett Harlot is probably the most gifted and gorgeous actress this century has ever known. The original fainting femme fatale, she has starred in such box office hits as: It's a Wonderful Wife, and The Lizard of Schnoz. Scarlett believes a good actress should be demure and sweet, a thing of beauty like a fine painting or sculpture. She wears only the most glamorous and glitziest of evening gowns.<br/><br/>1940-1950, General George S. Lapem is considered one of the greatest military minds the US Army has ever known. His amazing leadership abilities, along with his talent for combat strategy, played a huge role in the winning of World War II. Gruff, rough, and tough, the General was raised in a military family and comes from a long line of Generals. He only wears army fatiques or his uniform wherever he goes.<br/><br/>1950-1960, Eve N. Louder is probably the greatest fashion designer of the century. But she's also the founder of Eve N. Louder Cosmetics, one of the world's top-selling companies when it comes to make-up and perfume. Rich, spoiled and eccentric, Eve considers herself to be the original fashion police, claiming her only real goal is to make the world a more beautiful place. She always wears dresses of her own design.<br/><br/>1960-1970, Blaze A. G'laury is an all-American hero, one of the first men in space, circling the globe during a top-secret space mission, better known as the Neanderthal project. Originally from Oklahoma, Blaze is a big, brave, brawny and brainy guy, who grew up reading science fiction. Not only does he have the right stuff, but women everywhere refer to him as &quot;Mr. Right.&quot; Blaze wears jumpsuits wherever he goes.<br/><br/>1970-1980, Polly Esther Pance is probably the most influential journalist and activist this century has ever known. Founder of The Save the Sasquatch Society, an organization dedicated to the preservation of Big Foot, Polly has been involved in sit-ins and shutouts, march-downs and walkouts. She only wears the finest polyester clothes and never goes anywhere without a hefty slathering of blue eyeshadow.<br/><br/>1980-1990, Wylie &quot;Wy&quot; Toukay, is considered one of the greatest entrepreneurs of the century, having essentially created the personal computer industry as well as the software industry that goes along with it. With an I.Q. that tops the genius range, Wy ushered the world into the Information Age and became a ga-zillionaire in the process. Wy dresses purely for comfort, never really caring about what he wears.<br/><br/>1990-1999, US President William &quot;Willy&quot; Groper is probably one of the more colorful presidents of the century. Described as having a dichotomous disposition, he's often charismatic and calculating, charming and crafty. With his award-winning smile, Willy is a real go-getter, a man whose cause has unfortunately, caused a few improprieties. Willy only wears clothes that bare a Presidential insignia.<br/><br/>This is an especially fun game if you and your guests plan to dress in costumes! Because the character roles span the entire century, everyone will be wearing fashions from a different decade. Hence you'll have Emma Rhymere in her long skirts comparing herself to Polly Esther Pance, in a pantsuit or mini-skirt. How shocking! The true gentleman, Rich A. Phellar, will be appalled by Wy Toukay's casual attire, especially at dinner!<br/><br/>To make things even more fun, the characters from the later decades will already know the history which the characters from the earlier decades are living. Plus, the characters from the earlier part of the century will be amazed by the world of the future, the world of computers and faxes and fast cars.<br/><br/>All in all, this game has a number of interesting dimensions that will keep your guests entertained for hours!<br/><br/>",

No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.<br/><br/>A Perfectly Perilous Pageant -or- Who Shot the Shoo-in?<br/><br/>It's time once again for the annual Ms. Medusa Pageant, a beauty pageant sponsored by Medusa Hair Care, Inc. for women of all ages. This year, Ms. Sella Konn, the reigning Ms. Rocky Mountains, is just sure she's a shoo-in. In fact, she's so sure she'll win the crown that she's planned a little pre-pageant celebration, a party that many might find presumptuous, to say the least. So put on your best pageant attire, sharpen your claws and come join the party. Then watch the sparks and accusations fly, because everyone knows, the competition at a beauty pageant can really turn ugly . . .<br/><br/>The Character Roles Include:<br/><br/>Rinah Plastee is a Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having recently won the title of Ms. Texas Panhandle. A waitress from Odessa, Rinah is a twice-divorced mother of three. Determined, dedicated and driven, she's sure her pageant talent of skeet shooting will wow the judges and make her a winner. She always wears her Ms. Texas Panhandle crown and sash with her elegant gowns.<br/><br/>Nathanel Parks is the dashing and adorable host and announcer for the Ms. Medusa Pageant. But he is most famous for singing the Ms. Medusa song every year when the winner is crowned. Charming, chatty, and chipper, he is a precision performer and claims to have show biz in his blood. For evening events, he wears the same tuxedo he wore when the pageant first started ten years ago.<br/><br/>Sharon Sharalyke is the reining Ms. Medusa. A native of Milwaukee, Sharon was originally crowned Ms. Urban Sprawl. She is a professional caterer and home-entertaining expert who now hosts her own cable TV show called &quot;Domestic Dazzle.&quot; Creative, confident, and capable, Sharon specializes in bringing back the abilities of bygone eras. She sews her own elegant evening gowns and never goes anywhere without her Ms. Medusa crown and sash.<br/><br/>MaeBea Shellwin is a telemarketer from Topeka. She is also a Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having been crowned Ms. Great Plains just months ago. Her talent of a dramatic reading from her favorite romance novel really swept the judges away. Sweet, sappy, and sentimental, MaeBea claims to be a hopeful romantic, meaning she hopes to bag the Ms. Medusa crown in order to bag a husband. She prefers soft, dainty gowns, and always wears her Ms. Great Plains crown and sash.<br/><br/>Dr. Tuck N. Liphte is one of the world's foremost plastic surgeons, sometimes called the King of the Collagen injections. With the right surgery and medical procedures, Tuck claims he can make any woman stunningly beautiful. Sociable, sophisticated and sardonic, he takes a personal interest in his patients' well-being and often makes house calls. He wears the utmost of evening fashions.<br/><br/>Taykano Priznerze is another Ms. Medusa Pageant contestant, having won the title of Ms. Continental Divide. A taxidermist by trade, she owns her own company called &quot;Stuffed with Style,&quot; whereby she specializes in decorating her subjects with sequins and rhinestones. She plans to use her stuffed animals in her ventriloquist act for the pageant's talent competition. Smart, swank, and sultry, she prefers sparkling gowns to go with her Ms. Continental Divide sash and tiara.<br/><br/>Botan Paydphor is the head judge of the Ms. Medusa pageant. As a former halfback for the Peoria Pigeons, a semi-pro football team, he feels fully qualified to be a beauty pageant judge. Slick, suave, and self-assured, Botan enjoys hobnobbing with the bevy of beauties who enter the pageant. He usually wears a tuxedo or a perfectly tailored suit.<br/><br/>Charmyn Lee Slick is a former Ms. Middle-Of-Nowhere and was crowned the first Ms. Medusa 10 years ago. Thanks to the scholarships awarded by the pageant, Charmyn earned her Ph.D. in Interstellar Communication and became a key radio astronomer for FETA. Tenacious, talented and temperamental, she recently became the fulltime Pageant Director for the Ms. Medusa Pageant. She wears flashy evening fashions, accessorized by her Ms. Medusa crown and sash.<br/><br/>Harry Medusa is the President and founder of Medusa Hair Care Incorporated, as well as the corporate sponsor and founder of the Ms. Medusa Pageant. Harry is applauded by women everywhere, both for the creation of his company's products and for considering the needs of his customers. Sincere, sensible and systematic, Harry dresses in conservative clothes.<br/><br/>Wiley Wheazle is a talent agent from Southern California. A man who flashes his thousand-watt smile as easily as he flashes his credit card, Wiley brags about being able to carry on a conversation with anyone. He constantly promotes his stable of stars, and claims to work round the clock, even while he's sleeping. Personable, persistent, and persuasive, Wiley wears only retro styles.<br/><br/>Let's face it . . . we've all been under way too much stress lately . . . And this is the game to take that stress away . . . Yes, a Perfectly Perilous Pageant is just good, wacky fun. After a night of laughing over this incredibly unusual beauty pageant, you'll forget all about the woes of the world or your work for a while. Plus, this game provides everyone with a chance to dress up for a night. The women can all wear gowns and crowns, which can be especially fun, since, let's face it, women simply don't wear crowns enough these days . . . It's perfect for holiday entertaining, especially New Year's Eve.<br/><br/>",

Of course, the focus of the festivities will be to honor the winners of the Barpha DeStue Whine &amp; Dyin' Contest, soon to become an annual event.<br/><br/>Provided, of course, that all goes well . . . For Barpha DeStue is sure to make a meal that is TO DIE FOR . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Toto Lee Smytten is the President of Barpha DeStue's fan club, the Barphalots, and has taken the club to places it's never been before. Often described as being &quot;driven,&quot; he prefers to use the word &quot;focused.&quot; For he's the kind of guy whose train only runs on one track. Meaning: He never forgets his priorities - especially his number one priority. Because he's often in the limelight with Barpha, he's always dressed so he's ready to help with any home remodeling projects, and he never goes anywhere without his tool belt.<br/><br/>Cherrie S. Ghubellee is a woman of many minds and moods, and can easily switch from being a serious businesswoman to a free-spirited artisan in the blink of an eye. She holds the title of Foods and Cooking Editor for Barpha's internationally acclaimed magazine, Existing. While always dressed as the professional, personally, she's well-liked and empathic, a natural team-player.<br/><br/>Hiram &quot;Hi&quot; K. Lesteral is a world-class tennis pro, known for his backhand as well as his passionate persona on the court. Both bold and brawny, with his professional ranking he can easily afford such emotional antics, having amassed a few US Open championships and having come so close to that most notable of all crowns - Wimbledon. Yet he does have one other claim to fame: He's Barpha DeStue's ex-husband.<br/><br/>N. Vee Ausse is a happy homemaker from Winnemucca, Nevada, and one of the winners of the Barpha DeStue Whine &amp; Dyin' Contest. Though she spends most of her time taking care of her husband and two teenage children, Vee loves to entertain and is also quite active in her community. For in her own way, she wants to make the world a better place for her children, and her children's children. She's often asked if she'll become politically active someday. But she quickly declines, saying she's not really cut out for life in the public eye, and prefers to be more of a behind the scenes kind of person.<br/><br/>Marin Nate' is a transplant from France and once billed as the top chef in the country. His credits include such items as having hosted a gourmet cooking show and writing a syndicated column. And let's not forget about his long line of specialty cookbooks, with such titles as: You Say Fricassaw, I Say Fricassee - I'm Right.&quot; Yes, Marin's name is synonymous with &quot;Mean Cuisine&quot; in this country. But after living the high-pressure, fast-paced life of a celebrity, he's decided to take things a bit easier and accepted a position on the staff of Barpha DeStue, where he can spend all his time creating culinary delights.<br/><br/>Borissa &quot;Bor&quot; D. Stiphe is a homemaker from the Hoosier state, as well as the wife of an insurance salesman, Reilly Stiphe, and the mother of their three darling children. She's also a winner of the Barpha DeStue Whine &amp; Dyin' Contest. It's such a thrill for her, considering she's a big Barpha fan. For Barpha's books and TV show have been an enormous help to her in her role as a homemaker. Thus Bor has constantly followed Barpha's activities, always keeping up on the latest Barpha innovations. And now Bor is so excited to finally have a chance to meet up with Barpha - up close and personal.<br/><br/>Tilly V. Isone is the wonderfully talented and innovative producer of Barpha DeStue's weekly half-hour television show, Existing with Barpha DeStue. Because Tilly knows just how to coax the perfect performance out of any public personality, she's played a huge role in Barpha's success, helping to transform her name into a household word. Charming and easygoing, Tilly often dresses in the same comfortable casualness as Barpha herself. Because everyone knows, life in the television world can be very erratic. But for Tilly, there could be no other life.<br/><br/>Ray Zhor Sharpe is a traveling knife salesman who supplies Barpha with all her cooking and crafts cutlery. Having had Ms. DeStue on his client list for many years now, Ray has always been highly dependable in providing her with the finest cutlery in the business - something that's terribly important to one who has such a great need for knives as Barpha. Personally, Ray is a no-frills, old-fashioned kind of guy, who works hard to support his family.<br/><br/>This mystery is a parody on one of the great home entertaining gurus of our time, whose name we shall not mention . . .<br/><br/>In comparison, this game is written for those of you with very busy lives, who still want to do a little entertaining now and then. This mystery is one of the absolute easiest games to host! Ordering pizza to be delivered is actually written into the game, and to decorate for the party, we recommend using Barpha's suggested theme: &quot;Tools and Toilet Paper, Beautiful as well as Functional.&quot; Yes, after taping the enclosed poster to the front door, you may proceed to decorate your dining/living area with toilet paper bows and streamers, and add a few pairs of pliers and screwdrivers to complete the effect. Then, of course, as your guests arrive, you're supposed to act as though such a decorating theme is simply divine!<br/><br/>Yes, this is one party that you and your guests will never forget . . .<br/><br/>",

No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.<br/><br/>HARD DRIVE HOMICIDE -or- Who Offed the Icon?<br/><br/>Welcome to Sillycon Valley, California, and to the Boardroom of Snaphu Software, Inc., where you've been summoned by the CEO himself, Major Hugh G. Snaphu, to attend an urgent late-night business meeting. The reason for the meeting remains a mystery, though the Major did mention in his email that &quot;the sparks would be flying.&quot; Could Snaphu Software have slipped from the #1 spot in the hard-core software wars? And why did the Major invite his main competitor, Bill D. Phences, CEO of MacroHard, Inc.? And what is the secret behind Snaphu Software's meteoric rise to the top anyway, especially since, prior to owning his company, Major Snaphu had been an Airforce jet jockey, and knew nothing about software? In any case, this is one meeting that's sure to be murder . . .<br/><br/>ALSO ATTENDING TONIGHT'S MEETING WILL BE:<br/><br/>Florence &quot;Flo&quot; P. Disque, the lovely and luscious Personal Administrative Assistant to Major Hugh G. Snaphu, CEO of Snaphu Software. Highly efficient and energetic, Flo is a master at anticipating the needs of her boss, aware of what he wants even before he asks. She's gung ho and outgoing, and known to be gutsy when going after a goal. And despite working in a corporate setting, as a former cosmetics salesperson, Flo prefers the most feminine of fashions.<br/><br/>Bill D. Phences, now in second place in the software wars, thanks to Major Hugh G. Snaphu's meteoric rise to the top. Yet Bill is still called the King of the Computer Software Industry, since his company, MacroHard, held the #1 position for years. With an IQ of 392, Bill is not only resourceful and rich, but known to be ruthless when it comes to the competition. He always wears a business suit and glasses.<br/><br/>Harvey &quot;Har&quot; D. Riive, a computer software engineer who graduated from MIT before he'd even acquired all his permanent teeth. A true child prodigy, he is now Snaphu Software's top technical talent, helping the company rein high above the rest. Brilliant and baby-faced, Har is far too busy to find time for fun, let alone notice the change in fashions. Thus his wardrobe tends to be slightly outdated. As an asthmatic, he carries his inhaler wherever he goes.<br/><br/>C.D. Rhomme, the wise and wondrous Head of Accounting for Snaphu Software, who is highly qualified when it comes to calculating. Born and raised in Arizona, C. D. has always had an aptitude for arithmetic. Often described as being amicable and equitable, C. D. appreciates people as well as corporate profits. When it comes to clothing, C.D. is thankful for the latest trend in &quot;Business Casual&quot; attire.<br/><br/>Margaret &quot;Mar&quot; Keating, the marvelous Director of Marketing at Snaphu Software. Pretty as well as professional, Mar is known for her niceness, and sometimes considered too naive for the hard core world of computer software. But Mar often defends herself by saying, &quot;I'm only kind until someone crosses my path. Then that's the last stupid thing they do.&quot; Mar wears nothing but business suits and professional attire.<br/><br/>Sergei &quot;Ser&quot; F. Dinette, the Director of the Shipping Department at Snaphu Software. As a former United States Postal worker, Ser thrives on efficiency. But in his job and with his work load, efficiency counts. For as far as he's concerned, the Shipping Department is the pulse of the company. Direct and determined, Ser is a big believer in honest and up-front communication. He prefers to wear military-type clothing.<br/><br/>A. Leanne Baybee, the gorgeous gal pal of Major Hugh G. Snaphu. Yet despite her striking good looks, Leanne truly subscribes to the maxim that beauty is only skin deep. Unique, extravagant and known to be an independent thinker, she might be considered unusual by the average citizen. But she hardly cares about criticism from the mediocre masses, as she lives by her own set of standards. Of course, she has an exceptional sense of fashion, one that always flatters her features.<br/><br/>S. P. Anaugge, a computer software engineer new to Snaphu Software. Dedicated and detail-oriented, S.P. is determined to make a good impression, and not afraid to work long, long hours, sometimes staying at the office late at night when no one else is around. For S.P. knows that perseverance and persistence can bring great rewards, not to mention an early retirement. Wanting to fit in with the company dress code, S.P. wears appropriate professional attire.<br/><br/>This game is the ultimate in easy entertaining! In fact, it's the kind of game where you can call a bunch of friends the day before and put the party on the next night. It's written for food delivery and the costumes only require your guests to go to their closets. Plus, two of the characters, C.D. Rhomme and S.P. Anaugge, can be played as either male or female characters, so you don't have to worry about getting an even number of men and women. Like I said, it's the absolute easiest mystery game to host!<br/><br/>And because the setting is a late-night business meeting, I suggest serving the food on paper plates and using plastic utensils. The drinks can be served in mismatched coffee cups, since people in a work environment would each have their own coffee mug. To make things even more fun, I'd also recommend hanging a few pie charts around, showing the comparison between Snaphu Software and MacroHard Software.<br/><br/>Besides all that, these are some of the funniest characters we've ever created. Flo P. Disque is cosmetically challenged, and A. Leanne Baybee is absolutely . . . well . . . you'll just have to play the game and find out!<br/><br/>",

Your final destination? The newest playground for the rich and the ritzy, Montana's recently opened Roaring Rapids Resort! Not only will you enjoy the activities of the Resort, but you'll also be driven by motor coach to the grandest marvel of all, a sightseeing tour through the rugged beauty of Yellowstone National Park. It's all the rage! Your ticket to fun and frolic awaits you: dated June 18, 1925, when flappers were risque' and prohibition was the rule. The festivities will culminate on Saturday night with a private dinner party hosted by Rum himself. (And because you'll be dining in Rum's suite, you might find the laws of prohibition to be a little . . . shall we say . . . less restrictive?) It should be a night to remember. That is, provided everyone makes it through the night . . .<br/><br/>Your Dinner Companions Include:<br/><br/>Princess Anastasia &quot;Ann&quot; L. Retentov claims to be the only surviving descendant of that great Russian Retentov line. And because of a little-known twist of history, she is the last remaining heir to the Russian throne, daughter of Czar Frugalin Retentov I and Czarina Wautor Retentov. Having fled the Bolsheviks during the Russian Revolution, Ann came to America for sanctuary. As a princess, she carries herself regally, being a classic Russian beauty and dressing in the finest of fashions.<br/><br/>Dewey Kare, is a baseball legend who has redefined the game, being both a pitching phenom and a home run hitter. But being worshiped as a hero got tiresome for Dewey. So he recently retired, and has traveled to the wilds of Montana in search of a new adventure. Yet he never forgets his years in the big leagues, and always wears a baseball jersey.<br/><br/>Cassandra &quot;Cass&quot; Piajammas is a lovely &amp; luscious starlet, having recently starred in her latest film, The Monotony of Marlene. And soon she is to grace the silver screen as Valentino's leading lady. Which is no surprise, considering acting is a talent that comes quite naturally to Cass. After all, her mother always did say Cass was a little melodramatic. But she's also a thoroughly modern woman of the twenties, a real flapper. And like most flappers, she's opinionated, daring and slightly out-of-control.<br/><br/>Barry &quot;Bare&quot; Marquette is a Wall Street whiz known for his gutsy gambles and daring dealings. He loves the excitement of the market, with all the ups and downs, and the dangers as well as the chance to get rich quick. Born and raised in Chicago, he tried a number of jobs at home before finally going to New York to be near the market. And because he's much sought after by women, he dresses in the height of style, sparing no expense to look dashing and dapper.<br/><br/>Isadore &quot;Izzy&quot; A. G. Mann has often been described as a chameleon-like character, easily able to change and adapt to any situation, at any time. Thus he always dresses to fit the occasion. And because he's come to Montana on vacation and wants to relax, he doesn't care to talk about his work much - though he will admit to being employed by the government. Focused and determined, he's a hard worker, and never quits until he gets the job done right.<br/><br/>Stephanie &quot;Steph&quot; D. Rink is a prim and pretty prohibitionist, probably one of the most popular in the country. For her name is synonymous with sober. Often called Sister Steph, she's the founder of the Church of the Triple R - the Real Right Reformed. As a staunch activist and a prolific preacher, she's known to be quite vocal. And because she's always in the public eye, she's particular about her appearance, and often quick to follow the latest fashion fads.<br/><br/>Senator Vito D. Beale is a United States Senator from Illinois. A man of great power and passion, politics is in his blood, as he comes from a well-established and wealthy political family. Vito chooses his issues carefully and then fights for them to the finish. Yet he's also quite charming and cordial to the voters, and because he's got an important public image to uphold, he always dresses to the nines.<br/><br/>Mary Widdoe, is a strikingly beautiful and well-to-do young widow who just recently lost her husband. Now, wherever she goes, she carries the urn that holds the ashes of her late husband Ernie, for as she says: &quot;He made me everything I am.&quot; Her friends describe her as being wonderfully charming and a great listener. And as a grieving widow, Mary often wears black, though usually in the form of designer dresses.<br/><br/>This mystery game is especially fun for history buffs. Not only is the main storyline centered around Prohibition, but many of the characters are based (loosely) on actual historic figures. Izzy A. G. Mann, is a spoof on Izzy Einstein, one of the most famous Prohibition Agents of all. Of course, Princess Ann L. Retentov, is based somewhat on Annastasia Romanov.<br/><br/>This game also has some special features that others don't have. For instance, a few of the clues are to be hidden around the room, and this game includes an &quot;X&quot; that marks the spot, though I won't tell you where.<br/><br/>Costumes from the twenties are especially fun, as that was the era of flappers and men in wide-lapeled pinstriped suits. Also popular at the time was a train ride from Chicago to Montana, to enjoy the splendor of Yellowstone.<br/><br/>If you like history, you'll love this mystery!<br/><br/>",

Designed for a women-only setting.<br/><br/>PUSHING UP THE DAISIES -or- Who Grounded the Gardener?<br/><br/>It's September 15, 1942. The Andrews Sisters and Glenn Miller are be-bopping over the wireless, and women's hemlines are just a little bit higher than they were a few years ago. Sugar and gasoline and nearly everything else is being rationed while World War II is raging in Europe and the Pacific.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, you're at home in Phunguss Flats, Florida, a town that supports the War effort and our soldiers fighting overseas. Of course, the war hasn't hindered the activities of the Phunguss Flats Garden Club. As a member, you're about to attend the monthly luncheon meeting scheduled for today. As always, it's being held in the clubhouse, just up the walk and past the Sycamore trees from the club's greenhouse. This month's special speaker will be Dr. H. Orty Kulchure, local professor of Botany, who also served as the judge for last month's rose competition. Dr. Kulchure will be speaking on the subject of &quot;Practical Pruning, or Using Those Dead Limbs for Fertilizer.&quot;<br/><br/>With the motto, &quot;Our Petals are Perpetually Open,&quot; you might say the Phunguss Flats Garden Club has a long and lascivious history, one that's fueled a lot of talk around the town.<br/><br/>For all who live to talk about it, that is . . .<br/><br/>Members of the Phunguss Flats, Florida Garden Club Are:<br/><br/>Mumsy Worde is the President of the Phunguss Flats Garden Club. With her husband currently serving in the Armed Forces overseas, Mumsy has found other activities to keep her occupied and to support the War effort. Known to be as cultured as she is charismatic, she dresses in the latest of Paris fashions.<br/><br/>Barbara &quot;Barb&quot; Wyre is the Secretary of the Garden Club, and holds office in nearly every guild, league and sorority in town. Both pretty and openly opinionated, she is married to the Mayor, the wealthiest man in Phunguss Flats. Yet despite her privilege, Barb prides herself on having perfected the art of self-sacrifice. She prefers to wear dresses with large flowered-prints and hats to match.<br/><br/>Schyla &quot;Schye&quot; Sphinstere is the Garden Club's Treasurer, as well as the town's librarian. Sweet, shy and somewhat secretive, she's an avid reader of romance novels and is still waiting for a prince on a Palomino to whisk her away. And while she's waiting for our military men to return stateside, Schye is active in the War effort, keeping the home fires hot. She wears mostly skirts and sweaters.<br/><br/>Auntie Pausto is as famous for her pasta as she is for her petunias. A first generation Italian-American, Auntie Pausto is proud of her heritage. And though she works part-time as a cook at the Phunguss Cafe, her family remains her number one priority. Lovely and lively, she prefers lace to linen, and owns an apron for every occasion.<br/><br/>Daisy Flinger is the illustrious and affluent heiress to the great Flinger Darning Machine fortune. Never married, she lives in her mansion with a multitude of cats and claims: &quot;You can never be too rich or have too many tabbies.&quot; While she wears the latest of 40s fashions, she believes she is never fully dressed until she is adorned with diamonds.<br/><br/>Sharla &quot;Shar&quot; P. Knedelz is an Army nurse who is home from the frontlines, having recently returned from the trenches of war-torn Europe. Caring, compassionate, and comely, Barb joined the Garden Club thanks to her interest in the medicinal uses of plants. Proud of her profession, she wears her nurse's uniform wherever she goes.<br/><br/>Ima Gardner is a gorgeous and glamorous movie star who calls Phunguss Flats her home whenever she's not working on her latest film. Hailed by Hollywood Today magazine as &quot;the brightest star bound to burn out before her time,&quot; she is one of the most sought-after celebrities in America. Because of her fame, she absolutely, positively, in-no-way and under-no-conditions goes anywhere without wearing her makeup, as well as the most up-to-date, eye-catching attire.<br/><br/>Sister Celeste &quot;Cel&quot; I. Bett is new to the local nunnery, run by the Sisters of Incessant Anguish. Having recently relocated from New York, Sister Cel is thoughtful and intelligent, and enjoys a wide range of interests, from science to foreign languages. Though she's an outspoken activist for peace, she rallies behind the efforts of the Allied Forces. Of course, she wears nothing but her nun's habit.<br/><br/>All right, ladies . . . do you have a bridal shower or a baby shower coming up sometime soon? Or maybe a favorite friend is about to have a birthday, or maybe you're just looking for an excuse to get together with your female friends? Then here's your chance to add tons of hilarity to your gathering.<br/><br/>Part of the irony of the game is that all the characters initially appear so prim and proper, in their hats and gloves, as they attend the Garden Club meeting. It isn't long before you learn that these ladies are anything but prim and proper! Kind of like real life, wouldn't you say?<br/><br/>Costuming is very easy -- hats and gloves and dresses or suits. In other words, everyone can pretty much just go to their closets. If you like, you can play this game as a part of a luncheon, or play it in the evening with drinks and snacks. In any case, just relax and laugh with your friends!<br/><br/>",

Designed for a women-only setting.<br/><br/>BUMP-OFF AT THE BEAUTY SHOP -or- Who Waxed the Highbrow?<br/><br/>The Loopey Lady Beauty Shop, located in beautiful Looslypes, Louisiana, invites you to attend the shop's tenth anniversary celebration, a special day indeed, since some said this celebration would never happen. Especially after the beauty shop relocated this year to that old Victorian house in downtown Looslypes, Louisiana, a home once owned by Miss Meara Unkinde, a woman whose deathbed promise was to haunt the beauty shop and wreak havoc on the hair of all who enter there. Plus there has also been mention of some missing jewels, a decades old mystery somehow connected to one of the Loopey Lady's best customers, Kat E. Cauldhart. None-the-less, life goes on at the Loopey Lady. . as does the trimming, teasing, detangling, highlighting, low lighting, perming, and oh, yes . . . let's not forget about the dyeing . . .<br/><br/>Attending the Celebration will be:<br/><br/>Faulleen Sizzorze is the lovely and lively owner of the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop. A savvy businesswoman who has survived the ups and downs of the Looslypes, Louisiana economy, she's managed to bring her business, as well as her customers' hair, to new heights. Hardworking and headstrong, Faulleen is the queen of customer service, making sure her clients adore their do's. Hairdo's, that is. She dresses in the trendiest of fashions.<br/><br/>Gilda D. Nailson is the Loopey Lady's manicurist. But she's also an amateur psychic, as well as an aspiring actress who has appeared in the local community theatre's production of Edgar Allen: a Poe-trait of Fright. Giddy, gregarious and grandiose, Gilda is the ultimate glamour girl and simply adores glitz. She wears anything with glitter, sequins or rhinestones.<br/><br/>Coco Coiffure is a new girl in town, having moved into the decrepit old DeDaye home, which holds as much dust as it does ill-fated history. Mysterious, moody and often melodramatic, Coco is quick to change the subject when the questions are directed at her. And of course, she's a constant customer at the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop. She prefers the clothing of eras gone by.<br/><br/>Barri Bouffant is a beautiful and boisterous benefactor, a woman whose heart is as big as the hairdo atop her head. She is the founder of the Let the Large Lizards Live Society, for which she hosts a charity ball at her own mansion every year. Bubbly and bodacious, Barri is partial to anything big, including big jewelry, big dresses, big handbags, and of course, big bucks.<br/><br/>Teasanne Kombe is a hair stylist at the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop. Sassy, stunning and sophisticated, Teasanne has studied the art of haute coiffure in such high fashion centers as Paris and Milan. She recently returned to the Loopey Lady Beauty Shop, the salon where she first learned to trim, tease and detangle. Teasanne wears nothing but the latest in dark-colored clothing.<br/><br/>Ruby Redhedd is a ravishing redhead as well as a reporter for the local Looslypes Herald. Flashy, famous and fearless, she's got the guts to go for the important exposes.

Ruby is a regular at the Loopey Lady and wears only business suits<br/><br/>Flo Z. Frizzee is the shop's stylist who specializes in the art of perming. Big or small, she'll curl them all. Ingenious, elegant and slightly introverted, Flo is a whiz when it comes to chemical applications, and she's never afraid to try out the latest technology, all in the name of hair science. Often caught with her nose in a chemistry book, Flo dresses for comfort and not for fashion.<br/><br/>Harriet Hilite is the wife of the wealthiest doctor in town, and an active member of the local Gamma Gabba Gabba women's sorority. Refined, regal and ravishing, Harriet has an absolute gift for gossip and is considered a well-connected link in Looslype's grapevine. She is a weekly customer at the Loopey Lady, and whether she dresses up or dresses down, she only wears designer duds and her finest jewelry.<br/><br/>All right, ladies . . . need an excuse to get together with your gal-pals and have a good giggle-fest? Then here's the perfect mystery party game for you! It doesn't get any goofier than this one!<br/><br/>And here's the beauty part of this game. (And I do mean &quot;beauty!&quot;) This game is written to be part of an at-home spa/pampering party. That's right. For a really memorable event, we recommend mud masks, manicures, and more.

Costuming is ultra easy -- this is a virtual come-as-you-are party. Though the truly adventurous might consider arriving in cold cream and curlers . . . We also suggest serving appetizers instead of a meal with this one, so you'll have plenty of time for the pampering part of the party. This is a great game for bridal showers, birthdays, and just having fun with your female friends!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game.  No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner. Designed for a women-only setting.<br/><br/>High Tea at the Liberty Library -or- Who Toasted the Tart?<br/><br/>Ladies . . . It's May, 1955 and time once again for the monthly meeting of the Liberty Library League. This meeting promises to be one you won't want to miss, with plenty of topics to talk about. First of all, Nona Tumuch, the famous author who recently released that scandalous best-seller, Paytown Placed, has finally decided to step off that high-and-mighty horse she's been riding and join the Liberty Library League. Though one must wonder, what made her finally accept an invitation and be part of a group she has spurned for so long?<br/><br/>Of course, there will also be the final dollar count from last week's Library League Bake Sale. Hopefully, with the sales of the goodies from Cooky Kuttre and Meena Ann Moody, the Library League might finally be able to afford that statue of the famous Outlaw Jose Whines, who once called Liberty his home. Oh, and speaking of Meena Ann Moody, she's let everyone know that she'll be making a big announcement at the meeting, one she claims will impact everyone's lives. Hopefully she won't be pulling any dusty skeletons from any musty closets, as no doubt, everyone's got a few secrets they'd rather remained that way . . . SECRET! In any case, as usual, the Liberty Library Leagues meets during High Tea at the Liberty Library . . . Though this may be one High Tea that sinks to a much lower level . . .<br/><br/>Also Attending the Liberty Library League Meeting Will Be:<br/><br/>Priscilla &quot;Priss&quot; E. Dings is the President of the Liberty Library League, having been elected to the position for seven years in a row. The wife of prominent attorney, Wynn G. Dings, Priss is prim, pretty, and practical - the epitome of the high-society sophisticate. As an excellent example of what an upstanding citizen should be, Priss is active in many charitable causes and is always happy to help those beneath her. Priss dresses in the latest of fifties fashions, and never goes anywhere without a hat and matching gloves.<br/><br/>Nona Tumuch is one of the nation's top novelists. Her name has practically become a household word ever since she released her scandalous best-seller, Paytown Placed. Some say the book reflects the seamier side of Liberty, a side that many of the town's prominent citizens would rather keep under wraps. As an author, Nona is intelligent, outspoken, and always investigating the latest story. She wears suits of subtle colors, with a hat and gloves to match.<br/><br/>Hope Leslie Devoted is the Fan Club President for that most sensational of all singers, America's #1 heartthrob himself, Bobby Daring. What an honor for any woman! Hope takes her presidential duties seriously, and is instantly offended if someone speaks badly about Bobby. Dreamy, dramatic and determined, Hope spends a lot of time at the library, reading all the latest &quot;Bobby Babble&quot; in the magazines. She wears skirts and sweaters, and usually ties a scarf around her neck.<br/><br/>Garnett Jeuell was once elected Debutante of the Year at Liberty's annual Country Club Cotillion, an honor that landed her more marriage proposals than she could count. Now engaged to a handsome local businessman, Har D. Wirkenslob, Garnett spends most of her time planning the perfect wedding and shopping for the most fabulous home furnishings she can find. Sassy, showy, and sharp-witted, Garnett prefers flashy frocks and jeweled accessories.<br/><br/>Cooky Kuttre is an acutely happy homemaker, a woman who finds total fulfillment from merely meeting the needs of her man, her husband, Mete Kuttre. Like all really good housewives, Cooky is the queen of the kitchen, and just loves to spend her time concocting the latest culinary creation. She also brags about having a house where &quot;dirt dare not tread, for fear it will instantly be sucked into the vacuum bag.&quot; Active, opinionated, and organized, Cooky wears simple dresses and never goes anywhere without her apron.<br/><br/>Madame Fabra Cates is a clairvoyant who recently relocated to Liberty, after her spirit guides strongly suggested she move here. Fabra not only tells the future by reading tea leaves, but she also claims to communicate with those who have passed from this life to the next. Temperamental, thoughtful, and theatrical, Fabra prefers to wear wildly colored clothing, with lots of jewelry and a bright headscarf.<br/><br/>Gussie D. Uppe has recently returned home to Liberty, after mysteriously being away for six months. A trust-fund tot, her father owns the biggest bank in Liberty, and Gussie grew up with an abundance of riches. She is often considered the best bridge player in town, though she is also quite adept at Canasta and Charades, and many other party games. Tight-lipped, tenacious, and trustworthy, Gussie wears the latest of designer clothes, hats and gloves.<br/><br/>Luv Swept is a writer of romance novels and has recently moved to Liberty to research the tragic life and death of her long, lost twin brother, Adonis Studd. Luv hopes to write his story into one of her novels, much like her own numerous ill-fated love affairs have been the inspiration for her books thus far. Sweet, sensitive, and soft-spoken, Luv likes pastel or flowered dresses, with a hat and gloves to match.<br/><br/>",

There is an outer circuit with roughly every other square being a &quot;castle property&quot;, the others bearing various instructions (Monopoly-style).  The inner board consists of 10x10 lines enclosing 81 squares, twenty of which are castles in five colored groups of four.<br/><br/>You start with your Knight (pawn piece) on the Start space and a box of fifty stones (men).  The third box is the King's Treasury (bank).  On your turn you roll, advance the Knight accordingly, and then add a stone to the central board.  Stones are placed on intersections, as in Go, and mark possession of the territory surrounding the intersection.  Taxes and commands on the outer board are ignored until the Knight has completed two circuits.<br/><br/>The outer board has spaces with named castles; when you land there, you pay the castle's owner a land use tax of two to seven stones, depending on the castle (the central one is worth more, for example).  You own a castle by encircling it (as closely as possible).  You control territory by encircling it.  You can also trace a line across the board, which then gives you control of the smaller of the two parts thus created.  Capture is as in Go: an encircled set of stones dies if it does not have any &quot;eyes&quot; --empty spaces inside it and the encircling enemy.<br/><br/>Stones can be exchanged freely, so you could, for example, sell captured opponent stones back to him in exchange for treasury stones in order to pay a fine.  If you absolutely run out of stones, you can take some off the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on Chess, but with less tactical requirements of the player.<br/><br/>Players have eight pieces - six soldiers, a King and a Kings Guard. The player starts by rolling a dice, giving him a number that is the maximum moves that player can make during his turn. He may move any pieces he wants as long as their moves add up to or below the total rolled on the dice. All pieces move once for every dot on the dice except the King's Guard, who moves twice, never less, for each spot used.<br/><br/>This is played out on a chess board with a blue and a red team. Blue moves first. The objectives are either to kill the other King whilst protecting one's own (Eliminator) or just to kill every enemy piece on the board (Speed Eliminator). To perform a kill, your piece must leap frog another. If your piece passes over another - whichever team it belongs to - it is dead and removed from the board.<br/><br/>Each piece has a forward facing arrow on its head except the King's Guard. These show the directions the pieces are allowed to move in. The KG may move in any direction, but for the other pieces to change direction, the directional dice (which tells you which way to turn) must be rolled instead of the movement dice. The result of the roll must be adhered to with one of your pieces changing direction accordingly.<br/><br/>If a piece reaches the enemy's side, it recieves a cap that allows it to move in any direction. This cap is also a shield which can 'die' instead of the piece, should the piece be killed. If the piece lands infront of the King, the cap may be transfered, but the piece must remain in the direction it faces when the cap is removed.<br/><br/>A four player version has been developed and can be accessed from the link below, but email me at writer@philipstobbart.co.uk for the username and password before going for it!<br/><br/>",

Whoever brings back the most to his planet, facing natural dangers and the enemy's might, wins.<br/><br/>Ships come in four types: Astrobase (strongest, initially carries everything else), Fighter (fast but weak), Battle-Cruiser (medium strength, carries Laser Gun and Force Field Transmitter) and Carrier (slowest and weakest, transports the Uranium [NOT the Fighters] --may steal the cargo of another Carrier).  Each is rated in Offensive Potential, Defensive Potential and Motion Potential (which is also the Firing Range).  Laser Guns are immobile firing platforms; Force Field Transmitters are obstacles and may be combined to erect linear barriers (when their separation is at most 3 hexes).<br/><br/>Natural obstacles include Magnetic Storm Zones, Asteroids (fixed and mobile) and a Black Hole.  Combat uses a classic odds-ratio table (CRT), with possible results being destruction, breakdown (out of action for a turn) or deviation (moving the ship 3 hexes) --the aggressor may suffer as well as the defender, depending on the odds.  Collisions can occur but not on purpose (no ramming).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Game of Catholic Trivia has a very fitting title as it is just that, a trivia game about Catholicism. However, the creators have added some extra elements by splitting the questions into categories, rating the difficulty of the questions and tracking game progress using &quot;Bingo&quot; cards (they are referred to as such).<br/><br/>When a player rolls the game die, the result corresponds to a number on his/her Bingo Card. The numbers are shown multiple times on the cards in different colours.  These colours correspond to a specific category of questions including &quot;Famous Martyrs, Saints and Sinners&quot; and &quot; History - Pre Vatican II&quot;. The number also corresponds to the level of difficulty of the question, that range from Easy to Extremely Difficult. If a player correctly answers the question, he/she places a token on the number and colour that was answered. If not, play passes to the next person. A roll of a 6 is a &quot;free will&quot; where a player may select whichever space wanted.<br/><br/>The player wins with 5 tokens in a row, vertically or horizontally.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was developed on the heels of the Three Mile Island nuclear disaster in Pennsylvania.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the player with the least amount of radiation (identified in millirems or &quot;Mr&quot;) when the nuclear reactor is brought to a cold shutdown.<br/><br/>The players, in some ways, represent water being cycled through the &quot;cooling loops&quot; of the nuclear power plant in an effort to reduce their radioactivity.<br/><br/>Each player starts out with 180 Mr of radiation identified by Mr cards in 10, 20, 50 and 100 Mr values. Card hands are kept secret - an important feature of the game. Radiation is reduced by 100 Mr with each completed circuit of the Cooling Tower loop, the longest of the three loops. While traveling through the loops, the player lands on Operation spaces and Mr spaces. The Operational spaces allow players to draw operation cards which might help to reduce their millirems, cause them to lose a turn, or increase/decrease the temp in the reactor core. Mr spaces add radiation to the player's hand.<br/><br/>Player's may also draw operation valve cards or other cards that might help them to effect a cold shutdown on the reactor. Valve cards prevent other players from moving around the loop. The challenge is in knowing when to shut down the reactor based on what you know about the other players' hands. Of course, the possibility also exists that the core temperature will rise to a meltdown point, which will also end the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is heavily based on Monopoly (as evidenced by the cover, which says &quot;The Monopoly Stargame That Strikes Back!&quot;).<br/><br/>Players move around a not-entirely-linear board buying orbital stations and the like and charging rent (sorry, docking fees).  There are some additional ways to make money such as mines and special side tracks on the board.  Additional mechanics are mostly combat-related - players start with fighters and may buy frigates and battlecruisers.  Players may fight each other or the fleets of the Empire, which is a neutral party that moves around the board taxing players (although players may take their fleets over sometimes, apparently - the rules are very hard to follow).<br/><br/>The box says it can be played by up to 12 people, but only 4 pawns are provided (and fighters come in just 3 colors - but organization does not seem to be the publisher's strong point).  The components could fairly be described as primitive, except for the board, which is a bit garish but serviceable.<br/><br/>",

Their target is a super-weapon that lies beneath a metropolitan high school for girls.  When the students learned of their plans, they band together to fend off the secret invasion.  Players assume the roles of these students and use their cards to foil the alien schemes.  When all incidents have been resolved, the player who foiled the most schemes is the winner.  One of the player, however, could be an alien in disguise and might betray the team at any time.<br/><br/>",

They do so by completing tasks from the activity cards. <br/>The first area of the board shows a track consisting of spaces in six different colours. There is one pawn for all the players. Players take turns rolling the die and move the pawn accordingly. Depending on the colour of the space the pawn lands on, the active player has to <br/><br/>     mime or draw one of two words from the card and the other players guess what it is, <br/>     read a story from the card and everyone guesses if it is true or false, <br/>     guess if the other players will raise an even or an odd number of fingers, <br/>     write down what they associate with a word, and the other players have to guess. <br/><br/><br/>Players who successfully complete a task and players who guess correctly get to spin a spinner showing the different family members. If they haven't already got this family member, they take a matching chip and put it on their player board. Otherwise they have to gift it to someone else.<br/><br/>If the pawn lands on a light or dark pink space, players play &quot;The magical 7&quot; (trying to come as close as possible to 7 with two die rolls - the winner spins the spinner) or &quot;Spinner poker&quot; (betting one of your chips to get to spin the spinner twice - if the spinner points towards the family member you were betting on, you win that chip, otherwise you lose the one you bet).<br/><br/>Phase 2: Once a player has filled his/her car, he/she proceeds to the second part of the board. Here, each player has a car pawn. Players try to reach the finish line as fast as possible. Obstacle tokens and event spaces make you lose or win family members. If a player lands on a space that is already occupied, he/she can steal a family member to fill an empty spot in their own car.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the finish line wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.GamingReport.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.GamingReport.com</a> review:<br/><br/>&quot;Cyber-Sea by Delmer Esau is a new version of an independent board game for two to four players. Like the original game, The Fish Tank, each player of this game controls a team of soldiers including a ronin, a hacker, and three foot soldiers on a mission to rescue a genetic super fish. Well, rescue may be a little overly noble. Steal the genetic super-fish is a more accurate description of the game mission. Naturally, in the world of undersea warfare, the competition is fierce so killing as many of the enemy is a possibly close second game objective. The teams fight each other, while having to overcome locked hatchways, flooded chambers, and automatic guns. The game is available from RPGNow.com in electronic PDF format. To play, all the components have to be printed out with subsequent cutting, folding, and possibly even gluing required.&quot;<br/><br/>From the product website:<br/><br/>&ldquo;Infiltrate a Pacifica research facility with your hired Ronin and their mercenary team. Hack the installation computer net with your Fader. Lay down the firepower with the Gun-suit heavy combat unit. Kick ass. Take names. Then put the game away till you do it again the next day...&rdquo;<br/><br/>Game is available from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.blackpowdergames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.blackpowdergames.com</a><br/><br/>This game is out of print.<br/><br/>",

His turn is over.<br/><br/>Not yet decided: If the player does not hit the number on the card, but rolls under the number, the card stays in the game. The following player may then attempt to roll the difference between the first player's roll and the target number, where he also chooses a number of dice from those that remain. He adds his result to the previous one and proceeds as given under HIT or SHIT as appropriate.<br/><br/>If a player's TOTAL roll is over the target number his roll is ignored for progress this round. He loses points. The dice he rolled are returned to the available stock. Each Player has only one attempt per round. If the target number (or the target difference) is exactly achieved by a player then the round ends immediately and the new round begins with the player to the left of the previous starting player. If no more dice are available, or all players have been once, the round ends and the Player closest to the target number (the player with the last valid roll) scores the sum of all valid dice showing.<br/><br/>There are four different special cards.<br/><br/>",

Developed and tested for several years by leading aviation experts, Flight Simulator answers the need for more realistic ground training by simulating the psychological atmosphere of actual in-flight conditions.<br/><br/>&quot;As each pilot flies his cross-country flight, situations are programmed that test his flying abilities. By reference to components of the Flight Simulator, incorrect responses are immediately observed, analyzed, and explained. Greater insight generally results from group discussion of the particular situation.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Each pilot selects a flight course according to his proficiency level. When the Flight Simulator is used by more than one pilot, it becomes a competitive cross-country race. The more experienced airmen are handicapped by flying programmed courses demanding greater skills, and the point score is given consistent with the appropriate knowledge. A student pilot can compete with the private or commercial pilot, while all are fully challenged by the situations encountered.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The Southwestern area of the United States has been chosen as Flight Simulator country in answer to the Simulator's need for the greatest variety of flying terrain. The map-board is WAC scale, 1 inch=1,000,000 inches.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Each card has questions from one of four categories; &quot;The Real Me&quot;, &quot;For Love and Money&quot; (Tastes and Attitudes), &quot;Do Your Thing&quot; (Interest and Activity Preferences) and &quot;Let's Talk About the Scene&quot; (Controversial Opinions). There are also blank cards included so that players can create their own questions. There are 20 questions on each card, each with three possible answers. For example, the first question under &quot;The Real Me&quot; is &quot;I keep records of my expenditures; a)Yes, b)No, c)Sometimes&quot;. There are a, b and c columns on each card. Players use special hole punches to punch out the column corresponding to their answer.<br/><br/>When all players have punched their answers the cards are placed in pairs in the &quot;reader&quot; and the number of common answers are noted by checking to see where the punched holes overlap. The players with the most overlaps are considered to be the most compatible.<br/><br/>",

Once captured, turn the opposing spheres over to make them allies.<br/><br/>The Ta&iacute;no Legend<br/>Before time memorial, the legendary Ta&iacute;no peoples who inhabited the Caribbean island of Borik&eacute;n played an abundance of board games, most of them now time forgotten. Some of these games they played not as a form of entertainment, but rather as a means to more useful ends. &amp;quot;Moving the Wooden Spheres&amp;quot; was one of the games that were played in special occasions, and then only by the cacikes (chiefs) of the tribes. The game was played when it became necessary to settle a dispute between two tribes. It was then that two peaceful minds would engage in a battle of wits&mdash;for it was sacrilege for Ta&iacute;nos to wage war amongst themselves; although, they were fearless fighters when their small island had to be defended; as it happened quite often when the bloodthirsty Caribes came charging across the sea from their strongholds in the Orinoco Delta in what is now Venezuela. They raided the island repeatedly looking to slay the Ta&iacute;no warriors and take their women and children to use as slaves, but the Caribes were always driven back.<br/><br/>To play the game the cacike of each tribe was &amp;quot;armed&amp;quot; with eighteen wooden spheres, three of each of six types of wood. Each cacike would appoint a warrior to &amp;quot;move the spheres&amp;quot; as he/she instructed. (The great cacike Yuisa of the Haimanio Yukayeke was probably the first female ruler in America).<br/><br/>The two &amp;quot;combatants&amp;quot; would set the spheres at opposite edges of the batey (a plaza, used for tribal ceremonies&mdash;and as an immense gameboard when there was a need to &amp;quot;move the spheres&amp;quot;). The &amp;quot;movement of the spheres&amp;quot; would begin as the older cacike conceded the honor of moving the first sphere to the younger, less experienced one; thereafter the two appointed warriors would alternate turns moving the spheres as the cacikes instructed into pits (36 in total) dug out of the hard surface of the batey following strict rules of placement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Power Quest is an elaborate roll-and-move game with mechanics that will be very familiar to nearly everyone. There are elements here from backgammon, pachisi, Careers, you name it.<br/><br/>The vague back story has players controlling &quot;agents&quot; that move about the board &quot;...in your struggle against the odds to obtain money, prisoners, and position&quot;.<br/><br/>The square gameboard is printed with four concentric rings of spaces.  Each turn players roll two dice to move one of their three tokens - pardon me, &quot;agents&quot; - out of their headquarters on the outer ring and around the board.  Agents can be sent back to HQ by enemy agents, can form blockades, can fall into traps and be captured, and in general are used to make money and harass the other agents.<br/><br/>Most squares are marked with actions that kick off when agents land on them.  Many of these earn money for the players, either as a flat payment or by allowing a simple form of gambling involving the bank and the other players.  Other actions include: allowing movement up to the next inner track, drawing &quot;Fate&quot; cards that dole out random goodness and badness, starting an auction that sells fallen agents to the highest bidders, and traps that may be inconveniently activated by other players.<br/><br/>The rings get progressively more generous and dangerous as agents move to the inside.  Agents captured by an opponent's action (rather than a game mechanic) don't re-enter the game, so the number of agents in play gradually diminishes.  The game ends when only one player's agents are left on the board.  Players sell (ransom, I suppose) their captured prisoners, and the most money wins the game.<br/><br/>This appears to be a limited run home brew, but it comes in a sturdy box and the production values are good.  Both the &quot;Regular Play&quot; and &quot;Advanced Play&quot; rules booklets are well-organized and pretty clear.  Advanced rules include solitaire, partnership and a host of other variants.<br/><br/>",

Afterwards, the players change roles.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>Earning the most points by correctly locating the treasures while needing as few hints as possible.<br/><br/>Game play<br/>The game board shows an island with 15 connected circles. These are the potential hiding places for the treasures. Each circle is identified through a symbol and also shows one, two or three dots. There are also 15 cardboard discs corresponding to the hiding places (same symbol). The discs have a hole in them.<br/>One player starts the game as the first treasure hunter. He/she gets the 3 red markers and tries to find the three treasures.<br/>The other player shuffles the discs, draws three of them and looks at them, without letting the treasure hunter see them. These discs specify the locations where the treasures are. The other discs form a face-down stack.<br/>The treasure hunter then takes the first disc from the stack and places it on the corresponding location on the board. His/her opponent checks how many treasures are adjacent to that location and marks this by rotating the tile in such a way that the hole shows the same number as dots as there are treasures on adjacent spaces. This is repeated until the treasure hunters thinks he/she knows where the three treasures are. He/she marks the suspected locations with the red markers. Then the actual locations of the treasures are revealed. The treasure hunter gets positive points for location discs not used, and minus points for incorrectly marked locations.<br/><br/>Then the players switch roles.<br/><br/>The game ends after 6 rounds. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battles with Micro-Tanks Miniature rules<br/><br/>These rules are designed primarily to permit you to recreate WWII engagements, both small and large scale, using micro&mdash;scale (1:300) units.<br/><br/>The variety of combat situations which occurred during WWII was almost endless. Battles were fought in deserts and mountains, in good weather and bad, with a wide selection of unit types and equipment, and this era therefore offers the wargamer an opportunity to create practically any type of combat situation he desires.<br/><br/>Those rules will allow the wargamer to simulate both small and large scale actions, which retain a high degree of realism, yet are very playable. They permit the players to easily control the large quantity of units sometimes used when gaming in this scale.<br/><br/>The basic ground scale is 1 inch equals 50 yards, and the basic time scale is 1 turn equals 120 seconds. At this particular ground scale, each unit would represent from 4 to 5 actual units, and you may, of course, play this way. However, it was found that using a 1 for 1 vehicle/unit system works out quite well also. For infantry, one (1) 1/2 inch marker, or 1/2 inch base, with 2 or 3 micro&mdash;scale figures mounted on it, represents a 6 to 10 men squad. When an infantry squad is referred to in these rules, this is what is meant.<br/><br/>The equipment lists in the tables describe most of the common pieces of equipment used during WWII. If you wish to use others, it should be a relatively easy procedure to add them, adjusting their values relative to the other equipment.<br/><br/>When playing a micro-armour wargame, it usually works best when a disinterested third party is used to settle all judgment disputes. This will help the game to move quickly, with a minimum of disruption.<br/><br/>Another recommendation which can enhance realism, and can also make the game easier to control, is to maintain some form of unit integrity. There are many references available which can be used to determine the actual composition of the units in question. As a rule of thumb, you can use the following:<br/>3 to 5 units per platoon<br/>3 to 5 platoons per company<br/>3 to 5 companies par battalion. Other specialized types of units may be attached for a given scenario. As a minimum, it is required that you maintain at least company integrity. The farthest any unit can be away from any other unit in the company is 2 inches.<br/><br/>",

To win you have to make a straight row of five dots in five different colors, without putting any dot next to a dot of the same color. The row of five must be orthognal, not diagonal. Obviously for 5 places it has to cross at least two faces.<br/><br/>3-4 player variant too.<br/><br/>",

Players draw a card (from one of five decks) when their tokens land on certain spaces; these cards task the players to read out tongue twisters, news bulletins, and ad lib to scenarios.

With Grid Iron, you will not only be transformed into the Quarterback barking out the plays, but also the Coach, the Receiver and the Fullback barreling ahead for that First Down. You'll also get to make great defensive plays, like flying in as the Safety to make a leaping stab at the ball, or as the Linebacker coming in to make a crushing stop on the ball carrier. Grid Iron is an easy game to learn. Yet the combination of strategy, skill and luck makes every game played a pressure cooker. So if you can stand the pain, get ready to knock heads with the best of them for hours of fun and competition.

There are five cards each of nine different weapons of war: Airplane Gun, Tank, Howitzer, Mortar, Field Gun, Machine Gun, Rifle, Revolver and Bomb (hand grenade). There are 11 Camouflage cards, showing a camouflage pattern.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt one card. The first player is then dealt another card. If he is dealt a Camouflage card, he does not spin and play passes to the left. Otherwise, he uses the spinner, which has six results: 1, 2 and 3 places to the left and to the right. That player is the target. If that player's stack does not have a Camouflage card on top, the spinning player takes the whole stack. Either way, play passes to the left (dealing a card then using the spinner).<br/><br/>If a player is dealt a Howitzer card, he takes all unprotected stacks from all other players. The player with the most cards when the deck runs out wins the hand and gets 10 points. The winner of the game is the first to reach 50 points.<br/><br/>",

Children move around the colorfully animated board on skateboard playing pieces and discover that if they learn their ABC's and 123's there is fun to be had after school.

The game that isn't an adaptation of a card game is very similar to Upwords.<br/><br/>A Kidz Cardz set was also sold - this has the same deck and many of the same games, but removes the rummy and poker games and adds some simpler ones (one based on war, for example).<br/><br/>The background of the game is of some interest.  It was invented by Hannah Cannon, a 12-year-old girl whose father formed a company to market it and managed to get a fair amount of publicity for it - Hannah was interviewed on Good Morning America and got a one-page writeup in People magazine.  (Her father, Doran William Cannon, is a former screenwriter who seems to be good at promotional activities.)  It was supposedly sold in places such as Waldenbooks and Bloomingdale's, but references to it are hard to find now.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Murder is a somewhat unusual deduction game.  The equipment consists of a deck of (seemingly homemade but fairly sturdy) cards and a cloth bag.  The cards include a group of times, a number of opportunity cards (all identical), a group of motives (all with appropriate quotes, e.g. &quot;Love and murder will out. - William Congreve&quot; for the Love card), &quot;You Are Murdered&quot; cards, and 10 sets of actual murder cards, each set containing an alias, method, weapon, and place - for example, Archbishop, Ran Over, Car, and Avenue.<br/><br/>Each player gets a You Are Murdered card and a random assortment of others, and in turn takes a card and discards one into the bag.  The last player in the round takes the bag and can select one of the cards, discarding the rest face up (first player then rotates).<br/><br/>The object of this part is to collect a 4-card murder set plus a motive, opportunity, and time.  When you have these you discard You Are Murdered and the last player in the round becomes the victim when that card is pulled from the bag.<br/><br/>At that point the game shifts into deduction mode, with everyone trying to deduce which player was the murderer and what his or her alias, motive, and time cards are.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the rules go very vague at this point - questioning is totally free-form, there is no way to score (and the end doesn't come until everyone has the solution, apparently), and they don't address the issue of what happens if there is more than one murderer.  However, it may be possible to invent new rules to fix these problems.<br/><br/>",

After a turn, a player replenishes his seven tiles from the tile bag. Each side of every tile played must match the sides of every tile already on the board that it touches. Pieces score 1 if played onto a white square. The board has a grid of bonus squares. Pieces played onto bonus squares score the number of stripes on the piece played times 2 (blue), 3 (silver), or 5 (gold). Each tile has a red dot on one face, and must be played with this side facing the red dot on the board. The game ends when no player can place any more of their tiles on the board. the number of stripes on pieces still held by each player is deducted from their score at the end of the game. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Legends of Syrrith is a boardgame for up to 4 players, with playing time usually being 1-2 hours. The boardgame can be played solitaire, as a group or you can compete against other players.<br/><br/>In solitaire and competition mode players start the game with a single hero, one henchmen and a small amount of gold. When played as a group each player chooses a hero that they wish to control and the group works as a team to accomplish missions and encounters.<br/><br/>As heroes explore Syrrith they will gain powerful items, treasure and additional heroes to join their group. With over 30 heroes and henchmen to pick from, not to mention over 100 different monsters, traps, dungeons and encounters each game will always be interesting. As each players group grows in power they will be able to take on stronger opponents and harder dungeons.<br/><br/>Legends of Syrrith can be played by itself as a full stand alone game or it can even be used with the Shadow Wars boardgame. When used with the Shadow Wars boardgame, this expansion takes on a whole new twist. Many Heroes can be used in your armies and the items that your adventurers find are useful in your goal to conquer Syrrith. Heroic warriors, arcane wizards, crafty rogues and ancient items of power will be at your command.<br/><br/>",

The game comes with four dice (red, blue, green, purple), two player letter charts (in color), rules, and a pad of score sheets (which contain simply 25 blank squares in a 5x5 grid).  The whole thing fits in a box 3&quot; x 3&quot; x 2&quot; (7.5 cm x 7.5 cm x 5 cm) and so is touted as being &quot;for home or travel.&quot;<br/><br/>Each turn you roll all four dice and consult the letter chart.  The chart shows a result from 1-5 for each of the four colors.  The twenty spaces contain the twenty consonants (all except &quot;Y&quot;).  So a roll of 4 on the blue die gives a &quot;T&quot; result, for example.<br/><br/>If the player rolls no 6s, he must choose one of the consonants rolled and enter it anywhere he wants in the 5x5 score sheet.  If he rolled at least one 6, he may also enter a vowel (or &quot;Y&quot;) of his choice.  If the red and green dice = 7, he may use the purple and blue dice as normal (choose one consonant from the blue and purple rows) but may then add a second consonant of his choice.<br/><br/>The letter(s) chosen must be entered onto the score sheet - there is only one score sheet for both players, passed back and forth each turn.  Basic Scrabble rules are followed in the mini 5x5 board.  Every letter placed must be alone or make a word.  You score one point for each word you make.  First player to nine points wins.

        "description": "The perfect game to play November 5, Gunpowder Treason is a game based on Guy Fawkes' attempt to blow up Parliament in 1605.  This in itself is a little spooky, but what's really spooky is that the box says that Aztral Games designed it for Astra Fireworks Company in the UK!<br/><br/>It's a fairly simple game: move one space on your turn and possibly draw a card.  The object is to be the first to get your four barrels of gunpowder at the edges of the board to Parliament at the center of the board - you can only carry one at a time.  The board has lots of squares, some with text on them and some with tunnels for faster (but riskier) movement.<br/><br/>About a fifth of the spaces are of each player color, and the other fifth are white.  If you end your turn on a white space or your own color, your turn is over.  If you end on another color, draw a card.  These range from being good for you (&quot;Take another turn&quot;) to potentially bad for you or even for an opponent (&quot;Counterinsurgency agents raid ...&quot;).<br/><br/>Sometimes games end with Parliament being blown up, but more often one player simply has the last uncaptured piece on the board.  This is actually kind of reassuring, in a real-world sense.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thirty Three is a game of chance requiring the power of observation &amp; strategy. Using 4 dice there are 33 different number combinations to be scored. The object of the game is to score as many of these combinations as possible, in such a way as to score bonus points.<br/>The combinations are scored in 11 houses of 3, and arranged in a circle of 22 houses (2 of each) on the playing board.<br/>Each player may role one or more of their dice, up to four times during their turn. A player may stop at any time and score a combination point by playing one of their playing pieces on the appropriate place in the circle of houses.<br/>If by the end of a turn the player has not scored, the player must place one playing piece in the center of the board and deduct one point from their score at the end of the game.<br/>The game ends when there are the same number of pieces in the center as there are places left unscored in the circle of houses.<br/><br/>",

In the first phase you move your DHL van around a track on the outside of the board (via die roll).  You can get Dispatch (event) cards and Shipment cards.  When you have five of the latter you have to get your van to an airport space, and you then fly your plane along the air routes in the middle of the board, trying to get to your five destination airports.<br/><br/>You can in theory go back to the airport where you left your van and start moving that again - the reason to do this would be to try to pick up Dispatch cards that set your clock back.  Each player has a cardboard dial on which they count up to 24 hours.  Cards can tell you to add or subtract hours, and every turn you move your plane takes an hour.  If you reach 24 hours without having made all your deliveries you automatically lose.<br/><br/>",

It uses a standard deck and has four subgames (Queen of Spades, Last 2, Tricks and FanTan).<br/><br/>Queen of Spades: the object is to avoid taking the Queen of Spades.  Players who win a trick on which the QoS is played pays the bank $100.<br/><br/>Last 2:  Avoid winning the next-to-last and the last tricks.  The player who takes next-to-last trick pays $50 to bank; Player who takes the last trick pays $100 to bank.<br/><br/>Tricks: The banker gives the appropriately marked chip to the winner of each trick. At the completion of play, each player adds the numbers on his chips and multiplies this total by $10. This dollar amount is what the player receives from the bank. For example, if a player wins the 1st, 4th, and 11th tricks, then he would receive $160 from the bank (1+4+11 = 16 x $10 = $160). The 1st trick is worth $10; $20 for 2nd; $30 for 3rd; etc.<br/><br/>FanTan: Play all of one's cards before any other player can play all of his.  The bank pays $100 to the player which is the 1st Out; Bank pays $50 to 2nd Out; 3rd Out receives nothing and pays nothing; 4th Out pays $50 to bank; 5th Out pays $75 to bank; 6th Out pays $100 to bank; 7th Out pays $125 to bank; 8th Out pays $150 to bank.<br/><br/>",

This module will use the maps from both Landships! and Infernal Machines, but adds an additional 200+ counters (covering the BF109, Ju87, HEIII, T26B, BT5, BA 10, CV35, T34A, Pz I, PzIl, and PzIll to name but a few new weapons), a map section of its own, and new rules to cover the new technology. The game system uses a new, more intricate system to simulate modern aircraft and armor.<br/><br/>The scenarios, like in the previous games, are the heart of the matter. Like its predecessor, they are based on historical battles. Here, for the first time, the Spanish Civil War receives a long-overdue focus, with numerous scenarios involving tanks and the dreaded 88L56 multipurpose gun. Also covered are: The Finnish War; Zhukov in the Far East; the first encounters of the Germans with the KV-1 and T34A in 1941; the French in 1940 Indochina,; the Campaign for France in 1940; and Panzers in Norway.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>        1 double sided 11 x 17 geomorphic map<br/>        1 color countersheet containing 280 counters<br/>        historical commentary<br/>        scenarios and expansion rules<br/><br/><br/>(from COA website)<br/><br/>",

The common theme is trying to broadcast messages on various radio stations.<br/><br/>On the game board is a stylized map of the United States, indicating the boundaries of each state. The map is in four colors, and each color indicates a time zone: <br/><br/>     red: Pacific Time <br/>     green: Mountain Time <br/>     grey: Central Time <br/>     yellow: Eastern Time <br/><br/><br/>Circles across the map are joined by red and blue lines, to indicate the two dominant national radio networks, NBC Red and NBC Blue. These lines are the tracks for movement of the players' circular cardboard counters.<br/><br/>A spinner is used by the players to determine their movement around the board. A metal arrow in the center of the card is spun by a player to determine their move. The outer circle on the card is divided into the four US time zones. Within each zone are the numbers 1, 2, and 3, indicating the number of spaces to move.<br/><br/>Several versions of this game have been manufactured, including by Milton Bradley.<br/><br/>",

Each of these pieces are placed on a table, pointed side down, and with a &quot;see-saw&quot; movement can propel an &quot;Oop&quot;.<br/><br/>The idea of the game is to place the head of an OOP over the groove in the FLIPPER then strike the FLIPPER downward, thereby sending the OOP into the air and (you hope) into the CAN.<br/><br/>Game consists of:<br/><br/>        3 OOPS in each of four colors, Green, Yellow, Blue and Red OOPS<br/>        1 Black OOP (Foozy)<br/>        4 Colored Flippers (colored as OOPS)<br/>        CAN. <br/>        Instruction Sheet<br/><br/><br/>Each OOP, according to color, represents a different value.

        "description": "8 different games, using a board which represents Greater Manchester (England), in as much as each of the spaces is named after a Greater Manchester place name and the positions are approximately related to geography.  Wigan borough place names have been excluded presumably because it upsets the symmetry of the board.<br/>As well as the board, the games use counters, different colour skittle pieces.  Some of the games use a die and/or cards.<br/>The rules to each game are brief (one A5 sheet or less) and simple.  They have varying degrees of tactical scope.  Some are race games but most are abstract strategies.  The main appeal is the use of local names, assuming that the player is 'local'.<br/><br/>Some of the games use a random element in the piece set up (by drawing place name cards), some of the games use a random element in the movement allowance.  Only one game, Werneth, has no random element.<br/><br/>The limits in the number of players for each game seems to be more a function of the pieces issued rather than game balance.  There would seem to be scope for adding players if extra pieces were drafted in from another game.<br/><br/>ANCOATS (2-6 players) is a movement game.  Ability to move depends on the colour of the card drawn, the colour of the space the piece is on and the colour it is moving to.  The winner is the first player to land on the three places determined by a random selection of three cards at the start of the game.<br/><br/>BURNAGE (2-6 players) a movement game collecting cards at each space visited, or challenging other players for the cards they have collected.  The winner being the first to collect a predetermined number of cards.<br/><br/>In OFFERTON (2 players) the start location of pieces is randomised by cards.  After that, distance of movement is determined by the points on each space.  The winner is the fist player to get their six counters in a contiguous line.<br/><br/>PRESTOLEE (2-5 players) is a die movement game.  The winner is the first player to move to all 16 spaces of the player's colour, collecting a card at each location space.<br/><br/>RUSHOLME (2-6 players) has randomized set up, but movement is then dictated by the points and colours of each space.  The winner is the first to collect a specified number of counters distributed around the board.<br/><br/>SEEDLEY (2-4 players) is a card game which uses the board for reference.  A player can only pick up a place name card off the discard pile, if they are discarding an adjacent place name.<br/><br/>WERNETH (2 players) Players take it in turns to place a counter on the board, until there are 12 in total.  They then place their coloured skittle on the board.  They then take it in turns to move the their skittle according to the points on the space, restrictions on combinations of the colour of the current space, the space it is moving to, the colour of the skittle, or the presence of a counter or opponent's skittle.  The loser is the first player who cannot make a legal move on their turn.<br/><br/>",

A player takes one action on a turn; an action can be moving a piece, attacking with a piece, or loading or unloading fighters (which can be carried by motherships).<br/><br/>The different pieces move and attack differently. Fighters move two spaces a turn and can only attack adjacent pieces. Motherships can move one space or jump into hyperspace from the outer orbit (allowing them to re-enter any space in the outer orbit on a later turn), and they have beam weapons which can attack pieces two or three spaces away. Beam tanks and killer satellites also have beam weapons; beam tanks can only move around the inner orbit and satellites can only jump into hyperspace.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to remove all opposing pieces from the inner orbit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "While Minitar has an ostensible political theme (the 1968 US presidential election), in fact it is a completely abstract game.<br/><br/>Each player has a deck of cards depicting the 50 states and Washington DC, plus a wild card.  On a turn a player draws a card and places it on the 8x8 board.  If it is the first card played in one of the rows in the player's half of the board, it can go anywhere in that row, otherwise it must be adjacent to one of his or her already-placed cards.  In addition, a card can be played on top of the opponent's card showing the same state (and the wild card can be played on top of any card).<br/><br/>The object is to connect the two ends of the board with a chain of cards in your color.  Whoever manages this gets points equal to the number of electoral votes for the states in the chain.  A match is won by the first player to reach 538 points.  It is also possible to win a game by making it impossible for the other player to move.<br/><br/>As the rules are quite simple, most of the 28-page rulebook is taken up by background information - on the US as it was in the 1960 census, politicians holding office in the states and the federal government, the 1956, 1960, and 1964 elections, etc.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Object of game is to catch all of the fish on a players card. First player to fill his card with matching fish cards wins the game.<br/><br/>Each player is given a PLAYER CARD (the large cards identifying 12 fish). These cards are numbered 1 to 12. FISH CARDS (the small cards picturing up to 144 individual fish) are selected with numbers matching the players cards to be used in the game. Fish cards are shuffled and placed face down into the &quot;POND&quot; (the pond is the center of the playing table, or a box or bowl), so that players cannot see them. The game is started when the player to the left of the dealer declares &quot;I am fishing for a ________&quot; (he names one of the fish on his players card). The other players say &quot;FISH FOR IT&quot;. The player then draws a fish card from the pond. If he is lucky and &quot;catches&quot; a fish he asked for, he gets another turn. If he &quot;catches a fish shown on his player's card, but did not ask for it, he may keep it but does not get another turn. Gameplay continues until one player catches all of the fish on their player card.<br/><br/>There is an alternate game given. A poem, facts about fish, facts about fishing.<br/><br/>",

Players of Boxscorepad Baseball are called &quot;owners&quot; to distinguish them from baseball players.<br/><br/>The two owners will watch a baseball game, either on television or in person, or listen to it on the radio.  (You can also check box scores in a newspaper, having chosen players in advance.)  They take turns choosing players from the starting lineups - it doesn't matter which teams their choices are on.  You can have two players from one team and one from the other, for example.  In addition, each owner chooses one player that the other player must take!  No one may take a pitcher.<br/><br/>Points are awarded for various hits, stolen bases, RBIs, and runs scored.  Points are subtracted for errors made.  A tie-breaker is provided, as are rules for three- and four-game series.<br/><br/>",

There are ten pirates on red cardstock and ten on green cardstock.  You'll also need two d12s.<br/><br/>It's a simple game of two teams of pirates on a Caribbean island trying to get to the &quot;X marks the spot&quot; treasure before the other.  Combat is both ranged (muskets and flintlock pistols) and melee (cutlasses).  Before the game you have to assign powers to your ten pirates.  You have 100 points, which must cover two categories: speed and combat ability for all ten pirates.  Minimum number of points in a given category is 1, maximum is 10 - otherwise, you're free to spend them as you wish.  You can make a few mega pirates with high speed and combat and hope your shlumpfs can dig up the treasure while their superior comrades hold off the enemy.  Or you can make them all equal - your choice.<br/><br/>There are a couple of charts for combat, including a ranged combat table and a penalty to your defense table, based on how far you moved that turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Privilege is a trick-taking game featuring a 5-suited deck with 2 unsuited trumps.  Players play in fixed partnerships and bid for how many over-tricks they believe they will take.  The partnership making the high bid may be challenged by the others, who can potentially double or treble their score, but can re-challenge (&quot;fight to the finish&quot;) for quadruple points (all of these have large negative consequences if one loses).<br/><br/>The trick play is more or less standard, with two exceptions.  One is the pair of unsuited trumps, which rank below the top four cards of the trump suit.  The other is that the five suits are grouped into a pair and a triplet, and the suits in each set can be played for each other at times (the rules are a bit confusing here).<br/><br/>Scoring is reminiscent of bridge, with points earned above and below the line.<br/><br/>While the main game is for exactly four players, a solitaire game is included.<br/><br/>Probably the main point of interest is the game's 1930s Socialist flavor.  The good suits are Scientists, Idealists, and Judges, with the bad ones Bankers and Advertisers.  The cards are individually named, some for people and some for methods and tools (&quot;Radio,&quot; &quot;Logic,&quot; etc.).  The unsuited trumps are Honesty and Kindness.<br/><br/>Also of interest are the card illustrations.  Some were done by the designer, but the others by well-known American artists of the period - Rockwell Kent, Peggy Bacon, William Gropper, and George Schreiber (other cards were by Esther Vance, who appears to not have attracted much attention in the art world). The game was self-published by the designer, Robert Morey. The game was manufactured as a custom job for him by Alderman-Fairchild of Rochester, NY.<br/><br/>",

Pico - A gin rummy type game for two players.<br/>2. Crazy Azy - A Crazy Eight&rsquo;s type game for 2-6 players.<br/>3. Mates - A Concentration type game for younger players.<br/>An example of how the cards work is as follows: Card 69 has Italy in the Country quarter, card 26 has Rome in the Capital quarter, card 25 has Italian in the Language quarter and card 56 has Lira in the Monetary unit quarter.

        "description": "This game is themed on The Country Club Plaza, or simply &quot;The Plaza&quot;, an upscale shopping district in Kansas City, Missouri. I'm not certain where to begin describing this one, so let me give an overview and a look at the components.<br/><br/>The game board is styled after the traditional Monopoly board as a square with properties down each of the sides and special areas on the corners--in this case the corners are *J.C. Nichols Parkway* Start &gt;, Tax Audit &laquo;Pay&raquo;, &deg;Stock Market: Collect&deg;, and *Uninsurable Loss*.  Unlike the traditional Monopoly board, there are no squares that are not properties (e.g. no Chance, Community Chest) Additionally, the properties are not grouped in colors.  All of the properties are representative of Plaza businesses at the time of printing.<br/><br/>The six player pieces are small, colored, enameled, metal, horse-drawn carriages, like the type that they use for carriage rides down on The Plaza.  Additionally, there is money in denominations of $1,000, $5,000, $10,000, $20,000, $50,000, and $100,000.  There is a spinner with the numbers 1,000 to 12,000.  There is also a deck of action cards with various things like &quot;Option to buy  - spin dial, pay  amount on dial&quot;, &quot;Stock Market Falls - Pay $10,000 to bank, don't move, resume play&quot;, and the enigmatic &quot;Two Spaces&quot;.<br/><br/>...and that's it; no instructions, no dice, no property deeds or property values.  I'm stumped as to whether this was actually a game, or if this was a game prototype that never made it to fruition.  The cardboard insert inside the box has no markings on it, there is nothing on the inside of the lid, and the box itself is completely blank and made to look like a nice leather briefcase (albeit made of cardboard) and has no information on it, not even the game's name--the name only appears on the board. If anyone knows anything about this game, please add information because I'm at a loss.<br/><br/>UPDATE 09-07-2015: Instructions under &quot;More Information.&quot; -- ActorDi<br/><br/>",

However, there is no explicit tie-in to any particular show.<br/><br/>",

This player does not control a car, but does collect all fines imposed.<br/><br/>In essence, the Town &amp; Country Traffic game could be viewed as an overproduced spin-and-move game. Metal cars and the metal plunger-driven wheel provide visual appeal, though the wheel could easily have been replaced with a simpler, cheaper, and more reliable spinner.<br/><br/>At least two component variations exist.

Each planet begins with no defense.<br/><br/>Player collect up to 5 cards each turn and use these to either attack or defend planets in any 5 dimensions. Each attack will cost the player stimuli which can be gained each turn depending on the number of cards that is taken that turn.<br/><br/>By basically taking control of enemy planets, player can force enemy players onto a planet where they can no longer escape from. When this happens, the enemy player will become enslaved and must now work together with the attacking player. This is a great feature which prevents players who would normally have lost from being bored while waiting for the game to end.<br/><br/>The game features a 5 piece circular board so that the position of the 5 clans can be changed each game. Each player also has a cool stand to place their circular game cards in, and there's a handy little device from which players can slide out new game cards.<br/><br/>Van der Veer Games has a playable flash demo on their website and have also just launched an online multi-player version based on the boardgame.

As cards were inserted into the main unit, batting/pitching stats for the corresponding player would then be read and used in game play. For those who did not wish to sully their baseball cards with the adhesive stickers, a standard lineup was provided within the hand held unit.<br/><br/>Stickers for player performance in the 1988 season were provided within the base game.

It is unlikely that the use of these names was authorized; however, the scenario book seems sufficiently obscure that it is also unlikely George Lucas ever noticed it.<br/><br/>The booklet contains a list of forces, a map, a seven page scenario description, and a five page set of rule modifications to &quot;Small Game Tables&quot;. It is apparent that the scenario was designed to be used in concert with an existing rules system. However, aside from references to &quot;'Brew up' rules - page 25 and 26&quot;, no clue is given as to which rules system this scenario was intended to be run under.<br/><br/>",

Let's Get Ready (no winner)<br/>This is a practice game where Mother Goose asks you to put cards into her book. (When you insert the card her head moves and her beak opens by the pressure of putting in the card. It is not mechanical movement)<br/><br/>2. The Collect Game (has a winner)<br/>Mother Goose will call out a color. If you natch the color you press it and she tells you how many spaces to move on the game board. There is even a put the game piece on any space and take another turn option.<br/><br/>After you move, you then take the card closest to the pawn piece and insert it in the Mother Goose's Book. Once she is done singing you collect that color card and put it in front of you.<br/><br/>Everyone is using the same pawn piece because the goal is to be the first player to collect all 4 colors of the song cards. Then you are the winner<br/><br/>3. The Pairs Game (has a winner)<br/>Plays the same as the above game except the first person to collect three matching cards.<br/><br/>Since you are pressing the colored button, Mother Goose will know who the winner is based on the cards in the piles she has left and who picked which card.<br/><br/>The four songs<br/><br/>Jack and Jill<br/>Humpty Dumpty<br/>Hickory Dickory Dock<br/>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star<br/><br/>",

In the most simplistic, players simply collect Tooth Truth cards and ignore the trivia questions on them. In the standard game, players must answer the Tooth Truth question appropriate to their age and dental experience in order to win the card. Finally, when all players are of the same age group/experience, the players can choose the difficulty level of the question they wish to answer and receive points according to that difficulty level.<br/><br/>Also worthy of note are the metal movers used in the game. These are characters cast as lead figures, shaped like different types of teeth, and given names such as &quot;Sir Incisor&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Eloping, each player has three prospective grooms, a prospective bride, a prospective mother-in-law, a plane and a train piece. Players attempt to move a groom to another player's home space to gain a bride and form a couple. The couple must then visit the Town Hall to obtain a marriage license, than obtain a corsage and a ring before proceeding to the Justice of the Peace (JP) space. Two other people (prospective grooms or the mother-in-law piece) must also join the couple at the JP to act as witnesses. The first player to bring the required four player pieces as well as the corsage, and ring to the JP is the winner.<br/><br/>A plane and a train are available to each player. These pieces move a greater distance than a player piece may normally travel, but are subject to other restrictions (e.g., only moves on a roll of 5, must move to another unoccupied airport/train station space, etc.).<br/><br/>An optional rule lets a player use the mother-in-law piece to block a couple containing that player's bride piece. The couple may only move past the mother-in-law on a restricted set of die rolls.<br/><br/>There are at least two printings of this game. The more deluxe printing uses a mock-velvet box lining and elastic bands to hold the player pieces, plus contains a setup sheet (printed with an interesting 3-D effect) that described various moves in the game.<br/><br/>",

A game for any number of players, as individuals, partners, or teams.<br/><br/>There are no right or wrong answers here!  You simply have to match your answer to that of your partner.  From a three-letter word fragment, you select a word or words that the letters might stand for or would logically contain those letters.  I know that sounds complicated, but it really is not. (i.e. USA - United States of America; LTR could be letter, later, litter, etc.)  Some are easy, others more difficult.  You may choose what level you play on and receive your score accordingly, or roll the dice and take your chances.<br/><br/>Why LOCUTION? As your teacher would say, &quot;look it up&quot;.  OK, so it's not an exact description of the game, but it's the best I could do on my first attempt at something like this.  I had an idea that I thought some people might enjoy, and friends agreed -- so here it is!  Not having the resources of a big game company, I am doing the best I can.<br/><br/>I believe this is a great game for groups -- even large groups -- with participation by all players.  The first time you play it, you'll get your money's worth; after that, it's free!!!<br/><br/>Oh, sorry gals, the guys have the advantage here, so guys against gals is not recommended.  It seems that men's limited vocabulary gives the guys an edge!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is similar to the kids game Jumbolino. Players roll a die and add pieces to their plastic scarecrows based on the number rolled. The first player to assemble a complete scarecrow wins. Game comes with 4 plastic Scarecrows and 1 die. This is a very simple game. On your turn you roll the die. If you roll a 1 you put a head on the scarecrow. Then if you roll a 2 you put the body, 3 the right arm, 4 the left arm, 5 the right leg and 6 the left leg. These pieces must be put on in exact order so if you are up to needing a 4 and you don't roll it your opponent gets a turn. etc. until someone puts the scarecrow together.<br/><br/>This game is similar to Dunce, except that in that game players lose when they finish their figure.  That game also features a teetotum instead of a die, and one of the faces allows a player to skip a turn while compelling other players to add a part.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thinking Man's Basketball was intended to join the 3M Sports Games line of vinyl wraparound games. It never made it past the prototype stage.<br/><br/>Each side drafts a team simply by writing seven numbers on a sheet of paper and assigns them positions (1 Center, 3 Forwards and 3 Guards), then choosing 5 of these to start the game. Players position and move their team members up and down the board for the best chance to make a shot (or cover a rebound), then roll on charts when a shot is taken to determine the result. Movement (both distance and the ability to change directions) is determined by the position played by each team member. Players can also challenge possession as the ball is dribbled or passed.<br/><br/>Each quarter progresses until both teams combined have scored at least 15 points, though experienced players can boost this to 25-30 per period. After 4 quarters, the player with the most points wins. In the event of a tie, 7 point overtime periods are played until a winner emerges.<br/><br/>It is uncertain how many prototypes 3M produced. Reputedly the prototype(s) were of production quality, save that the inner black box was not specifically tailored to the game.<br/><br/>At least one prototype was sent to Sid Sackson for evaluation, with a note from 3M asking for his opinions and stating that he could keep the game. Sid later apparently sold this prototype, but made photocopies of the rules and key game elements in 1993 and retained these for reference.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In essence, Competition is a four-handed game of Checkers. However, there are several unusual twists to the game that keep it from fitting neatly into one category.<br/><br/><br/>    First, each player starts with a limited supply of play money. There are costs associated with various moves, so it is possible to lose by running out of money.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Second, each player only starts with five of their eight pieces on the board, and must pay to bring the other three onto the board when space in the back row becomes available for them.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Third, the games spaces have costs or rewards associated with them. Most of the spaces will cost money.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Fourth, there is a safe &quot;corridor&quot; between the four board quarters. A player may not be captured when in that safe area, but may capture a piece when coming onto another board.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when only one player has any money left, when only one player has any pieces left, or when one player has successfully confined their last opponent within their own home board.<br/><br/>",

The starting player then deals out &quot;Catch Them&quot; cards equal to the number of villains a player faces.<br/><br/>The starting player then takes the card from the top of the &quot;Catch Them&quot; deck and either keeps it (if it is one of the villains she needs) or passes it to the player on her left. If she keeps it, she must pass another card from her hand. The player on the left must now either keep or pass. In the mean time, the starting player is looking at the next card from the deck and deciding to keep or pass. This continues around the table, with all players keeping and passing cards until one player collects all the villains indicated on her &quot;Villain&quot; card.<br/><br/>The first player to collect all the villains she needs grabs the Bubbles bobblehead from the center of the board. The other players now try to grab one of the other Powerpuff Girls from the center. Since there is one less Powerpuff Girl than there are players, one player won't get anything (ala musical chairs).<br/><br/>The player who ended up with nothing does not move. Players who grabbed a Powerpuff Girl move one space along the board. The player who grabbed Bubbles spins the spinner and moves either 3, 4 or 5 spaces. Rounds are repeated until a player reaches the Finish space and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

It has a flexible combo system that will allow you to create custom combos but also has move attributes, combo types and combo costs that will limit their strength. There are quite a few options you may do on your turn.<br/><br/>You may discard a number card to basic attack, throws some face cards down or use some aces to punish your opponent with Super Moves. There is also a tag-team mode (two characters on a team) which allows you to use jokers for tag-team moves.<br/><br/>This game requires a decent amount of strategy considering you may be countered or dodged.. There are over 20+ characters as of right now, each with their own unique abilities, play styles, strengths &amp; weaknesses with more to come as the expansions progress. For a more detailed explanation on how to play this game please review the Rule Book.<br/><br/>",

Each suit has cards numbered 1-6, four copies of each.  There are also four Inspection cards, one for each player, and a Warmonger card.  The Swords and Warmonger are distributed at the start of each hand - whoever gets the Warmonger card plays differently from everyone else.  Peaceful players disarm (discard face-down) Swords cards and build sets of Plowshares, Manpower, and Cogwheels, while the Warmonger secretly &quot;disarms&quot; Plowshares and other non-Swords cards and builds using Swords instead of Plowshares.<br/><br/>Points are awarded for building sets and for successfully deducing who the Warmonger is (the Warmonger gets points if no one figures this out).<br/><br/>",

There are yellow STATEMENT cards, with words like input, let, rem, print and orange COMMAND cards with words like end, new, and load. Then there is a 3rd set of cards, the line cards, with rem, end, let, input, etc. across the top and programs, or partial programs written on them.<br/><br/>The instructions include the standard game and supplemental activities. In the instructions it states: &quot;The Following Is Not For The Faint Of Heart, Anyone easily frighted by technical jargon should turn back now!&quot; just before the Supplemental Activities section.

The first player draws a card showing a series of jumps along the mat spaces ending at the Forest (like, double-footed hop, left-foot hop, then 2 more double-footed hops, Forest). The player then jumps the sequence. If he stumbles or uses the wrong foot, he returns the card to the deck and his turn ends. If he succeeds, the other players must duplicate the jump sequence he just performed. The first player to correctly duplicate the sequence wins the card. The player with the most cards at the end wins.<br/><br/>",

The object is to be the first player to help Princess Jasmine gather up her friends and meet Aladdin at the Wedding Pavilion for their marriage. On a turn, a player moves Jasmine (on the flying carpet) to any space on the lower board. Spaces all contain Magic Coins which the player turns over and examines through the Magic Ring revealing the hidden picture of a character. If it is a friend - Abu, Genie, Iago or Rajah - and you have not collected it, keep it and go again. If it is a Jafar coin or a friend the player already has, it is put back and the player's turn ends.<br/><br/>When you have collected all 4 friends move Jasmine to the alter and examine 1 of the 5 Wedding Coins. If it is Jafar you must try again next turn. If Aladdin is revealed the player wins and places Jasmine and Aladdin in the Wedding Pavilion.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an old Parker Brothers game that simulates a day at the links. The game board depicts an entire 18 hole golf coarse with tees, greens, fairways, and hazards. The fairways have lines marked on them to indicate yardage. Each player has a ball pin to indicate their locations on a hole. A deck of cards is used to indicate the results of a swing.<br/><br/>On a turn a player calls out the club he is using, choosing from a (very 1920s) selection of: Driver, Brassie, Midiron, Mashie, Mashie-Niblick, Niblick, Putter. The player then turns over the top card, consults the club he called, and moves his pin down the fairway the amount of yards indicated. Some cards indicate a poor swing by declaring the ball out of bounds or in the rough. A ball landing in a hazard has a limited club selection for its next shot. For example, a ball in the rough can only be played with a Mashie, a Mashie-Niblick, or a Niblick. When a player's yardage generated equals the yardage of the hole, he has holed out.<br/><br/>Since this is an old game that was published before stroke play became the standard, the winner is the player who won the most holes (match play).<br/><br/>",

The game board depicts a map of the United States with all the State Capitals listed, and a track of Stars (spaces), each listing a State's name and the year it was admitted to the Union. An American flag is placed on every eighth Star (there were only 48 states at the time), while Red Tokens are placed on the remaining Stars.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player spins the spinner and moves his playing piece the number of Stars indicated. He then reads aloud the name of the State he landed on, the year it was admitted to the Union, and (without looking at the map) the State's Capital. If he names the Capital correctly he may keep the Flag or Token. If the player is incorrect he moves backwards to the first vacant space. If he spins a &quot;1776&quot; or a &quot;Statue of Liberty&quot; he moves forward to the next space with a flag or token and, if he correctly names the Capital, may spin again. The game ends when a player reaches the last space. All players add up their scores - Flags are worth 10 points, tokens are worth 1 point - and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

For a turn, a player spins the spinner and, if it points to one of his marbles, removes the marble from the circular track and places it in one of the holes in the corner of his color. If it points to another player's marble, the other player removes the marble and places it in his corner. If it points to either of the two gray penalty spaces, the player who spun must put back on the track a marble that he has captured. The first player to gather all four of his marbles into his corner wins the game.<br/><br/>The game also comes with alternate rules in which a player calls out a color and then spins. If the spinner points to a marbles who's color matches the color called the player places it in his corner. In this version the first player to fill his corner with one red, one blue, one green and one yellow marble wins.<br/><br/>Mostly luck, the game combines a spinner (arrow) with the mechanics of roulette = Arrowlette.<br/><br/>",

The board has three training sections - Primary, Basic and Advanced, respectively indicated by Red, White and Blue coloring. The spaces of each section contain a number and a picture of various tasks and skills that a recruit needs to master.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, players spin the spinner and place one of their markers on the Primary Training space as spun on the Red Circle. If the player has already covered the space, he may take 1 extra spin per turn. When a player has &quot;covered&quot; all the Primary spaces he enters the Basic Training section and uses the White circle on the spinner. When he finishes Basic Training he moves to the Advanced Training spaces and uses the Blue Circle.<br/><br/>If a player covers 3 spaces in a row he may play an additional marker on any space still open to him in that section. Markers left in the Primary Section may also be used by adding the number on the marker's space to the number spun on the spinner. If the sum of these 2 numbers equals the number of an empty space in the section the player is working on he may move the Primary marker to cover the &quot;open&quot; space. The first player to cover all the spaces in the Advanced Training section is the first to graduate, and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Cardboard dividers of the same color as the player paddles separate the playing areas. Six plastic fish of each color and a boot are placed on the pond surface.<br/><br/>When everyone is ready, players begin hitting their paddles making the fish wiggle and flop in the air, trying to get their color fish to land in their area. When all fish are off the board, players return fish that are not their own color. The player with the boot returns the boot and also one of his own color fish as a penalty. Play then continues and the first player to collect all his fish wins.<br/><br/>",

Then each player is dealt one card from the deck. Both cards are player face up in front of the player.<br/><br/>On a turn, you draw a card from the deck. If it is a Barney the Dinosaur card, you compare his pose to the cards you have played and if it matches one you place the two cards together to form a pair. If it doesn't match you play it face up in front of you hoping to pair it up later. If you draw a Baby Bop card it automatically forms a pair with your &quot;You&quot; card. If you draw a Give or Take card you either give or take a card from another player. When the draw pile is gone, the player with the most pairs wins.<br/><br/>The cards can also be used to play a standard memory game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crusade - This is the next generation of board games.<br/><br/>What is it?<br/>Crusade is an exciting 2-player board game that is also a three-dimensional card game. If you or anyone you know likes playing card games or thought provoking board games then this is an absolute must-have. Designed with adults in mind it makes a great present for a wide range of ages and will keep both players intrigued every time they play. A typical game lasts about 15~20 minutes so you'll never get bored, you'll never play the same game twice and it really is never over until the last turn of the card. It has very few rules, but for those who prefer not to read rules at all or to have to explain them to new players, each game comes complete with a short 10 minute/side audio-cassette. Side one gives full instructions and an explanation of how to set up the playing pieces, how they move and why. Side two gives simple strategies enough to take you through your first exciting game. Play it once and you've learned it, but it takes memory, luck and cunning to become a really great player. The unique assembly of the playing area and rigid storage box will allow you to play on a full size board, yet when packed away the game is so compact you can take it, or store it, almost anywhere. It is ideal for use in the home, on boats and in caravans. Games are only available direct from the manufacturer and can be ordered by credit card on the secure Internet site or by Fax, Phone and Post.<br/><br/>Crusade had been in development for over 10 years before it was put into production, during that period it was extensively tested and refined, into what we believe is now the most exciting 2-player board game ever. It really is the most addictive game you will ever play, the logo 'never just a game' says it all, we've not met anyone yet who has just played one game and put it back in it's box!<br/><br/>The concept was to create a brand new game that had a timeless theme, a game that could stand the test of time in the same manner as Chess and Checkers (Draughts) this would mean the game could not be linked to any film or television characters as they could only date the game to their own popularity. The game would be designed to be user friendly and instantly familiar, as soon as the first game had been played the contestants should feel as though they have been able to play it all their lives. But in order to keep the players interest, the more times the game would be played the greater the thought would need to go into each move. There should be no complicated rules, the game should flow naturally requiring variations in strategy through a series of constant decisions presented by multiple choices and allow for changes in tactics and objectives as various options and opportunities arose.<br/>The playing arena had to be unique, it was required to be robust but light and of a sufficiently large size to make it have a real presence when in use, yet when dismantled the board needed to be compact and take up as little storage space as possible. The board would also to be designed with the facility of integrating a personalized advertising panel allowing corporate customers to promote their company along side the playing area.<br/>The playing pieces would need to be clearly distinguishable and easy to use as this game would not only be played by adults but also by the young and the elderly.<br/>The traditional problem of explaining rules and strategies to new player would be overcome by including in each game box, in addition to the standard explanation leaflet, an audio-tape of not longer than 10 minutes per side that would explain every aspect of the game and allow instant play.<br/><br/>In the beginning.<br/>We started by examining existing board games and listed their strengths and weaknesses. Probably the most universally well-known board game is Chess; it's been around for over 2000 years so it's certainly stood the test of time. However, great game though it undoubtedly is, it does have basic weaknesses; it's difficult to learn to play well, and a player needs an opponent who is on the same level in order to produce a good contest, a novice or a grand master will provide little entertainment to an average player. Another major factor is, it's enough to give you a headache trying to think all those moves ahead, we wanted a game where you could laugh and joke while you played, our game had to be fun, serious fun. We wanted certain elements of Chess but without the complexity and the seriousness. We accepted that one of the great strengths of Chess was that it allowed for changes in strategy throughout the game and although the game could get very involved, there were actually very few rules. Once you knew how the pieces moved and their relative values that was enough to get you started. Another great strength was the layout of the playing area, very simple and mathematically perfect.<br/>The next choice was to choose what would be the driving force of the game, what made the pieces move. Many traditional board games use dice to determine the moves, well that again we saw that as a weakness, luck plays a very big part in dice games, meaning there is very little skill involved in relation to chance. We decided that a standard pack of playing cards would determine which playing piece moved in Crusade they would give infinitely more permutations to their order of play than dice, as well as the fact that a pack of playing cards is familiar to everyone.<br/><br/>Armed with this basic criteria for a new game we stripped out all the other aspects linked with existing board games that we considered not acceptable so:<br/><br/>Out went the boring type of game that seems to go on for days, but you can tell who's going to win after the first half hour.<br/>Excitement is built in to Crusade, it's a quick, yet thought provoking game. Each game will last on average about 15-20 minutes and you'll need memory, luck and cunning in order to become a great player.<br/><br/>Out went the endless pages of rules; so complicated and ambiguous that you spent more time reading them than playing the game and the difficulties of explaining to new players what a game is all about is also resolved.<br/>Crusade has very few rules; it's based more on an understanding of the playing pieces objectives and how they move around the board. Play it once and you've learned it, perhaps the strangest thing is, in no time at all, you'll feel you've played it all your life. To help you learn to play in minutes and to explain the game to new players, each game comes complete with a short audio-cassette. Side 1 explains how to set out the pieces, how they move and why, and how to play the game. Side 2 provides hints on strategies and details a full demonstration game.<br/><br/>Out went the old fashioned cardboard playing area with the unsightly crease down the center, that folded away into a weird long flat box, which you couldn't seem to store anywhere.<br/>Crusade has a sturdy four piece high quality molded game-board that twists together in seconds to produce a full size playing arena, yet when dismantled it packs away into a specially designed box that gives maximum protection with compact storage. Approximate dimensions in mm. 316L x 162W x 60D (like a shoe box but about half as deep) with a weight of less than 1 kilogram. This makes Crusade not only a fantastic game to keep at home but also the ideal game for use in boats and caravans, where space is at a premium.<br/><br/>Out went the problem of finding a group of people to play with you.<br/>Crusade has been designed to be a 2-player game, because it's far easier to find one person to play with rather than getting together the 4 or 6 people required for some types of board games. Opponents can also be drawn from a vast age range. We recommend it is suitable from 8 years old to Adult, however many below 8 years old can pick up the idea of the game within minutes, as have the many people in their 80's who now enjoy playing. There's a simple handicapping system that allows an expert to have an interesting and exciting game with a complete novice, but nobody stays a novice for long. Even playing with people who do not speak your language is not a barrier; the game becomes self-explanatory by just watching it being played. You will become familiar with Crusade quite literally within minutes, you can play time and time again but you'll never play the same game twice. Each game is a new challenge and throughout the game, even if at times your position doesn't look strong, you still have a chance of winning right up to the very end. It's totally absorbing and never over until the last card is played.<br/><br/>",

If you land on a &quot;Draw a Card&quot; space, you take a Blondie Card and follow the instructions (such as &quot;Move to another track.&quot;) When you land on a letter space at the top of a track, you take a letter token that matches the letter on the space. The first player to obtain all seven letters and spell Blondie wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the back of the Rules:<br/>&quot;What is ROOSTERTAIL? Title of the game is taken from the term fans, sportswriters and broadcasters apply to the huge plume of water rising to 20 feet which the hydroplane churns in the air as it races across the water's surface at speeds up to 200 miles per hour. Rules, hazards and bonuses of the game are based on hydroplane racing which annually draws hundreds of thousands of spectators to such events as the Gold Cup: Seattle Seafair Trophy race on Lake Washington; President's Cup: Potomac River, Washington, D.C.; Silver Cup: Detroit River, Detroit Michigan; Apple Cup: Lake Chelan, Washington; Governor's Cup: Madison, Indiana; Sahara Cup: Lake Mead, Nevada, and many others.&quot;<br/><br/>The Game's components consist of the following:<br/>A plain, narrow cardboard Box bottom, with a matching WHITE Box Top with &quot;Roostertail!&quot; in RED print, &quot;The Hydroplane Racing Game...&quot; in Dark BLUE print and a colorful picture of (3)-Hydros with accompanying 'roostertails'! The 'Roostertail Rules' are around a 1/2 size sheet of paper printed on BOTH sides and folded over. Very concise indeed. There are a couple of DICE for rolling to conduct movement,  (4)-metal cast 'Hydros'(with pluming &quot;Roostertails!&quot;) in RED, BLUE, GREEN, &amp; ORANGE; a nicely mounted Gameboard 14-3/4-inches by 16-1/8-inches; a few Scoring Sheets(about 1/4 size of a paper sheet); a Deck of HAZARDS Cards; and a Deck of BONUS Cards.<br/><br/>The gameboard playing surface consists of (4)-lanes of mainly WHITE 'squares' in a rectangular fashion, with a WHITE print on BLACK &quot;Starting Line&quot;, many YELLOW &quot;Hazards&quot; squares intermingled along the 'Lanes', and &quot;Dead in the Water&quot; squares at the corners, with a portion of the gameboard reserved for the &quot;Pit&quot; area, the 'Scoring' Table, and places for the CARDS. There is also the same 'picture' in the center section as what is found on the Box Top, with the notable addition of 'corner buoys' in the corners(where else?), these come into play with some of the 'Hazards' CARDS.<br/><br/>Each 'Heat' consists of (3)-laps around the board and then scoring is adjusted for the outcomes. You can call your 'boat' anything you wish as long as you write it's name down, while the 'Hazard' CARDS depict events that could occur when engaged in such an endeavor(such as &quot;Oil Leak&quot;, &quot;Missed Buoy&quot;, &quot;Debris&quot;, etc.), and the 'BONUS' Cards usually allow for EXTRA movements that you will get when you &quot;roll DOUBLES&quot;! There is even a &quot;Flying Start&quot; before each 'Heat', to get the game going with to determine who begins in which 'Lane' during the ensuing 'Race' . Allowances for 'passing' into another LANE are permitted, but NO &quot;diagonal&quot; Movements, or 'jumping' are allowed! They have willingly 'dismissed' the notion of 'collisions', for ease of play no doubt. If you happen to get 'boxed in', then you are stuck and LOSE your Turn! Quite a nice little &quot;gem&quot; of a game for it's time(mid 1950s!), if I do say so myself! &quot;Where DOES he get those 'Wonderful Toys'!?!&quot;-the 'Joker'~Batman: the MOVIE<br/><br/>",

This game board has circular spaces arranged in a grid and the fox and rabbit pieces start in their respective corners. To move, you roll two dice. You must advance your piece in one direction the full number of spaces indicated on 1 die (your choice), then make a right turn and advance the full number of spaces indicated on the other die.<br/><br/>The rabbit player wins if the rabbit piece lands by exact count on the space marked &quot;White Rabbit's Home&quot;. The object for the fox player is to land by exact count on the rabbit. After the fox lands on the rabbit, the rabbit may attempt to escape by rolling the dice, and if the move shown by this roll would land the rabbit in the 5 center spaces marked &quot;Briar Patch&quot;, the rabbit escapes to the space rolled (landing on the rabbit's house would also escape and win the game). If the rabbit cannot escape the fox wins the game. To compensate for this escape advantage, the fox player gets an additional move on a roll of doubles.<br/><br/>A 4-player version may also be played with 2 fox and 2 rabbits.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player rolls a die and places a chip on his card over the number rolled. If more than 1 number rolled is uncovered on his card, the player chooses which one to place a chip on. The first player to place 4 chips in row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally, calls out &quot;KENO&quot; and wins the game.<br/><br/>In the second game, players roll 2 dice and cover both the numbers rolled. When a player covers all the spots on his card, the player calls out &quot;KENO&quot; and play stops. The Keno caller scores 60 points (the sum of all the numbers on his card). The other players add up all the numbers they have covered, and if the number ends with 0 or 5 (45, 50, 55 etc.), the points are taken by the player who called KENO. If the number does not end with 0 or 5, the points are credited to the player who holds that particular card.

        "description": "A professionally produced game put out by Voarisoa Observatoire Environnemental, the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, and other environmental and government agencies.  It is apparently intended to educate players on environmental issues and the regime of international law governing waste and toxic chemicals.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a pawn and eight chits.  Play is standard roll and move.  Players move along a Candyland-like track via roll of a die.  In addition to moving, when a player rolls an odd number, that player picks up a red card, and when a player rolls an even number, that player picks up a green card.  Red cards are negative (such as environmental poisoning or violation of the law) and require you to lose chits or move backwards.  Green cards are positive (such as donating money or following regulations) and allow you to take chits or move forwards.  The winner is the player who makes it to the final space -- so long as that player has not lost all chits.<br/><br/>This is a straightforward luck-of-the-die game, but is notable for its educational bent and its unusual artwork.  The cover, for example, displays a man with a gas mask sucking a lollipop, as well as a baby drinking petroleum.  It is also likely the only game which includes, as part of its rule sheet, the &quot;Ten Gold Rules for the Storage of Dangerous Chemicals.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a Booklet with around 86 pages(some are for taking notes), that details *NEW* Weaponry for use by itself, or with *Battle-Tech*(TM-FASA), and associated games along that line. A 'disclaimer' is denoted, wherein the publishers attempted to gain permission from FASA to associate the Booklet with *B-T*, but they(FASA) declined to 'Team up' with them on this. Apparently, they(the publisher of this, et al) wished to gain some 'authenticity' from FASA, to allow others to be able to use these 'Rules' in any 'Official' capacity. They've even included a copy of the 'letter' from FASA, with their 'polite' response of &quot;no thanks&quot; from the then President-Sam Lewis!<br/><br/>Within this Booklet(which measures 5-1/2 inches by 8-1/2 inches), you will find it ALL to be in BLACK &amp; WHITE print(including numerous Artist's drawings) with a BLUE plastic 'binding' for the pages. They have created their very own 'unique' terms for most of these *NEW* concepts, that were arrived at through numerous playings within the *B-T* gaming circles. Some of the items discussed relate to current Vehicles and Weaponry(circa 1992), while others are quite fanciful in their conceptualizations. There are even a few that look to be 'lifted' from some other 'genres', and they've made an attempt to find a 'niche' for them within this. They have even provided &quot;Unit Organizational Displays&quot; that allow for several individual 'Units' to comprise a much larger one. For some of the 'Weaponry', you'll need to provide a 'Status Sheet' of your own making, but they do provide a general 'diagram' of how to go about accomplishing this. One other item of note- there are numerous 'narratives' that are used to give some sort of more descriptive idea of what is being portrayed. And lastly, there is a means of using another 'product' from this publisher(namely &quot;Assault on Kuwait City&quot;) with these 'Rules', which is mostly just using the game's counters &amp; mapsheet from that.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ostensibly a Monopoly-style roll-and-move game, this apparently sparsely-produced game centered around Flagstaff, AZ, has players gaining property in a more abstract method.  The board is laid out in the traditional square with properties lined up on each side and neutral spaces in the corners.  Properties are colored in one of four colors which correspond to the &quot;se-va&quot; or money notes.  Instead of purchasing properties landed upon, players instead arbitrarily pick up a note of that property's color when they land there, until one player has ten notes of that color and becomes &quot;owner&quot; of that color so long as they have more than ten notes of that color; when players subsequently land on that color they must pay the player that controls that color three notes of that color.  If unable to pay three notes of that color, they must pay the banker or &quot;Escrow Agent&quot; five notes of any color.  If a player does not have enough notes to pay the Escrow Agent, they are eliminated from the game.  Though not spelled out entirely, the winner of the game is apparently the last player remaining.  Additionally there are spaces on the board that correspond to the &quot;Rattlesnake Pit&quot; and &quot;Kachina&quot; decks, with the former as detrimental &quot;se-va&quot; losing cards and the latter as beneficial &quot;se-va&quot; gaining cards.<br/><br/>As an editorial aside, some people refer to games as &quot;Multi-Player Solitaire&quot;; this game truly qualifies as such.  The _only_ decisions that players can make that affect the outcome of the game are what colors of &quot;se-va&quot; notes to pay the Escrow Agent when they do not have enough of a single color to pay a property owner, and what color or colors to pay when they draw a &quot;Rattlesnake Pit&quot; card.  Every other decision is governed by the state of the game and cannot be impacted by the players.<br/><br/>",

This can be done two ways, either by throwing your own number or by being the last person standing in a game. The game works by using six characters, each having their own particular winning number and stake. A player chooses which character they wish to play with (depending on how much money they have and their ability to throw that number) and then place their stake on the board, then the game commences with the Gangster&hellip; and then clockwise to the Lawyer.<br/><br/>Players follow the dice instructions according to the number thrown.

And the right hand (circular) board where the players move and take control of the dictators. The aim of Dictatoropoly is to control the majority of the dictators using your counters. The money builds up on the left hand board until someone takes control of that dictator and wins the stash, cash is then paid straight to the player until they lose control. A bit like a tug of war the dictators can pass back and forth several times before someone takes the majority. In the meantime the more you control the more you make! The less you control the more you Pay! Avoiding the pitfalls of the riot police, UN court and assassination attempts players take control of the ten different dictator squares by winning possession or taking them by force through dice rolling. Players have to pay for the weapons of mass destruction they use as they move around the board, unless they own them then the money is theirs. By holding the more high profile dictators in their control, players will begin to make a tidy sum from the other players. This can be played using any unit price (1p, 5p, 10p &pound;1 etc) Create your own Dictatoropoly and rule the world with no care for the consequences. Control the majority of the board and you win!

The new release of Flusskoenig &quot;Director's Cut&quot; expands the game with several new components that were originally planned for the first game but ended up being cut so that the game duration didn't run too long.<br/><br/>Still, as is usual with NMG games, Flusskoenig &quot;Director's Cut&quot; will run at least 3 hours (for comparison, Flusskoenig clocked in at 90-120 minutes). Once again, the idea of the game is to transport wares via ship. The players lay out a river network at the start of the game, one that can twist and turn as desired and provide either 'realistic surroundings' or a 'fantasy world'. Players then get money and can buy expensive ships, ship enhancements and branch offices - the things that bring the points necessary for victory. Locks, toll booths, fog and low water make sure that the riverboat captains have to work hard.<br/><br/>The &quot;Director's Cut&quot; version expands the game with new river tiles with additional hazards, new ship types and wares, a deck of &quot;truly evil&quot; action and event cards, and other accessories.<br/><br/>",

The game unit is a motorized turntable with 3 plastic dolphins that rise up and down (i.e. disco dance) while opening and closing their mouths. Four Shooters (catapults) are positioned around the board. Players place 7 marbles in their shooter track, which feeds into their Shooter, before starting. The unit is then turned on by pulling up on the center buoy causing the turntable to spin while the dolphins dance and open their mouths. Players simultaneously try to shoot their marbles into the open mouths. If successful, the marble drains into a side tray by the player's Shooter.

        "description": "&quot;KAJI is based on a Japanese game (JAN-KEN-PO) centuries old, in which the hands are used as symbols.&quot; A.k.a. Rock-Paper-Scissors. There are four suits of 12 cards each, numbered 1 -12. The suits are JAN (stone), KEN (scissors), PO (paper) and KAJI (fire). The main version is the 4-player (possible partnership) game, with 2, 3 and 5-player variants.<br/><br/>In the 4-player game, 11 cards are dealt to each player and a 4-card NEKO (kitty) is set aside. There is one round of bidding where each player has one opportunity (in clockwise order) to bid on how many tricks over a book of five she will win. High bidder (Declarer) picks up the kitty, discards 4 cards and then sets trump. Declarer may elect to play the hand alone or chooses a partner by asking for a particular card. Whoever holds that card must show it and becomes the Declarer's partner. The remaining 2 players become partners. Seating order is not changed when the partnerships are formed.<br/><br/>When the KAJI suit is trump, the value of the other suits depends upon the order in which the suits are played and follow the  traditional Rock beats Scissors beats Paper beats Rock order (JAN-KEN-PO). However, if not declared trump, KAJI is always the second ranking suit (ex: if JAN is trump, suit rank is JAN-KAJI-KEN-PO). Only a higher trump card will beat another card in the trump suit.<br/><br/>Declarer leads any suit. Play proceeds clockwise in turns, and players must follow suit if possible. If a player cannot follow suit, she may play any card. If it is a card of lower suit than the previous card, it is regarded as a discard and does not change the current suit. If it is a card of a higher suit, that becomes the current suit. Say Scissors is trump and a Rock card follows a Paper card that is lead. Paper is still the suit to follow or beat. Say Scissors is trump and a Paper card follows a Rock card that is lead. Paper is now the suit ro follow or beat. The winner of each trick leads the next.<br/><br/>When playing in partnership, if the Declarer's partnership achieves or exceeds its bid, each player in the Declarer's partnership scores 5 points for each trick over the book of five that was bid and 10 points per trick over the bid if applicable. If playing alone, Declarer scores 10 points for each trick over the book of five. If Declarer's partnership does not achieve or exceed its bid, each opponent receives 10 points for each trick they fell short. If Declarere is playing alone, opponents receive 20 points for each trick by which the contract failed.<br/><br/>",

Whichever 'Player' is UP, is cross-referenced to the CARD that is drawn, and that 'Result' is what THAT 'Player' obtained. You can CALL your &quot;Team&quot; whatever you like, and you'll need a 'Scorepad'(piece of paper &amp; pencil/pen) as none was provided. There are even some 'Runners' counters to mark which 'Base' they happen to occupy during the course of an inning. The &quot;Playing Field&quot; consists of a colorful cardboard 'insert' of a &quot;Baseball Diamond&quot; within the Gamebox and should remain there during play. It has '2' &quot;Player Lineups&quot; columns(one for each of the 'Home' &amp; 'Visitor' Teams) that denote just which &quot;Player&quot; is 'Batting' in what order, and if THAT 'Player' is up to Bat(to be able to check the proper LINE on the CARD drawn).

Each card has a picture of a dog and two special objects (for example a dog playing with a ball next to a tree, or a dog next to a tree with a boat on a lake in the background). The board has a 3x3 tic-tac-toe grid with each square containing a special object picture.<br/><br/>To play, the top card of the deck is turned over for all players to see. Then a second card is turned over on top of the first. The first player to call out the matching special object on both cards places a chip on the game board space whose picture depicts the object called. If a player calls an incorrect match, the player must remove a chip. If no objects on the cards match, another card is played on top of the pile and players look for matches on it and the card just below it. The first player to get 3 chips in a row on the game board wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MATCHWITZ is the classic game of NIM presented as a green plastic tray, roughly 4&quot; x 6&quot;, through which are several rows of white plastic pegs that can be pushed to expose them one one side or the other. The pegs were arranged in three of four horizontal rows of descending length, and the horizontal rows were offset so that each peg is part of one horizontal and two diagonal rows.<br/><br/>From the package:<br/><br/>&quot;MiNi GAMES     MATCHWITZ<br/><br/>This is the ancient Oriental game of &quot;NIM&quot; in a new modern form. Part of the intrigue of this game is that it can be played over and over again without the players tiring of it. Let this game be exposed to people and it will be picked up and played. Once assembled it is a complete unit with no parts to lose and easy to carry in a pocket. Its [sic] simple rules make it easy to play.<br/><br/>To Assemble: Break off pegs from runner that joins them. Insert pegs into holes to fill board. They need not be removed again.<br/><br/>To Play: Make sure all pins are fully exposed on one side of the board. Players in their turn may push down any number of pegs in a row. They cannot play in more than one row in that turn. The player forced to push down the last remaining peg loses the game. Turn game board over and the game is ready to play again.<br/><br/>MILTON BRADLEY COMPANY<br/>SPRINGFIELD, MASSASCHUSETTS<br/>MADE IN U.S.A.&quot;<br/><br/>",

During a turn, a player puts one of his disks face down on one of 9 hexagons that are on the board. As soon as the last player has put his last disk on the board, the game ends and the scores for the 9 hexagons are calculated.

Each end of the game board had a set of buttons (i.e. offense and defense) that, depending on the combination pressed, would cause a light to illuminate next to one of the rows on the game matrix. The players would then consult the appropriate column to find out what happened.<br/><br/>This EDC game simulated a horse race.

Many of the games are known games like Chinese Checkers, Checkers, Halma, Othello and others. But this game is an invention of the author. Like all the other games is basically a DIY game, in that you get the rules, and the layout of the board, but have to provide or create our own board and counters.<br/><br/>To play Textor you will need to make 7 different counters, each in 7 duplicates, and a board (10x20 squares). The counters are placed in a bag. First player draws one counter and places it on the board along to &quot;bottom&quot; edge. After that each player takes 2 counters and places them just like tetris-bricks would fall. Each time a player makes a line across, that player scores 1 point. The game is over when a player can't place a tile.<br/><br/>",

Each character has two sets of cards - three Aches and Pains cards, and three All Better cards. For example, the three Daisy Duck Aches and Pains cards depict her head looking dizzy, her body shivering, and her feet in a tub of hot water. These all connect to form one full-body picture. The three all better cards show the same three body parts but the character is smiling and healthy. Typically, a game involves spinning a spinner that selects a character, flipping up an All Better card in hopes of finding a card for that character, and (if a match is made) placing the All Better card over the corresponding Aches and Pains card to heal the character. The &quot;Go-Along&quot; in the title references how each game increases in complexity as your child grows.<br/><br/>",

Find the matching letter - highlighted in black - on one of the post cards (like the &quot;e&quot; in Mickey) and check the mailboxes to see which name needs the letter to complete it. &quot;Deliver&quot; the post card by putting it in the mailbox slot so that the letter shows through the window. If a letter has already been delivered your turn ends. The player who delivers the most post cards wins.

        "description": "In this card game, based on the &quot;Doug&quot; TV show, players try to collect all six cards of the same color. Players are dealt 6 cards and must first bid for the color they want to collect by playing the lowest number color (character) card in their hand. If you don't have a lowest card in a suit you must wait until your next turn to try and claim a color.<br/><br/>On your turn you draw cards to bring your hand to 6, and then either play a color card onto the table in front of you, or a special card onto the discard pile. Special cards allow you to look at another player's hand and/or steal cards from it, draw from the discard pile, or stop a player from stealing your own cards. The first player to collect one card of each number (1 through 6) in the same color has brought together Doug's circle of friends and wins. Rules for a simple matching game using the cards are also included.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a very old, battery-operated electronic baseball game in which players try to outguess each other. The board depicts a baseball field dotted with lights that give the results of a play. The players use switches located at either end of the board for each pitch. For example, if the player batting presses the #2 button, and the player in the field presses the #4 button, the Strike lamp would light up, while a combination of #6 and #4 would result in the triple lamp lighting. Each player also has A and B switches that are pressed to light the Safe or Out lamps needed for the results of some plays (like if a runner tries to steal 2nd base). Wooden cubes are used to represent base runners. The player with the most runs scored at the end of 9 innings wins. Extra innings are played if needed.<br/><br/>History:<br/><br/>An application for a U.S. patent was filed in December 1927 by James M. Prentice of Holyoke, Massachusetts. Prentice was 17 years old. The patent, for &quot;Electric Baseball,&quot; was granted less than a year later, and Jim Prentice Electric Baseball, under a variety of titles and in a variety of forms, would go on to a production run of more than thirty years.<br/><br/>Prentice initially sold, or at least licensed, the rights to his invention to Parker Brothers, the game-publishing giant of nearby Salem -- probably to help fund his college tuition at the University of New Hampshire, whence he graduated with a degree in mathematics. Parkers produced Electric Base Ball Game, arguably the first electrical boardgame ever, in the very early 1930s. (Source)<br/><br/>",

Great for travel, parties or at home, in each round of the game 5 sounds are presented for children to listen to carefully and write down their best guess on the scoresheet of what the sound could be. Kids are all familiar with the sound of a 'key turning in the door' or a 'clock ticking', but can they identify it when no visual hints?

This creates a new game each time it is played because turning that knob decides which locations will have potential gold on them. Players attempt to travel the board goin up canyon streams until the player reaches a &quot;dig here&quot; spot. There may be gold at that spot or the spot may have already been worked and so there is no gold to be found and the search will have to continue using some other path.

Players decide before the game starts whether they will read through all four before replacing each card or not.

Each correct answer allows the player or team's token to be moved that many spaces.  24 seconds is recommended as the time limit for answering.  Some spaces on the board have special instructions that must be followed (lose a turn, move ahead two, that sort of thing.)

You draw an enclosed section on the Target Grid consisting of the appropriate number of boxes' of the four Spaceships with their dimensions using the black  crayons for this, and use the red ones to mark off hits and misses on the Monitor Target Tracking Grid. When the Game is finished, you can &quot;Wipe Off&quot; the current markings and you're ready to begin again-hence it's name.<br/><br/>",

On your turn you draw a card that tells you how many spaces to move the special Ferdinand pawn, and also any special instructions for the ordinary bulls (usually sending them to a specific space or an extra number of spaces). A player always moves 2 spaces after drawing a card. The first player to reach the bullring when Ferdinand arrives wins. If more than 1 player is there, they must fight by drawing cards and the highest total of numbers on a card wins. If Ferdinand reaches the bullring first, the first player to join him wins.<br/><br/>",

Having repulsed this invasion, the Greeks undertook their own march in return. Since then the Asia Minor cities and fortresses being defended by Persian garrisons would often see Greek attacks. Thus the Greeks could defend one and the same city from the Persian army and then the Persians would defend it but this time from the Greek and Macedonian armies.<br/><br/>Zvezda 8206<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game players take on the roll of firefighters. The board depicts streets and house locations (4 small houses and 1 large central public building). Wooden blocks are stacked on the structure locations to depict the buildings. Each building has a number: 2-2, 3-3, 4-4, 5-5, and the large building is both 1-1 and 6-6.<br/><br/>On a turn you roll the dice, and if you throw doubles, you remove the roof of the building with the matching number to expose the red surface underneath indicating a fire. You may then move your trucks the number indicated - either 1 truck the total amount thrown, or both trucks each using a number from one of the dice. You must throw doubles before you can move (thus starting a fire), but after that you can move regardless of what you roll. Each time a double of a house already on fire is rolled, a block from that building is removed.<br/><br/>To put out a fire, both spaces in front of a building must be occupied by a fire engine. Each truck then scores points equal to the remaining number of blocks for that building. If you own both fire engines, the second truck scores double points as a bonus. The large central building is also worth double points (or quadruple points if both fire engines are yours). The player with the highest score after ALL buildings have caught fire and been put out wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In addition to providing mature entertainment, Fantoccini has value in the learning process for college and theater drama groups, and in institutions where the acting-out of conflicts or 'play acting' is a desired form of therapy.&quot;<br/><br/>Game consists of: &quot;Gameboard with the scene area in the center, the revision wing at the left, and the score sheet on the right; 150 scene cards with green, blue, or yellow backing which color-correspond to columns on the board's scene area; 180 player cards player cards with red backing which color-correspond to the red columns on the board's scene area; 36 square revision cards; two Grand Thespian Certificates; and 16 Fantoccini invitation tickets, each admitting a couple to your party. These properties will allow for two complete Fantoccini parties.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The object of Fantoccini is to become Grand Thespian...the first player who has filled all 12 squares on the scoresheet by acting 6 times, having Authored twice, having been Wardrobe Lady twice, and having been Critic-Censor twice.&quot;<br/><br/>Players write their names on the blank side of 6 red cards. The revision cards are dealt equally to all players. Each color-coded deck is shuffled separately and placed face down. Place scene and player cards face down on the first free row of the scene area in the proper colors (green, red, blue, red, blue, red, blue, yellow).<br/><br/>Reveal the scene by turning over the cards on the row, announcing the scene as it unfolds. The green card establishes where the scene is played. The red and blue cards define the actor and their role (duplicate red cards are replaced with another red card so that there are 3 different actors). The green card establishes the players' motivation. For example, In a bomb shelter, Bob (a prim spinster of 30), Marge (a raspy throated dice player) and Hank (a politician) are saving a life. The three actors go into another room and prepare the scene (should run 2 - 3 minutes).<br/><br/>Players bid for Author (may reassign roles or replace a scene card), Wardrobe Lady (provides costume items) and Censor-Critic (an arbiter of whether or not the scene will be played and judge of the scene's quality based on audience response and the critic's opinion).<br/><br/>The scene is played (or not, based on the Critic), evaluated and participation tallied. Lay out a new scene face down on the next free row and continue with new scenes until a player tallies all 12 squares on the wipe-off score area and is declared the Grand Thespian.<br/><br/>",

The guard with the 3 cards it protects forms a set. The cards are distributed equally amongst the players. On a turn, you may ask any player for a fruit provided that you yourself hold either a fruit or the guard from that set. If the player has the fruit asked for, he must give it up, unless he has the guard of that fruit; for example, if one player asks another for an apple which he has, if he also holds the dog, he may refuse, saying, &quot;My apples are guarded by my dog.&quot;<br/><br/>You continue calling for fruit until you call on a person who either doesn't have any or has the guard for that set. Once stopped, all players draw 2 cards from the player to their left. Guards cannot be called away, but since they are frequently passed, their location is often doubtful. When you collect all 4 cards in a set, you lay them down in front of you. The player with the most sets at the end is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each player also receives 10 chips to use as money.<br/><br/>The dealer draws the top 4 cards from the blue deck and they are paired up their duplicates from the player's red cards and removed from the game. Then a trading round commences in which players may buy or sell their red cards at whatever price in chips they can agree to. After 3 minutes, the trading round ends and another 4 blue cards are drawn, paired, and removed from the game, followed by another round of trading and so on.<br/><br/>When only 1 red card is left, it is paired with the Boom card and a scoring round begins. The player in possession of the Boom card scores 25 points. In addition, all players score 1 point for each chip they have in excess of their starting 10. The cards are then dealt again for a new hand. The game is won by the first player scoring 75 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game, simulating the American gridiron version of football, comes with a game board representing a football field, a football pin, two pins with colored heads to be used as a 10 yard marker, a dice cup and two dice. As in real football the object is to advance the ball over the opponents goal line for a score. Dice rolls are used for all aspects of the game. The kickoff, for example, travels a distance equal to 5 times the throw of the dice. The receiving player then rolls the dice for the return; if it's an even number, the ball is brought back the number of yards rolled, but if it's an odd number no gain is made. The offense may choose either a Line Plunge, an End Run, a Forward Pass, or a Trick Play. The greater a play's potential for gain, the greater risk of no gain or a loss of yards. A roll of doubles results in either a penalty or a turnover. When the time limit agreed upon by the players (before the game) is reached, the player who has the highest total score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The audio tape narrates the story and tells the players how far to move and whether it's day or night. Players flip a Transformation Disk to see if they are allowed to move that turn (depending on if they're turned to stone). The first player to reach the spell book at the end of the track is the winner.<br/><br/>Game #2 is a dexterity game in which the villains have stolen computer disks that would let them create Gargoyle robots. The villain targets are set up on the locations indicated on the board. Each player takes a Gargoyle Glider. Whenever the narrator identifies a target (Xanatos, Demona or The Pack) you aim at that villain and toss your glider at it. The player whose glider lands closest to the designated target takes one computer disk token. The first player to collect three computer disks wins.<br/><br/>",

The rules on the box are rather difficult to understand, though they are brief. Figuring out what these rules mean would require attempting to play the game without understanding it at all. From the box, but really incomprehensible (grammar and spelling mistakes in the original!):<br/><br/>&quot;2. - Player may take any item to start with but not jump or land on any item from then on.<br/><br/>3. - When an item lands on 'C' square player draws a card:<br/>  A. If own item place face up in front of player.<br/>  B. If an opponents item, give them the card which they place face up in front of them.<br/>  C. If card from position not being played place face down in discard pile.<br/>  D. If a Missed Payment card take item back to start.<br/>  E. If a Paid off Mortgage card take item to finish position. Home!<br/>  F. If you draw an opponents Open House card give them the card and you get 3 rolls of the die. (3 extra turns).<br/><br/>4. - The only time an item is safe is when the player has the card face up in front of them.<br/><br/>5. - The exact number must be rolled to get into the Bank as well as Home and if all items reach finish position before player has all their cards, they draw a card on their turn until they have all five cards. If a Missed Payment card or  Paid off Mortgage card is draw, disregard and place in discard pile. If you draw an opponents card rule 3B applies and if an opponent draws your card Rule 4 applies and the item starts over.<br/><br/>6. - If all the cards are used up and there is no winner reshuffle the cards, place back in the Estate and continue following the above rules until there is a winner.&quot;<br/><br/>",

There are also cards for algae and muck that do not have numbers.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of 7 cards.  Each turn a layer must either start a new food chain by playing any card in front of themselves  or add to any one existing food chain by playing a card that the smallest creature can eat and/or a card that can eat the largest creature in that chain.  The player takes control of any food chain they add to.  The player then draws back up to 7 cards.  This continues until all of the cards have been played.

Playing Psilink will actually train and improve a child's memory as well as test and increase their word power. Psilink also won Prestigious Design Awards in Hong Kong and was featured and sold along side with Galaxion at the Hong Kong Trade Development Council's Design Gallery. All other card games can be put aside, in favour of using Psilink Cards. Psilink is ultimately superb, allowing for all known traditional card games to be played with deeper combinations and colours and strategies, as well as proving the memory. Psilink truly is The Future and is also dedicated to God, The Creator of our memories and The True Designer of Colour and Geometry, The True Author of Words and Numbers - Amen with JESUS.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kippy Koo appears to be the forerunner of &quot;Trouble&quot; as it predates the children's classic by 9 years. The game is subtitled: &quot;Indian Racing Game&quot; and has a pasted on Native American theme in which the marbles represent braves having a race to determine which tribe is superior. The board layout and game play is similar to Trouble with a few exceptions. For example, instead of the Pop-o-matic die, you use 2 dice for movement. Since you need to roll a 6 to start a marble on the track, you can use a 6 on either die or the total of the two. Like backgammon, you can move 2 pieces by using the number on each die, or move 1 piece by using the total on both. If you roll doubles, you get to take an additional turn. Finally, in Kippy Koo, a marble need only cross the finish line to exit the board (no exact rolling is needed).<br/><br/>",

The cards (25 recipe and 10 Purple Pieman) are shuffled and dealt into 3 stacks in the middle of the table. On your turn, you draw a card from any stack and place it face up in front of you. If it's a Recipe card, you may either keep it by turning it face down, or you may continue drawing until you either decide to stop, or draw a Purple Pieman card. If you draw a Purple Pieman, you lose any face up recipe cards you have in front of you. The game ends when there are no more cards to draw.

Only about 20 pgs contain the actual rules. The game appears to cover only one battle, broken into four scenarios with the campaign game being the last. Battle of Ravenna is unique in that it is the only Ad Technos game to ever have a mounted mapboard. It is very similar to what Avalon Hill used the early 90&rsquo;s with similar results (bowing of the map).<br/><br/>The counters each have five numbers on them-firepower, melee, movement and some sort of morale values (written as either + or -). There are a bunch of strength point counters as well to go along with the roster sheets. Most of the counters are in Japanese script. Units must face a vertex, with limited front facing allowed depending on the unit type. Many of the rules look to involve the firing and targeting of the various units, including cavalry charges and the ability of units to react to that.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Samas&quot; is a simple abstract 2-player racing game that incorporates a &quot;Paper-Scissors-Stone &quot; mechanic to determine which player is allowed to move on the track towards the finishing space.<br/><br/>The board consists of a single track with 9 hollows. Each player places their Sama-stone on the second hole from their baseline. Both players also get 13 stones in their color, and 2  joker-stones. All these stones are kept hidden behind the player's screens.<br/><br/>Every turn each player secretly selects 0 to 3 regular stones, or a joker-stone. These are then simultaneously revealed, the Sama-stone of the player with the winning selection moves one place towards the opponent's side, and the stone-selection of both players are removed from play.<br/><br/>If both players reveal the same stone-selection, then these stones are still removed from play, but neither Sama-stone gets moved forwards. If a player runs out of stones then the opponent's Sama-stone moves 1 space forwards for each regular stone still in this player's reserve.<br/><br/>So what makes a winning selection? A selection of regular stones gets beaten by a higher amount of regular stones. A joker-stone beats any amount of regular stones. However, if a joker-stone is played when the opponent decided to play no stones at all, than it in turn is beaten.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player reaches the opposite side of the board, or until a player runs out of stones to play. The winner is predictably the player who reaches, or gets closest to, the other side of the board.<br/><br/>Publishing history: Together with &quot;Trio Trio&quot;, &quot;Samas&quot; was the first of Frank's designs to get published (in 2004) in the deluxe wooden format that typifies the Clemens Gerhards range. Up until then Frank Stark had been making mainly card games, &quot;Zoom&quot; being the only boardgame that had found a (different) publisher. However, since then Frank Stark's boardgame designs have become regular additions to the Clemens Gerhards stable, all in the same high-quality make-up that they do so well.<br/><br/>",

A team has 3 stacks of cups (the size and shape of typical party cups) that are positioned about 1 foot apart. To begin you must make 3 pyramids, one at a time, with your 3 stacks (2 outer 3-cup pyramids and a central 6-cup one). You must then convert each pyramid back down to the original stacks of cups. The first person to finish down-stacking wins. If a pyramid collapses while it is being built, it must be corrected before moving on to the next. However, if a fumble occurs during the down-stacking process, you may continue to down stack without having to rebuild the pyramid. The game has rules for one-on-one and relay race competition, and also stacking tips. <br/> Kup Stax is actually mentioned in the &quot;Grade 5 Physical Education Required Curriculum&quot; as a way for students to &quot;demonstrate perceptual motor efficiency&quot;.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Crazy-Cups<br/><br/><br/>",

On your turn, you spin the spinner and move along any of the paths the number indicated trying to avoid Big Bad Wolf spaces. Some Big Bad Wolf spaces send you backwards, some cause you to lose a turn, some make you spin the number on the space before you can move on. The first player to reach the last Big Bad Wolf space at the end of the paths wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a children's track game that teaches young players math and spelling skills. The game features a wooden School House in the center of the board, beneath which a question disk is inserted. On your turn, you draw an Arithmetic Card and read the equation (such as 8-2=6). If moving 6 spaces would land you on a Question space, you must move there, otherwise you may move from 1-6 spaces (your choice) and land on a Letter space. If you land on a Letter space, you take a corresponding Letter Tile from the box. You can use the letters to form words and turn them in for Star Tokens - the longer the word, the more Stars you earn. If you land on a Question Space, you turn the School House to rotate the question disk, then read the question appearing in the board window. If you answer the question correctly, you receive a Star. The first player to reach the FINISH space ends the game and receives a three Star bonus. The player with the most Stars is the winner.<br/><br/>",
