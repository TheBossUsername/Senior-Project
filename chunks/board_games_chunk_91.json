It's a sequel in that it's a whole bunch of new Fluxx cards for the fans who've been craving new stuff, which can be combined with the original or enjoyed standalone; it's a retread in that the core game is the same, and many of the &quot;new&quot; Keepers and Goals are cards that have previously been seen in promo card form or in earlier editions of the game; and it's an experiment in that we're interested in seeing how well people like this leaner, simpler, smaller version of the game. Also, Fluxx Reduxx (and Family Fluxx, too) will feature a couple of cool all-new Action cards we've been trying out lately, these being Jackpot! (which lets you draw 3 more cards right away) and Choose a New Rule (which lets you seek out and play your favorite rule from either the discard or draw piles, reshuffling the former into the latter thereafter).<br/><br/>Part of the Fluxx series.<br/><br/>NOTE: This may be referring to the &quot;FLUXX Special Edition&quot; originally sold exclusively at Target Stores.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's site:<br/><br/>Starship Troopers Evolution<br/>Based on the ever popular Heinlein novel and the highly successful film, this game uses the Evolution system to bring the War of the Species to your tabletop. Pre-painted Mobile Infantry, Arachnids, Skinnies and Forth miniatures will be appearing in the first wave of releases for this game, hitting your local stores in August.<br/><br/>From the publisher's monthly 'Signs &amp; Portents' magazine:<br/><br/>Starship Troopers Evolution is based on the same game system as the original, though everything has been tightened, streamlined, and developed to give a far more tactical game.  The design of the best miniatures in the old range have been retained, the others improved and, to top it all off, everything will come pre-painted, saving you the trouble of creating forces from scratch, and allowing you to get straight into the game itself.<br/><br/>Replaced<br/><br/>    Starship Troopers Miniatures Game<br/><br/><br/>",

The player who has collected the most figures at the end of the text wins the game.<br/><br/>Variants include just putting the figures into the box after they were mentioned (non-competitive play) and a memory variant in which objects that were put away before the game have to be called out when mentioned in the story.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A &quot;race game&quot; placed in the ancient Roman Empire. Each player leads an expedition along the &quot;Amber Road&quot; to gain worthy resources along the travel.<br/><br/>Moving along the Road consumes resources such as water, food, etc. The first thing an expedition needs to do is fill up its supplies. While still in the starting area, a player may take up to four resource tokens and/or coins; he may stay as long in this starting area and take resources as he wants. When a player thinks he has enough for the journey, he takes off.<br/>In a turn, a player has three options: spend two tokens and move one step for each ox you have; move one step without spending tokens; or remain where he is.<br/>If a player moves to a new mapboard, he has to roll the stick beforehand to see which board is placed. After this each player has the option to place a village marker.<br/>On each map section the terrain changes; on a number of special places a player may perform different useful tasks, such as refilling his supply of water, food or acquire an ox.<br/><br/>Villages are useful to buy supplies. Markers that show the 'pax' side consider the village to be friendly, however, when the village is hostile, it attacks the expedition. All oxes and scout then are placed in the bag together with three neutral green tokens. Two tokens drawn from the bag are considered lost.<br/>If the village is friendly, the stick is rolled. The dots shown is the number of resource tokens a player gets for each silver coin in this village.<br/>When the first player reaches the end of the road by exact count, he wins.<br/><br/>",

To do this, they will face a hard ascension of the ancient Sneffels volcano, a descent into its dark and misterious insides and finally a nightmarish counter-clock run against the lava flowing in the center of the Earth. During the journey they might face dangerous secondary adventures but also find precious treasures. But beware! Only those adventurers to equip themselves with the right object for each stage of the journey will be able to successfully race against the others.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Three Famous Battles&quot; contains three short wargames covering (as the name suggests) three famous battles. The scenarios included are Lee at Gettysburg, Senlac: Hastings 1066, and The Emperor Strikes Back: Waterloo. The scenarios all use a common rule set but are meant to build on each other. Each scenario adds rules from the previous scenario (Gettysburg is the simplest scenario and The Emperor Strikes Back: Waterloo is the most complicated.)<br/><br/>The turns in each scenario are played in the following sequence:<br/>Gettysburg: Player A = Confederate, Player B = Union<br/>Senlac: Player A = Saxon, Player B = Norman<br/>Waterloo: Player A = British, Player B = French<br/>1. Reinforcements for both players<br/>2. Player A Movement<br/>3. Player B Defensive Fire/Combat<br/>4. Player A Offensive Fire/Combat<br/>5. Player B Movement<br/>6. Player A Defensive Fire/Combat<br/>7. Player B Offensive Fire/Combat<br/>8. Victory Check<br/><br/>Victory in each scenario is determined by a set number of unit losses. For example, in the Gettysburg scenario, the first player to eliminate five of his/her opponent's pieces is the winner. The victory rules for the other games are slightly more complicated but are still based on number of unit losses.<br/><br/>The rules for each scenario are under two pages. The game is designed to introduce people to wargaming but also be complex enough to be enjoyed by experienced wargamers looking for a fast playing game.<br/><br/>",

Players select a character at the beginning of the game and try to get them to California in one piece...literally. In Westerly things can go from bad to worse in a matter of minutes and your character can be injured, maimed, left to die by the group or maybe just eaten by a bear or even your own party. Ayup that's right I'm talking about cannibalism. Fear not if it all goes wrong you can rejoin the party as a different character that hops into the wagon at the next town.<br/><br/>The game involves strategy and co-operation combined with a tongue in cheek approach to all the horrible things that can happen along the perilous route out west.<br/><br/>Tiles are played in order to navigate the group to California. The game space is split into three different tracks North, South and West. Encounter cards are drawn depending on which track the group is currently in. The group must then work together to select the best way to deal with the encounter and either reap the benefits or pay the consequences of their selection.<br/><br/>The road is treacherous filled with bandits, angry natives, predators, environmental dangers, and the list goes on. Westerly is comedic one minute and brutal the next. You never know what the exact party make up will be or what route you will have to take to go west.<br/><br/>Westerly is all about the story of you and your friends trying their best to make it out west and all the ridiculous things that can go wrong along the way. If ya manage to get there you will absolutely have a wild story to tell.<br/><br/>",

It has fighters, cruisers, dreadnoughts, space stations and more.<br/><br/>Play is for 1 or 2 players.<br/><br/>It's easy to learn (maybe 15 minutes), setup takes about 5 minutes and play lasts less than an hour.<br/><br/>Features 216 double-sided tokens, representing a dozen different types of spaceships from small to huge!<br/><br/>You also get to fly round planets in proper orbits and everything.<br/><br/>The game mechanic is really simple, although it does follow proper space physics, its not complicated or hard - in fact it is very simple - very like the old dot-and-dash style games you might have played already.<br/><br/>Spaceships have a vector. They will fly on that vector forever. Applying thrust changes the vector.<br/><br/>The combat process is in the same vein as games like Ogre, Battle of the Bulge, and any Avalon Hill type hex-and-counter wargame.<br/><br/>Each unit has an attack range and strength.  No dice involved.  The defending unit loses a number of components based on the attack strength. Shields help defeat attacks.  Defender chooses what gets damaged and this is not revealed.<br/><br/>",

The youngest player begins the game and takes a turn. A turn means they 1) roll the dice and reroll and 2) perform the roll results. After a turn, the next player takes their turn going anticlockwise, and so on. Every time the tour guide takes their turn, a new day of travel begins. The tour guide moves the calendar marker forward to the next day.<br/><br/>",

Landing a pawn exactly on one of four points on the track allows the player to hop that pawn along those four points, for a large shortcut.  Also, should the player roll a one, the pawn can move into the center for an even greater shortcut, since that pawn may exit to the final shortcut point before its home.  A pawn occupying a space to which an opponent's pawn is moving becomes &quot;aggravated&quot; and sent back to base.  Unlike Pachisi, there is no opportunity to form blockades for safety of the pawns and obstruction of the path.<br/><br/>",

Whoever does this first wins.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player draws six seeds from the seed pouch at random and places them on front of the six slots on their 3D game board. On a turn, a player draws and reveals the top card. If it's a fruit or veggie and they have the matching colored seed, they can place this card in their game board in the slot next to the seed. If they lack this colored seed, they can swap one of their seeds with a seed drawn at random from the bag; if this now matches the card, they can plant it; otherwise they must discard the card.<br/><br/>Players might also draw a &quot;Pick it!&quot; card that allows them to steal a card from another player's garden, a &quot;Pest&quot; card that eats one card in your garden, or a &quot;Helper&quot; card that allows you to draw two cards, after which you play both.<br/><br/>Players continue taking turns until one of them has all six fruits and veggies in their garden, winning the game instantly.<br/><br/>",

The assumption is that they instead chose to evacuate as much of the French Army as possible to France d&rsquo;Outre Mer (Algeria). The resultant campaign, then, is one of strategic retreat and pursuit. The German player must try to destroy as much of the evacuating French force as possible, while keeping his own losses to a minimum in doing so.<br/><br/>Both sides&rsquo; orders of battle are entirely historical. The game length is held to only one month because, had the Germans not triumphed in that amount of time, the delay thereby caused to their plans for the next year would&rsquo;ve then amounted to a major defeat in itself in the wider war.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents two days.

On each turn, a player draws until they have five cards in their hand, and then plays cards from either their hand, a top card from their discard piles, or their stockpile. At the end of their turn, a player must discard onto one of their four personal discard piles.<br/><br/>Included in this version is the new MOD die. At the start of your turn roll the die. Three sides depict numbers that you can use the dice in place of that numbered card. One side is a Skip-Bo you can use as a wild. One side lets you discard two cards on your turn instead of one and the last side makes your opponent draw one card to add to their stockpile.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Doppelt und Dreifach is an abstract card game by an anonymous author. It consists of cards numbered 2-15, with higher numbers being rarer. Each player holds six cards at the beginning. In clockwise order, players play one card each. If it is higher than any other card currently on the table, the lower card is discarded and the player who had played it has to draw a new card. However, if two or more players play the same number, the card values are cumulated. When it's a player's turn and their card is still in front of them, they can discard it without redrawing. First player(s) to get rid of their cards wins.<br/><br/>Doppelt und Dreifach was anonymously sent to various people in March, 2016. The rules or the box give no hint at the identity of the designer, publisher or point of origin. In July, Friedemann Friese revealed that he was the designer (<a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/210813/futschikato-story-must-be-told\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/210813/futschikato-story-...</a>).<br/><br/>",

The two nations clashed for over a decade, with each experiencing triumphs and defeats. Following the Battle of the Great Plains in 203 BC, a ceasefire was negotiated. It was broken following a Carthaginian attack on a stranded Roman fleet in the Gulf of Tunis. Determined to finally win the war, Roman General Scipio Africanus led an invasion force into North Africa, the Carthaginian homeland. The opposing armies met near the town of Zama. Despite being outnumbered, the Romans were able to defeat the Carthaginians. With that victory the Romans had effectively won the war.<br/><br/>Zama is part of DG&rsquo;s Battles of the Ancient World series, that emphasizes simple but realistic design features to show critical aspects of classical era combat. Special rules for leadership, missile fire, and elephants are included.<br/><br/>",

The side deck cards can be used to modify the player's current total, i.e. adding 1, subtracting 3, etc. The side deck is built by each player before the game, but at the beginning of the game, only the top 4 cards become the player's hand.<br/><br/>Each player takes turns, which includes drawing a card from the draw pile, adding that to the other cards already drawn/played by the player, then the player may either play a card from their hand, end turn, or stand (not taking and not playing anymore cards).<br/><br/>Each round ends with each player either standing or when a player ends his turn with a total over 20 (similar to busting in blackjack).<br/><br/>The person closest to 20 without going over wins the round. In the case of a tie, neither player wins. After one player wins 3 times, the game is over.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The main idea is, NATO devolves toward operational ineffectiveness and, on that basis, old Vladimir decides to try for the big solution to get back all the former Soviet Union's western borderlands.<br/><br/>In designing the game (already done despite the long wait for its publication), I came up with a new system that emphasizes the following perspective: today's First World militaries are part way through a systemic transformation broadly comparable to the one they went through during the 1930s.<br/><br/>The issue in the 30s was how to integrate mechanization into what otherwise still remained foot-slogging, horse-drawn armies. The debate centered around how much horse cavalry to keep mixed in with the tanks, trucks and other combat vehicles. The idea was the large mass of unmotorized units would form a &quot;base of maneuver&quot; from which the relatively more scarce -- but elite -- moto-mech units would operate.<br/><br/>Of course, by the war's midpoint all that had been settled. The question had come to center on determining the optimal mix of tracked and wheeled vehicles, etc.<br/><br/>Today, we're witnessing a similar transformation in that the former moto-mech elite has, in effect, taken on the role of the previous era's foot-sloggers and horse cavalry: they're now the new &quot;base of maneuver&quot; element, holding the line while, evolving atop and past them, is the new elite: the special forces, which are themselves increasingly robot-equipped.<br/><br/>Given that the cost and social advantages involved in deploying small elites rather than the mass mechanized armies of the previous era (the draft isn't going to come back), I see us now at about the 1938-equivalent in terms of the new transition.<br/><br/>Aside from that, another characteristic is more and more of the First World's armies combat experience is increasingly contained within the personnel of the SoF. That, of course, further enhances their relative combat power.<br/><br/>To smoothly model all that, I've come up a system I've titled the &quot;Big And Dumb Armies Super System&quot; (BADASS). I'll be using it again.<br/><br/>This design will be appearing in Modern War issue number 29 (May-June 2017).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simple card game about fruit warriors<br/><br/>Players compete in creating unique fruit cocktails. They use the unique skills of brave fruit fighters to make their own cocktail even better or spoil your opponents. Every Wojowoc is different and unique in its own way. Only a clever combination of their capabilities will give this unique effect that you are looking for. Wojowoce, is a simple card game that gives so many possibilities during the game, that will provide a lot of fruity fun for dozens of games.<br/><br/>Create the best fruit cocktail and do not be outdone by other players.<br/><br/>The game in &quot;Wojowoce&quot; begins with preparing the deck for the game. For the game, we choose one deck more than we have players at the table (there are a total of 6 decks in the game). Cards are mixed, we give away to players, and among the last cards we place the Heat card signaling the end of the party.<br/><br/>During the game, we play the card, effect it, place it in our game area (cocktail) in the same color fruit column and draw 1 card from the general deck (basket). There are four types of card effects in the game - attack, power (immediate effect), effect (permanent effect) and the reaction that we can play in response to the opponent's attack.<br/><br/>At the moment of getting the advantage over the opponents in the number of fruits in one color, we obtain a corresponding card providing additional points, however this bonus is transitive and we can lose it along with the loss of advantage for another player.<br/><br/>The game ends with a round after drawing the Heat card from the deck. At the end of the game, we count points on the cards in our Cocktail, points from the above-mentioned bonus cards for the advantage and after point for each card in hand. The player with the highest number of victory points won wins.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPOLISH VERSION BELOWProsta gra karciana o owocowych wojownikach<br/><br/>Gracze prze≈õcigajƒÖ siƒô w tworzeniu niepowtarzalnych koktajli owocowych.

        "description": "Glider-Pit Gladiators (GPG) is a free print-and-play board game of ancient aerial combat. The latest version (GPG 2002) is available for download from the files section below.<br/><br/>Two to six players control primitive gliders descending into a deep, sheer-walled pit. Within this natural arena the glider pilots engage in ritualistic gladiatorial combat. A combination of martial and flying skills is required for victory. Every decision a player makes, from the selection of weapons to the anticipation of fickle air currents, helps determine whether a gladiator is on the road to glory -- or disaster.<br/><br/>The object of the game is simply to have the last glider airborne. The game features a variable player turn order (depending on the altitude and speed of each glider), five different types of weapons (including missile weapons and nets), risky ramming attacks, and up/down drafts. Players have the option of controlling more than one glider (up to three when playing with only two players). The game can be played as a competition between two or three teams of gliders, or as a &quot;last man flying&quot; free-for-all.<br/><br/>An experimental Campaign Expansion allows you to play a continuing gladiator character. The expansion includes rules for special abilities and advantages, character survival, and experience. Gladiator characters who survive a match (and aren't crippled in the process) receive experience and a chance to gain special abilities and advantages. Gladiators who are victorious are more likely develop skills that will help them gain future victories in the arena. A procedure for randomly generating experienced gladiator characters is also described.<br/><br/>Glider-Pit Gladiators was originally designed (under a deadline of a month or two) for the online 1998 Microgame Design Contest held via the Yahoo Groups Microgame Mailing List. The game was updated under the name Glider-Pit Gladiators 2002 (GPG 2002) for the second micro-game design competition. The 2002 update focused on cleaning up the rules and making improvements to the spartan components.<br/><br/>",

The types of winning collections (and the collection size limits) vary based on the number of players. Easily collected animals offer a smaller bonus than rarer beasts. Event cards and co-location both dictate whether a player successfully captures an animal for his collection.<br/><br/>In a single game, the first player to complete a collection will almost always end up with the most money even with the smallest award -able bonus. However, a series of games can be played which raises the importance of the value of one's collection.<br/><br/>Players may travel slowly on foot within a territory, and more quickly all over the board by plane. The more distant the target location, the more expensive the flight.<br/><br/>Animals may also be sold prior to the end of the game to gain working capital. This is necessary in some cases when a player spends his money flying across the board for a prize animal, only to have another player in the same location draw a &quot;capture&quot; card first from the event card deck.<br/><br/>For the most part, the game is also educational. Each animal card offers background on the particular animal. One exception is the humorous &quot;Lesser-Spotted Swamp Dragon&quot; card added in for a bit of humor.<br/><br/><br/>     David Attenborough's TV program<br/><br/><br/>",

He does so by collecting appropriate organisms as he moves around the game board, confronting the problems of water pollution each time he lands on a 'pollution' triangle. Throughout the game he must learn to anticipate possible pollution of his lake, attempt to avoid the problem of overpopulation, manage his finances efficiently, and consider the problem of possible pollution coming from upstream. A player wins the game by controlling water pollution successfully and thereby being the first to completely stock his lake.&quot;<br/><br/>Each player is the Commissioner of Water Pollution for their own lake.  Each lake is connected by a series of rivers and surrounded by potential polluters.  The first player to completely stock his lake with organisms while controlling the pollution from the nearby community of farms, industries and residential developments is the winner.  Clean Water acquaints players with some of the complexities involved with dealing different types of pollutants while maintaining a healthy ecosystem.<br/><br/>Players roll a die to move around the board and collect organisms for their lakes. Landing on a pollution space will kill off some of the higher organisms and increase the lower organisms, but players can purchase Abatement cards to try to avoid the pollution. Overpopulation of any one type of critter will also disturb the ecology, but players can occasionally exchange lower organisms for higher ones. Players also have opportunities to bid for federal funding. The first player to fill his lake with the required organisms wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Hass was a scuba-diving pioneer, and with his beautiful wife Lotte was well-known in the 1950s for his underwater photography and film-making.<br/><br/>Each player is a diver competing to bring to the surface the greatest number and value of sea creatures (and some treasure!).  The deeper the dive, the greater the rewards, but also the greater the risk of losing the catch from unwelcome events or robbery by another player.  Returning to their ship makes the diver's catch safe, but takes time, and the next dive may be limited to shallower waters where there is less to find.<br/><br/>The catch is represented by cards of differing values, with bonuses if sets are collected, including some dangerous creatures scoring negative points.  Most show an interesting underwater photo.  There are also Action (event) cards and Diving Equipment cards, that determine how deep each dive can go.<br/><br/>The board has a disc underneath, and when this is rotated different colors show through holes punched in the top board.  Each turn the player takes the action determined by the color at the current location of their diver pawn - take a number of value cards, an event card or a &quot;dangerous&quot; card - and then hopes to move somewhere else to collect more value cards.  The disc is rotated each time cards are taken, and the holes are far enough apart that the change of color is unpredictable.  There is a die, but its main use is to determine the outcome of robberies.<br/><br/>",

Each round, the active player draws a Description card (which features an adjective like &quot;Hairy&quot; or &quot;Smarmy&quot;) from the deck, then the other players each secretly choose the Thing card in hand that best matches that description and plays it face-down on the table. The active player then reveals these cards and chooses the Thing card that, in his opinion, best matches the Description card, which he awards to whoever played that Thing card. This player becomes the new active player for the next round.<br/><br/>Once a player has won a pre-determined number of Description cards, that player wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary:<br/>Pirates Code is a game of deduction and bluffing. There are 14 cards, each numbered 1 through 14, and 12 of them are dealt to players evenly. The remaining 2 cards compose a cipher of the treasure cache. A player wins the game by specifying the correct numbers of these 2 cards.<br/><br/>Each card has its own ability to help gain some clues about the treasure cache. But using the ability comes with a risk of revealing clues to other players. Players have to weigh the risk and the benefit when playing a card.<br/><br/>When a player is sure they have enough clues, it's time for them to declare the codes. The player wins if they are correct. If another player says they have one of the declared numbers, the declaration fails. The declared player misses one turn, but they don't get eliminated, and at least they gain a clue that another player has one. Therefore players may declare codes without enough clues, and experienced players will find out other benefits from early declaration.<br/><br/>„Äå„Éë„Ç§„É¨„Éº„ÉÑ„Ç≥„Éº„Éâ„Äç„ÅØÊé®ÁêÜ„Å®„Éñ„É©„Éï„ÅÆ„Ç≤„Éº„É†„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ<br/>1ÔΩû14„ÅÆÁï™Âè∑„ÅåÊõ∏„Åã„Çå„Åü14Êûö„ÅÆ„Ç´„Éº„Éâ„ÅÆ„ÅÜ„Å°„ÄÅ12Êûö„Çí„Éó„É¨„Ç§„É§„Éº„Å´ÂùáÁ≠â„Å´ÈÖç„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇÊÆã„Å£„Åü2Êûö„ÅØË≤°ÂÆù„ÅÆÈö†„ÅóÂ†¥ÊâÄ„ÇíÁ§∫„ÅôÊöóÂè∑„Å®„Å™„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Åì„ÅÆ2Êûö„ÅÆÁï™Âè∑„ÇíÊ≠£„Åó„ÅèË®Ä„ÅÑÂΩì„Å¶„Åü„Éó„É¨„Ç§„É§„Éº„ÅåÂãùËÄÖ„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ<br/>„Ç´„Éº„Éâ„Å´„ÅØ„Åù„Çå„Åû„ÇåÁã¨Ëá™„ÅÆÂäπÊûú„Åå„ÅÇ„Çä„ÄÅË≤°ÂÆù„ÅÆÈö†„ÅóÂ†¥ÊâÄ„Å´Èñ¢„Åô„ÇãÊâã„Åå„Åã„Çä„ÅåÂæó„Çâ„Çå„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Åó„Åã„Åó„ÄÅ„Åù„Çå„Å´„ÅØÁõ∏Êâã„Å´Êâã„Åå„Åã„Çä„Çí‰∏é„Åà„Çã„É™„Çπ„ÇØ„ÇÇ‰ªò„Åç„Åæ„Å®„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Ç´„Éº„Éâ„Çí‰ΩøÁî®„Åô„ÇãÈöõ„ÅØ„ÄÅ„Åì„ÅÆ„É™„Çπ„ÇØ„Å®„É™„Çø„Éº„É≥„ÇíÊ∏¨„ÇãÂøÖË¶Å„Åå„ÅÇ„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ<br/>ÂçÅÂàÜ„Å™Êâã„Åå„Åã„Çä„ÇíÂæó„Çâ„Çå„Åü„Å®Á¢∫‰ø°„Åó„Åü„Çâ„ÄÅÊöóÂè∑„ÇíÂÆ£Ë®Ä„Åó„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ„Åù„ÅÆÊöóÂè∑„ÅåÊ≠£„Åó„Åë„Çå„Å∞ÂãùÂà©„Åó„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇÊ≠£„Åó„Åè„Å™„Åè„Å¶„ÇÇ1„Çø„Éº„É≥„ÇíË≤ª„ÇÑ„Åô„Å†„Åë„Åß„ÄÅËÑ±ËêΩ„ÅØ„Åó„Åæ„Åõ„Çì„ÄÇ„Åù„ÅÆ„Åü„ÇÅ„ÄÅÂÆü„ÅØÂçÅÂàÜ„Å™Êâã„Åå„Åã„Çä„Åå„Å™„Åè„Å¶„ÇÇÂÆ£Ë®Ä„Åô„Çã„Åì„Å®„Åå„Åß„Åç„Åæ„Åô„Åó„ÄÅÁÜüÁ∑¥ËÄÖ„ÅØ„Åì„ÅÆÂÆ£Ë®Ä„Çí‰ªñ„ÅÆÁõÆÁöÑ„Åß‰Ωø„ÅÜ„Åì„Å®„ÇíÊÄù„ÅÑ„Å§„Åè„Åß„Åó„Çá„ÅÜ„ÄÇ<br/><br/>Publisher summary:<br/>Pirates Code is a deduction card game without player elimination, where you can hide a trap inside your deduction (the literal translation of Êé®ÁêÜ„ÅÆÂΩ±„Å´ÁΩ†„Çí‰ªïËæº„ÇÄ is &quot;to set a trap in the shadow of your deduction&quot;).

        "description": "This is a wargame in which solitaire play can be fudged but is more usually played with two, whereby one (the &ldquo;Russian player&rdquo;) commands the Kremlin&rsquo;s forces and the other (the &ldquo;Allied player&rdquo;) commands the Finnish-Swedish alliance opposed to him.<br/><br/>This isn&rsquo;t a simulation of the &ldquo;opaque (a.k.a. gray) war&rdquo; techniques most recently used by the Russians in the Crimea and eastern Ukraine. Rather, it&rsquo;s designed to facilitate the examination of the strategic possibilities (along with their operational undertones) inherent in this potentially larger and more drastic situation.<br/><br/>The crisis being modeled here, though not yet much discussed, will certainly come into being if the drift of the two &ldquo;neutral&rdquo; Scandinavian nations toward NATO membership continues. That would, in turn, most likely occur if &ndash; probably in reaction to the growing Muslim in-migration crisis there &ndash; a conservative government came to power in Sweden. Part of that altered worldview in Stockholm would then likely also move that government to want to join the Western alliance. Since the Finns are already allied with Sweden (and Denmark), it&rsquo;s hard not to imagine such a shift wouldn&rsquo;t also pull Helsinki in the same direction.<br/><br/>All of which would be unacceptable to Putin. His goal here would therefore be to bring off a quick and victorious blitzkrieg-like campaign against Finland, while probably also seizing the low-hanging geo-strategic fruit of Sweden&rsquo;s Gotland Island. That would allow him to install a fully subservient government in Helsinki, turn the Baltic Sea into a Russian lake, and simultaneously recast Sweden into Finland&rsquo;s former role: a quiet and pliant neutral.<br/><br/>This game can be played as a stand-alone, or it can be used as part of a new &ldquo;Grand Campaign Scenario&rdquo; for combined play with its parent game, Putin Strikes: The Coming War for Eastern Europe Putin Strikes.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: Half Week<br/>Hex: 20 miles / 32.5 kilometers<br/>Units: Regiment to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 17 x 22&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (114 9/16 counters)<br/>One 16-page rulebook<br/>One six-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium-High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-Low<br/>Players: 1 or 2<br/>Playing Time: 2-4 hours<br/><br/>",

You can give only one answer each time.<br/><br/>The winner takes the question card as a point, draws the next card and is the reader for the next question. The first player to five points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Reach is an asymmetric two-player co-operative micro-card game featuring three-dimensional movement, momentum, hand management, and dexterity to simulate a zero gravity space rescue mission.<br/><br/>An asteroid has collided into your shuttle while the Field Engineer was performing repairs on the exterior. Their tether has broken and they are quickly losing oxygen as they begin to drift into space. They must creatively use all the tools at their disposal while the Commander makes a daring attempt to reach and save them.<br/><br/>As the Field Engineer, you can use tools for their ability, throw them to alter your momentum, or to physically extend your reach to your Commander.<br/><br/>As the Commander, you will be moving and rotating to put yourself in a position to grab your Field Engineer by the hand. You can also throw tethers and other tools to your Field Engineer, but if they aren't caught, they may be lost in space forever.<br/><br/>Every tool has an event on the other side and as tools are used, they will flip over. When these events come into your hand, you will have to apply the negative effects of it before you can use any tools. If you ever draw a hand completely full of event cards, you have run out of oxygen and the rescue mission is a failure.<br/><br/>If you manage to grab each other's hand before either player runs out of oxygen, you have survived and the game ends victoriously!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Deception Dice is a updated version of the classic pirate dice game aka Liar's Dice but with a unique feature which are the Deception Dice cubes. This is a game of strategy, luck and a bit of deception. Players must strategically blend honesty with deception when making bets for each hand as each player is at risk to lose their dice during game play. Ultimately, the dice, once revealed, will decide the winner.<br/><br/>The Deception Dice cubes get rolled into the &quot;pit&quot; to set the format of play for each hand. The red DD cube defines the number of dice at risk to the loser of the hand (i.e. 1 die or 2 dice). The green DD cube establishes the format of play (i.e. NL - No Look hand, R - reverse direction, Star - extra wild in play, etc.). The red DD indicator is bad luck (roller loses a die) and the green DD indicator is good luck (roller gets to return a previously lost die to their hand). Rolling double DD's has a special consequence! All players shake their colored dice in their shaker cup and throw down keeping their dice concealed from the others. Ones are wild and a player's turn requires a bet to be made which is based upon all the dice in play. Bets will continue to be increased until a player challenges another players bet. Once the dice get revealed, the bettor or caller will lose dice.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the last player with at least a single die. Wagering can be incorporated into the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Infunitum is a hot new party game that was debuted at the Chicago Toy &amp; Game Fair during November 2009 and it won the award for 'Best In Show - Game'.  Not suprising with an overwhelmingly favorable rating from people that have played.  The object of the game is to get to the center of the board by earning points for unique answers to topics listed on game cards.<br/><br/>One player selects a card, chooses one of the three topics listed on the card, and reads the topic aloud to the other players.  The one-minute sand timer starts and players write down as many answers as they can that relate to the chosen topic.  Each unique answer earns one point.  Each point represents a space on the game board.<br/><br/>On the way to the center of the board, there are some positive and some negative places to land.  A player may land on +3 and move three spaces ahead.  Conversely, a player may land on -3 and move three spaces back.  There is also a sad-faced character for players that land on this space, go back to start.<br/><br/>The dynamics of the game always change depending on who plays.  Topics are unique and sometimes have double, triple, or more meanings, so creativity really helps.  Infunitum is a fun party game, is excellent as an ice-breaker, and helps people get to know more about other players.<br/><br/>",

The cat cook sometimes likes to pretend to be a princess pig, and it's not uncommon to hear the frog-legs minstrel crow like a knight rooster. The only thing players can be sure of is that the animals are not always who they pretend to be! If players want to go far in the king's court, they have to know a story when they hear one and be able to keep a straight face when telling one of their own!<br/><br/>With animal cards in their hand in Flunkerk&ouml;nig, players lay them face down in turns, mimicking their sounds as often as the number of the animal appearing on the card.<br/><br/>But careful! A players' card must show a greater number of the same animal played, or at least one animal of a higher-ranking animal. If they don't have the right card in their hand, they have to keep a straight face while pretending they do! Whoever has the fewest penalty points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

The first 6 rows are safe and each player has their own along with a pit for prisoners. There are then 5 circular rows that anybody can move into and a pit in the middle for scoring.  To start the game you place 3 pieces on each of your first 4 rows. You pick a row and move all pieces in it, dropping one piece off at every row you pass. If your last piece comes to rest in a row with other of your pieces you may pick them up and move with them also. Upon getting a pawn to the middle pit you drop one in and start placing the pieces starting along row one again. If your last piece ends in a row that an opponent has a single piece in you capture it and place it in your prisoner pit. If more then one opponent has a single piece in the last row you place in you capture all of them.<br/><br/>When one player has no pieces left, through dropping them in the middle pit or being captured, the game is over. Each piece captured is worth 5 points and each piece in the middle pit is worth 10 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on information from the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Smart is about buying, selling and using Smarts in Smartcity. 'Eating' the Smarts determines your emotional situation on the Emotionhead.<br/><br/>In Smart players struggle to be the best Smartdealer and<br/>to become the owner of three new Smartshops. To do this, players buy, sell and use Smarts in the twelve neighborhoods (gameboard).<br/><br/>In trading Smarts, you compare the popularity of different types of Smarts in the various neighborhoods, your distance from the neighborhoods in which there is demand for Smarts, the amount of various Smarts others want to  sell and the amount of Euro's others bid on new Smarts.<br/><br/>Trade is connected to the four actions in every round.<br/>The Smarts you supply but don't sell are the Smarts you 'eat'. This 'eating' influences your emotional situation. How Relaxed, Dull, Hyper and Heavy you are, is indicated on the Emotionhead display. <br/>The corresponding actions can be used to improve your Smarttrade. So it's important to work on your emotional state.  Be careful of partial or even total epileptic attacks.<br/><br/>Available tactics include good bidding, good selling and good 'eating'. Doing well in one of these gives opportunities to do well in the other two. But sometimes it is important to 'take it easy'. In many cases the winner at the end doesn't sell in every round and doesn't play a large role in every auction. The best advice: play Smart!<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     A2-sized city board, painted by Annette Wiesman<br/>     real Smarts (actual candies, made of sugar, water soluble)<br/>     real half walnut shells <br/>     play Euros <br/>     Emotionhead board<br/><br/><br/>",

Movement is by dice, though players can elect to slow the ship down by using energy points, to enable them to reach specific target squares. Hyperspace Gates can also be used to perform more complex moves. Combat is resolved by a highest dice wins system. An Asteroid belt finalizes a range of encounters, from combat to entering an occupied square. There are also rules for alliances and planet hopping.<br/><br/>",

Each player has 26 cones with a value of either zero (10), 1 (5), 2 (6), 4 (4) or 8 (1) and each turn you can move one cone according to a roll of a die. You try to capture your opponents cones by landing on them, but since the value of each cone is hidden from you opponent you never quite know what you get. The game ends when one player has 28 points.<br/><br/>When moving you can only move in a straight line either horizontally, diagonally or vertically. The exception is one of your cones which has a red ring placed around it - the so called &quot;bondocone.&quot; With this you can move in any direction, but may not step on the same square twice. You can capture your opponents &quot;bondo&quot; and thus have two bondocones.<br/><br/>The game is in it's current version also a piece of designer furniture made specific to fit into trendy caf&eacute;s or as home interior design. The materials are exclusive and really adds to a great gaming experience... Nothing beats a quality game!<br/><br/>",

These are two games in one.<br/><br/>Dodecaedron 2007 is based on a hexagonal field (the Esadome) where players use their figertips to push 6 teams of superwarriors, trying to push the Dodecaedron Cap (the DOD) into the enemy goal areas and to stop the cap there (like happens in curling).<br/><br/>Scaraball has the same theme and background but is played in a totally different way.<br/>No more fingertip hits, but rather calculated movements of the warriors based on a deck of &quot;hit cards&quot; that players use to hit the DOD or other players.  Players try to get the DOD into the goal, or knock opposing players off the field.<br/><br/>You can simply push with violence the DOD in opposite direction as happens in Dodecaedron 2007 or you can direct it just like Scrabbles do with their food balls, not by pushing but by rolling. In this way you follow the DOD and direct it not only along straight lines but you can draw segmented patterns avoiding enemies, following the lines on the Scaraball field.<br/><br/>You can score by making a goal (3 points) or by blasting an enemy out of the field (1 point).<br/><br/>The first prototype of Scaraball was presented on January 2007 at IDEAG Italian Designers and Authors Gathering.<br/><br/>See the PhotoReport here -- <a target='_blank' href=\"http://warangel.it/IDG7e.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://warangel.it/IDG7e.html</a><br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://warangel.it/ScaEng.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://warangel.it/ScaEng.html</a> (English)<br/><br/>",

Players begin with one card each, which is placed face up in front of them. On her turn, a player is read an event from a new card; the player must then indicate the position on her own time line where the card should be placed. If she's correct she places the card in her own time line; if not, the next player gets an opportunity to win the card. The first player with ten cards wins.<br/><br/>The cards from this edition may be mixed with the original Chronology game to create even more combinations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As a game, Talecraft aims to promote creative thinking through story creation. As a story-creation tool, Talecraft aims to help writers generate ideas for stories, and help combat Mental Block.<br/><br/>Talecraft provides the different Genres and Archetypes as cards. Since the setting is dependent on the genre of the story, Talecraft leaves the creation of the time and place to the imagination of the player. For the plot, Talecraft uses the Key cards, where a player may either be given plots, or keywords that would govern the story. Players may be required to add more characters to his cards. In this event, the player&rsquo;s story would be more character-driven than plot-driven.<br/><br/>A player of Talecraft has to create a story using the cards he had picked. The limit the picked cards set to a player prompts the use of the player&rsquo;s resourcefulness; and the need to fit all the cards into a story stretches his imagination.<br/><br/>It is not a requirement to appoint a winner when playing Talecraft. Since the aim of the game is to make stories, and the basis of a good story often depends on the judge's personal taste, Talecraft is often played without declaring winners. Should a winner be required, however, here is how it is done:<br/><br/>Each player will have a cup before him. After the player tells his story, all the other players will drop coins in the storyteller&rsquo;s cup, depending on its impact on them. If a player thinks the storyteller&rsquo;s story was not well made (like if there are a lot of loose ends, or if the events of the story are too scattered), the player does not drop any coin into the storyteller&rsquo;s cup. If the player thinks the story is acceptable but has little impact on him, he drops a coin in the cup. If the story manages to amuse the player, he drops two coins. And if the story awes him, he drops three coins. At the end of the game, or rounds of game, the players tally the scores. The player with the most coins wins.<br/><br/>Another way to decide a winner for Talecraft is to appoint a non-player as a judge who would decide who the winner is to be.<br/><br/>",

The player who first completes his/her three rows wins the game.<br/><br/>Game play<br/>Each player gets 48 number tiles (three sets of numbers 1-16) and arranges them in three horizontal rows from 1 to 16. One player is selected as the caller, shuffles his/her tiles and draws them one by one from a bag. He/she calls the number drawn. Each player takes that number from one of his/her horizontal rows. If it is a 1, he/she can start one of his/her three new main rows. If it is any other number, it has to be placed in an auxiliary column first.<br/><br/>Each player may have up to 5 vertical auxiliary columns of any length. There must not be any gaps (i.e. tiles must be placed directly below one another), and tiles must not be rearranged later. Tiles need not be placed in sequence, but they should be placed in a way that allows for efficient removal to construct the main rows. Tiles may only be taken from the auxiliary columns starting at the bottom (not in the middle or top), and main rows can only be started when a 1 has been called.<br/><br/>Each of the three new rows has to be started with a 1. The tiles have to be placed in correct sequence here. A 3 can only be placed after a 2, and so on. Tiles can be taken from the auxiliary columns (without being called again) as soon as the number at the bottom directly follows one at the end of one of the player&rsquo;s main rows. E.g. if there is a 3 at the end of one of the player&rsquo;s main rows and a 4 at one of his/her auxiliary columns, the 4 may be taken and placed next to the 3 in the main row. Tiles can be taken from the bottom of the auxiliary columns as long as they are in matching sequence.<br/><br/>The player who first completes his/her three rows wins the game. If no player is able to complete all three rows by the time the caller calls the last number, the player with the fewest tiles left wins instead.<br/>__________________<br/><br/>One of Ravensburger's Traveller-Series games.<br/><br/>",

Twenty five circular cardboard dustbin-lid counters are placed face down on the moon; on the reverse of each dustbin-lid is a picture of a specific Clanger or other denizen of the moon.  (Clangers lived on the moon and used dustbin lids as doors - just accept it.)<br/><br/>The players (there's no upper limit stated) are dealt out the twenty five cards in the deck, taking turns to turn over a dustbin lid and if the revealed character matches a card in their hand, they take the token.  The player with the most tokens/dustbin lids wins.<br/><br/>An unusual inclusion in this game, however, is the &quot;whistle sound chip&quot; device - a battery-powered gadget that when pressed plays an extract of the extremely distinctive whistle-like 'Clanger speech'.  Whenever a player matches a token and card they get to press the Clanger whistle...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the classic Scrabble word game, players use their seven drawn letter-tiles to form words on the gameboard. Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.  (Description taken from the Scrabble entry).<br/><br/>This Presidential edition of Scrabble is based on the familiar classic but with several interesting twists.  The letters and basic rules remain the same, but there are several important differences.  <br/>    The board is round and not square.  <br/>    All of the extra scoring spaces are replaced with the various states.  They have two effects.  The give the familiar triple letter or triple word scoring bonus.  In addition each states gives an additional bonus equal to the state&rsquo;s Electoral College value (after all other modifications).  So for instance California is a triple letter space and gives a bonus of 55 points as well (it is also way off to one side).<br/>    There is a list of extra &ldquo;words&rdquo; that are worth extra points; either 5, 10 or 15 points.  Some of these &ldquo;words&rdquo; are things like FDR or LBJ which would not ordinarily be available to use, while others are regular words like vote that just give an extra bonus.<br/>    Finally there is a deck of cards showing all of the Presidents.  Each card has a bit of historical information and gives a way to either get an extra bonus when played or change the rules in some fashion.  The Nixon card for instance allows one to play a word with one letter misspelled.  Players receive five of these cards at the start of the game, and can play at most one per turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(From the website)<br/><br/>The first major battle of the Civil war, Bull Run (also known as First Manassas) was a contest of tactical opportunities lost. Featuring a brilliant flanking march by Union forces under General Irvin McDowell that caught the Confederate General Beauregard by surprise on his weak east flank, the Union army failed to roll up the Confederate line due, in great measure, to the famous stand by General Thomas Jackson's Virginia brgade, which was said to have stood &quot;like a stone wall&quot;. On the other side of the tactical ledger, General Beauregard's plan to drive across Bull Run on the west side to Centerville, thus cutting the Union army off from its supplies and communications, failed due to poorly communicated orders. Battle at Bull Run is a simulation of historical events of July 21, 1861 intended to give a feeling for the historical decisions required by the two army commanders in a fast play format.<br/><br/>* Two-Person or Solitaire Play<br/>    * Color Five-Page Game Rules Manual<br/>    * Upgraded Game Map In Full Color<br/>    * Larger Game Map Now 15 x 11 Hexes<br/>    * 25 Upgraded 3/4&quot; Counters<br/>    * Two Union Units Added To Order of Battle<br/>    * Solitaire Play Rules<br/>    * Available in PDF Format<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ABOUT THE GAME<br/><br/>Outside the Box&trade; was designed to be unique in many ways. First of all, the box top or cover actually becomes the game board (we don&rsquo;t think anyone has ever done this before), hence the name Outside the Box. Secondly, it is a team game (there are very few team games out there) where everyone is actively involved throughout the game. This makes it a great party game, but also gives every single player a chance to be a hero by helping his or her team win. Most importantly, Outside the Box is all skill. There are no dice. Teams can only advance by getting the answers right. It&rsquo;s very fast. It&rsquo;s very fun and it&rsquo;s very, very addictive.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/><br/>Outside the Box&trade; consists of four types of rounds: Volley Box, Team Play, To Each His Own, and Speed Round. In most rounds, answers are given, in order, A through Z. Teams begin on the Start square with a Volley Box round. The team that wins the Volley Box moves onto the board to the first Team Play space, receives 3 PassCards, and will play the first Team Play round. As your teams progress through the game, you advance through 3 phases, and the 377 categories become more challenging. To win the game, you leave Phase 3, flip over the Start square (which reveals the Winner's Box), and attempt your Final Challenge.<br/><br/>FOUR ROUNDS OF PLAY<br/><br/>With four different rounds and hundreds of categories, it's like playing four games in one...so it's never the same, as it changes each time you play. Here are some examples:<br/><br/>Team Play - You have been chosen as the Captain of your team for this round. The category is: &quot;Musical Groups and Rock Bands.&quot; The timer is set for 2 minutes, and the pressure is on! You must go, in order, A through Z, and name a group or band that begins with each letter of the alphabet. Your team may help you, but only by giving you &quot;outside the box&quot; clues. Did you just say, &quot;That's easy?&quot; Ready, set, go!<br/><br/>Volley Box - In this round, teams battle back and forth through the alphabet in a verbal hot potato! The category is: &quot;Things you give, share, or offer to others.&quot; The timer is placed away from view and is set for 1 minute. Again, going in order, A through Z, the first team could shout, &quot;Alimony!&quot; The other team might respond with, &quot;Benefit of the doubt!&quot; The first team says, &quot;Condolences!&quot; (or &quot;Cup of sugar!&quot; or &quot;Custody!&quot; or &quot;CPR!&quot; or &quot;Coat!&quot;) The team that is stuck when the timer beeps loses the round. Just how far &quot;outside the box&quot; will you go to help your team win?<br/><br/>To Each His Own - The category is picked and 4 letters are randomly chosen from the alphabet. Both teams are given 2 minutes to secretly write down a response for each letter. Try not to match each other. If you're really good, you may just get the chance to &quot;stump the Master!&quot;<br/><br/>Speed Round - You are the &quot;Actor.&quot; You have picked a Speed Round card and the timer is set. You must go in order through the alphabet and get your team to say exactly what is on that card. Go ahead, jump around, sing, use props -- but you better not say any part of the words on the card, or &quot;it sounds like&quot; or &quot;rhymes with..&quot; The timer is going... what are you waiting for?<br/><br/>CONTENTS<br/><br/>Included are 377 category cards with thousands of possible answers (which makes the game different each time you play). The Master List is a three year compilation of well over 15,000 possible responses in which you could get the chance to stump the &ldquo;Master&rdquo; by coming up with your own &ldquo;outside the box&rdquo; answers. Also included is an audio CD featuring the inventor of the game, Rick Sugarman, explaining the rules. There are also live unscripted role playing examples, as well as helpful hints. In addition, the game comes complete with easy-to-follow, learn-as-you-play instructions and quick reference cards, an electronic digital programmable timer (battery included), team game pawns, scoring chips, letter cards, and PassCards.<br/><br/>",

Wild mayhem spills out and reckless hot potato passing begins!<br/><br/>THE OBJECT:<br/>Move around the Potato Cards by following the directions on the Action Cards. Avoid being stuck with Potato Cards. The person with 5 Potato Cards is out. (Toss potatoes to other players quickly and repeatedly. Remember, the potatoes are smoking hot. Move fast my friends, or you will get burned.)<br/><br/>THE CARDS:<br/>Spud consists of different cards: Action Cards &amp; Potato Cards.<br/><br/>The Potato Cards &ndash; have potatoes. <br/>Laughable characters like &ldquo;Wedge&rdquo;, &ldquo;Tots&rdquo;, &ldquo;Yukon&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Couch.&rdquo; (They are a hoot.)<br/><br/>The Action Cards &ndash; have actions to explain where potatoes should be passed. <br/>&ldquo;Right&rdquo; &ldquo;Left&rdquo; &ldquo;Anyone&rdquo;&hellip; you get the picture. Draw a &ldquo;Spud!&rdquo; card and you get to draw a Potato Card to give to another player.<br/><br/>THE SNAFUS:<br/>The action cards have actions, and they also have colors. Green, orange, blue. A Potato Card can only be moved if the color on the Action Card is the same of that on the Potato Card. If you do not have an action card of the right color to move a Potato Card &ndash; you&rsquo;re stuck with it.<br/><br/>Among the Potato Cards are &ldquo;Rotten Potato,&rdquo; he&rsquo;s one tough character. Draw him and you&rsquo;ve got to keep him. And some deceptively sweet-looking potato cards that count as two potatoes.<br/><br/>Some of the cards create general chaos &ndash; &ldquo;Everybody immediately draw 3 Action Cards&rdquo;, &ldquo;Everyone pass your hand to the left.&rdquo;<br/><br/>ENDING THE GAME: <br/>When you are piled up with 5 potatoes, you are out. Though the fun still continues until only one player is left. The last player standing (or sitting) without 5 potatoes is the winner!<br/><br/>",

To make matters worse, there's only one hat maker in town! Compete with your opponents to stock your shelves with the best selection of hats while sticking them with stock they won't be able to sell.<br/><br/>Madder Than a Hatter is a hybrid of take-that and set collection mechanisms. On your turn, you must place one hat into any player's inventory and take the first hat off of the hat maker's assembly line. Some hats are premium and allow you to manipulate the player's inventories or the hatters assembly line. After all hats have been played, points are scored and a new round begins. Points are scored for having only one hat of a style, or for having a monopoly on a style. Play a number of rounds equal to the number of players, then whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Each player will roll their die and whoever rolls the highest goes first. This will continue clockwise.<br/><br/>From the community deck players find resources to help them along with making their awesome ideas come to life!<br/><br/>To create an idea, each player will need 1 lab coat, 2 schematics, and 2 chemical sets.<br/><br/>In the idea deck are patience testers. Everything from monsters, contraptions, to your favorite TV show!<br/><br/>When coming up with an idea, you never know what you'll get. Idea cards are marked with a + or - on them and can either be played against a player, or on yourself.<br/><br/>When playing a - against a player, this will make their patience go down. Say you come up with a -3 patience card and you play it against someone. Their patience die will go down from 20 to 17.<br/><br/>Also in the deck, are + patience cards. If your patience die is at 17 and you play a +2, you will turn your die back to 19. Players may not go above 20. If a player reaches or goes past 0, the player has lost all patience and is mad.

In a 6x6 square grid, two gardeners move, grow their flowers, and shorten opponent's flowers.<br/><br/>Each turn, you move your gardener to adjacent square, and play a reclamation card.

You win the game when you fulfill the victory condition, or forcing your opponent unable to move or reclaim.<br/><br/>The flower components are hand-made by the designer, formed in clay and baked in an oven.<br/><br/>The first edition was published in May 2016 for the Tokyo Game Market (TGM).

Each character can perform up to 2 unique actions per turn with movement being a repeatable action. Available character actions (dependent on class) include Harvest, Travel, Search, Attack, Shoot, Defend, Cast and Use.<br/><br/>Points are awarded by defeating characters, casting unique spells, discovering treasures, hoarding resources, promoting characters, occupying strategic locations and slaying Monsters!

Players take on the role of a Dwarven Weeaboos and work together to build the perfect waifu (husbando / inhuman abomination).<br/><br/>Players sell cards in their hand for gold, which can be used to buy cards fro their collection. These collectibles can be purchased either from the communal store, or the player's own hand. Cards have unique effects that help build sets or mess with the other players. Players must match sets to build the strongest collection possible. Collect across 5 categories of cards: Card Games / Anime / Culture / Apparel / Internet.<br/><br/>When a set gains a 2nd card, the player gains a waifu part. When a set reaches 3 or more cards the player gets to play a waifu part. Players contribute Waifu parts together and each part changes the way scoring works at the end of the game. Be sure to build wisely! Once the waifu is complete, it will marry the player with the highest scored based on the card that make her/him up.<br/><br/>Cards all have unique art and are filled with references and jokes to nerd culture.

Shuffle the cards and place them face down. Turn over the top card from the deck. Read out the word and explain the meaning to any younger players. .Look for a noun (name or object) &ndash; which you would associate with the word on the card. Use the environment around you for inspiration. Found it?<br/><br/>For example:<br/>&lsquo;Soft&rsquo; &ndash; this can be your favourite toy (Paddington bear), neighbours cat (Spots), your clothes or your mommy&rsquo;s hug.<br/>&lsquo;Smelly&rsquo; &ndash; this can be your brother, broccoli or fish.<br/>Then open the next card and look for something that is matching both these words. Now another card! The game becomes more difficult and fun with each new opened card. Let your imagination and creativity kick in!<br/><br/>Where to play?<br/>Anywhere you like! You don&rsquo;t have to sit at the table to enjoy Quick Eye. You can play at home, in the car, outdoors, on your way to school, when visiting friends or queuing at the shops. Looking for objects with given qualities becomes even more fun if you change the location.<br/>Who is this game for?<br/>For all the family. Quick Eye encourages kids and adults to discover the world and focus the attention on things around you.<br/>When travelling.. With just a deck of cards you can cover a few hundred miles having a lot of fun and keeping your kids busy!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stud poker is any of a number of poker variants in which each player receives a mix of face-down and face-up cards dealt in multiple betting rounds. Stud games are also typically non-positional games, meaning that the player who bets first on each round may change from round to round (it is usually the player whose face-up cards make the best hand for the game being played). The cards dealt face down to each individual player are called hole cards, which gave rise to the common English expression ace in the hole for any hidden advantage.<br/><br/>Cards are dealt in a prearranged combination of face-down and face-up rounds, or streets, with a round of betting following each. This is the next-oldest family; as poker progressed from three to five-card hands, they were often dealt one card at a time, either face-down or face-up, with a betting round between each. The most popular stud variant today, seven-card stud, deals two extra cards to each player (three face-down, four face-up) from which they must make the best possible 5-card hand.<br/><br/>Source: Wikipedia, &quot;[en.wikipedia.org]&quot;, available under the CC-BY-SA License.<br/><br/>",

There is a spring on which you place a cap, with a pointed top facing up. The top is to serve as spindle for the turntable. All 32 chips are divided equally among the players who sit down (or stand) at a certain distance from the turntable. Minimum distance should be 30cm, measured between the clenched fist (arms outstretched)and the centre of the turntable. <br/>The object of the game is, for each player to try to get rid of his stock of chips, as quickly as possible. Players try to do so, when it is their turn, by throwing a least one chip onto the turntable, after which they may give the next player his turn. However, if a player thinks he will be able to get rid of more than one chip during one and the same turn, he may go on throwing chips onto the turntable. But mind this: if, during a player's turn, chips fall of the turntable, his turn is over, and he must add the fallen chips to his stock.<br/>In case a player, when it is his turn, feels it would be too risky to try and throw chips onto the turntable, because he is afraid many chips may then fall off, that player may throw one of his chips and miss, deliberately. In other words: he may try to throw his chip in such a way, that it will bounce off the top side of the turntable. There must have been contact.<br/>The player who first gets rid of all his chips, wins the game. Players may also agree to play several rounds, to have one final winner.<br/><br/>",

There is a dice with 4 operations &amp; 2 any operation symbols.<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll the dice. Using the operation you roll and any two number cards you have, you must capture a number position on the board. Once your cards are played, they are discarded. Pick up an equal amount of cards from the deck. At all times each player must have seven cards with them. Rules for capturing a number position:<br/><br/>You must capture at least one moon to be able to enter that planet.<br/>If you have captured all the moons, nobody else can enter that planet.<br/>You can enter a planet only after all four moons have been captured - either by you or by others. <br/>You need to capture both halves of the planet to win the planet.<br/>Once you win a planet, give the pegs of that planet back to the respective players and take the planet's hexagonal board and keep it with you.<br/><br/>The power cards allow you to either evict another player from the moon or planet position or replace them in that position. If you cannot perform an operation, but have a power card then you must play it. You cannot simply skip your turn. But, if you don&rsquo;t have a power card you still discard a card and pick one up from the deck, you then either use your new card or pass your turn.<br/><br/>The rules of entry, are first, moon then planet and rules of eviction, are first, planet then moon.<br/><br/>The first player to capture two planets or with the highest points, wins the game. If all number positions are captured then there is a &ldquo;stalemate&rdquo;, then points are counted. the points system is:<br/><br/>each moon equals 1 point<br/>each half of a planet equals 2 points<br/>total value of a planet equals 8 points<br/>Player with the highest points wins!<br/> Galaxy Raiders is a game of planning, strategy and negotiation. Challenge your friends and family to see who will emerge victorious in this engaging battle of wits. Enjoy with them as they set forth on a galactic conquest to capture planets and moons using your mathematical prowess. For parents with young kids, it's the perfect way to introduce them to an entire learning multiverse. See them transform into problem-solving geniuses right before your eyes!

Each combination will result in different synergies and tactics, providing a new experience each time you play!<br/><br/>On their turn, players each play 2 cards from their hand to perform actions such as moving, attacking, and triggering special abilities. Each card played this way is added to the team's chakra pool, allowing other players to spend said chakra to trigger more powerful abilities! Playing the right card at the right time is key to defeating the villain and saving the village, so work together as a ninja team to strike when the time is right!<br/><br/>Whether you're a fan of the anime or simply enjoy cooperative games, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations - The Board Game offers something for everyone thanks to its easy-to-understand rules and deep game choices!<br/><br/>",

The cards rank as usual, from 5 (low) to ace (high) in all suits.<br/><br/>The title stems from Latin and means `fifth'. This refers to the fifth player who plays alone, against the rest who play in two teams of two. The objective for all players is to take card points in tricks; the two teams combine their points while the quintus receives a card point bonus and the privilege to choose the trump suit. Jacks, queens and kings earn points while pip cards cost points. Additional points (&quot;premiums&quot;) may be scored by winning combinations of cards in tricks.<br/><br/>As an alternative to a standard hand, the quintus may elect to play a nil hand in which he seeks to avoid taking any court card or ace.<br/><br/>Team mates may signal information about their cards through specific hand gestures.<br/><br/>As a variant to the base game, the quintus may be chosen through a bidding round in which the bid for the highest amount of combined card, nil and premium points wins.<br/><br/>",

Mules &amp; jeeps are needed for movement; stores are used to sustain the expedition. Additional components include the game board, a sales price indicator, money and a deck of 52 cards.<br/><br/>Players start with a sum of money and four cards. On his turn, the player must first pay his expenses either with cash or by expending a store. He then plays one (sometimes two) cards and follows the instructions. An 'Authority to Buy' card permits the purchase of one type of commodity (mules/jeeps/stores); the price of these items starts low but steadily increases with demand. Award cards give the player free commodities or allow cheap purchases from a rival. The most common cards, however, are the Camp cards. These are numbered from one to twelve, and playing an appropriate Camp card and transport item allows advancement within the same or subsequent group of camps on the board. If the player has a jeep, he can advance to two camps that turn provided he has two suitable Camp cards available. Money is earned upon reaching a new camp, and the turn is completed by drawing back up to four cards. By moving onto an already-occupied camp, you become the 'guest' of that player which forces him to pay for your upkeep as well as his own until one of you moves away. The winner is the first person to arrive at camp twelve.<br/><br/>",

The STORM system allows players to GIVE, TAKE, USE, FIGHT, SEARCH and MOVE their way through the dungeon, enriching themselves and trying to avoid traps and battling enemies along the way.<br/><br/>Enter the magical dungeon, find treasure and fight the Gorgon Queen and her minions.<br/><br/>The game box includes six dungeon levels of varying difficulty and is designed for novice or veteran gamers.

Mercenary was designed with the aim of filling two gaps in the field of wargaming.  Firstly, it is a game involving diplomacy and intrigue that can be played by as few as two people, even a solitaire game being possible and, secondly, it is based on an important period of transformation from a medieval to a modern style of fighting, which has previously been neglected.  This game is designed to give the atmosphere of a corrupt, money-grabbing Europe, torn by military strife, when almost everyone's first thoughts were for self-interest: truly a mercenary age.<br/><br/>Mercenary covers the period of European history from the invasion of Italy by Charles VIII of France to the French Wars of Religion in 1560.  The game, therefore, consists of 11 turns each 6 years in length.  The object of the game is for the opposing players (1-5) known from now on as Merchants to try, by bribery, terror or military conquest, to amass the largest amount of money (measured in crowns) by 1560.<br/><br/>Components include 22&quot; by 21&quot; full color mounted mapboard, 220 die cut counters, 11&quot; by 16&quot; diplomacy chart and rules book.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Provopoli, players belong to one of two groups: Blue represents forces that support and defend the current order, while Red stands for groups that critisize the system and actively try to change it.<br/><br/>Each player belongs to one of these two camps, and controls one (or, with low player counts, several) pawns of that color. A random scenario card defines the objective of the game. There are open scenarions where each group knows what's at stake; and hidden scenarios, where only one party knows the objective, but the other group has to stop them.<br/><br/>Depending on the scenario, there are some devices available: Cars that increase movement (but can't enter buildings or parks); barricades that block roads or access to buildings; and explosives that can be used to block spaces or remove barricades. There are also chance cards that either call a random event, or represent an utility that can be kept for later use.<br/><br/>The two groups act in alternating order. Three dice are rolled for movement points that are assigned to pawns (the decision is made as group). On the target space, the pawn may pick up a chance card, collect a device, use a device, seize an opposing pawn, or even free an arrested member of the own group. Depending on the scenario, there might be additional actions available.<br/><br/>Play continues until one of the sides fulfill their objective, or until they are no longer able to reach it.<br/><br/>Example of objectives: Blow up the red head quarter; arrest a number of neutral pawns (or, for the other side, escort them to the train station); escort a state guest to several locations (or make it impossible to reach these locations).<br/><br/>",

You are one of them, a leader of a large group of anthropoids. A mysterious force of evolution makes you grow, multi-play and evolve at surprisingly high speed. For a quick evolution you need a lot of meat so you focus on hunting mammoths. The more mammoths you hunt down, the more quickly your brain grows.<br/>With a bigger brain you can do more things&hellip; You can improve your hunting skills and face your enemies more successfully. The best hunters will achieve the desired goal of evolution, becoming a modern human &ndash; and thus securing immortality of their species. Those less successful, whose development froze at a lower level of evolution, can at least go to have a chat with their relatives in a zoo.<br/><br/>Brief summary of the game, the goal and the end of the game:<br/>The player determines by means of the cards of commands, where his pack should go. Packs go across the landscapes and they try to hunt down as many mammoths as possible (by going across cards with pictures of mammoths on them), so that they have proteins to grow their brains more quickly and to rise on the evolutionary meter. By doing this the skills of the pack will grow and evolutionary advantages can be acquired. The winner of the game is the person who will be the first to complete his evolution by reaching the level of a human homo-sapiens. At this moment the game ends.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, the player rolls the die, flips an animal card in front of her, and hopes it shows the animal on the die; if so, the card stays revealed; if not, the card is flipped face-down again. Roll an animal that's already revealed, and you can flip a card of your choice. Roll the moon, and one of the timing cards is flipped. The game ends when one player finds all five friends or time runs out, in which case no one wins.<br/><br/>How to play Wo Ist Mausi?:<br/><br/>- The six-Mausi cards with the page &quot;Mausi comes home&quot; to the top placed in the middle of the table. <br/>- Each player is dealt five cards with the same animal back color and places them with the back upwards before him. <br/>- Whoever's turn it is throws an animal that needs to turn one of his cards. If it is he animal rolles on the die, the card is exposed. <br/>- If there is a different animal, the card will once again be face down. <br/>-The dice shows the moon is one of the six cards on the side of Mausi, &quot;Mausi sleeps&quot; reversed. <br/>- The dice shows an animal that the player has already found, nothing happens. <br/>- Winner is the person who discovered the first five friends of Mausi on his maps. <br/>-When Erica is sleeping all six cards on the page &quot;Mausi&quot; lie, there is no winner.<br/><br/>",

You are an Elemental Trunk Man, a time-traveling agent, who unblocks treasure boxes collected over time and takes out treasures. With the help of the elemental spirits, we will unlock the seal of the treasure chest and aim to open more treasure chests than our rivals!<br/><br/>We will start from the point where you can communicate with the four spirits of Fire, Water, Wind, and Earth. <br/>In order to open the sealed treasure chest, we communicate with the spirits to gain mana and unseal the treasure chest. You can earn points of contribution by the degree of contribution.<br/><br/>There are two things you can do in your turn! <br/>-Summoning spirits (increases the spirits that can be communicated) <br/>-Unseal the seal of the treasure box (Communicates with the spirits, obtains mana and unseals the seal of the treasure box)<br/><br/>The spirits are wooden tokens of the four elements. On your turn, you shake up your set and throw them. The pieces that land upright can be used to trigger your actions. The more tokens you collect, the better chance of success.<br/><br/>There are some treasure chests where bonus points can be added to the contribution points by releasing the seal quickly, and by removing the final seal. It is important to have the bonus points at the end of the game and the timing of releasing it. However, if you do not summon the spirits, it will become difficult later.<br/><br/>Summoning spirits requires a deck build idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow to combine the spirits. It's fun to think of your own combination. In addition, it may be important to change the combination depending on the situation of the treasure chest.&quot;<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>New sense game of &quot;token build&quot; x &quot;role action&quot; x &quot;placement&quot;!

        "description": "You are The Sandwich Guy, whose food truck is known far and wide as a premier foodie destination. You're given a non-stop barrage of ingredients, which you use to make sandwiches... of variable quality.<br/><br/>Starting with a hand of eight cards, each turn you choose three cards to discard as a &quot;sandwich.&quot; The only rule is that the three must be equally distant from each other (e.g., 2-3-4, or 3-6-9, or 5-5-5, etc.). You then draw a number of cards based on the &quot;quality&quot; of your sandwich: if it all cards discarded were of the same suit, you draw four; if all three were of the same color but two different suits, you draw three (that is, you get back the same amount you discarded); if the cards were of different colors, you only get back two.<br/><br/>The game consists in decisions about when to play certain cards and when to hold on to them, having a good idea of what's left in the deck and what's not, and in keeping your hand size healthy enough to stay in business. If you would draw the last card, you win; if you cannot make a sandwich out of your ingredients, you lose.<br/><br/>The game can be played entirely in-hand, holding the deck of cards with the ingredients on top and the discard pile face-up below.<br/><br/>As part of the Isaludo collection, the rules can be found in this forum thread.<br/><br/>",

Spend your autumns and winters around the Mediterranean, your summers by the Baltic coast and your springs in Central Europe.<br/><br/>Travel by your own railroads or pay the other players to use theirs. Set your ticket prices high to squeeze out profits or low to undercut competitors. If you can't find a cheap train ticket, then you can always go by airplane, in which case you might contribute to global warming. Global warming makes the Southernmost cities unattractive, while new holiday destinations pop up in the far North.<br/><br/>Will you bet on a bright future and invest in ferry lines to the sunny islands of the South? Or will you defy the icy emptiness of the North and then keep prices high to make people fly and tilt the climate in your favor?<br/><br/>Nice Weather is a relatively fast and family-friendly track building game with a foundation of logical thinking paired with prisoner's dilemma-like pricing diplomacy and livened up by random action cards that lets you set hilarious traps. But amidst the easy and fun, the experienced player will inhale a strong breeze of Go as the network struggle scatters among a dozen frontiers that suddenly merge to one final whole, making the player with the most well-oiled micro-macro mental elevator the winner.<br/><br/>Dynamic land prices let you buy up cheap competing lines, allowing for a randomized yet balanced game board; for each game, 6-12 European cities out of 28 are randomly selected, making for up to 36000 different start configurations. Then there is always Essen, and this is where you start the game; in October 2008 to be exact.<br/><br/>",

Deeply cerebral or a medical mystery, such is the unpredictable journey to the land of clowning around!<br/><br/>Each player receives 3 cards: subject + verb + moral. From the beginning, you have a proverb in hand.<br/><br/>The barter phase begins: you can swap one or more cards as many times as you want between players and/or only once with the pile! Thus, your proverb may become &quot;the artist in you + is a slobbering Mmnster + speaks him gently in his ear&quot;<br/><br/>Each player reads their proverb and must reveal their viewpoint  if another player asks &quot;but what you meant by that?&quot;. Luck and your barter strategy, combined with your imagination, will make you defend or justify the indefensible &quot;maxims&quot; to make them... brilliant!<br/><br/>The voting phase closes the round: every player submits  a secret ballot of 1 card of &quot;you're awesome&quot; to the author of the best proverb and 1 card of &quot;let's barter!&quot; to the one who deserves it! If you receive the Awesome card, it's worth 1 point (i.e. 1 blue cube), while a &quot;let's barter&quot; card is just a friendly message that expresses condolences and to try again.<br/><br/>Troquons! is a very simple and addictive game that will make you appear sometimes as a great and gifted philosopher gifted of profound reflexion and decisive for the future of mankind, and sometimes as a schemer trying desperately to justify a proverb that is worth not a cent.<br/><br/>",

It is also what you are in this game.<br/><br/>As the chief of an Edamame clan, you will raise a dragon because you need his vital energy to bring you to live. To do so, you will have to recruit new Edamames to reinforce your clan. You will send them to work to get resources and you will also make your opponent&rsquo;s Edamames work for you. Lastly, you will use your resources to breed your dragon.<br/><br/>A game of Edamame will be timed by the number of dragon cards that will be bought by the players. In a 2 players game, a round is 3 dragon improvements. In a 3 or 4 players game, a round is 4 dragon improvements. At the end of each round, everybody will check for a common intermediary objective. After 3 rounds, the game will be end by an honorship championship in which each clan will fight each other one. So, how does it work ?<br/><br/>",

On each turn, players roll a dice to decide if and how many tiles they have to place on top of the existing stack. To make things a bit more challenging, there are two types of tiles - while they are both round, the standard ones have grooves carved into them that give them some stability. However, there is also a batch of slick tiles which are much harder to put into place.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From BGN:<br/><br/>Alchymia - La Qu&ecirc;te du Cristal Noir (The Quest for the Black Crystal) is a small print (500) game, self-published by Swiss designer Frank Schwab. The game accommodates 2-5 players and plays in roughly 30-60 min (my best guess). Images and rules (in French) are available at the Alchymia website.<br/><br/>Each player is given a personal board and 3 potion cards and 8 atomic element tokens in 5 colors are placed in the central reserve. Each potion card depicts 1-4 atomic elements used to create the 5 Elemental Crystals (Fire, Water, Earth, Air and Time). Players attempt to collect and place the atomic element tokens on their board in such a way as to mimic the current configuration of one of the 5 crystals. They do this, in turn, by playing a potion card to retrieve an atomic element token of one of the types shown on the card from the central reserve and place it on their game board. They can also choose to remove an element token from their game board by playing a potion card with that element type. Alternatively, players can pass their turn by wiping their board clean of tokens.<br/><br/>Once a player has matched a crystal configuration, they wipe their board of tokens, collect the crystal structure card they matched, reveal a new crystal configuration card and begin collecting beads for another type of crystal. The twist is that each type of crystal confers upon its owner an additional special power (for example, the Time Crystal allows you to rearrange your board during your turn, instead of taking or removing an element token). The first person to collect each of the 5 crystals becomes the master alchemist who can create the coveted Black Crystal.<br/><br/>",

The Tyco edition divides the categories among the players and each will act as contestant and quizmaster for each other during the game (although players could agree to play the game show way). The Outset Media version introduces a third format: Categories for the Jeopardy, Double Jeopardy, and Final Jeopardy  rounds are on separate playing cards. The gamemaster can mix and match them as one sees fit.<br/><br/>In all versions of the game, a player chooses a category and a dollar amount. The first to give the correct response in the form of a question is credited with the value of the response. However, the jeopardy is that an incorrect response has the values deducted from one&rsquo;s score. Random Daily Doubles during a round allow one player make a wager based on one&rsquo;s own knowledge. Players may wager any or all of their money on one final response in Final Jeopardy! The player with the most money is the winner.<br/><br/>",

She's lost her dance shoes, teapot, schoolbook, and other valuables, all around the enchanted building. Help her find her prized school supplies, and discover fun lessons from the Good Fairies along the way.&quot;<br/><br/>This is a hide and seek game for 2 players. Princess Sofia (the seeker) tries to find the supplies that the hider is hiding around the academy. The hider draws from a stack consisting of different supplies, some of Sofia's friends, and a wildcard lucky guess card.<br/><br/>If the hider draws one of the supplies, it is hidden by having the seeker cover their eyes or look away from the game play area. The hider then hangs the item behind one of the many windows. The seeker then spins the spinner to determine how many &quot;peeks&quot; behind different windows they will get (1-4 peeks are possible).<br/><br/>If a Sofia friend is drawn, the hider shows the seeker which window the friend is behind, and this encourages the seeker to use their memory so they don't search behind those windows on future turns.<br/><br/>Lastly, if a wildcard/guessing card is drawn, the hider selects one of the supplies and hides it in their hand. The seeker then gets to guess which item is in their hand.<br/><br/>Lots of fun for kids as they hide items and use their memory and luck to find the charms.<br/><br/>",

The game&rsquo;s etymology stems from its primary mechanic, which penalizes players for the creation of 3-in-a-rows with their pieces. The result is a game with devious tactical twists and a hint of coldness.<br/><br/>Black moves first, placing a single stone anywhere on the grid. Players then alternate turns, placing up to two new friendly stones on empty cells. If two stones are placed, then:<br/><br/>a) the placed stones must not be diagonally adjacent to each other, and<br/>b) the placed stones cannot result in the formation of a new horizontal, vertical, or diagonal three-in-a-row comprised of friendly stones.<br/><br/>A crosscut is a 2x2 square in which each player controls a pair of opposite corners; a player's move may never result in the formation of a crosscut.<br/><br/>Black wins if there exists a path of orthogonally or diagonally adjacent black stones reaching between the top and bottom rows, while White wins if there exists an analogous path stretching from the westmost to eastmost columns.<br/><br/>",

Shout out saucy answers to any Statement Cards to win more Nasty Woman cards.<br/><br/>This game includes:<br/>-20 Nasty Woman Cards<br/>-55 fill-in-the-blank Statement Cards<br/>-25 Action Cards (including Girl Gang, Attack of the Mansplainer, and Visionary Cards)<br/>-10 You're Trumped Cards<br/>-Instructions with Nasty Woman Bios and Feminist Field Notes<br/><br/>Celebrate your favorite feminists.<br/><br/>Notes give definitions and context for feminist terms and phrases.<br/><br/>In more detail...<br/>To start the game, each player is dealt one prized Nasty Feminist card, featuring 1 of 20 women who have changed American history, and you&rsquo;ll earn more as you play. And just like in real life, the more amazing women you have on your side, your chances to win are greater. This card keeps you in the game if you get the dreaded&hellip;<br/><br/>You&rsquo;re Trumped card! This is the death card which means you&rsquo;re out, loser! It&rsquo;s really the worst card you can get. Getting trumped is truly, truly terrible. But, you can trade in a Nasty Feminist card to stay in the game.<br/><br/>To earn Nasty Feminist cards you&rsquo;ll need to win Statement cards, which are unfinished statements about politics, celebrities, and current events. Each player will finish the fill-in-the-blank statement with their best improvised verbal answer and the judge (the person who drew the card) will pick their favorite one. The winner gets to keep the statement card. You can trade in 3 of your earned statement cards for a Nasty Feminist card during the game.<br/><br/>The game can end in two ways: the last person standing or the person who has the most Nasty Feminist cards once you&rsquo;ve gone through the entire deck wins.<br/><br/>",

Your powerful Stealth Force has been protecting its portion of Dimension Gemstone for centuries, but the enemy has been looming ever closer; threatening to conquer your territory.<br/><br/>Strategy - You may find that your only protection is your wide array of Stealth Attack Modules and their Concealed Power Pieces as you move through Dimension Gemstone, evading your dangerous opponent. Some of your Power Pieces can be used to destroy, while others can distract and act as decoys. The Starburst, Blaster, Ringer, Decoy and Laser each have special ways of fending off the enemy (see below). As commander of the Stealth Force, you must remember the importance of your mission - defend, retaliate and move with all possible speed. The future of Dimension Gemstone is in your hands.<br/><br/>Under Fire - The longer you wait to retaliate, the more time your opponent has to build strategy and plan the next attack. Keep focused as there are concealed dangers that may catch you unaware.<br/><br/>Escape - Dimension Gemstone has Portals that are the way for you and your Stealth Force to find a route of escape, or as a means of Surprise attack. They can zip you from one side of Dimension Gemstone to another, swiftly out of danger's way.<br/><br/>Your Mission is Clear - and it is of the utmost importance that you keep in mind the dynamics of each Stealth Attack Module. Your victory or defeat may be at stake. As Commander of the Stealth Force, you control the fate of Dimension Gemstone.<br/><br/>Each move is an exciting and strategic challenge to outmaneuver your opponent. Dimension Gemstone needs your protection. Seek to conquer, but be careful not to fall into the hands of the enemy. <br/> Each type of power piece is different. While a BLASTER can destroy all pieces and Portals in a 2-space range, the RINGER has only a 1-space range. The LASER has a 7-space range limit and can destroy the first piece or Portal in a straight line. The STARBURSTS have the power to emanate energy in a starburst pattern and can destroy all pieces and Portals within a 3-space, straight line.<br/><br/>",

The fish start in one location, then travel through a series of paths &mdash; following the arrows as they move &mdash; to reach openings in the reef.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they roll a die, then choose one of the four fish and move it along paths a number of spaces equal to the number rolled. After they finish moving, if they're on a space all by themselves, they can reveal a tile that has only one bubble on it. If they share a space with other fish, they can reveal a tile with as many bubbles as the number of fish on that space. Thus, players need to keep their school from wandering too far apart as they travel through the reef.<br/><br/>If the players manage to reveal all 28 tiles before all four fish have swum out of the reef, then they win!<br/><br/>",

When he will discover who is trying to fool him, he will deliver to him/her a wonderful present: a nice pair of cement shoes that will turn out to be very comfortable during underwater strolls.<br/><br/>One player is the boss, while the others are the remaining members of the &ldquo;famiglia&rdquo;. They try to Pass the Blame to each other, in order to avoid the Boss&rsquo;s fury. In doing so, they also try to protect their Darling, hoping to succeed in escaping with the money.<br/><br/>During their turn the players try to play Excuses Cards that match with Boss&rsquo;s Mood. In order to do so, they have to use their imagination, by inventing stories that both match with the played Excuses Cards and sound credible. Be Careful! Every time that a player succeeds in Pass the Blame, the Suitcases Cards pass from one player to another.<br/><br/>As soon as a player can&rsquo;t invent credible stories anymore, the Boss looses his patience and dispenses his fair Judgement against both the unlucky player and his/her protector. At this point the game ends and the player who owns the Bag with the Cash can slip away with the money. However, if the Bag with the Cash was in the hands of the accused player of in those of his/her protector, the Boss gets the money back and wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>la Borsa con il malloppo &egrave; sparita.

Questi si Scaricano la Colpa l'un l'altro, per evitare la furia del Boss. Nel farlo, cercano anche di proteggere il proprio Prediletto, nella speranza di riuscire a scappare con il malloppo.<br/><br/>Durante il proprio turno i giocatori cercano di utilizzare le Carte Scusa dalla propria mano per riuscire a giocarne una che combaci con l&rsquo;Umore del Boss. Per farlo si &egrave; costretti a lavorare di fantasia, inventado storie che, non solo devono rispettare gli spunti delle Carte Scusa giocate, ma devono anche risultare plausibili. Ma attenzione! Ogni volta che un giocatore riesce a Scaricare la Colpa su di un altro giocatore, le  Carte Borse passano da un giocatore all&rsquo;altro.<br/><br/>Quando un giocatore non &egrave; in pi&ugrave; grado di raccontare scuse credibili, il Boss perde completamente le staffe ed emette la sua Sentenza contro il povero malcapitato e contro il suo protettore. A questo punto la partita finisce e il giocatore che possiede la Sorsa con i Soldi pu&ograve; felicemente svignarsela con il malloppo.

Will the busy parent birds manage to get enough food for all of them?<br/><br/>In Schmatzspatz, four wooden birds sit on the edges of the circular rotating &quot;board in the box&quot;, each with a worm in its beak. In the middle area are twelve hungry little birds with open mouths. A symbol die determines the sector of the board where the most hungry baby birds are. The player now decides which one of these birds to feed and tries to rotate the board to move one of the adult birds to the right position.<br/><br/>The turning board occasionally blocks the feeding, however,so the players must remember these &quot;blocked&quot; positions. When the worm can successfully be fed to the bird, the baby closes its beak. If the players manage to feed all the baby birds before running out of worms, they win the game together.<br/><br/>Schmatzspatz includes a competitive version in which each player tries to get rid of his worm supply first.<br/><br/>",

If they answer correctly they get a token and when they've gathered tokens in every colour, they can head to the capital (center). First they need to get to a corner of the board where they answer a question of their own choosing. Then there are two coloured spaces from the corner to the center. When the players get to the center they answer a question of the other player(s) choosing. A correct answer in the center means victory!<br/><br/>",

It's quick to learn but strategic, learn from your enemy and try to get inside their mind to work out what sequence they will lay their cards down.  Artwork by Adrian Stone.<br/><br/>Recreating the largest airborne invasion in history, Operation Market Garden in World War 2.  Use your battle and tactic cards to out smart your opponent, use your equipment wisely, reveal events and monitor your divisions. Can you win enough battles to secure the vital bridges, will you be able to capture and hold all of them in time?<br/><br/>Each round consists of 7 battles, to win a battle the player must have the highest points score. The player will combine, battle, tactic, equipment and event cards to get to their total score.  Whoever wins the most battles wins the bridge.  The Allied player must win the bridge to proceed to the next bridge a draw is not enough.  Players will take it in turns to be the Allied player to see how many bridges they can capture.  The German player can reduce the effectiveness of the Allied player by altering the Allied Division cards, the Allied player can try and counter this using the Victoria Cross card but these are limited so you must use them wisely.<br/><br/>Events can be positive or negative for both sides.  Players must try and work out what sequence their opponent will lay down their cards.  They must remember what cards have already been used and try and get inside their opponents mind to out think them, what did they do last round, will they do the same thing, which combinations of cards do they favour, when should I use my Victoria Cross card.  There are only 3 equipment and 3 tactic cards for each side so they must be used carefully.  Can you get your opponent to use their most powerful card on your weakest card?<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next player's turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.<br/><br/>",

Either she adds a part to the caterpillar or she takes a petal of the color indicated on the dice. A flower is completed when all of the petals are of the same color or when they are all of different colors. Instead of taking a new petal, a player may also choose to move one from one flower to another.<br/><br/>There is a minimum strategy to use in this game, so it's great for kids who love flowers.

        "description": "A faction of the Japanese military had been looking for an excuse to extend Japanese control deeper into the Chinese mainland. When several Chinese monks were beaten, this faction paid thugs to fan anti-Japanese activities in the Chinese sector of Shanghai. Seizing the &ldquo;opportunity,&rdquo; a small force of naval infantry invaded Chapei, the all-Chinese northern section of the city of Shanghai. But the Japanese had not counted on the quick reaction and effective fighting of the Nationalist Chinese forces from nearby Nanjing. The initial Japanese thrust was thrown back quickly. It took repeated reinforcements over the next five weeks for the Japanese to push the Chinese out of the city and away from the Huangpo and Yangtze Rivers. Shanghai would become a major springboard for further Japanese advances, but the battle had taken its toll. This game covers those five weeks of fighting.<br/><br/>Shanghai Incident uses the Fire &amp; Movement system designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>The Japanese military has greater overall skill and firepower, although the Chinese have two German-trained divisions. Both players have manpower limitations that are eased only when the Japanese player calls a pause to his offensive. Both sides therefore have to weigh time and space against numbers. The player who strikes the best balance will emerge the victor.<br/><br/>Skills:<br/><br/>     Level: Regiment<br/>     Hex: .625 miles (1 km)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Note that all apps required to play this game were discontinued in early 2015.<br/><br/>LEGO: Life of George combines LEGO bricks and iPhone technology into a fast-paced building game.<br/><br/>In the two-to-four player game, each player takes turns building objects with LEGO bricks based on a pattern shown on a player's iPhone or iPod Touch (4th gen and later) [and an Android 2.1+ app was added in summer 2012] via the LEGO: Life of George and LEGO: Build Your Brain apps. When the player finishes building that object, she snaps a picture with the phone, which then presents a score based on how difficult the object was, how quickly the player built it, and whether it was built correctly. After five rounds, the player with the highest score wins. In LEGO: Build Your Brain, players play &quot;game show&quot; style, solving in different categories a variety of pattern building and logic puzzles for points.<br/><br/>In the single-player mode, you're presented with a series of images, and you complete them as quickly as possible in order to record a high score. The &quot;My Life&quot; section of the app allows you to upload pictures of LEGO models that you created for posterity or for future challenges against other players. The separate Build Your Brain app can also be played individually, solving pattern-building logic puzzles (and taking a picture of one's solution when complete) like those that are presented in the multi-player game.<br/><br/>",

There are also To Your Demise cards that rely on a player's wit and luck alone. The Save Yourself cards counteract the various To Your Demise scenarios, but a player needs the correct Save Yourself card to survive, and if they don't have it, they can either barter with other players or gamble with the house deck. If you can't save yourself then you are Critically Hit and reduced to 1 Save Yourself card and your Life Card. After that, if the murderer gets you through the To Your Demise cards - you're toast.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to last the longest against The Murderer.

        "description": "Dai Hasami Shogi is a variant of Hasami Shogi. It is played on a 9x9 grid, traditionally on a shogi board. The word dai mean large and the name is apt because this game uses twice as many pieces as Hasami Shogi, 18 per player placed initially on the two back rows nearest the player controlling those pieces. The two sides are called sente [&quot;black&quot;] and gote [&quot;white&quot;], as in shogi, with sente moving first. Traditionally, Go-stones are used for the pieces.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture all of an opponents' pieces or to have captured more pieces than one's opponent if a situation arises in which additional captures are no longer possible. All pieces move like rooks is chess, i.e., in any uninterrupted vertical or horizontal line in any obstructed direction without jumping. Pieces are taken by custodial capture, i.e., when an enemy piece becomes horizontally or vertically sandwiches between two of a player's own pieces. One of the two pieces bracketing the captured piece must be moved in order to capture but multiple simultaneous captured are allowed.<br/><br/>The game is a member of the petteia or lantruculorum family of games. A similar game is played in Thailand and in , where respectively it is called Mak-yes and Apit-sodok; this game differs only in that the second row of pieces starts on the third rather than the second row.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a simple but challenging game. It is very simple to learn but the strategy can be very deep. The board consists of a 5x5 grid of dimples in which marbles are placed. The game is played somewhat differently than Pylos or Pyraos which form a pyramid on a 4x4 grid.<br/><br/>The &quot;wild&quot; third colored marble is placed first in the center of the 5x5 grid. This overcomes the problem that the pyramid on a 5x5 base requires an odd number of marbles to build.<br/><br/>In Pyramids the goal is to get rid of all of your playing pieces first. If placing a marble completes a square and at least three of the marbles in that square are the player&rsquo;s color, then the player gets to place an additional marble on top of the square. If the additional marble completes another square, then using the same rule as before the player gets to place a third marble on so on.<br/><br/>Since the two players may have overall played a different number of marbles towards the end of the game, the game might be over before the pyramid is finished. The game obviously can&rsquo;t last longer than 27 moves since there is no rule to remove marbles in Pyramids.<br/><br/>",

Players try to move through a labyrinthine game board in order to reach a desired symbol shown on a game board tile that matches a hidden card held by this player. The game board consists of a number of fixed tiles as well as rows and columns in which tiles can slide back and forth; these tiles show tunnels &ndash; T-shaped, straight, and otherwise &ndash; and a player can move his token only along the path as it exists on his turn.<br/><br/>At the start of his turn, however, he takes the one tile on the side of the game board and pushes it into a row or column of his choice, shifting the tunnels and pushing out one tile that the next player will use. This player now moves his pawn, and if he reaches the desired symbol, he reveals the card, then looks at the next card in his stack to see what he wants to reach next turn. Once a player has revealed all of his cards, he needs to return to his starting corner. The first player to do this wins!<br/><br/>To this basic game, The Amazing Spider-Man Labyrinth adds one twist, with the Lizard having a presence on the game board in a variant included with the base game.<br/><br/>Reimplements<br/><br/><br/>    Labyrinth<br/><br/><br/>",

This version has been handed out by Schmidt Spiele for free and has not been meant for sale.<br/><br/>Each player has his own deck of 27 cards with cards 1-9 in three colors and a unique symbol on the back to identify which cards are his. At the start of each round, each player lays out three cards face up in front of him to create his row; places a face-up stack of seven cards, seeing only the top card, next to his row to create his Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.<br/><br/>Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty his Ligretto stack. If he has a 1 on the top of any face-up stack, he plays it to the center of the table. If he has a 2 of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, he can place the 2 on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be following the same color.<br/><br/>If a player can't play anything, he can reveal cards from the stack in his hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. He can play this top card onto a central pile as long as he meets the above rules for doing so.<br/><br/>As soon as a player empties his Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of his cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in his Ligretto stack. The player with the most points wins. Players can alternatively choose to play a certain number of rounds and the player with most points in the end wins.<br/><br/>In the rare case that neither player can play any cards, the round is scored based on the cards played so far.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

That is, if you manage to survive...<br/><br/>About the game:<br/><br/>Escape from Site 19 (EFS19) offers a unique playing experience. Game participants do not compete against each other, but rather work together as team members to beat the game. As survivors of the containment breach at Site 19, the base of the international clandestine organization, the &ldquo;SCP Foundation&rdquo;, each team member must move along the game board to complete his escape. This ultimately leads to an encounter with SCP-0001, the most significant anomaly of them all.<br/><br/>Along the way, the team draws cards featuring the escaped anomalous objects, the SCPs. The cards reveal physical and mental tasks. At first, the tasks are relatively straightforward, but as the game progresses, they become increasingly difficult, requiring trust and teamwork.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, every team member will face challenges and share his stories, making Escape from Site 19 a meaningful and memorable experience.<br/><br/>Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è This game may be difficult to play for squeamish gamers.

        "description": "A magical 350-card trivia game for 1-10 players collecting superstitions, myths, spells, folklore, and more- old and new, from around the world.<br/><br/>The goal of Rabbit Rabbit is to be the first to collect seven cards by answering questions correctly, and play starts with the person whose birthday is closest to the current date.<br/><br/>In clockwise order, players take turns answering question cards pulled from the top of the deck by the person to their right, taking care to keep the answer hidden. If the player answers it correctly, they keep the card. If they don't, it's discarded.<br/><br/>When you win your sixth card and are one card away from winning, you must say &quot;Rabbit Rabbit&quot; out loud. If you forget and another player notices and says it first, skip your next turn, giving everyone else a chance to catch up.<br/><br/>There are multiple ways to play:<br/><br/>Team Play. If you're playing with four or more players, you can optionally split up into teams of equal size.<br/><br/>Host Mode. Playing with three or more, and have an odd number of players? Designate one player as the Trivia Host, who opts out of answering cards, and instead has card reading duties.<br/><br/>Scored Play. If you'd like a faster pace, the host can open up each question card to all players, and everyone who answers correctly each round gets a point. The first to reach seven points wins.<br/><br/>Solo Play. Playing by yourself? Read the cards, challenge yourself to answer them correctly, and see if you're right.<br/><br/>Important Note: Superstitions, like all folklore, can vary wildly and change over time, with multiple variations even in the same small region. If you find a superstition in Rabbit Rabbit described differently than one that you grew up with and hold close to your heart, you're strongly encouraged to share your version with everyone.

        "description": "Three Sticks is a board game that takes geometry to the next level. Players are challenged to think creatively and use only three types of sticks to create geometric shapes. In each turn, players add two sticks to the board and earn points for the shapes created. With compelling game mechanics and exciting surprises, Three Sticks is a promising entertainer for both kids and adults.<br/><br/>Players begin with six sticks, chosen randomly using reload cards. The three types of sticks, purple, orange and red, are 3, 4 and 5 units long respectively and can be placed along the blue dots marked on the board. While all three sticks can be placed horizontally or vertically, red stick can also be placed diagonally.<br/><br/>Each player places two sticks in their turn, with each stick's tip touching the tip of at least one other stick on the board. If a geometric shape is created in the process, the player earns points. Points are awarded as per three parameters :<br/>1. Perimeter of the shape <br/>2. Bonus as per the type of the shape <br/>3. Points in blue circles, if the shape surrounds any such circles on the board.<br/><br/>Once all six sticks are used, a player may collect six more by picking a reload card. Additionally, five power cards are distributed to each player at the beginning of the game. These cards provide special powers to the players that can improve their position in the game or slow down the progress of other players. The cards may be used in any turn up to a maximum of two per turn.<br/><br/>The first player to reach a score of 500 wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The triangular fields of the board are molded so that a corner of a die exactly fits in. The die can be moved from space to space with a simple nudge at the top.<br/><br/>Object of the game is to get your 4 dice across the board.<br/><br/>PREPARATION FOR THE GAME WITH TWO ? The younger player chooses a color and puts his 4 dice into four edge spaces of his side of the board.<br/><br/>WHAT DOES A TURN CONSIST OF?<br/><br/>1.) Each turn must be executed completely. One might not skip a part of the turn. You may not move a die less than its actual movement unless you reach the finish without completing your die roll  <br/>2.)   Dice may not touch. So a die will block 3 spaces. (2 spaces if on an edge.)<br/>3.)   If a player has no legal move, he skips his turn.<br/><br/>GAME RULES FOR THREE PLAYERS All rules of the normal game for two persons are valid also for the game with three. <br/>Additionally you must follow these rules: 1.) Set up is different . See rules for proper 3 person set up.<br/><br/>The third and fourth dice of each player may only be moved, when the first and second dice have reached the finish.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The perfect crime! This boxed game allows players to plan and try to solve it. No dice or other elements of chance.<br/><br/>One player (a referee) plots and writes the basics of a crime set in Victorian London. The other players (detectives) have little to work with at the start other than a description of what occurred, plus some information on the main characters. From that point on, it becomes a race against the clock since each crime must be solved within a set number of turns known only to the referee.<br/><br/>The mechanics are simple: detectives submit questions in writing to the referee. After collecting all of them, the referee answers them verbally. This means that the answers usually are understood only by the asking players. Questions must be very specific: for example, a player can check bank records only if he or she has spent part of a turn going to the bank. A mixed group of players will always have one or two ahead of the pack and one or two behind. Players also may pool information, but some always will hold back.<br/><br/>Elementary Watson is simple to play, difficult to master because it requires role-playing thinking. Players can choose areas of expertise, which might help them gain additional clues. A game board of London with neighborhoods and landmarks is included, but Elementary Watson can be played with paper and pencil.<br/><br/>",

On the second round, swap again but draw 6 more tiles.  Words must now be 5+ letters.  Repeat for a third round (six-letter words), drawing six tiles again, so there are six words scored total in a game.

The game takes its name from a German town; various photographs of the community there are printed on the cards.<br/><br/>The cards are dealt to the players, giving them each 10 cards in hand.  They then pass two cards to their player on the left.  One of them (the starting player) plays a card on the table.  The following players must put down a card of the same color; otherwise, they play a card of another color.  The winning card is the one with the highest value and of the same color as the first card played.  The winning card's owner collects the entire set and gets to be the starting player for the next round.  However, the owner of the card with the lowest value and of the same color as the winning card takes the highest value card in the set.  The game then continues with the next round of passing, playing, and scoring the cards.<br/><br/>The game ends when all cards have been played and collected.  The players total up the values of the cards they have taken, and whoever has the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

But they've been dead - excuse me, sold old - for a long time. But now, Fette Kuhe 2 is being released!<br/><br/>It's been nine years since a pair of farmers sat down at their favourite table in the local bar and started arguing about who had the fattest cows in the village - naturally, each claimed that honour for himself. In order to finally have peace in the bar again, the bartender made the following suggestion:<br/><br/>Pick a meadow and then have each farmer send a cow-herder along with 4 similar cows there. After no more than 18 days, the decision would be reached as to which farmer had the fattest cows - that farmer would be rewarded with a feast.<br/><br/>Nowadays, the argument has become a tradition and so the player take on the roles of the cow-herders that lead their cows to eat on the meadow. And also bring them lightning-quick into safety, making sure that they don't get sick in the windy and rainy weather. It's logical that the cows will eat as many grass tiles as they can get, since that's the only way that they'll get really fat.<br/><br/>",

To complicate matters, local drilling is causing the ice to crack and shift unpredictably. The path that you take to get to your buddies may not be there on your way home.

A plastic basket containing a coiled 'snake' is placed in the center of the players.  The 'snake' consists of a large, material-covered spring with a plastic head on one end.  The basket has a number of holes, one of which will activate the latch on the basket and release the snake.<br/><br/>Players select a colored Swami &amp; place it in position at the base of the basket closest to them.  During the game, players are not permitted to move their hands away from their Swami unless it is their turn or their name is called during play.<br/><br/>Players start the game with 5 snake tokens each.  A turn consists of paying a token into the 'snake pit', calling out an opponent's name and pressing a hole in the basket.<br/><br/>If nothing happens, the player can elect to continue their turn for as long as they want, rotating the basket, pressing successive holes &amp; calling out an opponent's name each time, paying a snake token into the snake pit before each press.  Whenever a player manages to get rid of all their snake tokens, they take a ruby from the 'treasure trove' and a fresh set of 5 snake tokens from the snake pit.  A player may end their turn at any time without having released the snake.<br/><br/>If the snake is released, the relevant opponent must catch the snake or they are penalized - they must return one ruby to the treasure trove or take 5 snake tokens from the snake pit if they have no rubies.<br/><br/>If the snake is successfully caught, the caller must give the opponent one of their own rubies.  If no ruby is owned, the opponent gives the caller all the snake tokens they currently hold and - since they now have no more snake tokens - they take a ruby from the 'treasure trove' and a fresh set of 5 snake tokens from the snake pit.<br/><br/>Any player who erroneously attempts to catch the snake or otherwise removes their hands from their Swami at an unauthorized time during play is penalized.  They receive a snake token from each of their opponents.<br/><br/>The first player with 5 rubies is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The boldest of these are that the price to purchase a property landed on is doubled, and that a property may not be mortgaged but can instead be sold back to the bank for its &quot;mortgage value.&quot;  The game is changed immensely - it is no longer advisable (or even possible) for a player to buy outright every property landed on, and properties frequently go up for public or private auction.<br/><br/>In effect, this variant forces the players to make more difficult decisions, reducing the game's luck factor in favor of more emphasis on bidding and negotiation.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Monopoly<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Triumvirat consists of a triangular board with 28 molds and 18 spheric marbles in three colors of three sizes. In the beginning the marbles of each color are situated like this: One large in the corner, two medium sized in the two molds in front of it and three small ones in the three molds before them.<br/><br/>At every turn the player moves one marble, just to the next mold or jumping over other marbles, also combining a number of jumps in one move, if possible. The marbles jumped over may be taken away. Similar to Halma until here, the main difference is that the marbles can only capture marbles the same size or smaller. Because of the very limited space the game is fast and allows no false move.<br/><br/>Played with two players the marbles of the third color just stay at the starting position and will not be moved. The space is even more limited now ...<br/><br/>The first player with only one marble left, loses. The winner is the one with the most points left on the board: The big marble counts 3, the medium sized 2 and a small one 1 point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Wikipedia:<br/>Capablanca Chess is a chess variant played on a 10x8 board. The game is named after its inventor, the former world chess champion, Jos&eacute; Ra&uacute;l Capablanca.  Capablanca thought that chess would be played out in a few decades, that games between chess grandmasters would always end in a draw. This danger of &quot;draw death&quot; was a main motivation for him to create a more complex and rich version of chess.<br/><br/>Besides the usual set of chess pieces, each player has additionally two new pieces with corresponding pawns:<br/>Chancellor: a chancellor combines the moves of a Rook or a Knight; Archbishop: an archbishop combines moves of a Bishop and a Knight.<br/><br/>The new pieces have properties that enrich the game. For example, the archbishop can checkmate a bare king by itself (king in a corner, archbishop placed diagonally with one square in between). Capablanca thought that adding these two powerful pieces would reduce the likelihood of a draw and make the game itself more interesting.<br/><br/>You can play Capablanca Chess online on Jocly website:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.jocly.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.jocly.com/</a><br/><br/>Other Sister Chess variants are: <br/>Bird's Chess, Seirawan Chess, Musketeer Chess, Carrera Chess, Gothic Chess, Janus Chess<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.musketeerchess.net/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.musketeerchess.net/</a><br/><br/>",

They play these cards in turn, refilling their hand as they play. Each card adds to the total sum. The player who plays a card that makes the sum exceed 12 (Cirno can't count to more than twelve) loses and gets a loss point. The game ends when someone has three loss points.<br/><br/>Apart from the numbered cards, there are the &quot;divide by 2&quot; card, the &quot;multiply by 2&quot; card, and then there are the special cards &quot;Turn&quot; (reverse play order), &quot;Pass&quot; (play passes to the next player), &quot;Shot&quot; (choose a player, it's now his turn) and &quot;Double&quot; (next player has to play two cards). The special cards you draw when you lose a round can also be used as special cards. Also, the card with a 9 in a circle makes the total a nine - always. Whenever a 9 is involved, Cirno will full of self-confidence reply &quot;nine&quot;.<br/><br/>This game is based on the flash animation &quot;Cirno's Perfect Math Classroom&quot; in which the character Cirno tries to learn math by adding and subtracting. The flash animation is in turn based on an internet meme regarding one of the boss characters from the video game &quot;Embodiment of Scarlet Devil&quot;, a home made shooting game for Windows. A note in the manual caused the fan base to declare Cirno being a total dimwit, closely associated with the number 9, mostly depicted in a circle.<br/><br/>Translated box back:<br/>Cirno's Math Game ~ let's study with your friends<br/>is a game where Cirno studies math (mostly addition) with her friends because she one day thought that<br/>I'm not stupid! I know! Math is clever!<br/><br/>The rules are simple. Each turn, play a card, draw a card. The card's number is added to the sum total, and the player who plays a card which causes the total to exceed Cirno's comprehension span (12), is out. The lesson is redone many times, and the most competent player becomes THE PERFECT CIRNO.<br/><br/>When you are out, you get a &quot;friend&quot; card. The friend cards can be used to change hands, make Cirno be able to count to 20 and so on. Perhaps they can help you turn the tables?<br/><br/>With simple rules and a quick tempo, this is a card game with the power enough to improve your brain somewhat, playable for all people, from those already married to Cirno, to those who barely know what project Shrine Maiden is.<br/><br/>For 2-6 players<br/>Playtime: 5-15 minutes<br/>Recommended age: Older than a fairy<br/><br/>",

Each role grants the player different abilities.

        "description": "Broadway is a tableau laying game for four players (two partnerships, with partners sitting opposite) using a double-six set of dominos.  The goal of the game is to have the most points, points are scored each turn where a player lays a tile that matches more than one individual tile segment already on the tableau.<br/><br/>A game is played over a series of seven hands, with each hand&rsquo;s tableau building upon a double. The first hand starts with the double six, and successive hands continue on down to double blank.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each hand, thoroughly shuffle the tiles face-down. Each player then draws seven tiles. The player having the double corresponding to the current hand leads it face-up to the center of the table, oriented horizontally from his point of view. Thereafter, each player, in turn, places one tile from his hand onto the table, face-up and oriented horizontally from his point of view, such that at least one segment of the played tile matches at least one tile segment that is already part of the tableau. The tableau usually takes on an irregular, blob-like shape and need not remain closepacked; unusual shapes and enclosed empty spaces of any size are both acceptable. Not all segments need to match, but the more that do, the more points the play is worth. One matched segment (the most common play) scores nothing. Two matched segments score one point for the partnership that played it. Three matched segments score five points. Four or more matched segments score ten points. Points are recorded as they are made during play.<br/><br/>(from the rules found on pagat.com)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Omen is a game of strategy, luck, and magic!<br/><br/>Harness the power of the elements to cast spells that enhance your abilities and hinder your opponents in a race around the kingdom.<br/><br/>Become the most powerful sorcerer by creating elemental Gems, but be careful; draw an Omen card and your luck will flip on its head!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY: <br/>In Omen, players embody 1 of 4 elements and strive to become the most powerful sorcerer. Each turn, players roll the dice and move across the board. If players land on an element space, they collect the corresponding Elemental card and place a Totem, which gives them ownership of that space. The more Totems a player has in play, the more chance they have of collecting Elemental Cards from opponents who land on their spaces, and the more cards they get passing their Castle (home base). These Elemental cards are in turn used to cast devious spells on opponents, or help the player in different ways. Elemental cards are also used to create Gems. The first player to collect 7 of each Elemental card they don't represent and use those to create 3 Gems is the winner.<br/><br/>&quot;Omen is the brainchild of Benjamin Conner, an avid board-gamer who works in the Visual Effects Industry. Having never made a board game before, Benjamin sought out copies of all the most popular games and dissected each one to find out what made it tick, and more importantly what made it fun. Omen is the fantastical game that resulted out of those years of research. Simple and elegant yet full of strategy, Omen is sure to please the whole family and keep you yearning for more.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Most importantly, annoy your opponents by making them face walkouts, parcel bombs and sick passengers.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a train card, ten passenger pieces placed on it, and a random, secret objective such as &quot;have no passengers left to win&quot; or &quot;have 20+ passengers to win&quot;. The game ends as soon as someone achieves their objective. Everyone is then dealt a hand of four action cards.  These cards can do things like add or subtract passengers from any train, switch passengers between trains, switch objectives or trains with an opponent, or oblige everyone to return some passengers to the platform.  Players take turns to play action cards until a secret objective is achieved.<br/><br/>",

Each letter has an assigned number of points, and each word places scores points. Additionally, if one closes the right surrounding a numbered field, one collects as many points as the number signifies. The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

In turns, players attempt to play a card by matching its color or number to the topmost card on the discard pile. If unable to play, players draw cards from the draw pile until they are able to place a card. Wild and special cards spice things up a bit. Additionally, when playing their penultimate card from their hand, players must shout 'UNO' or face a forfeit of drawing two further cards.<br/><br/>WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: Altimeter Alert Card. When played, the player of the altimeter alert card chooses one color and each player puts 1 card of that color, face down, in front of them. Then each player reveals their card and whoever has the highest number wins. If 2 players have the same card, the number is invalid and the next one who has the highest number wins.<br/>Whoever wins then plays his card and the game continues.<br/><br/>",

This game was designed by a priest working in a Zen temple in Tokyo, Japan to promote the work of the temple and the experience for visitors.<br/><br/>Goshuin is originally a stamp given as a seal of submitting hand-written copied sutras to temples. Presently, Goshuin is a popular souvenir among people visiting temples.<br/><br/>In this game, the players visit temples and offer copied sutras to collect Goshuin. You may choose to form connection with many Bodhisattva deities or deepen the connection with certain deities. The player who manages to achieve the highest score through such connection wins the game!<br/><br/>Goshuin Collection is a bidding and hand management game for 3 to 4 players.<br/>The box with words written in Indian ink contains components, such as Goshuin cards, Sutra chips, and Goshuin Notebook boards. 29 Goshuin cards and the Sutra chips are in a Buddhist monk&rsquo;s own handwriting. The original Goshuin Notebook boards were made to order by Aribundou, a long-established bookbinder which has been in business since the Meiji period.<br/><br/>After drawing a Goshuin card from the draw pile, players offer their sutras.

Players control groups of 3 to 12 figures, controlling Heroes, Villains, Sidekicks, Henchmen, and many supporting characters. A game lasts typically 1 to 2 hours, and can be linked to other sessions in a campaign.<br/><br/>Each turn the players roll to determine who has Initiative.<br/><br/>Next, the characters that are still locked in Melee from the previous turn get to fight a round of combat or attempt to withdraw from the fight.<br/><br/>Then the main part of the turn begins. Players alternate activating Units. Models in an activating Unit check their cohesion. Models may be In Touch with one another or Out Of Touch. Models roll to determine if they will receive a Full or Partial Activation &ndash; models In Touch having a better chance to activate fully.<br/><br/>Models in the active Unit resolve their Full and/or Partial Activation. They may walk, run, attack with ranged or melee weapons, get ready to fire, or take a defensive stance. Special Points can be spent to purchase special Benefits.<br/><br/>When a fight occurs, the attacking Model rolls a number of dice equal to the Impact value of their weapon. The number to meet or exceed to score a Hit is based on the character&rsquo;s Ability. For each Hit inflicted, the target gets a Save roll based on their Protection value. Each unsaved Hit results in a Suppression or a Wound.<br/>Suppressions impair the target; Wounds get the character closer to be removed from the game.<br/><br/>After all Models in a Unit have resolved their Active and/or Partial Activations, another Unit activates. Activations continue this way until all Units have acted. At that point tokens that do not apply anymore are removed from the play area, and a new turn is started.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A seven-turn game based on Russia&rsquo;s invasion of East Prussia from August 17&ndash;18 through August 29&ndash;30. The Russian player wins by eliminating three German corps or by having three corps in the western end of the Western box (i.e., west of the Vistula River) and at least one corps in the other four boxes of the area-movement map. The German player&rsquo;s victory requires eliminating three Russian corps and preventing any Russian units from being in the western half of the Western box.<br/><br/>The five movement boxes are overlaid on a map of East Prussia and a portion of the Russian Empire. Each is divided into two parts, distinguished by brown in one half and yellow in the other. Opposing units may occupy the same box without being in the same area, in which case combat is not mandatory unless the German side plays the German Reckless Advance marker. When battle occurs in the Broken Terrain of the two southern boxes each side rolls a die to limit the number of enemy corps that can participate and might further mess with an opponent by playing a Confusion marker. Other Combat and Random<br/><br/>Event markers include Air Recon, Cautious Advance/Pursuit, Cavalry Raid, etc. Restrictions and opportunities also arise based on individual game turns and what happened historically on the days those turns represent. A sidebar describes the historical events. (The game won an award in the Educational Board Game category at the 2019 Serious Play Conference.)<br/><br/>Designed to be a solitaire game published in a magazine, the stand-alone version comes with two-player rules as well. Players have to supply their own six-sided dice.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

But if it's a new course on every stroke, you know the psychics must be hitting the link again.<br/><br/>Players first take turns to draw cards and place them building the course (until the hole card is placed). Each player starts with his token (ball) on a solid green square of the starting card.<br/><br/>Players will then take turns making shots (shown on the top of each card). To make a shot, choose any of the four face up options and move the ball as shown in the diagram. You may not choose the same option twice in a row. Sand and slope squares affect your shot. If the shoot includes an action, for example modifying the course, perform it as stated.<br/><br/>The first player to end a shot with the ball exactly in the hole wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>The Blue &amp; Gray classics are being updated with a slight change in scale to 352 yards per hex, an updated game system that treats unit differences more accurately, and a combat system that includes step losses.<br/><br/>In June 1862, as Federal troops attempted to retreat after withdrawing from Gaine's Mill, Virginia, Gen. Robert E. Lee saw an opportunity to annihilate them on the congested roads between White Oak Swamp and the small community of Glendale. Lee's army included most of the notable Confederate luminaries, such as &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, &quot;Old Pete&quot; Longstreet, A. P. Hill and others, collectively fielding 45,000 men. The Federals, numbering about 40,000, had become disjointed as they attempted to reach and cross the James River. At the same time, though, the Confederate approach became uncoordinated and irregular. The mass of the battle eventually pivoted north of Nelson's Farm, known to the locals by its former owner's name, Frayser.<br/><br/>Frayser's Farm utilizes the all-new Musket &amp; Saber Combat System, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of warfare during the American Civil War. The combat system is intuitive, including all of the details that characterized battle during the Civil War while also simulating the unique aspects of 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, and reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure the line of retreat.<br/><br/>In Frayser's Farm a new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of the rifled musket. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle, and supply lines require players to protect their logistical trains. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.<br/><br/>",

When the Bastiano army attempted to destroy the guerrillas, the Bastiano army was all but destroyed itself. With all the newly acquired weapons, the guerrillas launched a final offensive that ended in the only major battle of the war at the town of Santa Clara. The defeat of the Bastiano western forces caused the rest of the army to begin deserting. When Batista fled in January 1959, the guerrillas triumphantly declared the island was finally free. The improbable victory of the Guerrillas resulted in the only communist country in the Western Hemisphere.<br/><br/>The Cuban Revolution uses area movement and a simple and easy-to-learn combat system. Learning the game takes minutes and about 1-2 hours of playing time at most.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the obscure 1968-69 game show, an MC is chosen and shuffles a deck of twenty cards. The cards are inserted face-down into a numbered vinyl sheet. Players choose three numbers from the vinyl sheet and the cards are revealed. If a pair shows, the player must take all three cards. If not, the player may refuse the cards and they are turned face down and placed back onto the numbered sheet. After all cards are drawn, the hands are evaluated and the players given cash for pairs, three of a kind, four of a kind, and for highest hand in the round. The player with the most money after three rounds plays the Jackpot Game and can earn additional money. The player with the most money after the Jackpot Game wins.<br/><br/>Three versions were apparently released: the original (&quot;Version I&quot;) has no Wild Cards and a red Jackpot spinner; the box has black copyright lettering, and the adult male wears a brown shirt. Some early copies of the release with Wild Cards (&quot;Version II&quot;) feature the same red Jackpot spinner and box design as Version I, but include the updated rules for using the Wild Card decks. Later Wild Card editions (&quot;Version III&quot;) have the updated rules and a black Jackpot spinner, plus the box has pink copyright lettering and the adult male wears a red shirt.<br/><br/>The game was given away as a consolation prize on the show. On the one circulating episode, late in the show's run (#209 of 260, taped 4/22/69), host Art James holds up the box with the brown-shirt male. This strongly suggests that Versions II and III each had a short print run.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "...all the drama of F1 racing, pit stops, punctures, engine blow-ups restarts etc&hellip; (From the back of the box)<br/><br/>Each player gets 2 cars, and they're pretty good: 5.5x3 cm, wheels that turn, not all cloned from one mold. It's a move-by-dice game with the die modified by cards you must pick up whenever you overtake an opponent on a bend. Mods include extra/lost spaces/turns, enforced/canceled pit stops, retirement, or (many) no changes. Some of those mods are whole positions rather than spaces - it must start getting a bit random and skill-less. The lap is 39 spaces long and the track is only 1 space wide with only 2 cars allowed per space so there's going to be lots of blocking: however it is obviously a 'ladder' game and not one where skill predominates over other factors to any great extent. One of the cards takes out the car you're overtaking as well as yours! A couple force a race restart.... You can forgo part of your move by declining to overtake in some situations, to avoid picking up a card. A few spaces on the straights have optional card pickup as well.<br/>Shame there's not a big skill factor, because those cars are really nice.<br/> (From a Micro-Review by David Budd)<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://people.man.ac.uk/~zlsiida/text_files/mrbg-rev.html#cpgpc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://people.man.ac.uk/~zlsiida/text_files/mrbg-rev.html#cp...</a><br/><br/>",

Shapes and colors are guessed independently on each side of the board.  The total number of guesses each player requires to solve the color/shape pattern is tallied, the winner being the one to take the fewest guesses.  The patterns consist of three elements, each having one of five shapes and one of five colors.  A deck of 25 cards is used to establish the pattern, and after each card is used in a puzzle, it is not used again.  The corresponding shape/color is also covered on a grid in the center of the board so the players can use this information in future rounds.<br/><br/>",

It can be described simply as a cross between Scrabble and Dominoes but with words.<br/><br/>The game contains 140 cards with 560 English words. Each card has four family-friendly words (one per edge) and a point value between 1 and 5. 1-point cards have words with the most connections (some with over 30), while 5-point cards have words with fewer connections. But don't worry, as well over 12,000 connections are known to be available!<br/><br/>There are a half a dozen ways to play the game.<br/><br/>Players compete to get the highest score by connecting related words. For example, TEACHER can be connected with STUDENT, SCHOOL, RESPECT, LEARNING, JOB as well as a dozen other words.<br/><br/>Hilarious dialog begins when someone attempts a dubious connection and has to &ldquo;sell&rdquo; it to the group. This makes it a game about connecting people.<br/><br/>Other ways to play include Match, Memory, Grid, Airplane Mode, Secret Connections and Team Secrets.<br/><br/>This family and party game is for use at home and school as well as corporate office team building.<br/><br/>SideLinks is the next version of the Connections card game, renamed for worldwide distribution as we only had the Canadian trademark for &quot;Connections&quot;. It's a new standalone game with more cards, larger cards, some new rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This period is known as the Klondike gold rush, and an estimated 100,000 people were prospecting gold during that time. The gold rush was over almost as quickly as it came, but the people that live there believe that the river still contains plenty of the shiny ore.<br/><br/>In Yukon, you want to be the smartest prospector and collect the most of that valuable gold. But be aware, others also vie for that ore you laid eyes on, the quickest and most vigilant fortune hunter will win.<br/><br/>The playing area consists of a 7x7 card grid. The starting player may decide to take a card from the row or the column that the gold digger is standing in. This card is placed in front of the player, and the gold digger is moved to the spot the card occupied previously. This ends the player's turn. The next players may always take a card moving in a perpendicular direction from the previous movement. The gold digger always moves to the newly freed spot.<br/><br/>The game contains the townsfolk expansion that includes 30 extra cards (10 characters, 3 of each) and 9 gold nugget tokens.<br/><br/>",

The Italian units, particularly the Savoia Grenadiers, fought so well the Commonwealth forces had to conduct three assaults to break their position. Indeed, the Savoia Grenadiers were never dislodged from their hilltop position, and were only compelled to surrender after being surrounded an after the other Italian positions had fallen. In spite of their ultimate defeat, it&rsquo;s regarded as one of the Italian Army&rsquo;s most impressive showings during the entire war.<br/><br/>Keren includes one counter sheet (228 counters) and one map of the Keren area of Eritrea (each hex represents about 220 yards), portraying the Dongolaas Gorge and the heights on both sides, dominating the area south of Keren. The system&rsquo;s unique feature is the ability of infantry units to self-reduce to dispatch men as supply-runners, as was necessary for both sides historically. Fighting atop the difficult hills will give players a sense of why the Italians were so difficult to dislodge, as well as the importance of artillery and air support, and the limitation on the usefulness of tanks.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters<br/><br/>Magazine: World at War #25<br/><br/>",

The beans they tossed out the window grew a stalk that climbed to the sky, and Jack soon climbed that beanstalk to find out what might be found among the clouds (and to escape further punishment from his lame close-minded parents).<br/><br/>In the card game Jack and the Beanstalk, players collectively build three beanstalks that will reach for the sky. At the start of the game, three differently-colored root cards showing five potential stalks are placed on the table and each player receives three cards in hand. Each card has a value, with difficult-to-play cards having a higher value.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must play one card to extend the beanstalk of the proper color, if possible; the stalks on the card being played must line up with at least one existing stalk. Whether the player can play a card or not, she ends her turn by drawing a card.<br/><br/>The card deck includes stalk cards with icons that give the player a special action &ndash; forcing the next player to skip his turn or use a particular color, taking an extra turn, swapping cards with opponents, and landing a golden hen on top of the stalk which prohibits its further growth. The deck also includes one axe card that can be used to cut a stalk back to its roots, removing all growth from the game.<br/><br/>The game ends either when all players pass in turn (being unable to play and the deck being empty) or when the 16th card is played on any stalk. In both cases, the player with the lowest sum of cards in hand wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(From the rule book)<br/><br/>On the Seven Seas is a set of wargames rules covering the high adventure and low morals of the world of the pirate.<br/><br/>From Drake and his sea-rovers to Blackbeard, the Barbary Corsairs and the Wo-k'ou of the Far East, pirates have haunted seas across the globe, preying on port and vessel alike. Now you too can recreate the exploits of pirate captains or the naval commanders that hunted them.<br/><br/>Whether you want skirmish between crews on uncharted islands and in the alleyways of Caribbean ports or ship-to-ship duels that culminate in bloodthirsty boarding actions, the rules offer a quick-to-learn basic game. These small forces of buccaneers, commanded by captains and kept in line by trusted lieutenants, can also be sealed up with ease for larger engagements.<br/><br/>Gameplay centers on two driving motivations that epitomize the pirate life - Fear and Greed. Cunning captains will have to balance these two elements, instilling fear in their opponents with bloodthirsty reputations, while keeping their own crews in line with the promise of loot and wealth<br/><br/>",

That part of the game is pretty much the same as the classic game, Pit.  Players trade cards unseen, in any combinations (unlike Pit) and all that must happen is that an equal number of cards must be given and taken.<br/><br/>When the timer runs out, move your pawn forward the number of spaces equal to the number of matching cards in your hand.  At that point, most of the time, you will be sitting on a different image, so another round of trading is necessary to redistribute your hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Played as the classic Checkers except there are only 7 pieces per player (dinosaurs).  There are two variations on game rules depending on age of the players allowing movement forward and backwards with or without kinging first.  The winner is the first to capture all the opponents pieces or force the opponent in a situation where they cannot move a piece.  The pawns are cute stegosaurus and apatosaurus, the kings tyrannosaurs.  The board has been drawn to look like stone pillars in a sea of lava, and there even are colorful volcano piece-holders.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A colorful game board of the world&rsquo;s continents illustrating castles, sunken ships, lost cities, strange creatures, famous jewels and storied treasures.<br/><br/>Players choose a colorful token and travel various pathways collecting the treasures on the game board.  The game is designed for easy set up with a playing time of about thirty minutes.  Information regarding the world&rsquo;s treasures will pique the interest of all playing. The game is straight forward in play with each participant trying to acquire as many treasures as they can as quickly as possible.  Wealth is accumulated by seizing treasure tokens, retaining situation cards of value, and collecting treasure notes.  For those who enjoy a quick search of facts, an informative twenty-page booklet listing historical finds of treasure has been provided.<br/><br/>Treasure Trove was created to provide an opportunity for parents and grandparents to sit down together with older children and enjoy a board game that is not too time consuming.  The game was designed to invite the interest of all ages targeting 7-12 year old.  The theme of treasure was chosen because it fascinates people of all ages.  The game has unique colorful player tokens, and the multiple treasures allow each player to collect their share in the process of playing the game.  An element of strategy is evident, but there is enough chance and luck to prevent that from dominating the game.  The beginning player has just as much chance of winning as one who has played often.<br/><br/>The game board is designed to be colorful and imaginative. Any quest for treasure entails adventure.  Illustrations of strange animals, castles, lost cities, sunken ships, and temples add to the experience of traveling the world in search of treasure.<br/><br/>There are 72 situation cards that keep the game entertaining. Historical facts, tales of wealth and hidden truths about treasure are revealed in the cards.  Some contain as much value as the treasure pieces, while others cause the loss of a turn or opportunity to move to another location on the board, adding to the element of chance.  Some of the cards are witty to keep the game light-hearted.<br/><br/>",

Each racer will compete on a track of twelve spaces.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt with five &quot;racer&quot; tokens, one for each kind of racer. Among them, the player secretly chooses two and discards the rest. All the discarded tokens form a central pool which will be used for moving the racer.<br/><br/>Each player, turn by turn, takes three tokens out of the pool and place those tokens on one of the three spots on the board: &quot;Move 1,&quot; &quot;Move 2,&quot; and &quot;Move 4.&quot; For instance, a player took two Mummy tokens and one Vampire token from the pool, and places a Mummy token on the &quot;Move 2&quot; spot and the remainder on the &quot;Move 4&quot; spot.<br/><br/>After all the players have taken three tokens out of the pool and placed them on the board, the racer whose tokens wins the untied majority in each spot will move accordingly. For example, if there are 2 Vampire tokens, 1 Nine-Tailed Fox token, 3 Mummy tokens, and 3 Zombie tokens on the &quot;Move 1&quot; spot, only the Vampire will move 1 space.<br/><br/>After a round, all used tokens are taken back to the pool and the next round proceeds in the same manner. The game ends when a racer passes the finish line. Whoever bet for the first racer is awarded 3 points, second, 2 points, and the third, 1 point. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.<br/><br/>Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.<br/><br/>Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.<br/><br/>",

Put on your poker face and watch your friends try to uncover the details. Did you do it as a teen? Was it worth it? The stories they imagine are just as outrageous as the truth!&quot; Semi-cooperative and conversational gameplay allows players to share their experiences and speculate about the other players. &quot;Meme-worthy situations like 'while drunk,' 'and I'd do it again,' and 'in bed' turn even the most innocuous cards into hilarious moments.&quot;<br/><br/>Work together to play a Situation Tile on the It Player&rsquo;s Experience Card. If the combination is true, the It Player answers YEAH and you all score. Keep playing Situation Tiles to score more points, but be sure to stop before the It Player answers NOPE, or they&rsquo;ll score instead! Once the agreed upon number of rounds has been played, the game is over and the player with the most points wins. If there is a tie, the player who told the best story wins.<br/><br/>Certain cards may be excluded for younger players (e.g. some are marked 21+).<br/><br/>",

Landing on a colored square will require players to answer 1, 2 or 3 questions from a given category (blue - easy, green - moderate, red - difficult). The questions are concerned with providing a definition of a given word - if this can be done without any assistance 10 points are awarded - if however the player elects to be given three options from the card only 5 points are awarded for a correct answer.<br/><br/>Points gained are recorded on a notepad with players being able to progress from one educational institution to the next having earned the requisite number of points:<br/>50 to leave primary School<br/>100 to leave High School<br/>200 to leave College.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the finish with more than 300 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tennmac is a card-driven tennis game with a gameboard showing the tennis court. Each player is playing with 4 cards (action- cards) and when he plays a card he immediately draws a new card. The game board is divided into segments from A1 to E3 on each side of the net. The cards (total 96) refer to that segments (to where the ball is played) and the opponent has to be with his 'player' (figure) in an adjacent segment to hit the ball. During play, the figure is able to move 1 segment before the action card is played. Some cards are marked as 'stop-ball' or 'Net-roller', that means, the player has to reach the named segment to be able to hit the ball. <br/>Tennmac is a strategic tennis simulation.<br/><br/>",

Help our intrepid heroes smash, bash and crash through minotaur heads, kappa shells, and the male gaze in their quest to be the first Glamazon decked out in gear that not only looks fab but provides real monster fighting protection.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the first to collect a full set of properly protective armor to cover your paperdoll character mat. Crafted from the corpses of iconic monsters you've killed, each piece of armor in the game is unique and thematically tied to the creature it's made from. These pieces of armor are represented by reusable vinyl stickers with which you get to play dress up! But each dead monster has only enough raw materials to make a single piece of armor, and you'll have to figure out who gets credit for the kill &mdash; you or your &quot;Best Friend&quot;.<br/><br/>Gameplay features a boiled-down bluffing system that puts the focus squarely on social interaction. The tension of trying to catch your Best Friend in a stone cold lie while you stare across the table looking for the slightest betraying twitch is the heart that beats strong within this game. You have no one to blame but yourself if you get stuck picking out glitter wedgies while the winner gets to go adventure in fabulous-yet-practical Glamazon style!<br/><br/>",

When all players have finished, one player rolls the villain, obstacle and setting dice and uses them to create a sticky situation for their character. The other players then must use their characters' abilities and teamwork to create a story in which they rescue their friend. The captured character can make their job more difficult by rolling more obstacles and villains into the story!<br/><br/>Heroes &amp; Villains<br/>One player rolls the hero die to create a character, then rolls the tool die three times and the vehicle die once to create their character's arsenal. The other player does the same, using the villain dice instead of the hero. The villain begins the story by using their character and arsenal to turn the situation against the hero. The hero then continues the story by trying to beat the villain. Players continue taking turns. The game is over when one player can't image how they could possibly win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the Port of Dutch Harbor, the gateway to King Crab fishing in Alaska. Every year, hundreds of crews gather in this small port to take advantage of the very short fishing season in their attempts to get rich overnight. But beware, the Bering Sea comes with great threats, challenging even the fittest. You will face freezing temperatures, waves the size of a ten stories block, heavy lifting, and drastic weather changes in a matter of hours.<br/><br/>In Perfect Storm: Alaska, 2-5 players take the role of small entrepreneurs looking to make their fortune fishing in the Bering Sea. You will start small, with a basic ship and a rookie crew led by a captain with big dreams but little experience. At first, your crew will venture into shallow waters after the easiest prey, the fish. With the money you earn, you will afford a better crew, maybe even a bigger boat and you'll be able to catch shrimp or even the most valuable King Crab &ndash; but you must hurry and use your resources wisely, the fishing season is short and the weather changes in no time.<br/><br/>Every turn, each player will command his crew, using his 3-5 actions to move to a new untouched area or to fish. Depending on the crew experience and the depth of the water, your crew will catch fish (the least valuable), shrimp or crab (the most valuable).<br/><br/>The weather cards dictate the wind speed, which will increase the waves. With a small boat you will have to face the storm in shallow waters, but with a bigger boat and an experienced crew you'll be able to defy the waves and venture into the eye of the storm to catch a larger quantity of King Crab. But beware, every time the wave size is greater that your ship's stability, you will roll the danger die and see whether you ship capsizes.<br/><br/>Perfect Storm: Alaska is a game of risk management and every player will have to calculate his decision to fish for the most valuable prey without exposing his crew and cargo to unnecessary danger. In the end, the winner will be the player who will find the best balance between his boat, crew and captain, the place to fish and the risk to face bad weather.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cheeky Monkeys is a card game where ape trainers have to manage dangerous monkeys. Players take turns getting a monkey and drawing one action card. <br/>The game gets more and more intense with each monkey you take because every ape has a peculiar effect and can interact with others creating various combinations. <br/>The game goes on until you manage to blow other players up with some deadly monkey combinations or blast yourself in the intent. The last surviving ape-trainer is the winner. The action deck is made up of cards that let you avoid exploding or create troubles to your play-mates.  You need to play the right action card at the right time and use all your creativity and (basic) science knowledge to win this highly-strategic Monkey-enthusiastic game.<br/><br/>",

The game combines simple and strategic gameplay with a fun design full of references to popular games and films from the 90s and 2000s.<br/><br/>Players use Honor cards to &quot;pimp&quot; their dad, dressing him in armor and presenting him with various kinds of artifacts that refer to popular games, films and comics. And opponents' dads can be thrown with negative discouraging cards. Reaction cards allow you to fend off opponents or strengthen your actions, and Freak cards are the most powerful arguments in the fight against other players. For each set they collect, players receive Honorable Points and new powerful cards.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player can play from 1 to 2 cards. Before playing an Honor card, the player must say loudly and clearly: &quot;And my / your daddy ...&quot; - and then the text from the card. Otherwise, the card will not work and will be discarded.<br/><br/>English version of title: And my daddy has chainsaw hands....<br/><br/>Play continues until &quot;The End&quot; card is reached and points are totaled.

Beneath the tower are three rubber headed drums that the player positions to maximize scoring. Once the drums are placed, the player releases the balls from the tower. They land on the first drum, bounce up and over to the next drum, and then on to the third drum. Finally they land in a scoring tray that is slotted to show different point scores. Some slots have holes in the back that drain the balls down a track and back into the tower. When all the balls have come to rest the player adds up his score and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The game is a modification of the game Alquerque which was brought to the New World by the Spaniards. Boards for the game were found cut into the flat stone roofs of the Zuni houses, which were used as terraces.<br/><br/>The game is played on a special board of three parallel horizontal lines intersected by a number of left and right leaning diagonals across the width of the board. At each end a line curves around joining each corner point to a point at the end of the middle line.<br/><br/>Each player uses 23 pebbles or pottery fragments as pieces. The object is to capture all of the opponent's pieces. Captures are made by jumping, and more than one piece can be captured at a time. Capturing is compulsory.<br/><br/>This game is similar to Alquerque, and Awithlaknannai, though the latter uses fewer spaces on the board.<br/><br/>",

Still other spaces just allow you to &quot;hang out&quot; or go get a snack.<br/>If a player makes it around the whole board with at least one key and a Driver's License they choose one of six Car Cards and try to match the color of one of their keys.

The game is played on a board with 81 boxes on each side of the net, grouped in 9 sections. When you play a shot, you call the section (1-9) that you are aiming at, and then roll 2 D6 to see which box in that area it lands in (1, 12 = fault, 2-11 - numbered sectors). If the box is next to a line, 2D6 are rolled to see if the ball is called out. Players can only play a shot if they can move to the ball to play it. The number of boxes that you can move depends on the type of shot played by your opponent (volley, power shot, lob), and where on the court you are. You also can move some boxes after your shot to set for the next one.<br/><br/>The rules do not specify what length of game, etc., to play. Presumably you would decide to play a set, or a tiebreak, or whatever, and use tennis scoring to decide who won.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The goal of the game is to be the Diplomat that creates the Greatest World Empire by controlling strategic location cards, collecting Colony and Independent Country Flag cards, capturing soldiers, battleships and bombers.<br/><br/>The map consists of a circle of spaces with flags representing various countries of the world, across the center of the circle is the Bridge of Flags representing the six great colonizing countries.  At the beginning of the game players pick one of the six great countries as their home country.  They get one Diplomat, 10 consulates, 5 soldiers, 1 bomber and 1 battleship.  The battleship and bomber are placed on the home country flag and all the diplomats are placed on &quot;Start&quot;.<br/><br/>The mechanic of the game consists of movement around the path of flags via the roll of dice (doubles get a second roll). When a player lands on a colony he places a soldier, a second landing on the same colony gains a consulate and the Country Flag card.  Landing on an independent country gains an immediate colony.  Soldiers can be captured if another player lands on a colony before a consulate is placed.  Players can move across the Bridge of Flags if they land on one of the two Neutral Countries, doing so gains the player a battleship or bomber.  The battleship or bomber can be used to gain a strategic location flag if he owned when he lands on a strategic location. Normally players can only move clockwise but control of a strategic location allows the player to move either direction when he lands on one.  Additional game play is added via card play introduced by landing on an &quot;Isolation&quot; spot.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has placed 10 consulates.  Flags, and captured tokens are worth points and the player with the most points at the end wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Despite the name of the game being Flip Six, no player is guaranteed to flip six cards while playing. Instead that's only one of the ways for the round to end.<br/><br/>In more detail, at the start of each round each player is dealt six cards and places them in two rows of three cards without looking at the cards. On a player's first turn, he first flips two cards face-up &ndash; one on the top row, the other on the bottom &ndash; then takes his turn, drawing the top card of either the discard pile or the deck. The player then either:<br/><br/><br/>     Replaces one of the cards in his array with the newly drawn card, placing the new card face-up and placing the replaced card on the discard pile.<br/>     Discards the card he drew.<br/>     Places the card on a matching face-up card in his array, then discards both of these cards, then the card either above or below this position.<br/><br/><br/>The goal of Flip Six is to have the lowest total when the round ends, and the round ends when a player has six face-up cards, a player has no cards (due to discarding) or a player calls for the end of the round because she thinks she has the lowest score; in all cases, each other player takes one final turn.<br/><br/>Players then tally their scores, which can be negative due to the deck including negative numbers. If the player who ended the round doesn't have the lowest score, that player's score for the round is doubled. The player with the lowest score after ten rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was designed for the 24-Hour Game Design Contest - June 2012.<br/><br/>A Thousand Years of Blood is a solitaire game where the player takes on the role of a superhuman in an alternate-universe future. After Hitler's assassination in 1944, a superhuman named Heinrich Kirchner took power over Nazi Germany. Under his reign, the Nazis took over the world. As a virtual immortal, Heinrich began a thousand-year Reich.<br/><br/>You are a Nazi experiment with superhuman abilities of your own. And you plan to end Heinrich's rule and put a stop to his thousand-year plans.<br/><br/>The game requires a simple PocketMod, a pencil, a d6, and a d8.  The player selects two of seven unique abilities, then uses the dice to randomly generate the maps of the three levels.  Actual gameplay in the first two levels in completely non-random, as the player seeks to move from the Start point of the map to the End point while taking as little damage as possible from the various enemies.  If you end your turn in an enemy's line of sight, you take damage, so watch out!  The third level is less about sneaking and more about combat, so there is more randomization--Heinrich teleports to different points on the map while activating Laser Turrets and blasting you with lightning.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction: Invasion of the Saucer People is a card game for 2-4 players working together to fend off a 1950's-style alien invasion. Each turn, a wave of saucers attacks, and the players must band together to defend against them. To fail is to lose one of the inner planets&mdash;Mercury, Venus, Earth, or Mars&mdash;to the invaders. Lose them all, and humankind faces extinction.<br/><br/>Fortunately, your crew cards provide special abilities that can be used in a pinch to help hold off overwhelming attacks. Also, the game is self-leveling, so that 2 players face a lesser threat than 3 players or 4 do. Each game lasts 30 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Game Play: (1) Each player is dealt one random Captain card, Navigator card, and Engineer card. These cards each have a special ability usable once per game to help against overwhelming odds. (2) Half the play deck is dealt to the players as defense cards; the other half becomes a draw pile of offense cards for the Saucer People. (3) Each round, three Saucer People cards are turned up to attack. (The actual attack value is calculated differently for 2, 3, or 4 players.) (4) In defense, the players each lay one card from their hand and add them. (5) If the total defense equals or exceeds the attack, the Saucer People are defeated at the asteroid belt. (6) If not, the Saucer People cards now attack individual worlds--indicated by the card suits. And each player's card defends the world of its suit. (7) If the total value of Saucer People cards at a world exceed the total value of defender cards at the world, the world falls to the invaders.<br/><br/>Victory Conditions: Game play continues until the deck is depleted, then victory conditions are calculated, ranging from Total Human Victory, to one or more worlds lost, to Total Human Extinction.<br/><br/>Expansion: There's now an official booster pack for the game. The Invasion of the Saucer People! Booster Pack adds new options to your defense of the inner planets. Included in this pack are full crews for both Luna and Ceres, in addition to Dr. Sato from the Pluto research station, a Captain from Hollywood, a young psychic Captain, a Robot Sidekick, and the ever-popular Space Monkey. Also included are color-coded rocket ships from each world, and new rules for rescuing planets the saucer people have captured!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Preppin is a 2-4 player card game for ages 8+. The goal of the game is simple, keep your family alive and be the lone survivors of the cataclysmic disasters.<br/><br/>Each player is the head of a household trying to survive an onslaught of disasters. Every round you must decide how many of your family members will go out searching for supplies, and how many will stay sheltered. Family members who are sheltered, are safe from disasters. Those that go out, might not come back. Next you draw 1 card from any area pile of your choice for each unsheltered family member and place them into your hand. After you've drawn your cards, you take care of your upkeep by discarding 1 food card and 1 water card. If you can't, then you lose a family member to starvation or dehydration.<br/><br/>Once each player has taken a turn, the last player chooses a disaster card from the disaster deck of their choice. The red ones are the worst.  The disasters effect everyone at the same time. In order to survive the effects, you need to use the surplus cards you've collected in your hand. For example: The Oil Crisis Disaster card is drawn. It takes 1 shelter and 1 food away from everyone, or else you lose 1 family member. In my hand I have 2 Waters, 1 Food, a Generator and a Gas Mask. I will discard my food and generator to survive the disaster.<br/><br/>After everyone has dealt with the disaster, the next round begins starting with the player to the left of the person who just drew the disaster. The game ends when there is only one player left, crowning them the most prepared.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Magical Restaurant is a quick-playing game in which players are small restaurant owners, trying to cater to the varying tastes of idols from the nearby production office and capture their hearts. There are some eccentrics among the customers, so players have to carefully balance upgrading their restaurant furniture and food skills with feeding the passing customers.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to collect the most love points by the end of the game. In order to gain love points you will need to have your customers eat as much of your food as possible. And to do that you need to improve your food preparation skills and get good furniture for your restaurant.<br/><br/>Players start the game with one food stand (which lets you prepare one food card) and five food cards. Five food cards are placed face-up in a row in the middle of the table, and six character cards are also placed face-up.<br/><br/>As the first action in the game, each player chooses two of their food cards in secret. These are then revealed to show which food preparation skills they start with.<br/><br/>Taking turns round the table. players may take two actions of the four available. They may take the same action twice. The options are:<br/><br/><br/>     Take a food card - take one of five face-up food cards on the table, or the face-down card from the top of the deck.<br/>     Prepare food - Take one food card from your hand and place it on an empty food stand. You must have the skill required to play the food card.<br/>     Buy furniture - discard any two food cards to buy the furniture you want. This could be more food stands, or wallpaper/floor tiles that may give you bonus points at the end of the game.<br/>     Raise your skill level - Play a food card in front of you to raise your skill level.<br/><br/><br/>When you prepare food, you need to check whether the hunger level of any of the face-up character cards has been satisfied by the food you have prepared. If it has, you take the character card and place it face-down in front of you. This is where most of your love points will come from.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, replace any food or character cards that were taken from the table, shuffling the food discard pile if necessary. If you now hold more than three food cards, discard down to three.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck of food cards has been depleted twice in a 3-player game or three times in a 4-player game. Play continues until each player has had the same number of turns. Love points are awarded for the character cards you have collected, from drink cards that you may have played during food preparation, and bonuses from the wallpaper/floor tile furniture cards. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Die Logik-Piraten, as the title suggests, combines pirates and logic puzzles &mdash; more specifically, pattern puzzles in which players need to figure out the item missing in a sequence.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he looks at one of the puzzle cards &mdash; brown for easier puzzles, blue for harder &mdash; and chooses one of the four sequences on the card. He says what object fits into the sequence, then uses the pirate ship on the edge of the box to shoot marbles into the trays on one edge of the playing area. If he lands a marble in the tray below the correct missing item, as verified by the answer on the back of the card, he gets to draw a treasure tile. He can then stop or continue to draw treasure tiles &mdash; but if he draws a treasure of the same color as one he already drew that turn, he must return all of them to the play area and gain nothing that turn.<br/><br/>Once all the treasure tiles have been claimed, players compare stacks of tiles to see who wins. Die Logik-Piraten includes two sea monster figures, and players can choose to add one or both to the playing area to make it more difficult for pirates to shoot their cannonballs.<br/><br/>",

Another crew of pirates has landed on the island where you were stranded by your mutinous ex-crew. This new crew of pirates are here to bury their treasure; leaving their boat unmanned just off the coast. You could try to man the ship yourself but with no gold to spend, what's the point? Capture the treasure before it's buried and make it to the ship to sail the high seas with your newly claimed booty.<br/><br/>In this game of exploration, players will use various resources coupled with dice rolling to battle the pirates and animals they will encounter as they move throughout the island. If players can manage their inventory and time, they might be able to get off the island alive.<br/><br/>",

Six new starter decks Animals, Crops, Elementals, Energy, Land and Technology will be available, and players can construct personalized decks of no less than 60 cards, with the cards from any deck.<br/><br/>Ultimate Odyssey is not collectible or random. Players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.<br/><br/>The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.<br/><br/>Lively and Spry contains the Animals, Crops, and Land starter decks, as well as 3 limited edition promo cards.<br/><br/>",

Who can do it first?<br/><br/>A entertaining quick game with coasters.

Then all running fields are placed one after the other in any order (from the start field) as a continuous course, always edge to edge. Finally, the target field is placed to the last running field. The number tokens are mixed loosely and placed open on the running fields as desired (with the yellow side open), so that exactly 1 number token is left each running field.<br/><br/>The player rolls the dice and can move his figure forward (towards the target) as the shown number of the next coaster is rolled. <br/>After a player has reached a new coaster, he always has the choice to continue (again up to 2 rolls to get to the next coaster) or secure himself on the current coaster. Then the number token will be turned to the red backside and the player must finish his turn immediately. A secured number token is saved forever and applies in the rest of the game for all participating players!<br/><br/>Object of the game: To reach the target field in front of all other players.

        "description": "In Prism, the object of the game is to try to collect cards representing the six colors of the rainbow. The first player to collect all six wins the round, and is awarded bonus points.<br/><br/>In the deck, there are cards that represent red, orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. Players can only have one of each color in their collection. In addition, there are action cards that allow you to steal colors from other players. Some of these take cards allow you to continue your turn, taking as many color cards as you can, but with a downside- the more cards you play in a turn, the fewer cards you have left in your hand, limiting your options in future turns. Since bonus points are awarded to the winner for the number of cards in their hand, using play again cards also reduces your potential bonus score.<br/><br/>There are a limited number of blocking cards that you can use to prevent an opponent from stealing one of your colors.<br/><br/>There are a number of other cards, such as a the Prism Wild Card, zap cards to permanently destroy an opponent's color card, and cards that allow you to replenish your hand with additional draws from the deck on your turn.<br/><br/>Prism is ideal for Ages 8 and up. The game is normally played in multiple rounds until one player scores a certain number of points, but each round is enjoyable as a game by itself.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Tricky Wildlife, each of the players is a wildlife manager who's trying to keep many different animal species in his wildlife park, while also preserving the food chain of predators and prey and helping endangered species.<br/><br/>The food chain of animals has top predators who eat the lower predators, who in turn eat the next species down the &quot;animal pyramid&quot;, who in turn eats the lowest prey &ndash; for example: Sharks eat Penguins, Penguins eat Fish, Fish eat Shrimp. Missing a prey animal means that the higher animal type starves, which gives you penalty points as a wildlife manager. Thus, you want to maintain all species in your wildlife park, especially the rarest species as they give you prestige points.<br/><br/>In each of the eight game years (i.e., rounds), you can add 1 or 2 animal groups to your park; each group first consists of 1-4 animals of one species. When you attract them to your park, these are young animals. They can grow old and die naturally after five years, but to do this they need enough prey to feed on during their lifetime. Otherwise they starve. At the same time, higher predators in the food chain can eat these animals.<br/><br/>An animal's age is shown by its location on your lifetime track, which uses four sticks to divide the track into five sections (i.e., years). After each year, you shift your rightmost stick to the leftmost side, which ages all of your animals by one year.<br/><br/>When you don't have all four different species, you gain one penalty point per missing species (and higher level animals may starve). If you have the most (or second-most) of an animal which was rare before, you score 1-2 prestige points. After year eight, you add the number of your animal groups to your prestige point total to calculate your final score.<br/><br/>The challenge in Tricky Wildlife is to balance your desire for prestige points with the need to preserve your complete food chain.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Important information/hints.<br/><br/>Having seen a clear difference in ratings between people who have had the game displayed to them and people who have not. We have put together a little information that might help giving players a better experience with the game. <br/>Hopefully, this will help improving the enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>The most essential part of the game is the Space Shop. It must be used or the game will become boring and you are left with a feel of just chasing one another without any tactical considerations. The Space Shop adds strategic/tactical depth to the game.<br/><br/>The game is about making tough decisions figuring out when it will pay off to sell cards and thus earning credits for purchases. When and where you place field equipment is of the utmost importance. Failing at placing your field equipment the right place can cost you the game. Like in chess you must carefully consider your next moves and in accordance to your plan, buy and place field equipment. Credits are not easy to come by, so be sure not to buy field equipment without having carefully planned out a strategy on how to use the field equipment. <br/>Do not expect to keep a favorite weapon throughout the whole game (although it is possible). At a certain point you may have to give it up<br/><br/>Here are a few hints:<br/>Gravitational Enforcers are among other things used for preventing a melee-heavy agents from catching up to you.<br/><br/>Space Tunnels are used to travel vast distances and thus ensuring that enemy agents will not get too far away from you. Keeping them within your reach.<br/> Sentries are very useful to the agents as they give you more fire power. Placed correctly you can cut off fleeing agents or blow down walls  that enemy agents may use as a defensive barrier trying to buy a little time. But placing sentries randomly is just a waste of credits/cards.<br/><br/>Melee weapons. If you are not a really experienced player, you should not only go for strength and melee weapons. As a beginner you should go for precision and intellect and later in the game , you could attempt using the melee weapons as a support weapon.<br/><br/>The game. <br/>IPA - The Agents is a tactical strategy game that takes place in a near future. You take on the roll as one of the agents of &quot;the agency&quot;, who fight other agents in an attempt to find rare objects to his/her employer.<br/><br/>Among many other things the game includes 200 playing cards of which 145 are distinctly different.  These cards are both used as items for in-game fights and they are also used as the currency of the game. The currency can be spend on buying equipment that is placed physically on the gameboard or for buying temporary boosts for your agent.  All cards are valuable in one way or another and you must wisely choose how to use them. This gives an economic aspect to the game as the number of cards at your disposal is limited. <br/> There are small roleplaying elements in the game that make sure that you cannot use an especially powerful  card early in the game. This mechanic is made to reduce the agony of an unbalanced game.  <br/>To strengthen the replay value of the game, the obstacles (walls) of the game are placed on the gameboard before the game starts. This is incorporated into the beginning of the game as a strategic element which ensures that the gameboard looks different every time you play.<br/><br/>There are alternative rules that among other things varies the luck factor of the game. Gamers have different needs when it comes to the luck factor. Now they have the opportunity to adjust the luck factor so it meets with their needs.<br/><br/>We have experimented with a new kind of artform. Every picture is a uniquely hand painted painting made by a Danish artist.<br/><br/>There are many tutorials on our website and we try to make tutorials on request from our fans, if we find a need for it.<br/><br/>The game may look complex, but most players get into the mechanics/dynamics quickly. When we attended the boardgame fair at Essen 2013, we saw that most players had understood and gotten into the mechanics after only 5-6 turns into the game.<br/><br/>We are in the Beta phase of a new game mode called &quot;Vampiric Elite&quot;, which &quot;kills&quot; the player-elimination&quot; part of the game. All players stay in the game until it ends, thus dealing with &quot;Player Elimination&quot; that some people do not like. Instead the winner is found by a unique point system that awards being a good, but somewhat aggressive, tactician. You must be able to deal the most damage possible while staying aloof of enemy attacks. The whole point system is monitored by the agents' life.<br/>In this game mode it is possible for up to 8 players to participate.<br/><br/>Don't miss out on a tactical treat.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Synopsis:<br/>DICE WARS is a fast paced, dice rolling game where two players try to gather the most cards through rolling dice and placing them on the card to control the cards. Players can roll as fast as possible to create roll combinations and control cards faster then their opponents. Once a card is controlled it can always be taken away from the opponent. Once a player controls four cards the game is over.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>7 cards are laid out in a row. each player takes their dice pool card and places it in front of them. Each player gets four d6 dice &quot;white for player 1 and black for player 2&quot;. There is an extra die color red that can be gathered as cards are controlled and used to help create dice combination to control cards. This die will change ownership often. The players will roll their dice and place them on the cards they want to control. Once you roll the required dice combo you can control the card and turn it 90 degrees. Each card owned is worth victory points [1,1,3,3,5,5,10] at the end when four cards are controlled you add up your victory points and the high score wins. Tactics come in when you have to decide which cards you can control and earn enough points to win. You only need 1 point greater than your opponent to win and once you get your fourth card you need to make sure your points are higher than your opponent. Control changes a lot in this game and since each player is rolling their dice fast you have to keep an eye on which cards your opponent is placing dice on to try and control them. When a card is controlled a player can roll a small dice combination to turn the card back 90 degrees and remove your control but they don't control the card either until they roll the required combination.<br/><br/>",

Your objective is to avoid being captured by guards and escape prison by leading at least 4 inmates to freedom before the shift changes and time runs out.<br/><br/>Each round consists of 2 phases, the first is the Guards Move, then the Inmates Move. During the Inmates Move, your goal is to move at least 4 of your Inmates across the board from their cell at the bottom to one of the 6 exits at the top without being caught by either Guard. Inmates are moved by rolling 6 dice, and spending each die to move an Inmate to an adjacent square with a matching number.<br/><br/>During the Guards Move, 1 die is rolled for each guard and the guard moves along their marked patrol path to the next square with the same number. If a Guard crosses or enters a square that an Inmate has previously passed through, they leave their patrol path and begin following the path left by the Inmate. If the Guard catches up to the Inmate before they are able to escape, they are captured.<br/><br/>The game ends when: 1) 4 inmates successfully escape; 2) 3 inmates get captured; or 3) you run out of time at the end of the 15th round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Die Englisch Detektive&quot; is an educational game for enhancing children's vocabulary in English as a foreign language. It uses the interactive electronic tiptoi&reg; pen (sold both separately and in combo packages with games).<br/><br/>The players (or player, as this can either be played cooperatively or solo) are detectives. They are trying to stop Professor Mad, who is wreaking havoc in several places in town (professor's laboratory, zoo, museum, TV studio, open-air concert stage, toy store, detective's headquarters, fast-food restaurant). In order to stop him, they have to complete assignments in all these places. If a player completes an assignment, he/she earns a medal. If an assignment fails, Professor Mad gets the medal instead. The players win if they have more medals than the professor at the end of the game.<br/>  <br/>The electronic pen is used to discover the main game board and the eight location boards. Tapping components with the pen triggers an audio explanation of the components, and the pen also tells the players the English words for the objects whose depiction they have tapped. An info button triggers hints and rules explanations. The pen also functions as a game master and a die: when all players have registered their player tokens, the pen chooses a start player. The active player taps his token with the pen, and the pen tells him how many spaces to move. It also announces three locations as the current targets for assignments. If a player reaches one of these locations, he takes the corresponding location board and tries to complete the assignment. Assignments include things like tapping a correct number or color code, or musical instruments. All the instructions are given by the pen and the players have to associate the English words they hear with the corresponding pictures. When an assignment is completed, the pen announces a new target location. (There are always three active locations, and all eight locations are used in every game.)<br/><br/>",

Germany's U-boats are better known, but the US Navy's submarine fleet achieved the greater victory, bringing the Japanese Empire to its knees by hollowing out its merchant fleet. In this solitaire game, you the player represent the skipper of a submarine. Your task is to conduct patrols against the Japanese by supporting the US fleets in combat, ambushing Japanese warships, carrying out covert operations in Japanese territory, and sinking merchant ships and tankers. You can conduct one of several individual patrols, or fight the whole campaign, with a goal of promotion to Captain&mdash;if you survive.<br/><br/>Patrols are assigned by a die roll against a possible set of missions, but the set changes through the course of the war. In each, you move your boat across the situation map, that covers a quarter of the map, at 375 miles per hex, to the chosen island, ports, or shipping route. Some of the counters represent Japanese naval forces and installations, which you either seek or avoid depending on your mission. Each action covers 1-to-3 hexes and may result in enemy contact.<br/><br/>You decide whether to engage, and choose your boat's actions&mdash;depth, speed, course, and weapons&mdash;to hit the juiciest targets and avoid their escorts. At the end of the patrol, your tally is based on ships sunk and other mission parameters, less the damage to your boat. High scores result in promotion; low scores leave you beached.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 280 counters<br/><br/>Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #311<br/><br/>",

On a turn, someone flips seven letter tiles face up, then each player writes a word using some combination of these letters on their personal dry erase board, trying to score as many points as possible. You write down the score for your personal word, then whoever has the highest score uses the face-up tiles to place their word on the shared central game board. Everyone else then writes this word on their dry erase board in place of whatever they had.<br/><br/>You then refill the tiles so you again have seven face up, then each create a new word on your board, building off the word already there. Collectively you'll build a shared interlocking grid of words, but you're scoring individually for your creations. Who will up with the most points?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overview<br/>A solitaire print-and-play siege/defense game. Using just a standard deck of playing cards and a record sheet, the player defends a city against a stream of attackers, trying to hold out until the deck is exhausted, at which time a score may be figured based on how well the city survived.<br/><br/>Originally created on a business flight because I wish I had something I could play on a tiny airplane tray and all I had was a deck of cards and a notebook, it has been playtested and developed further as a submission for the Solitaire Print and Play Contest in July 2011.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>The record sheet divides a city into four sections, each with defenders, walls and city ratings. Each turn, the player will use hand cards to generate reinforcements, repairs, defensive sorties and other special actions based on the rank and suit of the cards he has. Afterward, the enemy troops appear based on card draws where each suit corresponds to a quadrant of the city and the rank indicates strength. However, each suit of enemy has an ability or advantage that makes them a little different from each other when attacking or appearing. The attack process is straightforward and occurs automatically each round after both the player and the enemy have played their cards.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game the player may make more informed decisions about how to spend his cards based on which cards he's already seen come out of the deck, but luck (good and bad) is still present in which cards he gets in hand to spend and where and in what order the enemies arrive. Many cards can be spent in more than one way by the player, so there is a degree of hand management as well.<br/><br/>The game is designed to play with a standard deck of cards and a record sheet, making this a very portable, small-footprint game. I've played it holding the whole deck in one hand and simply placing the discards face-up at the bottom of the deck, while making my notes and tracking information on the record sheet.<br/><br/>",

During each turn, players alternate picking &quot;command markers,&quot; which designate the sub-command within their force they may then use to conduct operations. The player then moves units of that sub-command and, at the completion of its movement, conducts attacks with units of that same sub-command. Play then passes to the other player, who similarly picks a marker and moves and fights. That procedure continues until all command markers have been picked. Additionally, certain events cause players to pick &quot;heroism markers&quot; at random, which may generate anything from mad, impetuous charges to abject surrenders.<br/><br/>The rules are divided into the standard rules, which are common to all games in the system, and the scenario rules, which provide deployment and reinforcement instructions, as well as victory conditions, for each specific battle game.<br/><br/>In this game, each turn represents one to two months, depending on the time of year, and each hexagon on the map represents 9.3 miles (15 kilometers) across. Units of maneuver for both sides are battalions and regiments, artillery batteries, and  a few miscellaneous units of smaller sizes.<br/><br/>",

Planet Surprise is a game in which you can fulfill your dreams of exploring the universe. Perhaps you can find out what's hidden on the planet in the shape of a tennis ball, or what's in the mysterious flying box?<br/><br/>The game is wonderfully minimalist as each player has only one scratch card (similar to a scratch ticket). On your turn, you can land on a planet, which means that you scratch the scratching layer of one planet (with a fingernail or a coin) and look at what is hiding underneath. You will always find a point value underneath, positive or negative, and also certain surprises in the form of funny graphics. The goal is to uncover the planet with the highest score. (During ten actions, you will uncover about ten planets out of sixteen.) Each set includes different deployment of points and different jokes.<br/><br/>Instead of scratching, you can navigate the opponent to land on a planet of your choice, without doubt the most beautiful one of those that you discovered. Some actions will allow you to gain insight into your opponent's game so that you might know better on which planets it pays to visit and which to avoid.<br/><br/>Planet Surprise originated as a little brother of a much larger project, a fantasy offline/online game with scratch cards called Scratch Wars. All you need to play Planet Surprise is one scratch card for each player, but they need to be all from the same set of cards (as players need to explore the same universe).<br/><br/>",

In this variant, players can purchase additional cards to improve their hand.<br/><br/>Each player receives the same amount of credit to start the game.  After anteing 5 credits, they are dealt the standard 5-card hand, and taking turns, they can look at and purchase up to 6 cards at increasing costs, e.g. 1 for the first additional card, 3 for the second, and so on, to improve their hand.  The credits they used to purchase the cards go into the pot.  After everyone had their chance to improve their hands (or had quit the round by folding), they reveal their improved 5-card hands and the player with the best hand (according to standard poker rules) takes all of the pot.  The next round then starts, repeating the anteing-and-improving-hand process.<br/><br/>The game stops when one of the players cannot afford the ante; at that point, the player with the most credit is declared the winner of the game.<br/><br/>",

This game uses an updated, and slightly expanded, version of the Bitter Victory game system: no CRT, buckets o&rsquo; dice, and cards...a totally new approach to gaming battles that can be learned in five minutes and played in 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. BSO Games, however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or Heavy Weapons). No CRTs, no siree!<br/><br/>The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They don't &quot;drive&quot; the game and they can be left out, if you&rsquo;re so inclined.) The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units or bring in Reinforcements. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.<br/><br/>The cards, themselves, give the players &quot;Opportunities&quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent&rsquo;s) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement.<br/><br/>Playing time for Blackshirthas averaged less than 3 hours, and the rules are only 6 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire.<br/><br/>Each game of Blackshirt includes Rules, one sheet of Mike Lemick&rsquo;s colorful cut-and-paste counters, two small decks of cards, and a snappy Pascal da Silva map (in one piece!)&quot;<br/><br/>Available in English or French<br/>1 rules and scenario booklet with historical introduction (8 pages)<br/>1 A3 map of Lybia and Egypt - 20 colored Opportunity Cards - 140 counters (NATO Symbols) -<br/>The Sicily map and the Opportunity Cards have been designed by Pascal Da Silva<br/><br/>Uses the Same System As:<br/><br/>    Bitter Victory<br/><br/><br/>Reimplimented by: Blood & Sand published by Worthington Games<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fun survival board game that is set in a cartoon-like environment. The game board is compiled from 37 individual tiles, which are placed randomly and face down. The turn system is fast paced. During your turn you can carry out the following actions in any order:<br/>A. Move to any adjacent tile (1x). If hidden, the tile is revealed instantly.<br/>B. Pick up a new card from the deck corresponding to your tile (1x).<br/>C. Use cards in combinations or on their own (unlimited times).<br/><br/>There are 200 game cards divided in 5 tile types (40 each). Each zone has different possibilities of cards to find. There are 23 different game cards. Some of these cards can be used on their own, but others only in 10 specific combinations.<br/><br/>The game has different rule variations and the main game modes have somewhat opposite goals, which are: <br/>1) Survivor - the goal is to be the least hungriest when someone loses.<br/>2) Last Survivor - the goal is to stay in the game for as long as possible. So it is played till everyone but one loses.<br/>3) Forage - the goal is to be the first to reaches 20 forage points.<br/><br/>During the game-play you can place traps to protect your territory against other players or to hunt (each deck has 6 wild boar cards - which start their movement on the board). Also each deck has 3 Depleted Tile cards - which means that you cannot stay in one place all the time. The game board will get more and more depleted as the game advances. It's also possible to play long enough to have all the tiles depleted. At this point you still carry out your turns as you normally would, only there are no cards to pick up so you have to play with what you got left in your hand.<br/><br/>The expected gaming session highly varies depending on the player count, their luck/skill level and the game mode you have chosen to play with maybe including also some optional rules.<br/>For 2 players the Survivor mode can take as long as 2 hours to play out while the Forage mode can take as fast as 30 minutes. With 5+ players it's quite the opposite - the more players you got the faster the game will end in Survivor mode, while in Forage it will go on much longer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; in the town of Backwater that don&rsquo;t belong. It fills the air with energy, like it feels before a storm. Except this storm ain&rsquo;t one of wind and rain, but bullets and blood.<br/><br/>King of the West is a weird west themed area control card game. Three different sets of characters will be available at launch. One set can be played as a 2-3 player 18-card area control game, but multiple sets will allow for up to 9 players with the modified rules variant.<br/><br/>For the area control variant setup, nine building cards are randomly played on a 3x3 grid to make up the town. Six buildings are generic locations and the other three are the unique target locations. Since they are played randomly, the location of these target buildings will be different in every game.<br/><br/>Players can take three actions on their turn: Claim a Building, Move, and Shootout! Shootouts are how you remove opponents from the buildings you want. You do this by trying to get into your opponent's head and outthink them using a nuanced rock-paper-scissors combat system.<br/><br/>The game ends when either a player starts their turn controlling all three target locations or they are the only player controlling any buildings in the town.<br/><br/>With multiple sets and a larger player count, your still fighting over buildings, but instead of gaining a new location every turn, you are limited to what you start with. Players can't be eliminated though and when you run out of your buildings, you can steal someone elses. Other than that, combat works in the same way and the winner is the last person (or team!) left with claimed buildings.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/><br/>King of the West' card game set 3: The Banished, including The Reaper, The Phantom, The Shade, and their locations.<br/><br/>",

Units are divisions along with army HQs and some air units.<br/><br/>DAMOS is a brand new, unique take on operational scale WW2 gaming that features almost 0 player downtime. DAMOS takes tried and true wargaming conventions and repackage them forcing longtime grognards to re-approach how they think of operational tactics. Units can react, choose combat postures, and get huge exploit opportunities when they overkill an enemy.<br/><br/>Army Group Center covers Von Bock&rsquo;s relentless drive on Moscow. Logistics must be maintained as the German army advances while the Soviets must stem the flow of Panzers as best as possible.

Hurrying a little and elbowing your way through the bar is okay, but if you aren't careful and overshoot the mark you're back on the street again.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>Collecting as many points as possible by winning the most valuable drink cards.<br/><br/>Game play<br/>The board shows Lola's Bar with a couple of tables, a parcours consisting of several spaces, and the counter. At the counter, you can get sparkling wine (&quot;Sekt&quot;) or soda (&quot;Selters&quot;). To reach the counter, you roll the dice.<br/>On each turn, you roll up to three times and move one of your four pawns the corresponding number of spaces. Pawns have a value of 1-4. For the first roll, you use one die, for the second roll two dice, and for the third roll three dice, and you have to use the same pawn in each of your up to three rolls per turn. In between rolls, you can decide to stop and end your turn. If one of your pawns reaches one of the four counter spaces, you get the top sparkling wine card (sparkling wine cards are stacked face up). <br/>Sparkling wine cards mostly have positive values, some of them show a dot before one or several zeros (.0, .00, .000). The dot means that you use your pawn that reached the counter to determine its value, i.e. if your pawn with value 4 gets the .000 card, it is worth 400 points. The pawn is put on the card and stays there for the rest of the game.<br/>If you roll too high and your pawn passes the counter space, you get served soda, i.e. you draw the top of the face-down soda cards. Soda cards mostly have negative values (-10 to -1000), and there is also a card which bans you from the bar (i.e. your token is removed from the game).<br/>If you land on a special space, you have to use this particular pawn.<br/>There can only be one pawn per space. If you'd land on a space that is already occupied, the other player decides which closest free space (either backwards or forwards) you have to move your pawn to.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has no pawns left. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each Artist gets a geometric shape which they should use in their artwork. The twist is that it is a fully cooperative game, so the Artists draw the constellation as a team, but they can not discuss what exactly everyone should draw. Try to find Silence or Spring constellation on your page of the sky atlas! It is not easy, but great fun!

        "description": "Published in 1998, and based off of The Universal Soldiers tabletop miniatures rules by Colin McClelland, Paul Sharpe &amp; John Laing, this game is similar to Mordheim, in its fantasy skirmish theme.  The theme in this game, however, is that of rival mining companies fighting for success in the mines/dungeons/caverns &quot;surrounding the underground holdings of Arkonis.&quot;<br/><br/>The base game comes with two sides:  the Dwarven Prospectors vs. the Vanir (dark elves) and their &quot;terrible&quot; spider minions.<br/><br/>The game features upgrading units, hiring mercenaries, and buying weapons and equipment between scenarios.  The combat rules are more streamlined than that of Morheim, and the campaign game is more fleshed out.  You can buy add-ons to the home base of your mining company that can do numerous things for you.  Things that increase income, security, etc.<br/><br/>Many battles take place in the corridors of the mines, but the battle can be taken to a player's home base if needed.  As such, players map out their home bases as they purchase rooms (e.g. jails, vaults, storage, etc), fortifications (e.g. gates, walls, traps, etc), and other assorted upgrades on to them.<br/><br/>RAFM has released other races to play, including Orcs, Undead, and &quot;Reptiliads&quot; (lizard men) to name a few.  In addition, the game works very well with the line of dungeon scenery from Dwarven Forge.  The playing time noted above should be considered the time for one or two scenarios, including the in between campaign management.  But, like most games of this type, it can go on for as long as you like.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player is the Chief Executive Officer of a high-tech company.  Each turn, players may trade, pay their salary, play up to two cards, pay old and new workers, and re-draw up to four cards.  Then the Economic Index is adjusted, and all companies are payed based upon the overall state of the economy and the ability to control monopolies.  Cards include a variety of companies, boom and bust, changes in the labor pool, accounting scams, anti-trust and stocks.<br/><br/>Because it is possible for all players to lose, some cooperation is necessary within an overall competitive framework.  Although the Economic Index may seem at first to dispense its rewards and penalties equally, clever players will soon find that they can manipulate it to their advantage.  Similarly, while supply and demand regulates the availability of labor, there is room for maneuvering as players strive to pay workers as little as possible while avoiding having the workers stolen away by higher-paying rivals.  As Chief Executive Officers players can name their own salary, but if they raise it too far too fast they will soon find their company in economic trouble.<br/><br/>Game play basically falls into two parts; early, the players control small startup companies and maneuver to build them into large corporate entities.  In the game's late stages, great manipulation is possible, and excellent timing necessary, as each player struggles to amass the greatest personal fortune possible without going to jail, and to end the game at the perfect moment.<br/><br/>The game takes 2-5 players and usually lasts from one to two hours.<br/><br/>",

The board shows a fairly complex network of spaces, most of which have arrows on them showing mandatory movement direction.  Some spaces have two arrows, offering a choice.  In the center the board are four spaces with stars on them.<br/><br/>If you move onto an opponent's piece, you capture it and place it on your &quot;Speed Card&quot;.  As your speed card fills up, you move faster: capturing two pawns allows one of your pawns to move up to three spaces while the other two may still move only one or two spaces.  Capturing four pawns allows two pawns to move three spaces each, and your sixth pawn captured lets you move all three pawns up to three spaces.  Once you've captured eight pawns, one may move up to four spaces, and so on.<br/><br/>The game is basically following the arrows and moving around the paths trying to capture opponents.  You can also capture pawns by moving onto two star spaces in the same turn.  These can be captured from opponents' starting spaces or from an opponent's Speed Card.<br/><br/>Last person with any pawns left alive wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The suit cards run from 1 to 11 (there is no A4 or A9). The entire deck is dealt out to the players. The player to the left of the dealer starts by laying down any card from his hand. The player who holds the next higher card in the suit (regardless of where they sit at the table) must follow, laying the card down on the table (D4 followed by D5 for example). Then whoever holds the next higher card plays that, thus continuing in sequence (unless blocked) until the high card of the suit is reached.<br/><br/>Whoever plays the high card (or blocks) gains the Lead, and starts a new sequence by playing any suit card from his hand, thus getting rid of two of his cards. If you have a Block card and you wish to &quot;block&quot; a sequence, you play the next card in the sequence paired with the Block card. You then Lead the next sequence, thus getting rid of three of your cards. As the hand continues, natural blocks occur due to players leading with cards in the middle of suits. The player who plays the A5 or the A10 card wins an immediate 5 or 10 points respectively.<br/><br/>When a player plays his last card, the hand ends, and that player receives 1 point for every card left in the other player's hands. He also scores 5 or 10 points if the A5 or the A10 cards remain unplayed. A player still holding a Block card loses 5 points as a penalty. The first player to score 100 points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Saturankam is an ancient game from India that is similar to Sadurangam and Ashtapada. It is played on a 9x9 board of cells with a winding path that spirals to the center. The middle squares along each edge and the square in the center of the board are safe places where pieces cannot be attacked. Movement is determined by two four-sided dice. The object is to enter pieces on the middle square on one's own side of the board and race them to the center. Each player has two pieces. Pieces that are not on safe squares can be hit and must be reentered, as in Pachisi.<br/><br/>",

Then maybe, those 'Mongol hordes' just might make it upon the island shores during a successful &quot;Invade Japan!&quot; game session.<br/><br/>Description from the back of the box:<br/>The military historical game the Battle by Okehazama is based on the events that took place June 1560 in Japan, at the height of the Fighting Provinces period. It was the time when all the Japanese Samurai clans clashed in the combat for power. In the battle by Okehazama the small army of the Oda clan defeated the lmagawa troops by sudden attack. A new general Oda Nobunaga entered the combat for power.<br/><br/>This game is for 2-6 players. The enemy armies led by the players meet near the bay of lssa, in the valley of the Pinar river. Battle characteristics of the armies are close to the reality. Tactic maneuverings are very important in the game. Under a skillful leader a smaller army can defeat numerous enemies. You can either recreate the historic battle or change the course of the fight. Anyway you should rely not only on the number of your army but also on your leadership and war skills.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Totally is a game of arranging numbers so that they add up to a given total. It can be totally frustrating as you struggle to find a spot for a final number, but it's always totally fascinating and totally fun.<br/><br/>This game plays like a numbers Take It Easy.  One player randomly selects 15 of the 30 numbers available in his color, and the other players select those same numbers from their pool. Then two &quot;key total&quot; tiles are selected and revealed.  The players then attempt to arrange their tiles in such a way that rows and columns equal one of the two key totals, with their figure based around only one of the key totals.  When one player announces they are done, a three-minute timer begins and the remaining players must finish their work before the time runs out.<br/><br/>Scoring is done by multiplying the number of tiles used in horizontal lines by the number used in vertical lines and then subtracting five times the face value of any unused tiles. The players with the highest scores for a round receive bonus points.<br/><br/>The later magazine edition of the game was basically the same, but only had 20 tiles for each player and had slightly different scoring (unused tiles subtracted a flat ten points each).<br/><br/>",

The opposing team comes to bat and the cards are reshuffled.<br/><br/>Special rules can be made. For example, it is optional to advance all base runners one extra base on a single and a double. This game may also be played as a party game where players take positions on bases.<br/><br/>A record of the balls, strikes and outs may be kept by a member of the opposing team calling out each card as it is turned over.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From GAMES Magazine review:<br/><br/>On your turn, move two poles and two ports. Poles can move one or two spaces orthogonally, or they can teleport. A port has two ways of moving: It can either reorient (that is, spin so that its right angle is flush with any corner of the space it occupies), or it can glide across the board like a chess rook. A port forms a teleport by landing on a square with another of its color, with each right angle in opposite corners of the square. A teleport enclosing an enemy pole sends the pole back to one of its home spaces.<br/><br/>A pole teleports between any two of the following:  friendly teleports, home spaces, and goal spaces (except that a pole can only teleport to a goal space from another goal space). Poles can be blocked by port walls or other poles, but they can also move between the board's left and right edges as if the edges were connected. A pole completely blocked by the opponent teleports home.<br/><br/>",

Each of the spaces shows a different animal; the same animals are also printed on the tiles. At the center of the board there is a clearing.<br/>The 5 monkeys are placed on random spaces. The animal tiles are shuffled and placed next to the board in a face-down stack. Players take turns drawing a tile and then look for the corresponding space on the board. Then they try to reach that space with one of the 5 monkeys. Each of the monkeys carries 1-3 fruits, and this number shows exactly how many spaces that monkey can move. If none of the monkeys can reach that space, the tile is removed from the game. If a monkey succeeds, the tile is placed on the clearing space that shows the fruit which the successful monkey is carrying. Then the player may also place the monkey on the clearing. Monkeys that have been placed on the clearing stay there for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when all animal tiles have been used or all monkeys are on the clearing. If there are 7 or more animal tiles and 3 monkeys on the clearing, the players win the game. Only animal tiles accompanied by a monkey count.<br/><br/>",

They come in 6 different designs, having 1-4 sides in the player's color and 0-3 sides in neutral white.<br/><br/>Every turn, a player draws one of his tiles and places it on the board according to the placing rules. Since the players have no tiles in hand to choose from, the chance that a tile cannot be placed (and a turn is missed) is relatively high. However, the unplayable tiles come into game later.<br/><br/>The game ends, when either all tiles are laid out or no further placement is possible.

The &lsquo;hero&rsquo; in this lovingly-produced game is the seller Johann, who has lots of tasty things for sale. Ready for the big sales, Johann, represented in the game as a seven cm high wooden figure, has not only the appropriate shopping tiles but also shopping bags in different sizes. And unfortunately, not everything fits into them! Little math artists will have to figure out more than just adding one plus one to make sure that only those things that belong land in the bags. The rest just wouldn&rsquo;t fit.<br/><br/>Primo Calculino doesn&rsquo;t just add enjoyment, it also subtracts and multiplies it. And so, while playing, mathematical abilities as well as memory and concentration are built. The nice thing is that nobody outside of adults will notice.<br/><br/>Description of the game from Selecta Spielzeug:<br/><br/>A mathematical learning game with many variations.<br/><br/>You can put so many tasty things into your bag, but sometimes, they don&acute;t all fit!

        "description": "Japanese Submarine Offensive in the Eastern Solomons September 1942.<br/><br/>Sensuikan is a simple strategic simulation of the attempt of the Japanese Sixth Submarine Fleet to prey the U.S. carrier groups engaged, during the opening days of September 1942, in covering important convoys carrying reinforcements and supplies to Guadalcanal.<br/><br/>Sensuikan is a solitaire game in which a single Player controls both the opposing forces. The Player will command the Japanese submarine force by playing the role of Vice Adm. Komatsu Teruhisa , who, between August and September 1942, prepared and ordered the I-boats offensive from his headquarters in Truk. By contrast, the Allied escort groups will operate in accordance with a strictly defined set of rules. The specific game scenario will allow the Player to simulate the crucial moments which led on 15th September to sink the carrier U.S.S. Wasp and to hit some units of another carrier group built around the U.S.S. Hornet. As a consequence, the Player will be able to understand the logic of a submarine force whose potential was underestimated even by the High Japanese Command, and perceive the tension of Japanese sub-commanders in their ultimate search for high estimated preys, personal glory and, most of all, respect.<br/>    Specific rules for random events, like intelligence resources or air raids, will add to the realism of the game. Concurrently, these elements will also offer the opportunity to examine through a different perspective, limits and contradictions to the Imperial Japanese Navy management of its &lsquo;silent service&rsquo; during one of the most intense (and largely unknown) phases of submarine warfare of the entire War in the Pacific.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Speedy Gonzales is an original race game, where chance has a rather large part, but also tactics are important. The game is played in two phases. In the first phase, the players set their water-gourds - small tokens - along the route. In the second phase, the race itself, each player on his or her turn is confronted with a difficult choice -- either drink one or more water-gourds, and then roll a die for as many gourds drunk (with distribution - 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4) and advance the number indicated, or advance one space without using a water-gourd. Players can collect water-gourds by landing on spaces with them, but cannot carry more than three at the same time. For those not far-sighted enough to plan for the future, some wells are available along the way.<br/><br/>",

A player's turn essentially consists of two parts: A move in which one of the player's meeples moves either on a path or through the jungle, cutting down all or some (or none) of the rattan on the way; this costs rattan itself. Afterwards, the player rolls four dice to plant four new rattan plants anywhere on the board, but only in places adjacent to as much rattan as one die shows.

More residences on each block means more points.  And civic improvements -- such as churches and schools -- can boost the value of a block.  But watch out:  homes can only be built where commerce supports it.  And urban blights -- like jails and slums -- can reduce a profitable city block into a landlord's nightmare.<br/><br/>This is a free print and play game.

Originally, Haiku: The Card Game only played like the variant mentioned below named Haiku Hustle, which makes a good party game but experienced gamers demanded more, as did the designer.<br/><br/>While the core of the game, forming Haiku from the cards you collect, remains the same across all six variants, each of the six different rule sets change how you do that dramatically.<br/><br/>Haiku Helpers<br/>In this collaborative version, designed for younger gamers, players are awarded points for completing lines in a Haiku both in front of them and other players. The game is over once all players have a completed Haiku in front of them.<br/><br/>Haiku Hustle<br/>One of the simplest game modes, this version focuses on completing Haiku&rsquo;s quickly and the winner deciding who made the best Haiku. This version works great in a party setting or as an introduction to Haiku.<br/><br/>Haiku Rummy<br/>The quality, as well as quantity, of Haiku plays a major factor as an end of the game <br/>scoring round may determine a winner based on the quality of their best Haiku.<br/><br/>Haiku Auctions<br/>Players outbid one another for a chance to recite their Haiku in front of the Emperor and gain Favor points. In the end, only the player who scored the most valuable favors will win.<br/><br/>Haiku Seasons<br/>In this version, special Season Cards allow players to retain parts of their Haiku for points while a simultaneous action mechanic introduces special voting rounds.<br/><br/>Haiku Stackers<br/>A quick paced abstract variant which focuses on building up or breaking down the <br/>Syllable Cards in a communal Haiku to maximize your point value.<br/><br/>",

The version allows to play the game with two players sharing a mobile phone or tablet device.<br/><br/>Two opponents play on a board with 5 x 5 fields. Each player has 4 pawns. The pawns are aligned on the opposite borders. Both players have a pair of pawns on each side at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>In alternating manner players move one of their pawns to an empty adjacent field next to it. You can move in any direction: vertically, horizontally, and diagonally, too. Jumping is not possible.<br/><br/>Aim is to build a perfect square with own pawns (while shouting out and announcing MONDRAGO then). These perfect squares can be aligned in parallel to the edge of the board or be diagonally aligned or be oblique aligned as well.<br/><br/>A quite similar game developed independently from Mondrago (1992) is Teeko (1945). It could somehow be called a predecessor maybe...<br/><br/>Another game that fits in that row is Artyom Tchebotaryov's Quartetto (2008).

One team controls four titanic skyscraper-toppling monsters, the other directs the efforts of Kaiju City to defend itself and drive off its invaders.<br/><br/>The monster team stomps their way through the city destroying as much as they can as quickly as possible using special powers like poison breath and causing earthquakes. Destroy the city and the monsters win! This team provides a lighter gaming experience allowing monster players to focus on stomping their way to victory.<br/><br/>The City team draws and places tiles allowing them to manage resources and mobilize the military to engage and destroy the invaders. Kill four monsters and the City team wins! This team provides a more strategic gaming experience as the city players must choose their tile placement carefully as well as managing their resources to ensure that they have what they need to drive the monsters from their beloved Kaiju City.<br/><br/>Experience an asymmetrical game design and have several tons of fun crashing through buildings and zapping monsters with your lightning cannon!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ARK the Great Race is a Family Board game that can be played from 2 to 6 players. The age group that we have suggested is 8 years and up, however younger children as young as 6 still can grasp the concept of the game. The game consist of 6 Noah figures, large playing board, 336 playing cards, 6 Ark pieces with card holders, 2 card trays and dice.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to collect as many animal pair cards from as many coloured regions in the time allocated. To start the game each player positions his Noah piece and Ark to correspond with the coloured starting icon on the board.  Each player then rolls the dice; the highest roll starts s first. As you move around the game board you will come across 3 different icons; 1. Coloured Region spots, 2. Rainbow spots and 3. Question mark spots.<br/><br/>Landing on any 1 of 7 coloured region spots will entitle you to receive a corresponding coloured animal card. These animal cards consist of male, female and paired animals. Each colourfully illustrated animal card is unique to its region and comes with 3 descriptive facts and animal sound. When you pick up an animal card you must inform the rest of the players what the animal is without revealing its sex. These cards must be collected in pairs and placed in your Ark to be protected. Unpaired cards are placed face down in front of each player until such time the corresponding male or female card is collected.<br/><br/>Rainbow spots are randomly placed around the playing board. Landing upon one of these icons allows the player to receive a Rainbow card. These cards can alter the course of the game in a very exciting way. This card set consists of good cards and not so good cards. The good cards can offer the player protection, extra animal cards and the chance to disadvantage your opponents. The not so good cards can damage your Ark and allow other players a chance to take your animal pairs which are no longer protected by a completed, undamaged Ark. Rainbow cards can dramatically change the outcome of any game in the dying minutes.<br/><br/>Question mark spots allow the player to win other players animal cards by correctly guessing not only the animal card but the correct sex. Guessing correctly also entitles you to another turn. When you land on a question mark spot you can ask any other player 1 question. If you are having difficulty remembering who has what animal card you may chose to ask that player to read any 1 of 3 animal card facts on that card. Remembering other player&rsquo;s animal cards will definitely give you an advantage in game play.<br/><br/>",

One player picks the Light Deck and the other plays the Darkness Deck.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to bring your opponent down to zero Crystals in their Crystal-Pool.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 10 Crystals (represented by 10-sided dice) and plays Characters, equips them with magical Relics and has them perform powerful Abilities. Your Crystals double as &quot;Life Points&quot; and resources.<br/><br/>At the beginning of your turn you draw 3 cards from your deck, then you may discard a card from your hand and add a number of Crystals to your Crystal-Pool equal to the Crystal Value of the discarded card (which doubles as cost to play the card from your hand). Then, in Main Phase, you may play Characters and Relics and have your Characters attack the opponent. Each unblocked attack results in 2 Crystals being removed from your opponent's Crystal Pool. If at any point a player has no more Crystals left in their Pool, they lose the game immediately.<br/><br/>Crystal Clash consists of two preconstructed, well balanced decks with 40 UNIQUE cards each. All the cards are illustrated in Anime-Style by Manchen Yang (the Darkness Deck) and Laurie Thomas (the Light Deck).<br/><br/><br/>This game is a cooperative effort by Andreas Propst and Nora Propst, Andreas' younger sister.<br/><br/>If you want to take a look at all 40 different Darkness Cards please visit<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://ap.o-nan.org/2012/11/crystal-clash-darkness-deck-all-cards/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://ap.o-nan.org/2012/11/crystal-clash-darkness-deck-all-...</a><br/><br/>If you want to take a look at all 40 different Light Cards please visit<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://ap.o-nan.org/2012/11/crystal-clash-light-deck-all-cards/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://ap.o-nan.org/2012/11/crystal-clash-light-deck-all-car...</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Visegrad 4: The Coming War in Eastern Europe covers a hypothetical conflict between the forces of the Eastern NATO and Russia. With the US in retreat in the world, and the Russians getting overly aggressive, it could be that a resurgent Russia could make an attempt to take back its classic sphere of influence. This, factored in with the fact that Russia is the primary energy source for much of Europe, has made them overly powerful. The biggest threat to the Russian energy dominance is amazingly the country of Poland. Recent technological breakthrough in &lsquo;Fracking&rsquo; has made the Polish shale resources the number one competitor to Russian energy domination. So, once again, the two nations may well be on a collision course to destiny.<br/><br/>The other assumption made for the background of the game is that Germany, caught in the grips of an isolationist government, and not willing to risk rocking the boat with its primary source of energy, declares Poland the aggressor and that it will be neutral in the NATO &ldquo;violation&rdquo;. The US, already weakened from its own internal problems, is unable to force them to honor their commitments. The resulting chaos and confusion will delay the entry of much of the NATO forces and force Poland and its neighbors to go it alone.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: 1 week<br/>    Hex: 35 miles / 56 kilometers<br/>    Units: Brigades or equivalent <br/><br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>    One dual-side printed countersheet (176 5/8&quot; counters - 128 for this game, 48 for Red Dragon / Green Crescent published in Modern War Magazine #1).<br/>    One 16-page rulebook<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-10 hours<br/><br/>Note: Players will need to provide one 6-sided die for game play.<br/><br/>",

Where one side fights to keep the Light of Faith alive, the other side fights to see it extinguished, replaced forever with Blessed Night.<br/><br/>This Box-set Contains:<br/><br/>A full colour card model of the Brotherhood Cathedral: on eight A4 sheets of card for you to construct.<br/>    Two exclusive new miniatures only available with this box set: The Brotherhood's - &quot;Visionary&quot; and the Dark Legion's - &quot;Angel of Mercy&quot;.<br/>    A 32 page booklet, containing 10 scenarios that can be played as stand alone battles or as part of an extended campaign, where the fate of the Cathedral depends upon the success or failure of each scenario. There is separate descriptive text and maps for each scenario and battle photographs throughout to put the struggle for the Cathedral and the two new characters in context.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to be the first player to reach home, without being caught by the bear! Youngest player goes first and rolls one dice and move that number of spaces in the direction of the arrows on the board. If a player lands on a 'Uh-uh' space they must take a card from the top of the card pile. If the card is red 'We can't go over it' this ends their turn. If the card is green 'Oh no! We've got to go through it' they can roll the dice again and move forward.<br/>When a player reaches the 'Run' space they must stop and take full control of the game. Throw both dice and move your character that number of spaces, then throw just one dice and move the bear that number of spaces chasing after you. Keep going like this, it's a race to try and get home before the bear catches you. If you reach the 'Home' space before the bear catches up with you, you win!<br/><br/>This game has strong educational components and helps children learn through social interaction as well as taking turns, all whilst having great fun. The game is for 2 - 4 players and suitable for children ages 3 years and up.<br/><br/>",

Good luck and let cod be with you!<br/><br/>Each turn in No Fish!, players guess a number or special fish type. If they guess correctly, they release all of those fish from their hand and may take a special action; if they guess incorrectly, the other players call &quot;No Fish!&quot; and that player has to draw a card from the fish deck. The special action fish &mdash; Starfish, Toadfish, Flyingfish, Lionfish and Monkfish &mdash; are what separates this game from a generic number-guessing game to a game of strategy, bluffing and manipulation.<br/><br/>Each pack contains 54 cards: four types of basic fish (Goldfish, Dogfish, Rainbowfish and Clownfish) numbered 1-10, five types of special fish (Starfish, Toadfish, Flyingfish, Lionfish (three copies of each) and Monkfish (two copies)).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sushifuda is a sushi-inspired take on the traditional Hanafuda matching card game from Japan. However, instead of featuring plants and flowers like traditional Hanafuda, Sushifuda depicts kawaii-style sushi art! Collect the most points by matching sushi types and use bonus sashimi 3-card combos for extra points to win!<br/><br/>The game features 12 suits which represent the 12 months, each month containing 4 cards depicting the type of sushi for that month. 2 cards typically are point cards in the suit while the remaining two are normally chaff (no points). There is one wild card called the Gaji or Lightning card which allows you to take non-matching cards.<br/><br/>Games can play with from 2-6 players playing singly or in teams, each round lasting only about 10 minutes. Quick, fast-paced, easy fun from ages 7 and up! You can also play a solo variation.<br/><br/>The cards are marked for Sakura-style play, with point totals and months designated on the cards for instant recognition. Also included are reference cards containing the sashimi bonus point 3-card combos (also known as Yaku). Reference cards are double-sided standard poker playing card size while the main suits cards, which total 48 in number, are half the size, based on traditional Hanafuda. This allows for great portability and also a smaller footprint on your table while playing. All cards and the tuck box come UV coated and linen finished, made of the same cardstock as Magic: The Gathering. Great art collectible, playable cards!<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to use your cards to create hilarious insults that score damage points that remove the &quot;lives&quot; from your opponents. The last player left with lives wins.<br/><br/>Each card has two words are phrases on it and an associated point value with each one. Play proceeds clockwise starting with the player left of the dealer.<br/><br/>Each turn the player can either play an insult on anyone at the table OR exchange any amount of cards from their hand for new cards. An insult is 4 or more cards that when read aloud, form a complete sentence that insults another player. Example:<br/><br/>YOUR JACKED, BUCK-TOOTHED GRANDFATHER LIKES TO SPOON WITH A NEUROTIC, TINY CHICKEN!<br/><br/>The player lays down the cards that forms their insult, points to a player they are insulting, and reads the sentence aloud. You imply the punctuation with how you speak the sentence. So say it like you mean it!<br/><br/>You then total the points on the read side of each card in the insult (upper right corner).<br/>If this total is 5 or more, the insulted player loses 1 life.<br/>If the total is 10 or more, the insulted player loses 2 lives<br/>If the total is 15 or more, the insulted player loses 3 lives, AND the insulting player takes one of the lost lives and adds it to their own lives.<br/><br/>There are &quot;Reversal&quot; and &quot;Redirect&quot; cards that the insulted player can play to deflect an insult. The insulting player can play a &quot;BOOM&quot; card at the end of their insult to make it unreversable and unredirectable.<br/><br/>Argle Bargle is a casual game, but it takes more than luck to best your opponents. It requires creativity and strategy.<br/><br/>There are no dirty or offensive words in this version.<br/><br/>",

Give each player a score card and two cubes. Players place one cube on the 0 space of their score tracks and keep the other aside for later scoring in the tens columns of the score track.<br/><br/>2. Shuffle the deck of 48 cards and remove the following         number of cards from the game:<br/><br/>3 players - remove 6 cards<br/>4 players - remove 5 cards<br/><br/>3. Deal 6 cards to each player. Place the remaining cards in a draw pile. Draw three cards from the draw deck and place them in the center of the table with a card space between each.<br/><br/>4. The youngest player is the Starting Player.<br/><br/>To Win:<br/>Have the most victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Play:<br/>Beginning with the Starting Player, and proceeding clockwise, players may take one of two actions on their turn:<br/><br/>1. Play a card face up and adjacent (left or right, above or         below) to any previously played cards in the playing area.         For each card that is adjacent to the card played (left or         right, above or below), and matches the color of the played         card, gain one victory point. If none of the adjacent cards         match in color, gain victory points equal to the value of         the played card.<br/><br/>2. Play a card face up on top of a previously played card.         These cards must never match in color and the card being         played must have a higher value than the one it is covering.         Gain victory points equal to the sum of both cards (the card played and the one below it) and then remove both cards from the game.<br/><br/>The current player then draws a new card from the draw deck to place in their hand. If the draw deck is empty, the player will not draw a new card. It is now the turn of the player to their left.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/>After all players have played their last card and their hands are empty, the player with the most victory points is declared the winner and all the fish can yo!<br/><br/>Advanced Game:<br/>Before the game begins, deal one card to each player from those removed during setup. These cards will be kept hidden by players during the game. At the end of the game each player will receive additional victory points equal to the largest number of adjacent cards whose color matches the player&rsquo;s hidden card. Two or more players may have the same hidden card color.<br/><br/>",

You take mini pizza's from the tray in front of Freddy Fazbear.  Watch out, because if you mess around with his pizza's too much he JUMPS!<br/><br/>Basic Game Play<br/>You set the game up by pressing Freddy into a locked position.  Take all the total of 24 mini plastic pizza pieces in red (8) blue (8) and yellow (8) and put them in the pizza tray/box in front of Freddy.<br/><br/>Time to turn Freddy on, once you do that, you will hear the haunting  Calliope style music plays in the main base of the game.<br/><br/>Each player on their turn spins the multi colored spinner which has corresponding colors to the pizza slices - Each slice on the spinner has a number value.  That is the number of pieces you have to remove from the tray in front of Freddy.  On the dial there is also a skip a turn, but in this game that is a good thing!<br/><br/>The players uses a bear paw shaped salad style tongs (grey in color) to pick the pizza slices out by the color and quantity shown on the spinner.  As you reach in, there is a lower level tray bottom that is pressure sensitive and will slowly based on the number of times you agitate, randomly activate Freddy to jump at you and spill the pizzas all over the table top!<br/><br/>(If at any time a color is spun that is not in the tray, a player must take another color pizza instead)<br/><br/>The winner is the one that does not find themselves the unlucky person that made Freddy JUMP!<br/><br/>If playing more then two players, then the person that makes Freddy jump is eliminated.  Players return the pizza back to the tray, set Freddy up again and continue playing in the same manner.<br/><br/>Once it is down to two players, then the overall winner is the one that does not set Freddy to JUMP!<br/><br/>(If the players remove all of the pizza before Freddy wakes, then the game ends in a tie)<br/><br/>Requires 3 AA Batteries<br/><br/>",

The last player with cards remaining in their life deck is the winner.<br/><br/>Players begin with a small deck of face-down cards that make their life deck and a single Hit! deck in the middle of the table. During a player's turn, they draw a card from the Hit! deck and place it face up for all players to see. They continue to play cards until they choose to stop or they Bust and are out of the round.<br/><br/>If a player draws a Hit! card, they place it in front of any other player. If the current player stops before Busting, all other players will discard 1 card for each Hit! in front of them. All cards are added to a communal discard pile. If the Hit! deck runs out of cards. All of the cards in the discard pile are reshuffled to make a new Hit! deck. If a player draws a Trip! card, they place it in front of themselves. If a player ever draws 3 Trips! they Bust, and they instead discard 1 card from their life deck for each Hit! in front of all players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The scent of spaghetti dances in your nose and you can almost taste the roast beef being slowly cooked and it&rsquo;s almost as if the kid shaking sprinkles on their ice cream is happening right in your ear. You&rsquo;ve never been this hungry and you can not take it much longer. The cashier asks for your money and you dig into your pocket looking for your wallet and as you grab it you see yourself shaking. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay&rdquo; you think to yourself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m almost there&rdquo;. You hand the cashier your money and with a smile as warm as fresh cinnamon rolls you hear &ldquo;enjoy!&rdquo;. But as you walk through you start to notice something is terribly wrong. People are fighting with one another, stealing from unsuspecting victims, and devouring food for the worry that it might be gone any moment. Fear hits you suddenly as you notice a sign at the front of the buffet &ldquo;NO REFUNDS!&rdquo; and before you can gather your thoughts you hear someone whisper in your ear, &ldquo;Are You Gonna Eat That?&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Are You Gonna Eat That?&rdquo; is a 2-5 player game played in about 30-45 minutes. Over the course of three rounds you will earn points by devouring the most amount of dishes at the table, but be careful as your opponents will be trying to steal your food! Food cards are placed faced down in front of you; hiding their respective point values.  Using a wide variety of action cards you will be able steal from opponents, play defensive cards, and even gross dishes removing them from play; but beware of opponents tricking you into taking their rotten foods.  Spice up your dishes by playing add-ons on your dishes or trap other players by placing add-ons of opposite flavors onto a dish causing it to be worth negative points.  Still hungry? Fill up your plates using empty plate tokens to steal even more food, all is fair game until a dish is devoured.<br/><br/>",

A rival gang is lobbing Punkin Bombs at your various clubhouses around town&mdash;trying to bring them down, and take over your turf. It's time to fight back!<br/><br/>How To Play<br/>Separate the &quot;Clubhouse&quot; cards from the deck and deal 3 face-up in front of each player. Place the rest of the deck face down between all players. The player left of the dealer has first turn.<br/><br/>For each turn, players draw up to 5 cards (the hand limit), and then may play only 1 card of each card type. Punkin Bomb cards are played in front of a player's house to attack it. Witch cards are played behind a house to strengthen it. Ghost cards are played on the last bomb placed on a house to remove it to the discard pile, and Vampire cards may be paired with a card to play an extra card of that type during a turn. A turn is over when no card can be played. If a player already has 5 cards at the start of a turn, draw 1 more card. Play continues clockwise.<br/><br/>When the total value of all Punkin Bombs played on a Clubhouse equals (or eclipses) its value (plus the value of Witch cards behind it), the Clubhouse is destroyed/removed from play. All cards played on the Clubhouse go to the discard pile. Should the game deck exhaust, reuse the discard pile.<br/><br/>The last player with a Clubhouse left, wins!<br/><br/>",

When you have gathered enough memory, you remember a good deed and score points.<br/><br/>During your turn, you try to stack a number of wooden blocks. If you fail to stack them, your turn ends immediately; if you succeed, for each block you stacked, your pawn advances one square or you gain a fragment. Depending on the square where your pawn lands, you gain additional fragments or convert fragments into a fragment of better quality, or you may spend fragments to regain the full memory of your deed, earning several points. Turns go clockwise, and the next player begins their turn by stacking a number of blocks on top of the existing stack.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, if any player has scored 40 or more points, the game ends. Players score their end-of-game bonuses, and the highest scorer wins the game and enjoys a good start for their next life.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>„Éª„Éó„É¨„Ç§„É§„Éº„ÅØÊ≠ª„Å´„Åæ„Åó„Åü„ÄÇÈñªÈ≠îÊßò„Å´ÂñÑË°å„Çí„Ç¢„Éî„Éº„É´„Åó„Å¶„ÄÅ„Çà„ÇäËâØ„ÅÑÊù•‰∏ñ„ÇíËøé„Åà„Åæ„Åó„Çá„ÅÜÔºÅ<br/>„ÉªË≥Ω„ÅÆÊ≤≥Âéü„ÅßÁü≥„ÇíÁ©ç„Åø„ÄÅÂñÑË°å„Ç´„Éº„Éâ„ÇíÁç≤Âæó„Åó„Å¶Âæ≥ÁÇπ„ÇíÁ®º„Åé„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ<br/>„Éª40ÁÇπ„Å´Âà∞ÈÅî„Åó„Åü„Çâ„Ç≤„Éº„É†ÁµÇ‰∫Ü„ÄÅÊúÄÈ´òÂæóÁÇπ„Éó„É¨„Ç§„É§„Éº„ÅåÂãùÂà©ÔºÅ<br/>„ÉªÁç≤Âæó„Åó„ÅüÂæ≥ÁÇπ„Å´„Çà„Å£„Å¶„Éó„É¨„Ç§„É§„Éº„ÅÆÊù•‰∏ñ„ÅåÊ±∫„Åæ„Çä„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ<br/>„ÉªÁ©ç„Åø„Ç¢„ÇØ„Ç∑„Éß„É≥„Å®Êà¶Áï•„ÇíÁµÑ„ÅøÂêà„Çè„Åõ„ÅüÂÖ®„ÅèÊñ∞„Åó„ÅÑ„Ç≤„Éº„É†„Åß„ÅôÔºÅ<br/><br/>",

Each round uses a different dragon's lair, so you need to be as crafty as you can to win.  Plays in 30 to 60 minutes and up to 8 players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cr&oacute;nicas del Estallido is a cooperative game about the social protests in Chile in late 2019. Gameplay resembles Anno Domini/Timeline, but the game is played cooperatively: <br/>Each player has a number of event cards in front of them. The cards show an event on the red side, and the same event plus the day it happened on the yellow side. Players keep the red side of their cards up, so they cannot see the date. One random event is placed in the middle of the table. Players now take turns placing one of their cards either on the left or the right of the initial card (and subsequent ones) to form a correct timeline of events. When each player has only two cards left, the placed cards are flipped to the yellow side. For each card that is at the correct place of the timeline, the players score a point. The more points, the better the result.<br/>Group discussion is encouraged, with the card holder having the final word about where to place a given card. <br/>The game is aimed at keeping memories about the series of events alive. <br/>No individual designer is named, as the game was a colloborative effort by many people, but there is a long list of credits. Each card was also illustrated by a different artist.<br/><br/><i>User summary</i><br/><br/>",

The other pair shows colors: blue, yellow, and red--again, each one corresponding to one of the characters. The game also has 20 counters.<br/><br/>Players roll either pair of dice. If they roll the dice with pictures and each dice shows a different character, players grab for the third character not shown on the dice. Whoever grabs the character first gets one counter. If the dice match and show the same character, players grab for that figurine and the first to get it takes a counter.

At game's end, players are ordered from first place to last place. As long as you are in the top half of all players, you are still a winner! It is fast-paced: there is little waiting between turns, and a game normally ends within 10 minutes. Rules are straightforward and easy to learn. The game teaches young children how to track and sequence numbers, recognize patterns, assess probabilities, and develop strategies: the game avoids use of face cards that impede learning of numbers. It is family friendly (ages 8 and up) - adults will not dominate! It is great for groups: an unlimited number of players (with more boxes) can easily play together in one giant game. Freestanding tiles provide a satisfying tactile experience; no racks are needed and no more fumbling to hide cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Fabula Rasa, players take turns telling a constantly changing story as is typical of oral traditions. The motifs on the cards provide visual bullet points for people, objects, and locations that are central to the action, things that must be remembered in the correct order, with cards disappearing and new ones being added each round. Those who, as a narrator, manage to present their version of the story without errors will be rewarded accordingly.<br/><br/>Fabula Rasa: Horror contains 30 cards that feature characters (Dracula, werewolf, zombie), objects (carriage, cape, torch), and locations (castle, village, sinister alley) that can be combined with either of the standalone games Fabula Rasa: Crime or Fabula Rasa: Seemannsgarn.<br/><br/>",
