        "description": "Action-Mat Football is a tabletop dexterity game themed after American Football. Players advance the ball along the playing surface (a 30 x 65 inch mat representing a football field) by flicking it with their fingers, thus causing it to slide on the playing surface. Each flick of the ball represents a play.<br/><br/>Prior to executing each play the offensive player chooses which type of play to use and determines where on the field he will place the individual members of his team. Simultaneously the defensive player places his individual team members on the field, in an attempt to guess the offensive play. After the defensive player has placed his tokens the offensive player then places his tokens according to the play previously chosen.<br/><br/>As in real football, the offensive player has four general options on each play: passing, running, punting or attempting a field goal.<br/><br/>In order for a pass play to be successful the offensive player must flick the ball, causing it to slide along the playing surface, ultimately contacting one of his own tokens. The player tokens consist of flat cardstock and when the ball token slides over top of them they tend to slide along with the ball token. When the ball stops sliding, if there is only an offensive player's token still caught underneath it, the play resulted in a pass completion. If there are one or more player tokens from each team, the pass was incomplete. If one or more tokens from the defensive team remain under the ball token, with no tokens from the offensive team, the pass was intercepted.<br/><br/>Running plays are not executed by sliding the ball. Instead both players secretly deploy their individual player tokens to any of the multiple eligible running lanes on the field. If the offensive player deployed his ball carrier to a running lane that was left unguarded by the defensive player, then he simply rolls three dice with the result being the number of yards gained on the play. If the lane is guarded by a defensive player, then both players roll a single die, and the yards gained (or lost) is determined by subtracting the defender's result from the offensive player's result.<br/><br/>Punting is performed by sliding the ball token down the field. If the ball slides into the endzone the receiving player can choose to start their drive at the 20-yard line, or attempt to return the punt by rolling dice to determine yardage.<br/><br/>Field goals are made by finger-flicking the ball token into the air and through a set of plastic uprights.<br/><br/>",

Golomb in a talk to the Harvard Mathematics Club in 1953, which was later published in American Mathematical Monthly and in Scientific American.  Pentomino puzzles had been described before, but it was Golomb who coined the name and described a game for one to three players.  Others have published their own variations, but the game described by Golomb consisted of an 8 x 8 grid of squares and a set of twelve pentominoes.  Players take turns placing the pentominoes on the board, taking care not to overlap the pieces or to use a tile more than once.  The last player to place a pentomino on the board wins the game.<br/><br/>Note: A separate database page exists for the 10 x 10 grid version of Pentominoes, as published by Taskmaster Ltd.<br/><br/>",

The harder the question attempted, the more dots the player is entitled to join together on that turn. After joining 25 dots the host sets the first clue to help identify the picture. A second clue was given at 35 dots, and a final clue at 40 dots. These clues should be written by the host and disclosed only to the relevant player.<br/><br/>A player calls &quot;Dotto&quot; if the picture is recognized at any stage of the game. The answer is given and written to the host, undisclosed to their opponent. More points are awarded for earlier recognition as each unconnected dot earned 5 points. A player must give the name of the picture to the host once all the dots are joined. The host announces whether the guess is correct or not. If correct, the second player has one attempt to guess and so draw the game. If drawn the game is repeated.<br/><br/>Alternative games can be played such as double Dotto where the value of the dots is doubled. If a player gives an incorrect answer the game is over. The opponent received no points but is victorious and remains to fight a new challenger. Any number of rounds may be played, at the end of which the player with the highest points scored is the winner.<br/><br/>",

By playing cards to the free-form play area and then placing cubes on them to record their contributions, they hope to have their work be recognized by the Queen at story time.<br/><br/>Scoring is similar to Acquire, where the person with the most cubes scores the normal value of a card, and the second-most gets half that value.  This scoring is triggered when someone plays a card with a low enough rank -- the more workers on a card, the more likely it'll get scored by a particular play.<br/><br/>The number of workers you place each turn is based on the number of matching suits touched by the card you play.  This leads to natural clusters of suits, shaped implicitly by the opinionated nature of the deck.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, or a player runs out of workers, or a player reaches 100 points, the game ends with a final scoring round.  The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The main goal of each player is to use game cards inspired by the world of archaeological science and collect so called scientific points.<br/><br/>The first player who reaches the required amount of scientific points wins the game. Obtaining those points depends on the abilities of individual cards (and their combinations), that are used for construction of gaming decks. These cards are divided into five main card types. A player can play artecafts, archaeological sites, scientists, event cards and cards of so called written sources. Cards are also divided in unique and non-unique categories (unique means that you can play a card just once, non-unique cards can be played multiple times) and temporary (especially event cards) and permanent cards. Every player owns his or her own constructed deck, whose construction and the ability to defeat an opponent depends clearly on his or her combinational skill and his or her own inventiveness.<br/>During the game players draw cards from their decks and play them from their hands. They can play cards to support their gaming strategy or to disturb the opponent's game.<br/><br/>The game primarily serves as an instrument of popularization and education in archaeology.<br/><br/>",

The spinner also has two spaces which indicate the player should draw a card instead of move a certain number of spaces.

Combat is a simple dice rolling affair that stresses attrition, and reinforcements are given to players who collect sets of cards.<br/><br/>Careers is a game where the players set their own victory conditions.

The players endeavor to fulfill their goal by going through any number of different &quot;occupation paths&quot;. All paths have some prerequisite for entry, and benefits accrue from going through any of the paths more than once. The different occupations are designed to be suited to different strategies, eg. Hollywood is good for fame points, while &quot;Going to Sea&quot; is good for happiness.

        "description": "The match box was dropped and all the matches are mixed up. The goal of the game is to find as many matching pairs as possible. The game plays similar to the classic memory game Concentration, but there are a few twists.<br/><br/>Half of the cards will be face down and the rest will be face up. The start player will lay down the cards in a 3x3 grid. Each player should look at the cards as they are being put down, as it is important to remember the cards &amp; placement. Just like in the classic memory game, the players try to find a matching pair. Whoever says &quot;match!&quot; gets a try. When the cards match, that player takes the cards, which will score at the end of the game. If 2 different cards are picked, these go to the discard pile and the player receives one of the yellow burning matches. If no one else sees another match, the remaining cards are reshuffled and the next player places them in the grid.<br/><br/>The game ends when all cards have been claimed, or if the 5 burning matches are in play. The player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

The giants are large stand-up boards with punch-out circles representing hits to the head, torso, arm, or feet.<br/><br/>Tokens are shaken in a cup and placed in a pool on the table. One side of the tokens is a color matching each player with a number, and the other side has a magic, weapon, or gold symbol. Players draft tokens  With the gold they hire their army, with the magic they fuel their wizards, and with the weapon they activate their fighters. Once a giant is hit, the striking player gets the punch token. When a giant is dead, players roll dice, based on their punch tokens, for victory points or more fuel tokens. If the numbers showing on the tokens when they come out of the cup equal 7 for any particular player, that player has a troop killed in combat.<br/><br/>",

However if the Panzer Army, sent to the Hungarian Front, was defending the capital, the final result could have been different. On the other hand, if the Soviet forces besieging the fortified city of K&ouml;nigsberg had concentrated their fighting power in the center, the fight might have been bigger than historical.<br/><br/>The German army is specialized in mobile counterattacks by armored troops and the Soviet army has excellent breakthrough ability and large concentrating firepower.<br/><br/>Two scenarios: campaign (Deutschland Kaputt! January-May, from the Vistula-Oder operation to the fall of Berlin and Prague) and Der Katastrophe (January-March 1945).<br/><br/>1 turn = 2 weeks<br/>1 hex = about 20 km<br/>1 Unit = German Army: Battalion to Division, Soviet Army: Corps<br/>Number of players = 2<br/>Play time = 6 to 10 hours (depending on the scenario)<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    308 pieces (12.5 mm square)<br/>    One map (A1 size)<br/>    One rule book (12 pages)<br/><br/><br/>(adapted from Japanese website text)<br/><br/><br/>The game system is similar to Hongrie 1944-1945 (Vae Victis #78, Command Japan #100) system.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A light political game involving vote placement and based on &quot;The 2010 Election&quot; but aiming to cover the May 2015 election. It attempts to model the movement into four party politics and the rise of the SNP.<br/><br/>The two players (Labour and Conservatives) place population markers derived from opinion polls (run by Press Cards) in 32 representative Constituencies. The Constituencies are grouped by type (rural, industrial, suburban) and by the three home nations (England, Scotland and Wales - Northern Ireland is dealt with separately). Other parties are placed according to rules that mimic their strengths and weaknesses by random draw from the Scrabble bag.<br/><br/>In each phase of the game different placing rules apply as you move from placing your hardcore supporters (who tend to be in safe areas) up into the floating voters (who can be anywhere) on Election Night.<br/><br/>At last we abandon further fiddling and offer (for a mere sum of &pound;5 via paypal; to charles.vasey@gmail.com) the next in the series from the 2010 Election. This time we are trying it in advance of the actual event.<br/><br/>The game kit (for it is a mere primitive PNP) is a number of pdfs and spreadies giving you the map of UK represented as blocks of constituencies, the counters, and the press cards. It is pretty much an experience game.<br/><br/>There will be an update after the actual Election.<br/><br/>The pdfs should resize for Letter printing, but if not I'll save in Letter and then copy over.<br/><br/>",

No Lookie's roots are in the line of games like Golf or Polish Poker but brings a variety of new mechanics that offer the modern gaming experience to a vintage, time-tested archetype.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to have the lowest score each round.  A hand consists of five cards dealt faced down to each player.  Without looking at the cards, players arrange their hand into two faced down rows in front of them:  a top row of two cards and a bottom row of three cards.  The rest of the deck is placed in the center of the table as a draw pile.  The top card is turned over and starts the discard pile.<br/><br/>Gameplay follows with draw-discard turns.  Players are allowed to look at the bottom-row cards prior to their first turn, but are not allowed to look at their cards again until the end of the round (except when discarding of course).  Various action cards may be discarded to trade, swap, or effect gameplay.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, the two rows score points and the player with the lowest score receives a victory point card.  For scoring: each card in the top row adds its numerical value to the player&rsquo;s score; if all three cards on the bottom row match numerically then all the cards in the bottom row score zero, but if all three cards do not match numerically then each card in the bottom row adds its numerical value to the player&rsquo;s score as they do on the top row.<br/><br/>1 deck plays up to 6 players<br/>2 decks play up to 12 players<br/><br/>73 Cards per deck:<br/><br/>    51 Number Cards<br/>    2 Wild Cards<br/>    13 Action Cards<br/>    7 Victory Point Cards<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Terrenus, the players become gods playing a game with the mortal world. The game is player in four phases, each a simple mini-game with different rules, but each building where the other left off. Each phase is roughly ten turns per player. The four phases relate to various godly activities:<br/><br/>Creation - The gods build the game world, using a tile placement mechanism. Each god will place ten, and score points based on number of edges connected and terrain features completed.<br/><br/>Population - Each god has 40 tribes to competitively place on the board, usually 3-5 at a time. The finger of god touches an origin square, and life spreads from it. Terrain features limit how many tribes can fit in an area. Points are scored based on how terrain is filled. This phase feels a little like Go.<br/><br/>Construction - With the world populated, the gods migrate tribes together. When enough are in a square, they build a temple to whichever god has a majority in their stack, and leave the board. Rival tribes are captured and converted by this process.  Points are scored by using tribes to build temples, and by converting rivals' tribes. This feels vaguely like the city building mechanic from Civilization (original).<br/><br/>War! - The world is now full of temples. The gods each have a monster and a hero to summon from their temples on their turn. Monsters seek to defile rival temples, making them more difficult to summon from. Heroes go to fight rival heroes and monsters, or just vandalize a rival temple. Points are scored for slaying, defiling and robbing. This phase can feel like the endgame of Chess.<br/><br/>Each phase has a method of earning bonus points. At the end of the last phase, the gods total their scores to determine a winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ayoayo is a Nigerian mancala game, which is played by the Yoruba. It should not be confused with Oware, which is also sometimes called &quot;Ayoayo&quot; when played in Nigeria. Related games are Andada in Eritrea and Endodoi in Tanzania.<br/><br/>Ayoayo is played on a board of two rows, each consisting of six round pits that have a large store at either end. Each pit contains four seeds at the start.<br/><br/>At his turn a player takes the contents of one of his smaller holes and distributes it, one by one, counterclockwise into the following holes, but not in the stores. If the last seed falls into a non-empty hole, its contents including the last distributed seed is continued to be distributed.<br/><br/>The move ends when the last seed falls in an empty hole.<br/><br/>If the last seed falls in an empty hole on the player's own side, the seeds in the opponent's hole directly across and the seed effecting the capture are captured and placed into the store. If the emptied hole contains twelve or more seeds, it is skipped.<br/><br/>When the opponent has no seeds in his holes, he must get some seeds in the next move, if possible. Otherwise the game is over and the remaining seeds are captured by the player who moved last.<br/><br/>The player who captured most counters wins the game.<br/><br/>Description taken from Mancala World.<br/><br/>",

If a skull is rolled they lose a die and gain no treasure.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with 10 ships and 3 dice. If at any time a player can't place a ship or runs out of dice to roll they have to remove all their ships from the map and they lose all their treasure.<br/><br/>In the end the player with the most booty wins.<br/><br/>",

All you have to do is play your cards right and best those other cats!<br/><br/>The cats all start with the same cards: 1 Catch, 2 Stalk, 1 Play, 1 Steal, 1 Taunt, and 1 Eat. No luck of the draw here, it's entirely up to you! Get as many enjoyment points as possible and win the game! Be clever and anticipate what the others will do so that you can claim victory. Each player will target another cat and a location where a bird is hanging out. They will then select their actions for the 2 rounds of action. All of the cards are revealed simultaneously, they get resolved and when the smoke clears, some cats may have birds and some may not.<br/><br/>The birds will hang out at the bird bath, in the grass, on the fence or in the trees. The bigger birds will need to be stalked before catching them and you will have to time everything just right. Once you do catch your bird you will have a choice to either press your luck and play with the bird to double its enjoyment point value or to just eat it. The longer you play with it the greater the chance of it being stolen by another cat.<br/><br/>Taunt cards allow other cats to distract you and cancel your actions, nothing is safe in this back yard!<br/><br/>",

Separate the deck into 3 decks, the draw deck A/2/3/4, the Market Deck 5/6/7/8/9 and the board set up 10/Jokers/J/Q/K. Set up all KQJ10s in four rows of same suits placing Jokers on the tens and randomly draw four face up cards from the market deck below the tens. KQs are the Royal Council and the Jacks separate the council from the marketplace. The draw deck is where you legally earn money by drawing cards, the market deck gets drawn into the marketplace when cards are reserved or purchased. Purchase cards with cards of the same color.<br/><br/>When cards are discarded or spent they go face up into the appropriate decks discard section where market cards become the black market and draw cards become heists. To do illegal actions such as purchasing from the Black Market or perform a heist you must bribe a face card by placing a card higher than previous card of the same suit on the card taking lower bribe into your hand. Anyone can bribe a Jack but you must pay off a Royal for there loyalty. Pay off Queens first which cost 25 Of its suit minus the Jack bribe, same for king but also minus the Queen bribe, place a player marker on Royal. Royal bribes are always scored as end points but the game ends and scores differently in ways of play.<br/><br/>There are 3 different variants of Corrotto: Ladies First, Hot Potato and Rat Race.<br/><br/>",

Players are attempting to meet a specific challenge stated by that round (e.g. play over a certain number, play under a certain number, etc.). Every player that plays the same numbered card is considered on a team for that round, and their played value is increased by the number of people on the team.

Follow the set up rules and a numbered card will be designated as the bomb. The game is spent trying to learn what number that card is. <br/>Guess right and you disarm the bomb and win! Guess wrong... well you know. (BOOM!)<br/><br/>Each turn a player must choose one of three actions.  You can either draw a red card, draw a blue card, or guess the number of the card in the case.  The red cards are numbered 1-10 and one of these has secretly been designated as the &quot;bomb.&quot;  The game is spent revealing the red cards to narrow down the possibilities of the &quot;bomb&quot; card.  However, the numbered card that was removed has been replaced by a detonation card which has been shuffled in.  If this card is drawn from the red deck, the bomb goes off and the game is over.<br/><br/>The blue deck is made up of tools that help you navigate through the red deck without blowing up.  There are three special powers that come from the blue deck that let you look ahead and even disarm a detonation.  These are meant to help you reveal cards from the red deck because ultimately you can only win by revealing the red cards.<br/><br/>Most games end in defeat, but you'll have a blast losing and want to play &quot;just one more game&quot; each time.

A town icon means you generate a town (draw 3 cards) and choose one townsfolk to interact with from the town. A monster icon means you draw a card and battle the monster on it. If you win, you will earn treasure!<br/><br/>Complete three quests before you run out of Resolve or Health and you win.

Lasers burn across the tabletop, rail-gun slugs smash through armoured hulls and advanced cyber-warfare weapons hack through vital systems &ndash; the war zones of the distant future are no place for the faint hearted.<br/><br/>Firestorm Planetfall puts you in the role of a Grand Commander, orchestrating the maneuvers of your chosen army. Each of your Battle Groups will contain several Helixes of stunningly-detailed 10mm scale miniatures, ranging from towering Leviathans to numerous bases of Infantry, all prepared to fight to the last under your command.<br/><br/>Your planetary invasion force will be formed of troops from one of the six core races, who in turn belong to one of two sides: the Zenian League or Alliance of Kurak, vast alliances currently fighting for dominance of the Galactic sector. Each of the six races has its own complex motivations within the conflict, as well as entirely unique vehicles and distinct ways of fighting their battles.<br/><br/><br/>Firestorm Planetfall is a miniature tabletop wargame, set in the Firestorm Armada universe. The game uses 10mm miniatures and dice to reproduce future combat during planet invasion.<br/><br/>Firestorm Planetfall is a revised and updated version of Firestorm Invasion: Planetfall, with significant rules changes.<br/><br/>- Force construction is different and now uses the helix system, <br/>- Reinforced Target Zone markers were removed, <br/>- STAR cards were replaced by TACs (Tactical Action Cards), and - squadron activation no longer uses cards.<br/><br/>The helix system has also been blended into game play, in that you must activate every squadron within a helix before moving to another helix, and the turn structure is also different.<br/><br/>",

Two to four players move around the play area, made up of hidden Spell Cards, collecting and combining sets of cards to make powerful spells to unleash on the other wizards!  The aim of SOURCES is simply to defeat your opponents - the last wizard standing wins!<br/><br/>Spell Cards come in four types, representing the power Source for each wizard &ndash; Fire (red), Earth (green), Water (blue) and Air (yellow). In each of these four Sources there are seven spell types (Molten Rock, Fist of Air, Acid Spray, Cone of Cold, The Orb, Sound Wave and Concussion Bolt).  Combining these together in sets of one Source, or one spell type (eg. Molten Rock), creates spells that cause damage.  Even more powerful spells can be made by combining specific sets of spell types in one Source colour.<br/><br/>Players start with 20 Life (indicated by a d20), a hand of four Spell Cards, and the play area is laid as a 4 X 4 grid of Spell Cards that start face down, with the remainder of the Spell Cards set aside as a draw pile.<br/><br/>Each turn, players can perform a number of different actions once each:<br/>- Take a Spell Card from the draw pile if they have a hand of fewer than four<br/>- Move their wizard avatar from one Spell Card in the play area to another adjacent card<br/><br/>     Reveal the Spell Card their avatar is on, choosing whether to trade this with one in their hand or not (either way a Spell Card has to be replaced back in the play area)<br/>     Attack another player by discarding a set of three Spell Cards.  There are three types of attacks:<br/><br/><br/>1- Source attacks - three Spell Cards from the same Source colour, this type of attack only does 2 damage<br/>2- Basic spell attack - three Spell Cards of the same spell type (eg. Molten Rock) from any of the four Source colours, doing the damage indicated by the spell type (1 to 7 damage)<br/>3- Advanced spell attacks - each Spell Card has a combination attack written on it, consisting of three different spell types (all in the same Source colour). These attacks are the hardest to collect, and do the most damage (8 to 12 damage).<br/><br/>",

The game is composed of 100 black Prompt cards and 285 white Response cards.<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>FUBAR can be played by 4-20 people, and is compatible with the Cards Against Humanity base game.<br/><br/>The deck was designed for all four real branches of the military and the Coast Guard so there&rsquo;s enough hate to go around.<br/><br/>You guys know how this works. Prompt (black) and response (white) cards. Every player starts with a hand of ten response cards.<br/><br/>One player draws a prompt card and reads it aloud. The others each play a response card(s) they think is the most appropriate, amusing, or horrible. The player reading the prompt card shuffles the response cards, and chooses the one they like the most. The winner of the round takes the prompt card for a point, the answers are discarded, everyone draws to fill their hands, and the person clockwise reads the next prompt card.<br/><br/>If your cards suck (unlikely), or you&rsquo;re not funny enough to win a round (more likely) and you&rsquo;d like to redraw, just swap a prompt card for a new hand. If you&rsquo;re really hurting for wins you can also swap a prompt card for the opportunity to play two answers cards at once during the next round. If that doesn&rsquo;t score a point then maybe you consider stamp collecting.<br/><br/>Whoever has the most prompt cards at the end, or is the last one conscious wins fame, fortune, and everlasting glory.<br/><br/>",

In order to accommodate that, we'll update the rules and charts periodically online to reflect what is happening in the field.<br/><br/>The game counters (playing pieces) include combat units for: the Islamic State (&quot;ISIS,&quot; &quot;ISIL,&quot; &quot;Daesh&quot;), the Syrian Regime (including Russians), the Syrian Rebels, the Kurds, the Iraqis, the Iranian-backed forces (Shia Militia and Hezbollah), and the US/Coalition forces (USA, France, Britain, Turkey).<br/><br/>The map covers all of Syria and Iraq and the border areas. Depicted are the power plants, dams, oil fields, refineries and archaeological sites that the Islamic State exploits for cash. The map is color-coded to reflect the primary religious sects that divide loyalties there: Shia and Sunni Muslims, plus &quot;Tolerants.&quot; Fighting in an area that matches your Faction's religion helps you; fighting in the other areas helps your opponents.<br/><br/>The game is for 2-6 players. &quot;Momentum&quot; is a key concept - the player with Momentum starts and ends each turn.

        "description": "INTRODUCTION: TRENCH SOLDIERS is a solitaire game of Combat and Survival in the muddy trenches in France or Belgium during World War I. The player assumes the role of an Infantry Soldier during the grueling and miserable tour in the Trenches. As a Soldier, you are a member of a Rifle Platoon responsible for securing your Sectors of Front by successfully taking enemy positions and defending yours with the least amount of casualties. As you survive and gain experience, your Soldier will improve his attributes and gain skills to help him further survive the horrors of War in the Trenches.<br/> GAME OBJECTIVE <br/>The objective of TRENCH SOLDIERS is to successfully survive a Tour in the trenches along the Western Front during World War I. A Tour consists of a number of Rotations in the Trenches. The Player can play a Short Tour (1 Rotation), an Average Tour (2 Rotations) or a Long Tour (3 Rotations). Each Rotation consists of making a Rotation Deck of 20 &ldquo;Trench Life&rdquo; Cards and once all Trench Life Cards have been drawn and resolved, the Rotation is over and the Player totals his Rotation VP and adds it to his Tour VP. Once all Rotations have been completed, the Player totals his Tour VP and then compares it to the Victory Determination Table to determine the level of success. Players can choose to play as the Germans, French, Commonwealth (British, Australian/New Zealanders or Canadians) or the Americans.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES: TRENCH SOLDIERS features plenty of colorful Game Counters and Game Mat. The Game provides plenty of grim themes associated with the War in the Trenches. Counters include Infantry Soldiers, HMGs, Flamethrowers, MK-IV Tanks, A7 Tanks, FT-17 Tanks, Pillboxes, Aircraft, Sub-Machineguns and Light Machineguns from the various Combatants. In addition to the standard Western Front Campaign Scenario there is, also, a Gallipoli/Palestine Campaign with supporting Terrain Markers and Counters for the Ottoman Turks.<br/><br/>TRENCH SOLDIERS can be found at the following URL:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.berserkergames.net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.berserkergames.net</a><br/><br/>",

Players are trying to get the biggest &quot;pop&quot; from the audience by performing the better move/hold.<br/><br/>Each player takes a deck of 9 cards that make up their wrestlers moves set. These moves all have a numerical value that indicates how valuable that move is to the wrestler. These decks are shuffled and then each player will draw 2 cards.<br/><br/>After drawing cards players will assess what they have and potentially what the other player has and then choose 1 crowd reaction card. Crowd Reactions are used as a &quot;bet&quot; and go to whomever wins each round.<br/><br/>On a count of 1, 2, 3 each player slaps down one of their 2 wrestler cards and the higher value wins the round.<br/><br/>The catch (can) is that the highest moves in a wrestler's deck all have a different back to them so the opponent knows when you draw these cards. There is a also a hidden cheat card that each player has that will beat any of the higher valued cards.<br/><br/>After 8 quick rounds the wrestler who garnered the most crowd reaction is the ultimate winner.<br/><br/>2 Count! uses a mix of betting, card counting and reading the other player to create a fast playing card game for any wrestling fan.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "April 1st, 1970 was a nightmare that was not supposed to happen. The strategy of using Fire Bases (also termed Fire Support Bases) was created as part of President Nixon&rsquo;s  &ldquo;Vietnamization&rdquo; of the conflict in which US forces were gradually withdrawn and the bulk of the fighting turned over to the ARVN (Army of the Republic of [South] Vietnam). General George Casey, Sr. developed the Fire Base strategy in which US Artillery and other battlefield support assets were deliberately deployed in forward areas to disrupt the Communists&rsquo; lines of communication and supply, thereby inviting them to attack. Once the enemy was in the open and engaged the US forces would then call in massive amounts of air and artillery support to wreak devastation upon their foe. A Fire Base was only to be in one location 3 to 5 days, and extensive fortifications were not possible as everything had to be removed and redeployed by helicopter in a matter of hours. By April 1st 1970 Fire Base Illingworth had been in place for 11 days, allowing the NVA to completely map-out the American&rsquo;s positions, size up the garrison, and determine its weak points. Adding to Fire Base Illingworth&rsquo;s woes was the arrival of thousands of 8 inch artillery rounds on March 31st. The garrison had only hours to provide rudimentary protection for the new ammo dump by the time of the NVA&rsquo;s attack.<br/><br/>The survivors of Alpha Troop and Charlie Companies who were garrisoning the fire base thought they had reached a place of refuge where they could rest, recuperate, and train their newly arrived replacements (FNGs as they were derisively termed by the veterans). However, the NVA saw the opportunity to exact revenge upon the Americans grow with each passing day Fire Base Illingworth remained in place.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A quick historical family game for all ages.<br/><br/>The Exodus Of Israel is one of the most well known and preserved events of ancient times, being found in many sources, including the Old Testament writings acknowledged by the Islamic, Judaic, and Christian faiths. It follows the story of the tribes of Jacob, having relocated to Egypt during a severe famine. Initially welcomed due to the favor earned by Jacob's son Joseph, generations later forced into slavery by a Pharaoh who no longer remembered or cared for the growing nation of outsiders. The God of Jacob (re-named Israel before his death) hears the plight of the nation, and delivers them out of the hand of Pharaoh through a series of plagues which break down the hardened will of Pharaoh as well as show His power in the eyes of the region. Led by the prophet Moses, the Israelites are granted their freedom, and immediately make their migration (Exodus) back to the land promised them by God. The journey was not a pleasant one. Being in the desert with stressed resources, it often led to complaining, and sometimes outright rebellion against Moses and God Himself despite leading and providing for them.<br/><br/>This game is for 2-4 players, and at essence is a roll-and move game suitable for children. However there are also several elements of choice involved, and anyone with an interest in the Exodus story would enjoy following the path of the Israelites and being re-acquainted with the joys and pitfalls experienced along the way. The game can accommodate non-readers and readers alike, and has been designed to be playable independent of direct parental supervision. The winner of the game manages to make the journey from Egypt to the Promised Land with the most amount of points.<br/><br/>",

Therefore he has invited all Troubadours and Fools around to audition their best show. The winner will become Fool of the Feast and well rewarded.<br/><br/>Fool of the Feast is a light pocket card game for 2 - 4 players where you try to put on the best show for the King. Only three cards are played in a game round, but with split cards and special actions there is a more complex strategy to explore.<br/><br/>The second time a players show gets the king&rsquo;s favour - that player wins. A show consist of three rounds. Each round a card is played. First the entertainer presentation, then a fist act and lastly a second act. During the game the King reveal what he likes to see - and players now have to use the different card actions to make their show fit the Kings wishes.<br/><br/>The show with the most points total wins the king&rsquo;s favor that round. The crown icons on a card is basic points you will score for act. So more crowns means a better act. This will be modified by what themes the king like and don't like. So if the king laughs at your rivals &quot;juggling monk&quot; - you might need to mess that show up.<br/><br/>The goal is to become the king&rsquo;s fool - so basically everyone wins.<br/><br/>This game was originally a submission for the 18 card contest 2015. It was one the 18 finalists.<br/><br/>",

You need to be careful and quick, because if an alarm goes off or the site is surrounded by police, the game is over. Only if you master all the challenges will you be a true master thief.<br/><br/>In CleptoMania, every player is a thief. You can play on your own or in a team. The cards are laid face down on the table, are then mixed and arranged. The complete array of cards represents the scene of a crime. One player takes the first turn and flips over 2 cards. If two cards are turned over that are the same, something is activated, acquired, opened or the turn ends, depending on the cards. If two different cards are turned over (the exceptions are the alarm and the handcuffs), both cards are placed face down again and the turn ends. Once a player has finished his or her turn, the police, who are on the game board, move one space closer to the thief or the team. Then it is then next player's turn moving clockwise. If all the treasure and lock cards have been taken and the scene of the crime abandoned before the police have caught the thief or the team, the raid has been successful.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game consists of more than 300 small cards, each about 3/4&quot; square and bearing a single capital letter. The letters are distributed by frequency, ranging from six Q, X and Z to 24 E. The rules say to place all the letters in a box from which players draw blind.<br/><br/>In the Game of Words, players draw one tile at a time. The first two players put their letters on the centre of the table, forming a pool. Each turn thereafter, a player tries to use the letter in his hand to form a word from the letters in the pool. If he succeeds, the word is placed in front of him. Players may use their letters to add to another word to create a new, longer one, and &quot;capture&quot; that word from another player. They also may add their letter to one of their own words. Letters in a word may be rearranged. Unplayable letters are added to the pool. Players draw a new tile to end their turn. The player with the most words at game end wins.<br/><br/>In the Game of Sentences, players draw two tiles per turn and again try to form words. Words of only one or two letters are allowed, as are proper names, place names and possessives. The winner is the first to use all of his words to form an intelligible sentence of an agreed length. The rules suggest that five to 10 words forms a pleasant game.<br/><br/>The rulebook also contains rules for two more games, The Block Game of Words (where letters are face up and players can choose) and The Game of Alphabets (where each player thinks of a word, gathers the necessary letters and passes them to his neighbor, who then must try to figure out what word those letters spell).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>This game is a small scale skirmish level game where Superheroes and Villains face off against each other in a 3D tabletop set up. It could be a city, the Wakandan desert, the Savage Lands, the blue area of the moon or anything you like. In Marvel they fight anywhere.<br/>It is played on a 36&quot; x 36&quot; board so will fit on most tables without a problem.<br/><br/>In a game you will usually have between 4-7 characters on your team. Each of these characters act individually using their own Power to carry out different attacks and use Special Powers.<br/>Many can help or hinder each others though with boosts and actions like a Fastball Special.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to win set scenarios by completing different tasks and scoring Victory Points. These could be anything from take down / save the highest Level model in the team or rescue and keep a Cosmic Relic.<br/><br/>Each character comes with their own Stat Card which shows everything they can do. Attacks, Defence, Skills, Power, Damage and such.<br/>These are then used in a 2 D8 mechanic during the game. For example, 2D8 plus Attack Stat vs Defence Stat or 2D8 against your own Agility.<br/><br/>Magneto formed The Brotherhood of Mutants as a group dedicated to the cause of mutant superiority over humans. Throughout its various incarnations, the Brotherhood's agenda has gravitated towards either subjugating the human race to the will of mutants or eradicating humanity altogether.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Fruit Case, players attempt to collect sets of fruit to fill their baskets. Points are awarded for complete and partial sets.<br/><br/>The game contains 108 cards with identical backsides. On the front are the following:<br/><br/>    12 each of six different fruits<br/>    24 baskets with two fruits (blue background)<br/>    4 wild pineapples (purple background)<br/>    2 baskets with 3 fruits (purple background)<br/>    2 bombs (purple background)<br/>    1 rotten apple with a worm (purple background)<br/>    3 tree cards (brown background)<br/><br/><br/>The tree cards are laid face up in the middle, with at most one less than the number of players. Each player receives a two-fruit basket to start with and all other cards are shuffled. The starting dealer lays out, face up, a number of cards equal to the number of players. In turn, beginning with the dealer, each player chooses a card and places it in front of them. A player not wishing or unable to take a card instead takes one of the trees (if one is available in the middle). This tree may be returned to the center on a subsequent turn in order to take any fruit from the discard pile (instead of taking a card from the middle).<br/><br/>Each basket starts with two or three fruits already in it. A fruit card can only be added to the basket if that fruit is not yet present. Once a basket has all six fruits, all of its cards are stacked and turned sideways. Any number of baskets can be worked on at one time, but a fruit cannot be taken without a basket to go in.<br/><br/>The pineapple is a wild fruit, but each basket can only have one. If the bomb comes up in a deal, the entire turn is skipped and all cards from the middle are discarded. The rotten apple results in the dealer discarding one entire incomplete basket of theirs, if one exists.<br/><br/>After each round, the dealer role passes to the left. The game ends when there are not enough cards to fill the center. 5 points are awarded for each complete basket, with 1 point for each fruit card added to an incomplete basket.<br/><br/>Rules are also included for longer and shorter variants.<br/><br/>",

The wildly different personalities of the candidates suddenly transformed the nomination process into a civil war of fundamental differences. In GOP Nominee, you will take on the role of one of the four major candidates running for the Republican Nomination.<br/><br/>GOP Nominee is an asymmetrical game played over 6 Rounds where each round represents 1 Month of the Primary Elections (Including Super Tuesday which counts as its own Round). A 7th Round is possible if the game goes to a Brokered Convention.<br/><br/>In each Round, Support Cubes may be gained or lost to Candidates and Actions will be played in an effort to increase the probability of your Support Cubes being drawn during the Voting Phase of the Round. However, Mud Cubes will also be gained by Candidates, decreasing their number of Support Cubes added to the drawing. Voting results determine which Candidates gain Delegates and get that much closer to winning the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "World war one conjures up images of trenches, attrition, and overall stalemate. Indeed, much of the war beginning around 1915 was static and miserable with little hope of any decisive battle that would immediately end the war, but that was not the case in 1914.<br/><br/>The German Schlieffen Plan intended to outflank the French fortifications by moving through Belgium. The price was a British entry into the war to fulfill the international guarantee of Belgium's borders. Apart for some delay outside Liege, the German advance through France was nearly flawless in overwhelming the French &amp; Belgians in key opening exchanges which caused the BEF to avoid encirclement through a long retreat. At Villers Cotterets portrays the desperate rearguard action near Marne in which the British managed to severely wound a much larger force all while successfully withdrawing to fight another day, one of the first times the Germans had seen any kind of delay.<br/><br/>AVC portrays the desperate rearguard action nearing the end of Mons in which the British managed to severely wound a much larger force all while successfully withdrawing to fight another day. History is unclear about who really &ldquo;won&rdquo; the conflict, but you can settle it here and now, although 102 years later. AVC is a Grand Tactical game meaning units will have ranged capabilities and are rewarded for sophisticated planning towards a shared objective.<br/><br/>Players active regiments via random chit pull, maneuvering battalions on the board. The inactive player can interrupt the active player's maneuvers unleashing lead during their advance. The limits of historical doctrine &amp; command resulting in stacking/firing limits accurately reflect unit frontages and individual unit initiative. Events dropped into the activation pool can realistically dramatically change the course of the game.<br/><br/>No two games of AVC will ever be the same. The situation lends itself to a naturally competitive scenario with an adversary, but the mechanics are intuitive as to compliment solo play. Action moves quickly back and forth between the two sides, but the game also rewards careful planning. AVC recreates the excitement of the young men off to war during the guns of August with the tactical realities of early 20th century warfare without having to charge into a machine gun nest in the open.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Play &ndash; 7 out of 10<br/>Time scale: Sixteen thirty-minute turns.<br/>Map Scale: .3 miles per hex<br/>Unit Scale: Battalion, Cavalry Squadron, Company, Batteries, Brigade HQ<br/>Players: 1 good for historical play, 2 best for competitive play.<br/>Playing Time 3-5 Hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionMorphos is a drawless connection game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsTo flip a stone means to replace it with a stone of the opposite color.<br/><br/>A vulnerable black stone is a black stone that is part of at least one of the following two patterns or their translations, rotations or reflections:<br/><br/>a) Black stone on b2 and white stones on b3, a3, a2 and b1.<br/><br/>b) Black stone on b2 and white stones on a4, a3, a2, b1 and c1.<br/><br/>Likewise, with colors reversed, for vulnerable white stones. In all cases, the colored edges of the board count as lines of stones of their respective colors, with a length equal to that of a normal row or column of the board. The status of any points outside those patterns is irrelevant.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must either place a stone of their color on an empty point of the board or flip a vulnerable enemy stone.<br/><br/>If a player has no moves available on their turn, they must pass. Passing is otherwise not allowed. There will always be a move available to at least one of the players.<br/><br/>If, at the end of a player's turn, there is a chain of orthogonally adjacent stones of their color touching the two opposite board edges of their color, that player wins. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on his first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariantsThe following mutators can be used (together or separately) to alter the character of the game:<br/><br/>a) Both vulnerability patterns have the stone in the top left corner removed from them. This results in a game reminiscent of Crossway, but somewhat slower and free of illegal moves on empty points. All other mutators on this list work best when combined with this one.<br/><br/>b) A stone that was flipped by the enemy on their latest turn still counts as a friendly stone for flipping purposes. In this case, the winning condition must be checked for a player at the start of their turn instead of at the end of it, and it's illegal to flip a stone if the opponent could flip it back on their next turn.<br/><br/>c) On their turn, a player must either place up to two stones of their color on empty points or flip one vulnerable enemy stone.<br/><br/>d) When a player captures (flips) a stone and there are empty points on the board, the captured stone is placed next to the board, and the opponent must place it on an empty point of the board before making a regular move.<br/><br/>e) Before the start of the game, the board is filled with stones forming a checkered pattern. This results in a game very similar to Metamorphosis but without draws.<br/><br/>",

The Gloop tiles are a set of 91 square tiles that show every unique way that paths can be drawn between pairs of points on each tile side.<br/><br/>Players start by randomly drawing six tiles into their hand, and placing a pair of matching tiles in the centre. Players then take turns either: 1) forming tiles from their hand into matching 2x2 patterns, 2) matching one of their 2x2 patterns with the central pattern, or 3) drawing a random tile into their hand. The game is won by the player who has no remaining tiles.<br/><br/>The Gloop tiles also allow a number of interesting puzzles, such as finding the greatest number of tiles that pack to form a single closed path, packing all 91 tiles into a 7x13 rectangle with the smallest or greatest number of paths, etc.<br/><br/>",

Whoever makes the most money (scores the most points) before the deck runs out wins!<br/><br/>Farm &amp; Factories is a card game where you use a combination of Building cards and Action cards to accumulate victory points or disrupt your opponents quest for victory points.<br/><br/>Each person starts with a hand of four cards in the first round. First you will draw a card from the deck then play one card. An Action card will allow you to take an immediate action, such as the Research card, &quot;Draw three cards,&quot; or the Boycott card, &quot;Choose an opponent: that player skips his or her next score phase.&quot; Once an action is complete you add the action card to your point pile. A Building card performs no immediate action, but will allow you to take prescribed actions on every subsequent turn. You may have as many buildings as you would like, but you only have three workers each turn to activate buildings. <br/>Each subsequent round has four phases per each player turn: Worker Phase (choosing which buildings are active that turn), Score Phase (score cards as dictated by your active buildings), Draw Phase (draw your one card and any others dictated by your Building cards), and the Play Phase (play one card from your hand and any other plays as dictated by your active buildings.)<br/> Scoring is done by following the actions on the Action and Building cards to build your score pile. Each card is assigned a victory point amount from 1-3. Once the deck runs out each player counts the points in his/her score pile and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The USN must successfully tighten the blockade to the extent that the Confederacy has lost its ability to support the war effort economically; the CSN must attempt to keep the major ports of the Confederacy open, hoping to force the USN to concede that the blockade effort and the overall waterborne campaign has been a failure. This is accomplished practically by the USN shutting down two of three major operational areas (the Gulf, Mississippi, or Tidewater Ports) before the end of 1864, the Confederacy preventing this, or one side exhausting the other by reducing their available draw deck to zero cards.<br/><br/>The two players make use of a number of historical warships, personalities, strategies, and events. The USN has a large economy and the advantage of plentiful shipyards with which to strengthen its war machine; the Confederacy must rely upon a variety of unconventional strategies and the management of a largely reactive defense while watching their resources diminish over the course of the war.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction:<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Berd&rdquo; is an ancient word that stands for a fortress or prison. The goal of the game is to collect the most tokens of any color by the end of the game. Playing pieces in the Berd game have ability to attach/detach to each other. That allows players to move a stack of tokens like a single unit and split the structure when needed. Using interlocking blocks players can create towers and a certain type of tower - Berd has unique properties that make this game special.<br/><br/>The design of the game is specially made simple underlying an easy and logical concept of the game. However the Berd is a serious game and players have to think strategically to win. Also, the board without a theme allows to play many different Berd games.<br/><br/>The board of the Berd game has a shape of a square castle from top view. In fact the starting/finishing corner squares were designed larger for accommodating four stacks of tokens.<br/><br/>Berd is the only game that offers options of the abstract strategy game; strategy game with dice; trading game; team game and combinations of all the above.<br/><br/>Berd game can be setup in few seconds. Duration of any option of the Berd game depends on how many tokens are played. So players can set up a rapid game of 10 minutes or a long game of 90 minutes. The Berd game for two players may last less than 5 minutes.<br/><br/>Berd game can be adjusted for luck and strategy. By employing more tokens in the game it becomes heavier in strategy.<br/><br/>Berd game perfectly fits for tournaments because players can accumulate tokens (or points) in series of games with different players.<br/><br/>The interlocking blocks in the &ldquo;Berd&rdquo; game are made of high quality ABS plastic with thick walls, so they can last forever without wearing and breaking.<br/><br/>The Berd game is ideal for educating children, especially when using value assigned tokens. The game can also help developing strategic thinking.<br/><br/>The Berd game was granted U.S. utility Patent#9962603B2<br/><br/>&quot;Berd&quot; is a registered trademark.<br/><br/>Game setting<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game players choose color of tokens they will play. All players will get equal number of tokens. Then players throw one die for determining who will select the starting/finishing corner the first. The highest scored player will select his/her starting corner the first. Other players will follow in descending order placing stack of their tokens on any starting corner they want. Players can start from the same corner. The highest scored player will start the game following by other players in clockwise direction.<br/><br/>Some definitions:<br/><br/>1. Tower &ndash; a stack of 2 or more tokens (any color). The color of the token on top represents who owns that tower.<br/>2. Berd &ndash; two or more tokens of the same color stacked on each other on the top of a tower. A Berd is considered a protected tower.<br/>3. UT &ndash; Unprotected Token/Tower =&gt; a single token or a tower which is not a Berd. An unprotected tower moves like a single token.<br/>4. Double &ndash; when you roll the same number on each die. In this case, you are to play the number 4 times.<br/>5. Active Token &ndash; a token is still on the board that hasn&rsquo;t been captured.  <br/>6. Inactive token &mdash; a token captured in a tower or Berd by other color token. Inactive tokens always stacked under the active tokens.<br/>7. Active Player &ndash; a player who still has active token(s).<br/>8. Recovering inactive token - a player can recover his/her inactive token(s), captured in an unprotected tower, by landing on that tower. In this case the player will create a Berd by re-stacking his/her tokens on the top.<br/><br/>Process of the game<br/><br/>Players roll a pair of dice and move UTs (unprotected tokens/towers) on the board by counting squares in the clockwise direction. You can play with one UT both scores of the dice, or play each value of the die by different UT. You must move an unprotected tower like a single unit with captured tokens attached underneath of your token. Players will capture opponent&rsquo;s UT when land on them. However, you can&rsquo;t capture a Berd and you can&rsquo;t land on a square occupied by the Berd. If you capture an unprotected tower that contains your color token(s) inside, then you will restack the whole tower and put your color tokens on the top, creating a Berd. There is no limit of capturing other tokens. However, if you create a Berd, you cannot move it whole. You have to split up your Berd and play token(s) or unprotected tower(s) from your Berd separately. If your Berd contains captured tokens, they must be attached to at least one of your tokens whether moving or staying. You can split captured tokens in any combination when splitting your Berd but they must be attached under your token(s). When you roll a double, you will play the scored points four times. That is a great advantage especially with Berd because you can move two or more tokens simultaneously, so they will remain protected. When a player finishes his/her token by reaching the starting corner, this player will collect one token from each active player. In order to finish, you don&rsquo;t have to land exactly on the corner square that you started from; you can go over. Other players should decide what color and from where to give a token to the finished player. They can give any token in their possession, whether from the board or from already finished tokens. When finishing, you only get tokens based on how many of your own color tokens finished. <br/>The game is over when only one active player remains. The winner is the player who collected the most tokens of any color. Tokens left on the board are not counted. You can just stack all your collected tokens and compare to see whose tower is taller.<br/><br/>Variations of the game<br/><br/>This game set has many game options:<br/><br/>1. Short path simple game &ndash; this is a basic Berd game played on the side of the folding board with a shorter path. This game lasts about 25 minutes (4 players x 9 tokens). The duration of the game can be shortened with fewer players and/or using fewer tokens<br/><br/>2. Long path simple game &ndash; this is a basic Berd game played on the side of folding board with a longer path. This game lasts about 40 minutes (4 players x 9 tokens)<br/><br/>3. Game with color protection &ndash; both 1 and 2 games can be played with color protection. Players can use colored squares on the board for protection from being captured by the opponents token. For example: Blue color player&rsquo;s single token or unprotected tower will be protected on the Blue square. Other players can&rsquo;t capture the Blue token on the blue square and they can&rsquo;t land on the blue square if it&rsquo;s occupied by the Blue token. The rest of the game rules are same as for the basic Berd game<br/><br/>4. Game with points &ndash; 1, 2, and 3 games can be played with points. Each color tokens have different weights/points (10; 20; 30; 40; 50; 60; 70; 80 and 90), shown on the tokens. This option of the game provides more possibilities for moves. The winner will be a player who collects highest total score. In order to play this version of the game you need to attach stickers with numbers. There are lines on the sides of the token for even attachment.<br/><br/>5. Game with hidden numbers &ndash; 1, 2, and 3 games can be played with tokens that have hidden numbers (numbers are not displayed outside, they are attached inside). This game is similar to game #4 with the difference that only the player who possesses a token can see the weight of that token. This feature introduces more intrigue and uncertainty about end result of the game. Also this version of game allows players to bet.<br/><br/>6. Berd game without dice &ndash; this game is quite different from the race game on the path. It is a two player game and played on a small two sided square board. One side has 3&times;3 squares and other side has 4&times;4 squares. The goal of the game is to collect more tokens than your opponent. At the beginning of the game players setup their tokens on base lines (the first line from each side) opposing each other. Players collect token(s) crossing the board starting from their base line and finishing - passing opponent&rsquo;s baseline.  Players move their UT (unprotected token or Unprotected tower) one square at a time forward or lateral move. You can&rsquo;t move your UT diagonally or backward. While you can move your UT laterally however you can&rsquo;t do more than three consecutive side moves. After the third consecutive side movement a player must do next move forward. After the forward move you can do side movement again. You can&rsquo;t land on a square occupied by your opponent&rsquo;s Berd. A player can recover his/her captured token(s) from opponent&rsquo;s unprotected tower by landing on that tower. In this case the player will re-stack tokens and place his/her tokens on the top creating a Berd. In order to play a token from the Berd you have to split the Berd and play a single token or unprotected tower. If there are captured tokens in the Berd they must be attached at least under one of your token. The game is over when only one player has active token(s) left on the board.  Now players can stack their collected tokens and see whose tower is taller or who collected more tokens.<br/><br/>7. Berd game without dice with color protection -this game is similar to game #3 in terms of the color protection<br/><br/>8. Berd game without dice and with points &ndash; this game is similar to game #4 in terms of number consideration<br/><br/>9. Berd game without dice with hidden numbers &ndash; this game is similar to game #5 in terms of number consideration.<br/><br/>10. Berd Team game &ndash; this game option can be played by two or more teams. Each player will play with his/her color tokens. The goal of the team to collect the most tokens (or points). Players of the same team can land on the squares occupied by teammate and stack the tokens in one tower. If there was a Berd on that square it will protect all tokens of the team. Team also can share the captured tokens. That is a great advantage for the team, since they can decide when and how many captured tokens to move. When finishing a token only rival team members will pay token(s). The game is over when only one team has active player(s).<br/><br/>11. Game with trading options: In this game players can trade captured token(s) with other players. All players will start the game with same count of tokens and some cash. The goal of the game is to accumulate the most capital (cash + value of collected tokens). Each token at the end of the game will worth certain amount of money predetermined at the beginning of the game. During the game players can redeem captured token(s) by paying cash or swapping with other token(s). The market value of the captured token will vary depending on the location on the board and a possibility to recover it. Because the captured token will have a fixed value when finished a player, who captured the token can negotiate higher price. On the other hand a player who wants to redeem his token may want to pay higher price because active tokens can potentially capture other tokens. Players can negotiate a trade only at their turn. After redemption a token must be started from the starting corner. When a player finishes a token, all other active players have to pay one token or pay cash for the finished token. Depending on the board situation each player will decide what method of payment is a better. The winner of the game will be a player who accumulates more capital =&gt; (Number of collected tokens) x Price + Cash.<br/><br/>12. Game with points and trading options: This game is similar to the Berd game#11 with one difference =&gt; when a player finishes a token other players will pay by token or pay the price indicated on the finished token. At the end of the game players calculate the total value of collected tokens + cash. The value of a token is a number/price on the sticker. The winner is a player who collected the most capital.<br/><br/>13. Game with a goal to collect certain numbers &ndash; in this game a player tries to collect some certain tokens with same number on sticker (for example tokens with number 20). If there are 4 players in the game then maximum quantity of any number will be 4. The first player who collects all 4 numbers will win the game. If the game finished earlier then the winner is a player who collected the most of the specified number tokens. In this game players follow same Berd playing concept but for the finished token other players don&rsquo;t pay tokens. Also players are not required to finish their tokens when passing their start/finish corner, - they can continue playing these tokens.<br/>       <br/>All the above game variations can be played with different quantity of tokens. The more tokens employed in the game the heavier it will be in strategy.<br/><br/>",

Romantics want to preserve the old quarters of bourgeois ambitions using the dissatisfaction of the people of Paris and inspiring them with revolutionary ideas.<br/><br/>Paris 1800' is an assymetrical game in which the objective is to have more victory points at the end of play (1910) or reach 20 VP at any moment. <br/>In each round the players: <br/>1 : collect Resources (Inspiration points or Millions of francs)<br/>2 : move character(s), according to the Observatory<br/>3 : perform an action (one per character)<br/><br/>The Romantics score by making Revolutions, finding and stopping the Engineer from transforming districts and writing in Exile. They can also trigger Unrest in the districts (Discontent and Revolt), get inspiration in the Forest and  liberate a Romantic from the Fort.<br/><br/>Moderns score by transforming Faubourgs, Ville and Cit&eacute; districts. Their actions are draw Projects, obtain/change Permit, Restore order and Imprison a Romantic.<br/><br/>Both camps are able to open/close the newspaper and to change the movement order in the Observatory.<br/><br/>Bribe: When a Prefect tries to put a Romantic in the Fort, he can use one a Bribe marker to avoid being locked up, but the Moderns immediately gain 2 million francs.<br/><br/>Calculation and treason cards: only valid in a three-player situation.<br/><br/>Each player draws two &quot;Calculation and Treason&quot; cards. Between 1825 and 1850, at any moment, every player secretly holds one card in hand. From 1850, if a player is a renegade, he will have to discreetly help the other camp.<br/><br/>After 1850 loyal players can denounce a suspected renegade. If the player is indeed a renegade, he stops play and joins the other camp (the game is still a 3v3 pawns). If he's not a renegade, the camp loses immediately 5 VP.<br/><br/>",

There are three types of cards: 18 Reporter cards (2 each of an English, French and German reporter with corresponding camera and transport cards); 18 Story cards (color-coded red, blue and orange, each with 2 Event cards, 2 Place cards and 2 Interviewee cards); and 18 Document cards (red, blue and orange, each numbered 1-6).<br/><br/>Players collect combinations of sets, each of which can be a Reporter with matching equipment, the Event, Place and Interviewee of a color, or three consecutive Document cards of the same color.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 2,700 in tokens and a hand of 8 cards, and each turn draws a card and discards a card. The other players in turn order have an opportunity to buy the discard if they can use it to complete a set of three, paying 20 into the pot if they do so. Other players may overbid if eligible, paying 40, 60, etc. If the discard is not claimed, play passes to the left; if it is claimed, play passes to the claimer's left.<br/><br/>A hand is won when a player completes his hand with one of 7 combinations of sets. The winner takes the pot plus a score that varies with the difficulty of the combination, from 500 for two series of Reporters and one of Stories to 5,000 for three series of different Reporters. Winner of the game is first to 20,000 points.<br/><br/>The game box features celebrated French journalist Georges de Caunes. The artwork suggests it dates to the 1960s.<br/><br/>",

Starship Crewpers engenders the experience of crewing a starship while undertaking missions that will fundamentally effect the plot of an ongoing galactic saga.<br/><br/>In a galaxy where every culture depends upon the Situdel Parliament to maintain the flow of species-specific food, life has been relatively unruffled for centuries. Now, from unknown interstellar origin, comes the galaxy&rsquo;s first contact with alien life and it is hostile. One solar system has nearly been eradicated and all attempts to communicate with the invaders have proven fruitless.<br/><br/>With the Situdel Fleet allocating the majority of its resources to defending the population on the war front, you will begin your Fleet deployment by taking your small ship on patrol around a remote sector of space. Support from the central government and the rest of the Fleet is thin so you and your crew will be responsible for maintaining order in the region.<br/><br/>This worker placement and polyomino puzzle game has players drawing custom crew meeples from a shared bag to deploy them into custom polyomino tiles. The polyominos - or meepleOminos, if you will - must then be maneuvered across you starship board triggering worker placement slots as they pass over them. Play cards from hand to activate special effects such as repairing your ship, relieving stress and injuries from the crew and manipulating the polyomino tiles to maximize their scoring when they eventually get placed onto the mission grid for victory points.<br/><br/>",

The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/>Black plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, place a stone of your color on an empty point or remove a stone from an enemy weak pair. A weak pair is a pair of like-colored, diagonally adjacent stones with no like-colored stone orthogonally adjacent to both.<br/><br/>You must not place a stone where your opponent just removed a stone from or remove a stone your opponent just placed. Also, you must not remove a stone if either player removed any stone on their single latest turn. Passing is not allowed, but, if you have no legal moves available, your turn is skipped.<br/><br/>You win if there is a chain of orthogonally connected stones of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color.<br/><br/>If a board position is repeated with the same player to move, the game ends in a draw. This can happen in certain positions with a board full of stones, but no position is known where creating a repetition is the optimal course of play.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>",

You'll be establishing your stills, paddocks and businesses, making, moving and selling moonshine, hiring Bootleggers to defend your turf, raiding other player's properties for their goods and trying to keep one step ahead of the Feds. You'll make fast friends to take down stronger players, but beware... those allies you have just made will always have schemes and machinations of their own.<br/><br/>Game-Play:<br/>Turns go quickly around the table, with each player able to take one action. <br/>Players can choose to build paddocks, stills and businesses (placing these cards in their &quot;Property&quot; playspace), roll a dice to make or sell moonshine (Results of 1 mean a still blows up, or the Feds appear!), steal any building from another player's Property, hire bootleggers to defend their own Property, or even Tip Off the Feds to disrupt a rival's moonshine operation.<br/><br/>Creating an efficient production line for your moonshine operation, defending your property, temporarily allying with other players to cut another rival down to size, and choosing the right moment to sell or strike are keys to success in Still in Business.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/>The ultimate goal is to sell 5 moonshine. Whether you make this yourself, or steal from other players before sale, is entirely up to you and your real-life sense of morality (or lack thereof!)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "August 1994 - Making their premier at GenCon '94 in clear plastic packages, not that which we know them in today.  Many new concepts were brought in this set.  First and most obvious, Ravenloft became the 4th world to formally join Spellfire.  This Set also gave us the first werebeasts (Loup Garou, Sir Heirgaard, etc) and the first real undead (sorry, but 4 allies and one champion from the first Edition set don't qualify to me).  Also, some new game concepts came up.  First, we got the concept of Limbo from two cards (Strahd Von Zarovich [#100] and Ring of Reversion [#63]).  Also, this set gave us the first arguement that created the Order of Activation (The question, if you care, was that of Midnight, Goddess of Magic vs. the Ring of Reversion).  Finally, we had one more type of new card: The Rule Card.  There were only 3, but rule cards are such a core concept now, it's wierd to think of not having them.  Also, this is the only set printed to date that was not printed with chase of any sort.  Landmark Cards: Dementilieu (#11); Quirk of Fate (#26); City States (#30); Conjure Grave Elemental (#35); Tarokka Deck (#56); Ring of Reversion (#63); Flesh Golems (#73); Loup Garou (#79); Headless Horseman (#88); and Strahd Von Zarovich (#100).<br/><br/>",

Instead, it took the under developed concepts in the game, and expanded to make it playable with inventive powers.  Artifacts were made for many worlds that had few, rule cards had a rarity less than full rares, we found holdings for any world, all champions got better powers, and Dark Sun finally had enough realms to be a viable theme.  This was also the first of two sets that had only 20 chase instead of 25.  However, it was also a set that started using only 1 rare per pack.  Landmark Cards: Wand of Orcus (#1); Obsidian Man of Urik (#14); Rod of 7 Parts (#21-27); Bag of Holding (#28); Temporal Stasis (#53); Deflection (#54); Korgunard the Avangion (#75); Drawmij (#85); Ur Draxa (#91); Anchient Kalidnay (#92); Onad the Weasel (c#6); Young Strahd (c#8); Amulet of Spell Protection (c#17); and the Dragon Font (c#20).<br/><br/>",

The decks are tuned to represent the distinct personalities and traits of their leader characters - some are fast and hard hitting, some are sly and resourceful, others chaotic and insane.<br/><br/>You choose two characters for you SKIRMISH and combine their decks. Then it's time to face off against your opponent.<br/><br/>The table itself is divided into three zones - a central lane with two flanking areas - and where you deploy has a huge impact on on the success of your strategy.<br/><br/>Flanking attacks, reinforcement blocks, long range equipment, area denial continuous effects - the varying zones give you the option to attack, retreat, consolidate, or redistribute your forces.<br/><br/>Whereas Magic resource generation is random, and Hearthstone has a rigid scaling in place, SKIRMISH as a more flat resource system that creates brisk, deep gameplay.<br/><br/>Each character generates REsolve that they can use to play followers, items, actions, and events. But be cautions about deploying it all at once - just like the tactical regions on the table, managing your Resolve with cold efficiency can be the key difference between victory and defeat. And if a character dies, their Resolve goes with them.<br/><br/>",

Players may opt unanimously at the end of a short or standard campaign to continue the game to the next campaign level if desired. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>Dealer: Either roll high (d12) or If playing a series of games, the winner of the last game is the dealer for initial set-up and the first round of play. The dealer in rounds 2 thru 9 changes to the player with the lowest total casualty points (score).

Royal Decree Phase:  Player may choose to play a Monarch Card using the card&rsquo;s Royal Decree.  The Royal Decree invokes any one Revealed Battlefield Event that the player chooses; if the Monarch card is played in this manner it is placed in the Discard pile and removed from play for the remainder of the round. There is no limit to the number of Monarch Cards that can be played during the players Royal Decree Phase using the Monarch Royal Decree.

After the faction change effect is resolved the rank value Emissary card is zero (0) for the next players turn.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     - The player may play a Monarch card as a Faction card from their hand on top of the card in the Battlefield. If the Monarch card either matches the faction or rank of the card in the Battlefield, continue on to the Battlefield Result Phase.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     - The player may play a Minion card as a Faction card from their hand on top of the card in the Battlefield. If the Minion card either matches the faction or rank of the card in the Battlefield, continue on to the Battlefield Result Phase.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     - The player may play a Minion card that matches the Rank of the Battlefield Event Wildcard that invokes any one of the Revealed! Battlefield Event that the player chooses. Resolve the Battlefield Event, and continue on to the Battlefield Result Phase.<br/><br/><br/>3.

Pass Phase:  (end of players turn) If the player does not or cannot play a card onto the Battlefield, the player passes and play moves on to the next left (clockwise) player.<br/><br/>5.

And even crazy investors know that the way to make money is to identify a problem and solve it. The good news is that you have been hearing a lot lately about a problem that needs solving. The bad news is that you have no idea how to solve it. That is why you have gathered a think tank of innovators together (yes, these are the other players).<br/><br/>Choose one card from each pile to reveal the problem. Now that everyone knows what the problem is, it is up to the innovators to figure out why it exists and how to fix it.<br/><br/>In two minutes or less, each Innovator must draw a prototype for a new, creative product to solve the problem &ndash; without using words. When time is up, they will give you the prototypes to review.<br/><br/>Choose two that you would like to learn more about. The Innovators that drew them get a chance to &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; their product to you.  After hearing the pitches, choose one product to invest in. The Innovator who came up with the product wins the round. Hooray! Give them in investment chip so they can keep track of how many rounds they win &ndash; because it matters.<br/><br/>Now, it is the player to your left&rsquo;s turn to the be the Investor and you are the Innovator. And so on. The person who wins has the most investment tokens when you&rsquo;re tired of playing is the Innovator of the Year. Yes, they should totally put that on their resume!<br/><br/>",

The rest of the players choose a combination of race and class for their Hero. Certain spellcasting classes also get a deck of spell cards, unique to that class. The players team up to defeat the evil monsters of the Abyss, achieve the Quest goal, and find the exit to the map (typically leading to the start of the next Quest).<br/><br/>On each turn, a Hero may take an Action then move, or move then take an Action. An &quot;Action&quot; is one of nine possibilities: Attack, Cast a Spell, Search for Treasure, Search for Secret Doors, Search for Traps, Disarm a Trap, Use an Active Skill, Use a Special Action, Switch Items.<br/><br/>Movement around the map each turn takes 1d6+4 squares. Attacking, defending, and some other actions are performed with pictographic Combat Dice.<br/><br/>The Heroes lose the Quest if they fail to achieve the Quest objective, or if all Heroes are killed before they find the exit to the map.<br/><br/>",

Dungeons always include 3 boss monsters and a random selection of 12 other cards.<br/><br/>Players take turns revealing the central dungeon card. All players simultaneously play an action card and draw their hands back up. After all players have placed a card, the Action cards are revealed and effects take place. Players that are last to draw a new card always suffer a small penalty. Monsters that aren't destroyed get to fight back.<br/><br/>Loot the Body is full of fast action and split second decisions that keep everything moving and fun no matter how many times you've played before. The base game also includes some rule variants for players that want even more chaos as they fight to survive and gain loot.<br/><br/>",

Unlike the other Paint 'N' Play games, which featured a board, the Galacta series games were straight miniatures rules designed to be played directly on the tabletop.<br/><br/>The contents included metal miniature figures, paints, a brush, &quot;adventure game rules&quot;, and a 12-sided die. Heritage sold additional Galacta 25mm figures that could be used with the games.<br/><br/>",

The newly arrived 1st US Infantry Division was rushed to the front and its 28th Regiment, nicknamed the Black Lions, was ordered to retake and hold the town. Although the Americans quickly took the town from the disorganized and ill-prepared defenders, the Black Lions had to then endure days of increasingly desperate and violent counter-attacks that decimated the ranks of both sides. The outcome of the battle would be a telling indicator of America&rsquo;s new role in the Great War.<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players incarnate heroes with unique abilities, expanding the powers on their quest to collect the Tears of Power - the artefacts needed for the ritual summoning the Scroll - and become the ruler of the Sacred Lands.&quot;<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a hero (with unique powers to use through the game), a starting deck of crystals (the in-game currency), and a secret quest. Each hero has also a specific thematic and colour, corresponding to the type of crystals they use.<br/><br/>Four card stacks - one for each corresponding crystal colour - are used to get new cards. Players start only buying cards from their own crystal colour, until they gain new abilities allowing them to get cards associated with the other crystals.<br/><br/>To win the game, two Tears of Power must be collected. One is obtained by accomplishing the quest (requires a deck optimisation); the other is obtained by successfully summoning Rhaluyne the Wise (requires enough crystals and a dice roll).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

It is primarily a naval-air conflict, with some elements of power projection using ground forces. The game map represents various sea zones (or zones) within the Mediterranean, as well as adjoining land areas. Critical bases for both sides, including neutral nations are also depicted.<br/><br/>Aircraft units represent one to six squadrons, with the counter displaying the primary type of aircraft. Ship units represent one fleet aircraft carrier or battleship and &ldquo;divisions&rdquo; of four cruisers or nuclear-powered submarines with destroyers being represented in squadrons of six to eight destroyers or non-nuclear subs. Other ship types are represented at the division level and represent various numbers of ship types. On the map, each inch equals 20 miles. Each turn represents from one day to one week of activity, depending on the level of activity. Sixth Fleet is based on Red Dragon Rising. Changes have been made based on the situation in the Mediterranean during the Cold War.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rome is going to hell. Redneck barbarians are raiding the borders, the economy is in freefall, and the sewer workers are on strike...again. To top it all, mercenaries and slaves have delusions of grandeur (they want to be paid, for Jupiter's sake!), while those petty pencil pushers at the Senate indulge in never-ending rhetoric displays. As a wealthy patrician, you're pretty sure it is expected that you lend your help to Rome in this dire time of need, but then again will your &quot;friends&quot; do the same? The Ides of March are around the corner...'<br/><br/>Vae Victis is a semi-competitive game of decline and treachery for 1 to 6 Roman patricians. The phrase &quot;Vae Victis&quot; &mdash; Latin for &quot;woe to the vanquished&quot; or &quot;woe to the conquered&quot; &mdash; suggests that those defeated in battle are entirely at the mercy of their conquerors and should neither expect nor request leniency. Keep that spirit in mind when playing this game. Players take turns alternatively, and on their turn, they must go through three phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Doom phase: The player rolls the three doom dice, eliminates one of them, then applies the result of the remaining two dice.<br/>     Support phase: The player can take up to two actions in any combination in the action spots LIMITES, AERARIUM, or DOMUS PALATINA, possibly pushing their luck!<br/>     Influence phase: The player can take up to two actions in any combination in the action spots THERMAE, FORUM, or CURIA.<br/><br/><br/>After this, play passes to the next player. Play continues until a winning condition is met, with the conditions being as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    All players lose if one of the wars is lost or one of the tracks reaches the final space. No player can decide to lose a war or make a track reach its final space if they can avoid it &mdash; unless they are the traitor (see below).<br/>    A player loses at the end of any turn if they've run out of coins.<br/>    A player wins at the end of their turn if they simultaneously fulfill the requirement of their goal card &quot;SENATE&quot; and their goal card &quot;WAR&quot;.<br/>    A player wins at the end of any turn if all other players have lost.<br/><br/><br/>Note that any player can be a traitor to Rome, and they win if a condition is met that results in all players losing the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Early colonization efforts of Mars have been successful. With dozens of outposts scattered across the surface, a new challenge awaits: providing infrastructure to the red planet and moving goods to where they are needed most (while making a tidy profit of course). Fortunately the abundance of precious metals will help with this task by allowing upgrades to the transport vessels over time.<br/><br/>Tracks on Mars is a light-weight family crayon rail game. It has been designed specifically for two players. Drawing the tracks, loading goods onto the pawns, and over sized dice all work together to make this a very tactile experience. Luck is a major factor but can be mitigated by re-rolls and catch-up mechanics. On a strategic level, players have to balance network building, transportation, and equipment upgrades.<br/><br/>The core mechanics are Yahtzee-style dice rolling and resource allocation. Matching dice rolls are converted to currency which is then used to either claim new routes or move the player's pawns to pick up and deliver goods. Victory points are ultimately  scored depending on the distance that goods have been transported. Players have to decide whether they want to make multiple short runs for few VPs or spend turns building a long route for fewer high value transports.<br/><br/>This is a print &amp; play title comprised of five dice, 40 resource cubes, currency token cards, an 18&quot; x 18&quot; board, and four 3D printed pawns.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Districts: Barcelona is a game for up to 4 players about the different interests and tensions that transforms a city over time and how they are related. The City works as an ecosystem and its citizens try to adapt and transform it to match their needs. Sometimes, such changes come as a by product of some direct actions, some other times it comes from direct developments that come through the administration or private investments.<br/><br/>We assess that it&rsquo;s not possible to witness such changes and transformations as a neutral witness: everyone is biased by its own experiences and perspective. Due to that, we have developed the different factions as how they perceive themselves. That is, portraying each of them per their own self-defined virtues and what they consider works best for most of the citizens, when not for everyone. Of course, as after all this is a game, for the sake of game balance we have adjusted certain values and actions to provide a better playability.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 4 players (but rules are provided for 3 and 2 players) and the city map is divided in districts. Each district has an array of values that describe its economic and population statistics. These values are a common pool for all the players, this means that your actions deplete some values to increase others, but doing so you might enable a 2nd player to play its actions in that district.<br/><br/>The game has no luck component whatsoever, players' actions have a basic effect no matter where they play them, and an additional effect if certain values are matched. Each faction consumes certain resources and generate others, and not a single faction is autonomous: each of them requires at least one resource they can not generate.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bleaktrick is a trick-taking game for 3 or 4 players that can be played with a standard deck of playing cards. 40 cards are used: Aces to 10's in each of the four suits. At the start of each round, 36 of the 40 cards are dealt equally to the players and each player exchange one card face-down with both of its neighbors. In a 3-player game, each player also discards a card from his hand.<br/><br/>The dealer leads the first trick and play proceed clockwise until all cards are played. Normal rules for trick-taking games apply: players must follow suit, otherwise they can play any card and the highest card of the leading suit wins the trick (there is no trump suit). When a player wins a trick,<br/>he takes only the card that won the trick (the rest of the trick is discarded), puts it in his winning pile and leads the next trick.<br/><br/>The twist in Bleacktrick game is this: Every time a player takes a trick with a card of equal or lower value than a certain threshold, then this card becomes the &quot;bleak&quot; card. The starting value of the threshold is 7 but it changes each time to match the value of the last &quot;bleak&quot; card. There's an exception though: if you are already the &quot;bleak&quot; card owner, you can win tricks with cards of smaller value without lowering the threshold. The goal of the game is to score the most points without ending up with the &quot;bleak&quot; card in your possession.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each player scores points according to the cards in his winning pile, except from the &quot;bleak&quot; card owner who scores negative points. The lower the numerical value of a card, the more points it scores (for both the positive and the negative case). So, it's preferable to win tricks with low value cards but also more risky as you may end up with the &quot;bleak&quot; card. The player who won the last trick is the dealer for the next round, while the owner of the &quot;bleak&quot; card can have a peek at 2 of the 4 unused cards of the next round. The game ends after a prearranged number of rounds or when a player reaches a prearranged number of points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Set the deck face down between all participants. The player left of the dealer takes the first turn.<br/><br/>For each turn, a player draws up to the hand limit of 7 cards [from any combination of atop the deck or discard field), and discards 1 card into an open field of cards on the playing surface (concluding the turn). If, prior to discarding, a player matches a &quot;Potion&quot; card with the 2 &quot;Ingredient&quot; cards shown on it, the 3 cards may be played on any opponent's Life card. When this occurs, set aside all 4 cards to remove them from play. If one loses all life cards, he or she is dead and out of the game. A player may attack only once per turn, and only the Life form targeted by a potion. &quot;Secret Ingredient&quot; cards are wild. Use them in place of ingredients needed to mix a potion. The &quot;Serum X&quot; card is a complete potion that, by itself, may attack any Life form.<br/><br/>The sole surviving player, wins!<br/><br/>",

You want to become the true abstractionist of this era. At the same time your limited resources and lack of supplies hinders your goal, your work and pursuit of fame and status.<br/><br/>The goal is to make color placements and color combinations in such a way that you end up with the highest score in the end. Every color added to the canvas is a potential scoring opportunity that will move the scoretrack pawn one or several (1-4) steps. If at any point during the game a player reaches the score of twenty (20) points or above, the Endgame Exhibition is triggered and the final scoring begins.  Some color tile combinations scores extra during the scoring and you could score points for your chosen favorite color as long as no one else chosen the same.<br/><br/>",

This is a stand alone game for solitaire and two-players and is fully compatible with the other Panzer Orders games and expansions.<br/><br/>The game is quick to setup and play, it takes around 30 minutes to play a game and comes complete with everything you need. Each card has a points value based on the card characteristics and special rules. The players agree a point based battle and then build their decks, spending points on specific cards.<br/><br/>Each player must form three columns of any mixture of vehicles, tanks, or infantry and then attack the opponents columns. The first player to defeat all three columns or force the opposing player to draw their last card, wins the game. During the player turn you can choose to dig and defend with your card, moves cards from one column to another or attack with ling range or close combat. Non of these are without their risks and weighing up the risk vs the strategic gain is part of the decision making elements of the game.<br/><br/>Combat is fast, simple but very brutal with all the dice rolls required on the cards - no charts or looking up in the rules. Damaged cards are suppressed first before being removed from the game and can still make a free saving throw on the dice to keep in the fight.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to get the least amount of points by the end of the game. There are 6 fazes, each with its own set of rules. The last faze called &ldquo;madness&rdquo; combines all of the rules from previous fazes. Fazes is a fun and challenging card game for all skill levels.<br/><br/>Starting Fazes<br/>Each player is dealt an equal amount of cards. The player with the green 2 begins play in each faze by leading with that card. Play continues in a clockwise direction. Players must play the color that is led. After everyone has played a card, the highest numeric card of the color played will take the hand.<br/><br/>Trump<br/>Players who are out of the color led will have to play a trump card if they have it.  Red cards are TRUMP in fazes 1 &amp; 6 and when a red card is played it wins the trick. For example, if a player leads with a yellow card and the next player is out of yellow, they have to play a red card, if they have it, which trumps the trick. If two or more players have to trump any trick, the highest numeric red trump card wins the trick.<br/><br/>Faze 1 : Red Trump<br/>Each red card is worth 5 points. If a player is out of the color that is led and they have a red card, they must play it, which trumps the trick. Once all of the tricks are won, count up each red card, and write down your points. Shuffle and deal all the cards for faze 2.<br/><br/>Faze 2: Tricks &lsquo;R Pointr<br/>Each trick  worth  10  points. Trump  is  not  active  in  this  faze.  The  highest  numeric  card  of  the color  led  wins  the  trick  and  10  points.<br/><br/>Faze  3: Yellow Pointers<br/>Each  yellow  card  is  worth  10  points. Trump  is  not  active  in this  faze.  The  highest  numeric  card  of the color  led  wins the trick. Each yellow card in the  trick  is worth  10  points.<br/><br/>Faze  4: 13&rsquo;s<br/>The  #13  in  each  color  is  worth  25  points. Trump  is  not  active  in  this  faze. The  highest  numeric  card  of  the  color  led  wins  the  trick.<br/><br/>Faze  5: Last Trick<br/>The  person  who  wins  the  &ldquo;last  trick&rdquo; get&rsquo;s 50 points deducted from their score.<br/><br/>Faze  6: Madness<br/>Each  objective  and  rules  of  fazes  1  -&shy;‐  5  are  in  play!    Red  cards  (5  points  each)  are  trump  and have  to  be  used  if you don&rsquo;t have the card that is led.    Every  trick  is  worth  10  points  plus  the  value  of  pointer  cards  that  could  be  included  in  the  trick.  Yellow  cards  are  10  points  each.  The  13&rsquo;s  are  25  points  each.    Special  note  -&shy;‐  the  red  13  is  worth  30  points  (5  points  for  being  red,  25  points  for  being  a  13).  The  yellow  13  is  worth  35  points  (10  points  for  being  yellow,  25  points  for  being  a  13).  And  finally,  whoever  wins  the  last  trick  get&rsquo;s minus  50  points  from  their  score! The  player  winning  the  last  trick  must  still  account  for  any  points  within  the  trick  itself.<br/><br/>SHOOT    THE    MOON<br/>If  a  player  wins  all  of  the  points  in  any  faze  they  have &ldquo;Shot  the  Moon!&rdquo;  The  reward  for<br/>&ldquo;Shooting  the  Moon&rdquo; is  all  other  players  receive  the  total  points  of  that  faze! For  example,  if  a  player  in  faze  4  receives  all  four  13&rsquo;s,  then  all  other  players  have  100  pts added  to  their  score!<br/><br/>The object of the game is to have the lowest score at the end of all 6 Fazes.<br/><br/>",

Their skylines are growing with buildings so tall they appear to touch the sky - skyscrapers!  Players act as building companies in these different cities, trying to build up their own city's skyline to be the best and most diverse.<br/><br/>Each player is building a skyline of skyscrapers using cards from a standard 54-card deck.  On their turn, players have three options: Draft cards into their hands; Play cards to their tableau (their &quot;skyline&quot;), or Pass (for the rest of the game).  Cards played must follow certain rules, and only optimal placement will net players the most points!<br/><br/>The game ends once all players have passed (usually after the draw deck has run out and player have no more cards in-hand to play).  Players then earn points for tallest towers, widest skyline, most towers, and any mid-game bonuses they achieved, but lose points for any cards left in hand, or face-down &quot;City Street&quot; cards they played.  After totalling up all scores, most points is the winner!<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to complete the story, all the while surviving the zombie horde.<br/><br/>Each turn, three cards that may be zombies or humans are drawn and lined up face down against the barricades. The scout then looks at 1&ndash;3 of these cards, telling the fighter a limited amount of information. The fighter then decides to either attack the current horde by placing weapon cards on the different columns of enemies, or to defend, strengthening the barricades and pilfering for more weapons.<br/><br/>The scout's cards on hand are various scenarios, with fulfillment conditions. Whenever these are fulfilled, they are played, and the scout draws a new card to hand. The scenario cards get harder and harder to fulfill, and when the team has fulfilled six of these, the game ends in victory.<br/><br/>",

Things were just simpler it seemed. Now you can relive that nostalgia all over again in RB8 Retro Baseball 8-bit the Board Game.<br/><br/>RB8 is a real Baseball Simulation brought to you in the retro look of a classic 8-bit experience. Play with one of the 16 complete teams out of the box or draft and build your team based on a point value player system with custom player cards. Will you build your team with big sluggers, dominant pitching, tough defenders, speedsters, or a well-balanced machine? The choice is yours as you get to manage and make the strategic choices.<br/><br/>RB8 features a custom draw deck called Rally Cards with random events that happen during a baseball game, as the team manager you must decide when to strategically use them. You have full control of your team. Make the big manager decisions that can influence the game.<br/>RB8 also features player cards with ratings and special abilities, two six-sided dice, special custom pitcher and batter control dice, baseball field board, batter and runner markers, scoreboard with markers, and your dice key cards.<br/><br/>RB8 Retro Baseball is Played over the course of 9 innings in a single game or a best of series. On a turn both Pitcher and Batter will compare their ratings factoring in any special abilities and roll off to see who will get control of the at bat. This is called the &ldquo;On Deck Phase&rdquo;. Whoever rolls higher factoring in all special abilities will try to maintain control by rolling their custom Pitcher or Batter die. If they maintain control they will then roll dice and compare the result with their respective key to find out the results of the at bat. Players can also decide to play Rally Cards which could also affect the outcome of the play.<br/> Whether you&rsquo;re a fan of baseball, board games, or both you&rsquo;re going to love the feel and excitement of reliving the good old days in RB8 Retro Baseball!<br/><br/>Will you have what it takes to manage your team to victory?<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The rules can be learned within a couple of turns and still keep the flavor of the period.<br/><br/>What separates Fistful of Lead from most tabletop miniature games on the market, is the unique card driven turn mechanism. This leads to snap decisions and tense moments where all the players are involved.<br/><br/>For Fistful of Lead, we wanted the play to be fast and furious, with a Hollywood flair to it. For that reason, record keeping is kept to a bare minimum.<br/><br/>In most games, each player can control up to 5-6 miniatures without much trouble. Games can have up to 8 players without slowing down the game. Now, you can try out different periods within the Horse and Musket era without spending a ton of money.<br/><br/>Experienced wargamers and new players alike will enjoy this game. It's perfect for convention games and just one on one skirmishes.<br/><br/>To play Fistful of Lead: Horse &amp; Musket you&rsquo;ll need: this rule book (or, after a few games just the Quick Reference sheet), several 10-sided-dice, an ordinary deck of playing cards, a place to play, a measuring tape, and the miniatures representing your favorite troops. Markers to represent whether your models are Wounded or need to Reload can be found in this rule book.<br/><br/>Eight-sided and 12-sided dice may also be needed for some of the advanced optional rules.<br/><br/>Fistful of Lead: Horse &amp; Musket was written with 28mm figures in mind, but you can easily use models ranging from 15mm to 54mm without any changes.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rack Patrol is a solitaire, tactical-level, card-driven submarine war game. You take on the the command role of a single Gato-class submarine during WWII, on the hunt for Japanese targets in the Pacific.<br/><br/>The game is entirely card-driven. The operation cards are held in your hand or set on the table as a draw deck. You will be instructed frequently to draw a card from the operation deck in order to determine the outcome of a given action or to gain other information. You earn victory points at the end of a patrol based on the ships you have sunk during that patrol.<br/><br/>A single patrol (round) only takes about 10 minutes to play. However, due to the round/patrol-based structure, and because every patrol is an independent session of play, you can easily play longer, campaign-style games across multiple sittings. The game can be entirely packed up and put away between patrols. Simply record your running score at the end of any patrol and resume the game later.<br/><br/>There are many great submarine games out there already; what makes Rack Patrol unique is its size and portability. The entire game is played with a single deck of cards and one small player board. It takes up extremely little surface space. In fact, you could play the whole game while laying in your rack, whether that means you're aboard a submarine, or your sleeping partner already rolled over and knocked out, and you still want to get some gaming in.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dark Side of the Mine takes place in the near future, where mining corporations compete to extract resources from nearby asteroids. Order your mining robots to secure the richest mineral deposits and score more points than your competition before the asteroid deck runs out.<br/><br/>In Dark Side of the Mine, a series of cards are laid out to represent the asteroid. A certain number of cards are placed face down (depending on the number of players), representing the area where players cannot send a communication signal to their robots -- the dark side. Each turn, players flip over the left-most face down card to reveal a new mineral deposit. They will then issue orders to their robots, draw a card, and, finally, place a card from their hand face down on top of the right-most face down card.  This represents the dark side moving as the players orbit the asteroid. Slower robots may get trapped on the dark side of the asteroid, lose contact with the company so they cannot receive orders, and must wait until the dark side passes by so communication can be restored.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they have two out of four actions to perform:<br/><br/><br/>     Prospect - play a card and order the mining robot to secure the next mineral deposit of that type moving clockwise;<br/>     Upgrade - play a card and permanently increase the mining capabilities of the robots;<br/>     Communicate - Move counter-clockwise around the asteroid until you find another robot and share information with them about the asteroid;  <br/>     Recharge - Draw a new card into your hand.<br/><br/><br/>Dark Side of the Mine is a deep strategy game in a small package.  Every card can be used for multiple purposes, whether to prospect the next mineral deposit, mine that deposit, upgrade your robots, or take advantage of the work other companies have done. Careful hand management and planning will ensure that you are the most successful mining corporation in the galaxy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Entanglement is inspired by the Entanglement browser game by Gopherwood Studios.<br/><br/>Entanglement:<br/><br/>Place tiles to create the longest path possible in the game of Entanglement!<br/><br/>Create an elaborate garden labyrinth by placing one tile at a time, connecting a meandering path of twists and turns. How far can your path go? You'll have to see for yourself!<br/><br/>You're creating a spacious garden surrounded by Sakura trees, but you have a limited number of tiles to play. Create a longer path and a larger garden by winding through Sakura trees: each pass acquires additional tiles for your expanding garden.<br/><br/>Should you risk your limited tiles to set up a valuable move, divert your opponents' paths away from the Sakura trees, or focus on an easy path through another Sakura tree? Weighing what to pursue when provides a mental challenge for those who hope to master it.<br/><br/>How is it different than the web game?<br/><br/>A few game rules deliberately changed to fit better for table play, but all the components are there if you really just want to experience a real-life version of the digital game. Here are the major changes:<br/>The board game focuses on the limited-tile play of the Sakura-flavored Entanglement maps, not the boundary-based maps of classic Entanglement. This change makes initial setup much easier and prevents pre-placed tiles from shifting off-grid when they're not adjacent to other tiles.<br/>Sakura tiles are dealt into players' hands instead of being pre-placed on the board. (This is for the same reason given in #1, and also adds a little more strategy and variety.)<br/>Scoring is based on the total length of completed lines instead of on the length of individual moves. This change helps the game move a bit faster, since tallying scores like the web game isn't terribly fun to do manually.<br/>The lines are thicker, and they don't glow. The thin lines were confusing to follow visually, and I didn't want the game to be radioactive.<br/><br/>Components: Box; 72 Hex Tiles; Rules Document; 6 (different colored) Pawns<br/><br/>",

Back when the land was not ruled by kings and queens, neither structured armies with bishops, knights and rooks existed. The world was unexplored and amorphous and it had not been squeezed yet into the rigid cast of the contemporary chessboard. There were just 2 proud tribes constantly struggling to expand their territories to ensure survival in a barren and harsh land. And those who today we (somewhat degradingly) call &quot;pawns,&quot; were free entities with dreams, fears and hopes who defined their own destiny.<br/><br/>The game is played with 32 light- (&lsquo;white&rsquo;) and 32 dark-colored (&lsquo;black&rsquo;) square tiles and 8 light- (&lsquo;white&rsquo;) and 8 dark-colored (&lsquo;black&rsquo;) pawns.<br/><br/>Update: Anarchess has now been playtested and confirmed to also be highly playable and fun with 3 and 4 players. In a 3-player game each player gets 6 pawns, while in a 4-player game each player gets 5 pawns.<br/><br/>It takes just 5-10 minutes to learn how to play. A game lasts about 30-60 minutes.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can perform 2 actions:<br/>A. Tile Placement<br/>B. (Optional) Pawn Action (placing a new pawn, moving or attacking)<br/><br/>The game ends after a player places the last available tile. Players earn points by controlling areas (i.e., having the most pawns in them) comprising two or more tiles. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Best Candy on the Block is a trick-taking card game with a Halloween trick-or-treating theme. Gameplay is similar to many traditional trick-taking games, but there are 10 treat suits and treat cards can have one, two, or three suits on them. Additionally there are prank cards, non-treat cards, and the king size card.<br/><br/>At the start of each hand, each player gets to pick a treat suit to be their favorite which can award them bonus points at the end of the hand. One suit is also revealed to be trump. At the end of the hand, players look at all the cards they've taken and gain 1 bonus point for each card matching their favorite candy suit, unless they take too many tricks and get a belly ache, then they cannot score bonus points.<br/><br/>Pranks are worth -1 points and change the leader of the next trick. Non-treat cards can be played off suit, and the king size bar is wild and the only rank 13 card in the deck.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Krobs is a quick card game that has a scientific theme: germs we encounter on a daily basis. It is a contract game for the Institute of Microbiology of the University of Lausanne, Switzerland.<br/><br/>The game is meant to increase the awareness of the general public that some germs can be found in unexpected places, that some activities are pretty harmless, while others carry various degrees of risk.<br/><br/>For those who are interested, the scientific content of the game can be found on a dedicated website &ndash;<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.krobs.ch&ndash\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.krobs.ch&ndash</a>; or at the back of each card where a RQ code leads you to the appropriate page.<br/><br/>It is however a game first, where you try to complete 3 columns of cards in front of you, each adding up to 15. You try to achieve this before your opponents, and sometimes also try to slow them down with microbes cards if they are careless.<br/><br/>On their turn players may play up to 2 cards before drawing only 1. Those cards can be Activity cards that bring you closer to your goal (3 columns of 15 points) or Microbes cards that attack the opponents who have &quot;risky cards&quot; showing on top of their own columns. Sometimes a turn consists of only refreshing one's hand.<br/><br/>If a player is attacked, they have to reveal a disease card of the corresponding color and see how severe the attack was. Sometimes you're lucky, sometimes you're sick for a while, and every so often you may even die on the spot...<br/><br/>The first player to completes their columns secures the victory, a mix of good timing and lucky draw.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are a hero, a person with great abilities, good temperament, a strong heart, and an even stronger love for spiked eggnog. As you sit in your favorite fur-covered, sheep wool-padded chair, alone in the solitude of greatness, you hear a series of thuds on your roof, followed by what sounds like scratching against the roof tiles. Your neighbor must have lost their gryphon again. You decide to round it back up and, hopefully, you will not need a finger reattachment from the cleric again...<br/>You walk out of your cottage, it is winter but there&rsquo;s no snow on the ground. Not yet. Climate change has seemed to shift the snow into the early months of the new year (and they say it&rsquo;s a hoax?). Anyway, the towering buildings of the bustling city can be seen in the distance to your right, it is strange though&hellip; you are clearly part of a fantasy world, but the cityscape looks quite modern, like New York, Seattle, or Portland. There&rsquo;s no time to dwell on the finer details though, you have a gryphon to catch!<br/>When you look up on your roof, you do not see an eagle-lion at all. Rather, to your aghast, you see a very different creature! Above you, holding a bag full of wrapped parcels and decorated from wingtip to tail, is Kringle Klaws! You didn&rsquo;t even believe in Kringle but here she is, right in front of you. A sack full of gifts and all. What a sight to see! Not only are you shocked that you are beholding Kringle Klaws but you are nearly floored when she starts to speak to you.<br/>&ldquo;Adventurer,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Something terrible has happened and I have been forced to seek your aid. I have known of your deeds since that very first piggly-wiggly you saved over in Yazoo and I need your skills. Only you can save our holiday.&rdquo;<br/>Knowing that you are too stunned to speak, she continues. &ldquo;Another godly being has come from the land of the Vikings, the fiend calls himself &lsquo;Kris.&rsquo; He has stolen my Red Globe of Illumination and I need you to get it back before the sun sets. Without the globe, I cannot deliver the gifts to your fellow humans.&rdquo;<br/>You have only the whit to ask &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;<br/>&ldquo;I watched him place the globe into a chest strapped to one of his reindeer,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was able to follow the furry beast to a fort in the hills not far from here. There, the hooved menace passed by a large illuminated tree and disappeared down some stairs. We need to hurry, I am running out of time.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Deals with other political parties, buying judges, cheating... but you also need to take into account the other political parties and luck!<br/><br/>You can also choose your lifestyle and what proposals you are going to invest the money from your campaign into. Also you need to decide what you are going to do during your time as President to ensure you win the elections for the following year.<br/><br/>Each turn, players will roll the dice and move their token on the track - either clockwise or counter-clockwise. They then draw a card from a pile corresponding to the colour of the space they landed on. Each colour has its own actions associated with it: Green for political expertise, black for family life, purple for business, gold for bribe and deals.<br/><br/>During the game, several elections are held. During each elections, players invest money - which buys them votes. These translated in positions in congress, which will give back money. There are also special positions, which will give you different advantages. A player wins the game if he manages to get a majority during the elections (50%+1).<br/><br/>Players can negotiate alliances, which allows them to share the benefits of special positions - though it is not possible to win together.<br/><br/>",

Now, you have to evade enemies and survive the elements long enough to scrounge together a search and rescue beacon to summon help. Your time on the ground will not be easy. The odds are against you.<br/><br/>You may also be able to turn your misadventure into heroism if you can capture enemy intelligence, destroy some of their installations, or maybe find other MIA allies and return to safety with them.<br/><br/>Or maybe you'll get eaten by a bear while trying to hide from a storm in a cave.<br/><br/>IGD is a solitaire game driven by tables and cards. Inspired by games like Ambush! and Ranger, you will see the narrative of your Pilot's exploits unfold in front of you through a combination of cards drawn and tables rolled on. Careful planning and choices will be pitted against the vagaries of fate, and the wide range of available Event cards mean games can feel drastically different from one another. One game will be a ruthless hunt as you flee from dogged pursuers, another may be a battle against rains, wildfires and errant bombing runs, and the next may see the tables turned as you attack enemy installations with captured weapons.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hindsight: 2020 is a real-time cooperative dice-drafting puzzle game for 1 to 4 players. On your turn, you will select two dice of the same color from a grid of 36--the first, the ACTION DIE, determines your main action by its position and your bonus action by its value; the second die, the POWER DIE, determines the strength of first action. You will use the actions to manipulate the puzzle tiles, to alter the dice in the grid (for future turns), and to manage the timer. The adjustable difficulty level will keep you on your toes for play after play as your team gets better at solving the puzzle quickly. Thinky and frantic, saving the world has never been so fun.<br/><br/>Theme:<br/>The apocalypse is upon us! If only we&rsquo;d seen it coming. Luckily for the rest of humanity, you&rsquo;ve just finished the prototype for your new time-intervention device. Alas, it&rsquo;s a little unstable and unreliable--it is a prototype, after all. You&rsquo;ve figured out what intervention is needed to stop the apocalypse, but it takes some tinkering to get the machine aligned so your operatives can make those changes. You have just a couple minutes to find the right configuration of your machine to send back our intervention agents and save the world. Can you finish before the apocalypse arrives? Time to find out.<br/><br/>Saving the world, as fast as you can. The game has two play areas, a 6 by 6 dice grid, and a tile tableau. The dice grid has twelve actions you may take, one for each row and one for each column. At the top of the tile area are six &ldquo;keystone&rdquo; tiles numbered 1-6, representing the code you need to match. In an array of 36 tiles below the keystone line are columns of similar tiles.<br/><br/>When you select your Action die, you place it at the end of either the row or the column, indicating which action you intend to take. Then you select your Power die, another die of the same color, and place it on the Power die space outside the grid. The action you selected is augmented by the Power die, and allows you to manipulate the tile tableau or the dice grid. After you take your main action, you get a secondary action determined by the value of the action die you took. These secondary actions allow you to flip the sand timer and add more dice to the grid, among other things.<br/><br/>To solve the puzzle, you need to manipulate the tiles so that the top of each column matches the keystone number above it. When the number matches, you can &ldquo;lock&rdquo; that combination in place, triggering the bonus (or penalty) card attached to that column. You win if you are able to lock all six columns before you run out of dice or timer flips. Of course, if you ever let the timer run out, you also lose.<br/><br/>This is how the world ends:<br/>Accompanying Hindsight: 2020 is a thematic website that uses your six-digit keystone code to reveal what happened to cause the apocalypse, and how your team did or did not succeed in preventing the end of the world.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

You place one of your 9 character cards face-down, which gives little to no information to your opponent as to the strength of the card placed.

There are symbols on the tiles that active actions when you match a cookie, such as: crumble - to send another players cookies back to the tray. Burn - to send everyone's cookies back to the tray. Rolling Pin - to steal another players cookies. Cookies can be protected by using your oven mitt. Players earn their oven mitt by collecting one of each cookie variety. Once earned, place on a single stack/variety to protect them. However, the stack is frozen as well, you cannot collect that variety! Oven mitts can be moved following the game rules, and other players mitts can be moved by drawing a tile with an oven mitt symbol and matching at least one cookie.<br/><br/>It's an ever changing scramble of matching, collecting, stealing and protecting.<br/><br/>The game ends once the last tile has been drawn, played and scored.<br/><br/>The player with the most cookies wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game board in Anacund is composed of 17 wooden slats; fifteen of these slats have an ideogram at either end, with these ideograms representing the numbers 1-6. Shuffle these slats, then place them in a row, then place the remaining two slats (each with three ideograms) on either end to create a single path of 36 spaces. One of these spaces is colored red and dubbed the &quot;bonus square&quot;. Each player takes 18 of the double-sided tokens, then places them in three groups of six, with their color face up.<br/><br/>On a turn, you must place three of your tokens on the game board. The space that you place a token on must equal the number of tokens in the group before you placed that token. Thus, at the start of the game, you take a token from a group of six tokens, then place that token on a 6 space. Your next token must be placed on a 5 (if taken from the same group) or a 6 (if taken from one of your remaining two groups).<br/><br/>If after placing a token, you have sandwiched one or more of the opponent's tokens, those opposing tokens are flipped over and placed next to the spaces they once occupied. These spaces cannot be played in again. If you would create a sandwich with yourself in the middle, then your own pieces are captured &mdash; unless you have simultaneously sandwiched the opponent at the same time, in which case you capture them instead.<br/><br/>Once all the pieces have been placed, players tally their scores. Each piece showing your color, whether on the board or next to it, is worth 1 point; whoever has a piece on or next to the bonus space scores 5 points. Whoever has the higher score wins.<br/><br/>",

This expansion includes German ace pilot Eduard Tratt and additional accessories to add to the core game.<br/><br/>Eduard Tratt began the war in BF 110s, accumulating thirteen victories by the end of 1940. He pioneered the use of fighter-bombers for pin-point attacks over England before transferring to the Eastern Front. In 1943 Tratt was assigned to command a special unit evaluating the new Me 410 against USAAF heavy bombers. Tratt would eventually be killed attacking B-17s of the 91st Bomb Group in February 1944. He had achieved 38 victories, including six heavy bombers and eight P-38 fighters, across 350 combat sorties.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 Me 410 metal Plane<br/>1 Advantage Flying Base<br/>1 Double-sided Pilot Skill Disc Set<br/>1 Aircraft Card<br/>2 Aircraft Trait Cards<br/>2 Ace Skill Cards<br/>1 Eduard Tratt Ace Card<br/><br/>",

The age mark is 5 years of age, but even more feeble minded creatures will be able to simply have a lot of fun creating their own unique <br/>and gross mutations.<br/><br/>GOAL <br/>The goal of Monster Mutation is to earn points by assembling <br/>disgusting monsters. When the game ends, you will be awarded points for monsters with most eyeballs, most fins, longest monster, largets monster ect.<br/><br/>CARDS <br/>There are three types of cards:<br/><br/>1. Missions: There is a total of 10 mission cards that each layer are fighting over during the game. The mission cards decribe what type of monster combinations might give you points at the end of the game. Each mission card has its specific requirements on how to obtain its one point value. There is a total of 10 different missions. See details on the back of each mission card.<br/><br/>MONSTER PARTS<br/>There are various monster part cards:<br/>A. Red/weapons Allows a mutation to eat meat.<br/>B. Green/mouths allow a mutation to eat plants.<br/>C. Blue/Finns allow a mutations to swim.<br/>D. Purple/Legs allow a mutation to run.<br/>E. Yellow/Eyes allow a creature to see better.<br/>F. Connecters have multible open endings and allow you to build        larger creatures.(Size matters).<br/><br/>3. Hourglass: This card can be used to define when the game ends.<br/><br/>SET UP THE GAME<br/>All monster part cards are placed in a single pile in the middle of the table, it is referred to as the monster part pile. The mission cards are all placed face up, next to each other so the possible missions can be seen.<br/><br/>START THE GAME<br/>Place the hourglass card face down some where in the lower half of the monster part pile. The more players you play the further down in the pile you should place it. You can also choose to exclude the hourglass card, and simply play until the monster card pile is empty.<br/><br/>EACH TURN<br/>1. Draw 2 cards from the monster card pile.<br/>2. Place the monster cards face up on the table in front of you.<br/>3. You may connect monster parts that fits together (as shown below).<br/>Note that you may only have a maximum of three unfinished monsters at the same time. Once a card has been put together with another, they are locked in place and may not be separated.<br/><br/>FITS TOGETHER In order for two monster parts to fit together, their open endings must have the same size. Thin part endings cannot be connected to thick part endings, vice versa.<br/><br/>UNFINISHED MONSTER A unfinished monster is one who has one or more open endings. A single part also counts as a unfinished monster.<br/><br/>GAME ENDS The game ends when the hourglass card has been drawn. <br/>All unfinished creatures instantly dies, and are put away. <br/>As they may not be included in the final score.<br/>WINNER The winner of the game is the one who earns the most mission cards.

You and your team will describe outrageous words and phrases, act them out, give one-word hints, then act them out again under a sheet. Score points by quickly getting your team to guess cards correctly while using the rule for each round.<br/><br/>FOREPLAY: SETTING UP<br/>Step 1:<br/>Split into teams&ndash; ideally 2 teams of 3 to 6 people.<br/><br/>Step 2:<br/>The game should consist of about 45 cards total. To start, everyone gets 10 random cards and places a few of their favorites face down in a pile until there are enough.<br/><br/>HINT: Don&rsquo;t share your cards with anyone, even the other players on your team!<br/><br/>HINT: The number of olives indicates the dirtiness of the card. The more olives, the dirtier it is.<br/><br/>Step 3:<br/>Combine and shuffle all chosen cards from both teams into one pile &amp; put them face down on a table, in a bowl, or in the box. All cards, regardless of who chose them, will be used by both teams.<br/><br/>Step 4:<br/>Choose your least favorite people to keep score and time.<br/><br/>DOING IT: HOW TO PLAY<br/>Each Sheet Head gets a 60 second turn to try to get their team to guess as many cards as possible using the rule for that round. Once a card is drawn, it must either be guessed correctly or returned to the pile when time expires. Teams take turns guessing cards &ndash; every member of a team should take their turn as Sheet Head before any teammate repeats.<br/><br/>Each of the 4 rounds end after all cards are guessed correctly. To start the next round, reshuffle all the cards and continue in the order you left off.<br/><br/>HINT: If your memory sucks, read the cards aloud after the first round.<br/><br/>THE POSITIONS<br/>Round 1: Sheet Talking<br/>Sheet Heads get their team to guess the card without saying any part of the words on the card.<br/><br/>Do&rsquo;s: Speaking &ndash; Like texting, but with your mouth.<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;ts: Act, gesture, rhyme, spell, abbreviate, say any part of a word on the card.<br/><br/>Round 2: Be Charade, Be Very Charade!<br/>Sheet Heads get their team to guess the card by acting. This should sound familiar.<br/><br/>Do&rsquo;s: Act, Gesture, Point.<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;ts: Talk, make noises, spell with your hands.<br/><br/>Round 3: The S-Word<br/>Players get their team to guess the card by saying only ONE word. This is more challenging than you Sheet Heads think.<br/><br/>Do&rsquo;s: Say ONE word, use different Inflections, use accents.<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;ts: Say another word, mouth other words, gestures, rhyming, Use a word or part of a word on the card, suck.<br/><br/>Round 4: Sheet Show<br/>The Sheet Head puts a sheet over their head and acts out the clues.<br/><br/>Do&rsquo;s: Act out the card under the sheet, you Dumb Sheet.<br/><br/>Don&rsquo;ts: Talk, come out from under the sheet, make noises.<br/><br/>THE CLIMAX: HOW TO WIN<br/>The team with the most correctly guessed cards after all 4 rounds wins. We don&rsquo;t care how you keep score, but tally scoring or collecting correctly guessed cards does the job.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Euclio is a snappy combination of card drafting and worker placement where players vie to earn the most trophies by claiming and manipulating various scoring boards, but beware! Only players with scoring markers on each board will gain its payout, but that won't stop the other players from using cards that alter it!<br/><br/>Euclio is played over three game rounds that involve drafting cards, playing them to manipulate the boards and claim scoring opportunities, and finally scoring the boards themselves. Players can enter into pseudo alliances with players who share their scoring boards, while other players may play (or withhold) cards that hamper your plans.<br/><br/>By only using a subset of the scoring boards, every game will be different as the boards determine what suit cards are in play with varying effects. Even among the same boards, their arrangement changes scoring timings for even more strategic variety!<br/><br/>Simple rules make game-play itself very straightforward: on your turn either play a card face up for its effect, or face down to lay claim with a scoring marker. It's important to set your scoring markers on the most lucrative spaces before they run out of room, but doing so reduces your control, as without unused scoring markers, you must play cards face up for their effects, even if they help your opponents, and the earlier you commit your scoring markers, the less certain you can be about the final state of each scoring board.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

With her father being one of the rare pilots in her home country, Sarnai learned to fly at an early age. A natural talent, she started flying between her hometown and Irkutsk, carrying love letters, precious merchandises and shady characters. When her country officially joined the war effort against Axis powers, she then joined the newly formed Mongolian Arat Squadron, in 1943. Her impressive skills soon proved to be invaluable and she was transferred to the 46th &ldquo;Taman&rdquo; Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment (the &ldquo;Night Witches&rdquo;). Accumulating an impressive score of victories, she was tasked to form the 179th Guards Assault Aviation Regiment that she now commands. It was the first unit to receive the &ldquo;Grom&rdquo; (thunder in Russian)in the Red Air Force. The Mil Mi-47Z &ldquo;Grom&rdquo; Tesla Assault Helicopter is the latest addition to the already impressive arsenal of the VVS. Quickly catching up with their German counterparts, the Soviet engineers have miniaturized their VK generator enough so they can fit inside the tight fuselage of an attack helicopter. This gives the aircraft a tremendous firepower, almost without equal on the planet. It takes incredible piloting skills to hit anything with Tesla guns from the air, but the results are devastating: the whole enemy aircraft shuts down, its controls (or pilot...) fried.<br/><br/>This reference comes with three Dust 1947 unit cards. Like all regular Dust 1947 miniatures, it comes already assembled and primed. It's ready for the battlefield, or for painting, as you wish!

They are tasked with channeling the necessary mystical energies from the Elemental Oinks to awaken the runic manifest arriving from the various realms so as to inscribe powerful spells into scrolls ready to be cast by their prodigious masters at the snap of fingers during deadly battles of magic.

Players take on the role of an arcane scribe choosing and inscribing spells onto their master&rsquo;s scroll by activating the required number and type of Oinks. The value of the collection of spells scribed depends on the strategic choices made and can be measured in terms of victory points.<br/><br/>Victory points are tabulated as follows:<br/><br/>1. The victory points from each spell card scribed are equal to the FACE VALUE of the spell card. E.g. A Telegate spell is worth 8 victory points.<br/> 2. The victory points of each spell card of an element double if all other players have less spells of that element in terms of number of spells scribed.<br/><br/>3. Reserved spells that are not scribed are worth 0 victory points.<br/><br/>Ending Condition<br/><br/>The game will end immediately when there are less spells cards than the number of players in play.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>Players start the game by each drawing a card from the top of the common shuffled FULL SPELL DECK. The player with the highest number starts first and the players get their turns in a clockwise manner. The drawn cards go back to the bottom of the FULL SPELL DECK. In the case of ties, the tied players draw again till the turns are resolved.<br/><br/>Players then draw 5 world tiles from a stack of shuffled world tiles faced up from topmost first. The world tiles are put adjacent to each other in a row side by side faced up. 5 spells cards are drawn from a re-shuffled FULL SPELL DECK and placed on each of these world tiles from left to right. The rest of the spell cards in the FULL SPELL DECK remain face down as a pile.<br/><br/>Additional Notes<br/><br/>Each player may only have a maximum of 5 Oinks (of any type) in their possession. Any above this limit must be immediately discarded back to the common supply. Players may choose what they want to discard whenever this limit is exceeded. Whenever the common supply is not able to fulfil any needs, the need will be unfulfilled.<br/><br/>Game Flow<br/><br/>During each turn, players can do one of these four actions:<br/><br/>1. Take 2 Oinks of different elements from the common supply.<br/><br/>2. Exchange 1 Oink for up to 3 Oinks from the common supply. The Oink must be of a different element from the 3 Oinks traded. The 3 Oinks must be of the same element type.<br/><br/>3. Reserve a spell card and place it face down in the respective player&rsquo;s personal playing space till it is scribed at the normal cost. For 1 &ndash; 4 players, up to 2 spell cards can be reserved at one time.<br/><br/>4. Scribe a spell card and pay for the cost depending on the FACE VALUE of the spell card. 1 Oink of any element is required for each unit of the FACE VALUE. E.g. for a FACE VALUE of 9, 9 Oinks must be expended and returned to the common supply. If the Oink used is of the same element type as the spell card to be scribed, it will count as 2 Oinks for this purpose. E.g. An ASHW spell of FACE VALUE 9 can be scribed with 4 ASHW Oinks and 1 Oink of any other element.<br/><br/>When a player either reserve or scribe a spell card and the spell is moved from the world tile to the player&rsquo;s personal playing space, the elemental insignias on the world tile will be revealed and a follow up effect for the rest of the players occurs.<br/><br/>1. If there is only 1 elemental insignia on the world tile, the rest of the players get an Oink of that element from the common supply.<br/><br/>2. If there are 2 elemental insignias on the world tile and they are different, the rest of the players can choose to get 1 Oink of an element from either element but not both. If the 2 elemental insignias are the same, there will be no choice.<br/><br/>3. If there are 3 elemental insignias on the world tile, the rest of the players can chose to exchange 1 Oink for up to 3 Oinks of elements matching the elemental insignias. The Oink that is traded must be of a different element type from any of the elemental insignia(s) on the world tile.<br/><br/>4. If there are 4 elemental insignias on the world tile, it is an ARENA world tile and players can choose to take 1 Oink of any of the 4 elements present from the common supply.<br/><br/>After this follow up effect, the world tile is discarded and a new world tile is drawn from the stack to replace its position and anther spell card is drawn from the FULL SPELL DECK to replace the spell card that has been just scribed or reserved. The ending condition is then checked to see if the game should end and victory points calculated according to the winning conditions to determine a winner. When there is a tie, the player with a greater variety of spells scribed in terms of element types wins, If there is still a tie, the player with more Oinks in his/her possession wins. If this does not break the final tie, let the players rejoice in their joint victory.<br/><br/>Adjustment for more players<br/><br/>The game can be adjusted to accommodate up to 8 players if there are sufficient Oinks to satisfy the component requirements. For 5 - 8 players, only 1 spell card can be reserved at one time.<br/><br/>",

In the game, players act as forest rangers, whose ultimate goal is to re-build the protection forest.<br/><br/>The game includes a mix of set collection and tile placement with grid movement features. By tree nursery, forestation, and performing rescue missions, players can re-build the protection forest and provide a natural shelter to defend natural disasters.<br/><br/>Each player round is divided into three steps:<br/><br/>Step 1. Collect Sapling Resources: Each player can either collect a mixed type of 3 sapling resources, or collect all of one single type of sapling resources from the table.<br/><br/>Step 2. Forest Tile Placement: Draw a hexagonal forest tile and place it on the table. Should the tile indicate an incident, then draw an incident card and activate.<br/><br/>Step 3. Forestation: Use the player's sapling resources for forestation. If the resource required for a tile is fulfilled, then a tree meeple is placed on the tile along with a player token.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the tiles are drawn. Scores are calculated by the achievement of basic missions and special missions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This however can be altered by the judge, considering the type of campaign desired.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The game consists of two digest-sized books: a 12-page Referee's Manual (blue cover) and a 28-page Player's Manual (yellow cover).<br/><br/>The Referee's Manual begins with rules for creating the referee's hex map of the galaxy. The map is randomly populated with solar systems and gas clouds. In addition to the player-controlled solar systems, which are all inhabited by technologically advanced &quot;spacegoing&quot; civilizations, non-player systems are generated by the referee. These non-player systems vary by industrial level, military resistance, and spaceflight capabilities (if any). Spacegoing non-player systems have randomly determined race and culture characteristics which serve to impact the War Roll (a die-roll determination of whether a meeting between opposing spacegoing forces is peaceful or results in conflict). The War Roll is also impacted by the government types of the involved civilizations. Finally, the Referee's Manual includes rules for research and technology that allow solar systems to advance and develop more powerful weaponry and spacecraft, including improvements in spacecraft propulsion ranging from sublight to hyperlight speeds.<br/><br/>The Player's Manual explains the various planet types, the process for planetary industrialization, and the planetary installations that players can construct. The details of spaceship construction and associated costs are set forth for the game's two general classes of vessels: warships and merchants. Three classes of troops are available to the players: combat troops, engineers, and android troops (also referred to in the rules as robot troops). The Player's Manual includes the game's rules for movement and combat. These rules cover both tactical space battles (with distinctions for sublight and hyperlight vessels) and man-to-man land battles. Both types of battles rely on tabletop-miniatures-style rules, with movement being simultaneous based on written orders. The game also allows for &quot;strategic combat&quot; on the galaxy map in the form of minefields laid in space.<br/><br/>In addition to the rules booklets, the game requires hex sheets, paper/notebooks, pencils, two to four 20-sided dice, one (?) 10-sided die, and an unspecified number of six-sided dice.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

You need to print out the rules and player aid card, and optionally the player mat to help keep things organized &ndash; you also need a deck of ordinary playing cards, with one Joker.<br/><br/>During each game turn, players will begin by revealing the Event Card that will be in effect during that turn. Then, both players will receive a number of cards from a deck of ordinary playing cards, and play them onto Diplomatic, Information or Military Fronts (or keep them in a Reserve, for a later turn). After this, players will compare the totals of cards played to see if one player will score Victory Points on a given Front, and whether one or both players will lose cards and Victory Points. Game has a variable end point.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

This resource production is taken before the results of the volcano eruption are resolved. Note that while the Robber can not prevent the Volcano from erupting, he does prevent any player from producing resources from the Volcano hex if he has been placed there.<br/><br/>-Playing with the Seafarers Expansion<br/>When playing the Volcano scenario with the seafarers expansion, the Volcano tile can replace any desert or sea tile that all players agree on. The only restriction is that whichever tile is replaced by the Volcano must be adjacent to at least two other resource-producing land tiles.<br/><br/>-Krakatoa Variant<br/>This variant is for use only with the Seafarers expansion.

        "description": "Oom-Pah is a competitive speed game that combines Klondike Solitaire style columns, with snap style 'first in best dressed', with music theory.<br/><br/>You get a deck of cards with notes on them. You put four of them in front of you, as your 'Arrange Columns'. You put aside 8 of them as your 'Score Stack'. Finally, the remainder are placed next to your columns as your 'Impro Stack'. You draw from your Impro Stack in groups of 3 cards like Draw 3 in Klondike Solitaire. When there is a card in your Impro Stack or Score Stack that is the card under one of the ones on the top of your columns (like E is to F), then you can place the card there. Alternatively, if one of your cards in your Arrange Columns, Score Stack or Impro Stack is the next note in the Chord/Interval/Progression/Scale that you're playing with in the joint Compose Stacks, (like C is to A if you were playing Am (A-C-E)), then you can place it in the Compose Stack. It is not turn based - you work as quickly as you can, meaning that the faster player can place their card before the other. When a player empties their score stack, they yell 'Oom-Pah!' and get 10 points. Then each player gets points per the amount of cards that they played to the Score stack.<br/><br/>The game comes with 10 templates which have on them musical theory bits like Scales, Intervals and Chords. You can choose from any of them to play with, depending on the level of difficulty required, or what the players are trying to reinforce. So, for instance, you could play G Major, and require that players build G-A-B-C-D-E-F# in the score stack.<br/><br/>The game also comes with beginner, intermediate and expert rules which allow tailoring the experience.<br/><br/>From the publisher<br/>Oom-Pah! For music nerds &amp; legends&hellip; or those who wanna be! An addictive, fast-paced, brainfrying music theory card game that cleverly sneaks music knowledge into your brain!  <br/>For 1-4 players, think classic card games like Speed/Spit (if challenging friends), or Patience/Solitaire (if playing solo), but instead you build musical sequences! <br/>Oom-Pah!'s unique colour-coded learning tools help you understand music concepts systematically. So whether you're an absolute beginner or musical maestro, you can compete at a level playing field. <br/>With over 1,700 different game options to choose from you&rsquo;ll always be engaged, entertained, &amp; highly entertained! Other than making you really smart and an awesome musician, the best thing about playing this game is the thrill of shouting &ldquo;Oom-Pah!&rdquo; when you win!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Recently Brett Simpson pointed me at a simple set of rules for the English Civil War called Rupert's Very Bad Day: Battle of Marston Moor (1644 AD): Fast Play Rules for Students by Matt Fritz.  Rupert's Very Bad Day relies on lots of bases and base removal so isn't very friendly with my big bases and Thirty Years War units with both pike and shot on the same base.  But I liked the simplicity, saw considerable potential, and really liked the name. So I immediately began writing a version that would suit my pike and shot for the Thirty Years War which are based on big bases (80mm x 40mm). My initial draft started very close to Matt Fritz's work, and I remain heavily indebted to him, howeverthe rules have evolved quite far from the original. The biggest similarity to the original rules is probably the name although even there &quot;Rupert&quot; became &quot;Tilly&quot;.  I have introduced more types of stand (light horse, pike+shot, rabble), single stand units (hence pike+shot), a new concept called &quot;resolve&quot; to replace stand removal, morale rules based on resolve, terrain including the option to allow infantry to &quot;defend the hill&quot;, distances based on base width, a more complex interplay of shooting and charging to reflect different national and unit attitudes to these combat options, increase purpose for commanders, optional troop quality (superior, ordinary, inferior, rabble) and hence an optional point system, and probably other things. Despite these additions, and the complexity they bring, I think the rules still allow &quot;fast play&quot;. Although I've got the Thirty Years War in mind &quot;Tilly's Very Bad Day&quot; should be applicable to the Eighty Years War and English Civil War.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Designed for children, but adults can also play seriously.<br/><br/>Planet Go Round is an open memory game. As cards are turned up from the deck, all the players get to see them. Then the card is given to a player's hand. There are four cards in each of seven suites. If a player receives a duplicate card into their hand, the paradox damages the Universe. They pay a penalty chip to the person who gave them the card.<br/><br/>The player with the fewest chips at the end is the winner. So players are trying to distribute the cards to other players without drawing a penalty to themselves. This means they must remember what cards others are holding or have discarded.<br/><br/>There is a Challenge mode too, if a player can get all seven suites into their discards.<br/><br/>「私たちの宇宙の神様が酔いつぶれちゃった〜！？」<br/>各プレイヤーは様々な別の世界の神様です。<br/>みんなで橋渡しをして、惑星たちを太陽系にもどそう！<br/><br/>5歳からでも出来る、お手軽メモリーゲーム。<br/>キッズ向け、でも大人も本気で遊べます！<br/>メカニズムとしては各プレイヤーの手札と捨て札を暗記しながら、7種各4枚あるカードを重複しないように渡していく全公開の暗記ゲームです。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>Easy instruction of the rules:<br/>Each player draw a card from deck in his turn. The player should reveal this newly drawn card to all other players. Then the player must give this card to any other player.<br/>If that player already has same card of given in his hand...<br/>... a paradox happens and his universe explodes!<br/>Then the player who gave that card gains meteor token.<br/>When the meteor token in the token pool runs out, the game ends and the player who has the fewest tokens wins!<br/><br/>However, what you can do when there is no one safe to give it to? Indeed! If you suspect every player already has same card which you have to give, you can discard it instead of giving. Additionally, a player can hold only two cards in his hand, therefore, when a player who already holds two cards is given a card, he must discard the oldest card. For this reason, surely you will be confused if the card you saw before has been discarded, or not...!<br/><br/>Additionally, you can perform a 'challenge!' before draw a card. When you try a 'challenge', check a player's discard pile. If all 7 suits are included in the discard pile, you pass the test, and you can return a meteor token back to token pool. Do your best to memorize each players' hands and discarded cards!<br/><br/>Background Story:<br/>This universe is in danger! Specifically, it explodes!<br/><br/>One day, the Gods have come to hold a party. The guests of honor of this party are the planets that the gods brought up under their own care. So, the party became lively! It was good so far, but ...<br/><br/>The god of solar-system, your universe, has drunk too much and fallen asleep. Oh my gosh, good heavens, the planets cannot get back to their proper places without their god. Under this situation... you are the gods of other universes.<br/><br/>Please, players must co-operate, and let the planets go back to their solar-system by handing over the right planets among the players. But beware, if a god bears same two planets at a time, a paradox happens, and one of universes explodes, the planet becoming a meteor. So, which god performs best in this accident?<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Black cards represent rooms, which are added one at a time using special &quot;docking&quot; requirements.  Red cards represent either treasures or monsters: even-numbered cards are treasures and odd-numbered cards are monsters.<br/><br/>In addition, rooms, treasures and monsters are classified as either Physical or Psychic.  Clubs and Hearts are Physical, while Spades and Diamonds are Psychic.  Two of the dice are used as point trackers for Physical and Psychic attributes.<br/><br/>To win the game you must explore each room and defeat each monster without running out of either attribute.<br/><br/>Each card has a description given in the Card Guide.  Here are examples to give an idea of the flavor:<br/><br/>&quot;4: Room of Eerie Whistling: The walls are covered in what looks like ancient paper wasp nests. Wind blows out of the holes in keening chords.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;9: Cloaked Man: A human in a black cloak. The cloak bursts apart, for it is actually the wing covers of a huge insect. The head unfolds as two spiky legs, and a glow-eyed face with huge mandibles raises up with a horrible hissing noise.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;8: Grimoire of Abjuration: A text to rebuke evil spirits in the strongest terms possible.&quot;<br/><br/>The Rules and Card Guide will be given in the Files section.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

To make a people great it is necessary to send them to battle even if you have to kick them in the pants. That is what I shall do&rdquo;.&mdash;Benito Mussolini.<br/><br/>Following the successful stand by the Republicans at Madrid, Nationalist Generalissimo, Francisco Franco issued an urgent call for reinforcements to his Fascist German and Italian supporters. Dictator Benito Mussolini responded by sending tens of thousands of &ldquo;volunteers&rdquo; made up into the &ldquo;Corpo di Truppe Volontarie&rdquo; (CTV). Many of the divisions of the CTV were composed of &quot;Camicie Nere&quot; (Black Shirts), fascist party thugs who saw their participation in the military as a fast track path to privilege and advancement back at home. Mussolini asked Franco for his CTV to lead the &ldquo;final&rdquo; assault to take Madrid. The Italian commanders suggested the attack take place as soon as possible in March when the worst of the winter storms should be over, and before the Republican&rsquo;s reinforcements that were pouring into their ports and across the border from France, could be deployed. The focus of the attack was the key crossroads town of Guadalajara north and east of Madrid; its capture would compel a Republican withdrawal that would severely weaken their hold on the capital.

It&rsquo;s estimated that the asteroid, dubbed Wormwood, will reach earth&rsquo;s atmosphere in 24 days. Meanwhile, you are an officer aboard the Gryphon, an AI controlled space cruiser, when your employer alerts you of your next mission. It sounds simple enough. A standard security check on an abandoned nuclear power facility. You will slowly uncover truths that connect to the fast approaching artifact.<br/><br/>Players will use an action point system to navigate through space finding the necessary technologies needed to stop the asteroid. One player will play as the ship A.I., Gabriel, using a web app to guide the 1-5 Officer players on planetary missions to accomplish the goals necessary to win. Officer players will acquire suit armor upgrades and weapons upgrades to fight against the threats attempting to keep the asteroid on its course. Missions will take you through space to industrial facilities, military strongholds, and alien architecture.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The two operations were both planned and executed quickly, and with almost disastrous results. The fighting on Crete was vicious, and the casualties among the German forces so great that it caused the cancellation of the last of the above operations -&ldquo; the invasion of Malta. Unlike the invasion of Crete, which was rushed and undertaken against numerically superior Allied forces, the invasion of Malta was very well planned, and would have been done with overwhelming numbers. It is indeed fortunate for the Allied war effort that the operation was cancelled.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seeing Red is a solitaire game on the British Royal Navy&rsquo;s raid on the Kronstadt naval base during the Russian Revolution. Even before the armistice with Germany ended the fighting along the Western Front in WWI, British, French and US forces were deployed to attack Soviet controlled Russia to undermine and perhaps overthrow the Communists from power in Russia. One of the more daring Allied attacks occurred when a British flotilla of Coastal Motor Boats (CMB) was dispatched to raid the Soviet occupied naval base of Kronstadt. The raiders were supported by aircraft launched by the world&rsquo;s first aircraft carrier, HMS Vindictive, making this one of the first combined air/sea attacks in military history.<br/><br/>Soviet warships based at Kronstadt safeguarded St. Petersburg (soon to be renamed Leningrad), and were severely contesting Allied warships in the Baltic. The harbor was considered one of the most heavily fortified ports in Europe, and many in the British Admiralty considered the raid a suicidal gamble. The active player takes on the role of the commanders of the British ships and aircraft. You must endeavor to overcome the Soviet defenses and night-time visibility to inflict as much damage as possible before being killed, captured or fleeing, and then escaping with those vessels and aircraft that survive. Can you do as well or better?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Take control of four Underworld everyday Jane&rsquo;s and Joe&rsquo;s, and fight off the best the wealthy one-percenters can afford. Utilizing scares, wards, and powerful abilities, guard The Scare Factory and keep those secrets safe.<br/><br/>The Scare Factory is a 1-4 player cooperative game that combines tower defense and maze building concepts into a 90-to-120 minute romp split into two phases.<br/><br/>Each game will begin with the random pulling of rule cards that define an almost infinite set of scenarios for the enemy invasion. During the first phase, players will build a maze and set traps with resources that the rule card&rsquo;s defined. It&rsquo;s integral that players work together to build scare chains that drive away roaming mercenaries and occultists, as each fleeing foe will deplete the bosses vast resources and HP. However, with each turn, the summoning of the boss moves closer and once it arrives, their resources, which during phase one are inactive, become active, and the challenge to keep the Underworld secrets safe becomes much more daunting.<br/><br/>To give any hope of success, players must empower their Underworld characters cooperatively with ability cards that double as their HP, and a leveling system built on scaring. Only by working together and creating powerful character builds and combinations, will the player defend the Scare Factory and keep the secrets safe.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blasted Planets Skirmish, is basically a set of house rules a few friends and I use to play games with my Sci-Fi figures. I am not trying to model a &quot;Hard&quot; Sci-Fi environment here. I'm borrowing as much from Horror and Fantasy as I am from Sci-Fi. I mean how serious can you be. When you have, Dog headed, Gator men chasing an Elephant guy around an Omni Field generating White rabbit? There is enough &quot;real&quot; world framework here that basic tactics work (most of the time). But enough of a fantastical element that you really can't count on the idea that the Fin headed alien with the pin gun is going to nail the cave man with the rock every time.<br/><br/>One thing for sure is I am not even trying to come up with a back story for this nonsense. That of course does not mean that you can't. Half or maybe even more than half of the fun of this game is cooking up an army before the game that that functions in some strange way that will confuse or irritate your opponent. If we had a back-story or universal framework that would on some levels really blow that idea out of the water.<br/><br/>On another note the rule formatting is kind of weird. I'm not pretending that it is clever, it's just a reflection of the way my mind works and how I make sense out of things. But I think that it is comprehensible to most &quot;Wargamers&quot; the phrasing in some cases is really tortured. You can thank the fact, that several of my buddies are Super competitors, for this. When you run in to a sentence or paragraph that feels like you are creeping through a minefield there is a real good chance some egregious abuse on the table of an earlier phrasing, required some careful phraseology. The guys you play with may not need this sort of structure. But most of the guys I play with are (at least when rules interpretation is concerned) fundamentally evil in nature. I'm not talking about your basic hearty laugh at a handicapped person trying to struggle to their feet in the grocery aisle after a fall from the wheel chair. I'm talking about the type of stuff that ensures most of these guys will probably spend a good part of eternity as consultants at the right hand of Satan himself. By reading the rules especially some, special abilities and the way they can be combined, and looking at my figures you can probably and rightly conclude that I have my own share of disturbing thoughts. But half of the time these guys leave me feeling like I'm Bo Peep in John Wayne Gacey's crawl space. I'm mentioning all this not as an excuse, but as an explanation as to why the rules are written the way that they are. I mean, I have to be able, when these guys try something particularly twisted, to say, &quot;that?s clearly not, what the intention of that rule is.&quot; Of course the easy way out is just always pointing out, that these rules are a perpetually open Beta project.<br/><br/>So that is why we have the Blasted Planets Forum. I am going to do my best to check in at least every couple of days and try to respond to any questions or ideas you all may have. We have played enough games over the years that I know that with the right approach it is possible to play a game with these rules with out any mid game re writes. That is not to say that there are no re-write artifacts in the rules and that the punctuation all works right. If you run in to a problem and come up with a solution for it, please go ahead and post it to the forum. An important thing to remember though is that with all the possible Special ability combinations it is quite possible to come up with an army that just won't work against the enemy you are facing. No matter how hard you try and no matter how well you roll the dice. If you use 600pt armies on a 4x4 or 4x5 table you can probably knock out a couple of games in an after noon. One thing I have always enjoyed is playing two games with the same armies and table set up but giving each player a chance to play each side. This is especially gratifying if one player has gone in to full on Gloat mode after defeating a thoroughly outclassed opposing army.<br/><br/>One last thing is a note on terrain; the rules as written cover use of flat top contours for elevation. I know that not every one uses this type of terrain. So Line of site line of fire rules are probably the thing that will most often have to be adapted to whatever you happen to use. I have written no rules for the use of buildings so knock yourself out in that area. I have some nice buildings but have not figured out as way to use them that I like in this type of games. All the other games I play use built up areas rather than individual buildings and I do not think that that fits well with Blasted Planets Skirmish.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A competitive card game for 2-6 players. Each player receives a unique hero and a fate filled with unexpected life-threatening events. It's up to you to face your destiny or to pass it to your friend and be on your merry way.<br/><br/>Setting up the game<br/>Shuffle the deck and deal six cards to each player. At random, give each player one Main Hero and one Sacrificial Minion. Place the Main Hero and Sacrificial Minion cards in front of you so that everyone can see them. Add two additional Minion, two additional Superminion and all 12 Disaster cards to the deck. If there are 5-6 players, then add the special disaster card to the deck as well. Shuffle the deck again and begin the game.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>All players take turns in order one at a time. A player can play any amount of action cards from their hand during their turn. To finish their turn they must draw a card from the pile. If they happen to draw a disaster card, then they must play this card immediately. After the Disaster card is played, players check if they can use the Sacrificial Minion effect. If they can then the disaster moves forward to the next chosen player.  If no, then the player will check the Main Hero effect. If that effect works then the disaster moves forward to the next player if no, then the player can play any cards from their hand that work with the current open disaster. Any player can use the Main Hero effects during each disaster once. The disaster moves forward until a player cannot play anymore cards. In that case the player sacrifices one of their Minion cards. With that their turn ends and the game continues on from the point at which the player drew the disaster. If there are no Minions left to sacrifice then you will lose the Main Hero and so the game.<br/><br/>End of the game<br/>Last one alive from the disasters wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Tropical Storm picks up the story, as a German squadron arrives to aid the Brazilians and the naval war continues.<br/><br/>The Second Great War is our alternative-history setting, in which American President Woodrow Wilson&rsquo;s attempt to mediate an end to the fighting succeeds, leaving the great empires intact to fight again a generation later. War spreads around the globe, eventually engulfing the empires&rsquo; South American allies.<br/><br/>Like all the other Second Great War at Sea games and books, Tropical Storm uses the rules from Second World War at Sea and is fully compatible with that series&rsquo; historical games.<br/><br/>Tropical Storm includes a map (covering Argentina&rsquo;s central coast) and 80 new die-cut, silky smooth playing pieces (60 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 20 standard-sized square ones). Thirty new scenarios move the story along, and put even more hot battleship action on your gaming table.<br/><br/>Tropical Storm is not a complete game. You&rsquo;ll need a copy of Tropic of Capricorn (and only Tropic of Capricorn) to play its scenarios.<br/><br/>",

The Grand Warlord&rsquo;s hordes were further swollen as the visions of Ork Weirdboyz compelled their warbands to join the Great Waaagh from light years away.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Rune Priests of the Space Wolves received visions of their own, foretelling the unification of the greenskin race.

It is based on a game that exists in his book series. It resembles a rustic game made by strange beings from another imaginary world. It plays like a combination of stratego and chess while capturing the randomizing excitement of being dealt a hand of cards.<br/><br/>It begins when you roll all 16 of your 6-sided &quot;ballit&quot; game pieces, creating one of over 20,000 possible combinations. Gain victory by one of two paths: capturing all your opponent&rsquo;s Moons and Stars, or reaching your opponent&rsquo;s Treasure Stone. Use Paths, Safes, Pits, and Traps to change how Moons and Stars move around the board. Once the board is set, choose from a number of Deity Figurines that progress along notches in the board and unlock a variety of bonus abilities. The player with the best strategy wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

They will be tasked with hiring performers and directors as well as sourcing the best scripts for their projects.<br/><br/>The game consists of six years, with each year containing four seasons (which are represented on the board, thus a full game moves around the board six times). During each season, play proceeds through three phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Progress films towards release (each film takes two years from launch to release). If the film reaches the final stage and is released, it will then be scored using the cards that make up the film (script, director and performers) as well as any other bonuses that have been applied. Dice will also be rolled, which may impact the final score.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Take actions. Primarily these will be used for gathering resources such as money, directors, performers and scripts. Other actions include trading with other players and playing special cards that provide bonuses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Put films into production. Each film requires a script, director (whose genre matches that of the script) and a minimum of two performers (a maximum of four performers).<br/><br/><br/>Points and additional advantages are generated when a film scores well with the audience, award ceremonies, critics or simply makes a lot of money. However, lower scores in any of those categories will be penalised.<br/><br/>After six years, the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We shall meet in Vienna includes everything you need to begin recreating the two phases of the War of Liberation in Germany: organization, maps, historical briefings, and uniforms.<br/><br/>During the passionate negotiations of the spring of 1813 between France and Austria, Napoleon would dismiss Metternich by declaring, We shall meet in Vienna! threatening to repeat the capture of the Austrian capital as he had done in 1805 and again in 1809.<br/><br/>Desperately short of cavalry, having just raised a new army of largely raw recruits, rallying around a cadre of survivors from the invasion of Russia, Napoleon took command of La Grande Arm&eacute;e in the spring of 1813 determined to turn back the coalition forces seeking to dismantle the French Empire.<br/><br/>We shall meet in Vienna offers nine scenarios covering The Spring Campaign and the period After the Armistice: <br/><br/>     1st M&ouml;ckern<br/>     L&uuml;tzen <br/>     Bautzen <br/>     Gro&szlig;beern &ndash; and a second scenario for Blankenfelde <br/>     Katzbach <br/>     Dresden <br/>     Hagelberg <br/>     1st Kulm <br/><br/><br/>250 pages, The Wargaming Company&rsquo;s largest Campaign Guide to-date. <br/>Additionally, We shall meet in Vienna offers a late war uniform guide with over 1500 uniform plates, all in full color, covering every unit featured in the scenarios.<br/><br/>We shall meet in Vienna, 1813 in Germany is compatible with Et sans r&eacute;sultat! (both ESR Original Edition &amp; ESR Second Edition), and nearly any other Napoleonic tabletop wargame.

Each section is modular, making it easy for players to use the appropriate rules, and to select the exact level of game detail desired. More than 20 different sections are included, among them:Blunt Trauma: When Body Armor stops a bullet, it only stops the penetration; it does not necessarily stop the severe bruising and possible broken bones which may result from the bullet's impact. The wounds caused by non-penetrating rounds, called Blunt Trauma, are fully discussed.<br/><br/>Smoke: A common factor on many battlefields, Smoke provides vital protection from the enemy during dashes across streets and open areas, towards hostile positions, and during retreats. The full effects of Smoke are explained including the duration of Smoke clouds generated by Smoke Grenades, the effects of wind on the cloud, and the partial visibility possible while the smoke clears.<br/><br/>Blind Fire: The standard response to enemy Smoke screens, Blind Fire (firing without being able to see the target) can also be vital in house-to-house fighting, when pinned by enemy fire, or providing harassing fire against unseen opponents.<br/><br/>Among the other sections included are: Ballistic Accuracy; Weapon Reliability and Weapon Damage; the Three Round Burst; Explosive Ammunition; Permanent Disabling Injuries; Effective Minimum Arc; Optical Scopes; Spotting; Cover Generation; Large Scale Battlefields; Leadership; Ground Burst Explosions; Mines and Traps; Time of Flight; Evasive Action; Recoil Recovery; Off Hand Fire; Free Actions; Skills; Training; and Experience.<br/><br/>-from the back of the book<br/><br/>",

In the other case, the hacker with the highest individual score (bitcoin) wins; which creates some healthy paranoia amongst the hackers.<br/><br/>The CISO starts with (at least) one defence card (&quot;security measure&quot;) per type of attack and a starting budget in euro.

        "description": "Welcome to Renegade Scout.<br/><br/>What is Renegade Scout? Other than 206 pages jammed full of gaming goodness?<br/><br/>This is a set of science fiction miniatures rules aimed at not only recapturing the spirit and feel of old school science fiction gaming, but presenting it in an updated and improved form, combining familiar mechanics with the polish and elegance expected in a modern game.<br/><br/>Using this system, you can command everything from tentacle aliens to squads of futuristic troopers, tanks, walkers, dinosaurs and more. Rules include off-map support, supernatural powers and a host of strange terrain features and world conditions to fight among.<br/><br/>If you are looking to revive some of your favorite old miniatures, note that Renegade Scout is profile compatible with the two first editions of the most popular gothic scifi wargame, allowing troops and weapons to be used as is, but with sleeker and more elegant mechanics.<br/><br/>If you want a fully fledged space opera setting to dive into, you can explore the worlds of Unified Space, where a host of alien species battle for supremacy, from the blood-stained cyborg troops of the Converted to the proud K'Erin and mysterious Engineers.<br/><br/>If you want to just open the book and play, we include 8 Battle Scenarios ready to play with your own armies, as well as the Objective Battle letting you fight an unpredictable encounter with randomly generated objectives. <br/>Scenario driven gaming more your speed? An array of tools and mechanics cover everything from radio communications to barricading doors.<br/><br/>The Army Builder allows you to construct a huge range of forces for any of the included troop types, for pick-up games using an army list and a fully fledged points system lets you build your own custom forces.<br/><br/>Want something a bit bigger? Why not start a Persistent Game where your troops gain experience from battle to battle. Perfect for campaigns or league play.<br/><br/>In short, almost whatever it is you are into and whatever scale of miniatures you enjoy, Renegade Scout has something for you.<br/><br/>Note that this is a fully updated 2nd edition of the rules, featuring much expanded content, material from several supplements, brand new options and far more pick-up-and-play possibilities than before.<br/><br/>If you are an experienced player, please enjoy this new edition generously funded by the fan base.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "White Dragons - White dragons are much tougher that normal dragons. They have double the health (10) and do twice as much damage. In other words, Claws do 12 points, Wings do 10 points, Tails do 6 (and reroll), Jaws do a whopping 24 points! Even the Treasure is twice as much, allowing 2 units to promote. However, there is a price for this; a white dragon replaces 2 normal dragons and takes twice as much magic to summon. So in a 36-health game, you could either bring 2 normal dragons or 1 white dragon. Any color dragon summoning spell can summon a white dragon, however, it takes 14 points of magic instead of 7.

        "description": "Permute is an abstract strategy game inspired by the Rubik&rsquo;s Cube.  In Permute, two players take it in turns to twist 2x2 sets of pieces on the board, attempting to 'solve' together connected groups of their pieces.  The player who builds the bigger solved group wins the game &ndash; but at any time, the opponent can step in and twist your groups apart again!<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>Permute is played on a square board filled with orange and yellow playing pieces in an alternating checkerboard pattern.  Orange always plays first.  Players take it in turns to select a 2x2 area of the board, called a &lsquo;face&rsquo;, and twist the pieces within that area 90 degrees clockwise or counterclockwise, as if rotating the face of a 2x2 Rubik&rsquo;s Cube.  After twisting, the active player must flip over or &lsquo;bandage&rsquo; one of her pieces in that face; bandaged pieces may not be part of any more twisting moves for the remainder of the game.<br/><br/>Over the course of the game, the accumulating bandaged pieces eventually make any further twists impossible; at that point, the game is over.  Players then count up their largest connected ('solved') group of pieces of their colour; pieces only count as connected when they are horizontally or vertically adjacent.  The player with the largest solved group of pieces wins the game.  If the players are tied for the largest group, then the second-largest groups of each player are compared to determine the winner; if those are also tied, then the third-largest groups are compared; and so on.<br/><br/>Permute is a scalable game and can be played on any board size. <br/> Playing on a 12x12 board is recommended for casual play, and a 16x16 board for deeper strategic contests.  A typical game on a 12x12 board will last 40-50 turns; a 16x16 game will last 70-80 turns.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players take on the roles of members of a crew of space marauders looking to strip the station of valuable resources. Unfortunately, the station is not quite as abandoned as they had hoped. They will be faced with lurking dangers and struggling survivors. The goal of the game is to collect a determined amount of silicon from the ship and return to the hanger with the silicon before the game ends. There are variable play modes which allow players to compete against each other or to play cooperatively.<br/><br/>The game is played on square tiles with players drawing and placing tiles as they explore the ship. Players move and interact by playing cards. The game is broken into rounds with each player drawing a number of cards and performing a number of action during the round. Players take turns, performing actions one at a time. They have a chance to add new cards to their deck or hand each round or to gain additional actions.<br/><br/>While exploring the Andromeda, players will find resources such as crafting components, ammo, food and their true goal, silicon. They may also find survivors, dangerous threats or face random events. Interaction with survivors or threats are handled through a chit-pull system. Each player has a bag and a set of different markers, each with a different effect. Throughout the game, the cards they play will have them add markers to their bag to form a pool. When interacting with entities, they can play cards that let them draw markers from the pool in an attempt to cause different effects. Players may face hostile encounters or peaceful encounters. Each marker type has a different effect depending on the type of encounter.<br/><br/>In addition to interacting with entities encountered onboard, players can interact with one another. They can steal from or sabotage other players to take or force them drop any carried silicon.<br/><br/>Silicon Saga can be played by a group or by a single player. For solo play, the game can be played using the base game mode. The rules will also include additional solo player challenges.<br/><br/>",

Hoping to take advantage of these rumors and boost its image, your city is planning a contest: build a flying machine, and find someone foolish enough to fly it.<br/><br/>Now, you know a publicity stunt when you hear one, but the idea has intrigued you.  You may be a humble farmer, but you have assets that others may not- a working knowledge of mechanics, determination, a hard work ethic, and&hellip; animals.  Lots of animals.  A grin slowly spreads on your face. &ldquo;When pigs shall fly, they say,&rdquo; you mutter to yourself. &ldquo;Well then, let&rsquo;s take to the skies!&rdquo;<br/><br/>When Pigs Shall Fly is a family weight dice-drafting game in which players prepare for the city&rsquo;s flight contest by researching the importance of the various theories of flight, designing a flying craft, training a pig to pilot their craft, and improving their craft&rsquo;s materials to make it as light as possible.  Along the way, they must also try to generate publicity and utilize the other farm animals to help them in their quest for aviation greatness.  When the big day arrives, players will have a chance to see the fruits of their labor by flying their craft in the contest, and hopefully, become locally known as the farmer with their head in the clouds!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is published by the Endangered Alphabets Project, which strives to preserve the many writing systems of the world that are under threat of extinction, including the Mongolian alphabet.<br/><br/>The game is set at the time after Genghis Khan's death, when his successors wondered what form the huge Mongolian empire should have in the future. Should the nomadic culture be preserved? Should Mongols adapt to an urban culture?<br/><br/>Each player adheres to one such idea, asks the support of a deity and a totemic animal and begins to gather the assets that will help their idea to prevail. The game is divided into two phases. The first phase is mostly to gather assets and to attack other players to thwart their plans. Players can choose to play an attack card which the attacked player can defend against. The player of the weaker card will lose strength points which will make it harder to fulfill their tasks in phase two. Alternatively, players can pass or try to force a trade on another player. If they know about a card another player holds, they can ask for it in exchange for any other asset card.<br/><br/>In phase two of the game, players arrive at the great summer festival of Naadam. Here, they compete in three traditional Mongolian sports: archery, horse racing and wrestling. Winners are decided by adding asset modifiers to a player's strength. <br/>After a final round of trading or attacking, players reveal their collected assets and add their strength to determine the winner.<br/><br/>Rules will be included in English and Mongolian.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the ceremonial opening of the New York Grand Hotel the actress Monique Moreau is found dead in her suite. How could the opening celebration end so tragically?<br/><br/>New York, August 1962. Welcome to the city that never sleeps! Everybody who was anybody had come to Manhattan to celebrate the opening of the magnificent Grand Hotel &ndash; aspiring politicians, powerful industrialists and beautiful actresses. The largest luxury hotel in the United States was set on redefining the term &ldquo;five-star&rdquo;, and was also to be the crown jewel in the empire of Frederic Price. The hotel tycoon was one of the richest men in the country. Since his marriage to the actress D&oacute;ra Galor, he was now even better known than before.<br/><br/>The opening speeches were full of praise, and the guests ate and drank copious amounts from the five-course menu. The evening had all the hallmarks of an incredible coming-together of American high society. Once the official part of the event was over, the guests gathered for an exuberant cocktail party at the longest hotel bar in the entire city. But the evening took a tragic turn when the young actress Monique Moreau was found dead in the bathtub of her hotel suite late in the evening. The idea that the young woman, described by the media as the next D&oacute;ra Galor, would take her own life is rejected by everyone as incredible.<br/><br/>The police were informed immediately. But it will take the authorities hours to search the entire hotel and secure all the relevant evidence. You have all been requested to stay here in the lobby. Until the police have questioned everybody, you are all on your own in solving the mystery, asking the questions: what happened this evening? How could the opening celebration end so tragically?<br/><br/>What is a murder mystery game?<br/><br/>You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case. The objective of the game is to convict the perpetrator &ndash; one of the people sitting with you at the table. This can only be achieved if the players discuss the course of events amongst themselves and compare their experiences of what happened. But be careful: Each character (including you!) has their own dark secrets which they&rsquo;d be better off keeping to themselves.<br/><br/>You all gather in the wake of the crime and attempt to piece together your memories, with the aim of identifying the perpetrator. In each round, you recall more and more about the circumstances of the crime, as each round deals with a different period of time from the evening the crime was committed. At the end, everyone votes on who should be handed over to the police as the suspect.<br/><br/>Culinario Mortale is a highly interactive game. There are only a few rules, and no pre-prepared dialogue. The focus is on working through the puzzles and discussing the events together.<br/><br/>Alongside a well-structured game manual, each game contains game booklets for between five and eight characters (the number of players for each game can be found on the packaging and here on our website). In the game booklets, each guest will find their personal clues and a description of their role. Each game booklet also includes a brief overview of how the game works. As such, all players can jump right in. The support code included with your Culinario Mortale game will allow you to download the role descriptions in advance from our website in PDF format, and easily send them to your guests via email.<br/><br/>GAME CONTENT:<br/>1 Game Manual, 8 Game Booklets, 1 Incident Booklet (includes of prologue, incidents, solution), 8 name badges, 1 support code<br/><br/>&mdash; description from the publisher.<br/><br/>",

It allows players to fight actions from the whole period and across the whole world, from Japan to Europe and the Americas and from the Italian Wars to the Nine Years War.<br/><br/>This edition combines the 2002 edition of the rules with all three of the books of Army Lists and includes everything the wargamer needs to refight these battles in one single convenient volume.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the book<br/><br/>",

The Poles get their S35&rsquo;s, and they also get the 25TP medium tank with a long-barreled 75mm gun, the 14TP cavalry tank with a long-barreled 47mm gun, and the 10TP and 9TP light tanks: the armor you need to stomp the szkopy.<br/><br/>These are very good tanks for 1939; they&rsquo;re still pretty good in 1941, too. You get 24 new die-cut and silky-smooth playing pieces and new scenarios to use them in battle. The Germans can get the T34 shock two years early; the 25TP is just as capable a fighting machine as the legendary Hammer of the Proletariat (and it&rsquo;s crewed by Poles).<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

In this feel-good game, players compete to see who can spread the most global unity.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s currency is love and it is gained by performing at concerts. During a turn, the active player moves to spaces on the board to set up concerts, collect fans and place them on their concerts. The more fans at your concert, the more love you gain when you perform there. Players draft musicians with different abilities depending on which instrument they play. Musician's abilities must be used sparingly, as they fatigue after they perform. Players can use ganja to revive their band members.<br/><br/>Bob Marley is represented in the game and he gives options when you interact with him. Players may also strategically place Marley at one of their own concerts to prompt other players to attend. Two types of cards are gained that either give bonuses that may shift strategy, or give goals to achieve extra unity points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The end goal is to perform at the One Love concert where you cash in your love for unity. The game ends when all the unity tokens are collected. Then all players tally unity tokens and additional unity point bonuses to see who is the victor. But really, everybody wins in a world with a little more unity!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

If a player does not score at least 500 points in a turn, then the dice are passed to the next player to take a turn, and wait until their next turn to try again and get in the game. The 500 or more points necessary to begin are counted towards the 10,000 points goal.<br/><br/>Playing<br/><br/>The First Roll of a Turn<br/>Player rolls all six dice to begin a turn.  If one or more scoring dice are rolled, then at least  one set of scoring dice must be set aside before rolling the remaining dice.<br/><br/>Keep It or Roll Again?<br/>A player may stop after any roll which scores points, keep the points and pass the dice to the next player.  Or, a player may roll the remaining dice in an attempt to increase a score, but risks losing the total of the entire turn if no scoring dice are rolled.<br/>If all dice in a turn score points, then a player may continue the turn by rolling all six dice again, but if no scoring dice are rolled, then the player loses all points for that turn.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/>If a player reaches or exceeds 10,000 points, then all other players get one more turn in an attempt to beat the leading scorer's points.<br/><br/>",

But what were those treasures doing before the adventurers came along? How many aeons have passed, in silent darkness, since they were last used?<br/><br/>Artefact shifts the focus to the perspective of a single magical item, and its history as it passes through the hands of many different keepers. You&rsquo;ll feel the weight of time as the item is lost or abandoned again and again, the dust &amp; decay piling around it until it&rsquo;s found again by someone new.<br/><br/>It's a great way to spend an hour; sketching, world-building and storytelling in your own company. It's also a fantastic way to generate really unique items for tabletop games like D&amp;D, with detailed histories far more vivid than any you'd typically find in a compendium.<br/><br/>",

Suitable for ages 9+.  As with the famous Trojan war told through Homer&rsquo;s Iliad, the game pits the Trojan army against the Achaean army that has traveled far and wide to reclaim their pride after Helen was taken from them.  The game includes a large number of the armies that are written about in the war and also many of the heroes and leaders in the battle such as Hector, Achilles, Agamemnon and Odysseus.  There is also the addition of the Greek gods that play their part.<br/><br/>Game play:  You take charge of either the Trojan or Achaean armies.  Defences are set up (both sides have four) and you make the decisions of which armies to defend the wall/stockade.  Then you have the option to level your armies up to make them stronger, choose a leader to improve their abilities or attack the opposing armies.  Attacking is done through dice rolling strategy as armies have improved abilities when fighting specific enemies.  All armies have the ability to defend each attack and this is done through dice rolling.  The leader's capabilities can be even better if they are linked to their respective armies. There are also divinity cards which can be played at any time.  These can help to improve the strength of an attack of assist with defence rolls depending on their capability.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to defeat the enemy army in front of their defences and destroy their wall.  The first side to destroy all four levels of the defence of their opposition is the winner.<br/><br/>The solo version of the game follows a set of rules for your opposition to follow, using a simple numbered system.  Be prepared to not always win tough!<br/><br/>",

Important dates and anniversaries are ignored or forgotten, and family functions are avoided. Before long, the unfortunate lover begins to resent the beautiful game. In time, a strong hatred of Nuffle, and all his wonders, is fostered and domestic bliss becomes a thing of the past! Such was the case with Gretchen W&auml;chter, whose husband was utterly obsessed with Blood Bowl when they were still alive. The Necromancer and aspiring coach Dirk the Abhorrent turned the animosity Gretchen held for the game into a finely-honed weapon and unleashed her scorn against her rival players &ndash; the pitch has never been the same since.<br/><br/>The legendary 'Blood Bowl Widow' is a frighteningly solid Star Player, despite being wholly incorporeal. Gretchen's set of skills make it hard for your opponents to get their hands on her, robbing their momentum and frustrating even their Big Guys. She can be Induced to play for any Sylvanian Spotlight team, bolstering their defensive line and skipping right past their biggest players on offence.<br/><br/>This finely-detailed resin model is supplied in 7 pieces, and comes supplied with a 32mm Round Blood Bowl Base. You can find all the rules you need to use her in Blood Bowl &ndash; The Official Rules.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>The 2016 edition rules for this Star Player can be found in Blood Bowl (2016 Edition): 2019 Blood Bowl Almanac<br/><br/>",

Many of Quedlinburg's top physicians who previously scorned the plant as insignificant or even dangerous have recognized the economic potential of harnessing the species for human consumption. The coming days are uncertain for the future of the Locoweed, but only time will tell whether it is a miracle cure or just a flash in the pot.<br/><br/>Extra Loco is a fan-made Print&amp;Play expansion for the Quacks of Quedlinburg and its first expansion, the Herb Witches.

Fighting what became known as the key land battle of the Pacific War the marines beat back wave after wave of merciless attackers, their exploits drawing the attention of the world. Recreate the key battles of Alligator Creek and Edson's Ridge while scouting for enemy positions and hunting for Pistol Pete, the Japanese heavy artillery that shelled the Lunga Perimeter with impunity. Fight through historical locations such as the Matanikau River, Kokumbona Village and Koli Point. Command men such as William J. Whaling, the founder of the Scout-Sniper detachment that would eventually go on to become Marine Recon, and John Basilone, whose bravery defending Henderson Field saw him win the Medal of Honor. Meet Sir Jacob C. Vouza, the native who refused to give away American positions to his Japanese torturers despite being bayoneted numerous times and left to die, only to bite through his bindings and return to Marine lines quickly enough to warn them of the Japanese advance and win the Battle of the Tenaru.<br/><br/>Warfighter: WWII Expansion #65 &ndash; Guadalcanal #1  adds 56 cards to your Warfighter WWII Missions.<br/><br/>3 x PS<br/>2 x NPS<br/>2 x SQS<br/>2 x Skills<br/>3 x Equipment<br/>4 x Situations<br/>4 x Missions<br/>4 x Objectives<br/>12 x Locations<br/>20 x Japanese Hostiles<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cooperative Miniature Encounters in the Cthulhu Mythos.<br/><br/>Mythos Encounters is a miniature skirmish game of the Cthulhu Mythos. This is a cooperative game, in which Investigators work together to face the horrors of ruthless cultists, mysterious alien creatures and the elder gods themselves.<br/><br/>Your investigators can face enemies head-on, trusting in your strength and weaponry, or take a more subtle approach using stealth and gathering clues to gain an advantage.<br/><br/>Enemy creatures in Mythos Encounters change from encounter to encounter, and their behavior is determined by a variety of AI tactics.<br/><br/>As your investigators progress through each encounter, they will gain new abilities, equipment and allies that will allow them to face even greater threats. They may also gain permanent physical injuries or debilitating mental disorders.<br/><br/>Mythos Encounters is played as a series of linked encounters using your own terrain and miniature figures. This game has no official terrain or miniatures.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Red Cloaks are the Lannister's elite guards that patrol the streets in both King's Landing and Casterly Rock. Their resplendent red cloaks, their signature feature, is colored not just because it's a House color, but as a show of intimidation to the populace. &quot;Stay in line, or the Red Cloaks will come after you&quot;.<br/><br/>The unit box A Song of Ice &amp; Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game &ndash; Lannister Red Cloaks gives House Lannister players a new medium infantry unit for their force. The Red Cloaks are armored in half-plate, the best that money can buy for mass production. This gives them a modicum of defense, able to turn away blows from all but the strongest enemy soldiers. Being paid well also serves them on the battlefield, as they know they don&rsquo;t want to lose that next paycheck.<br/><br/>",

You and your fellow treasure hunters compete for the most treasure, entering from different corners of the large hexagonal map.<br/><br/>To be victorious, you must make it out of the map with health remaining and the most victory points found on artifact, treasure and item cards. With a limited hand size, you'll need to balance Treasure and Artifacts with the item cards you'll need to get out alive. Navigate through the twisted corridors of the 65 hexagonal map tiles to get to the center where the most treasure lies. Each tile will either present a hazard or a trap sprung by an event card drafted by a player on their turn.<br/><br/>After choosing an event card, players will have one free action per turn, choose to either gather treasure or item cards, heal or move through the map revealing new tiles. On every cave-in event the lowest numbered tile is removed from the map. To hasten your escape, you may wish to trade a health for a second action. If you're not fast enough to be the first one out, you'll find yourself racing to find an exit as the map begins to disintegrate at an accelerated rate.<br/><br/>You may be close to making it out, but managing your health to prevent your elimination may slow you down as you stare down at a pit hazard with no rope item card, but then again, how far are the other treasure hunters? Are there any dangers in the upcoming event cards? Is there a week tile about to cave in on your path? Can you take the loss of health by entering the tile?

Whoever rearranges a sequence of cards first, tells a story inspired by the images and the structure sheet.   Who has more imagination?<br/><br/>The structure cards are placed in the center of the table in order from 1 to 5: these will provide the players with the guide for the construction of the stories.  The dealer shuffles the inspiration cards and arranges them face down and scattered on the table.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to conquer a succession of cards from 1 to 5. In turn, starting with the player to the right of the dealer, each draws a card from the table until he has 5 cards each (uncovered in front of him).  If no one has a sequence from 1 to 5, the game continues: each player, in turn, draws a new map and discards one in his possession, placing it face down on the table.  If a player rolls a series of 1 to 5, stop the game and try to tell a story by connecting the 4 images with the final map and using the structure cards as a template (on the back of each there is a short description for each phase of the  story that helps the player to create the tale).  After telling the story, the other players give a score from 1 to 10 to the narrator (the votes add up and form the score of each narrator; the scores can be written on a sheet of paper).  he used blankets on the bench randomly and draws five more.  The game continues in the same way with the player to the right of the last narrator.  Whoever gets to 100 points first (or more or less at the choice of the players) wins.

Every dice showing a &quot;7&quot; or higher is a success and compared to a difficulty number. If the number of success is equal to or higher than the difficulty number, the task resolved successfully.<br/><br/>Players build their force from a point value determined by the scenario.

Remember which seeds you've planted and manage your hand to put out the pots and plants you need. This small card game combines spatial card placement with memory, variable goals, and deductive elements to create a unique challenge each time you play.<br/><br/>Players shuffle 2 decks and build a 4x4 grid by playing cards one at a time. Players have multiple goals they can pick to win the game.  This is made more difficult as some cards are played upside down so they remain hidden til the end of the game for scoring.<br/><br/>My Small Garden combines memory and strategy in a quick little card game.<br/><br/><br/>",

Will the Holy Roman Emperor remain on his throne? Which side of this enormous conflict will the nations of Europe choose? And will Poland survive the Swedish deluge?<br/><br/>Raison d&rsquo;Etat is a board game for 1-7 players. It is a standalone expansion for Coalitions, with its own distinct game board and seven playable nations (Poland, Sweden, Britain, France, Spain, Austria, and the Ottoman Empire) included in the box. Unlike other expansions for Coalitions, you do not need the base game of Coalitions to play Raison d&rsquo;Etat. It comes with all the components, rules and scenarios necessary to play.<br/><br/>Players engage in an exciting area control game of shifting alliances and coalitions, of intense back-stabbing, diplomacy and bold military actions set in an era defined by the upheaval of the Thirty Years&rsquo; War and the Polish-Swedish Wars. As in the Coalitions&rsquo; core game, Raison d'Etat&rsquo;s uses the Wheel of War mechanic to virtually eliminate downtime, while the innovative Activator system introduces a new level of dynamic interactions between the players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Work together to reach clues in time and secure them at Canine P.D. to earn points and solve the caper of the day.<br/><br/>Clues will pop up around the village based on the outcomes of dice rolls. Players roll dice to determine their 'paw points' for that turn. Using these they traverse the board, pick up, drop off, give, take clues and even increase the value of their clues.<br/><br/>It's a race to get to clues before a new one would be generate in that spot as if the previous clue is still on the board the new clue will be stolen by a sneaky cat and taken away to their toy chest. Not to worry, with a bit of help from the sly foxes on the board you can enhance other clues by swapping them with higher value clues from the toy chest.<br/><br/>Special Actions linked to each number on the die allow players extra abilities that can allow for diagonal movement, enhance clues, move a clue, jump to home, swap two clues on the board or return clues to the resource pool, which can extend your playing time as once the resource pools are empty it's time to take your final turn then tally up your points to see if you've won this time!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fisheries of Gloucester Express is an &quot;express&quot; version of Fisheries of Gloucester. It consists of 24 ocean cards, 1 ship card, 8 bucket cards, and 5 rule cards.<br/><br/>At the game's start, both players have 1 bucket to put fish into. The ocean is a 5x5 grid of ocean cards, with the center space occupied by the ship. On your turn, you move the ship and pick up a card. On the first turn, both players may move only 1 space (from card to card). However, the card you pick up tells you how many spaces you may move on your next turn.<br/><br/>Some ocean cards allow you to pick up more bucket cards. The bucket cards have various scoring conditions (based on different kids of sets).  Also, some ocean cards allow you to upgrade a bucket -- to give it more capacity and more scoring power.<br/><br/>After all cards are picked up, the buckets are scored and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Time is short, resources are scarce and heroes are desperately needed.<br/><br/>Perpetuity: Grave Descent is a science fiction worker placement game for 1-5 players and plays Cooperatively, Competitively and Solo. Each round players place workers on work tiles to collect resources, repair damaged tiles, upgrade tiles, build ships and eventually fly missions to evacuate alien villages on the dying planets.  Players must navigate a quickly changing game where lower level workers become less effective.  Players must balance choices between keeping systems operational and spending limited resources on ships and rescue missions.<br/><br/>&quot;Perpetuity&quot; itself (the artificial star) can be played by one of the players or a set of A.I. cards.  Perpetuity in both cases works against the other players and attempts to hinder their evacuation efforts by unlocking abilities in Gravity, Space, Time and Matter.<br/><br/>In Cooperative play, players race to save all the alien villages and workers.  If any are lost when a planet is destroyed, the game ends in failure.<br/><br/>In Competitive play, players vie for the most victory points by maximizing opportunities for points with repairs, exploration, evacuations and collecting resources.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fast paced, action, battle royale game where you face off against 1 to 3 opponents incorporating characters from the Persona video game's universe and power them up using any standard 54 deck of playing cards! Activate special skills and be the last one standing to win!<br/><br/>Players take turns drafting heroes (from the 17 character cards included in the box) that they will use to battle their opponents. Each player shuffles a 54 card standard playing card deck (sold separately) and draws a starting hand equal to the value printed on their current character. They also draw cards equal to that character's LIFE value. Players will then pick one card from their hand to represent their starting POWER (1-10 cards have power equivalent to their numbers, while Jacks, Queens and Kings equal a power value of 11,12 and 13 respectively).<br/><br/>Players then take turns playing different suits and numbered cards in specific combinations to activate their character's own unique battle skills. These skills will either allow you to charge up your current battle power value even further, increase the rate of damage dealt to losing players at the end of the round, or any number of special abilities (like drawing more cards or dealing instant damage to an opponent).<br/><br/>Once all players PASS, everyone counts up who has the current highest power value. That player wins that round, dealing damage to every other player, equivalent to the current rate of damage! Those players must discard life cards equal to the damage rate. If a hero loses all of it's health, that player must switch to one of their reserve heroes. When all of your opponents heroes have been reduced to 0 health, you win the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This free for Kickstarter backers expansion introduces 6 special non-aligned generals who broadly represent the rulers of minor non-playable European kingdoms and duchies. These generals control certain scenario-designated territories at the beginning of the game. Any nation who captures one of these territories will be able to employ its general as if it were their own &ndash; at least as long as the said territory is garrisoned by that nation.<br/><br/>The expansion could potentially change the balance of power in Europe, granting nations such as Prussia or Austria access to additional and much-needed generals. But will that be enough to offset the French military superiority? Quite possibly!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In the shootout, either party may be arrested / withdrawn or killed depending on the dice rolls and modifier cards played.<br/>You also have to discover and dismantle the distillery tiles, playing the appropriate cards or detect the situation of the secret police station tiles to avoid their controls.<br/>The cards also allow moving the control barriers that close some of the exits of the city, both to one team and another.<br/>The smugglers and thieves achieve their objective as soon as they manage to leave the city and obtain the corresponding economic reward.<br/>The policemen achieve their objectives by preventing the cars from leaving the city, arresting or killing them, and dismantling distilleries.<br/>The game ends when half of the gangsters' troops disappear (cars and / or tiles) or when they manage to accumulate a predetermined amount of money.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cross Bronx Expressway is the third game in the Irregular Conflicts Series. It simulates the socio-economic processes of urban development, and the human costs that result, as a competitive city-builder with collective loss conditions. Players control one of three asymmetric factions working in the South Bronx between 1940 and 2000, pursuing their own goals while cooperating to keep the borough viable. Through a card driven sequence of play, they will work to solve the economic challenges facing the area by building infrastructure and organizations, forming coalitions, mitigating the multitude of issues facing the vulnerable population, and managing resources to stay out of debt. Cross Bronx Expressway offers an engaging way to learn about the recent history of American cities, as exemplified by Jane Jacobs&rsquo; pivotal work The Death and Life of Great American Cities, simulated through the case study of the South Bronx. Players will experience the conflicting incentives and complex factors shaping urban life, and together determine the fate of the Bronx.<br/><br/>The gameplay is driven by a deck of event cards which determines turn order, and then players spend resources to take actions on map spaces. The game ends after the event deck is exhausted, or earlier if certain conditions are met. Players score victory points at regular periods during the game, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins (unless an auto-loss condition for all players is met).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You are investigating the disappearance of Professor Daffle, the world's leading researcher of Cryptozoology, as you travel to legendary locations like The Himalayas and Roswell, New Mexico. You are also in constant peril of getting lost in the Bermuda Triangle!<br/><br/>Rumors and Legends is a light game that can be learned in 10-15 minutes and takes around 30-45 minutes on average to play. You'll find the mechanics comfortably familiar if you have played the usual suspects of mystery games before, but a host of new twists and turns to make the game feel unique, modern and thematically interesting.<br/><br/>A player rolls the dice to determine their next move. Their move may involve moving their mini a specified number of spaces, drawing a Rumor card, moving the door minis, and/or moving to the Bermuda Triangle to end the turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player is first to solve the mystery of Professor Daffle's disappearance. There are three components: the Creature responsible, the Location of Daffle's disappearance, and the Incident that was involved.<br/><br/>The player who is able to solve the three components of the mystery is the one who wins the game.<br/><br/>",

You start by placing a primary producer/Base Card to create a new habitat. Each animal card will list what it can eat leading up to an apex predator. Each new habitat is connected as the game goes on, but with human projects such as roads and housing estates these habitats can become disconnected. Animals that could once be moved are now trapped. You must strategically place your animals, human projects and natural events to thwart your opponents.<br/><br/>The game mechanics have been designed to practically demonstrate how humans are causing issues but also how we can help in a simple and family friendly game lasting 25 - 45min.<br/><br/>Each animal card will also feature data about that animal so you can learn things like their weight, population size/trend as well as where they fall on the endangered species list.<br/>In the rules you'll also find a list of organisations that are working hard to protect our natural world.<br/><br/>The first player to place all their cards wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Take turns dividing up your Halloween haul and claim the piles that will score you the most points! As you collect your favorite candies, you'll also gain bonuses and tricky abilities to help you get the tastiest mix at the end of the night!<br/><br/>This roll-and-write game uses an &quot;I Split, You Choose&quot; mechanic and takes around 15 minutes for 1-3 players to enjoy.<br/><br/>To setup, give everyone a scoresheet and a writing utensil. Then, pick one of the colors to be your &quot;secret color&quot; and write it on the back of the scoresheet. You will score this color twice during scoring. Now you are ready to roll!<br/><br/>Each round, one player will roll all six dice and divide them into a number of piles equal to the number of players. Then, starting with the next player, everyone will take a pile of dice, leaving the player who split them up to take the last pile. Everyone then writes the die values from their piles in their matching color column and then starts a new round.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has completely filled two columns. All values are then added up, bonuses are counted, and the person with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Look at the back of the card to check if you were right. If you were right, keep the card and pass on the pile to the next player. If you were wrong put the card underneath the pile and pass it on.

Units represent battalions grouped into brigades. Maneuver and attacks in the game are done via actions played from a deck of cards, and each pass through the deck represents 2 days and nights of fighting. A game of Caucasus Burning: The Nagorno-Karabahk War, 2020 will probably take a little less than 10 passes through the deck, so it will run a little faster than the actual war.<br/><br/>",

You must choose where and how to focus your warriors' actions and control the battle&rsquo;s impetus. The battle is partly fought on the tabletop like other miniature wargames but is also fought just as hard on the Tactics Chart, providing an additional mind-game against your opponent.<br/><br/>Command your units to move and fight in the areas of the battlefield you wish, but leave the actual process of fighting to your units' commanders. This is represented by the random factor of dice and each of your units&rsquo; abstract but often-decreasing Battle Rating. Because of this, your focus is kept where it should be &ndash; out-thinking your opponent by using superior tactics and exploiting their weaknesses on the battlefield.<br/><br/>Age of Penda is not intended as a heavy simulation of medieval warfare but as an enjoyable, simple, and fast-playing battle game themed around seventh-century warfare.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll find that much of the action is stylized and streamlined. Don&rsquo;t think of &ldquo;turns&rdquo; in the usual wargaming way &ndash; in each turn your units may fight or move several times, countered by your opponent after every action, creating a very fluid game but at the same time making cohesive planning difficult to achieve.<br/><br/>",

Bots can be coded to move using Navigation control cards but watch out! - the Scientist's Navigation System only gives limited navigation cards. Use logic loops to build logic into the Bots to move around obstacles (which include the Scientist's pets!).

        "description": "Card game IQ Ring: No. 2 is an educational question-and-answer game. The game consists of a set of 90 cards with questions, 12 special cards to track the score, 4 player figures, 8 surprise cards and an answer book. Each question card contains 3 questions of different difficulty. The first question is worth 1 point, the second 2 points and the third 3 points.<br/>The game progresses in a clockwise direction. First, the question and surprise cards are shuffled into one deck. The player on the left then draws the card. If it is a question card - the player chooses one of the 3 questions and tries to answer it. If the answer is correct, the player goes as far as the question was worth. If incorrect, stay standing or go back if indicated on a special card. If the surprise card is pulled out, what is written on it is executed. The winner is the one who first scores 12 points.<br/>This game can be expanded with IQ Ring: No. 1 and IQ Ring: No. 3 cards.<br/><br/>Kortelių žaidimas &quot;IQ ringas: Nr. 2&quot; &ndash; tai lavinamasis edukacinis klausimų ir atsakymų žaidimas. Žaidimą sudaro 90 kortelių rinkinys su klausimais, 12 specialiųjų kortelių skirtų rezultatui sekti, 4 žaidėjų figūrėlės, 8 netikėtumo kortelės ir atsakymų knygelė. Kiekvienoje klausimų kortelėje yra po 3 skirtingo sudėtingumo klausimus. Pirmas klausimas vertas 1 ta&scaron;ko, antras &ndash; 2, trečias &ndash; 3 ta&scaron;kų.<br/>Žaidimo eiga vyksta laikrodžio rodyklės kryptimi. Pirmiausia yra sumai&scaron;omos klausimų ir netikėtumo kortelės į vieną kaladę. Tuomet kairėje esantis žaidėjas traukia kortelę. Jei tai klausimų kortelė - žaidžiantysis pasirenka vieną i&scaron; 3 klausimų ir bando į jį atsakyti. Jei atsakymas teisingas, žaidėjas paeina tiek, kiek vertas buvo klausimas. Jei neteisingas, lieka stovėti vietoje arba eina atgal jei taip yra nurodyta specialioje kortelėje. Jei yra i&scaron;traukiama netikėtumo kortelė, vykdoma tai, kas joje para&scaron;yta. Laimi tas, kuris greičiausiai surenka 12 ta&scaron;kų.<br/>&Scaron;į žaidimą galima praplėsti su &quot;IQ ringas: Nr. 1&quot; ir &quot;IQ ringas: Nr. 3&quot; kortomis.<br/><br/>",

Then he turns the card over to see what instructions he has to follow. This are fairly predictable; Miss a turn perhaps, roll the die and move backwards, and so on. The player then takes the card and keeps it in front of him where all the players can see it. The card will have a value ranging from 5 to 30, with the value being commensurate with the penalty value of the instruction on it. If a subsequent player lands on a numbered field that has already been taken, then he treats the space as a normal space without number.<br/><br/>When the numbered space 30 has been reached, that player has finished.

When the bids are shown, the highest bid chooses an instrument first, then the next highest bid and so on.<br/><br/>The players decks have different sets of numbers, and every instrument card in the game is unique.<br/><br/>There are seven kinds of instruments, appearing in four colours. The more different instruments a player gathers, the more points they score. But after scoring, they must discard the most cards in one colour. So by gathering diverse colours, they can quickly reform their band and score again.<br/><br/>Scoring occurs at the end of each round (a jam session).<br/><br/>If a player gets all seven types of instrument into their hand, they instantly win the game.

Equipped with two G7e Torpedoes, the Seehund was designed as a short range commerce raider for deployment in the North Sea.<br/><br/>The game play is divided into two games, which are connected to each other. You will start with the Strategic Game, which is played on a geographic map of the British Channel and it surrounding coasts. Here you will be at risk of encountering different events and challenges while searching for<br/>convoys to attack. Once you find a convoy, the Strategic Game pauses, and you switch to the Tactical Game, which is played on a large map, which is centered around the encountered convoy. You will try to maneuver as close a possible to identify the individual vessels<br/>and pick the biggest fish. For torpedo simulation, the game uses a simplified mechanism, which allows you to attack from any angle and any range with minimal restrictions. Once there is no more to achieve against this convoy, you will try to escape the scene by grounding your submarine on the seafloor and hoping for the best.<br/><br/>After your escape, play will continue with the Strategic Game, where you can now choose to continue your journey, or head back to the home harbor of IJmuiden. Once you reach harbor, the game comes to a happy ending. But don&rsquo;t be fooled, as there is only one happy end, and a dozen ways to die in the cold waters of the North Sea.<br/><br/>",

Strong, tough, and decidedly deadly, the House&rsquo;s sigil fits well with the troops that they field in war. For example, thought the unit known as the Bruisers are not highly armed or armored, no foe wants to see them on the other side of a battlefield. Their tenacity means that they don&rsquo;t stop fighting until the very last one of them is cut down.<br/><br/>The House Mormont Bruisers Unit Box for House Stark in the A Song of Ice and Fire: Tabletop Miniatures Game gives players a rough and tumble melee unit for their forces. They eschew heavy armor and shields in exchange for raw attacking power, enough that their ferocity even shows through when defending. Their light shields are equipped with a punching spike, letting them be on the offensive even when on the defensive. Enemies must be wary of missed attacks when going after the Bruisers.<br/><br/>",

Reveal is a dynamic and engaging board game with a difference: there are no questions, only answers!<br/><br/>Reveal can be played as individuals or in teams and the object of the game is to guess the hidden movie, TV show and song titles to gain medals and walk the red carpet to be crowned Champion of the Titles.<br/><br/>The answer card is loaded into the Reveal card sleeve and then the card is pulled out to reveal only the first letter of each of the words in the title. The player then has two guesses, or 30 seconds, to correctly name the title and win three medals. An incorrect guess will result in the second letter of each of the title words being revealed but the quicker the title is guessed the more medals that are won! Once a player has scooped 15 medals it is time to head for the winner&rsquo;s square at the centre of the board via any of the Red Carpet routes. In order to be crowned the ultimate Champion of the Titles a player must solve one final title from a category chosen by an opponent!<br/><br/>",

After performing their actions, any supply crates that currently exist within a player's supply chain will move according to their capacity.  After cargo crates have moved along the supply line, players end their turn by building additional supply crates at any and all factories the player has constructed.<br/><br/>Once a player has successfully delivered 25 crates from their factories to the center tile (City tile) they win the game!<br/><br/>",

Players can choose cards to add to their panel, or to improve the way their panel scores. Balancing the choices is a challenge.<br/><br/>The game has a set of score cards laid out in a column, and panel cards depicting various Egyptian characters laid alongside each score card. As players take panel cards, they place their own cubes on the scoring section of the score card.<br/><br/>When a player takes a new panel card, it is placed at either end of their display, or between existing cards. But players cannot shuffle the cards around as they like.<br/><br/>The panels depict various figures, some holding decorated items, some showing their eyes, some facing to the left or right. As the panel builds up, players want to optimise their scoring with the right panels in the right place.<br/><br/>Some scoring cards have limits that must be exceeded or restricted, such as more than 3 of one image, or fewer than 7. Some cards have very particular scoring, such as create a line of mummy, eye, eye, woman. The mix of figures on the panels and the mix of scoring needs creates a difficult choice for players.<br/><br/>The game is played over two rounds, and the player with the highest score at the end is the winner.<br/><br/>The second edition had some tweaks to the rules and the card contents to improve gameplay.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

While inspired by the clever mechanisms of Pax Viking, Vendel to Viking includes some significant differences in the game system as well as taking players back to the centuries prior to the Viking era. In Vendel to Viking, you are immersed in Nordic culture between 550 to 800 CE as you build your family&rsquo;s legacy with every turn.<br/><br/>You represent a family in one of the Nordic cultures that evolves into one of the prominent families of the Viking era. Each turn represents a generation and you seek to include the best formidable persons in your family as you evolve from generation to generation. You place family members on the map and use them for accessing different effects in various locations, such as worker actions or for even elevating them into a formidable person. When elevated to status, the family member is linked to a character card taken from a market and moved to an achievement tree. The Character goes to your family board and both their presence in the achievement tree and on the family board affects your family&rsquo;s opportunities for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>You must plan well before the centuries run out! The first to hold two Future-level achievements in the achievement tree wins. If no player manages to do so before a set number of turns, the one with the most points wins.<br/><br/>In addition to having a robust Solo Mode, the end state of Vendel to Viking will interface with the starting state of a game of Pax Viking making it possible to play the two games as a Campaign.<br/><br/>",

Play the best antibiotic to kill the most pathogens with the fewest side effects. There are two decks of cards: Bug Cards (bacteria and syndromes) and Drug Cards (antibiotics). Each player uses Drug Cards to slay Bug Cards which slowly fill up a 3 x 3 playing area. If you successfully match an effective Drug to a susceptible Bug you get to keep matching and killing more. If you fail, play moves on to the next player, and the Bug Card may become more resistant. Each drug has its own side effects and flora costs, though, so choose your Drug Cards wisely. Guess wrong too many times and the 3 x 3 playing area will be overwhelmed. If that happens you lose a life. Game ends when either the players survive the Bug Card onslaught and complete the Bug Card deck or all players lose all their lives.<br/><br/>Solo and versus modes, varying levels of difficulty, and expert scoring options are also available.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Straight of the box it combines some fairly average stats, but with a little work the T-70 can shine in any situation with specific upgrades available for the gun and engine.<br/><br/>The T-70 adds another Light Tank to the mix. Built in large numbers by the Soviet army it is a blank canvas ready for commanders to tweak to meet their mission needs. It comes with relatively high initiative (for a Soviet vehicle) but this can be improved through use of the M-80 engine which enhances the tanks initiative in the movement phase &ndash; it also works on the SU-76 and SU-122A (spoilers!). As a Light Tank the T-70 doesn&rsquo;t necessarily have the highest number of hit points or defense but a Low Noise System has the potential to give a light tank a nice defensive buff, if the dice are on your side.<br/><br/>",

Based on the epic 1930 Himalayan adventure which ultimately failed to climb the third highest peak in the world, the game uses original photos and draws on Frank Smythe's book The Kangchenjunga Adventure, written almost 100 years ago.<br/><br/>In the first part of the game the players recruit climbers and sherpas, and gather a range of other resources. These are all represented on the cards. This calls for a mixture of set-building and push-your-luck, as you aim to bring together the strongest expedition possible. Although the game is competitive, there are ways of helping each other too.<br/><br/>The second part of the game sees the players making their final preparations for an assault on the summit of Kangchenjunga. Some cards may not be useable if the set isn't correct. Then the summit attempt begins and players take it in turns to advance up the mountain. Kangchenjunga is 28,156 feet tall, and successful players must achieve this. But whatever the outcome, details of the players' expeditions can be recorded in the 'Hall of Fame' at the back of the Almanac.<br/><br/>Kangchenjunga works beautifully as a 'filler' game for a wide range of ages. Simple to learn, the game-play has surprising depths and re-playability is high. See the Rulebook and Almanac link below for full details of how the game plays.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Borik&eacute;n &mdash; that is, modern-day Puerto Rico &mdash; is now home to a people that proudly trace their heritage back to its Ta&iacute;no, African, and Spanish roots. These three different cultures were brought together by some of the worst measures of the human condition &mdash; greed, slavery, and genocide &mdash; but the result is a vibrant culture, rich with history and traditions, and known for its beauty and passion.<br/><br/>The Ta&iacute;no people are gone, but they live on through the people who are trying to connect the broken pieces of their culture almost five hundred years later. To that end, this game tells the story of Borik&eacute;n through the eyes of the Ta&iacute;no people, a people who existed and faced their own challenges even before the Spanish arrived on their shores (pre-1493), who rallied together to try to rid their home of the overwhelming invaders (1493-1512), and in failing to do so had to make hard sacrifices so that a few might survive (1512-1529).<br/><br/>In designing and developing Borik&eacute;n: The Ta&iacute;no Resistance, we decided that in an effort to convey a holistic picture of the Ta&iacute;no people, no part of their story could be left out, so the campaign game combines three unique scenarios, each covering one of the three eras of Ta&iacute;no history, focusing on the type of conflict in which the Ta&iacute;no people were engaged.<br/><br/>These three game scenarios can be played individually as standalone games or played as a three-part campaign in which the end state of each game serves as the set up for the next. Each game scenario accommodates 2-4 players and takes between 45-90 minutes to play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In this cyber-punk worker-placement game, each player controls a team of Shadow Runners that they can send on missions, loan to other players (for a fee, of course), and upgrade with new tech and equipment. Missions are resolved by rolling combinations of custom dice. A diverse team of Shadow Runners gives you access to more combinations of dice, and your upgrades add even more dice to your pool. Take on smaller missions to earn creds. Then, put those right back into more experienced runners, and better gear. Once you think you've got what it takes, send your runners out to attempt to collect one final score. If you fail, don't worry, your doc-wagon contracts will keep your runners in the game. The first player to successfully complete the final mission, and collect that last big score wins the game!<br/><br/>This Kickstarter Collection Includes:<br/><br/>Legendary Base Game<br/>Kickstarter Co-Op Exclusive Expansion<br/>All Kickstarter Stretch Goals<br/>Kickstarter Map Boards<br/>Kickstarter Boards Included:<br/><br/>Toronto<br/>Neo-Tokyo<br/>Berlin<br/><br/>",

Far more important to the Axis cause than Midway Island, Japanese control of the chokepoint at the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb would have broken British communications with India, Australia and New Zealand except for the lengthy and difficult route around the Cape of Good Hope, and made the entire campaign in North Africa superfluous.<br/><br/>Eastern Fleet: Gulf of Aden is a Campaign Study in the same format as Midway: Rising Sun 1940 or Coral Sea: Defending Australia, with 14 scenarios depicting a Japanese campaign in Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea opposed by the British Eastern Fleet, heavily reinforced to defend this vital maritime crossroads.

There are endless possibilities! Cooperative 3D construction game.<br/><br/>Floor cards are placed on the table, and 5 floors are dealt to each player. The player on the right begins to build, who will have to build according to what the card indicates. If you will have to use short or long twig cards, if you have to balance some nest boxes or if you have to receive a message from the homing pigeon. Once that stage is resolved, you will have to roll the dice and see how many floors you have to go up or down with your little bird. So continue the other players. The game ends when the roof card is drawn or when there are no more floors left.<br/><br/>",

Silver bars in the branches generate investment income at the end of each round. Silver bars in the head office can also be loaned to generate income.<br/><br/>In addition, players can make foreign exchange transfers between the branches and the head office. This allows you to earn commissions on money orders and to invest your bullion until maturity.<br/><br/>You can also strengthen your branch by staffing it with personnel or paying money to the government office to obtain privileges.<br/><br/>Dice Placement<br/><br/>Each player rolls a die each round and places the rolled die on the action square. The player with the higher die roll gets to act first, while the player with the lower die roll gets more powerful effects.<br/><br/>If a die is placed on a square already occupied by another die, the player pays the difference if the die is smaller than the previous die, and receives the difference if the die is larger. A die cannot be placed on a square with the same number of dice as the one already placed on it.<br/><br/>The essence of finance, right here!<br/><br/>Heiho&quot; is a game that successfully incorporates the essence of the financial business, such as money management and foreign exchange transfer, into a game.<br/><br/>The silver bars and copper coins are made of metal, and the components have also been carefully designed.<br/><br/>",

Along the broad Danube River, the Austrian flotilla fought to keep their Serbian enemies from pushing upstream into the heart of the Monarchy.

        "description": "Two additional tank types for Tank Chess: Ultra-heavy Tank and Armed Off-road vehicle.<br/><br/>The Ultra-heavy Tank (UT) is the strongest and the slowest vehicle. Its max speed is only 1 and its armor values are V, IV and III. On the front, it has a turrent with a double-barreled gun that shoots in three directions and has a value of V and in the back there is a smaller turret with another cannon (III) that shoots in three directions backwards. Like the Twin-gun Tank, the UT can also shoot at two targets simultaneously. On top of that, being a heavy means that it can destroy tree-type obstacles.<br/><br/>The Armed Off-road vehicle (AO) is the fastest piece in the game (max. 7 speed). The AO movement is different from the other pieces: it does not lose movement steps due to turning. Because of this, it can move even further, but at the same time it cannot rotate in place. Therefore, in each step this piece can move to a square that is right in front or to the squares that are left or right to that square.<br/>When moving backwards, just like any other piece, Armed Off-road vehicle can only move once to the square that is right behind. But in this situation it may also turn at 45 degrees simultaneously (left or right).<br/>The AO does not have any armour (0, 0, 0), and it has a recoilless gun that can shoot only right in front due to the mounting. The gun is weak(it has a value of I) and its range is limited to 5 squares (even though it can shoot over obstacles), which is another distinctive feature.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rules<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Coupling, the Game is The ultimate party game in which you will discover more about your friends in 45 minutes than you did in your whole life, AND have a blast at the same time! It's a game for stronger friendships, deep conversations and a fun evening, with a healthy amount of competition, lots of laughter, a pinch of tickling and, for the most playful, a bit of singing and dancing.<br/><br/>The basic version of the game contains 10 mini-games on 120 COUPLING cards, which, combined with unique mechanics, make a highly dynamic game. More than 500 combinations of questions and challenges break even the toughest ice and ensure that the game is still fun even after you play it with the same group of friends for the tenth time.<br/><br/>You play the game in three stages:<br/><br/>     Like in life, every player starts out as single. Then, through random questions and fun personal stories, you couple up with two players.<br/>     These two players now compete for your affection in the second stage through exciting challenges: charades with sounds, mouth reading, recipes and geometric shapes and lines. <br/>     In the third stage, it&rsquo;s Couples Showdown, where each player competes along with their best partner for a glorious victory against other couples through new mini games: multiple choice cards to challenge your beliefs, personal questions that you may have always wanted to talk about, but didn't dare ask, psychological pictures to see what&rsquo;s beyond obvious, and drawing things and associations to release your inner Picasso. <br/><br/><br/>First couple to get through the FINISH LINE wins and gets to sit in the glorious winning spot!<br/><br/>Two players can use the cards to get to know each other better. Additional blank cards can be purchased to expand the game to 12 players.<br/><br/>",

Players only have a few turns to get in, secure their haul, and extract their spoils on a collapsing asteroid. Strange Orbit features a tactile world composed of hexagonal resource tiles, which ensures that each game's layout is unknown and requires crafty exploration using each character's unique abilities. The player who collects the most valuable haul after the asteroid collapses is deemed the winner.<br/><br/>On each turn, players receive 10 action points to move, climb, build, deposit, and disrupt other players on a living board that is constantly changing shape. Players search the board for valuable minerals such as gold, emeralds, and diamonds in order to extract and deposit in their personal stashes. Be careful however, as players must be careful around other players who may attempt to steal or destroy their resources.<br/><br/>In Strange Orbit, players will take on the role of a Triffling crew member on The Big Rig, a staging vessel for descents into the dangerous caverns of the asteroids. Due to hefty commissions and the Triffling's quarrelsome nature, miners will compete to be the one with the most glittering gems and gold. Pushing, stealing, or even undercutting the gem market are all tools for the miners to swing fortune in their favor. Don't be the one to dawdle too long, as the unstable cavern formations are soon to collapse into rolling magma!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Greenrock Village: A small town never rests.<br/><br/>After the series of murders was finally cleared up in the local municipal theater, it seemed as if the community would be able to go about their daily business without worries. But that shouldn't last long, because a new horrific series of murders interrupts the short period of calm. Who murdered the owner? Was it Mrs. Kunz? Or Mr. M&uuml;ller? Someone is up to mischief in the allotment gardens. In each of the five gardens there is an object that could have served as a murder weapon. Owners and visitors visit these gardens at different times. But one of them thinks less about gardening or relaxing...<br/><br/>Who will expose the killer? This game for one person with a total of 50 murder cases requires criminalistic skills and a good nose, because the 3 different levels of difficulty are a tricky task for amateur detectives. Who accepts the challenge so that the murders in the allotment gardens finally come to an end?<br/><br/>Match, puzzle and find the killer. Choose one of the 50 cases (these are marked in three levels of difficulty) and use the clues on the card to put the pieces in the right order. So you end up with an accurate picture of who the killer is. This game is just right for all hobby detectives, brain joggers, riddles and riddle friends and can also be taken with you on trips thanks to the practical packaging.<br/><br/>",

Soviet armies, defeated by Polish forces during the Battle of Warsaw in August, 1920, tried to establish a defensive line, extending from Polish-Lithuanian border to the Polesie region (Polesia), with the city of Grodno being a pivotal point in the Soviet defences. However, they were outflanked by Polish armies and destroyed, which allowed Polish forces to move further east and eventually reach the Tarnopol-Dubno-Minsk-Drissa line in October, 1920.<br/><br/>The games uses the WB-95 wargaming system by Taktyka i Strategia.<br/><br/>",

To set up, set the game board up diagonally, then take one block of each color and place one at the bottom of each of the six columns in the game board. Finally, add the other blocks in the columns, taking care not to place the same color orthogonally adjacent.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player chooses a color present on the bottom row of the game board, then takes one or more blocks of this color from the bottom of the board. Keep taking turns until all of the blocks have been claimed, then tally your score.<br/><br/>In the basic game, your score is the number of blocks you claimed. In the intermediate game add to this number the product of the number of different colors you claimed and the number of blocks in your most prevalent color. In the expert game, score the product of the number of different colors you claimed and the number of blocks in your first claimed color, then add the number of blocks you collected.<br/><br/>You can also use the RoRop components to play a four-in-a-row game. Starting with the empty game board, on a turn either (a) add a block to the top of any column or (b) remove a block from the bottom of any column, then place it on the top of any column. If a player takes the (b) action, the next player must take an (a) action, if possible. If you create a line of four blocks of the same color, whether orthogonally or diagonally, you win.<br/><br/>",

You can choose to adventure with a game master or in solo/co-op mode.<br/><br/>Become a party of daring heroes with your friends and face off against  bloodthirsty minions. Travel through dangerous forests, descend into dark dungeons, explore the ruins of formerly magnificent fortresses. Come to the aid of helpless villagers and become fabled heroes that the bards will write ballads and epic poems about.<br/><br/>One player can become the sinister Game master: Your role is to lay cunning traps for the heroes and play your arsenal of perfidious Event Cards that will create ever-changing dangers for the heroes through their many different configurations.

Send out warlords with powerful Boss Cards to pick off the heroes one by one.<br/><br/>The lovingly designed components that allow for the visual creation of many different scenes invite you to dive deep into the magical world of 'Ballads &amp; Tales'.

Having been fans of her works for a long time, we were overjoyed when she agreed to visualize all of the characters in her unique style.<br/><br/>Instead of just creating the characters digitally on a PC, Bona painted all characters in Ballads &amp; Tales: Journey of the Brave, as well as its expansions, in oil on canvas in loving detail. This passionate effort is rare these days, and it helped turn each character into a highly crafted work of art. Bona&rsquo;s talent for expressive and aesthetic faces and the nature of radiant oil paints in particular make her paintings and the characters come to life in unique ways and lend an incomparable and nostalgic flair to &quot;Ballads &amp; Tales: Journey of the Brave&quot;.<br/><br/>&quot;Description from the designer&quot;<br/><br/>",

Now, as ancient grudges and rivalries reignite, piracy and privateering are expanding from single-ship engagement into small flotillas commanded by young commodores. Their goal: take the seas back for their home nations, and perhaps win more than a little gold in the process&hellip;<br/><br/>Privateer is the first title in the Articles of War series. It is a fast-paced, hex-based naval engagement where 2 to 6 players use a combination of sailing, cannon-fire, and the occasional boarding action to sink or capture the ships belonging to their opponents. For each enemy ship dispatched, a gold doubloon is awarded to the attacker with ultimate victory going to whichever player has the most gold at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The central mechanic of AoW: Privateer is a special dice economy, where the active player rolls a combination of sail and cannonball dice based on the number of ships they have active and their strategic preferences. After rolling, they spend these dice one-by-one in order to maneuver their ships into position and target their cannons to eliminate enemies. Islands and reefs, placed by the players during setup, provide a limitless variety of map arrangements.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

We want to put all the ornaments on the christmas tree before Kitten arrives, but Tiny Fox, Baby fox&rsquo;s  little brother spills the ornament box and all the balls, stars and sweets roll under the furnitures. The goal is to find the ornaments and decorate the tree before Kitten arrives.<br/><br/>Each player gets 2 furniture cards and randomly put ornaments under the cards. You can only look at your own ornaments. When it is your turn, you ask the player sitting next to you about their ornaments. You have to choose which furniture you ask about, and what type of ornament are you looking for. Eg: Is there any gingerbread under the sofa? If the answer is yes, then you can put on the Christmas tree all the ornaments of that type from under that furniture card. If the answer is no, you move Kitten one space closer to the tree. Then the next player asks a question and so on. If Kitten reaches the tree before you put all the ornaments up, you loose the game. You win if you finish decorating before Kitten arrives. When you win, you get the present card from the slot in front of the tree, which should be placed there before you start. The present cards show different little presents like a little chocolate, a walk among the neighborhood christmas lights, or a spontaneous dance party.<br/><br/>",

It does no good if their troops are falling over dead from heat stroke from wearing cumbersome gear, or freezing to death in the bitter cold with nothing but thin mail to protect them.<br/><br/>The hot, oppressive, Dornish climate means that the Starfall Knights, the heavy cavalry from House Dayne, vassals of House Martell, are less armored than most heavy cavalry from across Westeros, but their lighter armor and barding means they are generally faster and able to strike at enemies more tactically. These skilled horsemen can strike from unexpected quarters, using their spears to great effect in close combat with a devastating charge.<br/><br/>Approximate Height:<br/>  Bannerman: 80mm<br/>  Knight A: 55mm<br/>  Knight B: 54mm<br/>  Knight C: 70mm<br/><br/><br/>        Contents:**<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>4 Miniatures (50mm Bases)<br/><br/>     1 Bannerman<br/>     3 Knights<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Firesiege. A feralis story is a limited-information cooperative game. Each player controls a Valkun Hero with unique abilities and skills, and turn after turn you play action cards to resist the siege of the army of Skreel that are crawling into the city of Medda to kill your leader Norad. The enemy army is nearly infinite, thus to win, your troops must outmaneuver the Skreel by fulfilling different goal cards (E.g., sealing the three Nests of the Skreel, rescuing inhabitants of the citadel of Medda, recruiting enough Marall mercenaries to overcome the enemy, and so on) till they have managed to flip all 6 Banner tokens on the Victory side. Each game will present players with a different challenge depending on the Goal cards selected!<br/><br/>Be aware though, that each action in battle triggers a reaction: i.e., when playing a card, you get to know only one side of it - while all the other players know the other side but not the one you know.<br/>Communication is crucial to success, but of course, in battle, you are not entirely free to speak out loud about your plans...<br/>Both sides of the card you play must be resolved, and one is always good (light side) while the other will affect you negatively (shadow side). If your Hero dies in battle, an enemy sneaks into the city center, or the Incubation track reaches its maximum, the game is immediately lost&hellip; Choose wisely which and when effects should be played, as all actions have consequences and any card could be the last one!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Sitting squarely astride ancient trade routes and with the added impetus of the world's addiction to oil, the area has been a hot spot for centuries.<br/> Now, with the old regime teetering and losing its grip, Iran makes a bid for forcing the West to recognize its complete sovereignty and control over its own affairs by striking at the one thing they care about: the flow of oil. Mining the Straits of Hormuz and declaring it closed to all traffic, Iran defies the world. The US, and perhaps some of its allies, takes action to re-open the straits and get the black gold flowing to the world again.<br/> Next War: Iran is the sixth game in the Next War series. It is unique in the series in that the Allied player has to do the attacking while the non-Allied player attempts to defend its territory against neo-imperial oppression. With a long logistical tail, few true allies in the region, and the menace of Iran's A2AD capabilities, re-opening the Straits is a tall order.<br/> &mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

But this time - this time, they would prepare for war as well. They would not be outmanuevered as they just were. Preparation of war must be on the agenda to save their new home from the unknown and known enemies. <br/>First things first. They had to get to work building up their new land to the glory it once stood for.

The goal of the game is to construct all tier-3 building cards ( or trash them [solo game], removing them from the game). Each turn workers are able to be used as a resource,  depending which workcamp is organized (played sideways). Cards spent as workers can be drawn into the hand to be used as a workcamp or constructed as a building with abilities to help with constructing other buildings. <br/>As cards are discarded they go to the top of the deck if they are used as a worker.

You and your friends live in a neighborhood where nothing is more important than having the nicest garden on the block. Players build three gardens using stacks of clear cards, forming as many words as possible in their completed gardens. Play your cards right, and you'll earn the title of Master Gardener!<br/><br/>Play centers around two decks of double-sided acrylic cards, each containing a pattern of letter-covered plants. Players simultaneously choose one of four cards from their hand to plant in their gardens. The remaining cards are then passed left and a new card is drawn from the deck. This process is repeated for a total of 12 rounds, with each player forming three gardens of 4 cards each by stacking them on top of each other.<br/><br/>Each completed garden contains 16 plants that form a 4 x 4 letter grid. Points are scored from words formed within the grid as well as from personal and shared goals. The player who scores the most total points wins the game.<br/><br/>A Solo Mode is also included with three levels of AI difficulty. Play occurs similarly except that, rather than being passed, unused cards are assembled into gardens for the AI, whose goals are revealed over time.

        "description": "Recreate all the action of the ballpark with this tabletop baseball game that will have you getting base hits and scoring runs just by rolling the dice! With each combination of rolled dice representing a play, grab your teammates and see whose team can rack up the most runs and which team will strike out. It's just the thing to add a fun new twist to America's favorite pastime!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>The game board is a stylized baseball diamond, with a dry-erase scoreboard at centerfield, twelve metal pegs in two different colors, with holes for the pegs at each base location on the diamond. The pegs fit into two &quot;dugouts&quot; of six holes each on opposite sides of the board.<br/><br/>After determining team names and which team is home and visitor, the players write the team names on the scoreboard with the provided marker. The visitor player places one of their pegs at home plate as the batter, and rolls the two dice once. The result is compared to the chart on the playing board, and the runner is either out, or scores a single, double, triple, or home run. If the runner is out, that peg is placed on the lowest numbered open &quot;OUTS&quot; hole on the scoreboard. If the runner advances, the peg is placed in the hole at the proper base location. If a run is scored, the number on the scoreboard is adjusted with the marker and that peg is returned to the dugout.<br/><br/>Play proceeds until the visitor player has three outs, then the home player repeats the process for the bottom half of the inning. The two players may play a full nine innings, or some agreed-upon shorter game. The game can be played by two players or teams.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",
