But before you and your friends can confront a fiendish black, green, or red dragon, you must fight off hordes of evil lizard men, troglodytes, bugbears, and more! Then it's up to you to escape from the dungeon alive!<br/>In addition to the three adventures, there's also a stand-alone board game that uses all the game pieces and poster maps inside. You and your friends will enjoy hours of high excitement with the three adventures and the bonus game, too!<br/><br/>The expansion includes 3 16 page adventure booklets, 3 full color fold up maps, 1d6 and d10, new counters, new floor tiles to enhance the maps, 72 new monster stand-ups, and 8 more character stand-ups. The three adventures can be played separately or as a series of connected adventures.<br/><br/>",

Cosmic Technology, the second expansion, grants civilizations the ability to colonize other planets with fewer resources or become space-faring and no longer vulnerable to player action. Finally, Cosmic Destruction adds a Rogue Black hole that is high victory points, but has to be fed element cubes or the player loses their victory points. It also adds a Red Supergiant, which becomes a black hole when destroyed and the brown dwarf, which try as it might, will never make star status and will die after a set number of rounds.<br/><br/>Together, these expansions give EONS more options in both competitive and cooperative play and has shown to decrease both the PvP and play time of the game, due to players making more strategic decisions that affect themselves instead of others, in an effort to use the new cards that are very valuable to build towards.<br/><br/>EONS: Cosmic Expansions also includes more cooperative scenarios and adds printed secret agendas to the game, so it is almost five expansions in one small box.<br/><br/>",

You have only heard stories, half-truths and lies.<br/><br/>Jonathon Harker and Quincey Morris, renowned members within the Order, tracked Dracula with initially promising, but finally disastrous, results. Their work came to an end in 1886, when Harker left the Order, on the day the Hunt for Dracula was officially closed. It&rsquo;s true that months before, Harker slashed the Vampire&rsquo;s throat while Dracula lay in his coffin. The Order was convinced that Morris&rsquo; firsthand account of the Hunt was accurate and the pair of Hunters did indeed destroy Dracula. Harker maintained that his blow was not fatal and since it was made close to sundown, they could not stay in the Den and make sure. The Order suggested that Harker&rsquo;s grief over the turning of his fianc&eacute;e, Mina Murray, had turned his Hunt into an obsession, one that he could not give up. And since Dracula has not been seen for over a century, perhaps they were right all along.<br/><br/>So what of the infamous novel? Forsaken by the Order, Harker took it upon himself to warn the world of the threat posed by the Night. Working with an unknown writer, Stover Bram, on his biography, Harker believed that a detailed and truthful account of his dealings with Vampires and the Order would both alert the public and force the Order into bolder action.<br/><br/>But the only action they took was to block Harker and Bram at every turn. Finally, 2 years after Harker&rsquo;s death in 1895, Bram managed to get their opus published under a pen name, as a work of gothic fiction, with virtually every detail changed. The facts are that Harker was a skilled Hunter until Dracula broke him, Mina turned but was destroyed by Morris, and Dracula was grievously wounded but escaped with most of his minions. The preposterous Van Helsing was, of course, entirely fictional.<br/><br/>Harker had no descendants, but Bram&rsquo;s bloodline eventually joined the Order, finally acknowledging that they could do more inside the fold than out. Could they be all that remains of Dracula&rsquo;s legacy?<br/><br/>",

I&rsquo;ve held in my hands priceless artifacts, as well as the heads of my dying brothers and sisters. We were given a mission, one that we felt confident we could achieve.

First and foremost, the caravan is a mobile algofuel production unit.  When on a steam column during Thaw, it may produce algofuel barrels with which you can further develop your vehicles by installing Kits on them, or by improving existing Kits.<br/><br/>This expansion also includes new Scenario and Archon cards for the main game.<br/><br/>",

The Mystic Seer knows the exact role of her target. The Mentalist knows if any pair of players are on the same team or not.

Be careful though, because other players can call you out for fun and profit.<br/><br/>Pand&aacute;nte: Light &amp; Dark expansion adds different Light and Dark Panda abilities to the base game for players who want fun and joy or misery and woe! The expansion also adds several extras that can be mixed and matched, including:<br/><br/>Casino Cards:<br/>Each gambit, your group visits a new casino in the Pandalands. Each casino plays the game a little bit differently!<br/><br/>Panda Champions:<br/>Each player takes on the role of a famous Panda. Choose Pandas however you want before the game starts and stick with your Panda throughout the game. Each Panda gives a different special power.<br/><br/>Diamond Dreams:<br/>The blue diamond chips are power ups in this mode. Spend them wisely to get big boosts when you need it.<br/><br/>The Light &amp; Dark abilities, Casinos, Panda Champions, and Diamond Dreams mode options give you 16 possible combinations of game modes. In addition to that, the 17th mode is a seriousface gambling mode. Are you Panda enough to risk real money? <br/><br/>",

Prepare for restless dead, secret societies, and unholy artifacts!<br/><br/>Ancient Relics is based on the theme of the global influence of the Ancient Ones and their cults and moves the action from H.P. Lovecraft's dread-filled New England to the wider world. In Curse of the Jade Emperor players will find exotic, yet hauntingly familiar characters and tales, pulled from the myths and legends of ancient China. The Middle Kingdom's undying past collides with a present made all the more uncertain through the interference of diverse otherworldly actors.<br/><br/>The pull of China is strong and in Call of Cthulhu it attracts academics from Miskatonic University, eager to study the history and artifacts of one of the world's oldest civilizations. The forces of law and order also come to do battle with some of the world's deadliest criminal organizations. Curse of the Jade Emperor also follows Ancient Relics' over-arching theme of artifacts with great and terrible power reoccurring throughout history.

This volume will cover warfare from 1618-1682, when the armies of Europe shifted from heavy pike formations to linear lines of musketeers. Warfare moved towards firepower, although firepower was curbed by the limitations of the matchlock musket. In addition, bayonets were rare and the pike was the infantry's best defense against cavalry. It was also the last time in this era that religion was a major factor in the causes and ferocity of European warfare.

        "description": "Annual 2015 Issue<br/><br/>Shortly after Poland was conquered in 1939, Hitler begin urging an immediate attack in the West. The original plans were uninspiring and his generals feared an attritional stalemate. Over the winter the Germans keep taking the measure of their opponents and hit upon a plan was that inspired, risky, and utterly decisive. Ironic of Hitler to assume his remarkable success was simply the new template for all future campaigns. His eyes turned east....<br/><br/>But why, exactly, did France fall? This ATO Annual edition features four top designers all tasked with re-examining the 1940 campaign and answering that very question. They&rsquo;ve each settled on a single overriding theme to focus on. Yes, here is an issue not just featuring a game or two, but four complete simulations that provide hours and hours of challenging play and comparison. Don&rsquo;t miss it!<br/><br/>Steven Cunliffe with Strange Victory - A solitaire design, this game illustrates how the smaller but nimbler Germans got &quot;inside&quot; the Allied decision cycle to constantly impose small delays and major &quot;rethinks&quot; producing a catastrophic failure on the Allied side - though the better the Germans do may well panic their own High Command into halting them.<br/><br/>Michael Rinella with Springtime for Hitler - Explores the angle that the Germans at this time were quite simply indeed &quot;supermen&quot; at the top of their game. Possessing the best tactical airforce, the best plans and doctrine, and well motivated by National-Socialist ideology, they were unstoppable. Or were they?<br/><br/>John Prados with The Seeds of Disaster - Examines how pre-war plans and on-going intelligence and counter-intelligence efforts, deceit and deception, and foolishly projecting one's own motives on the enemy were THE key factors in explaining what happened in 1940.<br/><br/>Roger Nord with Betrayal! - The most unusual of the four games, the two players are Britain and France respectively, nominally allies, against an automata German player governed by the game system. Did the French do themselves in by folding up early on? Or were they also done in by their British allies choosing to bug out early without informing their &quot;hosts&quot; and refusing any extra help, instead husbanding their resources for defense of Great Britain? Both players may cooperate to win, but absolutely must position themselves to secure their national interests if France does fall.<br/><br/>Four Roads to Paris offers four complete simulations that will provide hours of challenging play and comparison. And as always, the Annual features an &quot;extra-size&quot; magazine, with an in-depth look at the history behind the games, plus other articles. Make yourself the proud owner of this challenging look at the campaign that shocked the West.<br/><br/>Maps - Four full color 17&quot;x22&quot; mapsheets<br/>Counters - Over 300 full color 9/16&quot; die-cut counters<br/>Cards - 24<br/>Rules length - Around 8 pages each game<br/>Charts and tables - Averages 1 page each game<br/>Complexity - Medium<br/>How challenging is it solitaire? - Poor to Excellent, varies by title<br/>Playing time - Up to 3 to 4 hours for each game, 12 to 16 hours to play them all<br/><br/>Designers - Mike Rinella, Roger Nord, Steven Cunliffe and John Prados<br/>Development - Lembit Tohver<br/>Graphic Design - Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

This expansion also has &quot;victim&quot; cards that depict two types of beans. Shuffle the Bohn-edict cards with the regular Bohnanza cards, then deal everyone starting hands. Players then each take one victim card and place it at the back of their hand.<br/><br/>Gameplay changes as follows: Bohn-edict cards serve as a joker and can be played onto either of your bean fields, but they have no beanometer, so if you must harvest a field with a Bohn-edict on top, you earn no gold! If a Bohn-edict is flipped during the trading phase, then the rule on the card comes into effect, changing the trading phase solely for that turn.<br/><br/>If you have the two bean cards in hand &mdash; or in the hand and in trade &mdash; that match your victim card, you can discard the victim card and plant both of those beans in your graveyard. You can plant cards in the graveyard only if they match the top card on your graveyard, and when you harvest, you use the beanometer of the graveyard's top card and convert the most recently played cards into coins.<br/><br/>The AMIGO version of Bohnedikt features more victim cards than in the Lookout Games version.<br/><br/>",

The effect of the Field is only Temporary Paralysis, working on a target as long as it is within Field Generator's line of fire. Temporary Paralysis deprives the target of possibility of any attack. The rest of the abilities of paralysed unit remains unchanged (Modules, Nets, Toughness, Armor etc. works normally). If the Field Generator is nobody's, then it affect all units of all players. If the Field Generator is under control of one player, then it only affects opponents units.<br/><br/>Rotation - When controlled by a player (see Controllable Token above), Filed Generator can be rotated in any direction by the controlling player once per his/her turn, including the turn when a controlling unit is placed adjacent to Filed Generator's connection icon.<br/><br/>",

Your second option is to replace some cards of the Labyrinth deck with Goblin cards giving you a chance to encounter the mischievous blighters throughout the game.

Once during their turn, players may pay the cost shown on a Station to take the corresponding Wagon.<br/><br/>There are two kinds of Railcars: blue-bordered Railcards stay in play until discarded, and take effect immediately; while green-bordered Railcars stay in play but have no effect until the owner decides to discard them during their turn. If a Railcar is taken, the other Railcars on the train slide up to cover the gap, and a new one is added to the end of the train. As soon as the first Railcar behind the Locomotive goes past the last Station, the Locomotive card&rsquo;s special effect triggers for all players. Then a new track of 5 Station tiles, as well as a new train, is built in the center of the table.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "GROWL: Curses + Spells is a double-expansion in one box, and the expansions may be played individually or combined with each other or other expansions.<br/><br/><br/>CURSES allows for a more complex, longer game experience. It is recommended for 5+ players. After players have been dealt their initial card (Gold or Bite), shuffle all 14 Curses cards into the main deck. Deal the additional 3 cards to each player, prepare the Night cards, and proceed as usual.<br/><br/>Icons only negate other icons, not the entire card. For example, if you have a Cursed Charm (adds 1 wound icon and 1 charm icon) and a Hex (negates all your charm icons), the Hex cancels the charm icon but not the wound icon. If you have a Super Salve (adds 2 salve icons) and a Cursed Gold (adds 2 gold icons and a wound icon), then one of the salve icons negates the wound icon, but you still have your gold icons and an extra unused salve icon.<br/><br/>Holy Water symbol: (Holy Water is bad for werewolves, so if you &ldquo;turn&rdquo; while holding this, you might also find yourself dead!)<br/><br/>Infinity symbol: (While in your hand, this negates ALL of a specific type of icon. Infection negates salve icons, Hex negates charm icons.)<br/><br/><br/>SPELLS adds static (ongoing) abilities, plus effects you can trigger by discarding Gold cards. Recommended for 5+ players.<br/> SETUP: After all players have been dealt their starting hands (but before preparing the Night cards), shuffle 3-5 of these expansion cards into the deck. Then prepare the Night cards, and proceed as usual.<br/><br/>Cards with a [SPELL] icon in the upper right are called &ldquo;spells&rdquo; and never go to a hand; instead, they are placed face-up in front of the player they are given to. Their effects are either ongoing (like Wolfsbane or Tanglevine), or else may be triggered as described in the text of the card. When a player with one or more           cards in front of them takes their turn, they must FIRST review and resolve their spells in any order, then proceed to draw and give a card as usual for their turn.<br/><br/>Some spells are triggered at unusual moments, such as after a Night Phase, or at the moment a player dies. If need be, pause the game by calling out &ldquo;Spell!&rdquo; and resolve its effects before proceeding.<br/><br/>The main text on a spell card is not directed at the player who draws it on their turn, but to the player they give the card to.<br/> Icons in the upper left of your spell cards are considered part of your hand, and may negate (or be negated by) icons on cards in hand.<br/> Some other cards (for example, &ldquo;Silver Bullet&rdquo; and &ldquo;S&eacute;ance&rdquo;) are played as spell cards, and there are some card effects that can move or discard them. If a card effect lets you discard a card with a certain icon, you may discard any card of yours with the icon, including a spell card. If a spell is discarded, publicly remove it from play, just as you would discard a resolved Night card. <br/> TIMING: If a card says &ldquo;once per turn&rdquo; then it should be interpreted to mean &ldquo;on your turn only.&rdquo; Spells usually remain active unless the player dies. If the spells (or the players!) move positions, the spells affect new players instead. If multiple players&rsquo; cards conflict, resolve them logically and thematically. In the rare case of complex timing issues, resolve the cards clockwise from the Start Player (1). Finally, if a single player has conflicting cards, they may resolve them in the order they wish. <br/>                                                                                                                                                            &copy;2019 Joey Vigour<br/><br/>",

As long as this card is next to this row, only odd cards can be played into it &mdash; which means you might be forced to play into a different row!<br/><br/>When any row is claimed, the player takes the five cards from that row, starts a new row with their sixth card, then moves the even/odd card to one of the other three rows, specifically the row with the lowest card in its rightmost position.

Age of Steam: Time Traveler Expansion comes with several new maps that represent not only different locations, but also different times as well, and adds an exciting twist as players travel from one map to another using time portals.  Rather than the usual board with one single large map, the game features multiple considerably smaller maps, each representing a different era of time, and together make up the game board.  In addition to building routes within a particular smaller map, players will be able to `travel' from one map in time to another map.<br/><br/>Game-play and theme is similar to that of Railways Through Time, the forthcoming expansion for Railways of the World.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "GROWL: 7 Sins + Undead is a double-expansion in one box, and the expansions may be played individually or combined with each other or other expansions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>7 SINS adds some light punishments and rewards to the game experience. It is recommended for 5-10 players.There are 7 sin cards and 7 virtue cards. After all players have been dealt their starting hands (but before preparing the Night cards), shuffle 5-7 cards into the deck. Then prepare the Night cards, and proceed as usual. Cards with a [SPELLS] icon in the upper right are called &ldquo;spells&rdquo; and never go to a hand; instead, when drawn they are placed face-up in front of another player. Their effects are ongoing for that player &ndash; some good and some bad &ndash; and must be taken into consideration at all times, especially when checking for death or turning into a werewolf.<br/><br/>Icons in the upper left of your [SPELLS] cards are considered part of your hand, and may negate (or be negated by) icons on cards in hand. In addition, some cards affect your neighbors to the left and right of you (skipping over any dead players)! There are virtue cards and sin cards; most of the virtues reward the virtuous players, and most of the sins punish the sinful.<br/><br/>When drawing a sin or virtue on your turn, you must give the card to ANOTHER player (even if you yourself would have qualified to receive it if someone else had drawn the card). If the card has only white text, give it to the player of your choice, to place face-up in front of them.<br/><br/>READING A JUDGMENT: The 7 Sins expansion cards contain two possible colors of text. The YELLOW TEXT is to be read aloud by the player who drew the card on their turn. (Just like in other aspects of the game, players must be honest when queried during a judgment. You may be asked, for example, about the total number of Gold icons you have, or the number of cards in your hand.) After giving the card to another player, they place it in front of them. The WHITE TEXT is the reward (or punishment!) that the player who received the card must accept. Most card effects are ongoing and permanent for the game (unless other cards move them, or move the players themselves). Once a sin or virtue card has been given to a player, they need to only reference the white text, plus any icons. It does NOT move positions, even if a new player would have otherwise qualified for it (for example, the player with Gluttony retains the spell, even if a different player later acquires the most cards).<br/><br/>TIMING: Conflicting cards are resolved clockwise from the left of the Start Player (1). If a single player has conflicting cards, they may resolve them in the order they wish.<br/><br/>UNDEAD adds a third faction which allows dead players to take unique turns instead of being eliminated.<br/><br/>It is recommended for 5+ players. When playing with only 4 or 5 players: <br/>&bull; Remove the 2 Undead cards with the (6+) label in the lower left.<br/>&bull; Final Night cards that automatically would kill players instead only inflict a wound on them.<br/><br/>SETUP: Determine in advance if you are playing with this expansion. Shuffle the Undead cards (they have a zombie on the back) and form a small face-down Undead Deck near the play area.<br/><br/>When a player dies, they are no longer a human or a werewolf. They are now on the undead team, and can never win with the humans or the werewolves. The undead can&rsquo;t change teams or return back to life, even if they give their Wound cards away. Since Undead players are still considered dead, they do NOT take part in Night Phase or draw cards from the main deck. However, during player turns, undead players instead get a special turn. When killed during the game, announce you are undead, place a green &ldquo;I Died&rdquo; card on top of your home tile, and await your undead turn.<br/><br/>UNDEAD TURN: Draw a card from the Undead Deck and read it privately. You have two choices: 1. Resolve any yellow text (and if the card is a spell card give it to a living player to be placed face-up as an ongoing effect for them). 2. If you don&rsquo;t like the card you drew, you may instead discard it and place any card from your hand face-up on top of the main deck for the next (living) player to draw. Then player turns (and undead turns) proceed as usual.<br/><br/>The undead win the game at any time if there are only 2 (or fewer) players left alive. When they win, the undead should make moaning noises or yell &ldquo;...Brains....&rdquo; The player(s) whose death triggered the ending do not win with the rest of the Undead.<br/><br/>If there are 3+ players still alive after you have resolved the Final Night, proceed to The Growl and determine the winning team (werewolves or humans) as usual.<br/><br/>&copy;Joey Vigour<br/><br/>",

The players ́ task is to design pavilions across the square to protect pedestrians in the rain. Helsinki is based on the design of Copenhagen by the same design team, but with some added complexity.<br/><br/>The center board depicts the Senate Square with 8 spaces (two per side) and 8 cards, with each card connected to two spaces. The player on their turn advances their pawn 1-3 spaces, then must choose to take cards or build a pavilion. Each space is connected to two face up cards, and the player may choose to draw these into their hand (making sure to respect the 7 card hand limit, a key challenge in the game). The cards are in one of 5 colors and show a shape of size 2 to 5. To build a pavilion, the player plays a card showing the piece they want to play, and then must play an additional number of cards of the same color to match the size of the piece. Finally, the piece must be &quot;slid&quot; onto their game board (which also represents the Senate Square) from the side of the Square their pawn is on on the main board. Covering certain spaces earns a coat of arms, which may be spent to use one of the 15 one-time special actions.<br/><br/>Players score points for completing rows and columns, and the player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Het Verraad (Treason) is the first expansion to the game De Ontembare Stad (The Indomitable Citadel)<br/><br/>The tactical and strategic alternatives of Treason have grown significantly in comparison to the original &quot;De Ontembare Stad&quot;. Luck is just a small factor in the game. The character of the Dark Master is an important new feature in the game, in fact introducing an extra player in the game. Each player becomes a chance to support the dark side or the good side. Investing in dark power increases the attractiveness of the Dark Master. New playing pieces as Watchtowers allow players to defend themselves against the attacks of the Dark Master. Giving money to the church improves the power of the good forces and gives some protection against the Dark forces. New castle cards and income blocks are a valuable new asset to the game, because the players are able to monitor their income in each category.<br/><br/>As the Citadel is prosperous and the number of citizens grows, rumor has it that a dark character will come inside the Citadel's walls. The Dark Master must be countered by the five Grand Masters to save The Citadel from destruction. But which of the Grand Masters are strong enough to withstand the attraction of the dark side. Since each one of them would like to increase their influence in the Citadel, one or more traitors are more likely to reveal their real character when the game draws to a thrilling finale.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publishers website:<br/><br/>After weeks of battling through impenetrable hedgerows for a few yards of French soil, the US Army has broken out of the beachhead. Operation Cobra has cracked the German front lines.<br/>The veteran 2nd &lsquo;Hell On Wheels&rsquo; Armored Division smashes through German divisions still flattened by the bombing. Beside them the 3rd &lsquo;Spearhead&rsquo; Armored Division races into the disorganized rear of broken German formations. Everywhere American task forces roll down roads, opposition crumbling before them. <br/>However, not all of the Germans are done with fighting. As the Americans begin to encircle German forces cut off in the Roncey Pocket, the hardened 2. &lsquo;Das Reich&rsquo; SS-Panzerdivision strikes south, breaking free of the trap. The two forces clash in the dark, each struggling to accomplish their mission and deny the other side victory. When morning light comes, both sides now know that the fight has only just begun, neither willing to relinquish the field of battle to the other.<br/><br/>INSIDE YOU WILL FIND:<br/>&bull; History of Operation Cobra, the US breakout from Normandy.<br/>&bull; History and complete organisation of the German 12. &lsquo;Hitlerjugend&rsquo; SS-Panzerdivision, one of the most well equipped and combat ready divisions in Normandy, and 2. &lsquo;Das Reich&rsquo; SS-Panzerdivision, full of tough Eastern Front veterans.<br/>&bull; Options to field Panzer, Panzergrenadier, Panzer-pionier, and Panzersp&auml;h companies.<br/>&bull; History and complete organisation of the US 2nd &lsquo;Hell on Wheels&rsquo; Armored Division and 3rd &lsquo;Spearhead&rsquo; Armored Division.<br/>&bull; Options to field Tank, Armored Rifle, and Armored Recon companies.<br/>&bull; Exploits of Oberscharf&uuml;hrer Ernst Barkmann, one of the greatest tank aces in history, and Staff Sergeant Lafayette Pool, America&rsquo;s top tank ace.<br/>&bull; Three new linked scenarios.<br/><br/>- - - -<br/><br/>Flames of War current rulebook range<br/><br/>",

The real purpose behind behind this greater complexity is to more accurately reflect the influences affecting command decisions, by presenting the complexity of tactical detail facing the original commanders.&quot;<br/><br/>The Kit consists of a set of expansion rules and new counters.<br/><br/>Most of the rules of the original basic game continue to apply in the advanced game.  The mapsheet remains the same (and is not included with the expansion kit), although terrain effects are changed.  The unit counters are more numerous, since brigades are the basic level of combat units, rather than divisions as in the basic game.<br/><br/>Changes to the basic rules include:<br/><br/><br/>     Artillery may only attack by means of bombardment and all artillery attacks are resolved separately from other combats.  All Artillery attacks are resolved before other (non-artillery) attacks.<br/>     Zones of Control are &quot;sticky&quot; (not &quot;rigid&quot; as in the basic game).<br/>     Stacking of units is allowed.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This first mini-expansion of Rollecate adds a new challenge to the game: broken rails. The four new cards in the expansion replace cards from the base game, adding more challenge and difficulty. Every time the Rollecate crosses a broken rail, it will derail and force the active player to take an (extra) penalty card. This expansion allows players to build barricades for other players. But they will have to be careful not to become the victim of their own foul play!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It was designed to be an add-on to Pyramid Arcade, but can be played with any Looney Pyramids and some six-sided dice.<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>The goal is to control three cities (circular spaces on board [but not including one's home city]) by arranging a stack of one's pyramids whose pip count is higher than every other players' stack (including dead ones) on that space.<br/><br/>SET UP: Each player gets three trios of pyramids, one color to a player, and pick which corner space to place their starting stack (called a spire, in tree formation) on. Spare pyramids are kept in a bank next to the player. Black pyramids are used to represent dead cities: unused spaces during set up and the remaining spires of players removed from the game. In a four-player game, the central space is a dead city (with its own spire). In two- and three-player games two opposing corners are dead cities.<br/><br/>PLAY: On one's turn roll the three dice and perform the three actions in any order. The options are: Transform: take a piece from one's spire and turn it into a sandship by placing it on its side in a city's port (triangular notch in circle); or, turn or add a sandship into a spire of yours in another city. Build: add a piece (using the smallest pieces first) to your home spire. Unfurl: replace a sandship with the next largest piece. Move: move a sandship to another port, either in the same city, or travel to a port of another city in the same zone. If there is already a sandship there of a smaller size it can be pushed to the next port in that city. Zap: remove a smaller piece from another player's spire using your sandship docked in that city. Wild: choose any of the other actions to perform. If you roll two-of-kind, one is treated as wild. If three-of-kind, two become wild with a bonus wild action. If an action cannot be performed treat the roll as wild.<br/><br/>If a player's home spire is completely zapped away all that player's sandships are removed and any of that person's spires in other cities are replaced with black pyramids.<br/><br/>",

You are still not allowed to reroll any skulls, but even with more than 3 skulls on first roll, you are allowed to reroll. You are not allowed to go to Skull Island and only receive points for each diamond and each gold coin, but twice the amount.<br/><br/>The second card is &quot;Frieden&quot; (&quot;Peace&quot;): You have to end your turn without any sabre. If you succeed, you get double the points, else you get -1000 points for each sabre, you had rolled and no points for your other rolls.

Recent events and new information has convinced the government that it is time to bring it down for study. Safely tucked away at Edwards Air Force Base (more commonly known as Area 51), they try to unlock its secrets - but there are some problems ...<br/><br/>BEFORE YOU PRINT (a note from the designer):<br/><br/>This is a long scenario, 208 cards. I tried a smaller size to save ink and paper, but it didn't work with a couple different scenes.<br/><br/>After several conversations with other players, I would like to emphasize this point: There are several extremely difficult codes and puzzles. The puzzles are not technically needed to win, but solving them will help immensely. You will also miss part of the story if they aren't solved. If you are intent on solving them then plan on spending just as much time on the codes/puzzles as actually playing the game. Also, I have not offered any hints or clues on the forums. This scenario was created to be hard.<br/><br/>You will need a device with a QR reader.<br/><br/>There is no time loop--it's do or die.<br/><br/>There is no combat. Challenges, yes; combat, no.<br/><br/>It is playable with 2, 3, or 4 players (it will even work solo, except for one card that is not totally necessary).<br/><br/>It is hard, but family-friendly in all other ways.<br/><br/>It is long, and there is no good stopping point. Be prepared to use the save option in the box, finish in one long session, or have a table where it can be left out.<br/><br/>Some duplex printers work better than others. You may want to try hand feeding paper for better alignment. A tedious job, but it often helps.<br/><br/>Please be sure your printer is set to 100% not &quot;scale to fit.&quot; If the cards appear too small this is likely the problem.<br/><br/>",

The definitive Peruvian game for lovers of llamas and meteorites.<br/><br/>The second edition includes the Safe Zone expansion!<br/><br/>Llamaged&oacute;n is a light, slightly strategic card game that combines mechanics such as hand management, take that and set collection. On their turn, a player draws a card from the deck. If they draw a Shelter card, then they have to play it immediately by placing it down. Shelters can also be built by combining resources. Beside playing shelters or building them, a player can use one action card which might involve attacking or stealing shelters, swapping one card for another, skipping the next player's turn, protecting their shelter, drawing two cards from the deck or even canceling the action of another player.<br/><br/>Eventually, a player will draw the Llamaged&oacute;n card from the deck (which was randomly shuffled into the lower half of the deck) and this means everyone gets another two turns. After that, whoever has the most shelters is the winner.<br/><br/>With the expansion Llamagedon: Safe Zone, the goal will no longer be the player who ends the game with the most shelters, but rather the player who ends the game with the most Safe Zones under their Control.<br/><br/>The game consists of 55 game cards for the base game, and 6 Safe Zone cards plus 50 tokens in 5 different colors of the expansion. All the content is bi-lingual (Spanish and English).<br/><br/>If you like llamas, meteors and sheep, then Llamaged&oacute;n might be a good fit for you.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

These cards are dealt/picked up alongwith tickets in the same quantity and with the same 'keep/dispose' rules.There are also up to 9 bonuses for the end-of-game scoring.<br/><br/>The board does not have any grey tracks or parallel tracks (though there some 'lucky' cards in with the Tourist cards which offer this facility) - but you can travel by air, BNG express or Rotterdam light railway for extra advantage.<br/><br/>There are many new options in the rules: run 2 routes into 1, exchange all your cards at the start but keep all the new ones: discard 5 cards and pick up 5 new ones, as your turn: and many more. You can also call time when your wagon stock reaches 3, if you want, giving you the advantage of stopping other players completing tickets.<br/><br/>",

For example, Rogue's Retreat lets hired units escape to the discard pile, while the Peasants at Revolt Volcano begin their uprising before you even start to play.<br/><br/>Each deck of Villages: Distant Lands includes 48 standard cards, 12 location cards, and a sheet of rules.<br/><br/>",

Drehe den so genutzen M&auml;zen um 90&deg;, falls er nicht ohnehin schon gedreht war. Dann gib Leopold diesem Spieler.<br/> Ausnahmen: Man muss Leopold II. behalten, man kann ihn nicht abwerfen.

Though conceived as passenger craft, during the First World War rigid and semi-rigid airships performed long-range scouting and bombing missions.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: Zeppelins includes die-cut-and-mounted playing pieces, but these are special, oversized ones: 2/3-inch by 1-and-1/3-inch large pieces depicting famous airships of Germany, Great Britain, the United States, Italy, Austria-Hungary and France. These are used with the new tactical and operational rules provided; unlike the standard game rules that treat all airships the same, with the Zeppelins module, each airship class has its own range and endurance qualities.<br/><br/>Every airship that played an important role in the First World War is present, both German Navy and German Army machines that scouted for the High Seas Fleet and attacked naval targets. The ultra-long-range &quot;Africa Ship&quot; L59 is present, along with the big, modern L100 class canceled by the war's end.<br/><br/>The Royal Navy maintained a large fleet of airships, and the British get the Italian-built semi-rigid airship SR-1 along with the many rigid airships built at war's end. Italy built a large number of semi-rigid airships (with a solid keel rather than a complete frame as with a true zeppelin) and these are also included.<br/><br/>The United States Navy gets its Shenandoah and Los Angeles, and the United States Army the big semi-rigid airship Roma. The French Dixmude, a former German zeppelin, is here as are Austria-Hungary's small contingent.<br/><br/>New airship-centered scenarios, or modifications of current scenarios, are included for many of the Great War at Sea series games: Mediterranean, Jutland, U.S. Navy Plan Gold, U.S. Navy Plan Red and Dreadnoughts.<br/><br/>",

Civilizations develop their military and wage wars with each other.

        "description": "In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.<br/><br/>At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.<br/><br/>Players take turns as follows:<br/><br/>     Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.<br/><br/><br/>The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.<br/><br/>This edition of Chez Geek from Pegasus Spiele includes both the Chez Geek base game and Chez Geek 2: Blockparty &ndash; the Chez Geek sequel from Pegasus that included both of the expansions from Steve Jackson Games: Chez Geek 2: Slack Attack and Chez Geek 3: Block Party.<br/><br/>",

INCOMING FIREBALL!!!<br/><br/>Will your castle walls melt from the Hydra's fiery breath or will you tame the mythical beast and launch fireballs at your opponent's castle?!<br/><br/>Catapult Feud Hydra exapansion adds a fireball launching Hydra to the game.<br/><br/>This expansion requires Catapult Feud to play.<br/><br/>During setup, place the Hydra in the middle of the battlefield, at an equal distance between players. If you are also using the Volcano Expansion, then place the Hydra to the side of it. Shuffle the Hydra Cards and place them in a pile, face down, next to the Hydra.<br/><br/>Taming the Hydra: During your turn, as a free action you may decide to try and Tame the Hydra! To do so, shuffle the Hydra cards, reveal the top one and resolve it as per its rules.<br/><br/>BEWARE: Taming the Hydra is a risky task. You might end up getting a chance to deal extra damage to your opponent, but there is always the chance that the Hydra will retaliate and scare away your troops! It is possible to lose the game if the Hydra scares away your last troop! Every time you try to Tame the Hydra, one of its heads will respond to you. Depending on the head, there is a different outcome.<br/><br/>Right Head: The Hydra is extremely angry and retaliates! It scares your troops away and some of them desert you! Remove one of your troops from the game. If this was the last troop, you lose the game!<br/><br/>Left Head: You barely managed to control the Hydra to do your bidding. You may use it to launch one Ball of Fire to your opponent.<br/><br/>Center Head: You did an exceptional job taming this beast! You may use it to throw 2 Balls of Fire to your opponent!<br/><br/>Warning! This is a game of construction/destruction of plastic bricks and figures... NOT your opponent, pets, or people who may foolishly pass through the field of battle! Please play fair and be careful not to hurt each other or damage anything... other than your opponent's attempt at an impenetrable fortress!<br/><br/>Includes:<br/>- 1 Hydra<br/>- 4 x Fireballs<br/>- 6 x Hydra Cards<br/>- 1 Instruction Sheet<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

One tile is placed for each player in the game (i.e. in a 3-player game, the three furthest-back trip cards will each have one Butterfly Effect tile placed face-down above them).  When that trip card is visited, the player picks up the tile and places it face up above any trip card later in the timeline. No trip card may have more than one tile placed above it. A face-up tile affects both trips on a trip card, and rewards or subtracts points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>These tiles were included for free for all backers of Loop Inc. on Kickstarter.

Zombies still infest the wastelands without abandon and every death leads to an undeath. It's been survival of the meanest, baddest, and cleverest ever since. Standing apart from the fray is the Z-team, a special-ops group. They've been selected for their diverse zombie-slaying abilities and equipped to eradicate the infected zones so humanity can start the process of rebuilding civilization.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Z-team Alpha includes four post-apocalyptic Z-team members. These miniatures are designed to work with the Zpocalypse Squad base stands, however there is nothing stopping you from using them for your own mischievous ends in any other tabletop games.

        "description": "Designer Uwe Rosenberg has a talent for dreaming up new and inventive card games, and Mamma Mia! is a perfect example of this talent, with players placing pizza ingredients into a combined pool, then trying to time their pizza baking in order to make use of what's available in the kitchen.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with eight different pizza orders to fill, with one of those order cards in hand; each player also starts with a hand of ingredient cards (showing pepperoni, mushroom, pineapple, green pepper or olive). On a turn, a player lays down one or more ingredient cards of a single type into a common stack, then optionally adds a pizza order card to that stack. He then refills his hand by drawing as many cards as he played from either the shared ingredient deck or his own order deck.<br/><br/>After the draw pile is exhausted, the shared pile of cards is flipped over and sorted by ingredients until an order comes up. If enough ingredient cards are available to fill that order, the owner scores it; if not, the player can make up the difference by playing cards from his hand (and thereby scoring the order) or else return the card to the bottom of his order deck.<br/><br/>Once all the orders are scored or returned, shuffle the ingredients used in pizzas and start another round of play. After three complete rounds, the player who's filled the most orders wins!<br/><br/>It includes a promotional expansion consisting of 10 double ingredient cards, two in each of the five ingredients.<br/><br/>During game set-up, the double ingredient cards are substituted into the deck in place of two ingredients of each type. For game play, a double ingredient is handled exactly the same as the single ingredients, but of course count as two ingredients of that kind.<br/><br/>If an ingredient is needed to complete an order, double ingredients on display must be used first. If necessary, a player must overpay, which also applies to double ingredients played from the hand to complete an order.<br/><br/>",

It only contains 12 event cards out of 72 mixed cards without a common theme. Since this is not enough for a real game, it only comes with a brief summary of the gameplay. Those six different bags of cards can be recognized by the number of each of the first card in a bag: U001, U013, U025, U037, U049, U061.<br/><br/>Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly. Anno Domini is a blast to play, it is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

He can:<br/><br/><br/>    Discard a card onto the Desk of Elements; he scores one point if that element is not currently present on the Desk.<br/>    Take elements on the Desk to complete a formula on a card in his hand. He scores points equal to the number shown on the formula, then places the element cards face-down over the bottom half of the card so that all players can see the formula. His turn then ends.<br/>    Use one or more previously completed formulas, along with any elements required and available on the Desk, to complete a more difficult formula. He can use formulas in front of himself or other players to do this. Any elements under formulas reused this way are returned to the Desk. Any opponent who loses one or more formulas this way scores half the points of the more difficult formula just completed. The player's turn then ends.<br/>    Plays a spell from his hand to take a card from the desk into his hand, to decompose one completed formula or to transform one formula into another. After playing a spell, he must take another action, which could be playing another spell.<br/><br/><br/>After the deck runs out, players continue to take turns until no one has cards remaining in hand.

They play just like any other Building Tile but their size lets them fill in isolated zones or fit neatly onto the edge of a growing skyscraper. OZBs also present new scoring methods based on the current configuration of the city so their potential effect on your score and the city itself, is different each time they're played.<br/>    The Fortune Die is a six-sided die with the red, green, blue and yellow on four sides and purple on two sides. Certain Role Cards and new Building Tiles use the Fortune Die to create a casino-feel with probability-base rewards.<br/><br/><br/>",

The other depot may be placed in the third (green) or seventh (red) space.<br/>4- At the begginning of the game each player receives 3 cards instead of 1. They must pick 2 of these cards to place face down next to each of their depots.<br/>Note: If this expansion is combined with the &quot;Expansion 1 - Patrons&quot; (included with the game), the Food Depots must always be executed first.<br/>5- When a player ends his turn in a space with a Depot, he takes the corresponding card.<br/>Note: If the new card forces the player to exceed the hand limit, the player must exchange a card of his hand face down with the card of the Depot.<br/><br/>This expansion is called &quot;Expansion 4,&quot; as the first three expansions are already in the base game.<br/><br/>",

The various pieces are different and can represent a multitude of things so that the game is different every time you play. In addition to the board and the ships that move on it, there are cards.

You search for planets to colonize and possibly conquer. Use your fleets to engage in battles and use characters to assist you in reaching your faction's goals.

It brings gods from Cthulhu Mythos (Great Old Ones, Outer Gods and the Nightmares) as well as Aztec and Egyptian deities to the world of the war of mythological gods, without changing the main concept of a deck-building game with a drafting and bidding mechanism. It consists of several mini-expansions (available only in this bundle, not separately):<br/><br/>Heroes - one extra Hero card for each pantheon<br/>Priests and Prophets - one extra Special Prophet or two extra Special Priests with unique abilities for each pantheon (wooden discs with stickers and reference cards)<br/>Reward deck - new bonuses for the winner of a round (instead of a regular one)<br/>Miracle tokens - acrylic crystals to replace the regular cardboard tokens<br/><br/>New Pantheons available:<br/><br/>Aztec (Quetzalcoatl, Nanahuatl, Coatlicue)<br/>Egyptian (Anubis, Bast, Maat)<br/>Great Old Ones (Cthulhu, Hastur, Ithaqua)<br/>Outer Gods (Nyarlathotep, Shub-Niggurath, Yog-Sothoth)<br/>Nightmares (Chaugnar Faugn, Ghatanothoa, Tsathouggua)<br/><br/>The Polish edition also includes a re-printed rulebook for the base-game and 4 Last Stand cards, originally available in the German and English editions of the base game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The 3-player expansion for Krakow 1325 AD adds an exciting new dimension to the basic game. When there are only three players, the team work typical of the standard game is reduced to a pleasant memory. Each player has his own set of Influence Tokens and faces both his opponents in the Intrigue Card game and the struggle for board domination. The rules changes involved are simple, but the tactical options and scope for treachery have multiplied. Of course, final victory still depends on the scores of the Secret Identities, which are not revealed until Game End.<br/><br/>&quot;Now you're on your own...&quot; is the motto of this expansion, again developed by Peter Struijf and Melchior van Rijn and self-published by Geode Games.<br/><br/>The 3-player expansion to Krakow 1325 AD will make its debut in October 2009 at Spiel in Essen (Germany). There are two versions: a ziplocked English/Dutch version and a boxed German version (which also contains a complete set of Intrigues and rules in that language).<br/><br/>Peter wisely decided not to rely on his own high-school education to create the German version. He was overwhelmed when he found Andreas Brandhorst, sci-fi author and translator of almost the entire Discworld (Scheibenwelt) series, willing to translate the texts of the Intrigue cards. The game rules were translated by fellow Boardgamegeek Christian Krach.<br/><br/>Ownership of the basic game is, probably obviously, required to play the expansion set.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Space Maze Rollercoaster is a mini expansion that contains 3 'Rollercoaster' cards which can be added to the deck of action cards in the base game. You should choose whether or not you want to use it before every game, because it changes gameplay considerably. If you do use it, make sure that in your board setup the relic tile is not on the edge of the board.<br/><br/>Effect: Take a tile at the end of any column the alien activating the card is in (up/down or left/right) and place it at the other end.  Now shove all tiles in that column one place further.  Aliens on tiles always move with them, even if they're moved to the other end of the board.<br/><br/>Adding the card to the base game changes the way you play in a way that it becomes more funny and chaotic and maybe a little less tactical. Therefore it's advised not to just add the card to your base game as if it's just one more action card.<br/><br/>'Space Maze Rollercoaster' was a free expansion when you bought the game at Essen 2011.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Darkness surrounds the shores of the world and seeps from caves deep beneath the Earth. The maddening howl of eldritch beasts echoes on the night air. Dangerous artifacts from strange eons call to you at all hours of the day. Your quest is nearly complete. So what if bands of enterprising &ldquo;heroes&rdquo; have started snooping around. The Old Ones have heard your prayers. Now all you need to do is finish your plans and set them free before these Investigators find you!<br/><br/>Rise of Cthulhu: Dark Secrets is the first expansion to last year&rsquo;s successful Rise of Cthulhu card game. ROC: DS adds all new Monsters, Artifacts, and Old Ones for players to use in their shadowy path to victory. In addition, the expansion introduces a brand new mechanic: the Investigator. These &ldquo;would-be heroes&rdquo; set out to hunt down rumors of your corrupting influence and seek to stop you from awakening the Old Ones. When they appear, they force both you and your opponent to deal with the threat they bring, lest they halt the coming of the age of madness you seek to unleash.<br/><br/>When an Investigator card is drawn, it is placed on the corresponding Location printed in the upper right hand corner of the card. When an Investigator lands on a Location without an Old One, it banishes all the Cultists assembled there, effectively returning all Cultist cards in play to their owner&rsquo;s hands. Any Monsters or Artifacts that are in play on that Location are removed from the game. The Location then resets to neutral (turns sideways so that it&rsquo;s not facing either player).<br/><br/>Each Investigator has a number in a red circle in the upper left hand corner of their frame. This represents their resources they bring to bear against both cultist players. Players must play Cultist cards to equal or exceed the resource value listed to remove the Investigator from the Location. Until the Investigator is removed from the Location, players may not play any Cultist cards on any other Location except that one; furthermore, cards played on a Location with an Investigator present on it do not cause the Location to shift to face the player with the highest total value of cards. Once the resource rating is met or exceeded, the Investigator is defeated and removed, at which time the Location would face the player with the highest total Cultists in play there.<br/><br/>Lastly, this expansion adds a new player aide to the card, something the community asked for following the release of the core game.<br/><br/>",

You have one goal and one goal only: Annihilate your foe's believers and thereby move yourself one step closer to absolute power.<br/><br/>Drafting prayer cards and power cards allows you to slowly build your might. Using those cards, you send your followers into battles, build temples, and inflict terrible curses on the unfaithful. You face a tough decision in every single hand: Should you put your own power on the line to help your believers win their battles, or should you turn your back on them, sending them to a certain death? If no god yields, hurricanes will face off with deathly plagues, tempests will extinguish walls of fire, and the ranks of the faithful will grow smaller every second. Once you get rid of your opponent's last prophet, it's time to rest and listen to the cheerful song of your people. You have won the clash of gods.<br/><br/>Teomachia: Mitologia słowiańska (Theomachy: Slavonic Mythology) is the first expansion. It introduces the Slavonic pantheon to the game previously consisting of four mythologies: Celtic, Greek, Norse and Sumerian. The expansion provides three new gods of Slavonic pantheon (Mokosh, Perun and Veles), as well as four additional gods to previously existing pantheons (one to each). Also in package are new Slavonic myth cards, myth cards from basic edition reprinted using improved graphics, a player aid card and a small expansion Priests, consisting of ten wooden discs representing priests with special abilities (for all 5 pantheons).<br/><br/>",

Thirty-four new scenarios show the desperate fighting in this sector.

Finally, a set of six scenarios covers Operation Little Saturn, the Soviet attack against the Italian Eighth Army launched at the same time as Operation Mars.

All of these cards have a special ability: you can pass a card to another player or you can use this card in your own movie.<br/><br/>Why would you want to pass the cards? Because they affect usual movie production rules and impose some limitations! Here is an example. Producer&rsquo;s Son is not very skilled and he will decrease your box office with his terrible acting. However, he is still an Actor. The decision to keep him or to pass him is yours!<br/><br/>Art House Actress, on the other hand, is quite experienced but you can&rsquo;t add any green crew cards to her movie. Why? Well, art house movies usually don&rsquo;t need any special effects or anything that high budget team can offer.<br/><br/>If you got an &ldquo;Other Side&rdquo; card from another player you have to use it in your movie. You can&rsquo;t get rid of it by discarding it! All of the &ldquo;Other Side&rdquo; cards have a ten-pointed star in the background to be easily recognizable.<br/><br/>The Other Side of Hollywood shows you the darker side of Hollywood but does it in a light-hearted manner. It is worth mentioning that all of the add-on&rsquo;s cards are optional to use. You can add all of the new cards in to the deck or try any combinations.<br/><br/>More interaction to the game. More strategies to try. More interesting decisions to make!<br/><br/>",

In order to steal them, the gang must face tireless Inspector Zenigata again, who has made their capture his reason for existence.<br/><br/>This expansion integrates with the base game and increases the possibilities and the strategies with new equipment, vehicles and rules that can also be used in the base game. The characters' characteristics are strengthened and renewed with new cards, including five special cards which make Lupin more elusive, Jigen more infallible, Goemon more inflexible, Zenigata more stubborn, and Fujiko more unreliable and undressed than ever.<br/><br/>A milestone of the new imperfect cooperative game style, Lupin the 3rd shows in these new missions a variable and unpredictable structure for a profound and unique game experience!<br/><br/>",

It commemorates the first annual Catan Con in Nashville TN.<br/><br/>You use this expansion with the Catan base game, the expansions Catan Seafarers, and Catan Cities &amp; Knights. You can also play with the 5-6 player expansions for all the games and expansions mentioned.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>2 Nashville Hexes<br/>1 Lonely Cowboy game piece in 2 parts<br/>Rule Sheet<br/><br/>Setting up the Game<br/><br/>Remove the Desert Hex from the game and replace it with the Broadway Hex. Build your board by randomly distributing terrain hexes, while ensuring that the broadway hex is in the center of the island.<br/><br/>Place the number tokens according to the game rules. Replace the terrain hex that receives the &quot;2&quot; token with the Gaylord Opryland hex and remove the &quot;2&quot; token as well.<br/><br/>Since neither Nashville hex has a number token, they do not produce resources when the dice are rolled.<br/><br/>The Lonely Cowboy<br/><br/>When the lonely cowboy visits you, he will sing for his supper and you will gladly pay him.<br/><br/>He consists of 2 parts.  Slide both parts together so the musical notes are facing each other. The lonely cowboy replaces the robber.  Place him on the Broadway hex during setup.<br/><br/>Advantage of the Nashville Hexes<br/><br/>Whenever you roll a &quot;7&quot;, the usual actions are carried out normally. (Discards (if any), move the cowboy, &quot;sing&quot; for a card etc.).  Then before you take the rest of your turn, activate the lonely cowboy.<br/><br/>The lonely cowboy gives one resource from the bank to each player with one or more settlements on a Nashville hex intersection (even if you have 2+ settlements/cities, you only get one card).  You receive the card type matching the terrain hex the Lonely cowboy currently occupies.<br/><br/>Important:  Once the lonely cowboy leaves the broadway hex, it can never be placed on either Nashville hex for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>",

Over the next 16 hours, our writers will battle this powerful card-writing algorithm to see who can write the most popular new pack of cards. If the writers win, they&rsquo;ll get a $5,000 holiday bonus. If the A.I. wins, we&rsquo;ll fire the writers.<br/><br/>The Human Pack consists of 30 beautiful cards about the human condition straight from the hearts of our human writers.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The writers sold 2% more packs, so their jobs will be replaced by automation later instead of right now. Happy Holidays.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (from Black Friday, 29th November 2019)<br/><br/>",

It was a promotion piece provided at Spiel 2008 and then added to the Neroshima Hex Babel13 expansion (only preorder).<br/><br/>&quot;THUNDER&quot; is a special terrain element. &quot;THUNDER&quot; covers two hexes. Place a Turret tile on one of the 2 hexes. &quot;THUNDER&quot; is armed with this Turret.<br/><br/>If a player occupies the second hex (the steering wheel) with a friendly unit, he can rotate the Turret during his turn. During a Battle the Turret does damage to every unit hit by it (no matter if its your or enemy unit).<br/><br/>The Unit which steers &quot;THUNDER&quot; does not perform any other action during the battle. If the steering unit dies or leaves the hex, &quot;THUNDER&quot; is unoccupied. The next player who moves a Unit there will gain control of &quot;THUNDER&quot;. If during a battle nobody controls &quot;THUNDER&quot;, the Turret attacks automatically in the direction it is aimed.<br/><br/>&quot;THUNDER&quot; can not be destroyed; you can only kill the unit that controls it.

Montgomery said the operation was a 'springboard for a powerful full-blooded thrust to the heart of Germany.' But the plan had one fatal flaw: Allied intelligence had reported few German units in the vicinity of Arnhem--but it turned out that two SS Panzer divisions and Field-Marshal Walther Model, known as the 'Fuhrer's Firemen' were awaiting the British at ground zero. The one British battalion which was able to fight its way to the bridge was cut off, becoming 'a collection of individuals holding on' awaiting relief that would never arrive.<br/><br/>Arnhem: The Third Bridge includes a well-researched historical game map of the battlefield, eight new scenarios and a Platoon Leader 2.x campaign game. You will also receive extensive new rules providing the flavor of the battlefield and its combatants, including high walls, a new form of breach, and SS engineers. As a special bonus, ATB includes a sheet of color, die-cut game pieces providing Red Devil squads and SMC counters for historical leaders including Colonel Frost and armor leader Captain Grabner. Everything is included to play using your existing rulebook and game pieces. (Ownership of Beyond Valor and West of Alemein are necessary to play this game).&quot;<br/>Note the countersheet was a limited time offer with the first edition and was not included in the later 2nd edition of this game.<br/>Module requires Beyond Valor and West of Alemein or For King and Country.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Advanced Squad Leader<br/><br/><br/>",

Malleus Mallificarum has been published and, although condemned by the church, is widely used in the persecution of witches.<br/><br/>Coven: The Village includes a new rotating Inner Wheel to replace the one from the base game. It also adds 36 Village Cards the replace the original Balance Cards, and a Village card is read when the new Inner Wheel triggers the Full Moon.  Suspicion Tokens track how suspicious the villagers are of each player, and are gained whenever you increase Balance. Suspicion may also gain Personal Edict Cards, which are penalties that last for the remainder of the game, and may even prevent you from winning unless certain conditions are met. Coven: The Village also includes 36 Village Cards, 15 Personal Edict Cards, 30 Suspicion Tokens, 5 new Reference Cards, Rules, a six sided die, and an additional spindle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Nefarious Neighbor expansion opens the Runes &amp; Regulations game up to 5-8 players, and it completely changes the dynamics. In this expansion, a dark sorcerer with horrifying powers (and intentions) moves into the neighborhood, forcing other players to decide whether to team up or continue to quibble. The Nefarious Neighbor steals Creatures from other players and performs dark rituals to mutate them into frightening beasts. That neighbor plays with their own standalone deck (included in the expansion pack) which includes Corrupted Creatures, Curses, and Dark Runes.<br/><br/>The Nefarious Neighbor&rsquo;s powers are so immense that their Corrupted Creatures cannot be destroyed, hexed, or stolen; however, the expansion also includes cards to shuffle into the Main Deck to help other players fight back and thwart that neighbor&rsquo;s villainous plans.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting parts of the Nefarious Neighbor expansion is the introduction of player role cards. In addition to the Nefarious Neighbor, other players will have the opportunity to take on a new role (in secret). These roles provide you with a second win condition that nobody else knows about, giving you the opportunity to surprise your neighbors with an unexpected victory. Since only the Nefarious Neighbor&rsquo;s role is known, each other player around the table is left to wonder what role their opponents might secretly be playing. These roles include things like Mr. Griffin (who wins if they successfully summons 3 Griffins), the Henchman (who wins if the Nefarious Neighbor wins and Henchman has no creatures on their Lawn), and the Humane Sorcerer (who wins by successfully saving a Stray Dog or Alley Cat).<br/><br/>Runes &amp; Regulations by itself is a super fun and interactive game, and we designed it to stand entirely alone. I say this because the game really works without the expansion, and we didn&rsquo;t even start working on the expansion until we had the original game completely finished and play tested. Getting to add on this expansion was a dream, though, and getting the opportunity to actually make it a reality because of the support so far on this project is incredibly exciting. The introduction of this expansion just makes the game so much more dynamic (and really creates two different games).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The government will select the members of the city council for the first few years until the city rises and flourishes, by which time the most popular member will receive the position of Mayor.<br/><br/>In order to build the city, you and the other councilmen must maintain a low level of pollution, fight crime, create jobs, and sustain an adequate city budget. If you and the others don't keep up the good work, the city project might not succeed, the government will take over, and all players will lose.<br/><br/>As a member of the council, you must also strive to gain the favor of the different political groups who rule the streets of your city. As the game progresses and the city grows larger, more and more political interest groups will try to impose their will on the city by knocking on your office door and asking you for small &quot;favors&quot; in which you will have to act on their behalf. In return, they'll offer you their support and you'll receive victory points for your personal cause, possibly allowing you to become the city's first Mayor.<br/><br/>City Council: Deluxe Edition contains the original game along with one expansion:<br/><br/>&bull; City Council: The Disaster Deck consists of ten event cards that disrupt &quot;normal&quot; city life by causing havoc everywhere, and it introduces a new game mode, creating a fully co-operative experience for City Council players. In each round of play, the players change roles, taking crucial steps to prevent these events from tearing apart the growing city.<br/><br/>City Council: Deluxe Edition was originally, erroneously, reported to contain the City Council: Government Agent expansion.<br/><br/>",

Everyone tries to find new ways to improve their lives, new means to grow their lands and new constructions that create an easier life. In Hoyuk: Anatolia, you must prove your quality through three different Achievements: build a Water Supply System for your village so the water can reach your land, throw the best Fest in the valley, and finally, build two Artifacts!<br/><br/>Each player chooses to complete two different Achievements at the beginning of the game. Each player who has managed to keep their Achievements intact until the end of the game will score additional Victory Points but most importantly each Achievement will score a different amount of points. The players use Drop counters in order to build the Water Supply System. Five Drop counters must be placed on five Houses of the same color and of the same Block. Furthermore these Houses must be connected to each other and at least one of them must be placed on the river or the lake of the game board. To place a Drop counter on a House, players must wait until the Construction phase and then choose not to build one of three Elements of their Construction board.<br/><br/>The Artifacts can be built easily but can be destroyed as easy as well because they are affected by all Catastrophes. Players can build an Artifact on the top of their Houses at the same way as the Drop Counters but in this case this House must be two stories high. If players do not complete this Achievement by the end of the game, they can still score Victory points. This is the only Achievement that has an advantage but it also gives less Victory Points.<br/><br/>This is an era where tribes search for a way to upgrade their social status, so they throw several Fests where they meet each other and celebrate. This is the last Achievement where players create the best Fest in the Valley by offering five different materials. These materials can be found on the Fest tokens but also on the Aspect cards. The Aspect cards have different images that must be matched with the Fest tokens. Once players have five Aspect cards that match with five Fest tokens, they discard them to score Victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

This game is played with only 1 copy of the game, so players do NOT need to bring their own decks to the table.<br/><br/>The object: Collect as many &quot;Carrots&quot; as possible, hoping that one of them is the randomly predetermined &quot;Magic Carrot&quot;. In doing so, you must keep your bunnies alive as long as possible, while eliminating your opponents' Bunnies because once all the Carrots have been claimed you must have a living Bunny to win.<br/><br/>The problem: Your opponents are armed with outrageous weapons (from level 1 weapons such as a &quot;Kitchen Whisk&quot; to level 12 weapons such as the &quot;Nuclear Warhead&quot;) and you must roll higher than these levels to survive.<br/><br/>Use cards to defend your Bunnies, such as the hilarious &quot;Magic Spatula&quot; or other special cards, or use a &quot;Feed The Bunny&quot; card to force your opponent to buy cabbage and water (if they have the money to do so...)<br/><br/>Your opponents, as the back of the box quotes, &quot;will stop at nothing to keep you from winning the game, which can get dreadfully vengeful, horribly nasty, hilariously messy, and just plain fun!&quot;<br/><br/>Includes:  770 large cards, 94 small cards, 11 dice, 9 pawns, 27 chips, 30 vouchers, 4 red card stands, 2 clear card stands, a Yellow Ball with a Red Stripe, Bunny Blanks with Stickers, Promo Cards, 4 Play Mats, and a Rulebook<br/><br/>",

But it also includes a black AI controlled train, black AI laser towers and turrets, black AI control center, exclusive civilian counters, blue armor reinforcements and more!

Once they are gone, they are gone.<br/><br/>As of January 2015, Steve Jackson Games has resumed control of this product. Counter sheets are available directly from them, and they have stated they are working on a PDF of the rules / scenarios booklet.<br/><br/>NOTE: Do NOT attempt to order from Fire Mountain Games.

Monks search their souls for illumination, priests seek to teach the grace of God, and grand towers and cathedrals are erected in his name.<br/><br/>But not all choose to follow in God's light - a host of heretics, pagans, and cultists threatens to destroy the sanctity of the church, risking damnation for their dark and sacrilegious ways. But who is truly without sin? The coffers of the church swell from tithe and indulgence, crusaders war and plunder in the name of God, while the inquisition silences their enemies in a wake of terror and blood.<br/><br/>The choice is yours: join ranks with forces of God to spread his holy word, or risk your eternal soul for unimagined power in this fan-made expansion to Dominion!&quot;<br/><br/>",

It only contains about 8-15 event cards without a common theme. Since this is not enough for a real game, it only comes with a brief summary of the gameplay.<br/><br/>Each player receives nine of these cards (or less, if you want the game to be shorter), and may only look at the descriptions. Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly. Anno Domini is a blast to play, it is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>Contained as a free bonus in this German version of Such a Thing?, this German version of Zooloretto and this German version of Airlines Europe.<br/><br/>",

The cards are numbered, so you can stack the deck and play out four scripted turns that show the basic mechanics. And it only takes a couple of minutes. Instructions, dialogue, and stupid jokes are included. Or use your own stupid jokes - we won't mind.<br/><br/>The other 39 cards are promos, to give away to friends, customers, or total strangers. These are completely new cards, each guaranteed to be more munchkinly, more insane, more cursed than the last. And we've included multiple copies. Every munchkin will want at least one of each. Will you be generous? Or will you demand tribute? Of course, you are a munchkin, so you will keep at least one of each for yourself, right?<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tOtherPart of the Munchkin series<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCautionIf you have no experience with playing Munchkin-games this will NOT help you learn the game!

These cards are not shuffled into the deck; instead, at the start of the game, the owner of the &quot;Promo&quot; cards may choose one of them to place on the table and play when desired.

        "description": "The Loot Box is a collection of promotional content and small modules for several games published by Board&amp;Dice. Everything has been carefully crafted and designed with you&mdash;the players&mdash;in mind.<br/><br/>Teotihuacan: City of Gods<br/>&bull; 1 Book of Challenges<br/><br/>The Book of Challenges contains 6 variants for experienced players, all featuring a specific predetermined setup which puts the focus on a certain aspect of game play. Some of these variants also include special rules and victory conditions which add to the difficulty level and change the mindset of player on how to achieve victory.<br/><br/>Tekhenu: Obelisk of the Sun<br/>&bull; 1 Book of Challenges<br/>&bull; 1 cloth bag<br/>&bull; Module: Noble Buildings (including 4 Noble Building tiles)<br/><br/>The Book of Challenges contains 3 variants for experienced players, each adding a twist to the normal setup procedure and some additional flavor to the game play.<br/><br/>The Noble Buildings module gives each player a special Building tile. Once per game, when constructing a Building, whether as a workshop or quarry (Osiris God Action), around the Temple Complex (Hathor God Action), or in a foreign region (Seth God Action), you may place this tile underneath the newly constructed Building. If you do so, double the rewards received.<br/><br/>Tawantinsuyu: The Inca Empire<br/>&bull; 1 Book of Challenges<br/>&bull; 1 cloth bag<br/><br/>The Book of Challenges contains 3 variants for experienced players. Two variants were featured during the Tawantinsuyu Digital World Championship 2021 and are therefore uniquely balanced for 4 players. The third variant is not for the faint of heart, likewise representing an expertly crafted challenge.<br/><br/>Origins: First Builders<br/>&bull; Module: Ophiuchus, the 13th sign of the Zodiac (including a new Zodiac card and accompanying Zodiac tile)<br/>&bull; Module: The Voice (including 5 Voice cards and 1 card with rules)<br/><br/>Ophiuchus lets you choose to resolve the bonus action of an Encounter Site instead of one of the actions normally available.<br/><br/>The Voice gives special powers to the weaker (and, therefore, less desirable) Speaker dice. When taking a Speaker die of value 2 or 3, you may immediately receive the associated benefit depicted on the Voice card before placing the Speaker die in your player area.<br/><br/>Zapotec<br/>&bull; Module: Quick Start (including 10 Quick Start cards and 1 card with rules)<br/><br/>After performing all other setup steps as normal (including starting basic resources), each player is dealt 2 random Quick Start cards from which they will choose 1 card and receive its depicted benefits. Certain Quick Start benefits may even enable a simple Capital action on the first turn.<br/><br/>The Loot Box also contains a special QR code for Escape Tales (containing immersive audio introductions) and 4 custom Scoring markers and a First Player marker for Mandala Stones.<br/><br/>",

This expansion's designers are Klaus-Jürgen Wrede (designer of Carcassonne), Andrew Looney (designer of Fluxx), and the team of Bruno Cathala and Serge Laget (designers of Shadows Over Camelot). Plus there's a bonus solitaire game by Mike Selinker. The games uniquely showcase the personalities of their designers, giving players a wide variety of play experiences.<br/><br/>Nocturne also expands Stonehenge by introducing pieces for sixth and seventh players.

The expansion pack is a new set of four decks of cards and new player sheets to handle the new investments possible. It is unplayable without Cashflow 101.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>Capital Gain Deal cards replace the Small Deal deck.<br/>Cash Flow Deals replace the Big Deal deck.<br/>A new deck of more punishing Doodad cards replaces the 101 Doodad cards. <br/>42 Market cards replace the 101 Market deck.<br/>Stock shorting envelopes for each player for the two major stocks players can make short sales in. (Unfortunately with glue still on the envelope flaps that people will invariably forget and lick shut.)<br/>(4 cassette tapes on investing.)<br/><br/>Major rule changes<br/>Market Deck is now reshuffled after drawing 25 cards, removing the guarantee that all Market cards will be played.<br/>Also, a new rule exists that attempts to fix how the Market deck was under drawn with 2-4 players. Now landing in the Rat Race on either an Opportunity or Market space causes you to draw both a Deal card (your choice still large or small) and a Market card each time.<br/>In the Fast Track, landing on a business you already own allows you to franchise it. Pay the down payment, add an additional token, and receive the additional cashflow listed on the board again.<br/><br/>Players not only start by filling out their sheet with a ?career? as before, but also randomly draw a starting investment portfolio as well.<br/><br/>The game is definitely more chaotic and not as idiot-proof as Cashflow 101, and investments can be entirely wiped out. The game teaches gambling theory and cash management. For instance, if a bet only wins 1 in 20 times, but pays off 50:1 when it does, this is a good bet. The issue then is cash management through the losing cycle placing bets steadily while waiting for the payoff.<br/><br/>",

Leave the die up for everyone to see for the entire round.<br/><br/>Consult the die: <br/>&bull; Calm Seas (Even number of 2,4 or 6 comes up):  Oh how nice... no change at all! You are &quot;even&quot; with the sea. The round is played as normal.<br/><br/>&bull; Tidal Wave (Odd number 3 or 5 comes up):  What the heck happened?  You are &quot;at Odds&quot; with the sea! After selecting cards and running the Get Bit! phase as usual, with the shark biting the swimmer in the back, and the swimmer jumping to the front, the shark then is also moved to the front, reversing the order of the entire line, so the front becomes the back and vice versa.<br/><br/><br/>&bull; Ink Cloud (Squid image comes up):  It's chaos I tell you!  Chaos! For this round, all cards played are randomly chosen, and the Get Bit! phase is skipped.<br/><br/>Sharkspansion Note: The shark also plays a random card, but it has no effect. The Ink Cloud does not cause the shark to &ldquo;miss.&rdquo;<br/><br/>(Squid Die: 6 sides, Numbers 2-6 with one side Ink Cloud icon)<br/><br/>For Walk the Plank:<br/><br/>The die has 6 sides, with The Calm Sea (3 sides), Tidal Wave (2 sides), Kraken (Squid) on one side. It is rolled any time someone falls off the end. Calm Sea nothing happens, Tidal Wave pushes all pirates that are furthest off the plank back toward the ship and Squid would mean anyone on the very last plank is pulled off into the sea by the monster!<br/><br/>",

Ruslan, Prince Ivan, Sinbad, Andromeda, along with the rest of the heroes, will unite to fight against Marid, Sobek, Anubis and the rest of the Dark Lords.  Do not underestimate their power this time!<br/><br/><br/>Ancestors Legacy will provide a much different game through its Plots. There are now seven different Plots for both the first edition and the new one, which will include a background story and will significantly increase the difficulty and excitement of the game &ndash; increasing the amount of decisions that players will have to make. Now, more than ever, team camaraderie will be necessary in order to reach victory! For each of the new Plots, you will discover different and customizable game set-ups.<br/> The biggest challenge of this edition will be comprised of two specific plots which will take the game to an entirely different level. Plots are something completely new for 12 Realms. A Plot may have you playing with six Realms (combining old and new lands), facing all of the Dark Lords, or creating a really fast game with a unique set-up. No matter what your choice will be, Ancestors Legacy will take you to another world where your actions will determine the future of the Fairy lands and all the known Heroes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "6: Siege - The Board Game is an asymmetrical tabletop game with miniatures for 2 to 4 players, based on Ubisoft&rsquo;s acclaimed tactical shooter video game, Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Rainbow Six: Siege.<br/><br/>Year 3 - Hard Breach adds 8 operators to the base game. All of them being from the third year, or the third season, of the video game. They expand upon existing mechanisms and provide different options. And with the expanded roster, you&rsquo;ll have more creative freedom while drafting your squad. Some Operators really benefit from synergies, while others are particularly suited for a specific environment<br/><br/>For attackers, Maverick and Nomad can help their teammates to move with their Orange Destroy ability. Maverick&rsquo;s blowtorch especially enhances his wallbreaching capabilities. Finka and Lion use high-tech, respectively nanobots, to heal allies, or ping enemies with drones.<br/><br/>Defenders are all about preparing the field before the game starts. Evil Eye cameras from Maestro not only surveil, they also shoot! Rtila claws from Ka&iuml;d also deal damage. Clash&rsquo;s shield protects her but also shoots stunning projectiles. Alibi is the least protected of the lot, but is a nightmare to locate with her holo prisma.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "6: Siege - The Board Game is an asymmetrical tabletop game with miniatures for 2 to 4 players, based on Ubisoft&rsquo;s acclaimed tactical shooter video game, Tom Clancy&rsquo;s Rainbow Six: Siege. Gameplay is fast and frenetic, allowing players to feel the tension of a cinematic assault with simulated real-time gameplay. Players control a team of 5 operators (all attackers or all defenders), with each Operator boasting different gadgets and abilities. Building your team of 5 is a very rewarding step of the game, offering endless possibilities and strategic choices. As the attacker, you will use your explosive arsenal to tear down walls and obstacles to reach your objective! As the defender, you will shape the battleground to your advantage and seek to thwart your opponent&rsquo;s plans by denying them chances to attack.<br/><br/>&quot;Map pack 1: Concrete City has the Bank and Kaf&eacute; maps. Bank is all about a claustrophobic and failsafe environment that protects defenders. However, as soon as attackers breach a few walls and get into the thick of the action&hellip; they can benefit from it as well. Kaf&eacute; is quite the opposite: open, with a lot of destructible terrain. No one is safe there. The defenders will need to be nimble, and can&rsquo;t rely on a shield wall, since it&rsquo;s so difficult to hold a position. Of course it will come with a dedicated mission booklet for these maps.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From our earliest years onward, fairytales have an enormous impact on our lives. They entertain us with the daring deeds of colorful heroes and villains. They inspire us to go on adventures of our own and see the world in whole new ways. And they remind us that no matter how dark life gets, there&rsquo;s always hope, always a reason to fight for our dreams. Inspired by the fairytale lore we&rsquo;ve come to love. 12 Realms is a constantly expanding game that offers players the chance to act as fairytale heroes&mdash;everyone from Sinbad to King Arthur to Red Riding Hood, Nutcracker, Snow White, Hansel &amp; Gretel, Pinocchio, Robin Hood and beyond&mdash;facing down villains and interacting with other lively characters and companions. There the players are tasked with leading their beloved heroes through a magical journey full of excitement and danger to save the Realms from the Dark Lords&rsquo; overwhelming hordes. Every hero is represented by a lovingly crafted miniature, already included in the box.<br/> Bedtime Story continues to build on that legacy and brings four new realms: Tang Dynasty, Horrorville, Clockwork Shire and Atlantis. This time Heroes must destroy once and for all the Dark Forces! In Tang Dynasty a god has been born with unlimited power. Player begin their journey from the same realm and they must travel from one land to another but to do that they must destroy the Walls which separate each land. Each Wall has three parts and they can be destroyed by accomplishing different tasks: Find all Artifacts, destroy a Dark Lord or destroy the Black Fortress. When a part of  the Wall is removed, the player who did wins some extra and new Talents: the Green ones. These Talents determine the vulnerability of the player at the end of the game. In each round archers on top of the wall attack and all players lose talents, making the game progressively more difficult! Things will become more challenging... As long as player try to destroy the Wall in a Realm, Invaders take over the rest Active Realms! When you get at the Palace, you must all face the god who born there and then one of you can take that power!<br/><br/>On the other other side of the fairy world, Atlantis is sinking and the flood affects all the rest active Realms. Each time you destroy Invaders the water level rise in more than one Realms and you need more Talents to travel there as for the Invaders, they become more powerful. Save as many people, sacrifice your character and buy some time trying to find the solution and save yourselves. The time is running but in Clockwork Shire there is no time. Pinocchio and Geppetto must work to find all the missing gear wheel and re-activate all the Areas and only then you can attack the Invaders who raid the Realm. Use speed, travel among all the realms and find the correct gear wheel but be careful! Steam Baron will be there and you must face his mechanical skills! Regroup your team, this war is not over yet. A madman is running loose in Horrorville, a doctor who transforms people into beasts. If he transforms them all, you lose, so you must work together and find the cure and then you must find this madman and cure him but he is way to strong!<br/><br/>",

All of them being from the second year, or the second season, of the video game. They expand upon existing mechanisms and provide different options. And with the expanded roster, you&rsquo;ll have more creative freedom while drafting your squad. Some Operators really benefit from synergies, while others are particularly suited for a specific environment<br/><br/>The 4 attackers all have 2 Run and 5 Stamina. No one&rsquo;s super tanky, no one&rsquo;s super nimble. However, all four have abilities that will disrupt defense. Jackal and Dokkaebi are perfect for pinging and revealing enemies. With her Candelas, Ying can stun them while Zofia excels at ranged destruction with her rounds.<br/><br/>On the defenders&rsquo; side, the four profiles are very different. Mira improves defenses from her team at the beginning of the game, but can also pierce ceiling to help Operators shoot from Upstairs&hellip; Lesion and Ela, thanks to their Gu and Grzmot mines, are going to weaken attackers who cross specific thresholds. Vigil, however, will be able to stay in the shadows for as long as he wants, only to appear at the right moment.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This expansion was released in connection with Mayday Games' 2012 Kickstarter campaign for their Deluxe version of Get Bit!.<br/><br/>You will use the Dolphin die for this expansion, as well as the special Dolphin card for each player. At the start of the game, give each swimmer the extra &ldquo;D&rdquo; card for their color, replacing the highest number in your hand. (So the swimmers should have the numbers 1 to however many players there are, plus the Dolphin card.)<br/><br/>When a &ldquo;D&rdquo; card is played, before swimmers are moved, that player rolls the Dolphin die. That player&rsquo;s card is considered to be whatever number was rolled for all purposes, including tying with other dice/cards. Multiple &ldquo;D&rdquo; cards are NOT considered to tie each other unless they roll the same value.<br/><br/>The dolphin comes up if the player rolls a &ldquo;6&rdquo; but it is treated as if the player had played a &quot;9&quot;, and the shark icon is considered a &ldquo;0.&rdquo; As these numbers are not present on cards, they only ever tie if multiple swimmers play their dolphin card in the same round and roll the same icon.<br/><br/>(Dolphin Die: 2, 3, 4, 5, Dolphin(6), Shark/(0))<br/><br/>For Walk the Plank:<br/><br/>This is a single D6 Die that will have on it the numbers 2-5 as well as a number 0 (with a shark) and a number 9 (with a dolphin). This shark/dolphin die would be fun for the first person to lose a man off the edge to roll a single time. If it is a 0 then he loses his guy for good and cannot do anything (eaten by the shark), if a number 2-5 comes in it is good luck for him, he can move that many pirates one length toward the edge of the plank, but cannot use it to push anyone overboard. If the #9 comes up with the dolphin, it is extremely good luck and his man actually gets pushed back onto the plank, but remains on the last plank spot. Additionally no one can play the &quot;shorten the plank&quot; on the round after the #9 comes up to protect this one man for one round.<br/><br/>",

Each card is only as powerful as the story you build around it. No numbers, no dice, just your imagination!<br/><br/>Super Story War is designed to be played on its own, but the cards can be shuffled with other volumes of Story War for even crazier match-ups!&quot;<br/><br/>In each round of play, one player is considered to be the Judge. The Judge draws a Battlefield card, that determines where the battles will take place. The other players split into teams, and play Warrior cards from their hand onto the table. Then the battle commences, with players on each team using their imagination to tell the Judge why their warriors would win in a fight against their opponents, or how they would defend against their opponents' attacks. Examples from the rulebook:<br/><br/>&quot;Police Dog reads you your rights!&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;But the Ninja vanishes into the shadows!&quot;<br/><br/>The Judge is the final arbiter of what is and isn't permissible, and also decides any challenges. Players can also use Item cards from their hand to add more collateral to the fight (&quot;Alien uses this Jetpack to escape!&quot;). When one team is completely defeated, or when the Judge is ready to rule in one side's favor, the round is over. Winning teams keep their used Warriors as victory cards. The game ends when everyone has had a chance to be the Judge once or twice (depending on the number of players), and the teams with the most victory cards is the winner.<br/><br/>",

If he hasn't got exact change for you, he'll give you more money than you gave him. Who can get the best deal?<br/><br/>Game 2: Boneyard There are buckets of money on the table, and it's a silent auction to grab them. Your bids fall back into the buckets, and the first player who can get far enough ahead wins.<br/><br/>Game 3: Diminishing Returns Simple, elegant, and the best of the set. Players start with the same collection of bills, and play money into a common pot until all but one player is out.

Purportedly, the jewel fills the hearts of the people with peace, <br/>protects the entire kingdom from evil, and even has the power to grant immortality.<br/><br/>Sadly, the jewel can&rsquo;t do any of those things, because it is a fake.<br/><br/>The first king of Elorim stole the real jewel.  However, no one noticed at the time.  It may <br/>have seemed odd when the first king disappeared, but his successor became a casuality of <br/>the ensuing monster epidemic.  And the third king soon after, and so forth.<br/><br/>So it wasn&rsquo;t unusual for a king to be missing.<br/><br/>No one thought much about it, until the recent competition for the throne.  As adventurers<br/>made their way into the far reaches of the kingdom, stories began to circulated of a <br/>crowned skeleton clutching a green jewel.<br/><br/>These sightings prompted the clergy to inspect the philosopher&rsquo;s stone, which proved to <br/>be a clever forgery.<br/><br/>Should a warrior such as yourself defeat the lost king and return the true philosopher&rsquo;s <br/>stone, it might put a quick end to the blight of monsters.  It would be mighty impressive <br/>too!<br/><br/>",

Certainly one of the harder titles to track down. This is JZ, a.k.a. WJZ, the game created by WJZ-TV channel 13 in Baltimore, copyrighted by the Robert Goodman agency.<br/><br/>According to AH's Silver Jubilee guide, &quot;WJZ was never in the Avalon Hill line; having been the only game Avalon Hill ever published as a private-label job. [p.25]&quot; Aside from copies retained by Avalon Hill personnel, this game was distributed solely as a promotional item by WJZ-TV in Baltimore, MD (USA).<br/><br/>JZ bills itself as, &quot;The TV ad man's game.&quot; Two to six players compete for high score in the form of advertising accounts and advisory fees. Players can make their accounts more valuable with fortunate advertising time purchases.<br/><br/>Contents for the game are as follows:<br/><br/><br/>     Instruction sheet<br/>     Game board<br/>     2 dice<br/>     6 pawns<br/>     6 strips for marking each accounts' class <br/>     24 pink &quot;Buy Time&quot; cards<br/>     12 green &quot;Regional&quot; account cards<br/>     12 blue &quot;Local&quot; accounts<br/>     8 brown &quot;National&quot; account cards <br/>     2 small cardboard storage inserts<br/><br/><br/>JZ comes in the standard flat box form typical of AH games made in the late 1950s and early 1960s.<br/><br/>The &quot;Buy Time&quot; cards, of course, are an exercise in shameless self-promotion by WJZ's advertising department -- both for the station and its parent company, Westinghouse. Some of the cards are now a bit dated, with references to buying time on the Buddy Deane Show and the Steve Allen Show.<br/><br/>Luck plays a far greater role than skill, as JZ is a simple roll-and-move game. Each player hopes to land on favorable spaces or draw cards that will allow them to land on and upgrade advertising accounts, going along the board until they bail out at &quot;Retirement&quot; or reach &quot;THE BITTER END&quot;. The person with the most valuable advertising portfolio at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Injuries can knock a key player off your roster, forcing you to acquire a replacement.<br/><br/>Shrewd and cunning trades, plus a bit of luck, can either give you the edge to clean up on post season bonuses or to squeak into the financial lead with a cheap non-contender.<br/><br/>",

It is made up of 104 cards, divided into four series of the 26-letter alphabet so that every letter appears four times, once in each suit.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 10 cards, and a turn is as in many rummy games: draw, play, and discard.  An initial play must include a word and either a run or set of letters; after that players can use their to to play more runs, sets and words, and/or add to existing ones. A draw can only be done from the discard pile if the card can be used in a meld, and all the discards above it in the pile are added to the hand.  Sets and runs score the sum of the values of their letters, as do words, but words also have bonuses: letters beyond 4 are doubled; a word of one color is double, while a word of one suit is trebled.<br/><br/>When a player empties their hand, all other players subtract the value of the cards in their hand from their score. All cards on the table stay there, while all the others (in hands, deck, and discard pile) are shuffled together for another hand, in which players must still do a new opening play before playing to cards on the table.  After there are no cards left in the deck, and a player empties their hand, then the game ends with the highest score winning.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to will your 7 marbles to land on top of one of several holes, each with a different point value. The game board rests at a slight angle so the marbles will gather near the bottom, in the Brier Patch, if they don't settle on a point value. After all of your marbles have been launched, you tally up your score to compare with others. There is also a ZIP! spot that allows you to relaunch a marble.<br/><br/>The name Zip! was likely incorporated as Uncle Remus was the character who sang the song &quot;Zip-a-dee-doo-dah&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The words &quot;WHO&quot; &quot;HAS&quot; &quot;THE&quot; make up the third, forth and fifth line, and score 5 points for the player playing the the last letter in each word respectively. The word &quot;BUTTON?&quot; makes up the sixth line and scores 10 points to the player playing the question mark. The tile with the picture of a button makes up the seventh line and is worth 20 points. The first player to score 100 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

When struck correctly, each hammer will flip to the opponent&rsquo;s side. When a player has all the hammers on his opponent&rsquo;s side, he or she must push a red knob to lock the hammers and freeze the action, scoring points.

The (two) Koala brothers and four of their friends appear on six red counters and their preferred means of transport are represented on five blue counters (the koala brothers fly a twin seater plane).<br/><br/>At the start of the game the counters are mixed up, one of the red ones removed, and the remaining ten distributed at random between the houses.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to roll a special die and take actions accordingly:<br/><br/>&bull;    If it shows a number then the player moves a piece of his choice the number of free spaces indicated on the die.  Movement can be in either a clockwise or anticlockwise direction.<br/>&bull;    If it shows an eye the player can secretly look at a counter of his/her choice.<br/>&bull;    If it shows an arrow the player selects a playing piece of his/her choice and turns it up so that everyone can see.<br/><br/>Players may also gamble tokens by secretly peeking at counters.  If the counter is at the right house then it wins tokens, if not it loses tokens.<br/><br/>Play proceeds until all the friends and their vehicles are face up in the right location.  The player with the greatest number of tokens is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A childrens action Roulette game.<br/><br/>The game is essentially a circular roulette style plastic dish with a central dimpled scoring track surrounding a &quot;bullseye&quot; track.  Using the corner mounted spring loaded shooters the aim of the game is to shoot your plastic balls (green or yellow) into the roulette wheel aiming to score as many points as possible.<br/><br/>The version I have includes 4 different scorecards which sit in the center straddling the &quot;bullseye&quot; track.  The games are  aceball, cannonball, cue ball, and fruitball each having its own scoring system<br/><br/>Aceball - Probably the most advanced game variant having a rising multiplier style score for face cards and picture cards, bullseye track representing a joker.<br/><br/>Cannonball - My personal favorite, rising scores nearer the center of a ship, gaps between ships score 0 and the bullseye scores 25.<br/><br/>Cueball - Based on a snooker scoring system with 1 point for reds and rising values for the colored balls , &quot;bullseye&quot; track representing a pocketed cue ball and no score.<br/><br/>Fruitball - A fruitmachine scoring system with points awarded for tricks of three same symbols.<br/><br/>The copy I have is incomplete (as far as I can tell) and I cannot tell you how many balls came with the game nor any of the exact rules as these were printed on the inside of the box lid which has long since disappeared.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the box:<br/><br/>Hook Line &amp; Sinker is an easy to play, fun game that will entertain the entire family and you don't have to be a fisherman to enjoy playing Hook Line and Sinker. It is a game of chance that depicts most aspects of a day's fishing in a boat. In the box are 82 colorful playing cards representing ten varieties of fish. Each fish is worth a set amount of points from the low scoring Garfish to the mighty Marlin which can score you 100 points. Every cast of the dice will put you in an hilarious and exciting fishing predicament. The winner is the person who catches the most amount of fish with the highest points score, which means you can finish last around the board and still win the game. Try fishing in the lounge room, it's sure to get you in, Hook Line and Sinker.<br/><br/>",

The game consists of a game board, four dogs and a cassette tape. The dogs are set up on the board, then the tape is played. The players follow the instructions on the tape, as in &quot;Dog X! Move forward two squares!&quot; or &quot;All dogs on yellow squares move back one square!&quot; etc.<br/><br/>There are also some large plastic bones which have to be hidden or searched in other rooms than the ones the game takes place in. While one player is out for that task, the others continue - so the player outside should hurry.  This unique &amp; exciting game can be played at many different levels of difficulty &amp; has numerous permutations of game play. You can start the game anywhere through the one hour tape !<br/><br/>",

If it is a helper chip, they place it the sky path and move Stellaluna one space forward. If it is not, they turn it back over again and leave it in place. When Stellaluna reaches home, all players win! There is a more advanced ruleset for older players.<br/><br/>This game is intended to teach young players to develop memory and story-telling skills as well as important social skills: taking turns, following rules, sharing and respecting others.<br/><br/>",

Once all the pieces have been placed they are moved alternately either to an adjacent empty space or by jumping over an adjacent piece; multiple jumps can be made as long as empty spaces exist.  As each piece makes its first move it is turned upright so that the name shows.  If a player is able to get a piece to the city on the map that matches the name tag of the piece then he turns it back over to signify it no longer moves.<br/><br/>If a player can be the first to have only his units present in cities of his home country then the game ends and that player is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Millions of years in the future, admits a universe dying a cold, premature death, mankind has overcome great challenges. They have conquered and outlived every alien race. They have overthrown a millennial reign of a cruel quasi-immortal tyrant. They have occupied all the remaining habitable galaxies of the Universe. But their greatest challenge is now themselves. The Human species has evolved into two different peoples: the Morlocks and the Eloi. And now they battle each other to determine which of them shall be masters of the universe.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;One player plays the space fleets of the Eloi. The Eloi are a gentle, yet determined people, under the vigilant care of their Empress. They seek to liberate the six galaxies from the cruel Morlocks. One player plays the space fleets of the Morlock Empire. The Morlocks are a fierce and technologically advance people. The only way they wish to serve the Eloi, is on their dinner tables. Each player uses an identical deck of cards. Six sided dice will also be required.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;Goal: To win, one player must possess all six of the inhabitable galaxies of the Universe. To capture (or recapture) a galaxy card, one must win a battle by destroying all of the opponent&rsquo;s ships.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from instructions)<br/><br/>&quot;Megamerger is a game where industrial empires are built through strategy and finesse, by merging single industries into powerful conglomerates.  Players acquire control of selected industries, collecting higher fees as their empires become more powerful.  Along the &quot;Road to Riches&quot; they find greater challenge as opponents build competing conglomerates and as each one formulates strategies for financial supremacy.&quot;<br/><br/>In MegaMerger players move around the board buying up shares in various industries. They can own anywhere from 5% of an industry, up to 100% in an industry. Players want to control many industries in the same color in order to make a &quot;conglomerate&quot; which will help them expand how much money they get from players who land on their industries.<br/><br/>However, just because a player owns a part of an industry does not prevent it from being bought by another player. Unlike Monopoly, as long as the player has something, they are in the game. This could be as little as 5% ownership in an industry with no money in front of them.<br/><br/>",

Scenarios such as the &quot;Attack on the Outposts&quot;, &quot;Seige of the Frontiers&quot;, &quot;Plunder Raids of the Brain Slaves&quot;, etc. This is a detailed comparison of what occured in the BFA &quot;Deliverance from Beyond the Stars&quot;.<br/><br/><br/> <br/><br/>        Geomorphic Map&mdash;Sections, Hardbacked, solid boards, each one 11x14 inches, can be combined into a 22x28-inch mapboard, or a 44x14-inch, 64x11-inch mapboard, or any other combination. The Boards here have 9 different kinds of Space Obstacles and Vortexes. The amazing thing about WD boards is that the four boards in this game can be connected to the mapboards of other WD games, and ALL WD GAMES have their boards so made that they can be interconnected with all the other WD versions. Counters are on 8 1/2 x 11-inch large sheets showing the weapons systems in detail that the silhouettes on the BFA counters only implied. THIS GAME CAN BE PLAYED BY ONE OR MORE PEOPLE (UP T0 11 can play). Each player handles one ship. Sun Slayers specializes in OutPosts, Beacons, Omega Ships, Monitors; all are enclosed and utilize the drama of the long-term duties of the Star Forces in the  defensive OutPosts that might be raided at any time to poke a hole into Federation territory, for Taal Battle Cruisers to rush through and how fast Thetan and Alliance ships can rush to the aid of the Defensive Line.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "China Doll is an action game based on the short film &lsquo;China Doll&rsquo;. Choose between four mafia families from New York City&rsquo;s Chinatown and Little Italy battle to take over the sacred Xin-Lu sword and slaughter other player&rsquo;s family members.<br/><br/>The game is composed of the following cards:<br/>Family, Character, Action, Immediate and one Xin-Lu Sword Card.<br/>The purpose of the game is to posses the Xin-Lu Sword card, fighting for it and/or stealing it.<br/>The player who has the Xin-Lu sword and kills all other player&rsquo;s family members is the winner. If a player has the Xin-Lu sword and all his or her family members are killed, he or she also wins (because no-one else will ever find it).<br/>So whether you kill everyone or everyone kills you, as long as you have the sword, you win.<br/><br/>You may play up to 3 cards during each turn. It is recommendable to play at least 1 character card to defend your self against attacks. Character cards have 3 different numbers (red, green and white) that will determine their value depending on who they are fighting against. You may only use characters that belong to your family.<br/><br/>This game is ideally played with 2 to 3 players (specially 3 players), but can also be played with 4 to 5 players if two decks are mixed together and used.<br/><br/>",

It includes all the small details that make this sport so amazing, such as the ancient traditional team selection, two-wall shots, and even jumping off the wall in order to reach a high ball.<br/>It is played on a accurate small-scale replica of a cancha/fronton (Jai Alai court) with a grid.<br/>During each turn the player rolls a special &quot;DosDados&quot; roll to move, catches the ball, selects the distance and rolls another &quot;DosDados&quot; to determine the total and finally chooses the direction of the ball.<br/>It is a fast-paced game with plenty strategy and excitement. The objective of the game is similar to that of tennis. For example; if your opponent does not reach the ball before the second bounce, it will be a point in your favour.<br/>The game is played with two teams of two pelotaris (Jai Alai players) and can be played with 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "TowerRun is a standard issue Open License Print and Play Dungeon Crawl Adventure Game for 1 (solo) to 4 players. It attempts to make use of several distinguishing mechanics.<br/><br/>First, no DM player is required. All monsters obey simple AI/automatic rules, which can be performed by anybody willing to do it. Second, dungeon crawl games often take a very long time to play due to a lot of dice rolling. TowerRun attempts to minimize this by eliminating dice rolling wherever possible, including during combat. The (hopeful) end result is not only a faster game, but a more strategic method of play. Third, there is a built in &ldquo;score&rdquo; system that single or multiple players can attempt to beat whenever they play. The game is not designed to be &ldquo;beaten&rdquo; on the first attempt, so multiple attempts are necessary, and each time you can try and beat your previous high score. Finally, a core mechanic of the game revolves around random pairings of objects and enchantments. Quite often objects have unknown enchantments that can be revealed in a calculated or risky method. Players do not know what the enchantments are until they use the item, but if they use the item without first identifying it they run the risk of it being cursed.<br/><br/>These mechanics make for heightened tension, faster game play, and a depth of balance and strategy.<br/><br/>",

It promotes laughter, enlightenment, insight and growth &mdash; both spiritual and personal.<br/><br/>Quite amazingly, 'Satori' gives us the exact insights we need to move beyond vicitimhood and to heal our lives. The game mirrors for us our own wisdom in having created the very circumstances of our own healing. It leads us to where we can reframe the past and see the perfection in it. It can be prophetic in showing us issues we didn&rsquo;t even know we had. And It connects us to the truth of who we are. It&rsquo;s quite a game!<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE<br/><br/>The goal is to proceed through four levels of consciousness in order to get to Satori &mdash; total awareness.<br/><br/>EVENT AND CONTEXT CARDS<br/><br/>Each player picks an Event card and a Context card. (9 times out of 10 these are a direct hit on an issue the person needs to work on). Each player in turn creates a victim story around that situation and places his/her playing piece in Victimland to start the game.<br/><br/>THE LANDING SPACES<br/><br/>Of course the journey is one fraught with difficulties and repleat with blessings, depending upon which space you land.  The landing spaces will direct you to look at your beliefs, blocks, karma, stories and projections etc., with instructions or by drawing cards.<br/><br/>NEW STORY CARDS<br/><br/>These help you shift out of your victim story - with all its negative beliefs and energy blocks, and move into a new story.<br/><br/>'SATORI'<br/><br/>No matter who gets there first, we want for everyone else to come to Satori. At that point, each player gets a chance to reframe their story and to read an affirmation.<br/><br/>THE RESULTS<br/><br/>People report feeling lighter, feeling free from pain or the weight of guilt and anger, more compassionate and more loving.<br/><br/>",

Each option plays differently, with varying numbers of warriors and unique special units employing awesome powers that can completely change the game.<br/><br/>Any relatively smooth table can serve as the eponymous Field of Slaughter.  Strike quickly and strike true, or death awaits from an enemy with a better plan!<br/><br/>",

Second, when a checker has made it across the board, it is not &quot;kinged&quot; to return to play, but instead remains in the &quot;King's Row.&quot;***  At the end of the game, the player who can put together the best poker hand from the checkers that have traversed the board wins the game.<br/><br/>This game is something of a mystery.  It comes in a Monopoly-sized box, with a heavy board and very heavy-duty checkers, but no publisher or designer is listed on the game.<br/><br/><br/>            Correction: a checker in the King's Row may be moved out of King's Row to remove opponent's pieces, but may not be compelled to do so.

        "description": "Subtitle: Being In The Main a Preoccupation For The Better Sort of Chap, &amp; Making Full Use of Classic Toy Soldiers (Which The Pedants Call &quot;54mm&quot;)<br/><br/>Publisher's description:<br/><br/>Written in part as a tribute to HG Wells ground breaking  Little Wars , FLW is a much expanded and broadened modernization. There is a fascinating chapter devoted to Wells the Man and his journey with his &quot;Little Wars&quot; from inception to the day in 1916 when he put the game away for good. For fans of Wells' work, The Padre may surprise you with information you did not know, or could even guess.<br/><br/>Retaining many of Wells' original rules (such as the use of spring-loaded toy cannon), there are now additional rules for Shell Bursts, machine guns, observation balloons and aircraft, field hospitals, supply wagons and dumps, spies, military bands, unit Colors and Standards, Brigade up to Division Commands, hidden movement, skirmishers, snipers, unpredictable effects of terrain, signals, morale, and much more.<br/><br/>Infantry units are a standard 20 figures strong, Cavalry 12, and Artillery can appear as single Guns with crews, or as Batteries of up to three strong. From two to four such units, with a Battery, typically form a Brigade, the perfect command for each Player. Two or more Brigades form a Division, and this is the post for the Player who will act as Commanding Officer for his side.<br/><br/>Each Brigade and the Divisional HQ is represented by a variable number of Staff and ADC's, marching on foot, mounted on prancing steeds, or even seated in Rolls Royce, Cadillac, Renault, or other grand Staff Cars from the Golden Age of Motoring. From these HQ's must come the orders to the units on the firing line, but the traffic isn't all one way! Back to the Brigadiers and the Commanding General, come the reports of the scouts--and the desperate messages from the front lines delivered by Runners, Gallopers, and even Pigeons! There is far more skill than luck required to lead your miniature minions to victory, and the rules provide this without complicated systems. In many respects, there is far less abstraction in Funny Little Wars in the spaces of your garden than there is on the traditional table top.<br/><br/>While designed for yard games, the rules can be played on the floor or table top. Figures used can range from antique and modern &quot;Collectibles,&quot; to readily available plastics. Included are detailed lists for 14 different Armies identified by their &quot;Colors,&quot; (&quot;Army Red,&quot; &quot;Army Black,&quot; &quot;Army Red/Gold,&quot; etc) with complete information on how to build your favorites. Each Army has its unique strengths and weaknesses, and a personality which will definitely suggest its historical counterpart.<br/><br/>Much as Wells' rules did, FLW covers the quarter century prior to WW I, when war was still romantic, the uniforms were dashing, and the Generals still waltzed. This is the very era that gave birth to the Military Pentathalon, and a player may find himself having to excel in one or more of its challenges to deliver a crucial dispatch! Padre Paul's rules reflect the late Victorian and Edwardian spirit in both the substance of the rules and the delightful style of his writing. Designed for &quot;The Better Sort of Chap,&quot; the book contains suggestions for proper Dress during the game, etiquette on the field, and more. Nor are the Ladies and &quot;Girls of the better sort&quot; forgotten. The Padre's Wife, Georgina, provides a charming account of a &quot;proper dinner&quot; served after an especially Gentlemanly game at Dover Castle one recent Summer.<br/><br/>Not only are there the Basic Rules, but many Optional Rules allowing players to set their own levels of play. There are lists of providers of toy soldiers in every price range, as well as all manner of accessories, and recommendations on how to shop inexpensively on the Internet for those items you will not find so readily in the stores. Sections describe how to set up a yard, park, rockery, beach, or other site to be your Battlefield. For once, you WILL have room to perform that wide flanking maneuver! Light Cavalry and Infantry come into their own, screening your forces while trying to detect your enemy's. Once more, War Gaming is as much fun as when any of us discovered the hobby, no matter how many years--or decades!--ago.<br/><br/>Rules for basing figures are flexible and encourage players to work with what is best for their needs. And while comprehensive, there are no complex rules or formulae, and nothing more than traditional six-sided dice are required--besides measuring tapes and a beautiful day under the shade of the trees. Childlike, but never &quot;Childish,&quot; FLW goes back to the Hobby's roots, and even our own as we play once more with the toy soldiers so many us first had as kids.<br/><br/>",

It is based on a simplified version of the &quot;Wargames Rules for Armoured Warfare 1950-1985&quot;, published by the Wargames Research Group (WRG) in 1979. It is played on a terrain model using miniatures representing single vehicles, infantry sections, and crew-served weapons. Players adopt the roles of commanders of platoon or company sized groups. The game requires at least a neutral player in the role of controller, who sets the scenario, supervises play and resolves disputes. Combat is resolved by percentile dice rolls on probability tables, modified by range, suppression status, movement and terrain.<br/><br/>Editor John Curry added some weapon tables for the British and American Army, and additional information and order of battles for Canadian, Warsaw Pact and British forces.<br/><br/>",

Terra Shrinka has a unique lunar tide system that controls the water and will erode the island if you don't work together to scout out the island, gather resources, and build dams fast enough.<br/><br/>THE STORY SO FAR<br/><br/>On a South Pacific flight your plane is struck by lighting and makes an emergency landing on a small desert island.  The good news is that everyone survived the landing, the bad news is that the tides are rising and the island is flooding.  It's up to the brave passengers to step forward and bring order to the chaos.  You survived the crash, now can you survive the flood?  The very earth is shrinking around you!  Can you dam the flood?<br/><br/>THE OBJECTIVE<br/><br/>Dam the flood by creating an unbroken chain of dams from one board edge to the other and protect the crash-site in the process!<br/><br/>HOW THE GAME PLAYS<br/><br/>The game starts with the board taking its turn. The board&rsquo;s turn is broken into five phases:<br/><br/>1. Move Moon Tracker<br/>2. Add Flood Cube(s)<br/>3. Roll Moon Die that matches current Moon Phase<br/>4. Draw card if &ldquo;N&rdquo; or &ldquo;S&rdquo; is rolled.<br/>5. Move Flood water and resolve damage<br/><br/>After the water does a good job of destroying board squares, it is the players&rsquo; turn. Each player starts with their Team Leader in the Crash Site. During the players&rsquo; turn, they do the following:<br/><br/>1. Explore and Move<br/>2. Create<br/>3. Transfer<br/>4. Set Dams<br/><br/>Each player has a starting character. Are you the ren-faire blacksmith, or are you the bag lady? No matter whom, it is each team&rsquo;s job to explore this uncharted little island. The survivors find food to bribe more recruits off the plane. They make networks of people to transfer gathered goods. And finally, they create and set dams to stop the water. This requires lots of communication and teamwork to protect your Crash Site and stop the water from spreading any more. If your Crash Site is destroyed, you lose. Otherwise, keep track of how many squares were destroyed when you finally blocked off the flood and try to do better next time. There are additional scenarios to add replay value and ensure that you want to come back for more.<br/><br/>",

They make use of strategically deployed armies and barricades, occupy neutral cities to control their resources, and fight their way across the battlefield to capture their opponent's capital.<br/><br/>Fyrdwisa is a turn-based strategy game in which players spend action points and reveal resource cards to perform actions. Depending on the neutral cities they control, players receive between 1 and 6 action points each turn. Players may save action points from turn to turn (up to 12 points) to perform special actions or execute sudden military maneuvers. Depending on the number of players, there are up to 4 neutral cities for players to attack. Each city's resource is revealed when it is first occupied. The game includes cards for 10 possible city resources (which are assigned randomly) so each game plays out differently. When attacked, neutral cities may &quot;bribe&quot; players into retreating by providing them with a single-use special resource card.<br/><br/>Fyrdwisa is played on a cloth game board printed with a hexagonal battlefield. Each hexagon is divided into six triangles, in which players place small glass game pieces. Action point counters are printed in the corners of the game board, to assist in tracking available points each turn. City resources are printed on heavy stock paper cards.<br/><br/>",

Top Cat's plan is to dress up as Santa, and stand in front of shop entrances collecting money. After all, everybody would like to help a poor hungry kitty at Christmas time!&quot;<br/><br/>Each player controls a member of Top Cat's gang. Players start the game with 3 cards representing a Santa costume (Beard, Hat and Cloak), but can lose and gain these items of clothing as a consequence of various game events. To collect cash, a player must be in the possession of a full Santa outfit and end their turn on a money square (shop entrance).<br/><br/>Top Cat's nemesis - Officer Dibble - moves around the board after each player's turn. If Officer Dibble lands on a player, the player loses all of the cash that they're currently carrying. Cash can, however, be safely deposited in the player's home square (a trash can).<br/><br/>Several event cards allow the players to attempt to &quot;spoof&quot; another player. &quot;Spoofing&quot; involves a bluffing/guessing game in which players have to guess how many coins the other player is concealing in his hands. The winner takes the loser's cash, and can also steal an item from the loser's Santa Costume.<br/><br/>The first player to collect 10 coins and purchase the prize hamper from the food shop wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Object Of The Game:<br/><br/>The object of the game is for a player, or partners, to be the first to complete the four corners of a square of any size with pegs of his own color. Such a square is called a King-Square. The first player, or partners, to complete five such King-Squares have won the game.<br/><br/>Instructions For Two Players:<br/><br/>Opposing players use different sets of colored pegs. Players take turns alternately in playing a peg in any unoccupied position of the playing field. They continue to do so until one player has completed a the four corners of a square with pegs of his own color. As soon as a King-Square has been made the successful player records the square on his score board. All the pegs are then removed from the playing field and the loser starts play to build another King-Square. This process is repeated after each square is completed until one player has build five such squares with pegs of his own color. The first player to to do so has won the game.<br/><br/>Building King-Square<br/><br/>The first player to complete the four corners of a square with pegs of his own color has a King-Square. It makes no difference how many pegs of his own color, or of his opponent, are inside this square - or on the sides of the square - or in between his pegs on the four corners of the square - all that matters is that all the pegs on the four corners of the square are pegs of his own color.<br/><br/>Squares made at an angle do not count. A King-Square must be parallel to the sides of the playing field and the rows and columns of holes. A square must be made up of four sides of equal length. A square is a figure having four equal sides and four right angles. A rectangle is not a square.<br/><br/>Partnership play - four players<br/><br/>As in Bridge, four players can play as two pairs of partners, each pair sitting opposite each other. Each pair uses pegs of the same color, dividing the pegs between them at the start of the game. All four players take turns alternately in placing their pegs, going clockwise around the table. As soon as a King-Square has been made it is recorded and a new square is started. As with two players, the game is won by the partners who are first to complete five King-Squares.<br/><br/>",

The U.S.S.R. launched a multi-stage ballistic missile earlier in the year and the U.S., not wanting to fall behind in the missile race, launches its first ICBM on December 17th.  Soon the world is blasted to ruins and only small pockets, isolated from the destruction and ensuing radioactive fallout, prove habitable over the long term. And between those pockets, battles rage between gangs of survivors (The 8th Avenue Greasers, The Michigan State Bowling League, and others) and rogue military units. All of them seeking food, fuel, or a place free of radiation.<br/><br/>Game Play: Players compete and combat for possession of the remaining resources among the nuclear wastes.  Player activate their gangs by random card activation.  Encounter markers are used to designate various sites to search.  Combat is fast and bloody between the players, or with wandering with RadZombies, Mutated men, animals and insects.  Final victory is determined by the exiting of these few precious items off the board.<br/><br/>",

It is played on an 8x8 hexagonal board with 16 pieces on each side, that have movement very similar to those in Chess, and are abstract as in Chess. The goal of Metapontum is for both sides to exchange their pieces from their chosen opening setup to their chosen end setup in a minimum amount of moves. On every turn, a player can either move one of his pieces or exchange one of his pieces with one of his opponent's, as long as his piece has line of sight to the other.<br/><br/>Frenkel's web site sells various game boards made out of either cardboard, wood or stone. Frenkel claims that all games are produced under fair trade practices.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The word &quot;chametz&quot; is Hebrew and refers to the food items and derivatives that are prohibited during the week of the Jewish holiday Passover (usually bread and other items containing five prohibited grains: barley, wheat, oat, rye and spelt).  Egregious examples of chametz include pizza, donuts, cookies, cupcakes, pretzels, and crackers.  &quot;Chametz: The Search is On!&quot; is played similarly to &quot;Clue&quot; but instead of deducing a murder, the players must determine which character left which item of chametz in which room.  It's especially appropriate because Jewish law requires families to search their home and clean it of all chametz before Passover begins.<br/><br/>The board is a blueprint of a house with six rooms (kitchen, bedroom, dining room, living room, office and garage).  There are also six items of food and six characters.<br/><br/>Eighteen cards are included (one for each character, food and room).  After separating the cards into the 3 categories and secretly hiding one character, one food and one room in the small envelope provided, the remaining cards are shuffled and then dealt out to the entire group, clockwise, until all cards are gone.  Players may begin in any room as long as they choose it before seeing their cards.  They take turns rolling a six-sided die to determine how far they can walk around the perimeter of the home (with entrances off the main spaces).<br/><br/>Upon entering a room, players may make a guess as to the hidden person, food and room.  The player to their left may prove them wrong by showing a card in their hand that matches one of the items in the guess. If that player has no matches, the guess goes to the next person.  If nobody has a match, the player can check the hidden cards to see if they're right.<br/><br/>Players do not have to write with pen or pencil (another prohibition for Jews on the Sabbath and Holidays) and instead place cardboard markers in a noteboard with 18 slots (one for each item).<br/><br/>The cardboard markers can be placed in the slot in such a way as to &quot;point&quot; left, right or up, and may be used to remind yourself who showed you that particular item.<br/><br/>There are 4 mandatory &quot;Question Squares&quot; on the board and 4 optional ones.  When landing on these squares, the player is read a question from the stack of Question Cards based on another roll of the die (each Question Card has True/False, Multiple Choice and Fill-in-the-Blank versions of the question).  A roll of 1 or 2 gets the easier True-False version, and 5 or 6 gets the hardest Fill-in-the-Blank version.  The questions pertain to Passover and Jewish History.<br/><br/>After answering correctly, the player may immediately jump to any room on the board and make a guess.  There are no secret passageways between rooms otherwise.<br/><br/>First player to guess the hidden character, food and room wins.  To play with 2 players, one card is placed face down in each room before dealing the cards out.  So when entering a room, the player may choose to make a guess or look at the face-down card (it's essentially a 3rd player who shows one of their cards when you enter each room).<br/><br/>",

Each one of you has to build total, 5 buildings in the 3 different sectors of the board (Mainframe). The Mainframe is divided in the Grey, the Red and the Gold Sector. You have to build 2 Constructions in each sector and 1 in the Gold and last one. The Buildings come to your possession through the Architectonic Plans. Each Sector hides unique constructions but traps too as well as it offers a variety of choices.<br/><br/>Your rival Architects won't allow you to reach the gold and they will use all the means of the game such as the Hazard Cards. Using them, can seriously damage your constructions. On the other hand, the Mainframe wouldn't let you exposed, to them. That's why it offers the Construction Assurances. Thanks to these cards you will be protected, however, up to a point. Still, your rivals can use the Grids, obstacles that they place on the Mainframe and specifically in the area where you build and can delay you a lot. Place your pawn on the Pavement (outer board), draw your Plans, buy raw materials, hire the necessary Groups of Workers, get the License of your Construction and start building. But be careful, if you cheat, then the Construction Inspector will lead you out of the Mainframe. Since you complete your building, you collect a standard payment as well as different bonuses matching the different board-combinations where the Mainframe offers to you.<br/><br/>Maybe this game seems easy and known but Biruda offers innovative mechanisms where you will meet duing the play. To prove yourself among the other and be the Master Architect you have to move with caution. The Pavement around gives to all the chance to draw different card sets and these cards will be proved veru useful during your work. Still this game differs a lot thanks to its variations such the board pieces of the Mainframe where you can connect them in different ways and reform the whole city. Among the Hazards, there are Earthquake Cards and based on their effects you can change totally the game. The most important here is that even if a rival Architect has managed to reach the Gold Sector and you are far behind, well with a single move you can restore the balance and be the winner.<br/><br/>THE MAINFRAME IS NOW OPEN!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Whirred PLAY&trade; - &lsquo;The Holy Grail of Family Board Games&rsquo;<br/><br/>What is Whirred PLAY&trade;?<br/><br/>Whirred PLAY&trade; is a unique word game designed so that anyone can win regardless of their vocabulary and designed so that everyone can play together no matter the composition or size of the family or social group.<br/><br/>Reason Whirred PLAY&trade; was Developed<br/><br/>Whirred PLAY&trade; was developed because existing board games did not satisfy a need to be able to play a game with the whole family where everyone was challenged and mentally stimulated, but where everyone had an equal chance of winning. Games of chance such as &lsquo;snakes and ladders&rsquo; and &lsquo;ludo&rsquo; can be won by anyone, but they do not offer a lot in the way of mental stimulation for those taking part and soon the thrill of being able to play a board game together as a family diminishes.<br/>More intricate family board games such as &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; do provide the level of mental stimulation required. However, one is much more likely to win these games if one has more life experience (to be able to play strategically) and more education (knowledgeable about a subject). As a consequence younger family members, or those with self perceived lower life skills, shy away from playing these games because they always expect to get beaten.<br/><br/>In order to encourage these groups of people to join in, adults will often have to play below their best to give them a chance to win and to maintain their interest in playing the game. Whilst this is fun for a while, it soon becomes difficult for the adult to gain enough satisfaction from playing the game from the levels of satisfaction achieved by seeing their offspring&rsquo;s delight at winning.<br/><br/>How is Whirred PLAY&trade; Unique?<br/><br/>So Whirred PLAY&trade; enables everyone to play a game at their own level of skill and strategy, but whatever their level this does not determine whether or not they are more or less likely to win. Whirred PLAY&trade; is open for any number of players to join in at the same time, so unlike when playing &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; (maximum four players) or &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; (maximum six players), no member of the family or social group need sit on the sidelines. Everyone can join in the fun.<br/><br/>Additionally, Whirred PLAY&trade; is designed so that at all times in the game everyone always has a chance of winning, no matter their position on the board, until the eventual winner crosses the finishing line. In games such as &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly&rsquo; there will come a point where it is obvious certain players are not going to win.  Some participants may decide that they will leave the game at this point and that can have a detrimental effect on the pleasure of all parties involved in playing the game. This also may become a hindrance for future participation from those who have departed early. A special feature of Whirred PLAY&trade; is an element of the game called &lsquo;Pare Up&rsquo;, especially designed to provide ample opportunity for players to bring the leader back to the chasing pack.<br/><br/>Another element of Whirred PLAY&trade; that ensures maximum interest from all parties is that any particular game should last no more than 30 minutes. &lsquo;Scrabble&rsquo; and &lsquo;Monopoly, in particular, can run on for long periods of time and this can be a barrier for those with shorter attention spans, usually children, to want to take part. And with over 440 cards in Whirred PLAY&trade;, there is very little repetitiveness, as a typical game usually only utilises 30 to 40 cards.<br/><br/>Additionally, the game play of Whirred PLAY&trade; is designed so that everyone is participating all at the same time. No-one has to wait for any one particular player to finish their turn, which in some other family board games can often be quite a long time.<br/><br/>Whirred PLAY&trade; is Educational<br/><br/>As Whirred PLAY&trade; is based on the simple premise of spelling everyday words that just happen to be homophones, a key stage two literacy curriculum topic, it has high appeal amongst both parents and teachers as an excellent fun method of teaching children this difficult subject. Children will want to play Whirred PLAY&trade; because of all of the elements of inclusivity and equality listed above, and parents will be delighted that a game they want to play offers more than just a fun half hour.<br/><br/>Schools can utilise Whirred PLAY&trade; in formal teaching classes due to its all inclusive nature and the ability for the whole class to participate in it, with an equal chance of winning it, at the same time regardless of its size or composition. The competitive nature of Whirred PLAY&trade; especially appeals to boys, traditionally a more difficult group of students to enthuse about learning how to spell.<br/><br/>Whirred PLAY&trade; - &lsquo;The Holy Grail of Family Board Games&rsquo;<br/><br/>So Whirred PLAY&trade; really is a board game like no other. Everyone can take part, everyone has an equal chance of winning, everyone can apply their own level of strategy and utilise their own level of life experience, everyone is involved at all times, everyone can win at all times during the game, no-one gets bored, everyone gets educated and everyone has fun.<br/><br/>",

With a mixture of strategy, action, control of risk, and some touches of role, FQ3 represents a real way (and funny too), all that happens inside and outside of the tracks.<br/><br/>&quot;FQ3&quot; has 3 difficulty levels of rules to satisfy all kind of players;<br/><br/>- BASIC RULES: Aimed at casual and undemanding gamers.<br/><br/>- ADVANCED RULES: For fans of race games. These rules are more realistic, and involved all sorts of factors: such as types of tires, fuel loads, setting the car, kers, yellow flag, Safety Car, moral of drivers and injuries, etc.<br/><br/>- MANAGER MODE: Only for those who  drink gasoline! In this game mode, in addition to the role of pilot, you will assume the role of team manager. You will manage the economy, hiring drivers, sponsors, engineers, desing the car and evolve it. The years pass and drivers will gain experience and they will improve their skills.<br/><br/>SUMMARY OF GAMEPLAY: The Friday of the GP, the player must decide the strategy (number of stops, tires, and fuel load).<br/><br/>On Saturday, will be held the pole position, it follows a mathematical operation involving various modifiers (skills of the pilot, car performance, fuel load, tires, moral, blunders, and a roll of 1d20).<br/><br/>The race takes place the Sunday.<br/>The circuit is composed of squares. The cars will go moving by circuit as many squares as the speed (gear dependent) of your car.<br/>When the cars reach the corners, the drivers must brake and accelerate. Brakes and accelerates with a d100. Drivers have an ability to Brake and Accelerate that used to take curves (higher or lower depending on driver).<br/>These skills will be modified by the fuel load, tire types, and how close you decide to brake and accelerate.<br/>The risk you take in the curves is important; you can take away your opponents, but be careful!, fail brake roll or acceleration roll will damage your car.<br/><br/>The game stands on four pillars:<br/>The driver, the car, the pit stop mechanics, and the circuit.<br/>Each of them has many different skills, qualities or details that make it different from the others.<br/><br/>This is a brief summary of how to play. There are many and funny rules, such as kers, spin, overtaking, blunders, drivers' virtues, drive's defects, safety car,etc.<br/><br/>",
