These horses are given &quot;odds&quot; to win. The Banker then gives a large pointer a spin which has the horses names on the board and when it comes to rest the pointer indicates the winner. The banker then pays the winner according to the odds marked on the board. Punters can back more than one horse or the top three winners.<br/><br/>From an Australian sporting perspective, Tatts has some historical interest. The horse names are Australian Champion Thoroughbreds from 1920 to 1921 with horse names synonymous in winning the richest races in Australia, such the Melbourne Cup, Sydney Cup, Caulfield Cup and Rosehill Guineas.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

A fun and exciting strategy game for everyone.<br/>When you and your friends are out in the woods, you are taken by the evil mountain troll and his changes. Now you are stuck down in The troll mountain and have to get out before you are transformed into a troll - or something even worse&hellip;<br/><br/>There are two roads out, but both paths and bridges are in poor condition and full of holes. As a team, you must collect enough different cards so that you can change to your stone and wooden plank tokens to make a way out, and at the same time avoid being stopped by the trolls&hellip;. The exciting escape can begin!<br/><br/>In Trolljakten, each round consists of two parts - first a card part where you pick up new cards and then play as many cards as you want: fix roads, bridges, move trolls or change cards.<br/><br/>When you have finished the card, roll the dice and move one of the team's three game pieces.<br/><br/>The game is both exciting and fun. The more you play the more you discover the different strategies you can use to avoid the trolls, and be the first team to get out of the troll mountain.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

There are no creatures or items allowed in the Tournament of Gods, so player&rsquo;s decks that they build consist entirely of spells and abilities. Duel is realtime, meaning there are no turns and both players receive 1 Mana every 5 seconds to use to draw cards and cast spells and abilities.<br/><br/>Cast a spell by spending the amount of Mana listed as a gold number in the top right of the card and set the projectile sideways on one of the Spell Timers in the center of the field. Set it facing your opponents, as if it was in the air on its way to hit them. Your opponent then has 10 seconds to hit that incoming attack with one of their own, (and if the one that they use is double the ATK or more of the one it collided with it not only kills the weaker one but also continues on towards the enemy&rsquo;s HP.) or use a quick-play ability such as Blink or Reflect.<br/><br/>Players make decks of 50 cards that have no other restrictions whatsoever, just a 50 card max, but they do also have something called a Type Mastery, which is a single type (card color) that they can cast for 1 less Mana and take one less Damage from. There&rsquo;s no limit to how many spells can be used against a single incoming attack, and there&rsquo;s no limit on how many can be played per turn, or how many cards players can draw per turn either, the only limit is how much Mana you have.<br/><br/>",

Flying high and fast won't help you collect any sheep.  Now you have to fly low to grab them and balance your need for speed with your ability to snatch sheep off the ground.  This time the battle isn't to the last dragon standing but to the last sheep found and the winner is the one who has the most sheep at the end.<br/><br/>Sheep Raid is a scenario for Battle Skies, in which the players are dragons attempting to collect the most sheep.

Vaults filled with gold, gems, and other valuables, a great many of which were stolen from the dragons they had driven out of the cave centuries before.  Legends have it that the dragon who lived in the cave fought to defend it until the bitter end.  It is said that in those last minutes he withdrew into himself and all that was left of him was a glowing crystal egg that has become known as a soul gem.  Perhaps out of some strange sense of dragon pride or out of personal greed you have decided to make the dangerous run through the caverns in hopes of grabbing the soul gem.<br/><br/>Dwarven Dive is an intense race through a series of defended caves.

The wooden disk slides along the table surface to push the puck along.

Four clans make up the island: Rock, Water, Forest, and Earth.<br/><br/>In the darkness, quiet battles rage, with Lords, Warriors, Farmers, and even Children playing their part. Loyal as dogs, the towering Kyojuu fight alongside human masters. These mythical creatures protect their clans with unmatched strength. Remembering former times of peace, the Kyojuu are powerless in the presence of Children.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player places their 9 pieces face down within their designated 3x3 home area. Once placed onto the board, these pieces cannot be flipped over again except when attacking, being attacked, or by the special use of an action card. Each turn, players decide whether to roll and advance their pieces, battle another player, &ldquo;pinch&rdquo;, or instead play an action card. When attacking, players reveal the face of one of their pieces that is next to an opposing player's piece. The opponent then reveals their face, and the lower-ranked piece gets removed from the board. The only way to oust a Kyojuu from the board is to &ldquo;pinch&rdquo;, which is when two Children from any clan surround a Kyojuu. This move can be made at any point in the game. Through battles and card play, each player&rsquo;s ultimate goal is to reach the center square of an opponent&rsquo;s 3x3 square home territory. The first player that lands on the center square of an opponent&rsquo;s territory is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

But matching bids cancel each other (butting) in the manner of What the Heck?. So the auction can be won by a player with a low bid.<br/><br/>All bid cards are discarded, until the player exhausts their hand or spends a special token, to refill their hand. By careful choice, a player can know what cards other players have, and manage their own bids successfully.<br/><br/>Players spend cash when they win bids on auction items. Not running out of money too soon is a challenge.<br/><br/>Further, players have two secret cards of winning conditions they want to meet, such as winning different values or combos of items. For example, winning two pairs of items scores 5 bonus points, or a run of items valued 1-3 to get 3 bonus points.<br/><br/>At the end of the auction rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A cat themed card game that is as simple to play like UNO but you can perform fast-paced combos with smooth interactive gameplay.<br/><br/>Each player starts out with 8-10 cards depending on the amount of people playing. The goal is to get rid of your hand as fast as possible but if someone goes out that won't necessarily end the game. Drawing cards is not a punishment. If another player plays a counter active card against the player that went out then that player won't win and that will give someone the opportunity to either stop that player or steal the win from that player.<br/><br/>The unique factor of this game creates simple interaction during any player's turn where the game still flows forward without ever stalling or back tracking which brings an enjoyable experience for everyone.<br/><br/>The possibilities can be endless and unpredictable. Every card was developed to never start out with a bricked hand, which will bring the quality to the game where no one ever feels as if they're at a disadvantage to win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Malaysian-made card game that incorporates strategy and competitive gameplay. Players accumulate trophy cards by winning battles. This addictive and fun game is guaranteed to light up your day. (description at back of box)<br/><br/>The game consists of trophy cards which are worth point values, and duel cards, which have duel points and are used to compete for the trophy cards. At setup, a number of stacks of trophy cards are laid out to match the number of players. Players are dealt 6 duel cards.<br/><br/>During play, players take turns to play duel cards next to the trophy stacks. Duel cards have different strengths and abilities. Once a third duel card is played next to a trophy stack, that stack is evaluated and the player with the highest duel card strength wins the stack. The stack is then replenished.<br/><br/>Duel cards come in different suits, and each type of trophy stack only accepts specific suits.<br/><br/>The game ends when the trophy deck runs out. For a shorter game, play to a fixed number of points instead.<br/><br/>",

When there are three ghost wagons in each tunnel, the game starts. Before the next turn player pushes a new ghost carriage into a tunnel, the player must guess which Disney passenger is in the ghost carriage coming out of that particular tunnel at the other end first. If the player guesses correctly, he gets the passenger piece and is allowed to continue. If the guess is wrong, the piece is put back in the pile of Disney passengers and the next player takes over. So the game continues. Guess which passenger comes out and pushes a new carriage into that tunnel. Lose and win pieces. The game is over when all ghost carriages are empty.

        "description": "This game was made by wholesale store &quot;Makro&quot; (or &quot;Metro&quot; in Germany) for their 25 year anniversary in the Netherlands. You play this trivia game with 2 to 4 teams of each 2 to 4 players in it. Every team put their pawn (a brain) on the start position. The first team to reach the finish wins.<br/><br/>During your turn you will pick the top card from the pile. On each card there are 2 themes, one on each side of the card, and you have 10 seconds to decide which side you want to play.<br/><br/>After choosing the side you want to play, you get 60 seconds to guess the words written on the card which belong to the theme on the top of the card (Dutch writers, capital cities, Makro employer titles, types of cheese). The team to the right of the playing team is the control team, which tallies how many correct answers are given.<br/><br/>The answers are written on the card but have a red coating over them which makes them almost invisible to read, the game also features a pair of sunglasses with red-tainted glasses which can see through the coating and can read the correct answers (this pair of sunglasses is for the control team).<br/><br/>If no correct answer is given in the first 30 seconds, the first answer is given by the control team as a hint, this answer does not count towards the score. After the 60 seconds are over, the playing team moves their pawn as many spots as their score and then the control team becomes the new playing team.<br/><br/>Furthermore, some spots on the board have a special action like &quot;Go back 3 spots&quot;, which goes into effect immediately when a team lands on it, or &quot;if you can at least 5 correct answers next turn, move one extra spot forward&quot; or &quot;Lose a turn&quot;, which goes into effect on their next turn. The board has 48 spaces, including the start and the finish space.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hooks are in the game, but the game has no hook, but works well! How? Well, you are supposed to fish for the most points and this happens with the longest words possible. In the game there are hooks with two ends, each hook carries a letter, the 74 orange hooks the common letters with value 1, the 14 green hooks the already somewhat more difficult letters with value 2 - B, F, G, H and K - and the 12 red hooks provide the problem cases with value 3 - C, J, P, Q, V, X, W and Z. The underlines on some hooks are wildcards for every other letter. The underscores on some hooks are wild cards for every other letter.<br/><br/>In turn, everyone thinks of a word, preferably with the reachable letters, takes the first letter from the pile, holds the hook vertically and fishes the next letter from the pile with the lower hook, until you have formed a valid word. The letters must be strung in the correct order and direction, otherwise the turn ends. If a letter falls from the hook, the turn also ends without points, letters are always put back. As I said, you can only use reachable letters and must not shuffle the pile. If you have a valid word, you keep it. If all letters are used up or no meaningful word is possible anymore, you win with the most points from the collected words.<br/><br/>A creative variation of the word-building games! Of course, it gets harder as more and more letters go out of play, but in return you may be able to form shorter but more valuable words as difficult letters are uncovered. Creativity, vocabulary and a steady hand are required and deliver fun!<br/><br/>",

One circle of each player is placed in the center together with the circle of the other players so that these circles touch each other, so to speak, form a square. The remaining circles are laid out in a circle around this center square with about a hand's width between them; there should be space between the circles and circles of the same color should not be directly adjacent or too close together. The 36 shape cards in six colors - yellow, orange, blue, purple, dark green and red - are laid out in an unordered pile, with each shape once per color.<br/><br/>The active player rolls the dice and takes any shape card of that color and places it on the table so that it touches a circle or another already existing shape card. If there is no matching shape card left in the supply, take any card of that color from the table and place it somewhere else. In this way, each player tries to be the first to connect his own circles with shape cards. The player who succeeds first is the immediate winner.<br/><br/>Cheerful, colorful, simple and an enjoyable, loose practice of spatial imagination and use of space; for example, you can put the fish and the starfish mouth to tip, or put the head of the gobbler in the crook of the starfish or mushroom - so you can overcome long distances, or avoid making it too easy for the other players to connect their own circles faster.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Abner and Hazelponi Hue must stop the Kimriyr before they reach the tombs of Naphal in this game of survival. This is a solo dice game in which victory is achieved by rolling dice to equal an enemies K.O. Points.<br/><br/>Getting past 12 enemies,(fewer for easier difficulty) will ensure victory. This is achieved with the aid of abilities and traits to provide re-rolls. The game includes eye catching dice and plastic flame token for tracking.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, a hand card is played and a new card drawn. With each card played, the enemy movement markers moves a step. When the marker is moved off the last mark, the enemy is encountered. All six dice are rolled in an encounter in an attempt to match the K.O. Value. The game ends when the player loses all capacity points or finished the last encounter with at least one capacity point remaining.<br/><br/>Changes from the 2015 edition include: <br/>Tthe 16 custom candle dice concept in the 2015 version is removed. The new version has six standard dice and uses three tracking cards.<br/><br/>Movement is no longer tracked by cards, rather tracked with a token.<br/><br/>A main character had 1 ability in the 2015 version while the new version has 8 to purchase and use by playing cards.<br/><br/>",

What neither of them know: They contracted the new NOSO virus (STILL SO a virus) while on vacation! Only after three days of incubation do they feel sick and stay at home. But how many residents have the two infected meanwhile unnoticed?<br/>Can a major virus outbreak still be prevented?<br/><br/>Virusalarm in Bleibhausen is a free game for children and adolescents from the age of 12 that was developed with scientists from IST Austria and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Biology. By reenacting the spread of a fictional virus in a city, players will explore and understand what countermeasures can take to contain viruses. In the Home Edition for the home, the players slip into the role of scientists ( game variants &ldquo;simulation&rdquo; and &ldquo;vaccination &rdquo;), or into the role of politicians who have to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of restrictions on public life ( game variant &ldquo;Challenge &rdquo; ).<br/><br/>Chips symbolize people, yellow ones are sick, white ones are still healthy. They are distributed in different buildings on a game board that depicts the fictional city of Bleibhausen. If there are white chips with yellow ones in a building, e.g. the restaurant, they become infected and turn yellow.<br/><br/>Players try to minimise the spread and earn points depending on how well they control the disease.  The player/team with the most points, wins.<br/><br/>Es ist ein sch&ouml;ner Fr&uuml;hlingstag, als im 100-Einwohner St&auml;dtchen Bleibhausen zwei Leute vom Skiurlaub zur&uuml;ckkommen. Was die beiden nicht wissen: Sie haben sich im Urlaub mit dem neuen NOSO-Virus (NOch SO ein Virus) angesteckt! Erst nach drei Tagen Inkubationszeit f&uuml;hlen sie sich krank und bleiben zuhause. Aber wie viele Einwohner_innen haben die beiden inzwischen schon unbemerkt angesteckt?<br/>Ist ein gro&szlig;er Virenausbruch noch zu verhindern?<br/><br/>",

So, that's why we've come up with 130 ridiculous scenarios that will embarrass everyone one card a time and you'll find yourself belly laughing on the ground not caring that someone just pee'd there.<br/><br/>The game goes a little something like this:<br/><br/>Person A picks up from the deck and reads the card aloud to everyone &quot;What are the Odds?&quot; Person B (The person to their right aka righty) chooses the odds to make this between. This cannot be any higher than 10 or any lower than 2. The closer to 10, the less chance of the odds being chosen. The closer to 2, the more change of the odds being chosen because yeah...it's a one in two chance.<br/><br/>Person A &amp; B think of a number between those odds set by Person B.  Everyone counts 3,2,1....then at the same time Person A &amp; Person B say the number they were thinking between those odds given.<br/><br/>If they say the same number, then Person B must do the task for the points or risk loosing points. If they don't say the same number, then it moves on to Person B pulling a card and reading it to Person C. (or back to Person A if you are playing with 2 people)<br/><br/>The name of the game is to get the most points and win. You decide on how many points that is as a group before starting.<br/><br/>",

To make such a flight you have to negotiate the price with other CEOs, whoever gives the most rolls the dice.<br/><br/>Before game starts players draw a card with their main airport, a  'special ability' card and get one aircraft. Players can upgrade their aircraft, take a loan, and bids on flying to a destination. The player who wins the auction rolls the dice to see if they've made a profit. The first player to collect a billion Euro wins the game.<br/><br/>How much and whether you earn on the connection made depends on several factors, such as the economy of your plane, what airport is your home base, random events such as damaged landing gear and especially on how many passengers will use your line! By managing risk well, wisely investing in modernizing your machines or rejecting unprofitable connections, you will develop your airline and achieve success in this hellishly difficult aviation business!<br/><br/>The expanded edition contains : +10 random event cards  +2 starting airports cards (this means 7 players can play the game), +2 special ability cards (as above), +20 destination airports (60 vs 40, longer game), aircraft service fee (which you have to pay every round, depends on aircraft type), loans<br/><br/><br/>W grze Lotniczy Biznes, stajemy się prezesem nowej linii lotniczej, jest to niezwykle hermetyczny rynek i ciężko Nam &quot;wejść na salony&quot;, zwłaszcza, że razem z nami otwierają się inne linie lotnicze, a ich prezesami zostają Nasi znajomi!Światowe lotniska są coraz bardziej zatłoczone i coraz popularniejszy jest handel slotami na lotniskach, im popularniejsze lotnisko, tym więcej trzeba za taki slot zapłacić, jednak jest to okazja dla linii, ponieważ mogą oni podnieść cenę biletu oraz liczyć na większy zarobek! Najdroższą taką transakcją w historii, był zakup połączenia na Heathrow, American Airlines zapłaciło aż 60 milion&oacute;w dolar&oacute;w linii SAS, za ich miejsce!<br/><br/>Dla naszych linii co rundę otwiera się możliwość wykonania jednego połączenia, na kt&oacute;rym możecie albo zarobić albo stracić, w przypadku gdy mało pasażer&oacute;w skorzysta z Waszej linii! Aby wykonać taki lot musicie negocjować z innymi prezesami cenę, kto da najwięcej, rzuca kostką.<br/><br/>To ile i czy zarobicie na wykonanym połączeniu zależy od kilku czynnik&oacute;w, takich jak ekonomiczność Waszego samolotu, to jakie lotnisko jest Waszym portem macierzystym, zdarzeń losowych takich jak uszkodzone podwozie! A zwłaszcza od tego, ilu pasażer&oacute;w skorzysta z Waszej linii!<br/><br/>Dobrze zarządzając ryzykiem, mądrze inwestując w modernizacje swojej maszyny czy odrzucając nierentowne połączenia rozwiniecie swoją linie i osiągniecie sukces na tym piekielnie trudnym lotniczym biznesie!<br/><br/>Grę wygrywa gracz, kt&oacute;ry jako pierwszy zgromadzi miliard Euro.<br/><br/>",

You give a rating to wines from various countries, while investing in wineries to monopolize the market.<br/><br/>This game uses 4 investment tokens per player and 16 cards. On the table, there is a space to hold 16 cards in 4 x 4 square grid, and each row and column represents reputation of a winery in which players may invest. Each turn, you have two options: you may place a rating card, which ranges from -3 to +5, in the square grid, affecting two wineries; or you may place two investment tokens on any wineries.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, the investor on each winery takes the reputation score on that winery. After the third round, the investor calculates their total score.<br/><br/>Although the cards have Japanese text, you can play Wine Rating ignoring the text. There are two types of cards: winery cards and rating cards. Winery cards are written in English and Japanese, and all Japanese text on the Rating cards are just flavor.

Both fairies don't want to let on that they are apprentice, and so do not talk as they work. The more flowers they can make bloom, they better they succeed.<br/><br/>The game title Sana is a contraction Sakura Narabu, meaning Line Up Blossoms. The kanji 儷 (Narabu) is remarkably obscure. Hence the publisher has added the more simple hiragana さな to help readers as a furigana (pronunciation indicator).<br/><br/>The board shows ten open spaces for Sakura, each space being for five petals. Players will build up complete flowers on the spaces to win.<br/><br/>Each player has a number of petal pieces, showing 1 to 4 petals. They secretly take a petal in hand and show them together, without discussing what they are choosing.<br/><br/>If they have chosen different pieces, then they each place their chosen petals on the board. But an existing piece must be taken off the board to a storage area.<br/><br/>If they have chosen the same pieces to play (butting), again they place their pieces, but may now bring a piece from the storage area onto the board.<br/><br/>When places their pieces, the players can talk so to get optimal placement. But they cannot discuss what pieces they have left, not what to choose next turn.<br/><br/>There are also some placement conditions depending upon the number of petals. For example, a 3 petal piece can only go to an empty space.<br/><br/>Once a flower is complete, it cannot be changed. Pieces that cannot be placed are returned to hand.<br/><br/>The game ends in certain ways:<br/>When a player runs out of pieces.<br/>When all ten flowers are complete.<br/>When the storage area has five pieces.<br/><br/>Then the players see how many flowers they have completed and praise or chastise themselves accordingly.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Each player blindly chooses 5 tiles and try to see if they match any of the characters you have on your board. If so you can keep them, if not you return them face up, so everyone can see which characters is on that tile. Luckily there are a few wild cards among the pile which you can use to fill in a missing character on your board.<br/><br/>If you want to try to make it a bit harder, you can play level 2. You flip over your board and instead of the preprinted characters you get 8 empty circles on your board.

Fighting provide experience, either physical or psychic, and when a character has three experience of a type they must turn them in for increases in traits.<br/><br/>There are a number of fixed locations on the board with special rules in a separate adventure booklet, and in some cases special decks of encounter cards. There are also minor locations which have cards in the standard decks and are placed on the board once found.<br/><br/>There are rules for encumbrance, player vs. player combat, healing, etc. Players may band together as a group. Some activities are regulated by alignment, of which there are two kinds: good vs. evil and imperial vs. rebel. For example, good characters can't attack without provocation.<br/><br/>There are several ways to win the game, all dependent on alignment. For example, a good character can achieve a spiritual victory by entering the Nether Realm and defeating the Prince of Darkness, while a rebel character can achieve a political victory by finding the king in his keep and defeating him. Some ways require finding the five rings forming the Hand of Fate, but if a character wears all of them at once they may become bewitched by them, in which case they get special powers but then can only win by killing all the other characters. The rules suggest that for a shorter game a time limit is set and then if no one has achieved a victory condition, a scoring rubric is provided.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "12星座のガールズギターリフダービー (The 12 Zodiac Signs Girls Guitar Riff Derby) is a card game from Japan. The publisher says &quot;A music competition for primary school children, with no psychological warfare. Let's get into the rock swamp!<br/><br/>The game is a tournament between 8 high school girls chosen from the 12 signs of the Zodiac. You might think that this is a beauty contest or a story about a prince who wants to become a princess, but it's not. It's a battle of rock guitar riffs.<br/><br/>The game is short and minimalistic, so all but the finals are decided in a &quot;rock-paper-scissors&quot; kind of way, with lots of draws. Until the final, you may not reveal which girl you are favouring.<br/><br/>In the final, you will have to play the Do-Re-Mi... on the card as if it were a guitar riff battle. （The final is a guitar riff competition. (The author has arranged the music, but there is no stave, so you will have to make corrections and add any missing notes.)<br/><br/>The game is very light and quick to play. Recommended for primary schools children. You can also play &quot;Horoscope Detective Michika&quot; using the same 16 cards to guess your opponent's 12 signs of the zodiac.<br/><br/>心理戦とか無い(精神年齢)小学生向き音楽系勝ち抜き戦。ロック沼にはめよう<br/><br/>この「12星座のガールズギターリフダービー」も12星座から選ばれた８人の少女によるトーナメント戦です。<br/>少女たちによる対戦なので美人コンテストや王子様のプリンセス目指す話でしょと思われるかもしれませんが違います。ロックのギターリフを競う戦いとなります。<br/>短時間でゲームが終わるミニマムゲームのため決勝以外は「引き分け多めのジャンケン」のような方法で勝負が決まります。決勝までどの少女を推してるか伏せても構いません。<br/>決勝ではカードに記しているドレミ&hellip;をギターリフ合戦を繰り広げるように競います。（作者が編曲していますが五線譜がないので補正したり足りない音があれば加えたりしなければなりません⁈ヒントはその少女がリスペクトしているミュージシャンです）。<br/>とても軽くスカッとプレイするゲームです。精神年齢小学生におススメです。<br/>［同じカード16枚使って、相手の12星座を当てる「星占い探偵ミチカ」もプレイできます］<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",

Whenever a call came in, he grabbed his bag and rushed to the patient's bedside. Very often, however, he found that in his haste, he had brought the wrong cure. But did that stop him? No, he tried anyway, and, funny as it may seem, his patients would always get well.&quot;<br/><br/>Players each choose a color of playing piece, and place them on Doctor Quack's house in the center of the playing board, to start. Each player draws one Cure Card. Players spin to see who goes first.<br/><br/>In order to reach the different cases, players take turns spinning and moving their playing piece along a path of their choice. When they land on a case space, they can check to see if they have the matching Cure Card for that case. If they don't, they can either keep moving on subsequent turns to try to find and reach the matching case, or they can make their way back to Dr. Quack's house to pick up another cure. The other way to get an additional Cure Card is to spin a 6, 9, or 10 - then you can choose to take a card instead of moving that turn.<br/><br/>Once a player makes a cure match, they collect that case card, which indicates a number of points on it. When all cases have been cured, the player with the most total points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Card game IQ Ring: No. 3 is an educational question-and-answer game. The game consists of a set of 90 cards with questions, 14 special cards to track the score, 4 player figures, 6 surprise cards and an answer book. Each question card contains 3 questions of different difficulty. The first question is worth 1 point, the second 2 points and the third 3 points.<br/>The game progresses in a clockwise direction. First, the question and surprise cards are shuffled into one deck. The player on the left then draws the card. If it is a question card - the player chooses one of the 3 questions and tries to answer it. If the answer is correct, the player goes as far as the question was worth. If incorrect, stay standing or go back if indicated on a special card. If the surprise card is pulled out, what is written on it is executed. The winner is the one who first scores 14 points.<br/>This game can be expanded with IQ Ring: No. 1 and IQ Ring: No. 2 cards.<br/><br/>Kortelių žaidimas &quot;IQ ringas: Nr. 3&quot; &ndash; tai lavinamasis edukacinis klausimų ir atsakymų žaidimas.

Kiekvienoje klausimų kortelėje yra po 3 skirtingo sudėtingumo klausimus. Pirmas klausimas vertas 1 ta&scaron;ko, antras &ndash; 2, trečias &ndash; 3 ta&scaron;kų.<br/>Žaidimo eiga vyksta laikrodžio rodyklės kryptimi. Pirmiausia yra sumai&scaron;omos klausimų ir netikėtumo kortelės į vieną kaladę. Tuomet kairėje esantis žaidėjas traukia kortelę. Jei tai klausimų kortelė - žaidžiantysis pasirenka vieną i&scaron; 3 klausimų ir bando į jį atsakyti. Jei atsakymas teisingas, žaidėjas paeina tiek, kiek vertas buvo klausimas. Jei neteisingas, lieka stovėti vietoje arba eina atgal jei taip yra nurodyta specialioje kortelėje. Jei yra i&scaron;traukiama netikėtumo kortelė, vykdoma tai, kas joje para&scaron;yta. Laimi tas, kuris greičiausiai surenka 14 ta&scaron;kų.<br/>&Scaron;į žaidimą galima praplėsti su &quot;IQ ringas: Nr. 1&quot; ir &quot;IQ ringas: Nr. 2&quot; kortomis.<br/><br/>",

He rolls the dice and advances his piece by the die roll number of points, except that he rolls on die number 6, see DICE ROLLING - special rolls at the end of the rules.<br/><br/>A player leaves the DEPO station in two in two arbitrary directions until the final  stations in one direction - 11 Nadrazi;  in the other direction - 1 Bielska Street.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who completes both challenges first - namely, checking off the following tasks in sequence all 11 tram stops and collects 6 bonus cards (M).

Anyone who dares to challenge him to remove the gems ends up wishing they hadn't tried.<br/><br/>But, now, a group of Heroes are ready to enter and appropriate his priceless treasure. So much so that, blinded by greed, all champions will do whatever it takes to get the best cut. Get the highest number of victory points with the Arkonites collected and stored in the coffers of your kingdom. Each color of Arkonite has a different value. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>During each round of Raju, two Arkonites are drawn from Raju's cave (from his cloth bag) and the die is rolled to see if the night and day champion cards are empowered or if, on the contrary, there is an eclipse and all champions develop your skills during this round.<br/><br/>Each opponent plays a Master card (secretly or not, depending on the previous roll of the die) in their own play area. Whoever has the highest card number wins the round and takes the Raju treasure drawn at the beginning of the round.<br/><br/>This mechanic is repeated over 9 rounds where, depending on how you have played your cards taking into account what you think others are going to play, you will or will not be the winner.<br/><br/>Depending on the game mode, up to 3 games can be chained together without revealing the loot achieved. Which makes it very interesting due to the great variety of Arkonites included in the game and of different value.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is intended to play with the idea that not all heroes are heroic. The designer's blurb is 勇者だからってまじめにまおう倒しにいくと思ってますか？ (Yūshadakara tte majime ni maou taoshi ni iku to omottemasu ka?) (Are you expecting me to defeat the demon lord just because I&rsquo;m a hero?) or (Do you seriously think you are going to defeat the Devil King just because you are brave?), emphasising the counter-play tone of the game.<br/><br/>Players are trying to reach a central castle and defeat the Demon King (Maou 魔王 is a generic fantasy term for the/a devil king or demon lord). They can be aided in their quest by Jewel Fairies. There are six player characters drawn from who have different weapons, but each character also has some trouble. The winner is not the player who reaches Maou first, but second, and helps defeat Maou.<br/><br/>As the players progress along the path, they play mini-games which serve as training for the main game. Each player is trying to move themselves forward, but keep moving other players forward too, so that they get to arrive second after another player.<br/><br/>The game has various decks of adventure stories, so there is variety as you play it over again.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The lantern cards and solution cards are distributed to all players with their backs facing up. A face-down pile is formed from the event cards and luck cards. One card is drawn from this pile at a time. Whoever draws a lucky card may turn over a lantern card, which now shows the lantern light. If an event card is drawn, you need the matching solution card to reveal a lantern. You point to one of the face-down solution cards, this is temporarily turned over. In the case of 2 events (wind and rain), even a lantern that is already lit is extinguished if you do not find the matching solution card. If the players manage to light all the lanterns, they win the game, otherwise they lose together.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Have at You! is a quick-playing card game about hand-to-hand combat during the 16th to 18th Centuries, as inspired by films such as the Errol Flynn classics of the 1940s as well as the more recent Pirates of the Carribean series. Each player takes the role of fighters who can get their hands on any weapons available to defeat the enemy. Each fighter has a fixed number of physical damage points that, once expended, result in his or her death.<br/><br/>In the base set, combat takes place aboard a ship, with the kind of weaponry available that one might expect: Daggers, Cutlasses, Belaying Pins, Pikes, Pistols, Grappling Hooks, and the occasional Bottle of Rum. Future expansions will explore other locations, such as Taverns and Encampments.<br/><br/>Play follows a basic rock-paper-scissors mechanic of taking actions when available and trying to avoid their cancellation through the opponent's play of reaction cards. But be careful! Every action causes fatigue, with nastier weapons causing more of it. As fighters get tired, fatigue turns to physical damage, so a player must balance the health of their own fighter while trying to take down the enemy.<br/><br/>There are several ways to play the game. At the most basic is a &quot;duel&quot; where a player wins once his or her opponent goes down. &quot;Brawls&quot; can also be played, where the death of an opponent &quot;spawns&quot; a new enemy, so victory is dependent upon the number of fighters eliminated on both sides. This base set also supports up to four players, so teams can fight against each other, while assisting teammates.<br/><br/>The base set includes over 140 &quot;mini-cards&quot; that can be self-printed along with the other tracks necessary to play. There is also an option to have the mini-cards professionally published at a reasonable cost. All of the components were designed to fit within a &quot;video tape box.&quot;<br/><br/>NOTE: The &quot;Card(s)&quot; option does not include the rules and charts needed for play.

The playing board is slightly elevated at one end to create a slope. The path mostly contains a series small holes for the marble to sit, but every so often on the path is a much larger hole where if a player lands directly on the large hole by the dice roll then the wooden marble falls through and rolls down the slope to the start and the player must begin again.<br/><br/>A player may &quot;Butt&quot; an opponent forward if he directly lands on that player. First player to reach Paddy McGinty's Goat's right eye is deemed the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game starts with players designing the Town by choosing from the 12 available districts, ranging from forest to the central business district. Changing the set up of the Town means that the game has more variability over time as districts advantage different candidates. Players are also assigned purple 'values' cards, which they share with the players next to them. This means you have things in common but, in a 4 player game, have nothing in common with the person sitting across from you! Values are important: your candidates perform better if they have the same values and your projects give you more legacy points if they also align with your values.<br/><br/>Once the Town is established and the districts chosen, players select cards (their candidates and inventory) and begin building up their arsenal for the upcoming elections. Be sure to select good candidates! They come with one or more Persuasive (P), Strategic (S) or Ruthless (R) skills which determines the number and type of actions they can make as candidates and later on as councillors.<br/><br/>Each district is up for election and players spend resources trying to ensure their candidate comes out as the winner. Players adopt the persona of their candidate and give a short 'campaign speech' to the table, outlining why they deserve your vote. The player with the &quot;best speech&quot; wins additional support which increases their odds of being elected. Support is also increased by the candidate's popularity in that district and any other cards you burn to give you a competitive edge. Be careful: the more you burn now, the less you can do once you're in Town Hall! Each candidate elected is worth legacy points, which decide the game.<br/><br/>Winning candidates become councillors who can complete project in their term of office if they have the necessary skills (P, S or R). Complete a project and get more legacy points. Diversity is key: players are rewarded bonus points for a complete PSR set of 3. At the end of 3 rounds the player with the highest number of legacy points is the winner! For experienced players, there is the option to include an add-on mode where the Mayor of the day tries to persuade players to support their proposal.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

If its colour matches that shown on the die, the peg is retained, the player scores a point, and has another turn (roll, draw). This continues until the peg colour does not match the die roll, in which case the peg is replaced in the same position on the board, and play passes to the next player.

You thus begin your travels from your hometown of Paris to Santiago and finally return home the way whence you came.<br/><br/>The game is begun by shuffling the number cards (the companion cards) and laying them out between Paris and Santiago. When your turn comes, advance your pilgrim card as much as you like and earn a travel companion card. There is no restriction on the distance you can travel towards the card you desire, but there is no turning back once you advance your pilgrim.<br/><br/>How do you turn your journey into the best pilgrimage? By collecting travel companions (number cards)! You must choose number cards very carefully. In order to score the most by the cards you collect, you must collect as many of the same cards as possible, or collect various kind of cards. For example, the number 1 card allows you to score with just one card, but you must collect a large amount of number 9 cards (and/or a variety of cards) in order to score with them!  In this game, you win by scoring more points than other pilgrims in a total of two rounds: a journey from Paris to Santiago and another one from Santiago to Paris.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Maybe the real treasure was the friends we made along the way&rdquo;.<br/><br/>",

All that matters is that you are the last one standing.<br/><br/>Begin by choosing who goes first, preferably the least liked of your friends, who smells the worst, has the loudest burp or is the mostly to die first (in the game, don't be so morbid). The chosen player with then shuffle the deck and deal every player 5 cards and 5 Heart Tokens. The player to the left of the dealer will then begin the game with the first play action as the Active Player.<br/><br/>Once a player loses all 5 Heart Tokens, they are out. So, make sure to maintain your defenses since any defenses that are down, leave your Heart Tokens completely exposed.<br/><br/>On the Active Players turn, they can play 1 Hand Grenade card to attack with and 1 Horseshoe card to build up their defenses. No more than 3 Horseshoe cards can be in play for each player. After they have completed their two actions, they must draw a card to end their turn so that the Active Player status transfers to the next player on the left.<br/><br/>On the Inactive Players turn, they can play Short Fuse cards in response to any action performed by the Active Player or other Inactive Players, shifting the tides to favor themselves or others. But, they must be careful, since the Active Player can play Short Fuses in response to others.<br/><br/>In the end, only one shall remain. You may refer to yourself as the victor, but everyone else may refer to you as a frag-faced-fuck. So, pull the pin, count to 3 and have some explosive fun with Horseshoes &amp; Hand Grenades.<br/><br/>",

Named &quot;Coco&quot; by the locals, Coco will climb up the Rockport International to evade his attackers. As he climbs up the tower, military planes release a torrent of gunfire to attempt to stop Coco's rampage. Using a traditional deck of card, you will assume the role of Coco. Two columns of cards will create your tower. Starting from the bottom of the tower, you will manipulate cards to create an ascending order of cards all the way to the top of the tower. Using memory, planning and a little bit of luck, if you make it to the top of the tower, you win!<br/><br/>But watch out! The higher up you go, the more likely that military planes will successfully hit you. If you are hit three times, before making it to the top of the tower, you lose!<br/><br/>Once you are comfortable with the game, you can increase the difficulty with the Night Rampage variant. This requires a great deal of memorization. There is also an Extended variant with the addition of a two card spire on top of the building. This will challenge you with a thinner draw deck and a more intense plane attack.<br/><br/>Can you safely guide Coco to the top of the tower?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Knowtable is a unique card game that is 100 percent about connection between its players.  Players get to share their stories and show off what they have noticed about the other players in the game.  Players learn about one another and learn what other people have noticed about them.  It is the rare kind of game where no one is sad when they &ldquo;lose&rdquo; because the process of the game is so fun and affirming.<br/><br/>I developed Knowtable over many years with my daughters.  I am a single mother who values my connection with my daughters above all else.  We invented this game and we played it often because it always made us laugh and feel closer to one another.<br/><br/>It is best for 3-8 players ages 10 and up, although it can be modified for younger players.  The premise is that a &ldquo;category card&rdquo; is pulled by a judge and the players have ten seconds to think of something that falls within that category that will *most appeal* to the judge.  At 10 seconds the judge counts down, &ldquo;3-2-1&rdquo; and the guessers shout out their guess. For example, the category is &ldquo;car.&rdquo;  The guessers might respond: &ldquo;a mercedes,&rdquo; &ldquo;the 1976 Rabbit that you got on your 16th birthday,&rdquo; &ldquo;a bike because cars are bad for the planet.&rdquo; Anything goes so long as it will appeal to the judge.<br/><br/>This alone sponsors conversation.  Players like to explain their answer and the judge likes to explain why he or she picks the answer that most appeals to him or her.  The winning guesser gets the point and becomes the next judge.  In the case of a tie where more than one player asserts the same &ldquo;winning&rdquo; guess, &ldquo;break cards&rdquo; are pulled. The break cards contain descriptions such as &ldquo;biggest hands,&rdquo; &ldquo;youngest,&rdquo; &ldquo;shortest&rdquo;, &ldquo;most recently ate a piece of fruit,&rdquo; etc.  The player that best fits the description wins the tie break, gets a point and becomes the next judge.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The animals have a limited time to evacuate before each sanctuary is destroyed. Destinarc is the only safe place and they must evacuate there to escape the danger and help save other animals - their own kind or all kinds.<br/><br/>You can play this game in two modes: competitive and co-operative. In competitive mode, players play for themselves and the winner is the player who saves the most animals of one type. In co-operative mode, everyone works together and wins when all animals are safely evacuated.<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll a die and move one of the animals the same number of spaces or to an unoccupied stone with the same number. Every two turns or so, a Warning card is pulled to show which board will disappear. You must move the animals off that board quickly before the board is removed along with everything on it. Be careful! The board you just landed on may go next! Or there may be no escape route left!<br/><br/>In those dire situations, there is always hope when the animals work together to save one another.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

A combat-centric member of the infamous Bleeding Moon, he excells in death, stealth and being prepared to deal with any situation. Being able to react fluidly counts massively when on missions, which makes this Shadows Crow the terrifying foe he is. His weapon of choice is the Kama: a short, sickle-like weapon that can slice and punch through the stoutest of armour. He loves it so much that he fights with one in each hand, and when in motion, they are a wall of slicing steel. He hides his identity behind a fearsome mask that stupefies his enemies for a second or two when they see it. They often realise - correctly - that this will be the last thing they see on this earth, and the hesitation is all he needs to strike first.<br/><br/>Shinyuki is a combat model that will excel at putting Damage and Bleed Markers on your enemy models. The Slice Ki Feat is expensive, but the damage can be worth it as it often turns a hit into a kill with a whopping Bleed 3 Marker. The ability to get Melee Boost 2 can help if locked in a protracted combat as you can get that higher Melee Pool every turn. The best use of this model may be to finish off a wounded enemy and use the Escape Ki Feat to reposition for Camouflage and Distance from the enemy. This moderate rice cost melee toolbox opens a lot of options for Bleeding Moon players.<br/><br/>Blister contains one miniature, 30mm base and full colour profile card.<br/><br/>",

It included elements of Auto Race and Monopoly and added complications such as planets moving in their orbits. The game took an enormous amount of time to play: 8 or 12 hours or even more.<br/><br/>According to Widner: The reason it took so long is that it was a combination of a standard &lsquo;race&rsquo; game and Monopoly. One had to get to a planet and bring back a cargo in order to finance a trip to the next distant planet where a still more valuable cargo would be obtained, etc., out to Pluto, which harbored &lsquo;Immortality Dust,&rsquo; the game winner. The novel aspect was that the planets moved, making it difficult to land on one, plus such hazards as the &lsquo;negasphere&rsquo; (from E. E. Smith epics -- now known as a black hole) and pirates, to say nothing of falling into the sun, getting hit with space junk, etc.<br/><br/>Years later, Bill Evans, Bob Pavlat, C. Stewart Metchette, and Ted White changed the rules enough to make it possible to play the game in an evening. It still didn't catch on.<br/><br/>",

Collect colorful frogs by drafting them over three short acts and build up your circus to be the best in the world.<br/><br/>Each act, your hand size will decrease, building tension throughout the game.  Your stage can only be 3x3 stacks and each stack can only have 3 cards, but once you place the third card on a stack, it cannot be altered for the rest of the game.  But building stacks, while encouraged, is also risky.  If you don't fill all 9 spaces of your stage, you'll lose points for each unfilled space.<br/><br/>Most frogs score points at the end of the game but some frogs' abilities trigger immediately such as the pink frog that helps you recruit extra frogs or the green frog that allows you move frogs between stages.  These two frogs are powerful and help you ruin your opponent's plans.<br/><br/>For more addictive replayability, dual frogs are thrown into the mix to give more variety and open up entertaining combos such as a yellow frog being worth up to 15 points or adding extra points to each blue frog.  With each game lasting around 15 minutes, Stacking Frogs is an entertaining, simple and strategic drafting game for all ages.  If you play it once, you'll definitely want to play it again!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

After one round, the game is played again with swapped roles.<br/>Both players move their figures by throwing the dice over a start-finish course. At the beginning of the game, the little bird has ducats, which must be paid out to the hunter every now and then. If the ducats run out, the bird must draw and fulfil task cards. These tasks are suitable for impressing shy teenagers from the 1970s. Example: &quot;Dance with me.&quot; Whoever has the largest sum of ducats and task cards after both rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

You will try to make your way over a recent flow field of smooth, glassy pāhoehoe lava without hurting yourself. If you can make it to Highway 130, then maybe you&rsquo;ll get picked up and taken to a shelter in the nearby town of Pahoa.<br/><br/>DETAILS: You roll dice to determine the journey the cat will take across lava. Along the way, you draft abilities by playing &quot;akamai&quot; cards. These allow you to change the path of your journeys, to avoid losing life points or whiskers. After six rounds, your score (whiskers multiplied by life points) reflects how well you survived the overall journey.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This mini expansion has been designed by Carcassonne.cat to celebrate the first European (Online) Team Championship. In doing so, we have encapsulated elements of the global Covid-19 pandemic such as the recommendation to use a protective mask to minimize the spread of the virus, and the need for self-isolation among those who may have been in contact with it.<br/>Thus, the meeple with stars between the two roads depicted on the tile symbolizes the geographical context of the championship and the exceptional situation in Europe, and throughout the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>The Roads of Europe tile should be mixed in with the other tiles as usual<br/><br/>How to use the tile<br/><br/>Following the basic rules for laying tiles, proceed as normal according to the following cases.<br/><br/>In 2-player games, promote a more competitive use<br/><br/>When a player draws this tile and places it such that it extends a road (or roads), any meeple(s) occupying these roads must immediately be removed from them without scoring. These meeples have been in contact with the virus and must go home to self-isolate! The active player must then place each removed meeple into separate incomplete and unoccupied cities of his choice, somewhere on the landscape. Meeples may not be moved into any city that is already occupied.<br/>If there are not enough unoccupied cities available to accommodate all removed meeples separately, the active player chooses which meeples to place and which to return to their owner. After all removed meeples have either been moved to cities or returned to their owners, the active player is granted a bonus turn and must draw a new tile and place it according to the usual rules.<br/>If the tile is placed on an unclaimed road (i.e. one without a meeple), it may not be claimed by the active player and no bonus turn is given.<br/>The road may be extended on subsequent turns, but may not be claimed until such time that it is completed. The player that completes the road may choose to claim and score it, as per the usual rules, as long as they have at least one meeple in their supply.<br/><br/>With 3 or more players, promote a more playful and fun use -<br/><br/>The rules for games with more than two players follow the same rules as outlined above for games with two players, but with one exception: when the road is closed, all players who have not closed the road will lose as many points as there are tiles on the road.<br/><br/>Special cases<br/><br/><br/>     While meeples may never be placed as thieves on any of the road segments on the special tile, the fields are safe from the virus and may be claimed according to the usual rules by a meeple as a farmer.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     There may be a situation where the placement of the special tile automatically closes a road. In that case, if there are meeples on it, they would return to their owners and the player who placed the tile would not be able to claim the road and the other players would not lose points either.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     In the case of playing with expansions, all the tiles with special effects would disappear as part of the road expansion before closing. In any case, the tokens could still be used as normal tokens. Example: The mini tunnel expansion contributes to the expansion of the road without adding any special effects, but the princess and the dragon or inns and cathedrals contain symbols that are canceled when they are part of the road.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beat to Quarters, Vol II (Serpents of the Seas) is an official expansion to Serpents of the Seas by GMT Games, LLC and requires a copy of that game to play.<br/><br/>One of the most common criticisms of the Flying Colors system is the clutter of status markers on the map and that they may detract from game play. This concern can be minimized somewhat by using status sheets and a handy pencil to keep track of things on paper. This, however, adds a separate record-keeping aspect that the design of the game goes out of its way to avoid.<br/><br/>Beat to Quarters provides the ultimate way by which to keep track of the status of individual ships through the use of individual tracking cards that are kept conveniently near the map and that are laid out to conveniently hold a variety of status markers such as Broadsides Fired, Sail State, Rigging Damage, and Hull Damage. The cards are designed to be printed at a standard 3.5 by 2.5 inch size so that they can be slipped into card protectors for extended usage.<br/><br/>Individual tracking cards are included for all 255 individually named ships included with Serpents of the Seas. But that&rsquo;s not all!<br/><br/>As a bonus, Beat to Quarters also includes the print-and-play components for an entirely new way to play Serpents of the Seas. Drawing from games such as Naval War, Modern Naval Battles, and (in particular) Enemy in Sight, Beat to Quarters can be played with just the ship tracking cards, a special set of markers and 8.5 x 11 inch tracking board, and the status markers from Serpents of the Seas. The ship cards are organized into squadrons that maneuver and fire against the opposing fleet within a relatively small playing area. With Beat to Quarters, you can play the huge battles without the space requirements for several game maps.<br/><br/>NOTE: This volume of Beat to Quarters only includes marker sheets for the British, French, and American fleets. There are insufficient Spanish, Venetian, and East India Company ships to form a fleet, but these ships can be included in the fleets of the other nationalities as desired or added to the cards from the first volume of Beat to Quarters.<br/><br/>With Beat to Quarters, you can either enhance or completely change your enjoyment of Serpents of the Seas!<br/>Card play modifications to Flying Colors.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Zeus has granted you the ability to wield his Thunderbolts in a Tournament of the gods. You&rsquo;ll capture mythological creatures as you build an army to command in an epic contest for fame, fortune and most of all, bragging rights in Mt. Olympus. In this mystically veiled bidding and battling game, the god that scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>This is a fun, fast paced action game that is played in three distinct phases, the capture, command and scoring phases. As part of the game, there is a hidden god role card that each player has assumed. Only the gods know when you'll reveal your god identity and how your divine power will be used to enhance your play and stifle others.<br/><br/>In the capture phase, using a bidding style mechanic, you&rsquo;ll use your limited supply of Thunderbolt tokens to capture mythological creatures from around the table. Gathering information is a key element of this phase because each player will only be allowed to see the creature&rsquo;s strengths on other players stands. Their own creature card will be on a stand facing away from them and therefore unknown. So, if you surrender, you&rsquo;ll need to take the lowest strength creature you can see.<br/><br/>After the capture phase, each player will then command their army of mythological creatures one at a time to battle for treasures! This phase is an epic competition for various treasures (gold, armor, valor, temples and worshippers) that only interest the gods. Treasure cards have different point values that range between 1 - 10 and various symbols that are part of your set collections and end game scoring. But be aware that worshippers, the 9 and 10 point value treasure cards, don't have any symbols while the golden Apple, the 1 and 2 point value treasure cards, have a wild symbol that can be used in any one of your set collections.<br/><br/>After all the battling and treasure collecting is done, it&rsquo;s time to move into the scoring phase and tally up your scores. Unused thunderbolts, treasure cards, set collections (combination of creatures and treasure cards) and any god card bonuses all count towards your grand total. The player, or Olympian god with the most points wins and gets bragging rights in Olympus... for now.<br/><br/>",

In Carcassonne, the upper town (city) remains untouched, but the lower town disappears in flames. In Narbonne, the suburbs, devoid of defences, were destroyed. Retracing his steps, &Eacute;douard took the Chemin de Gascogne, set fire to Miremont, destroyed Carbonne, Gimont and returned to his Bordeaux lands without difficulty.<br/><br/>Here, the Black Prince's army is represented by a wooden black tower figure (a black chess rook). The black tower will move around the playing area like the dragon (see Expansion 3 - The Princess &amp; the Dragon), destroying any towers it encounters. It will capture all the followers placed on them.<br/><br/>Towers cannot capture any follower placed on the same tile as the black tower.

If they are careful, they will complete decorating the tree with a Santa and a golden star at the top.<br/><br/>The designer has specialised in highly ornate games made using woodburning techniques. The game features a large number of intricately designed, hand-made pieces, brightly coloured to produce a highly attractive design.

Each subsequent bid must increase the number of words or the word length.<br/><br/>Each player has a scant few seconds to make a bid and each bid is an opportunity to drive the next player to unwisely overbid -- a core strategy.

The gravity-defying blocks and pigs and a handheld launcher allow kids to build, launch and destroy like never before! Includes: handheld launcher, planet base station, mounting bracket, 3 popular Angry Birds, 3 pigs, 10 blocks and bonus pieces and 2 x 3M Command strips. Suitable for ages 5+.<br/><br/>Object:  To score points by knocking down pigs, blocks and bonus pieces to score the most points.Level 1&bull;  Decide who will build the castle on the planet base and who will launch birds to    try and knock it down!&bull;  Build a castle on the Planet Base.  You may design your castle any way you want,     but you must use ALL the blocks, pigs and bonus pieces.&bull;  Launch the birds at the castle.  You get three tries, one for each bird.When launching a bird, hold the launcher in one hand, and then put your finger in the launcher ring to pull it back.  Then let go and watch it fly!<br/><br/>Any pig you knock off is worth 2 points, and any bonus piece you knock off is  worth one point. NOTE:  if the pig or bonus piece    is still attached to a block when you  knock  it off, it still counts.&bull;  Add up your points, then switch roles so that the player who launched the birds now builds the castle, and the person who built the castle will now launch the birds.&bull;  After both players have had a chance to score points, compare the results.  The player with the highest score wins the round.&bull;  If there is a tie score, the round doesn&rsquo;t count and you must play it over.&bull;  First player to win 2 rounds is the winner!Level 2&bull;  Level 2 is exactly the same game play as Level 1 but the scoring is different.  It&rsquo;s a little more complicated but there&rsquo;s also a      chance for more points!&bull;  Just like in Level 1, you have 3 chances (1 for each bird) to knock things off.  But in Level 2, you also get points for knocking off    blocks!  Also, EVERYTHING is worth more points.&bull;  Pigs are worth 75 points, Long Blocks are worth 50 points, Short Blocks are worth 25 points and Bonus Pieces are worth 10     points. &bull;  Just like in Level 1, compare points to determine the winner of each round.

Players join an epic, centuries-old war for the realm of Quadrenna. Here, four Kingdoms battle over a centrally located territory known as the Wastelands. The main Battlefield of this war is the intersection of these Kingdoms, where each struggles to prevent the other from achieving victory.<br/><br/>Through their Queens, the four Kingdoms summon Guardians from throughout time and around the galaxy in an attempt to gain control of the Wastelands. The Kingdoms&rsquo; main tools for winning the war are their two Guardians, each of which has unique strengths and weaknesses. Although the Guardians&rsquo; attitudes about being summoned vary, they all loyally serve their Kingdoms and find high honor in their duty.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of 3 phases, in this order: Move, Card, and Action. The Move and Action phases are optional, but the Card phase is required. Both Guardians act during each phase; you can choose the order in which your Guardians act.<br/><br/>A Kingdom achieves victory when it obtains ownership of the Wastelands. This is achieved one of three ways: kill all enemy Guardians, kill all enemy Kings, or take ownership of the Red Jewel Platform in the center by sacrificing 5 Red Jewels to it after your Kingdom is fully Upgraded.<br/><br/>",

The principal can never be taken out but every time a player passes GO they receive 10% interest. This can radically change the nature of the game, among other things speeding it up significantly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The Auction Game requires all properties to be auctioned when landed on for the first time. This tends to slow the game down and reduces reliance on luck somewhat.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Building Past Hotels allows further property development. This makes the cheaper monopolies more interesting.

Play is fairly standard (must follow suit, not required to trump) except that the aces in the non-trump suits are assassins which kill trump cards, and the trump ace is a guard which stops one assassin.<br/><br/>If the winning bid is in anarchy, there is no trump suit and cards are ranked ace high to ten low, with the face cards being equal below the ten; the jokers form their own &quot;pariah&quot; suit. If a pariah is led to a trick no one wins it.<br/><br/>Scoring depends on whether the play was in a suit or in anarchy, and if in a suit each player's score depends in part on what is taken by three of the other five players. The player who won the bid must always achieve their bid in points or be penalized; if the bid was in a suit then other players who last bid that suit must also do this.<br/><br/>Play is to 626 points.<br/><br/>There is an optional rule for an extra &quot;knife&quot; bid which basically means that the knifing player(s) work deliberately against the winning bidder.<br/><br/>",

They then find any subset of those seven cards that total exactly 34, set them aside, and deal cards to fill the empty slots.<br/><br/>If there is no way to make 34, the player chooses one of the two rows of cards to set aside and deals a new row. They can bring the set-aside row back in later by completely emptying the row of matching size. Several rows can be set aside at any given time.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a set of pawns that start in his or her corner of the board (this game is unique because the game boards layout is similar to swastika). The goal is to move the pawns around the board to the &quot;home&quot; section. Movement is controlled by dice. All players move around the same board, so they may capture each others pawns. Captured pawns are returned to their player's corner and must start their journey over. The winner is the first player to move all pawns &quot;home&quot;.<br/><br/>",

His vehicle included caterpillar tracks and a revolving turret with a 37mm gun, and looked very modern for its time. The War Ministry declined to accept it, but we&rsquo;re not limited by such thinking.<br/><br/>Imperial &amp; Royal Panzers is a variant for Infantry Attacks: Fall of Empires, with the Burstyn Motorgesch&uuml;tz and some other early attempts at armored vehicles like the Austro-Daimler armored car. But most of all, it gives you Austro-Hungarian tanks. In 1914.<br/><br/>It comes with 24 new die-cut, silky-smooth playing pieces. You also get a set of scenarios to turn these proto-panzers loose against the Russians (who do have those 76.2mm field guns, so this it&rsquo;s no walkover).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Although the rules do not explicitly reference Battlestar Galactica, this set of 55 custom hexagonal cards bears elements showing that the game was inspired by the seventies TV show, including two cards that display Cylon helmets and an Ovion &quot;Death Card.&quot; In keeping with the theme, there are rules regarding gameplay when the ship you are stationed on is at yellow or red alert status. Cheating is explicitly authorized in the rules, but with penalties for being caught. There are no face cards in the game. The cards of the four suits are ranked in value from 2 to 13 plus a Pyramid card. The three special cards with Cylon or Ovion markings round out the deck.<br/><br/>Galactic Poker comes with rules for four different games:<br/><br/>&quot;Pyramid&quot; - the name of a card game the characters played on the seventies TV series, Battlestar Galactica;<br/><br/>&quot;Red Eye&quot; - perhaps just a generic reference to Cylons, but Red-Eye is also the name of a specific Cylon character featured in a 1978 episode of the TV series;<br/><br/>&quot;Draw&quot; - in reference to a fast-draw western showdown with blaster pistols; and<br/><br/>&quot;Galactic Strip&quot; - which is exactly what the name implies - a game where you wager articles of clothing rather than money - and where the Death Card causes you to lose all of your attire, except for your blaster and holster!<br/><br/>Other Implementations of Pyramid<br/><br/>This implementation of Pyramid is different from that reflected in the game Triad (the name given to the card game in the newer version of the TV series) and appears to be an independently designed game rather than a variant of Triad. In addition, the cards shown in the BGG entry currently described (without attribution) as the &quot;Official Version&quot; of Pyramid appear to use the same artwork as this set, but that deck has 56 cards, with four Cylons and no Death Card.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>There are thousands of forms of Poker through out (sic) the galaxy. They differ only in details &amp; all basically follow the same elementary principles. The following rules are not the only games of Poker that can be played with these cards. They are a galactic deck which can be used for most any card game.<br/><br/>May the Lords smile upon you with great fortune!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Spades and Clubs allow you to put cards from your deck on top of an opponent&rsquo;s deck. Joker allow you to do special effects. Hearts and Diamonds allow you to draw cards while emptying your deck. As the rounds progress, 5 piles of cards are formed on the mat. The top visible cards of these piles form a combination. As soon as someone notices it, an additional effect is applied.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has no cards left. That player wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The Habsburg inheritance seemed almost intentionally designed to encourage predators, with its richest territories widely separated from the &ldquo;core lands&rdquo; and bordering her hungriest neighbors.<br/><br/>For the next eight years, almost all of Europe would be engaged in war as Maria Theresa fought to retain her crowns and exert her family&rsquo;s right to rule the Holy Roman Empire. France, Spain, Prussia and Sweden all lined up against her, while Britain and Russia only provided sporadic help. Despite a tiny army, weak finances and utter lack of competent generals, Maria Theresa somehow kept her empire intact.<br/><br/>Austrian Succession is an expansion book for Soldier Kings: Pragmatic Sanction, adding even more historical background to this unique conflict plus game variants plus scenarios for two additional wars: the 1733-1735 War of the Polish Succession and the 1735-1739 Austro-Russo-Turkish War.

        "description": "Nambarz is a game of mental arithmetic and strategy for adults and children, age 7 and up. Played by anywhere from 2 to 12 players at once, either as individuals or in teams, it is an educational game which promotes the practice of mental arithmetic, as well as strategic thinking, while having fun.<br/><br/>It does not require complex math exercises. The idea is to perform combinations of mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division) using numbers from 1 to 10. The goal of the game is that a player be the first to discard all of his or her cards. The sooner a player finishes, the better his or her ranking and the more points received.<br/><br/>There are two possible means of getting rid of cards : either by finding a card that matches the card which is face up in the card pile (that is, sharing the same face number or picture), or by doing mental math (which is not limited to a certain number of cards or number of mathematical operations). The latter allows a player to eliminate several cards at once.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s challenge is to find mathematical combinations that allow the elimination of a maximum number of cards at one time. It must be kept in mind that strategy is required, both in the choice of cards and in the order of the mathematical operations performed, in order to create an advantage in the next round or for a teammate&rsquo;s next play.<br/><br/>Four types of wildcards are included to make game strategy even more challenging and exciting. The variations that are built into the game allow players to advance gradually from beginners to seasoned players, depending on the number of wildcards that are used.<br/><br/>",

There is no Queen<br/>2. There are only 1 of each of these pieces: Rook, Knight, and Bishop<br/>3. There are 4 pawns instead of 8<br/>4. Adds a piece called a Diplomat which instead of capturing can suborn enemy pieces, making them changes sides rather than capturing.<br/>5. Pawns become more powerful because instead of changing direction to capture in 2 directions (diagonal right or left). They can capture in 3 directions (diagonal left/right or diagonal down). Pawns still need to move forward, but &quot;forward movement&quot; is defined as movement that moves the Pawn closer to the opposite side. So for that reason, the Pawns movement expands and it becomes a more powerful piece.<br/><br/>Diplomat Chess is different from Circular Chess because the board has a complete circle with 43 spaces, adds the Diplomat Piece, removes the Queen, and expands the movements of many pieces in the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player can either match the face card (ex. red scissors) with the same card (ex. blue scissors) of a different color or play a dominant card of same or different color (ex. rock would be played to crush scissors).  Most specialty cards only require you to match the top discard pile color, while the change color card requires the top discard card to be a different color.  It's a variety of playing same color, different color, dominate card and Rock, Paper, Scissors Battles.<br/><br/>When a battle card is played, you set down your cards and choose a player to battle against(traditional Rock Paper Scissors style). Play until a winner is determined.  Loser takes up to three cards depending on how many battles were used to determine a winner of the battle.<br/><br/>The player wins a hand by being the first to discard off of their cards.<br/><br/>The game is made up of hands.  You score points for each hand (10 points for going out, plus one point for each card left in the opponents hands)  Game play is to 20 multiplied by the number of players, except in two person games, it is simply the best of three.<br/><br/>Use two decks for 5+ players<br/><br/>",

Requires two sets of chess pieces, that even means two kings and two queens.  Each 3D row has alternating colors.  It is ideal to play facing each other along the long span of the board.  The game is intended to naturally extend the 2D-Chess game into 3D.<br/><br/>The game was inspired by the 3D chess and checker boards depicted on Star Trek.  A 18-page booklet was published in 1970 entitled &quot;The Complete Rules of Three Dimensional Chess&quot;.<br/><br/>All aspects of 2D-Chess are retained and extended into 3D, even some things you would not expect like &quot;Castling&quot; and &quot;En Passant&quot;.  However, there is one rule that remains ever unpopular and may seem counterintuitive.  'The Change in Distance Rule' (CID) It states that all diagonal or L-Shaped moves must advance or retreat to or from the opponent.  Yes, players do find it naturally intuitive to move on side-diagonals. But with the rule in place: The Rook nearly stays above the Knight in Piece-Power. Bishops &amp; Knights cannot just move around on their Back-Rank. This eliminates Extra Diagonal 3D King running room and expect a similar game length to regular chess.<br/><br/>Two-Kings?: The rules were simplified by Robert Jr.  It was very unpopular to have to checkmate both kings.  Therefore, a King-fork, and/or either King being Checkmated wins.<br/><br/>",

When the Clans invaded, ilKhan Ulric Kerensky saw in abandoned Qualip a chance to implement Nicholas Kerensky's vision for the Inner Sphere and the Clans, and the rechristened Kerensky's Vision became that chance. Setting Clan science to restore a paradise world lost to war created a planet unique in the occupation zone. On Kerensky's Vision, Clan and Inner Sphere merchants compete, while others smuggle, spy, and even steal in the packed enclaves of the capital. Here, anything can be bought, for a price.<br/><br/>Touring the Stars volumes consist of a color cover depicting an orbital view of the subject planet, a short history section, a small number of RPG tracks tailored to the planet, a rules annex detailing optional rules for games and scenarios set on the planet, a color world map and a hexed Battleforce 2 map.

It doesn't matter how you feel about the law, just make sure it passes.<br/><br/>On each player&rsquo;s turn, they&rsquo;ll propose a law by combining an &ldquo;Issue&rdquo; card and a &ldquo;Law&rdquo; card. The group can vote on this combination as-is, or another player (or several players) can propose an &ldquo;Exception&rdquo; card to be combined with these two cards.<br/><br/>As a group you all vote for the best combination and whether it includes an Exception, or if it&rsquo;s the original two card combination on its own. When a new law is passed, the proposing player keeps their &ldquo;Issue&rdquo; card as a win token, and if an Exception was passed with the law, the player that played the Exception card keeps their &ldquo;Exception&rdquo; card as a win token as well. The &ldquo;Law&rdquo; card is put back to the bottom of the deck to be reused if needed.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Law&rdquo; and &ldquo;Exception&rdquo; cards each count as a single point. At the end of the game, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

During the game you can use special cards which will give you strategic advantages and are designed to make the game fun and balanced.<br/><br/>After each round the control of the Castle port changes from one player to the next in clockwise order. A player can use the Explorer Spirit card to obtain the control of the port for the next 2 rounds,. The first player to obtain 5 keys and gain control on the castle port on his turn wins the game.<br/><br/>Battles are the only way to obtain keys. Every player starts with 3 keys and the remaining 2 keys need to be obtained from the neighbour players, the battle mechanics are based on a simple formula: dice points multiplied by the attack points plus the number of soldiers, during the match you can send a maximum of 20 soldiers for a battle and by default the number of attack points is 1, but it can be increased with the Brave Destiny Card. You can only launch an attack at your turn after collecting your village resources, If you win the battle you can claim 1 key and 5 coins if available. The loosing party will loose the number of soldiers sent to the battle unless he has hospitals to treat his soldiers.<br/><br/>After each battle the losing party will be allowed to draw a special card, the card needs to be displayed at any time to others, some cards are valid only once and need to be returned to the card pool, other cards are held permanently by the player. Only the defender can claim the special card and only the attacker can claim the key and the coins.<br/><br/>",

It's your job to gather them back together.<br/><br/>In this simple but engaging game, players try to complete sets of characters from famous stories, including Little Red Riding Hood, Alice in Wonderland, Urashima and the Kingdom Beneath the Sea, and Journey to the West.<br/><br/>Each player begins with a hand of four cards, and there is a face-down deck with two face-up cards on each side. On their turn, a player must discard a card to one of the face-up piles. They then draw from either the face-down deck or the other face-up pile.<br/><br/>The goal is to complete one of the four-character story sets or two of the two-character story sets. The first to complete such a set wins. To add to the fun, each character is only on one card but may appear in multiple stories, and the Black Hood card acts as a wild. Advanced rules, where you must play until winning twice in a row, are also available.<br/><br/>",

Descending into the dungeons of the tower, players find themselves in the very center of the labyrinth. All possible routes diverge from it, and the most distant rooms contain spell scrolls, only all passages are protected by magical seals of the four elements.<br/><br/>The search takes place in rounds, at the beginning of each of which the players, in turn, take three different-colored dice from the general supply and roll them. Sinces the mage can easily move from one point of the dungeons to another, if there is no obstacle in his way, it is very important not to give rivals a chance to steal the scroll from under your nose. To do this, you need to skillfully occupy strategically important passages with the chips of your mage and familiar. The collected scrolls not only bring victory points, but also allow you to manipulate dice, seal tokens lying on the playing field, and even the enemy.<br/><br/>The game end when a rounds ends with the number of scrolls with a strength of 6 is checked (at least 3 for 2-3 players or at least 4 for 4-5 players).<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the most victory points (the sum of all his scrolls and bonus points for spells).<br/><br/>There was room for five circles of magic in the box, and only two of them (one basic and one additional set of scrolls) are used in each batch. Each circle of magic has its own specialization, so their choice affects the nature of what is happening in the dungeons of the tower. This allows you to diversify the game and provides high replayability.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Five Deadly Venoms is a 3-player 18-card game that plays in 15-25 minutes. Each round, one player will face off against the other 2, attempting to earn coins by winning precisely the number of hands that they bid. The first player to win 7 coins, wins the game.<br/><br/>The name and theme come from a classic (1978) martial arts movie by the same name. It featured 5 evenly-matched deadly assassins whose techniques were based on venomous creatures. No one assassin could beat another but by teaming up, two might beat one.<br/><br/>The special features of the game are:<br/><br/>     Every hand pits one player against the other two.<br/>     The deck is comprised of one wild card (the Student), and 17 cards split among 5 suits with a carefully-crafted uneven distribution of card values among the suits.<br/>     Hands are resolved by comparing the two cards played by the lone player against two cards played (one each) by the other two players.<br/><br/><br/>The game is presented as a free print-and-play. The rules reference a bid token, but it is optional. The bid token is a disc with a numeral &quot;3&quot; on one side and a &quot;4&quot; on the other. It indicates who bid and how many hands they bid. The rules also mention 21 tokens/coins. These are used for tracking the score. Use any tokens you prefer or keep track of the score with paper and pencil.<br/><br/>I recommend keeping a copy of the card distribution (the last page of the rulebook) out in front of players. It helps players keep track of the unconventional distribution of the cards among the suits.<br/><br/>I really hope you enjoy the game. It's small and quick, but it has some depth in the play. If you're familiar with Euchre, it's a bit like a 3-player version in which one player always goes alone.<br/><br/>It's a nice filler for when you're waiting for other players to arrive.<br/><br/>",

It is extremely rare and frowned upon for anyone other than Samurai to take up a bow for whatever reason. However, the Shiho, with little access to black powder, have made the bow a formidable part of their arsenal. Shiho Shota, a master of Kyudo, has been training loyal Shiho Ashigaru to use this weapon to devastating effect. They can fire several volleys and disappear into the underbrush before an enemy force can even sound a call-to-arms. Shiho Hiroto, never one for rules or archaic tradition was ecstatic to learn that he had some of the finest archers in Jwar who were not Samurai but loyal Ashigaru instead. Shiho Hiroto is a champion of the people and not the power that forces them into submission.<br/>They may only be Ashigaru, but they have a pool of three ranged and access to the Lightweight trait, making them some of the best missile troops in Bushido. For 14 Rice, they have outstanding Range - and Strength - and can keep their distance to stay safe. With the Eagle Feather Arrow as a choice, it gives them that chance to let loose that one vital shot that must do damage at all costs.<br/><br/>Blister contains two miniatures, 30mm bases and a full colour profile card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After leaving Hell, L. enters Purgatory and finds it being consumed by shadows. Using the energy of her soul, she tries to fight off the darkness, but it may just be enough to shine the path and escape. You will take on the role of L. to save her from being consumed...lost...forgotten...<br/><br/>Purgatorio is a beautiful solo game inspired by Dante's journey in the Divine Comedy. In this game, you will manage L.'s soul's energy and try to light the forest up. Her energy is greatly limited, so you must figure out a way to recycle it as much as you need. The darkness will come, and it will reduce her energy to zero, so be quick...but clever.<br/><br/>During a turn, you will use up to two Energy cards and resolve the effect depending on the combination and placement of those cards; these effects are revealing and/or moving through Purgatory tiles, storing and restoring Energy (cards), and dealing with the Shadows (cards). Your objective is to reveal 18 tiles before you lose all your energy or lose 8 tiles to the shadows. The Shadow cards will be cycling in and out of your deck depleting your cards and the tiles.<br/><br/>If you want to help playtest the game, you can find it here: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2965489069\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=29654...</a><br/>And here is a questionary you can fill up: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://forms.gle/5nruRtZSvkMyP5ps5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://forms.gle/5nruRtZSvkMyP5ps5</a><br/>I'll be updating the game accordingly :)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rome, LLC. is a game of the Eastern Byzantine Empire and Western Frankish Empire from the unification of the Frankish Kingdom by King Chlothar II in 613 CE. to the disastrous defeat of Emperor Romanos IV to the Seljuk Turks at Manzikert in 1071 CE, which precipitated the Crusades.<br/> Heraclius overthrew the Emperor Phocas in 610 CE, but his prolonged war with Persia weakened the Byzantine Empire, which almost collapsed to the might of Islam and the invading Avars, Bulgars, and Slavs. The Empire survived thanks to the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, the secret of Greek Fire, and capable leaders such as John Kurkuas, John Tzimiskes, and Basil the Bulgar-Killer, who reconquered territory lost to the barbarians.<br/><br/>King Chlothar II united the Frankish Kingdom in 613 CE, but his inept successors were replaced by the warlord Charles Martell, who repelled the Islamic Invasion at Tours in 732 CE. His grandson Charlemagne invaded Germany, Spain, and Italy and in 800 CE was crowned Emperor by Pope Leo III, reviving the Western Roman Empire. Like its predecessor the Frankish Empire slowly fell apart, divided by civil war, and devastated by Norse and Magyar raiders. The last Carolingian ruler died in 987 CE and the empire split into warring kingdoms.<br/><br/>Two players may play Rome, LLC. one controlling the Eastern Byzantine Empire and the other the Western Frankish Empire. The Byzantines have the larger, wealthier, empire, but their enemies are more dangerous. The weaker economy of the Franks makes them more dependent on allies and marcher lords to guard the frontier and must expand their kingdom into an empire. Each plays their own game side-by-side, with their own statesmen and units, co-operating against invading Arabs, Avars, Bulgars, Magyars, Moors, Norse, Rus, Saxons, Seljuks, and Slavs. The game may be played solitaire, with the player either controlling one empire, or both at the same time.<br/><br/>Each empire has its own statesmen who are made emperors, kings, governors, or rebels. They are rated for their military, administration, religion, and intrigue abilities, and each has a special ability. St Boniface reformed the Frankish Church and the evangelist of Germany, so is a Western Statesman with 1 Military ability, 4 Administration ability, 5 Religious ability, 2 Intrigue ability, and the Convert special ability.<br/><br/>The map has provinces grouped into commands with their own governors, who collects taxes, quells insurgents, fights wars, but may assassinate their emperor or rebel and start a civil war. Emperors counters are used to change commands and rules and determine which statesmen of the new dynasty will become emperor, regardless of their abilities (or lack thereof).<br/>Cavalry, Guards, Auxilia, Forts, and Fleets are used to fight wars and garrison provinces, with some provinces held by allies or marcher lords to protect the frontier from barbarians. Enemy leaders and wars move from province to province until defeated, encouraging revolts, and shrink the empires. Fighting a war may result in a triumph, which removes the war, increases prestige, reduces unrest, generates gold, and annexes provinces, but may also lead to a disaster or bloody stalemate.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by winning Prestige, which is earned by imperial administration, annexing provinces, defeating wars, and financing prestige projects. The loss of both Constantinople and Rome to the barbarians results in defeat, but bankruptcy and unrest can also drive an empire to destruction.<br/><br/>Rome, LLC. uses the system from Rome, Inc. (ATO 53). Each turn represents 5-10 years, with 10 turns in each scenario. The five scenarios start in 610 CE, 711 CE, 814 CE, 888 CE, and 973 CE which may be combined into campaign games. Players may continue the scenarios from Rome, Inc. and Rome, IInc. into Rome, LLC. allowing them to play 17 consecutive scenarios covering 1500 years of history.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game board and play resembles that of Checkers, but captured pieces remain on the board and can possibly be freed later in the game.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game on the 7x7 board with eleven soldiers. On a turn, a player moves one soldier diagonally forward one space. If a capture is available, then the player must make that capture, trapping the captured piece underneath the capturing one; if the newly captured piece had previously had one or more pieces underneath it, then those pieces are now free to move in future turns. If a soldier reaches the opponent's back row, it's flipped and promoted to an officer, which can move diagonally in all directions. The game continues until either a player can't move or a player has no pieces remaining on the board. In both cases, this player loses the game.<br/><br/><br/>In Chaos, The object of the game is to move your six playing pieces from one side of the board to the opposite side.  The game is played by either two or four players.  The catch is that the pieces all look identical; they are identified by a colored ring on their underside only.<br/><br/>On your turn, you move a piece forward, sideways or diagonally, possibly jumping over a single piece (a series of jumps is possible if the right gaps are present, as in Checkers).  When a piece reaches the far side, it is turned over to reveal its true owner.  If yours, it stays there; if not, it reverts to its indistinguishable side and its true owner must move it on his next turn.  During play, you can also challenge the ownership of a piece being moved.  The incorrect player forfeits his turn.<br/><br/>",

When playing Curda, the values are reversed and a lower number wins over a higher number. Where the Chanta appears, the best card does not win, but the one that follows in value. Mu&ntilde;eca Brava beats any man, even Carlos Gardel. In turn, Cafishio beats any woman, even the Viejita. When Garufa appears, there is a party and the one who wins the trick has to give it away. Misteriosa Mascarita is a card with gender to define, will it be male, will it be papusa?<br/><br/>The game is learned quickly and its rules barely occupies the first four pages of the book. The rest of the volume links pieces of tangos, memorable lyrics that act as background music for the game, breathing life into it and giving thickness to each card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the book back cover<br/><br/><br/>&iexcl;Ju&eacute;guese un tango!<br/><br/>A partir de las historias que cuentan las letras de tango naci&oacute; Tango de Mente, una nueva baraja y un pasatiempo para practicar entre amigos.<br/><br/>Sentados los jugadores a la mesa, las cartas van y vienen. Cuando se juega Curda, los valores se invierten y un n&uacute;mero menor pasa a ganarle a uno mayor. Donde aparece el Chanta no gana la mejor carta, sino la que le sigue en valor. Mu&ntilde;eca Brava le gana a cualquier hombre, incluso a Carlos Gardel. A su vez, Cafishio le gana a cualquier mujer, incluso a la Viejita. Cuando aparece Garufa, hay fiesta y el que gana la baza tiene que regalarla.

A set of red letters are placed in the center of play available to all. One player shuffles the deck of 36 cards, then reveals the top card. If the card shows a letter, everyone takes this letter from their set and places it somewhere on their grid, either face up as the letter or face down as a block (similar to a black space in a crossword puzzle). If the card shows &quot;FREE&quot; &mdash; a designation on the J, Q, X, and Z &mdash; then you can instead choose a red letter from the center area to add to your grid.<br/><br/>After all 36 cards have been revealed, score any words that you have created when you read your grid left to right and top to bottom, with each letter in each word being worth 1 point. Letters that are not part of a word are worth 0 points, and if every combination of letters on your grid forms a word, then you have created a &quot;perfect square&quot; and score 12 bonus points.<br/><br/>The rules suggest playing multiple games until someone passes 500 points. Questo can also be played as a solo game, with a player trying for the best score possible, with 52+ being quite difficult.<br/><br/>",

As winter approaches, you disagree on how to proceed: some of you want to risk it and move south across the ice barrier, another prefers to stay and wait, and the third thinks it best to go straight back to the old home. One evening you will come together to make a decision.<br/><br/>You lead one of the three groups and want to enforce your opinion with your 6 people. To do this, you take turns placing character cards between you and one of the other two groups so that one half of the card faces towards you and the other half faces the rival group. One half of the card has a numerical value that shows how convincing the person is in the discussion. With the other half, you use the person's special ability. So you always have to decide which side you want to benefit from and which side you might concede to another camp.<br/><br/>With these special abilities you can swap cards, turn them, or even knock other tribe members unconscious. This also allows you to influence the row of cards between the other two, because otherwise you can only place cards to the left or right of you, but not opposite.<br/><br/>When all the cards are played, see which of you won this primitive debate.

It&rsquo;s a risky endeavor, requiring proper timing, thoughtful management of your resources, and a bit of old-fashioned good luck.<br/><br/>Choose your location, roll your dice, and see what you've caught. If you succeed, sell your catch strategically to earn top dollar. If you don't succeed, use your failures wisely, to improve your operation for next season.<br/><br/>This is a solitaire, print-and-play, roll-and-write design.

        "description": "TropeQuest pokes fun at everyone's favorite sci-fi and fantasy stereotypes and puts them literally into the hands of the players, who attempt to turn a pile of genre fiction cliches into a workable narrative. It's a creative, collaborative game with a lighthearted competitive element that uses cards and a board to make it fun and easy for players to improvise an original story. Best of all, it generates a unique tale each and every time it's played.<br/><br/>The board provides the story arc, a plot map that packs as many cliched scenarios and overwrought plot twists as possible into fifteen squares. The deck brings the setting... a library of genre tropes and oblique pop culture references to tickle the imaginations of geeks and laypersons alike. Players and encouraged to mix, match, and try out new combinations.<br/><br/>After a deck of tropes and a plot board are chosen, players are each dealt a hand of cards and take turns being the Narrator. The Narrator reads the prompt on the next available square and chooses a card from a pool of trope cards submitted by adjacent players (plus one random from the deck) to finish the prompt. While this may yield some hilarious results, the Narrator's work has not yet begun! Next, the Narrator &quot;sells&quot; the scene by elaborating, tying up loose ends, spicing it up a bit. Afterwards, the players redraw cards, the player whose card was picked draws an extra one, and the next player becomes the Narrator. Rinse and repeat until all fifteen squares have been played and the story has reached its thrilling climax.<br/><br/>So, the story is over. What was the point of it all? Well, in a way, the goal of the game is to laugh, have fun, and tell a quirky story together. However, in another, more mathematical and literal way, the goal of the game is to win by having more cards than anyone else at the end of the game. But winning also comes with great responsibility! After the gloating is over, the winner then chooses their favorite scene in the story Narrated by another player. That player then becomes the Chosen One, Master of Tropes and The Uber-Winner of that round of TropeQuest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Civilisations is a card game about building competing ancient civilisations over three Ages <br/>Each Age has a different deck of cards. At the start of the game the first Age is divided into a number of hands equal to the number of players plus an extra hand which is set aside.<br/>The set aside hand means that the card mix if different for each game, creating a strong replay value.<br/>Each player then chooses a card from their hand and these cards are played simultaneously, paid for with Gold from your civilisations treasury.<br/>Most cards have Military and/or Culture values and all cards have a special effect. When the card is played the special effect is resolved. These effects do things like enhancing other cards already in play, scoring extra points for certain cards, making certain types of cards cheaper to buy, removing or stealing cards from opponents and a host of other things to.<br/>Some special effects are triggered by circumstances and if not triggered when played will wait until a later turn when their trigger condition is met.<br/>Cards which target other players usually target a random card and/or a random player to prevent players ganging up one someone and ruining their fun.<br/>After playing a card, hands are passed round the table clockwise, giving you new options and choices to make.<br/>Once each player has played 6 cards the Age ends and the player with the card with the highest single Military score gains a Colonisation culture bonus and then players may choose to declare War on each other. Winning a war gets you a small amount of gold but, more importantly, destroys a random card from your opponent.<br/>At the end of the third Age Culture scores are added up to find out who won.<br/>The game was written with the following in mind:<br/><br/>     A game should take 1-2 hours (my attention span now is about 2 hours.. age is great :)<br/>     The game can be played on a card or kitchen table<br/>     Set-up and take down time for a game is less than 5 minutes<br/>     You don't need to refer to the rulebook in play, everything you need to know is on the cards (e.g. card abilities are clearly explained in plain english)<br/>     There is a degree of randomness which stops players ganging up on other players<br/>     The game allows direct (war and espionage) and indirect competition (choosing cards which you know your opponent would like)<br/>     No one gets &quot;knocked out&quot; or falls so far behind as not to be able to win. Games are nearly always very close.<br/>     Every decision is interesting and important, you will nearly always want to play more than one of the cards in your hand and have to choose which very carefully<br/>     Choosing cards which interact with each other in positive ways is critical to victory, but the swapping of hands requires some careful forethought on what cards to play and when and also allows you to mess with your opponents by playing cards they want!<br/>     Each game is unique and you have to adapt to the cards you are given<br/><br/><br/>The core game focuses on the region around the Mediterranean sea and Carthage, the Celts, Greece, Rome, Persia and Egypt as playable civilisations.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players challenge each other to get out of their comfort zones in fun and affirming ways using challenge prompt cards and the roll of a 12-sided die.<br/><br/>How to play: Players all draw four cards. One Player (the Dealer) chooses a prompt from her cards or makes up her own for one or more Players and assigns the odds of it happening using the 12-sided die. If Players consent to the challenge and odds, the Dealer rolls the die and the play either commences or not. Regardless of the outcome, the Player who accepted the challenge becomes the new Dealer. Discard and draw a new card when you've played both prompts on your card. Play Wild Cards when it suits you. Incorporate as many variations and inspirations as you like. Be adventurous. Be good to each other. Dealers can prompt one or every play with every turn, including themselves.<br/><br/>On winning and losing: Traditionally, the gameplay is not competitive. However, for those who like the added tension, players can win by collecting points for consenting to a proposal IF and  ONLY IF they are not then required to perform the feat based on the role of the die. The first player to 15 points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

From them, Souls manifest and engage in battle for complete omnipotence. Enhance your Souls with Quirks which provide unique abilities and allow them to ascend into Entities of considerable power. Change the tides of battle with Events that become reality through the magic of these Crystals. Be wary! When one of these great Monoliths shatters and falls upon itself, the gate of creation closes with it. Wage war against other crystal wielders; use your mighty Gate Crystals and their adaptable creations to claim Omni for your own!<br/><br/>Game starts with players selecting a Soul from their Existence deck (&quot;Monster&quot; pool) to begin the battle, placing one crystal on their board, and drawing three cards from their Standard deck (Event and Quirk deck). During a player's turn, they can improve their Souls by equipping Quirks and eventually Ascending them into Entities, by meeting the required EvoVal points for the Entity chosen (determined by Quirks' cumulative EvoVals). Players may also play &quot;Stabilizers&quot; or &quot;Destabilizers&quot; (Omni's equivalent to &quot;Spells and Traps&quot;) that will have an immediate impact on the gameplay. There are no &quot;Deck Outs&quot; in Omni - simply reshuffle the Standard deck and continue play. Once all of a player's Crystals or Souls are destroyed, they have lost the game. They may also surrender at any point.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Das Feel Good Spiel is a card-based game that is all about expressing affection and appreciation for your loved ones by answering the questions on the cards. The game helps to create a conscious moment for compliments and nice words.<br/><br/>The small cards support players in finding the right expressions and give ideas for different topics they want to highlight with compliments. The game is not about winning or losing, but solely about positive vibes and the players' well-being. In the course of the game, the players compliment each other and express their mutual appreciation in a creative way. On 100 cards, there are numerous ideas for kind words, encouragement and compliments.<br/><br/><br/>     In each round, one person receives compliments from their fellow players.<br/>     One person draws a card with a compliment idea and reads it aloud.<br/>     The other players add their own personal compliment and write it on a piece of paper.<br/>     Afterwards, all compliments are read aloud.<br/><br/><br/>The game can be played with in a variation where each player has to guess who wrote down what and receives one point per correct guess. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

This year, the competition is extra fierce, there are strange rumours going around of unusual behaviour. It is the night before the grand jury comes by and you are not leaving anything to chance, calling upon dark forces from beyond to grow your pumpkin the biggest and even sabotaging your neighbours gardens.<br/><br/>Little Drawington: Halloween is a draw and draw game, where players draw cards with shapes they then get to draw on their own garden boards.<br/><br/>The game consists of 3 repeating phases and a final evaluation round The phases are: The Ghastly Growing Phase, the Creepy Carving Phase, and the Demonic Decoration Phase.<br/><br/>When the deck of root cards has run out, the sun rises and players  add up their points. The player with the most points win. The garden boards look like little clipboards from the town council, so as players are creating their gardens they are also filling in what the garden looks like on a scoring form for the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

The race card to be used for each game round can be chosen by a player from any number of drawn cards in his deck. However, if you draw a lot of cards to choose from, you will also use a lot of gasoline. Once the race card pile is used up, the fuel card is turned over once and the race card pile is refilled. The fuel card can only be reactivated during a pit stop. The selected cards per player are turned face up at the same time, and the race cars are drawn in order of highest card. It is possible to block tracks, slip on oil fields and of course you have to slow down in corners. Special cards allow special moves and can be used once per pit stop.

        "description": "SpiralChain: Foreverot is a fully cooperative board game based on the SpiralChain novels by Jeremiah L. Schwennen. Between one and eight players work together to defeat the Foreverot before it can unleash untold suffering upon the Spiral of Worlds. The players win or lose as one--there are no victory points to tally or secret agendas to work towards.<br/><br/>Each player will have a Role Card that gives them special abilities to aid in their efforts, and each world has a limited number of enigmatic guardian dragons that might be employed to help fend off Warlords and Obliviates.<br/><br/>Players will travel from world to world gathering resources and making occasional forays into Nur to discard Rot Tokens until all eight of those tokens have been discarded and the heroes emerge victorious. But things are never quite that easy, are they? Gathering resources is made more difficult by the presence of maniacal Warlords that seek to destroy key locations on each world and malevolent Obliviates--scouts for the Foreverot--that block the heroes' efforts wherever they can. The same resources that are used to stop the Rot must also be used to vanquish Warlords and Obliviates, making for tough choices in each and every round of play. And the clock is always against you.<br/><br/>At the end of each round of play, the current First Player will roll a die in a grim responsibility we call the Foreverot Roll. This die will determine whether or not the Rot advances in its own schemes, wreaking havoc across the game. If those schemes advance too far--if all of the Foreverot Cards on Nur are played--the Rot will win. But even if the die roll is kind and a new Foreverot Card is not played, damage will be visited upon worlds and Warlords will continue in their inexorable march, bringing ruin to whatever lies in their path.<br/><br/>In about an hour, the fate of the 8 worlds can be decided... but in the quest to forge the Spiralchain, almost anything can happen!<br/><br/>",

Ultimately, the family with the most social status, wealth, popularity, and provincial control is declared the winner. To gain supremacy you must ensure that statesmen affiliated with your family wage successful military campaigns, govern prosperous provinces, control key industries, and implement effective political reforms.<br/><br/>Julii is a 2-4 player game that starts in 264 BC at the outbreak of the 1st Punic War and ends with the turmoil and civil wars of the late 1st Century BC. A full game is played over 10 turns, with each turn representing approximately 20-25 years.

Eventually, the unpredictability of the seasons, the power of the floods, and the fragility of infrastructure contributed to the abandonment of cities--leaving only ruins to mark these impressive achievements.<br/><br/>Today, modern technology and sheer hubris have resulted in a new set of settlements that again attempt to thrive in one of the world&rsquo;s harshest and driest climates. With the help of modern engineering marvels like the Hoover Dam and the Central Arizona Project canal, more than 7 million people call Arizona home and over 100,000 more residents move there each year. How long can this continue before, like other civilizations of old, nature asserts its dominance and returns the cities to dust?<br/><br/>Watershed: Arizona is a turn-based asymmetrical game played in rounds. Each round consists of the following:<br/> 1.    Revealing climate conditions card which modifies the precipitation coming to the watersheds<br/>2.    Revealing and resolving policies that impact watershed conditions, city building and water infrastructure<br/>3.    Simultaneous city building using workers and card playing<br/>4.    Watershed stewardship and infrastructure building<br/>5.

Ah, maybe we should rope off that area so no one gets too close?<br/><br/>Your goal: Gain the most points by being the most clever greenthumb!<br/><br/>Players will be using worker placement to feed the plants in the shop or add new plants to the shop in the form of dominoes. Players will stacking dominoes to create new levels with each level scoring for the greatest number of a value, with lower floors being hidden as the players stack, will they know what&rsquo;s down below and plant those matching flowers in their greenhouses?<br/><br/>This tricky game of playing dominoes for the value and also stacking them gives players an elevated gaming experience. There&rsquo;s also a dice customer or two each round who might visit the shop. Hopefully you can keep the man eating plants from doing what they do best! Or you may want to feed your opponents&rsquo; cloned shop assistants to the plants, but be aware that they also get the bonus you earn for doing so, while losing an assistant of course.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last domino makes it to the shop. Players score their greenhouses as multipliers with each level, maximizing their scores as they go.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When building traditional jigsaw puzzles, there are several tactics people use. One can look for pieces by their image or their shape.One can build the whole puzzle at the same time or concentrate on building a specific section of it. Organise the pieces before starting to build or dive right into it. Doing the border first, looking for a one of a kind piece and so on.<br/><br/>In Jigsuw, players need to master not only the different tactics to build a puzzle but also when to change from one to another. They start by setting down the large circular core of the puzzle flat on the table. From there, the players divide the rest of the pieces among themselves, then it&rsquo;s off to the races. They compete to set down the pieces against the starting circle as fast as possible until the puzzle is complete.<br/><br/>What makes Jigsuw interactive is that players don&rsquo;t just try to build the puzzle faster, but instead they need to try block their opponents. You block their pieces when you set down all surrounding ones before they get the chance to put theirs down. At this moment they cannot play it. The game continues until no one can lay down any pieces. Whoever ends the game with less pieces blocked wins the match.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately some customers can be very demanding, and this can cause some stress to the hardworking employees. Perhaps buying some gifts for these workers at the end of the week might make them happier?<br/><br/>The game is divided in 4 rounds and each round has two phases. On the first phase, customer cards and gem cards are opened on the table and players secretly distribute their discount tokens on their boards. Then, each customer will buy a gem from the player who offered the best discount. Some customers cause the staff's mood to go down. Then, on the second phase, present cards are opened and each card is auctioned by players. The gifts can be used to improve the employees&acute; mood and avoid negative points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>After the fourth round all players get points acording to the clients attended, gems sold, the employees' mood and the money left. The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Can the humans reboot the A.I. or make it to the launch vehicle before the hidden infection achieves Total Contamination.<br/><br/>In this game all players begin in human form but one of you is secretly an alien infection that has assumed the guise of one of the humans. During play, infected players may infect others. The uninfected humans struggle to expose and defeat the aliens. The aliens attempt to defeat and contaminate the humans. However if too many humans become contaminated, then the aliens will turn on each other.<br/><br/>The game board represents a small, domed science station on an icy world, with a launch vehicle ready for lift off outside.<br/><br/>At the start of the game there is only one infected card in play. As play progresses more such cards accumulate and infected characters may end up infecting others by sharing to them. Each turn players choose one or two actions (move, combat or a task). The location on the board will make certain tasks available, such as using the bio analysis drone from the drone hub. Other players whose characters are nearby can help, hinder or watch. Cards are played to show how things turn out. When the dust settles the active player also gets to share cards with someone who helped or hindered.<br/><br/>If a player is forced to reveal an infection card in their hand face up, then their character changes from human form (blue) to monster form (red). Monster form can perform fewer tasks but can easily attack and infect others.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of these conditions is met:<br/><br/>     the AI is fully reprogrammed using uninfected cards, or with 2 or 3 infected cards giving an infection win<br/>     the launch vehicle lifts off. If any character on board is infected that becomes an infection win.<br/>     all players are in monster form, which produces an infection win.<br/><br/><br/>If a human victory occurs, all uninfected humans win.<br/><br/>If an infection victory occurs only a limited number of infected players win, as the infection organisms are very competitive.<br/><br/>",

We are designing each puzzle ourselves specifically for The Labyrinth, and are placing an emphasis on immersive puzzles with physical objects and unique solutions.<br/><br/>To complete the challenge, you must use clues to solve many smaller puzzles, which will lead to other clues in a larger interwoven narrative. Once you solve the smaller puzzles, you can  combine the solutions in order to unlock and solve the overarching meta-puzzles.<br/><br/>Solving all of the puzzles in the Labyrinth Puzzle Challenge will provide at least 8-10 hours of puzzle-solving and clue-cracking for a group of 3-4 people. The challenge can be played individually or with a group, and the game includes a huge number of puzzles and associated content. We have designed puzzles that will be accessible to people who have never participated in a puzzle hunt or escape room, as well as puzzles that will challenge even the most experienced puzzle hunters and escape room addicts. Some puzzles will be easily and quickly solved, while others require a more in-depth examination. The complete Labyrinth challenge is designed to provide hours of entertainment and immersion into this unique experience, with a story that unfolds as the puzzles progress.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

On the spaces with a dot he has to place 1 or 2 tokens upside down beside the space.<br/><br/>Instead of rolling the dice a player may turn one arrow token on the track of another player to cause him to have to use the cedit track. Each player can be caused to use each of his two credit tracks only one time.

In each round the first player draws the top card of the deck and puts it face up on the table. The card will contain a mathematical equation that could be as simple as &quot;b-ac=&quot; and as complex as for example &quot;3bc/a  - df/e =&quot;.<br/>Players then spread out the dice around the equation's variables in their sheets, roll the dice and calculate their results based on the dice values and how they put them in the equation.<br/>Each round has a twist on the main game rules. In one of the rounds you are giving points to the other players, so your goal would then be to minimize the equation's result.<br/><br/>",

If you're there now - you will be back to the daily terror instead of playing to relax. If you're about to do it - you may decide not to! Like we just said - congratulations!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>You step into the uncomfortable shoes of a parent whose sweet offspring brings him joy at the same time and seems to be trying to destroy him. All parents are different: there are businessmen and punks, politicians, managers, athletes, but they are all united by one thing - they try to survive without going crazy. Well, of course, and win. Each role has pros and cons, starts with different levels of health, sanity and money and has an individual special skill. There are two ways to win - you are either the last to be still alive or the first to get to 30 health and sanity.<br/><br/>MECHANICS<br/>Before starting the game, do the following:<br/>Give a random parent card to each player. Return the unused ones to the box.<br/>Put cubes to indicate the current levels of sanity and health (initial values ​​are marked on the parent cards).<br/>Shuffle all the playing cards and create a deck. Place it in the middle of the table.<br/>Give 4 cards to each player, as well as the starting money marked on their parent card. Three cards are then removed from the pile of cards and the top one is turned over so that it is visible to everyone.<br/>You are now ready to begin. Each action in the game is determined by the cards you play or are already in front of you.<br/><br/>FIRST ROUND: The last person to have become a parent takes the three cards without bidding anything, the other players take one card from the deck. If there is no parent between you, skip the first round and start directly from the second.<br/><br/>EVERY NEXT ROUND: You bid for the three cards visible on the market. With shouting, cunning, insults and everything. The one who bets the most wins. There are no restrictions on bidding - you can always intervene. The one who wins the bidding takes the three cards he has bid for. The others take one card from the top of the pile. The winner of the bidding starts first and can play as many cards as he wants - without restrictions. After him is the next player in clockwise direction. When everyone is done, it's time for the next round, which repeats the second round. And so on until a winner is announced in one of two ways:<br/>Either the last survivor or the first who reaches 30 health and sanity.<br/><br/>",

But building has to be done with care, straw can stack on anything, but sticks only stack on sticks and bricks and bricks only stack on bricks.<br/><br/>Players also have an opportunity to raise livestock, building them stables and if they have a pair and an empty stable, they can get baby Unicorns, Llamas, and Cows!<br/><br/>Players also try to keep their fairy tale pals safe from the Big Bad Wolf Sheriff, Red Riding Hood, Billy goat gruff and Puss in Boots need your help!<br/><br/>Players will get to be strategic with their dice in that they can space the 3 pigs out on the rondel, but doing so makes them susceptible to being arrested by the Wolf who is also moving around the rondel. Or they can stack their piggies, less opportunity to get exactly the action they want, but less likely to be arrested also!<br/><br/>The game plays until a player has completed all 3 sections of their hideout. Then players score on their sheets. The game is a roll and write in that the players roll dice and mark their player sheet based on the actions they completed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scientists on your homeworld have discovered that the true nature of the universe is not unlike a Dark Forest, with solar systems connected by branches of a Cosmic Tree. Your people have started to travel to nearby stars, but even so, you have not found other advanced life. Obsessed with the search for your cosmic brothers and sisters, you set out exploring from your homeworld. To aid in exploration, your scientists have invented The Singularity Probe, a machine that can travel into space and speed up time, turning the millennia it would take to travel to the stars into hours. As a side effect of time speeding up however, life on nearby planets grows in leaps and bounds every time the Probe causes one of these leaps in time. Oversee and guide the development of life in the Universe, and discover whether we are alone in the Dark Forest.<br/><br/>In this action selection game, players will use Seekers to Sow the seeds of life on planets, Settle their own Watchers on a planet, and plan jumps to new solar systems that will occur during the next Leap in time. Watchers then will work to Suppress or Elevate the native life on a planet, tending them for a later Reaping, or perhaps helping them evolve to higher forms of life. Each new planet you discover will have unique properties, yielding a new worker placement spot that will alter the possible strategies in the game. The winner of the game is the first to find and make peace with an Ancient Civilization, if one exists, or to become the only advanced species in the universe if not.<br/><br/>",

But the cat keeps being naughty.<br/><br/>Players are dealt a hand of cards, numbered from 1 to 12 in six colours. There are also some special action cards, including a joker. The start player (who most recently cleaned) lays out a card and players must play a card or combos that are better, or pass. Once everyone has passed, the last player to play leads the next round.<br/><br/>Cards must be played out in the style of [thing15878], in sets and runs, which can include the jokers. So a pair of 4s can be raised by a pair of 5s, or by three 8s. But three 3s won't do, nor a run of any kind. Likewise, if a run is lead, it can be raised by better runs, but not by sets.<br/><br/>As cards are played out, the cat marker is moved down, and when it hits zero, the players hands are scored. The player with the most points is covered in pawprints, and the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>The publisher says the game is easy enough for young players to enjoy.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

As they place a tile, they can add player pieces, or a pawn worth 2 pieces. If a tile gets to four pieces, it is confident enough to stay. But if it has fewer than four, then some black balls are added to make it up to four.<br/><br/>When a continent is completed, it is scored. Players with the most pieces/pawns get the most points (counting all the pieces on the island), for having been most confident in their memory of the voyage. The next most gets the points of the majority pieces, and so on down. There are bonus points for places of interest on the land (buried treasure) and for adjacent sea monsters.<br/><br/>But the black balls are collected by the majority scorer, and count as negative at the end of the game, along with any player pieces remaining in hand.<br/><br/>The game ends when ten black balls have been used.<br/><br/>The game is a mix of co-operating, and bluffing to complete island with the most confidence.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

The first player to recruit three heroes, such as Dracula, Succubus, Vorpal Bunny, or Hanako in the toilet, is the winner.<br/><br/>One player acts as Satan and defends a large castle, made from staggered boxes as a dias, with a throne at the top. The other players have a Demon King, one of eight such as Lucifer, Cthulhu, or Nurarihyon. Each Demon King starts with special abilities to help the player.<br/><br/>The game uses highly decorated plastic cards. The player takes their plastic Demon King card and inserts it vertical into a base card. This creates a flicking device. By holding the base down, and bending the card back, a player can flick their small foam creatures up onto the castle levels. Satan can defend the castle platform with its own cards, or use whatever toys or plushies a player has to hand.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, the attackers try to steal money from the castle, and use this to recruit 'heroes' to their side. These heroes bring more powers and abilities to the cause, and strengthen the attack in different ways. For example, the Vorpal Bunny increases the attack magnification to the throne by 100 times and exerts super high firepower, but Hanako in the toilet nullifies the attack on the throne. Getting Hanako-san from the toilet keeps the player with Vorpal Bunny in check. Players can choose to work together, and a player might even be better off attacking themselves. The game system is very open and fluid in the way the characters' abilities work.<br/><br/>The first player to gain three heroes to their side is the winner.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

In other words, the front side of the piece expresses the ability as a unit, but when it is damaged and becomes the back side, it expresses the ability of the individual military commander. In terms of wargames, the front side is the operational level and the back side is the tactical level. If the soldiers are lost due to damage, the military commander will fight directly.<br/>There is also a twist on the victory conditions.

The Eastern Army is controlled by the game system and attacks / counterattacks according to the rules. This system is partly based on the system of VPG's The Barbarossa Campaign.<br/>It is said that the Battle of Sekigahara was won by the betrayal of Kobayakawa Hideaki and others of the Western Army. Therefore, when making a game, the elements of the politicking for the army of Kobayakawa Hideaki and others are usually included. However, this was an element that was prone to system problems, such as complicating the game system and allowing players who know the historical facts of betrayal to take measures against betrayal in advance.<br/>Therefore, this game focused on &quot;the salvo of guns on Mt. Matsuo by the Ieyasu main corps&quot; that triggered Kobayakawa Hideaki to finally implement the betrayal. The game defines that Ieyasu gets impatient and starts advancing = betrayal = defeat of the Western Army, and sets the victory condition that the Western Army is defeated if the victory or defeat is not decided &quot;until the Ieyasu main corps starts advancing&quot;.<br/>This is a fairly high hurdle for the Western Army, but it is a victory condition unique to solitaire that you can challenge as many times as you want without having to secure an opponent.

        "description": "Winds of Caribbean is a naval battle-themed game of sailing ships during the Age of Discovery, based on the system of the masterpiece Wings of War: Dawn of War. Players control sailboats, shoot cannons, and sometimes come alongside to fight and aim for victory.<br/>The big difference between Wings of War and Winds of Caribbean is that the former has the same direction of movement and attack, while the later has different directions of movement and attack. The theory of naval battles during the age of sail was to face the enemy on the side where the cannons were lined up, and this game also reproduced that. You can experience a different battle from the air battle, such as how to switch between movement and attack. In addition, the cannon reflects the performance of the time, it requires loading of bullets for each attack and the rapid fire does not work, and if the ship moves violently, the hit rate will drop or it will not be possible to load. It also includes the element that if a fire breaks out due to being hit, the fire must be extinguished. When ships collide with each other, side-to-side battle (aboldage) also occurs. Some ships are better at this, so pirate style is also possible.<br/>The feature of the component is that the display such as loading of bullets and decrease of hit rate is set to &quot;character + lines&quot;. It is also an expression that the commander's ability and command occupy a large weight in the naval battle at that time.<br/>There are three types of ships: caravel, carrack, and small galleon.<br/><br/>",

This PR plan includes making subordinates public relations idols, and it is important for players how to make their idols active.<br/><br/>The outcome of the game is determined by the total number of PR points earned at the end of the game.

There are 24 types of projects, and the points and contents are different, but a &quot;budget&quot; is required to compete for these, and the speed at which these budgets can be recovered depends on the abilities of each idol. If you spend a lot of time collecting your budget, no matter how big a project you get, you may lose to another company that has more projects.<br/><br/>In addition, some projects may have synergistic effects with other projects, and some may affect subsequent activities. For example, the &quot;manner training&quot; card has 0 PR points, but it has the effect of improving the &quot;social&quot; ability.

        "description": "Coral Sea Decisive Battle Card Game is a two-player card game with the motif of the first aircraft carrier-to-aircraft carrier confrontation that took place in 1942 during the Pacific War. Players will fight in the position of commander of the Japanese task force centered on the aircraft carriers Zuikaku and Shokaku, or the commander of the US task force centered on the aircraft carriers Lexington and Yorktown.<br/><br/>Battles between aircraft carriers include elements such as searching for enemy locations, air defense plans, and the formation and rotation of attack units. While covering these elements, I tried to reproduce the air and naval battle at that time with a system that was as simple as possible like a card game. The game also includes the presence of friendly forces, geographical advantages, and technical differences such as radar.<br/>Especially the search for enemy is the heart of this game. By repeating the search for enemy, the location of the enemy will gradually be narrowed down, but it is the same for the opponent. It's better to find the enemy early, but you also have to think about defense. You will feel the excitement because you do not know the movement of the opponent.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Senryaku-Daimyo is a board game for 3 to 4 players who aims to prosper in their own country by taking the position of a daimyo during the Sengoku period.<br/><br/>When you think of a game during the Sengoku period, you might think of a battle for territory without humanity and justice, but this &quot;Senryaku-Daimyo&quot; includes not only &quot;battle&quot; but also territorial management elements such as commerce and industrial development. You can enjoy the trade-in that suits your style.<br/><br/>The starting line at the start of the game is the same for all players. The number of territories, economic power, and human assets are the same. From there, players will continue to prosper their country while acquiring cards for their policies and territories. You may focus on industrial development such as &quot;hydraulic control&quot; and &quot;land survey&quot;, or you may focus on commercial promotion such as &quot;free trade&quot; and &quot;money casting&quot;. Of course, you may expand your territory and make your country bigger by the battle unique to the Sengoku period. Ultimately, who enriched the country the most is determined by the total number of victory points on those cards, so it's completely up to you what direction you're aiming for.<br/><br/>Of course, among the routes mentioned above, the expansion of the territory has a great deal of economic gain, which greatly contributes to victory. However, the act of relying on force is not unrelated to the interference of other countries. In addition, events such as storms and floods and riots occur suddenly, so territorial management does not go as planned. Sometimes it will be necessary to make bold use of human resources during the Sengoku period.<br/><br/>Is it possible to outsmart the speculation of other countries and build the richest country in Japan?<br/><br/>",

However, cat cards have various effects, such as drawing cards from the deck, forcing other players to exchange cards, and pressing unwanted cards. Occasionally, there will be a &quot;power comparison&quot; where you can get a card by comparing the strength of the cat and winning! When the deck runs out, the game ends, and the victory or defeat is determined by the total points written on the fish card at that time.<br/><br/>The feature of this game is that everyone starts the game with the same number of fish cards. Some fish cards range from high scores to negative points, and it is unknown who started the game with how many points.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, you will gradually see who is best to play against and who is best to exchange cards with. It is a card game that children and adults can easily play, guessing in the hands of other players and bargaining which card to leave last.<br/><br/>",

Ekiden, long distance road racing, is a very popular sport in Japan, and the Hakone Ekiden is notoriously hard, with five legs run from central Tokyo out to Hakone on day one, and then five legs run back to central Tokyo on day two. Each leg is over 20km, and the race is run by teams of university students.<br/><br/>In the dice game Hakone, players are coaching their university team to win the Hakone Ekiden. Each leg is run by different athletes, and the coach must select the best one to suit the stage. The athlete cards show their abilities, their time over 10k, how they do at climbing or descending, against the wind or sea breezes. In addition, the players use special action cards to improve their performance, or nobble the opposition.<br/><br/>The dice are used as in CATAN, with one dice roll applying to all runners. The courses are printed on cloths and there are eight university teams to choose from.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Frogs are at war, and both armies face off in a battle.<br/><br/>Both players draw from a single deck, which has only 16 cards, and play (summon) frog cards face-down or face-up on their playmat. The frogs have values for attack and defence, and if an attacking frog has a higher attack than the opponent's defence value, it wins.<br/><br/>Cards are either played up as attack cards, and immediately attack, or sideways as defence cards. Cards played face down do not have to be revealed until attacked.<br/><br/>Some of the frogs have special abilities, which are triggered immediately they make an attack. For example, a Knight can switch the mode of one of the opponent's summoned Frogs from ATTACK to DEFENSE, and vice versa.<br/><br/>Each player has ten hit points at the start, and if an attack penetrates the defence, the player loses hit points. Crucially, if the deck is exhausted, the player with the fewest hit points wins. But if the deck is still in play, the player at zero hit points first loses.<br/><br/>The game is published in a Black edition and a White edition, with different frog armies with different strengths and special abilities.<br/><br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Toons And Towers is a card game that is loosely connected to a web comic series. The game involves two players who compete to try to drop their opponent's points to 0 before the end of the agreed time limit. Both players start a game with 80,000 points. Each player will have a deck of 50 cards consisting of cartoon, upgrade, and counter cards.<br/><br/>Both players start the game by drawing five cards from the top of their deck of cards. Each turn is broken into seven steps where players attack and defend aginst each other.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of two things are achieved; a player has been eliminated or the agreed time limit has been reached.<br/><br/>A player wins by successfully attacking his opponent's side of the field until they have reduced their opponent's points down to zero. This can also be achieved by having more remaining points than your opponent by the end of the agreed time limit.<br/><br/>",

After years of intensive, secret research, edible species from Aotearoa and all over the world finally flourish year-round in the Valley, a forager's paradise in a climate-controlled biodome.<br/><br/>You are a Cottager, leading your team of Gatherers to forage for harvest goods, learn your craft from local Artisans, and craft the best recipes to sell to your customers. Move around the modular hex tile Valley, choosing from actions to harvest, make recipes, visit Artisans, complete Goals, and get those sales. Choose recipes from a river of cards that include good and bad event cards - play the standard game or add the Spice cards for increased complexity - but take care, as every card drawn can precipitate Nightfall, the end of the day, where the board resets, the overnight growth cycle restocks the resource tiles, and all Gatherers return to the Cottage with their laden baskets.<br/><br/>The game ends when the Recipe cards run out and the final Night falls. After you have added your Goal points to your recipe card values, the player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>The Valley is very flexible - with 2 to 6 players, and gameplay from 20 minutes to several hours, you can play a quick game by ending the game on the first or second Nightfall card, or play with up to 6 rounds, each ending in a Night. You can also control the complexity by adding in Spicy Recipes, Event cards, Goals, and by using your Cottager abilities.<br/><br/>The Valley is set in New Zealand, so it also features recipe ingredients and cultural terms which only apply in Aotearoa. While these are covered briefly in the Glossary, we encourage you to jump down that rabbithole and learn more about this beautiful country!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stowe evolves the game of Chess to a new level by allowing a player's pieces to stack on top of each other through any legal Chess move. As stacks grow, each one may move like the normal movement of the top piece or may use a secondary movement ability determined by the height of the stack. Each piece has a number on it that corresponds to the height stack needed to use its movement ability. Stacked pieces can unstack, but only one at a time and can only move like the piece unstacking.<br/><br/>Turn Overview: On a players turn, they may move any one of their 16 pieces according to traditional Chess piece movements. A player may use any of these movements to stack one or more pieces on top of another. If a stack of pieces already exists, a player may unstack the top piece according to it's Chess movement ability. Only one piece can unstack at a time. After a player makes one move, play proceeds to the next player.<br/><br/>Like traditional Chess the game ends when one player Wins by capturing their opponent's King, or results in a Stalemate if no players posses the ability to capture their opponents King.<br/><br/>Other variants of play include: <br/>  Minimizing the board to 3 or 5 lanes, and following the recommended setup.<br/>  Using the Stowe Backgammon Dice to have players moves be determined by rolling a dice.<br/>  In Wild West Chess players simply stack on top of opponents  when capturing pieces. If de-stacked opponents gain back control of their piece(s).<br/> ",

There are 5 additional Kiddie Quiz cards included in this set.<br/><br/>Players select a quiz board to use and answer trivia questions. Right answers are indicated by the quiz board lights.<br/><br/>To play, hold one selector tip in your left hand and place it on a contact station, or question. With the card above, we will select &lsquo;Life Boat&rsquo; in the upper left corner. Then, holding the other selector tip in your right hand, place it on another contact station, or answer.<br/><br/>In this case, it would be the metal disk just below &lsquo;Anchor&rsquo; on the upper side of the Nautilus, between the Vertical Fin and the Rudder &amp; Propeller. When you have made this final contact, the circuit is completed and the red light will glow to indicate a correct answer. If you were to place the selector tip in your right hand on the wrong metal disc, say in the lower left corner by the Anchor, nothing would happen, and you would have given a wrong answer. Play would then pass to the next player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Teleported to a new world, the Players find mounts and gain the ability to ride them, causing them to become Riders. Riders move their Mount Pieces space to space on tiles based on the roll of a d4, discovering more of the world as they do by setting new tiles when they reach the end of a tile. Riders take different actions depending on the type of space that is landed on when they run out of movement. These actions cause you to gain items, equipment or spells, meet interesting characters, participate in wacky events, or fight Akuwu which are the monsters of the land in order to either Liberate towns or remove them from the road. When fighting Akuwu, Riders use their equipped equipment and miscellaneous items and spells to attempt to have more Kapow than the Akuwu they are fighting, rolling dice when necessary to raise Kapow by the roll, in order to defeat them and gain rewards that add to the Riders worth. Riders have 16 turns to gain the most worth before the final Boss appears, whether it be in the form of pure Gilver obtained throughout the game or assets such as items, equipment, spells and Liberated Towns that are automatically sold at the end of the game. The Riders must defeat the boss, either together or on their own to reap the rewards or else face the consequences of failure.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ahoy privateer! A hurricane the likes of which ye&rsquo;ve never seen is bearing down on Doubloon Lagoon, the site of the lost wreck of the treasure-teeming megaship, The Dorado. Rumors have it that the storm is shaking the booty free of the clutches of the reefs, and rife for the taking. However, ye not be the only pirates in these parts, and the hurricane winds are filling sails, me hearty. So get all hands on deck and beat those bilge rats to the treasure, or send them to the briney deep.<br/><br/>This is a grid-based, pirate-themed, battle royale sailing game that uses mechanics such as wind direction, dice battling, and movement economy to race and battle your friends to be the last ship afloat with the most treasure aboard when the storm hits. You command 3 ships; a slow and heavily armored/gunned Galleon, a balanced Brigantine, and a weak yet fast Sloop. Each of these ships have different attributes in regards to bonuses they receive in movement, cannon power, and defenses.<br/><br/>Rather than chess-style movement, each turn the wind will (or may not) change direction, effecting all of the ships ability to sail on certain headings. Learn the actual points of sail used by sailers to maximize your movement and chart the best course to play the wind and best your opponents.<br/><br/>Each turn, a randomly generated chest of treasure will surface somewhere in the play area, creating an ever shifting goal for you while you fend off other players and dodge cannon fire. Win the game by being the last one afloat with most treasure when the turn-based timer runs out and the hurricane hits. Randomly generated wind, treasure locations, unnavigable-island tiles, and up to 8 players make for different play styles and outcomes with every session.<br/><br/>",

On their turn, they will roll a die dictating which department they must draw from and place within the confines of their bag. You may exceed out of the &quot;top&quot; of your bag, but when you do so you risk dropping items or worse, the dreaded &quot;bag rip.&quot;<br/><br/>At their discretion, players may draw another bag card from a pile (aka bags just in your car) to create more space to carry more items into the house. These bags have different dimensions - such as a convenience store bag, wine shop bag, clothing store bags, recycled totes, and more.<br/><br/>Scoring is resolved at the end of the game by totaling the scores indicated on each of the food items that you successfully brought to the house, dividing by the number of bags you used, and subtracting the scores of any of the food items that were dropped or suffered a bag rip.<br/><br/>",

Two players take over the positions of the signalmen and handle the closing and opening of the railway barriers. One party starts at C, the other at D. The players take turns rolling the die and moving. After the first throw has fallen, the work of the signalmen begins. If a straight throw (2, 4, 6) has been thrown, the strip representing the railway  is positioned on II, if odd (1, 3 , 5) is thrown, it is on I. This is to be done after each throw, and this will alternately block the blue stripe representing the country road. If the railway crossing is closed, the players have to stop till it opens again.<br/><br/>E-F presents a bridge on which 2 cars cannot drive side by side. If a player comes to the bridge and this is occupied by an oncoming car, he has to wait at E or F until the bridge is free. Also, no player can overtake a car moving in the same direction, but must occupy the next space behind it.<br/><br/>If two oncoming cars come to a stop on the same space on the road, this means a collision. The two players then have to roll the dice together. The lower throw is eliminated from the game, the other moves back 10 spaces.<br/><br/>Whoever reaches the opposite end of the lane first gets half the contents of the till and his party a point, and for each additional car that arrives earlier than the first car of the other party, another point. The first winner of the opposing party receives a quarter of the contents of the till. The last quarter remains in the till. The game is repeated until one party has 30 points.

Stated to be a traditional folk game with rules handed down in the family, when marketed online, but it appears not to have been previously recorded.<br/><br/>Played on a square wooden board, divided into 7&times;7 undifferentiated squares (the game can also be played on an 8&times;8 chess board).<br/><br/>One player takes 6 light / natural coloured discs, termed ravens, and sets them up in one corner of the board, one in the very corner, another in each of the adjacent squares, and the remaining three in the squares adjacent to those.  The opponent takes six dark / stained discs, and similarly sets them up in the opposite corner.  Each player's specially marked disc, termed Odin's Raven, is placed at the head of this flock.  Players then take turns in moving one of their ravens, with the aim of winning the game by capturing all of the opposing ravens.<br/>Odin's raven moves like a knight in chess, and captures by landing on an opposing disc. Other ravens move like chess rooks, and capture by flanking an opposing disc, as in hnefatafl.  Odin's raven may also participate in these flanking captures.<br/>There are several slight variants with differing movement / capturing rules.<br/><br/>",

It is based on a unique relationship that exists between some words called a Word Pyramid.<br/><br/>The word 'Pyramid' can be used to illustrate the concept of a Word Pyramid. When P is removed from the pyramid the remaining letters are rearranged to form MYRIAD. When M is removed from myriad the remaining letters are used to form the words DAIRY and DIARY. By removing I, R and D in succession the words YARD, DAY, and AY are formed respectively. See box cover.<br/><br/>Players must determine words from definitions and other related clues given. Players must solve a series of unrelated words and from one to four word pyramids.<br/><br/>Before the game begins, Players decide how many word pyramids each player will solve and how many of them are to be solved starting with the smallest word and how many with the largest word.<br/><br/>When one or two word pyramids are to be solved by each player, one revolution of the perimeter must be made. When three to four word pyramids are to be solved by each player, two revolutions of the perimeter must be made.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the first player who completes the required number of revolutions of the perimeter and solves the required number of word pyramids.<br/><br/>",

This story of expansion and decline is the inspiration for these wargames' rules.<br/><br/>Designed for ease of play, Three Ages of Rome offers a player experience based on the commander&rsquo;s problems. The rules are designed to create a feel for the uncertainty of ancient battles. Most games should take 2-3 hours to play.  No rebasing required, can be played with all current basing styles and conventions.<br/><br/>Keeping your men going, even when things don't seem too good, is critical for success. Units are likely to become progressively disabled and cohesion begins to suffer. If commanders don&rsquo;t take care to maintain cohesion, then they could be heading for disaster!<br/><br/>The six historical battle scenarios span the Three Ages and provide different challenges. They offer players an insight into the nature of command in ancient warfare. The Terrain Generator and Scenario Generator allow the players to develop their own games. For competitive games, a system of points gives players all the information needed to exactly balance their forces.<br/><br/>In battle nothing is certain but generals that practice their skills are more likely to be victorious.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Countries and global corporations are growing desperate and have taken to the outer planets for a new source of energy to replace our dwindling reserves. A deep space probe discovers a new rare element in the lower troposphere of Jupiter which scientists name Exonium. This element will provide significant relief to the energy crisis on Earth. <br/>In a move to beat its competitors, the Power Dynamics Corporation (PDC) has decided to take matters into its own hands. PDC has built a large carrier spacecraft containing four drop ships and sufficient resources to initiate development of stations on four of the moons of Jupiter, Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto.<br/><br/>You and your fellow PDC teammates will serve as the Commanders of these moon stations. You will each strive to establish a base camp, build the necessary production facilities, and become self-sufficient all the while working with your fellow commanders to get the Orbital Platform running at full strength. The environment around Jupiter is an extremely hostile one. Radiation, magnetic storms, moon quakes, and uncounted quantities of small debris rain down on every moon within the Jovian system. Life on an inhospitable foreign moon can be dangerous, but if the human race is to survive, failure is not an option&hellip;&hellip;.<br/><br/>Welcome to In the Shadow of Jupiter, a strategic co-op game where you and your fellow PDC colleagues will strive to build stations on the different moons of Jupiter and survive against the dangers of space long enough to complete construction on the orbital mining platform. You are up against the clock, you can only last for so long before running out of supplies!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ideal for family play and easy to play alone between childhoods. Between 2 cards&hellip; Which image is repeated??? mmmm&hellip; I ALREADY SAW IT!<br/><br/>You have to say it quickly, as soon as you found the match. The more attention you have, the easier you will see them! Hurry up, concentrate, wake up because in this game, speed rushes us and fun awaits us. If you take two cards and look closely, you will see that they always have one image in common (one and only one). So the goal of the game (in its 5 variants) is to find that common image between two cards and name them as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>1- Pile, Pile with challenges!<br/>A card with images is distributed to each participant and the rest are placed in a pile in the center, with the images visible. You must look for the common image between the card that touched you and the first of the stack. Whoever names the match first draws the center card and places it on top of their own pile. when a challenge card appears, whoever meets it first wins the indicated cards. The game ends when there are no more cards in the center of the table and whoever collects the most cards wins.<br/><br/>2- Discard with challenges!<br/>Opposite of &quot;Stack, stack&quot;: a card is placed in the center of the table and the rest are distributed among those who play. Each participant has to find the common image between the card that is on the table and the first of their stack. When the match is found, it quickly drops it on the table, discarding itself. Whoever runs out of cards first wins. In this variant they also play the 4 challenge cards, each time a participant reveals one of these cards, they must read it aloud to the rest... So everyone participates!<br/><br/>3- The jersey (without challenges)<br/>In the center of the table 9 cards are placed face up. The jersey is assembled by finding the same image on three different cards. Whoever forms them first and names the image that matches, takes all three cards (which must be replaced so that there are always 9 cards on the table). Once the cards are finished, whoever collected the most wins.<br/><br/>4- Take it yourself! (no challenges)<br/>Each participant receives a card face down. The remaining cards are placed in a stack face up in the center of the table. Each participant has to find the common image between the card of the center and that of any participant (except their own). When the match is found, give the center card to whoever has the card with the match. Whoever keeps the most cards loses.<br/><br/>5- Pass it fast! (no challenges)<br/>Each participant puts a card on the palm of his hand, in view of the rest. When someone finds the image in common between one card and another, he puts his own card on the matching card. Here nobody wins, but whoever keeps all the cards at the end loses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Conquest&rdquo; dates back to the 19th century and is one of the many games inspired by Checkers and Chess and which are also inspired by real historical episodes, such as battles, sieges, military events; among these games we remember &ldquo;Asalto&rdquo;, &ldquo;Assault&rdquo; and &ldquo;Siege of Paris&rdquo;. The game is developed on a 9x9 chessboard; each player has eight Soldiers and a King, initially arranged in the 3x3 lower right and upper left areas; the King is placed in the center of these areas and is completely surrounded by the eight Soldiers. The goal of the game is to conquer the Fortress, which is the 3x3 area in the center of the game board. <br/>Information on this game is not readily available: it is mentioned in &ldquo;Il Grande Manuale dei Giochi da Tavolo&rdquo; by Giuseppe Meroni and Aldo Spinelli (1996).<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to form your own band (singer, guitarist, bassist, drummer), but watch out for other players: they will have the same goal as you! Opponents will be able to get in your way with fierce Groupies, Producers ready for anything and unscrupulous Head Hunters. Don't worry, though: your Bodyguards will protect you from any malicious player.<br/><br/>Draw from the main deck and play as many cards as you want. The cards you play go into your personal discard pile, called the backstage pile. If you draw an event you skip the turn and suffer (or all players suffer) the effects of the event. Events discard onto a common discard pile and cannot be owned by players. You must have a maximum of 4 cards in your hand to end your turn. If you have more, you can discard the excess cards to the backstage (without using them) and pass the turn. The first to form a complete band wins!<br/><br/>",

Participants are racing to be the first ones to reach the bottom hill. Alternatively, players can attempt to catch the 9-pound double Gloucester cheese as they race down the hill to be instantly victorious.<br/><br/>Cooper's Hill is a write and roll game where layers simultaneously will write a number between 1 and 20 and then reveal at the same time. Writing the highest number will grant the player with the fastest speed but will also make them more likely to take a injury. Based on the number you wrote and how you move on the hill you will roll dice indicating what kind of injuries you sustain.<br/><br/>Attempt to push you luck just enough to avoid being eliminated while still reaching the bottom the fastest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You command an army of stag beetles. They are fighting each other on a cloven oak tree. The winner takes the ultimate delicacy &ndash; the oozing sap. The rules are simple, yet the tactical and strategic approaches are nearly endless. The goal is to get three of your stag beetles to the opponent's front row first. To get there, you'll need to push the enemy bugs off onto other branches, crush them, and drop them from the tree.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 10 x 10 square board. You can use two or three beetles to displace one or two enemy beetles in columns and in rows. But watch out! Diagonal push moves are mandatory. Even if you don&rsquo;t like the direction! It will often be convenient for you to let your opponent push your stag beetles out during the game as this will weaken their position. And you can use these weaknesses to your advantage.<br/><br/>Some weaknesses can become strengths during the game. It works both ways. In the beginning of a game, it is generally good to keep a lot of stag beetles in diagonals. However, the more you move into your opponent's territory, the more you must be vigilant that they don't take advantage of your diagonals. For instance, they could place their beetles behind yours just to make you push them towards your front row.<br/><br/>A popular tactic is to sacrifice some of your stag beetles by letting them fall off the tree or be crushed. This destabilizes your opponent's position, and you can easily sneak this move in. You can also let your opponent reach your first row with two of their beetles. By doing this, you gain a positional advantage. You can quickly place three of your beetles on the enemy's first rowg and win. The game is very dynamic. A position that may seem wrong can quickly turn everything around and let you win. You just need to find the right way.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stratospharenflug is a German board game produced to celebrate the first human accent into the Stratosphere On 27 May 1931 by Auguste Piccard and Paul Kipfer<br/><br/>The game is a simple roll and move in both a horizontal and vertical directions. The game board has a grid overlaying a landscape with red and blue numbers along the Y and X- axis (similar to the game Battleship). The dice is marked on three sides with red numbers (1 to 3) and the other sides marked with blue numbers (1 to 3). <br/>Players start at the bottom taking turns. If the dice shows a red number, a player ascends vertically, if it shows a blue number, then the player moves to the right into the landscape. Depending on the coloured numbers on the dice, players will ascend and travel right across the board. Once a player ascends to red 16 they are at the highest altitude and can go no higher. If a player has already reached red 16 and rolls red again, they must miss a turn. <br/>To win the game the players in turn continue to roll the dice for a blue number and move to the right. This is continued until number Blue 30 and Red 16 is reached (top right corner). Whoever reaches this number first is deemed the winner.<br/>One space on the game board shows a meteor (Red 9 - Blue 18). If a player lands on this square the player is out of the game, because his balloon burns as a result of being struck by the meteor.<br/><br/>The game celebrates a milestone in human endeavor. The front box shows the yellow balloon and black and silver capsule that Piccard and his assistant used in 1931. They were the first people to visually observe the curvature of the earth.<br/><br/>Of interest to other board games, Auguste Piccard was the inspiration for Professor Calculus in The Adventures of Tintin and Captain Jean-Luc Picard in Star Trek was named after one or both of the twin brothers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is inspired by the Etruscan divination art and is an interpretation of how dice could have been used more than 2500 years ago. <br/>The Netsvis board reproduces the sacred Etruscan space and can be used both alone, to draw the wishes of the day, and in competition with other players, having as its objective the challenge to Fate with the simple throw of the dice.<br/>How to play.<br/><br/>     Netsvis is a solitaire where you face pure destiny, destiny and what governs all the daily events behind it. It can be used as a divination tool (do I win or does Fate win?) But it is also a competitive pastime towards oneself. In fact, it is possible to numerically evaluate the outcome of the single game and gradually try to obtain better and better results. In this way it is also possible to compete with the participation of more players in succession of time.<br/>     The two dice act alternately as dice and checkers. The white die W is favorable, the one that could win. The black die B is the unfavorable one, the one that could make you lose.<br/>     At the start of the game, B is placed in the gray box in the lower center. It doesn't matter what value is shown on the top face of him.<br/>     You roll W with your right hand and, starting from the square occupied by B, advance it to the right to the first square that shows the same image of the face that came out in the roll of the dice. Here the die W stops while B remains in his place.<br/>     Now take B and throw it with your left hand. The result of the shot causes B to move to the first square corresponding to the exit face, starting from the position of W but in the opposite direction, ie to the left. Now two clarifications are necessary. The first, completely connected to superstition, is linked to the traditional beneficial influence of the right hand (which must be used to roll the white dice) while the left has always been considered a bearer of misfortune. The second clarification is fundamental for the purposes of the game. When the rule says: &quot;Bring B into the first square on the left starting from the one occupied by W&quot; it means that a possible release of the colors magenta, yellow or blue in this first throw of B will make it move to the right with respect to its initial position but &quot; however &quot;to the left of the white die.<br/>     After placing B in the corresponding square, W is taken from the square in which it is and raised (with the right hand) and then moved to the right up to the first square equal to the exit face. Also in this case the reference to the starting point of the displacement of W is the square in which B stands.<br/>     And so on, toss after toss in a continuous back and forth that leads W to the right arm of the board and brings B back to the left. The game continues until one of the two dice cannot move because it is in such a position that there is no square in front of it with the symbol that came out in that roll. If it is W, it is placed on the top white square and the player has won.<br/>     If it is B, it is moved to the top black box and the player has lost. So it's fate that won the game!<br/>     You can only win with an odd number of rolls and lose with an even number. This distinction also has its own symbolic meaning ... And you can win with a few moves or after a tiring sequence of rolling the two dice. Likewise, if Fate is adverse, a few moves may be enough to reach the nefarious black box. If you manage to stall, you must never lose hope: the arrangement of the numbers on the board can often turn the tables in our favor.<br/><br/><br/>",
