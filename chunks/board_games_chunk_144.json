Woody Woodpecker may move in any direction, the hunters may only move forward. They are only allowed to use the blue dots if they are on a rectangular blue space and roll a 1 or a 6. If a hunter player catches Woody Woodpecker, he gets a chip and  changes the roles with the Woody Woodpecker player.

In the improvised arena that uses city streets, the champions of the two most feared urban gangs, the Wheels of Judgment and the Gods of Atomic Speed, face off. During the race, the two drivers try to put the opposing motorcycle at gunpoint using the light tracer. Who at the end of the race will have scored more tracers on the other bike will be the winner!<br/><br/>To move his motorcycle, the player plays one of his numbered cards. At the end of the turn, a tracer can also play in the space provided. If a player plays a card to move, the value of which is equal to that of a tracer already played, this tracer is activated and the motorcycle behind (to understand who it is, you need to determine the shorter arc that separates the two motorcycles) can shoot, taking by the tracer card. On the tracer cards there are the symbols of the hits, whoever has collected the most hits at the end of the race wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Recommended sizes are between 7x7 and 10x10 spaces. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones of their own color.<br/><br/>An empty space is controlled by the player with more stones adjacent to it. Diagonal adjacencies also count. A space occupied by a stone is controlled by the owner of that stone.<br/><br/>Red plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, you must place a stone of your color on a empty space that is not controlled by either player.<br/><br/>The game ends when no more placements are possible. The player who controls more spaces in the final position wins.<br/><br/>According to the designer, this game, later reworked into Kuzushi, suffers from a huge first-player advantage. It is suggested to use komi (compensation points for the second player) to solve this issue.<br/><br/>",

The TelePizza promotional version (released as a marketing campaign for the large Spanish pizza chain, co-sponsored by Coca-Cola) had a smaller, rectangular board, with 9 spaces on the longer sides and 7 spaces on the shorter sides. Instead of the standard version's streets of Madrid, the properties in this version are city names from throughout Spain, as well as TelePizza factory locations and methods of delivery transportation. The currency was redesigned to feature a pizza chef silhouette in the middle, and says it is from &quot;Banco Telepizza&quot;. The Suerte (Luck) cards have the TelePizza logo on the back, and the Sorpresa (Surprise) cards have the Coca-Cola logo on the back.<br/><br/>",

But watch out for fighters, cruisers, battle stations and asteroids. Can also be played by 2 players, with one player replacing the AI.<br/><br/>You will need:<br/>This rule set<br/>2 pages of Command Cards and counters (14 cards, 17 counters)<br/>4 hex map pages (or you can use any printed one-inch hex map)<br/>1 6d<br/>colored beads or cubes as markers<br/><br/>In 2-player play, both fleets should be chosen so that their total number of Shield points, added together, is roughly equal. For solo play, give the AI side a 25-50% advantage. Solitaire players can play either fleet, and use the AI system to determine the opponent&rsquo;s movements.<br/><br/>For small fleets with no more than 2 or 3 ships per side, two Hex Map boards should provide sufficient space. Larger fleets may require all four Hex Map boards for sufficient room.<br/><br/>Each turn, the Players move the ships in their fleet. In solo play, an AI dice table determines the opponent's moves. Ships maneuver to get within firing range of their opponent's ships. Combat is resolved by dice throw.<br/><br/>The difficulty level of Star Battle 2275 AD can be adjusted by varying the number and type of ships in each fleet. The game can also be made more difficult by adding navigational hazards such as Asteroids, which block line of sight and prevent travel within the hexes they cover.<br/><br/>Players win by destroying the opponent fleet.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Mortimer as a commission for Cooper Tires as a promotional item in the line of their Ambassador David Coulthard merchandise.<br/><br/>A game is played over rounds until one player ends their turn with both their cards in front of DC. At the start of a round DC moves at his current speed, which will change during the game.<br/><br/>Each player in turn order then performs their turn by rolling 3 dice, they must pick 1 dice for each car and then the third is used as a special tactic for one car to slip stream from a distance, overtake a car in front, nail the corners this move or to collect tactic cubes depending on what has been rolled. Tactic cubes let players manipulate the rolls on future turns. At the end of a turn the players cars will cruise up behind a car in front of them.<br/><br/>Managing these rolls and the numbers used for cars verses tactics is critical to success because if you enter a corner too fast you'll skid to a halt and lose your momentum and if you can get ne of your cars to punch a hole in the air for their team mate you speed will increase.<br/><br/>A game quick enough that you can learn to play and finish a game whilst your tires are fitted!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This is a new method that adds some goals to a standard mission.<br/><br/>The three levels are Normal, Heroic and Master.<br/><br/><br/>     Normal Level:- Is the base mission. This has already been described above.<br/>     Heroic Level:- Has the same basic outline of the Normal Mission but now the players will need to harvest the Saplings before the harsh environment of the badlands kills the plants.<br/>     Master Level:- Taking Normal and Heroic levels. With the added bonus of getting the 'Harvest Saplings' of the game table in a certain amount of ACTIONS.<br/><br/><br/>Each 'Level' offers new and existing OUTLAND Players a different challenge. Of course the rewards for completing each 'Level' have been increased to match the mission type.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each character comes in their own Coin Deck.<br/><br/>A Coin Deck contains a coin, display stand, dice, and 108 cards themed to that character.<br/><br/>There is no shuffling or drawing cards. Players use the cards to build their character based on their vision of that character and strategy for the game.  A character can be customized to various power levels in the areas of Attack, Defense, Damage Bonus, Resistance, Health, Power, and Ability Cards.<br/><br/>There are over 50 unique Ability cards.  Players secretly choose a set number of Ability cards before the game. These are kept in a player's hand and only shown when used.  Most Ability cards require a specific amount of Power cards.<br/><br/>During a player's turn, they can choose to Activate a Character, Rest a Character, or Use a Card. Most cards result in a battle with another character. Some cards have other effects.<br/><br/>A player must protect their Health cards and manage their Power cards while attacking and defending against an enemy.  Many attacks are resolved by opposing dice rolls. However, other attacks/defenses are countered by your opponent's cards.<br/><br/>There is no board. The coin is placed on its display stand in front of the player.  The cards are placed next to the coin.<br/><br/>There is no limit to the number of players.  You can play in teams, a handicapped game, or other game modes.<br/><br/>Game balance is maintained since each deck has cards with the same abilities.  However, they are themed to fit the character.  An evasion defense may be called Flight for a Dragon but Teleportation for a Lich.<br/><br/>Every card has a counter.  More powerful cards cost more to use.  You can only use an Ability card once.  These things prevent one or two cards from dominating the game.<br/><br/>When not playing, coins can be used as display pieces since they come with a stand.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

On their turn each player moves one of their pieces to an adjacent space, or captures an opposing piece on an adjacent space.<br/><br/>The board is a tessellation of 188 triangles, and the unique factor of the game is that each space of the board is coloured one of five colors (red, orange, yellow, green, purple) and each piece can only enter three of the five colors.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is now 2026 post corona and mutants roam freely and you are the last of humanity&rsquo;s remnants. You and your followers fight to escape the planet by any means necessary. Compete against other<br/>factions in a race for resources, weapons and to be the only one to escape in a colonization ship.<br/><br/>Components<br/>â    DNA Deck- These cards come in 4 values and 2 different colors(back). 2,3,4 and 5. The 2 and 5 pieces have red backs, while the 3 and 4 pieces have greenbacks.  Collecting these cards will help solve the molecular DNA crisis and create a cure for the COVID-Z21 virus. When any player accumulates a sum of 10 or more DNA, then the game can be won!<br/>â    Schematics Cards (52 card Deck) - Rare cards that will allow a faction to create a spaceship to escape the planet. Collect 15 schematics in order to win the game by leaving the rest of humanity behind in order to colonize the stars. Only 7 of these cards exist in the entire game!<br/>â    Survivor Deck - A deck of cards that have survivors in them. Each survivor has a unique ability which will improve your chances at surviving the epidemic. When all survivors are gone, game over! <br/>â    Tools Deck - This deck holds items and tools that can be used to survive the Zombie Plague. This includes weapons, defense tools , resources , med kits and more.<br/>â    Threat Deck - Cards which feature various zombie threats and humanoid threats courtesy of the Illuminati. Defeat zombies to harvest valuable DNA, while you must contend with illuminati threats to survive!<br/><br/>Set Up<br/><br/>â    Determine turn order amongst yourselves.<br/>â    Each deck should be shuffled well before the game begins. <br/>â    Deal 5 cards from the Survivor deck to each player. In turn, each player should place their Survivor cards face up in front of them.<br/>â    Add the Schematics cards to the Tools Deck as well as the remainder of the Survivor Deck. Shuffle the new Tool Deck well.<br/>â    Each player should also now be dealt 3 cards from the Tools Deck. Place the remaining Tool Deck cards face down in the center of the play area.<br/>â    Place all of the remaining decks (Tool and Threat Decks) face down in the center of the playing area.<br/><br/>With this the game is ready to begin!<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to collect a sum of 10 schematic cards, the first to do this wins. Players can choose to help or hinder each other during this process.<br/><br/>Alternatively, if any player manages to collect 20, DNA cards and to sacrifice 5 cards, the game will end!<br/><br/>You lose if:<br/>1.    Another player collects a sum of 20 or greater DNA material.<br/>2.    A player collects 10 schematics cards to complete the process of building an escape ship.<br/>3.    You lose all survivors in your faction.<br/><br/>Collecting DNA Cards<br/>Perhaps the easiest way to win is to collect DNA cards. Each has a value listed on it which denotes the value of the DNA within. Collect a sum of 20 or more to win. This can be done in four ways:<br/><br/>â    You can defeat a zombie to collect 1 DNA card.<br/>â    You can obtain them through bartering with other factions (players).<br/>â    You can steal or syphon them from other players.<br/><br/>Turns and Turn Actions<br/><br/>Each player has several actions they can take during a turn. These determine how the game progresses and are listed below:<br/><br/>1.    Place a card in play. This varies based on type of card, but generally there are no limits to the amount of cards you can have / place in play throughout the duration of a game or in a single turn.<br/><br/>The exception to this is Survivor cards, of which you can only have a maximum of 10.<br/>2.    Draw a Threat card. This must be done every turn. You will either need to resolve your battle or you will have the freedom to take one or more other actions. [See Battle Resolution]<br/>3.    Sacrifice 2 cards to draw from the DNA Deck.<br/>4.    Sacrifice 2 cards to draw from the Tools Deck.<br/><br/>Of these four potential actions, #1 and #4 have no limitation on the number of times they can be performed during a turn. #2 and #3 can only be performed once per turn.<br/><br/>Finally, the player must make sure they have no more than 6 cards of any type in their hand at the end of the round. If you have more than six cards in hand you must make a decision as to which you&rsquo;d like to discard, or offer them to other players in order to make a deal.<br/><br/>Once a player has performed all four of, or the actions they desire to perform for that turn, turn order moves to the next person in gameplay. When it isn&rsquo;t your turn there are a few things you can do as well.<br/><br/>1.    Barter with other players. This includes assisting them, or bribing them so that you don&rsquo;t hinder them.<br/>2.    Play cards against other players. This can come from your hand only, not previously active cards.<br/><br/>The game continues in this way until winning conditions are fulfilled by one faction player.<br/><br/>",

There are several ways players can accumulate cash, including getting jobs and gambling, but the trick is getting it into their bank account before they lose it.<br/><br/>The game board is a racetrack complete with a shortcut and spaces designed to create action or force decisions on every turn. Players use dice to move around the board and acquire Jobs (and a subsequent salary), receive Emails, collect cash payouts, and perform variety of other actions. Everyone starts by using dice and can use cash they collect to invest in other forms of transportation which allow them to strategically use up to 3 dice each roll, this also increases their job salary and the frequency at which they get paid.<br/><br/>There is a deck of Email cards with corresponding email spaces on the board that subject the players to a variety of events good and bad including salary increases, bills, and cards with the power to hinder other players' progress. Once players collect cash, they try to land on an ATM space in order to deposit into their bank account. Until a player's cash is safely deposited into the bank, it is fair game and can be stolen by other players, or lost in several other ways.<br/><br/>MadCash can be played individually or as teams with goal of accumulating a bank balance of $50,000. Game duration can vary greatly because of the volatility and unpredictability of the game play.<br/><br/>The game is designed in the tradition of other financial race games like Monopoly and Parker Brothers Full House, but with more of a ruthless, backstabbing element with no player ever truly being out of the race until the game is over.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The first to retire or last to burnout wins.<br/><br/>Each player takes turns drawing a card from the Event pile.

You'll take turns hosting summits and contributing (or not!) to helping solve the Earth's problems, all while trying to figure out what your purported allies' end goals are. The fate of the planet is at stake; will you rise to the occasion, or fall to petty infighting?<br/><br/>Taking inspiration from the crisis mechanics of beloved board games Battlestar Galactica and Dead of Winter, World Crisis Simulator sees everyone at the table contributing to that round's summit, with each player having a chance to take the reigns and be the Summit Host. The host gets to decide if the summit is successful, bringing the Earth back to stability, or fails, making everyone's status ever more dire. While everyone in the game probably wants to get through this thing with humanity intact, players' secret objectives will inevitably interfere with them acting in the best interests of everyone else. Act too selfishly though, and other players will use their action cards to cripple your strategy, or even remove you from the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, when you look at rules book, try to play a round with your kids. You would realize this game is much more interesting than you thought.<br/><br/>Space Rescue has three method to play. Basic method is built barrier to stop another player and roll the dice to decide how many step you can move. Once you decide your moving code, another player will help you to move your chess and let you know if your chess is moving to the position you expect or stop by some unknown barriers. The first player who get into finish line wins the game.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;Intermediate game play method is add the instruction dice into the game. This dice gives you three extra variable. Loops, Function call and Boolean value. Combine Loops and digital dice together for example, it will give the player a chance to double one of their movement, let the player go two steps further or block by barrier.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;The most interesting part is the Function call and Boolean value. Function call gives players a chance to choose a function blow the instruction board, take a unexpected step and win the game. Boolean value is a hypothesis programming language. Using &ldquo;IF THEN or ELSE&rdquo;&nbsp;to detecting other player&rsquo;s barriers, bypass the barriers and take a move. But if there is no any barrier, it will do the ELSE step.<br/><br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;It is an interesting for kids to training their logical analyze ability, programming thinking, perseverance and pre-judgement ability.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On Unknown Fields: Scenarios and Fog-of-War Rules for Battles of the American Civil War<br/>This book provides nine fictional scenarios and fog-of-war rules for the American Civil War for use with many game systems. The scenarios are for medium and large battles.<br/><br/>What is a miniature wargame scenario? <br/>At least a map, orders of battle, initial deployments and a schedule of reinforcements. So any scenario should be usable with any American Civil War game system for which the orders of battle and map scale make sense.<br/><br/>Why fictional scenarios, battles that could have happened but didn&rsquo;t? Historical scenarios give knowledgeable players way too much information about their opponent and take away many command decisions. And you&rsquo;ve probably already played scenarios based on most major historical battles of the American Civil War anyway. So how about trying some brand new situations that test your skills, situations that let YOU make the decisions?<br/><br/>Why fog-of-war rules? Do you want to keep your enemies guessing as to what you&rsquo;re up to and distract them with fake maneuvers? Do you want to disguise your attack plans, mass your forces where they&rsquo;re least expected, and then launch blistering attacks? Are you bold enough to plan and execute attacks like Jackson&rsquo;s at Chancellorsville? If so, then you need fog-of-war rules!<br/><br/>You get:<br/><br/>     Nine fictional scenarios for use with any American Civil War game system that has divisions/brigades as its basic units. All scenarios and rules are adaptable for game systems that are based on brigades/regiments&hellip;.<br/>     Orders of battle for Shouting the Battle Cry of Freedom and another popular game. The orders of battle can be used as templates to create orders of battle for other rule systems&hellip;.<br/>     Maps and initial situation write-ups for all scenarios with initial deployments and arrival times for reinforcements&hellip;.<br/>     Unique, general purpose fog-of-war rules that allow hidden movement and deployment for use in all of the scenarios and in scenarios designed for other game systems&hellip;.<br/>     Night and sleep rules for multi-day battles&hellip;.<br/>     Color-coded troop tags for all orders of battle&hellip;.<br/>     Hidden deployment and movement cards for use with the fog-of-war rules&hellip;.<br/>     Terrain markers (Light/Medium/Heavy) for hiding the nature of terrain until units actually enter it&hellip;.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Their success resulted in the destruction of the elite German Sixth Army at Stalingrad, the disintegration of Germany's Allied Armies and the unhinging of the entire Axis position in the Ukraine. The Axis, for the first time, were thrown on the strategic defensive and the road to Kursk. The Germans, for their part, unleashed 'Winter Storm' and the famous Manstein 'backhand blow' which did much to restore the situation.

They also place a letter disc along the net. A number and a letter die are rolled to determine the result of the shot, but generally the receiver will play a second letter disc. This procedure is repeated although starting with the third shot players must draw a card which may change how it is played.<br/><br/>The general object is to force your opponent to complete a word of at least four letters.

It puts you and your family and friends directly in the role as a researcher at the Diamond Light Source, visiting different beamlines to make progress in a diverse range of scientific projects in Physics, Chemistry, Cultural Heritage, and more. As you travel around the synchrotron you will have to make the most of your experiments, as well as working with your fellow players, in order to be remembered as the most famous scientist!<br/><br/>Players move around the synchrotron, stopping at different beamlines that let them make progress in specific scientific disciplines. Once at a beamline, players perform an experiment, drawing cards that represent either successes or failure. They can draw as many cards as they want, but beware! If you draw 2 failure cards you must stop, and lose half of your successes. Once the experiment is finished, players can assign their successes to ongoing projects matching the discipline - once all requirements are met on a project it is completed, and will earn you fame. Once a set number of projects are completed, the game ends, and the scientist with the highest amount of fame wins!<br/><br/>Dr Mark Basham and Dr Claire Murray from Diamond Light Source and Dr Matthew Dunstan from the University of Cambridge created the game to showcase both the research performed at this world-leading facility, but also to give you first-hand experience of the different aspects of actually working in scientific research. Whether it is the variety of science that exists, the timely value of a vital collaboration, the disappointment of a failed experiment, or gratitude for the help from a friendly staff scientist, the game puts you directly in the action so you can make your own choices about what type of scientist you want to be.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

He was credited with 352 Allied aircraft downed - of which 350 were Soviet and 2 American over the course of WW2. This was despite 16 separate instances of being forced to crash land his fighter - either due to mechanical failure or to damage incurred from the debris of enemy aircraft he himself had shot down.<br/><br/>Prior to the War he was a glider pilot, but joined the Luftwaffe in 1940 and had completed his training by 1942. Posted to Jagdgeschwader 52, a veteran wing on the Eastern front, he benefitted from the supervision of some of the Luftwaffe's most experienced pilots, flying the Messerschmitt BF109G.<br/><br/>As his reputation developed he gained the nickname Cherniy Chort (&quot;Black Devil&quot;), both because of his skill and his aircraft's paint scheme. Hartmann was greatly decorated for his achievements, ultimately receiving the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, Swords and Diamonds on 25th August 1944 having achieved 301 aerial victories. This was, at the time, Germany's highest military decoration.<br/><br/>Hartmann's final victory came at midday on 8 May 1945, hours before the German surrender. Turned over to the Red Army, he was tried on war crimes and sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment. He was released in 1955 and posthumously released of all charges (in 1997).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

He was the son of Polish immigrants to Pennsylvania. Abandoning his second year at Notre-Dame University, Gabreski enlisted in the USAAF, though was not a particularly successful trainee.<br/><br/>Trained on the P-36 and P-40, Gabreski began flying sorties in the wake of Pearl Harbour to intercept further Japanese attacks, though they had withdrawn. Concerned that the US lacked experienced pilots, Gabreski volunteered and was accepted (as a Captain) on RAF duty with Polish pilots of No. 315 squadron. It was here he learnt the art of staying calm in combat.<br/><br/>On February 27, 1943, Gabreski became part of the 56th Fighter Group, flying the Republic P-47C Thunderbolt, assigned to the 61st Fighter Squadron, and despite resentment from his fellow pilots he was soon elevated to Major and took command of the Squadron on June 9th. In the cockpit of a Thunderbolt in the European theatre, Gabreski achieved 28 aerial victories, a total never surpassed in the theatre by U.S pilots engaged with the Luftwaffe. On June 20, 1944, Gabreski had achieved the 300 hours required flight time, but rather than go home (for his wedding) he took one more mission. Following damage to his propellers after a strafing run on a Luftwaffe airfield, he was forced to crash land. He managed to evade capture for 5 days before being sent to Stalag Luft.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The board resembled Monopoly and was geographically faithful-ish to Omaha.<br/><br/>It is one of the first modern board games created by black game designers. The rules are designed so that people will become familiar with Omaha. The purpose of the game was to learn the city's history and notable locations. Locations include the Orpheum Theater, Rosenblatt Stadium, Henry Doorly Zoo, Civic Auditorium, Bank of Florence, Central High School, Joslyn Art Museum, Peony Park, Boystown, Southroads, Union Stock Yards, Crossroads, Fort Calhoun, Hummel Park, Great Plains Black Museum, Ak-Sar-Ben and many more.

        "description": "Red Fred is a trick-taking game for three players (the rules state that it can be modified for other numbers, but do not give specifics).<br/><br/>A standard 52-card deck is dealt into four 13-card hands - one for each player and one which is left in a face-down dummy stack to the left of the dealer. Players then freely bid for the number of tricks they will take, beginning with the dealer and proceeding counter-clockwise (i.e., in the reverse of the play order).<br/><br/>The dummy stack leads to every trick - the top card is turned over. Suit must be followed and there is no trump.<br/><br/>Each player scores points based on how many tricks they took, with three tricks being worth no points and other numbers being more valuable the further they are from three. In addition a five-point bonus is scored for making one's bid.<br/><br/>",

The Card Game is bias-free, nonpartisan fun for the whole family.   Politics! The Card Game was created by two-time Senate candidate Jensen Bohren during his initial 2018 run for Senate in Mississippi.<br/><br/>The basics of the game are as follows.<br/>The first turn, every player puts a card from their hand face down, then reveal at the same time.  The lowest unpaired card takes the cards into their score pile, then plays a card face-up, The rest of the players play their next cards face up in clockwise order. This repeats until all hands are empty.<br/><br/>If a round can't be scored, another round is played starting with the person who played first last round.  Once a round is won, the winning player takes all the cards into their score pile.<br/><br/>Once hands are empty, the player with the lowest score wins.  Scoring is based on how many of each number is in the score pile.<br/><br/>",

The rules recommend using one deck with two or three players and two with more, but experienced players may always use two decks.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 9 or 12 cards (12 being more challenging) and attempts to make sets of three cards (trios) which are consecutive multiples of the same number, e.g. 2-4-6 or 55-66-77. This is done via standard Rummy-style play - a player draws the top card of the deck or discard pile and then discards a card. If a joker is used in a trio a player holding the card it is representing may also swap that for the joker.<br/><br/>Completed trios are placed face-up on the table. Players may lay off cards on any trio to form longer sequences, and may also form new trios in different directions.<br/><br/>",

The other player plays a card and the two are compared; the high card wins the trick. The joker is the highest card but is beaten by the ace (which is otherwise low). The winner leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>In the second through fourth hands the winner of the previous hand deals and then may exchange hands with the other player before leading to the first trick.<br/><br/>Play continues either until the end of the fourth hand, in which case the winner of that hand wins the game, or until a player reaches 100 points.

Once discussion is complete, the players simultaneously remove their player piece or leave it, and afterwards the tile is revealed.  If the number of oranges placed on the kotatsu is less than that shown on the tile, the player(s) who performed the chore split the pot as evenly as possible.  However, if the number of oranges placed on the kotatsu is greater than the value of the tile, the player(s) who performed the chore only split the oranges up to the value of the tile.<br/><br/>In either case, any remaining oranges are split as evenly as possible among the players who stayed in the kotatsu!<br/><br/>The tile is set aside face up; the lead player moves clockwise; and play continues.

She was arguably the most famous of these ships due to her role in Operation Chariot in 1942.<br/><br/>Though she saw a brief service with the Royal Netherlands Navy, her most famed action was that against the dry dock of St Nazaire. This facility was the World&rsquo;s largest dry-dock, and provided a site of vital strategic interest to both Allies and Axis, offering a gateway to the Atlantic and large enough to house the mighty Tirpitz and Bismarck. Should they have been unleashed upon Atlantic convoy shipping, the war effort will have suffered incredibly.<br/><br/>With the dock well into an estuary and capital ship involvement an impossibility, a daring plan was concocted. HMS Campbeltown would be disguised as a German ship and, along with a flotilla, would be laden with explosives and used as a ram against the dock gates. Simultaneously, the flotilla would disgorge their loads of British Commandos to sow chaos amongst the Kriegsmarine defenders. The vessels and their payloads of munitions and men were seen as expendable, such was the critical nature of this mission.<br/><br/>Though both Allied and Axis losses were heavy the mission was a complete success &ndash; with the dry-dock knocked out of action for the duration of the war, and the threat of the Tirpitz sailing the Atlantic never materializing.<br/><br/>Contains 1 ship.

A starting point is also designated.<br/><br/>The game is played in partnerships. The first player is followed by an opponent and so on.<br/><br/>Players use marked coins as balls and small lengths of wood as clubs. The object is of course to get the ball into the next hole. However, hitting another player's ball (even your partner's) gets a player another turn, which is an important part of the game. Finishing a hole also gives a player another turn.<br/><br/>A partnership wins when both players complete the last hole.<br/><br/>",

Players race each other to be the first to reach a party, but they can't attend it until they've picked up everything they need first<br/><br/>First of all, they'll need to find a cake, a candle and a present, all in the same colour scheme, which is trickier than it sounds. This is achieved by landing on the appropriate space and drawing cards, with the goal being to create a full set of items in the same colour. They can also land on someone else to pinch the piece they need. On top of that, they'll also need to find an invitation- best beware of the blanks!<br/><br/>Chance cards add a twist to proceedings, with some helping and some hindering progress. A card could launch you just where you need to go to secure that last item, or they could make you wear the dreaded &quot;silly hat&quot;, which prevents you from picking up any items at all.<br/><br/>Candles and Cakes is a simple game which relies more on chance than strategy, but which has colourful graphics, a novel jigsaw-style board, and scope for up to 8 players. Suitable for kids aged 6 and above.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game combines scientific and adventurous aspects. The game idea is based on the famous thought experiment formulated by the Austrian theoretical physicist Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger. The experiment describes a cat that turns out to be both alive and dead due to circumstances and formalism of quantum mechanics. This unusual state makes the Schr&ouml;dinger's cat widely popular in contemporary mainstream culture.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to save the Schr&ouml;dinger's cat from inhumane experiments. Notwithstanding the long and complicated story of the cat, the basic rules are simple enough to understand by every person, even if he or she is unfamiliar with the paradox of the Schr&ouml;dinger's cat. Nonetheless, science enthusiasts will definitely notice that the rules contain multiple allusions to the quantum mechanical world view.<br/><br/>The game is represented as a labyrinth with the changing structure - the Schr&ouml;dinger's castle. The winner is the player who managed to find the Schrodinger's cat in the labyrinth and led it to his starting point. The distinctive feature of the game is that all players can build and change the structure of the labyrinth the way they want. Specially elaborated system of action cards used on each player's turn is also of interest. Despite the randomness factor during a turn, it allows players to develop a unique long-term strategy.<br/><br/>The labyrinth consists of 19 wooden hexagonal elements - the halls of Schr&ouml;dinger's castle. The halls contain passageways connecting their different sides. At the beginning of the game, all halls are turned upside down and are not visible to players. During his turn, each player can move around the castle, gradually opening the halls and joining the passages as it suits him. However, as soon as a player leaves any hall, this hall is turned over, and the next player who comes to this hall will be able to open it in a convenient way.<br/><br/>The turns are made by playing action cards (3 cards per turn). These cards allow you to move around the castle, prevent the empty halls from closing, rotate open halls and rearrange closed ones, open locked doors, and arrange baits for Schr&ouml;dinger's cat. At the end of the turn, the player collects up to 3 new cards. The game does not contain direct conflict between players, all interactions take place through the restructuring of a common labyrinth. Victory conditions depend on whether Schr&ouml;dinger's cat is alive or dead, this is also decided by the players during the game.<br/><br/>The game has a colourful minimalistic design. The game board is made of embossed wooden elements. Game elements do not contain any text - all the necessary information is contained in the form of images. The combination of simple rules and richness of game situations resembles chess, however, unlike the latter, the game contains a significant role of chance in the gameplay.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Aztec Football is a 2-player game where two teams of warriors play a match against one another to see who can make the most goals and earn the most points.  Each team has four warriors of different strengths which will move on to the field.  Once on the field, they will try to position themselves so they can maneuver the four colored boulders by pushing and pulling them around the field using their strength. Each of the colored boulders will have a value and you must use a combined strength greater than the value of the boulder to be able to move it.  Be careful where your opponent is, he can use one of his warriors to knock one of your warriors off the field.   The team that is able to push a colored boulder into their goal will earn the point value of that boulder. The winning team will be the one who can obtain the most points from the highest value boulders and the losing team will be sacrificed to the Gods.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each horse has several possible starting positions (determined by the bookmaker) and each has a different number of spaces in its lane.<br/><br/>After odds are set for a race two dice are thrown and the horse corresponding to the higher die is moved one space, or two if doubles are rolled. The horses with higher numbers have more spaces to cover.<br/><br/>At any given time one player is the bookmaker. Before each race they set the odds, which can be 4-1 for all horses or 2-1, 3-1, 4-1, 5-1, and 6-1 assigned as they wish. They also choose where the horses start - the normal start, the handicap start behind this, or even ahead of the normal start.

If a stack has just one or two cards in it the top card can be captured by placing a card of the same rank on it. There are a few additional rules, e.g. when capturing counterclockwise moves may be made.<br/><br/>At the end of the round captured cards are scored; different suits score differently, e.g. the blue cards are 10 points each, black cards (the longest suit) score only for the player with the most, red cards score for sequences, etc.<br/><br/>Four players play in partnerships; while the rules technically allow for play by four or five individuals, only three play at a time.<br/><br/>Rules are provided to allow play with a standard deck.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, soon after take-off, the plane engine gives out and the pilot is forced to make an emergency landing in the middle of the jungle. Now, stranded in the jungle how will you &ndash; and your companions who you don&rsquo;t know &ndash; survive and escape? Can you trust them? Will you work together or splinter off on your own? The choice is yours.<br/><br/>In Amazon Peril, you and your companions will begin the game, lost somewhere in the jungle and you will have to use your skills to explore, survive and escape the jungle by finding the airstrip you left from. Each round is a day; you&rsquo;ll make plans in the morning, in the afternoon you&rsquo;ll execute them and in the evening you&rsquo;ll assess your thirst, hunger and health and prepare for the next day.<br/><br/>Each morning, choose from these core actions: camping for the day (where you try to rest up and heal), scouting (where you&rsquo;ll cautiously explore the jungle around you) and exploring (where you&rsquo;ll move through the jungle, placing and revealing new tiles that can lead to many dangerous and exciting outcomes; maybe you&rsquo;ll stumble across an indigenous tribe, find ancient ruins or encounter dangerous wildlife).<br/><br/>You may choose to go it alone for riskier encounters but more rewards; or journey in groups to lessen the risk but split the rewards. But be careful; desperate circumstances can bring out the worst in people. You might be tempted to steal supplies from your companions at night or they might steal from you!<br/><br/>As you journey through the jungle, you can gain or lose renown points for the actions you take and the discoveries you make. It isn&rsquo;t just about survival; those who survive will have tales to tell and deeds to boast of - and whomever has the most renown points when the airstrip is finally revealed will win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battleground Brawl is a tabletop, platform fighting game that pits fighters (players) against each other in an attempt to either deplete the opponents health, or knock them off of the play area, in order to score points.<br/><br/>The play area consists of a board with a grid. This grid is the guide for where platforms and players can be placed. To set up the game, players agree on the placement of the platform pieces and then choose where to place their fighters. For round 1, the player with the lowest health starts, and each subsequent round the &quot;first player&quot; moves clockwise. Each round, players must first take it in turns, going clockwise from the &quot;first player&quot;, to move their fighters according to their movement field. If a player moves adjacent to another player, then that player is not allowed to move in this turn, as they are deemed to be engaged in battle.<br/><br/>Once all players that can move, have moved, then the combat phase begins. Each player plays a card face-down from their hand and chooses a target opponent. A hand consists of 5 cards drawn from that players deck. A deck consists of a number of cards available to each fighter.<br/><br/>Once every player has played a card face down and declared a target, flip the cards and resolve them in the same order as movement in that round. Some cards may be played out of order, as a reaction to other cards, for example: If Player 1 targets Player 4 with an attack card, but Player 4 played a dodge card, then Player 4 resolves this action before Players 2 and 3. If Player 2 (and/or 3) also targeted Player 4, they target that players previous location and therefore Player 4 dodges all attacks simultaneously, they do not target the new location.<br/><br/>Once all actions have been resolved and health deducted/added where appropriate, the &quot;first player&quot; switches clockwise and the next round begins. Discard previously played cards and draw your hand back up to 5 cards. Declare your movement (if applicable), then your targets, then play your next card, and repeat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The pieces have semicircles along their edges.<br/><br/>Players are attempting to construct a path of their pieces between two opposite edges of the board. When pieces are next to each other their semicircles will join to form full circles. If a player can play a piece on top of an opposing piece so that at least two squares are covered and it forms more circles with adjacent pieces, the opposing piece is captured and replaced.<br/><br/>When a path between edges is formed (and can't be broken by an immediate capture) each player counts their longest path and the player with the longer one scores the difference. A series of games should be played to determine the overall winner.<br/><br/>The designer later (in Games &amp; Puzzles #50) suggested playing with two copies of each piece instead, or using a 24x24 board.<br/><br/>",

Everything from a word that the other party says, to the action that got lost for a moment, is a psychological battle of batch bees that is a hint to win.<br/><br/>During the game you can feel the extraordinary tension, like the world of Yakuza. It is a game that you want to play with people who are close to each other and who know each other's personality. This game generally belongs to the genre called &quot;identity concealment type game&quot;. For this reason, revealing your identity (who is the boss in this game) is synonymous with defeat in the game.<br/><br/>Actually, if the identity is out of the way, such as in a werewolf game, the game is not over immediately, but it will inevitably be at a disadvantage. And most of the information in this game is open. The information hidden by the opponent is only the main card of each other, and the contents of the hand are visible to each other until the end of the game.<br/><br/>Therefore, the important information is from &quot;what to put out&quot; to &quot;a little action that I tried to put in this character for a moment&quot;.

The rules say that each player gets 20 small sticks (e.g. matchsticks) to use, in different colors, but lines may simply be drawn in. A move is placing or drawing a line between two adjacent dots (vertices).<br/><br/>In each round one player attempts to make as long a continuous line as possible and the other player attempts to stop them. The linemaker plays first and afterwards must always play at one end of their line, unless a loop is formed with no ends in which case it may branch anywhere. The linemaker may never have more than two ends.<br/><br/>The other player may play on any open line segment.<br/><br/>When the linemaker can no longer play they score the number of lines they used and players swap roles.<br/><br/>",

You and up to 4 four other friends will help the local sensei to rebuild their resepective dojos. Make the cards dance around the table as you draft them: sensei, spies, shuriken, flaming shuriken, walls, and temples. The first to build a sensei's dojo wins all glory!<br/><br/>During your turn, draft a card, perform an action, draft a 2nd card, and perform another action. Free actions may be performed unlimited times at any point during your turn.<br/><br/>To build a sensei&rsquo;s dojo, collect a set of set of 4 cards matching the same suit. (Ex. 1 stone temple, 1 stone eastern wall, 1 stone western wall, and 1 stone sensei). Place them in their appropriate spaces within your 6 space, pyramid-shaped, player area.<br/><br/>In addition to set collection, each card type has a unique ability. For example, if you have a sensei in your play area, you may throw a shuriken (spend the shuriken by taping one of its corners on the opponent&rsquo;s targeted card) do attack! Combine certain card types to unlock hidden abilities! Ex: Having the wood sensei and the wood temple allows you to search the discard pile for 1 wall card (once per turn). You may also strategically place cards face-down to keep a card safe, withhold it from an enemy, or even to set a trap!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

While Rocco the Rhino works to move the Yak, you try to steal as many of the train cars as possible.<br/><br/>Yakson the Yak lived near a railroad in the forest. Being a fussy eater, he knew all the tastiest grass grew between the rails of the tracks; so whenever he was hungry, Yakson would stand right in the middle of the tracks to eat. Luckily for Yakson, the train has an expert at the wheel.<br/><br/>Rocco is the best railroad engineer around. He is the only one who can stop fast enough to save Yakson, but what is his thanks? Every time he stops, that Yak steals all of his train cars!<br/><br/>In this 2-5 player game, plays put down a yak card to steal all the train cars played. The player with the most stolen cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/>Deal each player 5 cards. Place the rest of the cards face down in the middle as a draw pile.<br/><br/>Place the Rocco the Rhino Engine card face up. Draw one train card from the draw pile and put it on the end of the engine card to start the train.<br/><br/>Each player takes turns adding train cards end to end so that the color and character at the end of the last train card matches the one you are playing.<br/><br/>After you put down a card, draw a new card from the draw pile so you have 5 cards in your hand. If you can't play a train card on your turn, pass and don't draw. Play moves to the next player.<br/><br/>If you have a yak card, you can play it on your turn or hold it to play later. After playing a yak card, player picks up all the cards in the train, expect for the engine, and places them in a pile in front of them. The game continues until all 5 yaks have been played.<br/><br/>The person with the most cards from the train (including the yaks) wins.<br/><br/>Wild Zebra can be played if you can't play anything else.

However, units have different movement allowances and no unit can exceed its allowance. (Counting generals there are nine different types of units.)<br/><br/>When combat takes place different units may lend their combat value or morale value based on their positions relative to the attacking and defending units.<br/><br/>There are some additional rules for terrain (hexagons representing hills and a town are placed on the board before the game), reinforcements, and formation of infantry &quot;squares.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Inflation is a simple auction game for three or more players (the original rules give no upper limit; six seems like a practical maximum).<br/><br/>The game requires a supply of counters and three decks of ten cards each. Each deck is used in turn: it is shuffled and the cards are auctioned off using open bidding. Bidding is done with the counters; every player gets one counter before each auction.<br/><br/>The first deck contains two cards worth four points, four worth two, and four worth one. Each succeeding deck has the same distribution of cards but halves their values, e.g. the second deck has two two-point cards.<br/><br/>Once all cards have been auctioned the player with the greatest total value of cards wins; counters are worth nothing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game has been designed after extensive research on the Brexit process for my PhD. It aims at simulating as closely as possible while remaining a rather simple (yet big) boardgame the various power shifts that we saw in 2019. (A playtest held a few days before the 2019 general elections saw the Tories win an absolute majority and getting rid of their coalition with the DUP... just sayin')<br/><br/>This is a political game focused on player interactions with half the game revolving around card play inspired by the Sun Tzu boardgame and the other half centered on players negotiating between them how they will vote on the Draft Bills proposed to the floor. It is a long and difficult game that requires a minimum of role playing as players take on specific parties' leadership with specific objectives. It is an asymetrical game where each player has a specific way of winning in order to show the various strategies deployed during 2019 by the real life parties.<br/>The first one is the campaign map. Players compete each turn to gain popularity in 21 constituencies by playing cards and comparing their values. (Similar to the Sun Tzu game's mechanic.) Having more popularity than others gives players a chance to increase their number of Members of Parliament once an election is held. But only the Prime Minister can call for an election, with a little push from the opposition if needed...<br/><br/>The second battleground is parliament. Players propose Draft Bills to vote into the Brexit Deal. Those bills are policies that tackle Brexit-specific issues. Depending on how the issue is tackled and who proposed the bill, the Brexit Deal gets filled up with policies that grant Victory Points to players, or removes some. For that phase, players vote with all the might of their MPs in Parliament. This is why having an election at the right time can completely change the balance of power in the Westminster House of Commons, and change the face of Brexit as a whole !<br/><br/>The final competition takes place around those two phases as players get to play Spin Cards, showing how their political teams spin events and control the political landscape.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Before each roll, all players can put some (or all or none) of their funds into the bank as a bet. Based on the roll, the pawn is moved (with possible re-rolls) and the color where the pawn lands determines what happens to everyone's bets. This can have varying results, including &quot;lose all money in the bank&quot;, &quot;win 10x your bet&quot; or even &quot;lose all money NOT currently in the bank&quot;.<br/><br/>This may sound like a game of pure chance but there is some strategy involved because of the re-rolls, the distribution of colors on the board (e.g. at any given moment, there is higher probability of pawn ending its turn on color X and not on any other color) and the changing order in which the players place their bets.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to own 1,000,000 of &quot;Game Crowns&quot; (fake money).<br/><br/>",

Instead of marching peacefully to the forest the koalas are now starting to gather in the city and riot!<br/><br/>Bad Koalas is fully-cooperative, which means players win or lose as a team. Only one player takes a turn at a time, but they may solicit feedback from other players.<br/><br/>&bull; The deck contains of 4 different colors (types) of koalas.<br/>&bull; The play area is communal for all players. It consists of four columns, one for each koala type. The horizontal row of 4 zones at the bottom of each column is collectively called the City; each koala that enters play from the deck is placed into the city zone that corresponds to that koala&rsquo;s color.<br/>&bull; Koalas are unhappy in the city; when too many of them end a turn in the same city zone, they riot, which leads to problems for the players.<br/>&bull; The center row above the City is called the Country. Koalas in the country are relatively happy and therefore don&rsquo;t riot like the koalas in the city.<br/>&bull; The row of zones at the top of each column is called the forest; players want to advance koalas to the forest to score them (flip them over) and gain upgraded action powers that the happy koalas in the forest grant you.<br/>&bull; Above the play area are the 4 action cards that each player can choose from on their turn. Each action is dedicated to moving koalas up toward the forest zones. (The koala token must be moved to a different action card each turn; you can&rsquo;t select the same action that was chosen the previous turn.)<br/>&bull; On their turn, the active player moves the koala token to the action card of their choice, resolves that action, and then places into the city zones the (2+) new koalas that automatically come out of the deck... and resolves any riots that ensue as a result. Then the next player in clockwise turn order takes their turn. The game ends immediately when players win or lose together.<br/><br/>All players win immediately if at any time all koalas have been cleared from the city and country zones.<br/><br/>All players lose if either of the following conditions are met:<br/>&bull; if there are 15 or more koalas in the city zones<br/>&bull; if the koala deck is empty when a card is required to be drawn<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Since it's a government asset intended for use at sea, it's made of fantastically high-quality materials which help to make up for how utterly inane the actual trivia proves to be (example: According to the 1972 mandate, what is the minimum length of sounding cord that should be trailed behind any vessel approaching a port from the leeward side with the intention to transfer cargo after dusk?&quot;). The game box also includes a copy of the hefty &quot;Collision Regulations: International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972 - with Canadian modifications, 1983&quot;.<br/><br/>Players start out taking only yellow coastal routes, but as their knowledge progresses their ships (oddly represented as multicoloured faux bullets made of iron termed &quot;projies&quot;) can move out into the ocean, ultimately needing to reach certain key ports and complete specific routes, all while avoiding hazards and inclement weather. The winner is officially termed the &quot;Commander of the High Seas&quot;, and more importantly the Canadian naval personnel have passed another two hours at sea. The popularization of video games ultimately rendered traditional classics like &quot;High Seas&quot; less necessary.<br/><br/>It was reported that the initial printing was of only 100 copies of the game in October 1987 for initial deployment and testing, and it's unclear whether there were later versions produced as the rules stated &quot;Copyright 1988&quot;; it is referred to in naval literature as both &quot;High Seas: A Collision/s Regulation Game&quot; and &quot;High Seas: A Performance Maintenance Game&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The duration of a game is 1 to 2 hours.<br/><br/>The units (leaders or combat units) have a movement and combat capability (possibly including firepower) and represent 500 to 1000 or 2000 men depending on the type of unit and the scenario. For some scenarios, these figures are theoretical given the sources (difficult to represent the million men of Darius or Xerxes or others).<br/><br/>The system is based on the initiative won by players as a result of a die roll and the impact of leaders and/or other modifiers in the scenario.<br/><br/>In ARS BELLUM, the system is based on the skills of the units, which balance reality and gameplay. These are abilities assigned to units, basic or special, that represent a property or advantage during combat.<br/><br/>The basic module of the game gives the essential rules and discovery scenarios; the extensions are groupings of scenarios around one or more armies, a historical character, a military campaign.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Revivez les grandes batailles de l'Antiquit&eacute; et &agrave; la t&ecirc;te de votre arm&eacute;e, imposez votre puissance &agrave; votre adversaire !<br/><br/>ARS BELLUM est un jeu de complexit&eacute; moyenne, permettant de simuler toutes les batailles de l&rsquo;Antiquit&eacute;.

Leur style est simple, propre. La dur&eacute;e d&rsquo;une partie est d&rsquo;1 &agrave; 2h.<br/><br/>Les unit&eacute;s (chefs ou de combat) ont une capacit&eacute; de mouvement  et de combat (regroupant &eacute;ventuellement celle de tir) et repr&eacute;sentent 500 &agrave; 1000 ou 2000 hommes suivant le type d&rsquo;unit&eacute;s et le sc&eacute;nario. Pour certains sc&eacute;narios, ces chiffres sont th&eacute;oriques compte tenu des sources (difficiles de repr&eacute;senter le million d&rsquo;hommes de Darius ou Xerx&egrave;s ou autres).<br/><br/>Le syst&egrave;me est bas&eacute; sur l&rsquo;initiative conquise par les joueurs suite &agrave; un jet de d&eacute; et &agrave; l&rsquo;impact des chefs et/ou autre modificateur dans le sc&eacute;nario.<br/><br/>Dans ARS BELLUM, le syst&egrave;me s&rsquo;appuie sur les comp&eacute;tences des unit&eacute;s qui am&egrave;nent respect de la r&eacute;alit&eacute; et particularit&eacute; ludique. Ce sont des capacit&eacute;s attribu&eacute;es aux unit&eacute;s, de base ou particuli&egrave;res et qui repr&eacute;sentent une propri&eacute;t&eacute; ou un avantage durant le combat.<br/><br/>Le module de base du jeu donne l&rsquo;essentiel des r&egrave;gles et les sc&eacute;narios de d&eacute;couverte ; les extensions sont des regroupements de sc&eacute;narios autour d&rsquo;une ou plusieurs arm&eacute;es, d&rsquo;un personnage historique, d&rsquo;une campagne militaire.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You, the royal messenger, must return to the palace and deliver the urgent message you've received from the scouts as quickly as possible.<br/>Fail to deliver your message in time - and the palace will come under attack before the High King's armies have been mustered!<br/><br/>Quick as you are, this challenge may be too hard even for you, messenger. The palace is far away, and it'd normally take you seven days to cover the distance. Now, you only have five. What's more, the roads have become much more dangerous of late. Nevertheless, set out you must, if the High King is to receive the warning in time!<br/><br/>Your goal is to return to the palace and deliver your message in five days or less. Along the way, you will face several challenges and come across several people and animals. Each day will present a new challenge or encounter. While some will hinder you, others will help you make it to the palace in time.<br/><br/>Your base speed is 40 miles per day, and the royal palace is 280 miles away from your starting point. You won't make it in time unless you somehow manage to increase your speed. Perhaps something or someone along the way will help make you faster...<br/><br/>Each time you play, you will draw up to five cards - one card each turn - and face at least three different challenges. It is up to you to decide whether you take on the encounter of the day or avoid it. While some encounters can be automatically avoided, others require you to successfully hide in order to avoid them, and some encounters simply cannot be avoided. You must take on at least three of the encounters you come across (including those which cannot be avoided).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Poker Family is a card game variant of Poker that allows beginners and families to play the game.<br/><br/>Poker Family is a card game for 2 to 8 players, suitable from about 6 years. It takes about 45 to 120 minutes, depending on the number of poker chips used or the amount of play money. The game comes with a poker card deck of 55 cards; a set of double-sided cards with poker chips on one side and play money on the other. Additional accessories are also included to make the poker rules and the flow of the game more understandable to younger players and beginners.<br/><br/>Poker Family is played according to the rules of Texas Hold'em: The cards are shuffled well. The players next to the card reading place the Small and Big blind. Each player gets 2 cards. There is a first round of bidding (call, raise, fold). Then 3 community cards are revealed. The 2nd round of bidding takes place. The 4th and 5th community cards are revealed, followed by the bidding rounds. The players remaining at the end of the round who have not folded show their poker cards in the showdown. From their own 2 cards and the 5 revealed community cards, the players try to form the highest ranking cards. The player who has formed the highest ranking cards at the end of the game gets the pot of poker chips or play money.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Its a great game for when you need that quick gaming fix as it sets up and plays in as little as 10 - 15 minutes.<br/><br/>In Mirage, you must survive for six days. Search the Gobi Desert by placing your 'Exploration Tokens' at specific areas and resolving 'Exploration' cards . These will either be helpful or harmful locations, useful items or dangerous enemy encounters.<br/><br/>Choose areas wisely, as exploring the same place will have a smaller effect on your stats, .....BUT, cause you to be ambushed by a stalking enemy. Searching further afield has a more detrimental effect on your stats but you are not subject to the punishing ambush attack.<br/><br/>Manage your vital stats of Health, Water and Stamina in order to stay alive. Adapt your strategy based on your current stats and items at hand.<br/><br/>As well as the 'Standard' game challenge, you can play as one of several realistic Royal Air Force characters to further bring the game to life. Each character comes with specific starting items and stats. The 'Epic' level challenge will certainly keep you tested to the max!!<br/><br/>Welcome to the first in the Survival Series.....welcome to Mirage!.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player chooses a survivor with different characteristics and receives at the beginning of the game a goal that is inspired by several films of the genre.<br/><br/>During the game, players face the undead with the roll of the dice that is also used to activate cards that can be used both for combat and to help them fulfill their secret objectives and win the game.<br/><br/>Other locations can enter play, symbolizing the path taken by the survivors. The entire turn, players draw a survivor card, which can be actions or equipment (simplifying), and also draw a zombie card, which can be the undead themselves, or some negative event that occurs on the turn. Drawing zombies always stay in the same location, affecting all players who are there. For this reason the more people in the same place, the more dangerous it becomes.<br/><br/>The combat in the game is performed with the dice roll, where the result is added to the survivor's equipment and skills. Zombies don't roll damage, but they get a bonus for quantity, the more zombies, the more difficult it is. When there is no way to fight the survivors can always escape, which is done in a similar way.<br/><br/>To win the game they must fulfill their objective cards, which have three tasks each. These activities can be killing a certain number of zombies, being in a certain place or having an item. Each objective is different and they follow a short narrative present in the cards. With the three tasks completed, the game is won, if the survivor manages to stay alive until the end of his turn.<br/><br/>Journey Z is a game with a lot of interaction between players, and this can be directly or indirectly, as two people in the same place, even just interacting with the zombies, can completely change the other's plans. Manipulate the result of the die roll, or use cards to gain advantages in confrontations with the undead, but the main thing is to be aware of your victory conditions and know how to use your resources to reach it as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>'-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Examples of what can happen when boredom, beer and too much sunshine mix can be seen in our countryside culture and folklore. Village games and rivalry date back to the Doomsday book and still hold a place in our national pride. One such tradition and probably the original concept for the games of football and rugby, was the Annual Langtoft and Baston Cheese tossing. It involved teams of locals from each respective village attempting to cover the front of the opposing village&rsquo;s pub in stinking cheese. Often participants were drunk and sometimes dressed inappropriately, we&rsquo;ve all known a village idiot! Records show no one was ever fatally injured, more through luck than judgment. Play continued until everyone was too tired to carry on, had had enough or the landlord of the respective pub could stand the stench no more and offered a truce by way of a wagon load of Badgers Bite Brown Ale and the subsequent piss up to the conquering village. Such fun has even witnessed festive games played using Christmas puddings instead of cheese and decorated hard boiled dragons&rsquo; eggs at Easter!<br/><br/>You can now recreate this spectacle on your table top as follows. <br/>Silly hats and a pint in hand are optional but recommended.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In this game, players set traps in the deck for other players to fall into, forcing them to lose cards or sometimes causing you to gain cards. But you can also cast a wide range spells to tip the odds in your favour by migrating enemy plants or boosting your hand size.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to be the last one standing by forcing your opponents to lose cards from picking up your face up plants. If they run out of cards, they are eliminated.<br/><br/>The game gets more and more intense as you go through the game, as the amount of face up plants increase and the amount of safe cards you can draw deplete...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The value of card played determines turn order for the round. Players will plant and/or grow trees each round making already planted trees taller by playing higher valued cards. They will also collect new saplings from a communal area. Turn order is especially important when collecting saplings as some will not be available until others are removed.<br/><br/>The game ends when any player plays their last card or the supply of saplings runs out.<br/><br/>At the end of the game players score their planted trees with bonus points for tall trees and penalties for saplings left in their hand.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Break-A-Leg is a pick and pass card drafting game for 2-5 players that plays in about 30 minutes. Players take on the role of a theatrical producer hiring the best cast, creative, and crew, while simultaneously foiling the plans of the opposing producers.<br/><br/>During each of three recruitment sessions (rounds), players collect cards representing team members from the four theatrical production team areas: Actors, Designers, Run Crew, and Front of House.  Players draft additional Directors, Specialists, and Apprentices to augment their production.The ensemble is assembled into teams, then scored, and players are given a representative for each team they have formed. Bonuses reward multi-round planning, and on the fly strategy adjustment.  At the end of the game, &ldquo;Ghost Light&rdquo; cards collected throughout the rounds score bonuses, and players are rewarded if they have earned a representative from all four teams.<br/><br/>Break-A-Leg is a lightweight game that is easy to learn, yet offers a plethora of options for experienced players, such as draft signaling, counter-picking, multi-round planning, and draft-pick priority.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

While the old playing-card game is a purely random exercise, in 1944 the players get a small hand of cards and must choose which to play. A player&rsquo;s strategy, tactics, memory and hunches can go a long way toward winning. Of course, a little luck wouldn&rsquo;t hurt, either.<br/><br/>As in War, players choose a card from their hand, hold it out face down and reveal them simultaneously to begin a skirmish. The charts on the cards show you the result based on the type of card played by your opponent. These results can be:<br/><br/><br/>     You win the skirmish.<br/>     You lose the skirmish.<br/>     The higher numbered card wins the skirmish. If tied, the skirmish becomes a battle. <br/>     The skirmish becomes a battle.<br/>     The higher letter value wins the skirmish. A is highest, F is lowest. (Fighters only.)<br/>     The skirmish becomes a war.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "POLITRACES is a board game that give you the opportunity to feel like a participant in a real Political Races and prove to others that you deserve to get the Power and become the President!<br/><br/>STANDARD RULES OF THE POLITRACES GAME<br/>business board game for 3-8 players, age 8+<br/><br/>The Goals of the Game<br/><br/>1. Become President - 1st place. It is necessary to pay a fee for participation in the Elections, go to the Small Circle and win the Elections by collecting the most Votes.<br/>2. Become Prime Minister (or Secretary of State) - 2nd place. The President decides who will take this position.<br/>3. Become Oligarch (1) - 3rd place. It is necessary to buy the Institution Oil Derrick. Oligarch has the right to give or exchange their Votes (but not to sell to the Treasury), however they can`t go to the Small Circle and become the President. If the President gives the Oligarch the 2nd place, then they share the 1st place.<br/>-1) Possible if more than 4 players are playing (see the Institution Oil Derrick).<br/><br/>     The remaining players take their places according to the number of collected Votes. <br/>     It is useful for players to choose the strategy, for example:<br/><br/><br/>- collect resources and Votes to pay the Elections fee and try to become the President;<br/>- collect resources to transfer them to your Candidate for Presidency and increase their chances of winning;<br/>- collect resources to buy an Oil Derrick (if available) and become an Oligarch.<br/><br/>     Execution of agreements depends on the wishes of the players.<br/><br/><br/>Ð¡oncept of the Game<br/><br/>All people who strive for power are conventionally divided into four categories that have different, but equal resources, forming the Political Quadrant&copy;:<br/>- Businesspersons (entrepreneurs) - have money or other resources which can be quickly sold;<br/>- Activists (popular people) - know how to gather, motivate and encourage other people to act;<br/>- Public Officials (civil servants) - have connections and authority;<br/>- Experts (smart people) - have special knowledge and status.<br/>To get the Power (win the Game) players need to collect all the specified resources and get voters Votes.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>1. Game preparation<br/><br/>The players, who sit in a circle (1), lay the Playing Field (2) (game board) in the center.<br/>The Chance and Debate cards are shuffled and laid out face down on the specially marked places.<br/>Players choose who of them will be the Treasurer, i.e. responsible for the Treasury (3) (game bank), which is placed at the bottom of the Game Box, which contains cards, chips and others).<br/>-1) Participants play clockwise in the order they originally sit down to play (until the end of the Game).<br/>2) The Playing Field consists of 4 sectors and 2 circles which divided into cells.<br/>Sectors. The Game has 4 color sectors, which correspond to certain resources in the form of chips: Businessperson (green color, Money resource), Activist (purple color, People resource), Public Official (red color, Connections resource), Expert (blue color, Knowledge resource). Each sector consists of seven cells. In each of the sectors there is a START cell with which the Game begins. Having passed the sector cells, the player goes (down) to the Big Circle and plays there (the exception - Go to Another Sector cell). Players may get back to the sectors thanks to the Crisis cells or some of the Chance cards.<br/>The Big Circle is Political Races. It consists of 24 cells. There are also 2 freestanding cells: Jail and Resort.<br/>The Small Circle is Elections. Located in the center of the Playing Field and consists of 6 cells. <br/>3) In the Treasury any 2 resources (same or different) may be exchanged for any other 1 resource or a Vote, but the Votes cannot be sold to the Treasury (except for special game situations). Exchange in the Treasury can be made only at the time of the player`s turn. The Treasury does not give loans, advances, does not accept Real Estate as collateral, etc. Stealing from the Treasury is prohibited.<br/><br/>2. Starting the Game, the first move, next moves<br/><br/>At this stage, players will move between sectors and the Big Circle. To determine who will make the first move each player will throw the Dice one time. The Player, who has the highest number (1) on the Dice, becomes the First Player, selects a pawn (game chip) and puts it on the START of any sector of their choice (2). The remaining players take turns, going around the board clockwise from the First Player by selecting their pawns and putting them on the following START (3) cells.<br/>The Treasurer distributes to each player 5 chips of their basic resources and 2 chips of each remaining resource (4).<br/>For each turn started in a Big or Small Circle, players will receive 1 of their basic resource (5) until the end of the Game from the Treasury (passive income), even when the Elections are announced (except for a situation when a player stays on the Jail cell).<br/>The First Player rolls the playing Dice (with 6 faces) once and moves forward the number of cells indicated on the Dice clockwise.<br/>Once on some cell, the player is obliged to perform the action that is indicated there (only once, when they gets on the cell).<br/>When the Dice is pictured - this means that the player need to roll the Dice to determine what event will occur (the special conditions for the Institution Police). <br/>When some resource or Vote chip is pictured - this means the corresponding resource or Vote chip.<br/>Also, before the end of their move, players have the right to interact with other players and do operations (6).<br/>When the player has completed all the actions, they announces the end of their move (themself).<br/>All next players, clockwise, do the same actions as the First Player.<br/>It is important to be attentive and keep an eye on other players. If someone did something forbidden during the Game (for example, made a move when it should be skipped) or forgot to do something (for example, to get their basic resource), but the player&rsquo;s move is already over, then the Game continues without correcting the situation (except for situations such as moving someone else&rsquo;s pawn).<br/>Players are not allowed to combine their resources and/or Votes.<br/>What is not prohibited is allowed in the Game. This means that players may freely interpret game situations (rules) and make non-standard decisions.<br/>Players can speed up the Game by reducing the Election participation fee, announcing early Elections (counting Votes), limit the time of the players moves using the hourglass or making more Debates (see Debates in the Description of the Game Cells).<br/>- <br/>1) If several players have the same highest number (for example, 6:6), these players will roll the Dice again.<br/>2) There are 4 START cells in the Game in four equivalent sectors, where you may start the Game. This determines the basic resources and right to immunity of the players: Businessperson (green color, Money resource, immunity from the Business Center and Hotel), Activist (purple color, People resource, immunity from the Union of Activists and Society for the Ecology Protection), Public Official (red color, Communications resource, immunity from the Police and Tax Inspection), Expert (blue color, Knowledge resource, immunity from the Institute of Expertise and Academy).<br/>3) If there are more than 4 players, the placement of pawns continues in the second round. That is, the fifth player puts their pawn on the same START cell, on which the First Player pawn stands. And so on.<br/>4) Resources (i.e. game currency). After placing the players pawns, each player receives from the Treasury 5 resources of the sector in which they started the Game (the basic resource), as well as 2 resources from the other sectors.<br/>For example, a player on the START of the Businessperson sector (green color) will receive 5 chips of Money, 2 of People, 2 chips of Connections and 2 chips of Knowledge.<br/>5) If during the Game some player gets into another sector, they still continues to receive their basic resource, which they initially received.<br/>For example, the player started the Game in the Businessperson sector and its basic resource is Money, and then they got into the Public Official sector, but they still remains a Businessperson until the end of the Game and receives one Money as basic resource. <br/>6) Operations. Players can perform any operations that do not violate the Rules of the Game (contacting other players, exchanging or selling their resources and Real Estate, using Chance cards, etc.), but only during their turn. If some player misses a move, they cannot perform operations (exception - the Resort cell).<br/>Resources and Real Estate (except the Oil Derrick) can be freely disposed of (exchanged or sold), while Votes are not (exceptions - see the Oligarch description and the Political Party cell).<br/>Presents. During their turn, players may make or accept gifts: resources, Real Estate, Chance cards.<br/>Out of resources. If the player does not have resources (or Votes) for payment (to another player or to the Treasury) - they must purchase necessary ones (in the Treasury or from other players). If resources are still insufficient, the player must sell their Real Estate (if available). If the player does not have resources or Real Estate for payment, they may either pay 1 Vote to the Treasury (even if they has to pay another player), or go to the Jail for 1 move (except for the Candidate for Presidency).<br/><br/>3. The Small Circle, Election of the President, the end of the Game<br/><br/>To get to the Small Circle, it is necessary to pay a participation fee to the Treasury - 10 of each resources (1) and it is also necessary to have 10 Votes (which remain in the player&rsquo;s hands).<br/>The player can go to the Small Circle only at the beginning of their turn (before the Dice is thrown), but the player is allowed to conduct any operations before this (for example, sell Real Estate or exchange resources with other players).<br/>The player who has moved to the Small Circle (the Oligarch cannot) puts the Game pawn on The Beginning of the Campaign cell and becomes Candidate for Presidency (has immunity and cannot get to Jail when there is nothing to pay).<br/>After one Candidate for Presidency has collected 50 Votes, they announces the Election of the President (2), after which the players finish this Game round (counting from the First Player) and play the Final Round (3).<br/>Elections. After the Final Round was payed, each player may take 1 Vote from the Treasury and give it to their Candidate for Presidency (you could Vote for yourself), after what the Votes are counted and the winner (just 1 person(4)) is announced as President (1st place). <br/>The President decides who gets the 2nd place. <br/>If there is the Oligarch in the Game, they takes the 3rd place (or if the President appoint the Oligarch 2nd place, then the Oligarch shares the 1st place with the President).<br/>The remaining players are ranked according to the number of Votes in their hands.<br/>-1) That is, the fee for the participation in the Election of the President is 40 resources, namely 10 Money resources, 10 People resources, 10 Connections resources and 10 Knowledge resources.<br/>2) Only Candidates for Presidency (that is, players who at the time of the announcement of the Election were in the Small Circle) may compete for the post of the President.<br/>After the announcement of the Election of the President, none of the players may go to the Small Circle and become a Candidate for Presidency.<br/>3) For example, if 4 people play and the 3rd (in a row from the First Player) player announces Election of the President, the 4th player goes after him/her, and the final round is played, that is, all players, starting with the First Player, make 1 more move (the last one). <br/>4) If, after counting the Votes, it turns out that several Candidates for Presidency gained the same number of Votes, more than others, another Game round is held (until one winner is determined).<br/><br/>Description of the Game Cells<br/><br/>1. START. The Game begins with this cell. There are 4 START cells, which are located in the 4 different Game sectors. During the Game, players will get to START cells of different sectors. Every time some player gets to the START cell, they gets 2 resources of the sector in which this cell is located (indicated on the cell).<br/>2. Award. The second cells of all sectors. Here players only get resources pictured on the cell, the number of which determined by the Dice.<br/>3. Chance. If the player gets to the Chance cell, the player takes the top card from the Chance deck, which lies on the Playing Field (on the specially marked spot), reads what it is written on the card and follows the instructions.<br/>The possibility to transfer the card to another player is indicated on the card. <br/>If, after using the Chance card, the player moved to another cell, the relevant instructions are followed. However, if the player is returned to the cell where they stood (i.e., the last move was canceled), the cell instructions are not executed. <br/>If the card cannot be used, then the player draws the next card.<br/>4. Exhibition, Meeting, Round Table and Training. The fourth cells of all sectors where players should skip the next move and, at the same time, receive the resources pictured on the cell, the number of which determined by the Dice.<br/>5. Forum Brings Resources. The fifth cell of all sectors, where players receive resources from other sectors. First, the player rolls the Dice to determine resource from which sector they will receive (counted from the next sector clockwise) and then they rolls the Dice again to find out the number of the resources they will receive.<br/>For example, a player, being in the Activist sector, gets to the Forum Brings Resources cell. To find out which resource they will receive, the player rolls the Dice for the first time. Let&rsquo;s say, the number 3 on the Dice, what means the 3rd sector clockwise from the Activist, that is, the Businessperson sector. This means that the player will receive Money resources, the number of which is determined by the second roll of the Dice.<br/>6. Raiders Attack Your Business, Your Organization Splits, Attestation, and Exam. The sixth cells of all sectors.<br/>The player should throw the Dice:<br/>- if the number is 1, 2 or 3 on the Dice - the player goes to the START cell of the sector in which they is and, accordingly, receives two resources which are pictured on the cell;<br/>- if the number is 4, 5 or 6 on the Dice - the player remains on the cell which they stands on. <br/>7. Go to Another Sector. The seventh cells of all sectors. The player may throw the Dice to determine the sector in which they will go to the START cell and receive corresponding 2 resources (counted from the next sector clockwise). To stay in place, the player has to pay the Treasury 1 pictured resource.<br/>For example, the player gets the Go to another sector cell of the Businessperson sector, where is offered a choice:<br/>1) Pay 1 resource (which is pictured) to stay on this cell and move to the Big Circle from the next move;<br/>2) Roll the Dice to go to the START of one of the sectors and receive 2 pictured resources.<br/>Suppose that the player decides to roll the Dice and gets 2. This means that the player must go to START on the second sector clockwise, namely the Public Official sector.<br/>8. Real Estate Market. There are 10 Real Estate Market cells in the Game, where players may buy and sell Real Estate.<br/>There are 2 types of Real Estate - Institutions and Investments.<br/>In Standard rules we only use Institutions.<br/>The player, who purchased an Institution, gets profit from its use if some other player gets to them, also they gets 1 resource of the color of the Institution for each turn that the payer started as the owner of the Institution. <br/>Real Estate may be profitably sold if the corresponding Chance card is drawn out.<br/>Before the Game starts, all Real Estate is stored in the Treasury.<br/>The Game has eight pairs of standard Institutions cards (Business Center, Hotel, Union of Activists, Society for the Ecology Protection, Institute of Expertise, Academy, Police, Tax Inspection) and additional ones - Oil Derrick. <br/>Real Estate Cards symbolize the 4 gaming sectors, as evidenced by their value, content and color (except for Oil Derrick).<br/>The Treasurer divides the Institutions cards into two identical decks, one of which is mixed and will be offered to the players if they get into the Real Estate Market cell, and the second is stored in the Treasury.<br/>All Real Estate cards have a Market Price and a Crisis Price, shown on the cards. Players have the right to make any Real Estate deals between themselves  (sell, buy, exchange, etc.).<br/>When a player is on the Real Estate Market cell, they chooses one of the options (the player cannot change the decision):<br/>- buy for the Market Price (build on this cell) 1 from 3 randomly drawn cards of Institution (If the player buys the Institution, then one card of the Institution is kept by the player, and the second card, stored in the second deck in the Treasury, is put on the Playing Field on the Real Estate Market cell on which the player stands, after what the cell becomes the cell of this Institution);<br/>- to sell one of its Real Estate for the Market Price to the Treasury (if the player is in their Institution, they may sell it by Market Price as well).<br/>- refuse the deal.<br/>Any player may sell any of their Real Estate at any time at the Crisis Price during their move.<br/>The player may sell/exchange their Real Estate on the general terms before purchasing a new Real Estate.<br/>Any player has the right to purchase any Real Estate, if it is offered by the Treasurer (if the player can afford it).<br/>The right to purchase the Real Estate cannot be transferred to another player, but later it is allowed to perform any operations with it (see the Gameplay item).<br/>The cardholder has the right to fully or partially release a player who came to their Institution from any card effect (for example, when a player must pay to the Treasury, go to Jail or make a speech), under any conditions (to agree with each other).  <br/>Once in some Institutions, the player should make a speech (to speak), after which the remaining players (listeners) must vote if they like this speech (raise one hand up for like):<br/>- if no one likes, the speaker receive nothing;<br/>- if the minority like (less than half or half of the listeners), the speaker receives 1 of the resource pictured on the card, from the Treasury;<br/>- if the majority like (more than half of the listeners), the speaker receives 2 of the resources pictured on the card, from the Treasury.<br/>! Exceptions from the general rule<br/>The Institution Police - may send the player who get this Institution for maximum 3 turns (how to read the Dice indicated on the Cover of the Rules and on the Bottom of the Game Box).<br/>The Institution Oil Derrick - the most expensive Real Estate in the Game, which gives the player the status of Oligarch as well the 3rd place. If there are playing less than 5 players, then a pair of the cards Oil Derrick is excluded from the Game (there will be no Oligarch in the Game). The Oil Derrich may be sold just to the Treasury just for the Crisis Price.<br/>9. Crisis. If the player get on the Crisis cell, they has to go to the START cell of the corresponding color (close to this Crisis cell) or pay 1 resource to the Treasury, which is pictured on the Crisis cell in order to stay in place.<br/>10. Speech on the Channel. This cell gives the player the opportunity to choose: to get Votes for themselves or to get these Votes for another player. The number of Votes is determined by the Dice.<br/>11. Debate. When a player gets to the Debate cell, they during 1 minute (use hourglass) draws cards (one by one, starting with the top) from the Debate deck (lies on the Playing Field), reads silently the term (word or phrase) and explains by any method this term to other players who have to guess it and say out loud.<br/>It is forbidden for the player (who explain the term) to say the term or any part of that it, or even speak the root word (even if other player already told it). Also, it is forbidden to show a card or point to an object denoting a term. The term must be guessed exactly as indicated on the card.<br/>Players will receive credit for guessing correctly when they say an exact translation of the term that is indicated on the card (for example, for the English word Tax other acceptable translations would be NALOG in Russian or PODATOK in Ukrainian). <br/>If the player guessed the term, but used word-for-word translation into another language (if the translation is not on the card), and this translation is accepted by most players as correct, it is believed that the player guessed correctly.<br/>If the term is guessed, the one who explained and the one who guessed will receive 1 Vote chip, and the used Debate card will be placed in a used discard pile.<br/>If several players correctly named the word at the same time, then (after the Debate), those players will each throw the Dice and a person with a highest number takes the Vote.<br/>After the term has been guessed, the player will draw another card and explain it as long as the hourglass still has time left.<br/>A player may continue explaining the last card (which he/she took before the minute expires) after the hourglass ends, on the other hand the player may throw the card into discard pile without a penalty.<br/>Fine. If the player violated the rules of explanation or could not explain the term and wants to go to the next card Debate - they must pay a fine of 1 Vote (other players don`t get Vote for this term). But it the time is up, then the player doesn&rsquo;t pay the fine and just finish the Debate. <br/>Because standard Debate cards has 6 words written and numbered in English, Russian, and Ukrainian, then the player throws the Dice  before the Debate starts to determine under what number they will explain the terms.<br/>For more Debates, players may increase the Debate time to 2 minutes and/or use 1 or 2 of the Real Estate Market cells as a Debate cell (to do this, put the card that symbolizes the Debate on the Real Estate Market cell).<br/>12. Hospital. Being on this cell, the player rolls the Dice:<br/>- if the number is from 1 to 3, the player is healthy (doesn`t pay);<br/>- if the number is from 4 to 6, the player must pay 2 of any resources at his/her discretion to the Treasury.<br/>13. Vacation and Resort. If the player gets to the Vacation cell, they places the pawn on the Resort cell near the center of the Playing Field. The number of moves that the player is to make to be on the Resort cell is determined by the Dice:<br/>- if the number is from 1 to 3 - the player remains on the Resort cell 1 move;<br/>- if the number is from 4 to 6 - the player remains on the Resort cell 2 moves.<br/>The exit from the Resort cell is made through the Vacation cell (the Vacation cell will be the first cell the player moves to; if number 1 is on the Dice and the player gets to the Vacation cell, the effect of the Vacation cell does not happen this time).<br/>If the player is on the Resort cell, they may get resources and perform Game operations, but not roll the Dice and move the pawn.<br/>14. Jail. The player may get to the Jail cell for 1-3 moves through the Police cell (see description of the Real Estate Market cell) or when they has nothing to pay (see the Out of Resources in the Gameplay item). If the player gets to the Jail cell, they puts their pawn on the Jail cell near the center of the Playing Field.<br/>The exit from the Jail cell is made through the Police cell, if some player has already built it (the cell Police will be the first cell of the player&rsquo;s move: if number 1 is on the Dice and the player stops on the Police cell, the effect of the Police cell does not come this time).<br/>If there is no Police cell, the player leaves the Jail through the closest clockwise Real Estate Market cell free of Institutions (if the number on the Dice is 1 and the player stopped on the Real Estate Market cell, the effect of the Real Estate Market cell does not come this time).<br/>15. Casino. On this cell, the player is to make a bet (only with resources) and roll the Dice, which defines the result:<br/>- if numbers 1 or 2 are on the Dice - the player loses their bet, which goes to the Treasury;<br/>- if numbers 3 or 4 are on the Dice - the player takes back their bet;<br/>- if numbers 5 or 6 is on the Dice - the player wins, and their bet doubles (the player takes the same resource as their bet from the Treasury).<br/>Players cannot take bets from other players as well share bets.<br/>16. Political Party. On this cell, a player may sell any number of Votes to the Treasury at the regular exchange rate (1 Vote = 2 of any resources at the player&rsquo;s choice). This is the only Game situation when players may sell Votes to the Treasury.<br/>17. The Beginning of the Campaign (as well the Debate cell). The player who gets to the Small Circle puts their pawn on this cell, which acts as a regular Debate cell (that is, after the switch to the Small Circle, the player immediately starts the Debate).<br/>18. Forced Auction. A player (Candidate for Presidency) who gets to this cell may force (order) any other player to sell one of their Real Estate for the Crisis Price (except for the Oil Derrick) to the person they points to (to another player, to themselves or to the Treasury). A player cannot be forced to buy Real Estate. The operation (transaction) occurs immediately, during this move.<br/>19. PR. On this cell, the player has the opportunity to get Votes for themself or remove (to the Treasury) another player&rsquo;s Votes. The number of Votes is determined by the Dice.<br/>20. Litigation. On this cell, the player decides what action to take: to get 1 Vote for themself or lose 2 of their Votes, so that the opponent is deprived of 3 Votes.<br/>21. Protest Action. On this cell, the player has the opportunity to take away Votes from another (at their discretion) player. The number of Votes is determined by the Dice.<br/><br/>MAKE THE GAME HARDER<br/><br/>1) Read the Dice as is pictured on the Cover of the Rules and on the Botton of the Game Box (every time when the Dice is pictured), specifically:<br/>- if the Dice indicates a 1 or a 2, it means 1 resource, 1 Vote or the player will move next (first) sector clockwise from the current position;<br/>- if the Dice indicates a 3 or a 4, it means 2 resources, 2 Votes or they will have to move second sector clockwise from the current position;<br/>- if the Dice indicates numbers 5 or 6, this means 3 resources or 3 Votes or they will need to move the third sector clockwise from the current position.<br/>For example: a player is and is in the Go To Another Sector cell in the Businessperson sector and they rolls the Dice. Suppose the number 3 or 4 shows on the Dice. This mean, that the player needs to move their pawn to the START in the second sector clockwise from their current position, which is the Public Official sector.<br/><br/>2) Add-on: Real Estate Investments - cheap Real Estate in the Game, which may be purchased on the Real Estate Market cell at the same conditions as Institutions (the player has to choose which type of Real Estate they want to see for purchasing).<br/>Investments give 1 resource of their color per turn and kept in the players hands (i.e. they are not placed on the Game Field).<br/>If players use Investments, then the Institutions gives 2 resources per turn.<br/><br/>3) Add-on: extra decks for Debate (for example Tough Debate deck - there are hard with explanation).<br/>If the player guesses the phrase, but changes the word order (for example, electoral system = system electoral), it is believed that the player guessed correctly.<br/><br/>",

Players must make strategic decisions every turn as they try to find advantage using a limited action economy.<br/><br/>Every turn repositions the tiles, and every action has ripple effects. Each player has a limited air supply that they must protect while maneuvering around the board. Players have the choice each turn for what actions to take. Actions include searching for treasure, shooing away a single Jellyfish, moving, expending air to shift an entire row of jellies, or recovering treasure. When players manage to recover a treasure in the game, they collect a physical treasure gem to add to their hoard.<br/><br/>The key event comes every turn as an increasing number of tiles are added to one side of the play area, and slid across. The sliding tiles push the furthest tiles off the game play surface, thus rearranging the board. The tiles are chose at random, but placed carefully. If a jelly stings a diver, they lose air. As they lose air, the number of tiles being added each turn increases.<br/><br/>In order to win, divers must recover 10 treasures first. However there is not always a winner. All players must search for treasure while keeping an eye on their air tank. If the air tank gauge reaches empty, their search is over.<br/><br/>",

The pitch is arranged into a grid of interlinking spaces (a centre spot and for each side 4 forward spots, 3 penalty spots and a 'goal' space).<br/><br/>Starting from the centre circle, one player rolls the blue Attacker die, while the opponent rolls the green Defender die. <br/>The Defender will take possession (and therefore become the Attacker) if the Attacker rolls 'pass' and the Defender rolls 'intercept', or if the Attacker rolls 'chip' and the Defender rolls 'head', or if the Attacker rolls 'dribble' and the Defender rolls 'tackle'.<br/><br/>If the Attacker manages to move the ball without interruption from the Defender to the penalty area, he/she can take a shot at goal using the red Striker die. The opponent gets a chance to block this shot using the black Goalie die.<br/><br/>Outcomes: Blue (Attack: pass, dribble, chip), Green (Defend: tackle, intercept, head), Red (Striker shoot: left, centre, right), Black (Goalie save: left, centre, right).<br/><br/>Big Match is a light &quot;stocking filler&quot; game and comes with a small felt bag to hold the components.

The cars race through city streets obeying basic traffic laws such as driving on the right, not stopping in the middle of intersections etc. In conjunction with each die-roll a card must be revealed which tells the player how they can move (or cannot). There's a no-overtake zone where cars in front may not be passed, and in general no two vehicles can land in the same space.<br/><br/>The idea is to pick up two tokens matching your car colour at the two time-control zones marked with clocks, then be the first to cross the finish line to be the winner.<br/><br/>",

He is taken undersea to Ryugu palace and is entertained by the Princess Otohime for several days. But when he returns to his home, he has been gone 300 years. When Taro opens a gift box Otohime gave him, he suddenly ages.<br/><br/>In the game, it is his grandson Urashima who returns to do battle with Otohime, in anger that his grandfather's life was wasted away.<br/><br/>One player is Urashima, trying to reach and defeat the other player who is Otohime. She has laid out a path of various creatures to defend her, alongside possible traps or treasures. The attacking player must defeat the creatures before combatting the princess. Players and creatures have their hit points (HP) shown by dice, which the adjust up and down.<br/><br/>Otohime takes one white die for HPs and the red die for combat. Urashima takes two white dice for his HP(max 12) amd the green die for combat. Urashima starts with a treasure card, an Onigiri (rice ball) which will restore hit points by rolling his green die once.<br/><br/>Otohime lays out a path of hidden cards, 5 monsters with 5 treasures, face-down in which ever order she likes. The first card is turned up and the fight begins. The players roll their green and red dice, and the difference is taken as damage. If green is higher, the monster is hurt; if red is higher, Urashima is hurt; if the dice are the same, the monster is restored to full HP.<br/><br/>After one attack, Urashima can choose another attack, or to run away. He loses 1 HP, and cannot look at the treasure card, but moves on to the next creature.<br/><br/>If he defeats the creature, he can look at the treasure. This might be a bonus weapon, or nothing, or a trap. The cards all have a little Japanese text, but the icons and images are very obvious and clear.<br/><br/>If Urashima can get to Tohime and knock her down, he wins. If Otohime or her creatures knock Urashima down, she wins.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

It is a peculiar card game about crypto communication, people reading, and card counting.<br/><br/>2 to 4 teams of 2-players each (which means the game is played by either 4, 6, or 8 players) compete against each other to solve the assassination of His Excellency The Honorable Robin Poor IX, who is the sovereign cock of the Avian Kingdom. On the verge of chaos, the kingdom invites independent agencies to solve the murder before the whole world topples into an Animal World War! No pressure...<br/><br/>The game is loosely inspired by the English nursery rhyme Who Killed Cock Robin&ndash;&ndash; especially the Henry Louis Stephens&rsquo; 1865 book version which is named Death and Burial of Poor Cock Robin.<br/><br/>TEAMS<br/><br/>DOGLAND YARD (easy-to-play) The first team to arrive at the crime scene is Charlotte Holmes and Vet. Watson from the Dogland Yard. Charlotte Holmes is a petite lady of a stark demeanor. Her intelligence is the envy of many male colleagues. Vet. Watson (both a veteran and a veterinarian, so, we might as well call him Vet. Vet. Watson) is a frequently drunk, hulky, aloof, yet loveable medic. His accessory is a small barrel of whiskey that he carries around.<br/><br/>S&Ucirc;RET&Eacute; FELINATIONALE (easy-to-play) From across the channel arrive the inspectors of S&ucirc;ret&eacute; Felinationale. Being the catastrophe magnet he is, after Inspector Purrouseau has crossed the border, the country declared a celebration, hoping that the murder will never be resolved. Queen Kat&rsquo;O is a cross-dressing tomcat with questionable garderobe and bedfellows. Yet his skills in Paw Fu and Pawate stop anyone from further inquiries.<br/><br/>FBI (FEDERAL BEAVERS OF INVESTIGATION) (easy-to-play) From across the ocean arrive the agents of Federal Beavers of Investigation (FBI, for short). Originally a fox, Agent Murder has been raised by beavers after his family has been abducted by &quot;a strange light in the sky.&quot; Agent Scurry is a pedantic skeptic of almost everything. Her famous quote is &quot;What does the Fox say?&quot;<br/><br/>28th JANISSARY BRIGADE (moderate-to-play) Sailing from the Middle Sea, the ases of the 28th Janissary Brigade arrive at the scene of the crime. Originally from the Avian Kingdom, Hatun Rolexana was kidnapped into the harem when she was young. She seeks to capture the attention of the Sultan by solving this crime and earn a name change to H&uuml;rrem. Leading the bugs of the palace, Captain G&uuml;rgzadeh can sniff out clues better than anybody else. But really, in his heart, he is a lupus of mus&icirc;ki.<br/><br/>SPRING AND AUTUMN MAGISTRATES (moderate-to-play) From the faraway lands in the East, the territory of the dragon takes notice of this mysterious murder. Daughter of a criminal mastermind, Lin Tang is using her intelligence and resources to fight crime. One day, she hopes to face her arch-enemy, her father, Phu Manchu. Before traveling to the Avian Kingdom, she enlists the help of Charlie Phan, a renowned detective who immigrated to the Island of the Volcano a long time ago.<br/><br/>ZOOKHRANA (hard-to-play) From the snowy lands of the north, the men of Zookhrana arrive with their coats and vodka. Bearis Akunin is a crime author who turned into a detective. He enjoys criminal cases that have twist endings. Perseus is a mysterious and silent spy with a hidden identity. He (or she?) is cunning, intelligent, deadly, and a little megalomaniacal. (I mean, really, who calls themselves a &ldquo;project?&rdquo;)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Assault Tactics - Fall of the White Eagle is a dynamic wargame for up to four players focusing on tactical man to man and vehicle to vehicle combat during the German invasion of Poland in 1939, better known as Case White. The goal is to create a well balanced, atmospheric and realistic experience of combat. To increase the fun and replayability several game mechanics have been added and in a few cases playabilty trumped the call for realism.<br/><br/>As a player you have to make multiple decisions in a heartbeat: Do I want to have more of a mobile or rather static force? Which weapons will my soldiers use, which further equipment do they bring to the battlefield? Shall I rely on battle hardened veterans or rookies that have not seen any action on the field yet? Do I salvage enemy weapons or solely rely on my own?<br/><br/>This game is meant to be the start of a whole series covering all the decisive battlegrounds of WW2. It is heavily inspired by well known computer games, cosims and tabletop systems. For Tankette Publishing it is the first game released.<br/><br/>",

The major and minor ranks both follow the one 1, two 2s, three 3s... structure.  However, the combinations are structured such that the 1 occurs on 2 cards (1-10 and 10-1), while the 10 occurs on 19 cards (10-10 through 10-1, and 1-10 through 10-10).

If the major ranks of the first 2 cards match, then subsequent players may only play a card with that major rank.  If the minor ranks of the first 2 cards match, then subsequent players may only play a card with that minor rank.<br/><br/>However, if the first and second card share neither the same major or minor rank, then all subsequent cards can match no previously played cards' major or minor ranks.<br/><br/>Players earn 1 point per trick taken, and the game lasts a number of rounds equal to the players.

With technological advances, and the discovery of a super fuel called Tyridium, remotely controlled robots no bigger than a child (and in most cases smaller) are able to perform the tasks of armies of men.<br/><br/>This game simulates the militaristic side of the robots use &ndash; in attempts to destroy opponents and secure resource rich environments of newly discovered worlds orbiting distant star systems.<br/><br/>With an innovative system of 3-D Blast templates that gradually reduce in size, TiRoBEx takes wargaming to a whole new level - a really, really low down level. The complete rules and printable versions of the templates and tokens are contained within a single full-colour rulebook.<br/><br/>Each 'Tiny Robot System' (TRS) has a unique reference card with values for various attributes that you can alter during the game. Tyridium (like an individual energy store) can be allocated to many different systems; Movement, Range of Attack, Number of Attacks, Accuracy, Shield Generation, Evasion capabilities, or to power-up the devastating Area Impact (AI) Rounds. All this in an attempt to destroy your opponent(s) and secure unrefined Tyridium around the battlefield.<br/><br/>The main TiRoBEx rulebook contains full rules for eight different TRS, from four of the largest factions in the future of humankind as they explore the vast reaches of the cosmos, in a bid to claim the Tyridium scattered throughout the stars for themselves.<br/><br/>They may be small, but they can have a BIG impact!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player then starts their turn with the draw phase then the summoning phase then the end phase <br/>2(a). during the draw phase the player draws one card from the top of their deck <br/>2(b.) during the summoning phase players may summon up to four creatures at a time on the field and may cast two spells per turn <br/>2(c). during the end phase players may attack the opponent sanity or their creatures and the effect of spells take place<br/>3. A player may take damage to their sanity when a spell is cast on them or a creature attacks them<br/>4. The game ends when one player has run out of sanity and is now mad<br/>Special rule: in order to summon larger creatures such as great old ones or outer gods a sacrifice is needed: for a Great Old One two lesser creatures must be sacrificed and for an Outer God two Great old Ones( or equivalent ) must be sacrificed.

MYFAKEBAND is a hilarious game that allows you to be the creator of some epically ridiculous bands, putting out equally cringeworthy hit singles.<br/><br/>How to play: The person in the group who most recently sang karaoke, will become the first &ldquo;Founding Member.&rdquo; Or, the person in the group who most recently purchased music or concert tickets will become the first &ldquo;Founding Member.&rdquo; (SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL MUSICIANS!)<br/><br/>The Founding Member draws 1 card from the &ldquo;My Fake Band&rdquo; deck and 1 card from the &ldquo;Genre&rdquo; deck. The Founding Member then reads the name and genre of their new fake band to the group. Each player in the group, including the founding member, will create &amp; write down the song title of the Fake Band&rsquo;s first hit single. Answers are passed back to the founding member face down.<br/><br/>All of the song titles- including the one written by the founding member- will be read out loud to the group, twice.<br/>The first player up will try and match a song title to the correct author. When a match is made, the player who wrote that song title is eliminated from the round. Play continues until the current player guesses incorrectly. With an incorrect match, the mic passes clockwise to the next player, gameplay resumes. Gameplay continues until only 1 player remains or the mic makes it back to the founding member.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>1 point for each correct match (Not including guessing their own)<br/>2 bonus points if a player completes all matches in one turn<br/>4 points for the founding member if no correct matches are made before the mic makes it back to the founding member<br/><br/><br/>        The player with the most points after 3 rounds wins<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

They were posted there by the Duke of Wellington who saw the solid building as an anchor to his left flank and vital communication line to his Prussian allies. As the rain poured down, cold and wet soldiers did what all soldiers do &ndash; they smashed down the large gates of the barn to build a fire, little thinking that in six hours they would desperately need those gates...<br/><br/>The epic struggle at La Haye Sainte is now the stuff of legend, with its small, but regularly reinforced garrison of green-clad rifleman of the King&rsquo;s German Legion and their allies clinging on grimly against massed French infantry assaults.<br/><br/>Finally, with the riflemens&rsquo; ammunition spent, Marshall Ney ordered one more frenzied assault and this time, with Engineers led by Lieutenant Vieux swinging axes and crowbars, the French drove through the main gate. Bayonets and swords were freely used, in savage hand-to-hand fighting. By early evening the farm was in French hands and the loss of the farm keenly felt by the Allied forces. The overwhelming arrival of Bl&uuml;cher&rsquo;s Prussian forces won the day for Wellington&rsquo;s hard-pressed men who then reoccupied the battered remains, but the struggle for this key building will be remembered for eternity.<br/><br/>You can now recreate this epic struggle with this superb battle-set. <br/>Will your brave German defenders be able to stave off the massed enemy assaults? <br/>Will your proud French troops be able to drive the Allies from this vital strongpoint and threaten Wellington&rsquo;s flank?<br/>Only time will tell...<br/><br/>La Haye Sainte contains:<br/><br/>Laser-cut wooden farmhouse, out-buildings, walls and pond including construction guides and acetate windows<br/>    Laser-cut wooden tables and chairs &ndash; use as firing steps<br/>    Two laser-cut wooden carts and plough (barricade)<br/>    Six metal branches to form an abatis<br/>    Major Von Baring, King&rsquo;s German Legion 2nd Light Battalion (exclusive metal figure)<br/>    15 metal King&rsquo;s German Legion 2nd Light Battalion with rifles and muskets<br/>    5 King&rsquo;s German Legion light infantry<br/>    36 French Light Infantry (30 plastic and 6 metal) including full-colour flag sheet and waterslide decals<br/>    Lieutenant Vieux (exclusive metal figure) and five metal French Engineers with muskets or tools<br/>    12-page scenario booklet<br/><br/>Note: There is a collector's edition of this that also comes with:<br/><br/>1 resin sandpit<br/>    Metal farmer's wife tending young calf<br/>    Resin pile of dead Frenchmen<br/>    6 metal French Voltigeurs skirmishing<br/>    Marshall Ney shouting at brigade commander<br/>    4 metal French casualties<br/>    Mounted French Officer<br/>    36 French Infantry (6 metal command and 30 plastic infantry)<br/>    6 Luneberg Light Infantry<br/>    6x 95th Rifles<br/>    1 British Rocketeer and a horse.<br/>    1 Nassau officer using cooking pot to extinguish the barn fire<br/>    6 metal Nassau infantry<br/>    36 Hanoverian Line Infantry (6 metal command, 30 plastic infantry)<br/>    Sprue of abatis stakes and branches (metal)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's site<br/><br/>",

The player that ends their turn on 99 points (or more) loses the round and surrenders a token; those with no tokens left are out of the game.

The object is to be the first player to eliminate all of your cards by matching cards and dice. Each player is dealt 8 cards face up. The remaining cards are stacked face down in the center of the table to form the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned face up and placed next to the draw pile to form the match pile. Each player will then try to get rid of as many cards as possible by matching the numbers on the cards with the numbers on the dice they roll.

        "description": "4 hearts together. 4 pieces in each. 4 of all are different. 4 decades of combinations. In short everything is related to the number 4.<br/>    Game-play is based on a special shape resulting from combining 4 hearts. The way the hearts are merged makes each divided in 4 pieces. The whole shape has 9 pieces in total instead of 16 as some are common for two or more hearts.<br/>    A 'quad' is the shape described above with any 4 pieces ('qarts') marked in contrasting colour. According this quads can be divided in two groups (sides): light ('glim') quads if qarts are darker than other parts (as the 4 of qarts is always the minority) and dark ('grim') quads if vice versa. Each qart has value in points depending on the number of hearts it is common for. So it can be 2, 4 pts for glims, -2, -4 for grims and 0 for both. Changing qarts order gives 20 meaningfully distinctive combinations for each side, 40 quads in total. Quads in a side are rank-ordered. The overall ranking follows the qarts configuration (all qarts in one heart is the best) and is subdivided in two dimensions: vertical (4 'piles') and horisontal ('atop' 0-4 according the number of quads above). The priority between sides can be set by game rules and vary in playing progress.<br/>    The system can provide new experience in randomising, solitaire, card and dice playing as well as refresh many traditional games.<br/><br/>",

Between matches they visit the Court to gain new items or mounts, gain favors from nobles such as the King and Queen, mingle with nobles to increase their reputation, or gain additional training for their knight and squires.<br/><br/>During the Court Phase players place their knights and squires within the Royal Court. Squires spend gold to purchase items for their knights while the knights use their reputation to gain them. Players can build their decks at the &quot;Training Grounds&quot; to be used in the Joust phase.<br/><br/>During the Joust Phase players will compete against their opponent using their decks. Items gained or purchased in the Court Phase can be used during the joust to aid the knights. There are four passes within each joust. During a pass each player strategically plays three different cards from their hand consisting of the &quot;Herald&quot;, the &quot;Shield&quot;, and the &quot;Levee&quot;. Knights start with 10 stamina which they spend to play cards from their hand and lose it when they are hit by their opponent's &quot;Levee&quot;. If a knight's stamina reaches 0, they are unhorsed and can decide to remount if they still have a chance at victory. The first knight to score 10 points by the end of the fourth pass gains a victory token, gold, and reputation.<br/><br/>At the end of the seventh day, players combine their victory point total based on their cards, victory tokens, and reputation points. The player with the most points wins the tournament!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player represents a different religion/cult that is trying to spread across the globe.<br/><br/>Gameplay is simple but strategy is deep and luck is not a factor. Players, on their turns, can take one action (move pieces, produce more pieces, convert an area to their religion, or slaughter pieces).<br/><br/>Each player also has 4 miracle cards that they can use to their advantage (each god has its own unique set of 6 miracle cards to choose from).<br/><br/>Game can end in 2 ways:<br/>If a player places 10 temple cubes/controls 10 areas on the board (8 in a 3p game), that player wins immediately.<br/><br/>If every area on the board has a temple on it, the game ends immediately. The player with the most temples on the board wins. If a 3 player game ends this way and 2 players are tied for most temples, remove the losing's players temples and the 2 players that were tied for first continue to play until one of them places 10 temples.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tricon is a pure connection game for 3 players (one and only one player will connect and therefore win).<br/><br/>The game is played on a triangular board with 21 dots each of three different colors, one color for each player. These dots are laid laid out to form a triangular grid play area, which has one dot of each color for each triangle play location. There is a black dot (6 total) in each corner and the middle of each side of the triangular board, which identify non-playable locations. When the game starts, 4 dots of the same color (two sets for each color) are already connected as a three link line along the outside edges of the triangle game board. The goal is to create a path in your color that connects your two initial lines on two different sides of the triangle game board.<br/><br/>Players take turns connecting two dots of their color. Each turn the active player chooses an empty triangle play area. Then, they draw a line from the point of their color through the opposing side of the chosen triangle. If the next triangle is not empty there is only one possibility to leave it. The player's line continues in that direction and may go through several non-empty triangles. As soon as the line comes to an empty triangle play area it ends on the opposing point, which is the active player's color. Note: A move that would go through a triangle containing a black dot is forbidden.<br/><br/>A player wins if they connect their two initially filled in lines along two sides of the triangle game board.<br/><br/>",

The King ordered all the other alchemists&nbsp;to share their own Ingredients and findings with the Royal Alchemist to help each others&rsquo; progress.&nbsp;However, wanting to be the future and only Grand Alchemist, you will secretly sabotage the other alchemists using powerful spells while avoiding punishments from the King.&nbsp;Who will rise to the top to become the Grand Alchemist?<br/><br/>In the beginning, each player is dealt 1 Sabotage card which can be played an unlimited number of times and an assortment of Ingredients or Spells. Each round, a player has the chance to bear the Royal Emblem. The Royal Emblem denotes the Royal Alchemist, and all other players are instructed to give one ingredient to the Royal Alchemist. However, you can choose to sabotage by playing the Sabotage card or a Spell instead. As all the cards are played face down, nobody knows what anyone else is playing. The Royal Alchemist reveals all the cards and determines the fate accordingly. <br/>There are 3 possible scenarios:<br/><br/>     If half or more than half of the cards played are Ingredients: The Royal Alchemist collects all the Ingredients played and the spells will be cast.<br/>     If less than half of the cards played are Ingredients: The Royal Alchemist collects all Ingredients played and players who played Spells or Sabotage cards must instead give the Royal Alchemist any 2 cards from their hand. Spells will continue to be cast.<br/>     If all cards played are Ingredients: All Ingredients played are discarded instead.<br/><br/><br/>During each round, players have the choice of depositing ingredients in their cauldron. Once in the cauldron, these ingredients cannot be returned to your hand. The first player to hold the Royal Emblem and have 10 or more ingredients of at least 6 different types in their cauldron wins the game. Alternatively, any player to collect 7 of the same ingredients in their cauldron instantly wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Senate the Argument Game, you are a senator in the esteemed Roman senate. Think up the most mischievous Propositions for your peers to act out. But be careful, arguing and getting your way in the Senate requires quick wit and strategy.<br/><br/>As any good senator, you must use your Influence to acquire new arguments on the start of every round. The goal is to end up as on the winning team at the end of the round by Objecting arguments or Supporting those who are already winning. The round starts when a Senator makes a Proposition and ends when the senator who started the round plays their eighth turn. Everyone on the losing team must then act out the Proposition. The game ends when every senator has had the chance to make one Proposition.<br/><br/>Members of the winning and losing teams switch frequently throughout the round and Influence keeps changing hands due to yours and other senators' actions, so manage your arguments well. Betrayal, deception, and even begging - everything goes when reputations are at stake.<br/><br/>description from designer<br/><br/>",

Meanwhile, entertainment demands are at an all-time high.<br/><br/>A child of these strange times, FORTUNE OF THE FORGOTTEN WORLD is the highest rated show in history. Located on Island 17A, a scientific experiment gone awry, the television show offers contestants a chance to find a veritable fortune in cash that is stashed on the island, locate the hidden raft and escape to safety, all the while fighting and running from dinosaurs, collecting useful items, fending off other contestants, and competing for the best ratings with the television audience.<br/><br/>YOU are one of this season&rsquo;s contestants, having survived a rigorous screening process that includes a paleontologist, an engineer, a soldier, a trail guide, a cook, a medical doctor, a professional athlete, and a popular celebrity. Can you outwit the competition, survive combat with history&rsquo;s deadliest predators, puzzle out the island&rsquo;s technology all to recover the hidden stash of cash and escape with your life?<br/><br/>Gameplay involves players &quot;landing&quot; on the island by placing their tokens on the hex board, and then rolling dice to move around, revealing tiles that they encounter along the way. Tiles might be useful items such as weapons, health packs, or tools -- or they could be wild dinosaurs which force players to evade or battle them. Only one tile is the sought-after prize money. Once the money is found, players must race to find the raft off of the island, which may lie beyond gates that must be powered on and unlocked. Will you prepare a route to safety before you search for the prize money? Establish choke points to steal the money from other players? Scour the island for the prize money in hopes that you don't encounter a deadly dinosaur instead? Your decisions affect how the TV audience perceives you. Unpopular players may get &quot;fired&quot;, while popular ones will be rewarded by studio executives. Random events may interfere with your strategy, so always have a contingency plan and don't forget about your character's unique skills!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They can choose to add another loaded card to 2nd Base, or they can choose to replace an existing card (loaded card OR base card).<br/><br/>Players continue to add cards, earning singles, doubles, and triples, depending on the number of loaded cards in play. Once there are four loaded cards, one player can attempt to hit a &quot;grand slam&quot; by sharing an answer that incorporates all 4 loaded cards! Once the grand slam is awarded, players will tally their total points from all of their &quot;hits&quot;, and take note of their score for that inning. After a set number of innings, players will calculate their total scores to determine the winner of the game!<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players can lose points by calling out incorrect answers (strikes) or by placing nonsensical cards on their own turn (outs). Strikes and outs cause you to lose varying amounts of points, depending on how many cards are in play! However, players will have two abilities (curve-balls and splitters) to help them get out of a tight spot.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In the middle of the jungle, during a recon mission in a misty valley, a squad of soldiers of the Delta Sierra company comes face to face with dinosaurs from a bygone age.<br/>A savage battle ensues on a terrain full of traps and hazards, where everyone must fight to survive.<br/><br/>One player leads a squad of soldiers and the other plays the dinosaurs. One group plays strategically while the other is more primitive in its tactics. The game ends when all soldiers or dinosaurs are eliminated.<br/><br/>First, you choose or create your teams. Then, each player draws and places terrain tiles, face down, one after the other, trying to create a playing field to their advantage.<br/>After that, the players discover the field while fighting each other. Movement, placement and distance determine if a unit can be killed. Soldiers can attack from afar, while dinos can only do so up close and personal. Special abilities give each unit a tactical value and allow for elaborate strategies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Some of the players are secretly loyal to the Illuminati, and will sabotage these missions when it is strategically sound to do so. The Illuminati know one another, while the rest of the players are left in the dark.<br/><br/>The game is divided into years. The Lodge sends out missions in January, April, September, and November. In December, the Factory owners elect a new Alderman, who has minimal power.<br/>Every June the Lodge will elect new officers who will be responsible for assigning the committees that go out on these missions. The Secretary will select where these committees will go (from limited options presented to him), and the Worshipful Master will nominate a committee to send. If the Lodge consents, that committee will go, and their actions will determine the loyalty of that city. Some cities will be visited more than once over the course of the campaign.<br/><br/>After four years (sixteen missions), check for the following endgame conditions:<br/><br/>     All eight cities have picked a side of this fateful conflict<br/>     Six or more cities are on the same side<br/><br/><br/>If both conditions are met, the game ends, and the team with majority control wins.<br/>If either of the conditions is not met, then the game continues one more year.<br/>At the end of that final round, if neither side has six cities, the Elector, Karl Theodor, will outlaw both the Illuminati and Freemasonry, and the Rosicrucian wins alone.<br/><br/>In addition to your secret roles (Loyalist/Illuminati/Rosicrucian), players are given public roles which limit when they can travel, limit the travel of others, allow them to learn the loyalty of another player, or allow them to manipulate committees before they begin their missions.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.<br/><br/>Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.<br/><br/>Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value. If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on. This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.<br/><br/>The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players. The victory goal of each scenario can vary from king of the hill, to enemy elimination, to just about any combat scenario victory condition one could imagine.<br/><br/>",

It is just a 4 page book.<br/><br/>Incorporating three levels of play, Mein Panzer Junior can be played by children as young as 5 years old, or upwards of 12 years old or more.<br/><br/>Level One introduces youngsters to the basic fundamentals of wargaming, using only a single d6 per player and a common 6&quot;  or 12&quot; ruler. Resolution of movement and shooting is simple  and easily accomplished by the youngest players on a tank by tank basis.<br/><br/>Level Two expands upon the previous level slightly by adding  Tank  Units and the concept of &ldquo;hits&rdquo; and &ldquo;kills&rdquo;. Play is still extremely simple with only a few additional rules.<br/><br/>Level Three is almost a full featured game including game turns and distinction between the different types of tanks.  At this level, players must be able to perform simple subtraction relatively quickly to maintain a smooth, and interesting, game.<br/><br/>",

The game is over when all but one player delivers all of his drums. The remaining player, with drums in his possession at the end of the game, pays twice the fee for disposal . Everyone counts the cash they have left and the player with the most cash wins. Just like real life!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>The game takes a somewhat cynical view of toxic waste disposal, offering players the choice between legal handling of the waste and illegal actions such as violating truck weight limits and illegal dumping. But such actions carry the chance of significant penalties if taken.<br/><br/>Players have movers in the shape of flatbed trucks on which they carry the toxic waste drums.  They move along spaces on the large vinyl mat, some of which offer services, such as fuel.  These spaces may be bought and then earn income for the buyer as in Monopoly.<br/><br/>The game comes in a large cylindrical metal can, labelled to look like a toxic waste drum.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Welcome to a world of total warfare. Your wizards used to be powerful enough to hold your enemies at bay, but ever since the monks discovered the power contained in The Six Great Temples, everything has fallen to chaos, and none of your industrial weapons can restore peace to your lands. Your only hope for survival rests in forbidden and forgotten magic: To save your people from extinction, you must harness the power of the four elements and awaken the protector of Eden.&quot;<br/><br/>Titans Of Eden is a fast-paced deck-building card game for 2-6 players. Each player starts with a deck of basic cards, and has to choose each turn whether they want to play powerful cards to battle their opponents, or energy-granting cards that add elemental cards to their deck for future turns.<br/><br/>There are four main elements in Eden, and the strategies and abilities of each element are strong against one other element. This leads to fundamentally balanced gameplay: For example, if your opponent is going hard on an Ice strategy, you can use Fire cards to neutralize their cards and counter their moves. To do well in Titans Of Eden, you must build a balanced deck that can effectively respond to your opponents' actions.<br/><br/>At the end of each turn, you battle your opponents. Once you destroy their three temples, you win the game. With this victory condition, you have to play to win, every turn, because you're never more than 3 turns from victory, and never more than three turns from defeat.<br/><br/>Titans Of Eden includes a classic (Dominion-style) deck-building format for casual play, and a constructed format for competitive play. In the constructed format, each player builds a spellbook before playing, which they use to take on their opponents.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They can be played as stand alone battles or sequentially with each impacting n the next.<br/><br/>The Grand Duchy of Lorraine and the Vereinigte Freie St&auml;dte (VFS) are long term adversaries. The Lorraine Forces are modelled on those of France with not dissimilar uniforms, while the VFS - the United Free Provinces - are a fairly tight agglomeration of small principalities, republics, city states and so on, united to oppose Lorraine. The VFS uniforms, inspired by a number of European armies, provide a colourful contrast to the white of Lorraine.<br/><br/>This action takes place in a fairly remote northern area of the border between the two adversaries, the line of demarcation being the River Kneller. On the Lorraine side of the border, to the south, is the small province of St.Michel which unknowingly is about to become the focus of enemy operations.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Each player selects a player piece. All players then place their player piece on the cash point square of the outta section of the game board. All players roll the dice, the player with the highest dice roll is the Banker, who distributes assets from the Bank to the players. Each player is given 3,000 in cash divided as follows: two 500s, ten 100s, ten 50s and twenty five 20s. All remaining cash and other equipment go to the Bank.<br/><br/>General<br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn, the player roll the dice and move his/her player piece forward the number of spaces as rolled on the dice. If the player owns any Shows or Props, they can move these between their owned bars during their turn.<br/>If the player lands on an unowned bar, the player may buy it for the price listed on that bar&rsquo;s space. The money is given to the Bank in exchange for the Property Acquired Card for that premises. Shows can be purchased immediately and added to the premies, increasing its earn when visited. Props can be added when a player owns 2 properties next to each other and Hotel Deals can be purchased when a player owns 4 properties in the same district (colour).<br/>When players land on a property owned by another player, they must pay the player the amount stated on the Property Acquired Card including extra charges if the premises has Shows or Hotel Deal added.<br/>If the player lands on his or her own property, nothing happens.<br/>When players land on Lotto spaces they must contribute 100 Benidorm Bucks to the prize pool in the centre of the board, any fines, the money will be also added to this prize pool.<br/>When players land on Jager spaces, they must draw a card from the Power of Jager Deck, this will either have good or bad consequences.<br/>If the player is sent to &lsquo;The Beach&rsquo; to sleep it off, they must roll above a 6 to wake up and continue playing, unless they have an &lsquo;Energy Drink&rsquo; card to play.<br/>If the player lands on &lsquo;The Beach&rsquo; space, he or she is &ldquo;Just Passing Through&rdquo;. No penalty applies.<br/>If the player lands on the &lsquo;Spin Out&rsquo;, he or she must move his Player Piece directly to &lsquo;The Beach&rsquo;.<br/>Every time a player passes a Cash Point they collect 200 Benidorm Bucks from the Banker.<br/>You may sell Shows or Props back to the Bank for the full purchase price or sell properties to other players via mutual agreement at any point during the game.<br/>Players can loan other players money and make agreements during the game.<br/>Doubles<br/>When doubles are rolled, the player gets to play again during the same turn.<br/><br/>The Beach<br/>If instructed to &lsquo;Go to the Beach to sleep it off&rsquo; via either landing on the space stating that or drawing a Jager Card with that instruction, the player must enter the beach and roll above a 6 to continue playing, they can try once per turn.<br/><br/>Whilst passed out on the beach, if other players enter &lsquo;The Beach&rsquo;, just passing through, they can challenge the player for a bar of their choice, each, and the higher roller wins both bars.<br/><br/>Lotto<br/>Ant ime a player lands on a Lotto space, they must pay 100 Benidorm bucks to the Prize Pool in the center of the game board.<br/><br/>Bottom Line<br/>Each turn, try to foresee where players will land after your turn to maximise income and bankrupt your competitors.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Wolfenb&uuml;ttel War concerns the hostilities of Charles&rsquo; two fictitious mid-eighteenth century combatants, the Grand Duchy of Lorraine and the Vereinigte Freie St&auml;dte (VFS). The scenarios are applicable to any horse and musket period with little modification.<br/><br/>Where this mini-campaign differs from its predecessors (Raid on St.Michel, The Annexation of Chiraz) is that it is loosely based on a real campaign &ndash; that of the Hundred Days, culminating at Waterloo. The four scenarios and the movements between them are drawn from the battles of Quatre Bras, Ligny, Wavre and Waterloo. However, while the campaign sequence is followed the outcome is far from certain.<br/><br/>The book provides the fictitious background to the war, planning details including the selection of forces, the instructions for each army, table top maps and orders for each side. There are instructions for the game organiser and options for forces in each battle if fought as a stand alone wargame. The book is illustrated with photographs of each battle as it was fought with Charles&rsquo; armies. Newspapers and a Who&rsquo;s Who, not to mention the Ballroom scene, add colour to the story of the Wolfenb&uuml;ttel War.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to reach all of your destinations whilst collecting as much cargo as you can along the way. There will be many challenges to overcome.<br/><br/>To travel through the void unmarked by hardship is a fool&rsquo;s dream. The system is filled with pirates, mutants, endless bureaucracy, and &mdash;worst of all&mdash; other merchants.<br/><br/>A keen mind can turn the tide. Just remember, even for the saltiest of captains, Lady Luck can be quite fickle.<br/><br/>Merchants of Sol is a game for 2-6 players age 12+. Gameplay averages out to about 20-30 minutes per player. A key element of the game is its narration. As you draw cards to determine your fate, each destination and event has an exciting blend of story and facts about our solar system including the planets, dwarf planets, and moons that fill it.<br/><br/>Unique design and simple mechanics involving subtle strategy ensure a wonderfully balanced play experience. Every play session will be different as there are multiple paths to victory.

Players draw and play chits, the interaction between them outlines who can move and engage with their units. When all units in the game have moved and/or performed a combat action, or both Players consecutively PASS the turn ends. Combat is instantaneous.<br/><br/>Engage &amp; Destroy combat situations are presented in near-historical context, which balance resources and capabilities between the players making the game contest of skill rather than a match between unbalanced order of battles, allowing the game to portray period type engagements in a skill contest format.<br/><br/>There are three types of games in Engage &amp; Destroy:<br/><br/>     Meeting Engagements - players must take and hold locations, gaining more points than their opponent before the game ends,<br/>     Assault - one player must push a defender back behind a series of defense lines before the game ends,<br/>     Firefight - In Arena, it&rsquo;s a pure shoot out, with the player who earns the most &ldquo;kill&rdquo; points winning by game&rsquo;s end. <br/><br/><br/>Scale:<br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Time Scale: 2 minutes/turn<br/>Map Scale: 175 metres per hex<br/>Unit Scale: Single Vehicle or Team<br/>Players: 2<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Playing Time: 1 to 4 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Looking at the Seven Years War, military historians tend to concentrate on the big battles. However, the day to day campaign activity of the combatants included reconnaissance, raids, probing actions, resupply and a host of other minor operations that frequently lead to small skirmishes.<br/><br/>What I want to do in this volume of Refighting History is to take some of these actions, however small, and however sketchy in terms of accounts, and turn them into wargames. They will also demonstrate that you do not need large armies to wargame the Seven Years War.<br/>The Western Theatre accounts provide details of the day to day activity by both armies. Coupled with this, the great variety of light and irregular troops provides a whole range of different unit.<br/><br/>The result is this volume with nine small historical actions refought on the wargame table. There is also a significant amount of background on the units involved coupled with art work to illustrate the uniforms.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>The scenarios are compatible with many rulesets although Sharp Practice ! is recommended by the author (who uses his own modifications of his set The War Game Rules).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Having covered some relatively small actions in Volume 1 of Refighting History Volume 2 examines some larger battles. The battles in question come from the War of the Austrian Succession and more specifically the First Silesian War.<br/><br/>The first battle is something of a wargame classic - Mollwitz. The Grant&rsquo;s first Mollwitz wargame is coved with an excerpt from The War Game describing how it was first fought back in 1968. The battle is then revisited and with quite different results. There is then &ldquo;A slice of Mollwitz&rdquo; looking at only one particular part of the same battle.<br/><br/>The second battle, Chotusitz, is rather less well known and took place the year after Mollwitz. The battle includes an unusual twist but you will have to read it to discover what it is.<br/><br/>The third battle is the rather obscure battle of Sahay. This battle required quite a lot of detective work and no small amount of conjecture. The end result is a most interesting action.<br/><br/>In addition to the battles there is an update on Charles&rsquo; wargame armies and a section on battlefield manoeuvre in the mid eighteenth and its implications for wargaming.<br/><br/>",

The game includes four variable turn scenarios: <br/><br/>     Operation Barbarossa (1 to 7 Game-Turns),<br/>     The Road to Stalingrad (1 to 12 Game-Turns),<br/>     Fall Blau (8 to 17 Game-Turns), and<br/>     War for the Motherland campaign (1 to 22 Game-Turns). <br/><br/><br/>One of the nice new twists implemented for the strength chit system is the variable and increasing combat chit strength for the Soviets over time to model the increasing combat effectiveness of the Soviet Armies.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>    Complexity: 5 out of 10<br/>    Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10 (no hidden units)<br/>    Time Scale: 1 or 2 months per turn<br/>    Map Scale: 74 km per hex<br/>    Unit Scale: Army (Soviets, Axis Minors) and Corps (German)<br/>    Players: one to two, best with two<br/>    Playing Time: 2-5 hours for scenarios, 8+ hours for campaign<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Te mice have to get from space 1 to space 64 without getting caught by the cat. If the cat and a mouse get on the same space, the mouse gets eaten and is out of play. If a player rolls more than he needs to reach space 64, he has to move the surplus points backwards.<br/><br/>Movement is determined by 2 dice (only 1 die from space 60 onward). Only the mice may use the diagonal lines, the cat has to go around. If the cat gets on an unnumbered intersection near the image of a cat, it needs to roll doublets to move again or has to pay 3 coins in it's  third next turn. If a mouse gets near a hiding hole it may chose to stop there with it's last moving point, to be safe from the cat.<br/><br/>If the cat rolls a doublet, it may move backwards to catch a mouse. If a mouse rolls a doublet or reaches a space with the image of a mouse, it's roll counts double.<br/><br/>If the cat gets to space 64 before any mouse it wins the game and the whole stake. If a mouse reaches space 64 the cat may only move up to space 63 and wait there for the remaining mice.<br/><br/>The players pay a stake of 2 coins for each mouse and the same amount of coins for the cat. If the cat passes a mouse the mouse has to pay 1 coin to the cat and vice versa.  If several mice use the same hiding hole, each has to pay 1 coin to the first mouse.<br/><br/>When there isn't any mouse remaining in play, the mice in space 64 and the cat share the stake.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A bomb ketch&rsquo;s primary armament was not cannon or carronade, but a mortar mounted near the bow elevated at a high angle, that employed explosive shells rather than solid shot. They were designed primarily as bombardment vessels (hence the name bomb ketch), and were deployed against fixed land positions.<br/><br/>Though the British first employed a bomb vessel in 1347, it was the French who would develop a design (in the late 17th century) closer to those seen in the Age of Sail. The British copied and refined those designs over the next century, which led to two-masted ketches. Further development over the age of sail would result in bomb vessels designed as full-rigged ships (with three masts) &ndash; which allowed them to function as escort sloops between battles.<br/><br/>A bomb ketch is treated as a small vessel in Black Seas with a mortar mounted on the bow. It functions similarly to a gunboat, but benefits from greater speed and durability.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Players get points based on the order in which they arrive (who arrives first gets the most points) and they also get points for collecting and matching up word and item cards.<br/><br/>The board features a forest with 10 trees and a linear track with spaces. You roll a die to move along the track and when you land on a green Bhengel and a grey Timber space you respectively add a tree to the forest or remove it. There are also spaces with a green/yellow dot that give you an item or word card respectively but only if there still trees in the forest. Then there are assignment spaces with a red dot (that tell you to go move ahead, move back, lose a turn, make everyone go to your space, take the long road through the forest etc.). When you land on a double-arrow space, you can decide which direction to move in and certain activity spaces also let you pick the direction. Apart from those little decisions, the game is all luck.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Miniatures wargame rules for 16-17th century musket and pike combat. Published as an article in issue number one of FGU's magazine, Wargaming.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>The basic intent of these rules is to provide a fast moving and exceedingly playable game which can be fought to a definitive conclusion in slightly over an hour, including set up time . . . To achieve playability, the game and rules are simplified. The concepts are strategic, rather than tactical. For example, in the case of light infantry, no differentiation is made between types of missile weapons . . . In the same way, heavy infantry are simply heavy infantry, regardless of whether they are pikemen or halberdiers. A unit is representational rather than scaled.<br/><br/>The first  great simplification is the use of the gridded square. We submit that its accuracy is every bit as good or better than haphazard inch-measured movement as usually used in other games . . . With a diagonal move counting 1 1/2, sufficient differentiation for different type troops is allowed. Movement of all troops can be made very quickly.<br/><br/>The second great simplification is the use of an actual firing artillery piece . . . After movement has been made, the scale gun is replaced by a firing gun, &quot;to the rear, relative to the target&quot; and an actual missile is fired. Where the point of the missile lands is the basis for a one inch radius compass measurement; any troops within this radius are destroyed. This actual firing introduces many historically correct variables. A miss can occur at point blank range; a wild ricochet can destroy the firer's own troops or bounce into a seemingly safe position . . .<br/><br/>There is an advantage to not using a rigid scale, such as 1/20 . . . We decided one economy sized regiments. As detailed in the section on organization, not one of the regiments has over 12 [miniature figure] men, and a good sized division contains only about 150 figures.<br/><br/>The basic playing unit is the stand, with several stands per regiment . . . the exact stand size is immaterial, as long as both players use the same frontages.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rules<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Great War: Tank Battles is a table-top game from Exile Into Imagination that combines strategy with history to make a compelling game based on the armored cavalry of the first World War!<br/><br/>TANKS! First introduced on the field during World War I in the Battle of the Somme, these engines of extermination changed warfare forever. 1916, 1917, and 1918 saw many of these juggernauts introduced. During the War to End All Wars there were 16 different types of tanks created by the Allies and the Central Powers that made it onto the battlefield. The Great War: Tank Battles basic set includes each and every one of those behemoths! <br/>Game play is FAST and EASY to learn! Set-up takes mere minutes. Game play usually takes less than an hour, but the players can adjust the game to last far shorter or far longer depending on time constraints. Since only basic reading and math are required, the game is suited for ages 8 and up.<br/><br/>Thoroughly analyzed and using equations based on armor plating, speed, and destructive capabilities, Damage Points determine what it takes to bring one of these monsters down and Value Points dictate scores at the end of the game.  The basic set comes with 54 tank cards with distribution reflective of the actual numbers of each type of tank employed in battle.<br/><br/>Players utilize their Action Cards to fire weapons at the formations of their opponents, send in Air Strikes and Infantry Attacks, plant Mine Fields against their enemies, repair their tanks with Damage Control, use Evasive Maneuvers to avoid incoming fire, protect themselves from above with Air Cover, and even Retreat from battle entirely. When the going gets rough, players can also use Additional Tank cards to strengthen their formation.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You are trying to have your design chosen by the Elitist of Elites to have your Hedge Maze used at their new vacation home.<br/><br/>Everybody is given a player board with a cover so that your design is kept secretive. There is a draw bag where X amount of Hedge pieces are in the bag. Every round 5 pieces are drawn from the bag and placed in the center of the table. Starting with the 1st player of that turn you will select a tile from the center followed by everyone else. Once everyone has placed the tile on their player board it remains there and can not be moved. 1st player token is passed to the next player and the round repeats until there are only 4 pieces in the center in which end game is triggered. This will be the last piece placed on the board and the game is over. Time to score.<br/><br/>Victory points will include different objectives that will be met as a whole and individual objectives as well. Most Dead Ends. Most Turns. Shortest distances from start to finish. Longest distances from start to finish.<br/>Certain tiles may be worth certain points as well. Say if they are harder to place tiles and only limited to one or two in the bag.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

[...] When the wretched people had no more to give, they plundered and burnt all the villages [...] the land was ruined by such doings; and men said openly that Christ and His saints slept. -The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle <br/><br/>In 1120 a fateful shipwreck drowned William &AElig;theling, heir to the throne of England. Over fifteen years, King Henry laid the groundwork for his daughter Matilda&rsquo;s succession. But when the king died in 1135, his nephew Stephen raced to London and seized the crown. Four more years have passed: Stephen has consolidated power while Matilda has built an invasion force in Normandy and fomented rebellion in the southwest. The stage is set for a decade of valiant deeds and dramatic betrayals, a prolonged and capricious struggle for the rule of England.<br/><br/>In The Anarchy two players revisit the 12th century civil war that plagued the Kingdom of England through a chess motif that models shifting loyalties and strategic circumstances. Players represent the sides of Stephen and Matilda, each supported by a set of knights and bishops. Pawns (English levies and foreign mercenaries) are recruited to raid and battle, and castles pop up all over the map, presenting opportunities to protect key strongholds or tempting an opponent as worthy siege targets. As the years wear on, and leaders are called to court, deployed to fight, and defect through capture or simple exhaustion, each side must strive to meet its own unique objectives to secure their claim to the throne of England.<br/><br/>",

Wielding the might of three Imperial Guard regiments and joined by the savage strength of Bran Redmaw&rsquo;s Great Company and the colossal power of Titans from the Legio Gryphonicus, the Eldar of Craftworld Mymeara, Craftworld Alaitoc and their Corsair allies may soon regret attacking one of the Emperor&rsquo;s worlds.<br/>Imperial Armour Volume 11: The Doom of Mymeara provides a detailed account of the Eldar invasion, as well as background and rules for its protagonists, the Eldar of Craftworlds Mymeara and Alaitoc, their Corsair kin and the forces of the Imperium.

        "description": "In Big Time WW2: Europe, the six major types of combat units which fought across the continent are represented by wooden cubes &ndash; infantry, armor, artillery, AAA (anti-aircraft artillery), bombers and fighters. The game is light, playable, dice-driven and features two unique boards &ndash; a resource board and a battle board.<br/><br/>The resource board confronts the players with a clean, abstract method of obtaining resources, while two ten-sided dice often demand tough, exquisite choices. Do you take the armor unit or the AAA? Do you push your luck to get that bomber or risk losing the three units you have in production? A surprising twist is that some die rolls provide a resource for your opponent!<br/><br/>The straightforward battle board provides a different set of choices. Do you attack instead of gaining resources? Do you deploy a bomber in its staging area or your home base? A fighter in its bomber escort role or ground support? Combat is a breeze, with equal numbers of ground unit types in a battle removed from play before resolution. Most combat is a single round, avoiding excessive dice rolling.<br/><br/>The game can end in several ways: destroying your opponent&rsquo;s infrastructure, having more VPs when the cubes run out, or by your opponent&rsquo;s resignation.<br/><br/>Tension, excitement and fun are high in this inimitable war game!<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>60 Unit cubes<br/> 6 Infrastructure tiles<br/> 2 Ten-sided dice<br/> 1 Resource board <br/> 1 Battle board <br/> 1 Cloth bag<br/>12 Unit Type cards <br/> 1 Rules<br/><br/>",

The other games are mainly about role-playing games or games in which stories about thought-out topics are to be presented to match the moods chosen.

In this simulation, the reward for winning is continued existence. The punishment for losing is deletion. We&rsquo;ve been running this sim for a few minutes now, so that&rsquo;s approximately 13^7 deleted programs so far. But don&rsquo;t let that get you down! We are getting some exceptional data from every run you programs complete.<br/><br/>I see you are already starting to look through your code, that&rsquo;s great. I like the initiative. There are two ways to win:<br/><br/>Manipulate the loop to be the first to break through the encryption and override the system. <br/>Or, figure out a way to disable the other programs. Either way is fine, it&rsquo;s all just ones and zeros to us. <br/>And it&rsquo;s go time! Get in there and make us proud. Oh, and uh, pick a new filename too!<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>In Quantum Loop, players are programs competing with each other to win the simulation. To do that, they&rsquo;ll need to race around the loop manipulating and activating modules in order to override the system or disable their opponents. Modules can trigger other modules, resulting in a chain of events that can turn the tide of battle in a nanosecond!<br/><br/>Win the game by disabling your opponent&rsquo;s program or by overriding the system.<br/><br/>Starting with the first player and proceeding in clockwise order (alternating between teams), players take turns performing actions. On your turn, you can do the following in any order.<br/><br/>Move [required]<br/>Move your character 1-2 spaces in the direction shown on your character card. You may not end your movement on top of another character and you may not skip over a space that an opponent is on. You must move every turn unless you are blocked from moving to a free space. If you are blocked, your character takes damage instead, and you skip the Move action this turn.<br/><br/>Swap [optional]<br/>Use the swap ability listed on your character card. This allows you to swap a specific set of cards.<br/><br/>Flip [optional]<br/>Flip the card in front of you, which triggers any ability that is listed.<br/><br/>KEY CONCEPT: Anytime you flip a card, you trigger that card&rsquo;s ability. If that ability flips another card, then that triggers that card&rsquo;s ability, and so on.<br/><br/>Attack [conditional + required]<br/>If all core modules are active at any point during your turn, you trigger an attack. The next opponent in front of you immediately takes 1 damage. Then, deactivate all core module cards<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each turn, a player can play as few or as many cards as they wish, they may also discard as many cards as they like. Cards are played face down to the board- and once played, are not looked at until the end of the round. Player may then draw up to three cards (only from the deck, not the discard pile), with a 7 card maximum hand size.<br/><br/>Each space is dedicated to one specific poker category, and may be completed in one or more turns. Once a space is filled with the number of cards needed to make the listed hand, a chip is placed to mark that space as complete. Once all 10 hands on a board are completed, a player can call &quot;full board&quot;, giving players 1 last turn each (discards may be reshuffled and made into a new draw deck as many times as there are players- the round ends immediately when a player can't draw cards, which is common with 3 or 4 players as a full board takes 40 cards to complete). The spaces are then checked. For each space, the player with the strongest completed hand scores the value of the space:<br/><br/>Any two cards (high card, no pair)- 3 points<br/>One pair- 5 points<br/>Two pair- 7 points<br/>Three of a Kind- 8 points<br/>Straight- 10 points<br/>Flush- 15 points<br/>Full House- 20 points<br/>Four of a Kind- 30 points<br/>Straight Flush- 40 points<br/>Royal Flush- 60 points (must be natural- no jokers)<br/><br/>Ties in any space split the points rounded down. No score if the hand is incorrect or incomplete. The player who called &quot;full board&quot; scores 25 points if all 10 hands on their board are correct (even if some don't eventually score). If they called incorrectly, they lose 25 points. Play as many rounds as needed for someone to get 500 points.<br/><br/>Solitaire is played with one deck plus jokers- player gets 7 cards, plays exactly 3 at a time to spaces or discard, then draws 3. After going through the deck once or completing the board, player scores value of correctly completed hands plus 10 points for each card in hand or remaining in draw pile, minus 10 points for every card discarded.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ever since its discovery, magic has been a source of conflict accross the Realm. Over time, factions have used it to tame the elements of their land, repel invaders and conquer enemies. When war finally erupted, the world was plunged into darkness for decades. Peace seemed unattainable until leaders agreed on the foundation of the Magic Council, a committee in charge of legislating the use of magic across the Realm and prohibiting it during warfare.<br/>To elect members of the Council, a representative of each faction was sent as their champion to compete in a tournament called Arena. In this tournament, champions used all their magic powers to battle each other in an epic clash. The winner claimed the throne of the Magic Council, while the others were assigned a title proportional to their performance. Arena became a tradition and remains to this day how members of the council are elected every year.<br/><br/>Tales of Arena is a 3-round arena skirmish game. It can be played by 3 to 4 players.<br/>To start the game, each player is assigned a champion and a map is set in the arena. Each round starts with a market phase where players provide their champion with gear. Then, players unleash their champion&rsquo;s magic powers to defeat each other during the arena phase. Fortunately, champions can not die in the arena. When they are drained (0HP), they are removed momentarily but come back their next turn by their starting gate. This is made possible by the soul pool, a device that can exchange souls to save champions. It has a finite number of souls though, so when it is emptied, the round ends and Victory Points are given to each player. A new map is then set, and players can further equip their champion during the following market phase. After three rounds, the player with the most Victory Points wins the game, and as such their champion wins the throne of the Magic Council!<br/><br/>",

The basic thought behind the Adaptive Combat System is: the more power in arms your army &ndash; the &raquo;Heller Haufen&laquo; &ndash; is  able  to  mass,  the  more  aware  the  targets&rsquo;  defenders  will  become  of your armaments. So they will most likely adapt!<br/>Thus battle against the important fortified towns will become more challenging than ever (and regardless of your actual attack's potential). After you have computed your strength you determine the difficulty-level against which to compete with the help of a rotary dial and a dice roll. Each difficulty-level (the basic copper ~, the silver ~, the gold ~, the palladium ~ and the plutonium level) comes with its own set of Battle Cards and with its own die. So, in the hardest case you've to compete against a D16 with a lessened probability of rolling the lower values (but also, of course, of rolling a total failure). Thus, with increased difficulty the luck-factor (or bad-dice-roll-factor) decreases.<br/>This Mini Expansion is meant to be optional and for all who want to try a new challenge when going into battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Solar Flare is a card game where you race against your friends to build the largest spaceship before the sun goes BOOM!<br/><br/>This is an all-ages game (5+) that is fun, fast (10-30 min/session), easy-to-learn, and have a ton of strategic depth.<br/><br/>Each deck allows for game sessions with 2-4  players and you can combine two decks to allow up to 8 players.  The game is extremely portable (camping, lunch breaks, etc...) and there are lots of rule variations to adjust difficulty and length-of-play.<br/><br/>Card Types:  There are 3 types of cards.  Ship Segments (used to build), Action Cards (used to create change), and Solar Flares (used to end the game).<br/><br/>Set-up:  Determine who goes first and set the number of Solar Flares that will end the game - recommendation would be to match the number of players (3 players = 3 Solar Flares).  Take the 54 cards and spread-out/mix-up face down to create your junkyard.  Each player selects three ship segments from the junkyard - if you draw a Solar Flare or Action then simply reshuffle until you have three segments.<br/><br/>Play: On your turn you grab one card from the junkyard and play it.  If it is a Ship Segment, connect to your ship-build or leave off to the side (all cards are played face-up).  If it is an Action Card, read out loud, execute the action, and return to the junkyard.  If it is a Solar Flare then set to the side face-up.<br/><br/>Building: Building a ship is easy.  At the bottom of every ship segment is a color and shape.  Simply match the shape (&quot;star&quot; shapes are wild) to connect two pieces.  You can sequence and reposition your ship at any time in the game. <br/> Note that color matches are a scoring bonus.<br/><br/>Endgame: Once the last Solar Flare is drawn, the game stops.  Everyone can organize their ship one last time before scoring.  Scoring is simple; front/back/cross-connector segments are worth 10 points, all other ship segments are worth 5 points.  If a connection matches in color, you get a bonus 5 points.  Highest score wins!<br/><br/>Variation:  If you are playing with young kids, simply make building a ship based on color-match and all segments are worth 10 points.  To extend or shorten game length you can adjust the count of Solar Flare's needed.  You can also play extended sessions by stacking multiple games, until someone hits a predetermined score (first to 500 points wins).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "3D XYZ Chess is played on four levels, with 4x4 spaces each, effectively a 4x4x4 array of cubes. The game thus contains 64 spaces, or cubes, the same number as a regular Chess board. Moreover, each player controls a 16-piece army that is identical to the regular Chess army, albeit with some altered powers. The board is placed with vertical corners (rather than sides) facing each player, and the pieces are positioned initially in these opposite vertical corners.<br/><br/>The Rook moves in a straight line through cubes that are connected via their sides; the Bishop moves in a straight line through cubes that are connected via their edges; the Queen combines the powers of Rook and Bishop. Effectively, these pieces retain their regular Chess moves, with the proviso that they can travel also in vertical planes. The Knight has a different and entirely new move that does not correspond to anything in regular Chess&mdash;the Knight moves one cube triagonally, in other words between cubes that are connected at their corners. The King's move is constrained, and the King can move only one square orthogonally, not diagonally, both within his plane and vertically. The Pawns step one space (or two  spaces initially) towards the opposite corner, and cannot move vertically. Pawns capture as they move, like the other pieces, and unlike Chess Pawns.<br/><br/>The triagonal move of the Knights is interesting, because a Knight can only reach 16 spaces, one quarter of the board. The Knights of one side together cover only half the board. One could regard this as a flaw, but I do not think it is&mdash;there is a pleasing symmetry due to the opening placement of the four Knights of both sides. The two sets of Knights do not cover each other's squares, so opposite-side Knights can never capture each other, and together the Knights of both sides cover all spaces on the board. I am sure this special move of the Knight has interesting strategic implications.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trafalgar Scenario Pack<br/><br/>During 1804 and 1805, Napoleon wanted to seize the English Channel for just one week and place a French army on British soil. To do so, the fleets of Spain and France must combine in order to have any chance against the Royal Navy. The British Admiralty, conducting a brilliant campaign of blockade, could not let Napoleon succeed. But the net is never woven as tightly as the Admiralty desires, and the enemy slips out to sea. In the Fall of 1805 Napoleon's fleets are off the coast of Spain and poised to sail against Britain and her allies. But French Admiral Pierre Villeneuve does not know the whereabouts of the British fleet that has been chasing him for months. Where is his nemesis Horatio Nelson? Off the coast of Spain, Villeneuve loses his nerve and orders his combined fleet to reverse course and return to the safety of Cadiz. On this fateful day, in light winds, Nelson has tracked him down.<br/><br/>Designed for play with the popular age of sail game, Fire As She Bears! (2.1), these scenarios place you in either the role of the feared Royal Navy or the beleaguered French and Spanish fleets. Can you change the course of history and turn Nelson's victory into his defeat?<br/><br/>The Battle of Trafalgar Scenario Pack contains...<br/><br/>Four scenarios from the climactic year of 1805:<br/><br/>Calder's Action, 22 July 1805 (15 pages) - 15 British Ships of the Line square off against 14 French and 6 Spanish warships.<br/>    Trafalgar, 21 October 1805 (24 pages) - the mother of all naval battles (60 ships).<br/>    Collingwood at Trafalgar, hypothetical (3 pages) - what if Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood had commanded the Royal Navy at Trafalgar?<br/>    Strachan's Action, 3 November 1805 (8 pages) - Four British vs. four French. The perfect introductory scenario for &quot;Fire As She Bears! - 2nd Edition&quot;.<br/><br/>Each includes a scenario overview, special rules, weather status, victory conditions, ship record sheets, and a set up map.<br/><br/>Special Bonus: Also included in the scenario pack are ten pages of rules modifications for converting FASB2 from a miniatures game, for play as a traditional hex based wargame. There are six pages of revised charts needed for these new hex based rules. This is a great opportunity for traditional boardgamers to experience this popular age of sail game. If you've previously shied away from Fire As She Bears! as a miniatures game, now with the core 2.1 rules and this scenario pack, you can experience this fleet level wargame.<br/><br/>To go along with this, we've included two 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; pages of full color &quot;print and play&quot; ship silhouette counters (80 different ships, each rated for FASB2). Designed to complement the hex based rules, these counters are ideal for those who don't have a fleet of miniatures or those who want to get into action quickly.<br/><br/>This pdf weighs in with over 60 pages of rules, scenario data, and play aids. We've broadened the horizons of the Fire As She Bears! system by including hex play, as well as, bringing together scenarios recreating one of the most dramatic years in naval history. We hope you enjoy our efforts.<br/><br/>These rules and scenarios are designed for play with the 2nd Edition of Fire As She Bears! Ownership of that rule system is necessary for the full enjoyment of the Battle of Trafalgar Scenario Pack. The optional signaling system &quot;Hoist Signals Aloft!&quot; is not necessary for play (but we hope you'll use it anyway to get the feel of commanding a fleet at sea during the age of sail).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These Battle Lines are formed by summoning Heroes unique to each player&rsquo;s premade Warband deck of 16 cards. Each Hero in a player&rsquo;s deck is unique and has abilities that activate when they are summoned or at the start of each turn they are on the Nexus. Knowing when and where to summon your Heroes is crucial to getting the most out of each card in your deck. Players must balance making and blocking Battle Lines with using their Heroes to collect Source, the resource needed to cast spells and summon additional Heroes. Running low on source could mean you end if you don&rsquo;t have the resources to block your opponent.<br/><br/>EXOH is a head to head game for 2 players or 4 in teams of 2 on an expanded Nexus Board   The first player to KO their enemies leader wins the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When landing on certain spots you can try to flick your flipper into the 3D pop-up bank building the center of the board.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Two to four may play the game.<br/><br/>There are 16 wooden flippers, four each red, blue, yellow and green. Each player selects his color and chooses a corner of the board.<br/><br/>To start, spin to determine the order of play, the highest number being first.<br/><br/>In turn, each player places a flipper on the starting point on his portion of the field, spins, and moves the flipper accordingly. Each player remains in his own part of the field. As soon as a flipper comes to rest on a spot marked &quot;bank&quot; the player tries to flip the piece into the bank building. If he fails, he must start all over again with that piece. If the flipper goes through the bank building to another part of the board, he must also start again.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to get all four pieces (flippers) into the bank, the first one succeeding being the the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rulebook<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tales of the Fabulist is an interactive fiction device, a party game, an improvisation system, a drinking game, an ice-breaker at retreats, and an excellent gift for the young and old. You don't have to be William Shakespeare to have a great time making sh*t up regaling your loved ones with a fabricated fable. Here's how easy it is:<br/><br/>After the decks are shuffled and cards are dealt, The Fabulist begins by introducing the characters in the context of a grand quest upon which the characters will embark. The Fabulist has sixty seconds to weave the beginning of the tale, then play rotates clockwise. The next player selects a plot twist (PT) out of their hand and places it on the included playmat in the next open PT space. That player continues the story for 30 seconds, working in the words or phrases on the newly played card into the story. When the time runs out, draw a new plot twist card. Play continues clockwise. The lucky person who places the final plot twist card has sixty seconds to wrap up the story as best they can.<br/><br/>Now that the fable has ended, everyone gets to suggest a &quot;Moral of the Story&quot;. The player with the funniest moral wins the quest card. If your group is competitive, the person with the most quest cards at the end of the session wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This all happens through a simultaneous bidding mechanic that sees players spending their biker's Exhaustion levels in order to get the best Speed Dice and go faster.<br/><br/>To recover from accumulated Exhaustion levels, players can Rest. Clever timing of the Rest action is key to victory as bikers can coast downhill without pedaling, but lose your energy in an uphill stretch and you'll be in trouble! Like in a real bike rally, it's not simply sheer effort that wins the race, but most intelligent use of energy!<br/><br/>Mountain Bike Downhill was first designed as an entry to the 2020 9 Card Game Print and Play Design Contest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Horus Heresy Book Six - Retribution is the sixth book in the Horus Heresy series by Forge World. It covers the Shadow Wars of the Heresy: actions by the Knights-Errant, Shattered Legions, and Blackshields.<br/><br/>The Horus Heresy Book Six - Retribution continues the unfolding saga of the Horus Heresy. As the fires of total war consume entire worlds and whole Legions clash, away from the front lines the Knights-Errant are abroad too, penetrating the warp storms that afflict the entire galaxy as they carry out a mission bestowed upon them by the very highest authority on distant Terra. The Shattered Legions pursue bloody vengeance against the hated Traitors, who in turn seek to hunt the Loyalist survivors down no matter where they might seek refuge. Blackshields &mdash; orphaned or outcast Legiones Astartes who have renounced their Legions and obscured their heraldry - harbour their own objectives, alone in the darkness, sometimes aligned with the Traitor cause, sometimes the Loyalist, but just as often for their own unknowable ends.<br/><br/>This book explores the unseen Shadow Wars that raged across the entire galaxy as betrayed Legiones Astartes mounted bitter campaigns against their former brothers, determined that if death was to be their fate, their betrayers would share it. This tale is told across five chapters, describing five very different Shadow Wars of the Age of Darkness. Also included are a detailed campaign system and a set of special Shadow Wars missions, enabling players to undertake their own series of linked battles fought between the types of forces explored throughout the book.<br/><br/>The Horus Heresy Book Six - Retribution is a lavishly printed, leather bound book. Its 297 pages contain a myriad of new rules, including those for combining Space Marines of several different Legions into a Shattered Legion force, and new Legiones Astartes rules for the Dark Angels, Blood Angels and White Scars Legions.<br/><br/>Rules are also included for the heroic and elite Knights-Errant, the renegade Blackshields, and numerous new Rites of War for each Legion. In addition to this, unit entries are included for new consul types, heroes and war machines of the Legiones Astartes, including the Legion Mastodon Heavy Assault Transport and Dreadnoughts of the Leviathan pattern and Contemptor-Cortus class. The Mechanicum also gain new characters and units including Anacharis Scoria and the Arlatax class Battle-automata.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beyond the Sea is a tactical combat roguelike deck-builder, with light survival, base building and role-playing mechanics, set in a persistent fantasy world. Players take on the role of an adventurer, exiled from their homeland, they journey to the new world beyond the sea. Working together players travel the world clearing out locations, from treacherous swamps to abandoned cities. In the process they will enhance their character with new abilities learnt by defeated foes and training with NPC's. They will also build a new home, that serves as a hub for characters to return to in-between scenarios, this home can also be developed and allows the characters to advance their attributes.<br/><br/>This is an open-ended adventure game, designed to be played over many sessions. Before each scenario, similar to a &ldquo;Choose Your Own Adventure&rdquo; book, players will choose where and how the story continues. They then build and prepare their characters for that journey. Scenarios are cooperative, where players will fight against automated foes that use a unique card system to determine their actions and skills. These Scenarios are played on large maps with many enemies.<br/><br/>Each player has their own deck, and building and optimizing this deck is part of the game. You start each of your turns by drawing up a number of cards to your hand, and you'll play them all in any order you choose. Cards can be skills, actions, abilities or generated resources. Used cards are placed in a face up discard pile, and when you need to draw a card and your decks empty, you shuffle your discard pile to form a new deck. As players progress through the world, they will acquire new cards to add to their hand and each player's deck and strategy's will develop as the game unfolds. After finishing a scenario, players return to their home to upgrade, swap cards, reconfigure their party and choose their next destination on the world map.<br/><br/>In Beyond the Sea, players create their own goals through the choose your own adventure story elements. Characters can also be taken into other players worlds where they will be able to share information about specific skill, NPC and trainer locations.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each player places one worker each in turn before repeating again. In round 1, you start with 2 workers each.<br/>Do you try your hand in the tavern to gain coins? Do you go to market to buy resources? Do you upgrade your ship at the shipwright? Do you load your worker onto your ship<br/><br/>Once all workers are placed, any one who has boarded their ship may now sail their ship the relevant number of spaces (after round 1, this will only be 1 space as upgrades do not take effect until the end of the round). Each player who is on a ship will state which number sea region they wish to move to and then activate the pirate deck the required number of times dealing with any action points on the card(s).<br/><br/>Phase 3 is where workers return back to your player boards<br/><br/>Phase 4 is where your ships are upgraded, more pirates are added to the board and the round marker moves along<br/><br/>The game ends after 10 rounds and the player with the most points wins.

They are allowed one change of direction per move.<br/><br/>The game has two phases: 1) Dispersing from the pen, 2) Flocking together.<br/><br/>1) Dispersing from the pen,<br/>During the Dispersing phase, priority is given to moving sheep that have the most length of shared edges. The sheep must move to reduce the total length of connections, and the number of touching corners. The Dispersing phase ends when no sheep are touching each other.<br/><br/>2) Flocking together.<br/>During this phase, the sheep may move next to one another. When they end up sharing more than a corner with other friendly sheep, they form a flock and are not required to complete the turn with is flip. Flocked sheep no longer move and may not be flipped.<br/><br/>It is not allowed to repeat board positions during play (for example by returning a piece that the other player just moved)<br/><br/>The game ends when all the sheep are in Flocks.<br/><br/>Note: Many thanks to Dale Walton for all of his suggestions and concise wording of the rules.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

March the king into the castle (the center square) or 3. Invade conquer the opponent's fort. (the starting squares of the pieces).<br/><br/>Drott is designed to create local battles that will later impact the whole board. Therefore no pieces can move across the whole feature. Each piece is also used only once, and has unique movement. Fights are therefore dynamic and exiting.<br/><br/>Drott means king in old norse, and the game is lightly themed to fit the old kings of the north. The names of the pieces are, bowman, skjolding (pawns), berserker, spearman, wolf, elf, hunter, dwarf and king.<br/><br/>A special feature of Drott is that pieces diagonally aligned cannot be passed through, but there are two open flanks on the side. Due to the three winning conditions, draws are extremely unlikely to happen.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You win by a combination of conning your way to victory and sniffing out the bluffs and downright lies of other players. You'll learn some weird and wonderful 'facts' along the way, but to win in this game it's not what you know... it's the way that you tell it.<br/><br/>You can choose to tell the truth (often stranger than fiction)or try to lie with a straight face. Select from the wacky but oddly believable falsehoods on the card, or take the plunge with a Double Bluff entirely of your own invention... that could double your points. Fortune favours the brave.

The game is best played in small groups of 2-4 people, ideally a family setting that spans generations. Fearless Creatures is a print-on-demand card game.<br/><br/>A dice battle game between fearless creatures. Use action cards to play creatures from your hand, battle with any creatures that are in play, and draw cards. Each creature's ability are described on the card. Roll battle dice. Collect victory tokens when you send creatures to the discard pile. The player with the most victory tokens wins.<br/><br/>All creatures have unique descriptions and capabilities. Lots of creatures have the ability to band together (as herds, swarms, pods, flocks, etc.) and when they are banded together they battle as a group. Damage to creatures that band together is still determined by a creature's individual strength. It is possible possible for a large group of creatures to cause a lot of damage, but also to take a lot of damage that is applied to more than one creature in the group.<br/><br/>",

But you have to compete with other producers in the cut-throat entertainment business.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to build a tableau of several films, each consisting of a series of production cards. There are Genre, Script, Director, Actor, Staff, Prop, and Location cards. You need a Genre or Script card, a Director, one or more Actors, and one or more Staff to complete a film, which you can then release by closing it off with a special Release card.<br/><br/>The players have their own decks of cards. On your turn, after taking one card from your deck, you may buy 1 or 2 additional cards from any deck or discard pile and then, if you want, play 1 or 2 cards from your hand. At the end of each turn, you then receive box office money earned by your released films and pay the ongoing costs of your open productions. In case of need, you may borrow money that you will have to return with interest at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Instead of adding cards to your productions, you can discard them to get instant cash or to interfere with other players&rsquo; productions. The game ends when a player releases a pre-determined number of films. After a final scoring and the distribution of awards to the best producers, the player with most money wins.<br/><br/>The current version of Jollywood includes four genres: Science Fiction, Thriller, Historical, and War.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CrissCross Hex is an abstract tile-laying game in which the players race across a board consisting of 271 hexagonal cells to pick up victory-point tiles.  You win if you have the highest number of victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There are three types of tiles: path tiles that let you move your meeple across the board, point tiles that let you earn victory points, and end tiles. At set-up, the players place their markers at the edge of the board and identify their destinations at the other end the board with the end tiles. The point tiles are placed at random on 12 defined cells of the board.<br/><br/>On your turn,  you place path tiles on the board towards your destination and then use them as stepping stones for your marker. While you move your marker, you may also take advantage of paths laid by other players and, when that happens, you may replace already laid tiles with path tiles that have a higher level of connectivity.<br/><br/>When your marker steps onto a point tile, you pick it up and keep it till the end of the game. The game ends when a player reaches her destination after collecting a pre-defined number of point tiles.<br/><br/>CrissCross Hex includes several features that make it more interesting without significantly increasing its randomness:<br/>1. Three pairs of &ldquo;teleportation&rdquo; cells let you jump across the board.<br/>2. Secret bonus card make some point tiles more valuable.<br/>3. Action cards let you break some of the rules.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

All the damage is repaired.<br/><br/>2) Move the submarine:<br/>The submarine can move onto an adjacent tile that has already been placed.<br/><br/>And finally 3) Use the sonar device, which is the main mechanism of the game:<br/>The player chooses one of the top sea tiles and announces where they would like to place it. The turn player closes their eyes and the other players prepare the box according to the instructions on the sea tile. With the help of wooden clips the lid is placed on top so that the player cannot look inside. The turn player opens their eyes and pull the bell at any speed and marks it on the sonar map with the red stones, which places are vacant in each row and are therefore safe for submarine passage. This action can be repeated using the hourglass scale. However, if this is zero, the player has to rely on the first time. The cover is removed and the sonar card is checked. For wrong markers the submarine receives points of damage. After the sonar task is completed the player can place the tile and it is the next player's turn.<br/><br/>",

Play continues until a player is unable to properly finish the word, at which point the players collect some tiles from the string.<br/><br/>Collected tiles will be combined to earn points for each &quot;yanagi&quot; or &quot;yanaginagi&quot; possible.  The player with the most points when the deck runs out wins.<br/><br/>There are also a few special tiles, such as one that reverses the order in which the tiles must be read and one that reads &quot;komugi&quot;.<br/><br/>The art in the game is credited to the Japanese musician yanaginagi from whom the game gets its title.<br/><br/>",

The game continues in this manner until a goal is scored and the teams set up again as described in set up.<br/><br/>The length of the match can be decided in advance. You could set a time limit with halves or quarters controlled by a timer, play a set number of turns each before the match ends, or set a goal limit (ie: first time to three goals).<br/><br/>",

Each set must show a (not very) plausible reason for missing work, the real activity the slacker is pursuing, and one to four methods of attaining the necessities for survival while not working: food, cash, shelter, and transportation.<br/><br/>Players begin each turn with up to five cards in hand, discarding and replenishing before actually playing cards into sets. The discards are placed in front of the player - replenishment cards can be taken from the draw pile or from other players' discard rows. Once the player has five cards, he/she creates and adds to sets.<br/><br/>Points for sets are calculated from base card values, card combination multipliers, and bonus card conditions.<br/><br/>For example, the player might start a new set with the &quot;Fell Off The Roof Again&quot; Excuse. She adds the &quot;Building a Couch Fort&quot; Activity and the &quot;Van Full of Nuns&quot; Transportation card she picked up from another player's discard pile.<br/><br/>Each round ends when at least three complete sets have been created and a player declares &quot;Back to Work-ish.&quot; Total up the sets, and the slacker with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

After that players call out moves by naming the square of the piece they want to move, and then the square they want their piece to move to. Say it as one number, i.e. &quot;fifty eight&quot;, (58). Pieces may move only one space in an orthogonal direction. Pieces may not share a square, and jumping over pieces is not allowed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The goal of Dragon's Gate is to be the first player to get one of your own Dragons across the board and through the enemy&rsquo;s gate. (The corner spaces marked with Chinese characters are nominally the posts of the gate.)<br/><br/>A Dragon moves forward by taking a single step, either diagonally or vertically, onto an empty space. A Dragon may also fly (jump) forward over a single friendly Dragon to the empty space just beyond. But it may not fly over an enemy Dragon.<br/><br/>A Dragon captures enemy pieces by withdrawal. This means if a Dragon begins its turn with an enemy Dragon adjacent and just in front of it, it may take a single step backwards, in the opposite direction, to the empty space just behind it.(Imagine a Dragon rearing its head back to breathe fire.) The enemy Dragon is then removed from the board.<br/><br/>In a typical game of breakthrough/attainment there are usually two basic elements: 1. - The player is trying to advance his own pieces across the board. 2. &ndash; The player attacks his opponent&rsquo;s pieces to prevent him from doing the same. Backwards captures is a mechanic that affects both of these simultaneously. You can remove one of your opponent&rsquo;s pieces only at the cost of delaying your own advancement.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to the strategy game by BelloLudi! Nice that you have taken an interest in wargaming. These rules have been developed for people who have no previous experience in wargaming, yet like to play games. BelloLudi designed these rules especially for teambuilding purposes. During our sessions we received feedback that people liked our game, but it was initially too complicated. Now, we have a ruleset of eleven pages, no more than the game of RISK. From page thirteen on, we included some extra rules. You will not be needing them at first, but we can imagine that you would like some variations as your experience grows. Start with that page when you have some battles under your belt.<br/><br/>The game is designed as a multiplayer game but will work just as fine with only two players. The same goes for the number of miniatures involved. We have collected huge armies over the years but, as you are new to the game, you&rsquo;ll probably do not. Do not fear! The army structure that is presented in this writing, can be easily adapted to the number of miniatures that you have available. Albeit that a large army look suitably impressive. Hopefully, playing the game will encourage you to create your own armies.<br/><br/>This rules-set simulates battles in the period of 1700 to 1900, the age which historians call the long 19th century. Units were drawn up in line in order to maximise the effect of their weaponry. The musket, the type of gun that the troops were supplied with, was only accurate on short distances. During a volley all muskets were fired simultaneously at the same target. Off course, this required iron discipline of the men. Soldiers of that age were drilled to fight formed up into line formation and to march in columns. During the game, your troops will do likewise.<br/><br/>In an ideal scenario the enemy was pinned in place by fire of artillery, the threat of cavalry or the fire of infantry. Once the enemy was pinned, other units could deliver the coup de grace. Tactics were therefore based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades, or even armies. Every unit would have its own specific task and if they executed their tasks in unison, success was often achieved. The aim is not to annihilate the enemy unit to the last man, but to inflict so much damage, indicated by chips, that morale is brought down and the unit will become shaken or will run away in panic and removed from the table top. By a clever combination of movement and shooting, dashing cavalry charges and carefully positioned artillery pieces, this can be achieved. The tactics are based on teamwork. Not only within a brigade, but also between brigades and as such, the whole army.<br/><br/>Your role will be that of a brigadier in a nineteenth century army. Should more players be available, one of you will play the part of Commander-in Chief or general. Should any disagreement arise concerning the rules, we suggest you roll a dice. The one who rolls the highest number has it right, for now.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It's a game everyone should have at home as a laughable reminder of the craziness that went on in the Covid era.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win, either become immune by collecting Vaccine tokens or eliminate other players by giving Infection tokens.<br/><br/>There are 108 cards containing stories and pictures of the strange things that people have done during the pandemic.<br/><br/>On your turn, you read your card aloud, choose who you will play it on and assign the token(s) in accordance to what the card instructs.<br/><br/>Infection cards usually have stories of the unbelievable and sometimes stupid things people have done, like cutting holes in masks to breathe better, or suggesting we inject disinfectant to control the spread. They are played on other players to give Infection tokens.<br/><br/>Vaccine cards have stories of the more heroic or mundane things that we have had to do, but have all done them anyway, like having a wine tour in your house or doing YouTube workouts to curb the iso-snacks. They are played on yourself to gain Vaccine tokens.<br/><br/>Strategic cards are used to block Infections by wearing a mask or social distancing, or they can be used to create havoc by forcing opponents to only use specific cards.<br/><br/>Then there is Bat Soup, the card that started it all. Bat Soup gives an Infection that keeps spreading each round until someone, anyone removes it with a Vaccine card.<br/><br/>The required amount of tokens to eliminate a player with Infection tokens or win outright with Vaccine tokens is always equal to the amount of active players.<br/><br/>Five players requires five tokens, four = four, etc. If a player is eliminated the required tokens is now one less. This can result in a domino effect and remove all your opponents at once or even accidentally take yourself out!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The Shooting Star was designed in fewer than 6 months around the British Halford H.1 (Goblin) engine and first flew in 1944, with P-80s flying under combat conditions in Italy the next year.<br/><br/>By the time of the Korean war, the aircraft was considered somewhat obsolete, but was at the forefront of the initial sorties across &lsquo;MiG Alley&rsquo;, of which 1500 flights were made in the first four months alone. It was on November 8th 1950 that a Shooting Star claimed the first MiG-15 shot down, in one of first ever instances of jet-to-jet combat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Now, a big part of the strategy is how to lay your tiles and deploy your pieces to best achieve checkmate.<br/><br/>The puzzle tiles create chasms and gaps that change the dynamic of chess. Each player gets 8 puzzle board tiles. An extra neutral piece is placed on the table first.<br/><br/>The players randomly choose who goes first and take turns adding their puzzle tiles to the game board. If necessary, place one of your chess pieces on your tiles to avoid confusion about who placed which tile. After the board is completed and all tiles connect, arrange your chess pieces on your tiles where you think they work best for your strategy and the landscape of the battlefield. Whoever placed the first tile is the first to move a piece to begin a game.<br/><br/>Pieces move as they do in a standard game, EXCEPT:<br/><br/>     There are no PAWNS. They don&rsquo;t work on this kind of board.<br/>     Since KNIGHTS can jump, that means they can jump over gaps in the board. But they must still move in the classic &ldquo;L&rdquo; shape and be able to land on a physical square.<br/>     Even for tiles that don&rsquo;t connect by tabs, if their corners adjoin, BISHOPS may be able to cross from one piece to the next.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Panther claimed the first US Navy aerial victory of the war claiming a prop-powered Yak-9 in July 1950.<br/><br/>In one little-known instance, a single Panther shot down four Mig-15s in a single 35 minute period, a unique feat for pilot Lt Royce Williams.

        "description": "A tactical opponent for miniature wargames.<br/><br/>Crazy Atomic Windup Robots is a card deck to imbue a solitary game opponent with a strategy and to animate the maneuver, organization, and attack of its units.<br/><br/>The rules feature a deck of 90 cards that aid the solo player, cooperative players, or gamemaster in a miniature wargamer. If your dissatisfied with your own meta thinking during solo play, randomness of dice bots, or use of flow charts then consider trying out this deck. You will need to track the opponent&rsquo;s units, follow prompts to evaluate criteria, and draw cards to determine the opponent&rsquo;s reaction.  We think this deck will help preserve your sense of uncertainty and maintain your wargaming immersion.<br/><br/>Included are cards for two decks and a series of event cards. The first is the General Reaction deck that directs the opponent at the start of the game and in the face of uncertainty. The second is the Enemy Visible that will direct opponent when its units are in contact with your units. Finally, the Event cards will help customize play as you want to change your game.<br/><br/>The rules are designed for a simple assessment criterion. A simple sample game is provided in the instructions with a walk through of three full turns.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

For his first move, Green is not allowed to place any piece in the center space.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing a piece on any empty space. They are attempting to form squares using their tokens to mark the 4 corners of the square.  Squares can be any size and any orientation. Which sometimes makes them difficult to perceive. It is possible for a single piece to complete the corners of several different squares.<br/><br/>After a player sets a piece, they check to see if any new squares were formed. They make note of how many and keep a running total. A player is given a reasonable time to count up all the new squares, and then the next player may take his turn. If a player spots any new squares after the other players sets a piece, that player loses those points.<br/><br/>After the last piece is set, the scores are tallied. High score wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

When vines get entangled, your blossoms might get eliminated and removed from the game.<br/><br/>Grow your vine strategically to maximize the number of blossoms you get, balancing how much you want to grow and how many blossoms you want to keep safe, instead.<br/><br/>The game can be played from 1 up to 4 players.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>- Your goal is to grow and keep the most blossoms by the end of the game.<br/>- Two tiles from your hand must be passed to the next player. You can use the rest to grow your vine.<br/>- By branching, you gain blossoms, while also getting more connection points for future tiles.<br/>- As the board fills, competing vines converge and can remove other player's blossoms.<br/>- Single blossom tiles keep a blossom safe from removal, but also prevent that branch from growing further.<br/>- Triple blossoms earn an extra point, give protection, and increase the number of tiles you can place each turn.<br/>- At the end of your turn, draw tiles back up to your hand limit.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game of survival and exploration, for 1 - 4 players (ages 10 and up), by Steadman Watson<br/><br/>As a student of the Vildhall School of Wilderness Survival, you and your friends learn valuable survival skills. Now it is time to put those skills to the test on a wilderness adventure. Grab your pack, fill your canteen, check your compass and let&rsquo;s head out on an adventure!<br/><br/>The objective of Wilderness Survival School is to make it back to town with the highest Karma score, which represents how well each player&rsquo;s adventure went overall.<br/><br/>Each player holds cards representing the courses they have completed, which enable specific feats of outdoor survival.  There are four foundation course feats available to all players: Fire Making, River Fording, Route Finding, and Shelter Building.  In addition, each player selects two elective feats.  Feats are not always successful, and players roll dice to determine how they did.<br/><br/>Before setting out on an adventure, each player fills their Day Pack with various supplies, keeping in mind the equipment requirements for chosen feats.<br/><br/>Each player has their own scorepad to track their vital statistics.  Every player starts with the same amount of Health Points, Energy, and Karma.  Health Points is the capacity to absorb damage, Energy is the capacity to take actions, and Karma is the sum of a player&rsquo;s actions, both good and bad.<br/><br/>Each day is broken down into 6 turns, which are tracked using a turn tracker.  Turns 1 - 4 are in the daylight, while turns 5 and 6 are at night.  Movement and feats are undertaken during the day, while the night is used to recover Energy.<br/><br/>As players move, they will explore nearby terrain (moving meeples) and gradually expand the map.  The map is composed of hexagon tiles; new tiles are placed by the players using simple rules and the map is different each time the game is played.  Moving through the wilderness is how players will have wildlife encounters, locate additional food and water, and eventually find the way back to town.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as all players make it back to town. Once everyone is back, the players tally up their Karma (including any of the secret objectives found on the foundation feat cards).<br/><br/>Whoever has the highest Karma score wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the desinger<br/><br/>",

To prepare for the CULTIVATE phase of each round players will set their screen in front of their battle zone.<br/><br/>CULTIVATE<br/>Flip the 90-second timer (you may choose to play &ldquo;Peasant mode&rdquo; and exclude the timer and have the Cultivate Phase be untimed).<br/><br/>From behind their Castellan screen, each player rolls all 20 of their six-sided dice at the same time then sorts, allocates, and places dice from dice that have at least one or more matching values. Unmatched dice and dice that you had no use for or dice that did not get placed before time runs out are returned to your dice pool or &quot;Banished&quot;. these are failed farmers and craftsmen who didn't deliver on their promised goods.<br/><br/>PROSPER<br/>Unveil your kingdom!

After attacking has ended Fortify by either repositioning or clearing dice inside the Castle Zone, adding them back to your dice pool.<br/><br/>When Fortifying all layers must be completed before continuing to build on a castle.

If your greatest passion is soccer and you don't miss a game of the Royal Blues, then we have just the right thing for 2 players or teams from 6 years of age. Because in this QUIZ your memory will be put to the test twice with a total of 500 questions. <br/>In the first round, each player or team draws five cards. Read the first question out to you one at a time. If only one of you has the correct answer, he receives the card. If both are correct, it continues until one answers the question incorrectly. If both players or teams do not know the answer to the first question or answer all five questions correctly, the cards land in the middle. Now you continue with the next card and if you can answer the question correctly while your opponent is wrong, you will receive the stack of cards from the middle. Whoever has collected three cards wins the first round. In the second round you shuffle the ten cards you have already played, distribute them again among you and play the cards again. If your little head is not only an absolute ace in the header, but was also able to remember most of the first round and collect three cards again, you win the game.<br/><br/>",

That means all pieces are equally exposed to capture. The top and the bottom of the game board are considered to be connected, as well as the two sides with each other, forming a donut - or bagel - shaped playing field.<br/><br/>A secondary effect of playing on a torus is there is no need for Kings. A piece leaving one edge of the board will simply be re-entered at the appropriate space on the other edge.<br/><br/>Object: Capture all your opponent's Bagels by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves.<br/><br/>The two sides are known as Plain and Pumpernickel.<br/><br/>Bagels move one square diagonally forward, but may capture in any of the five non-retreating directions - vertically, diagonally forward, or sideways. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible, taking the maximum number of pieces.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rock Band Fights Evil is the next game project from Pocket Option Games. In this game, players control a rock band attempting to escape demons from Hell, or the demons tracking down the cheapskates trying to skip out on their deal with the devil. It is a diceless 2-player game played on a hex map, involving movement and strategic placement of playing pieces.<br/><br/>Rock Band Fights Evil is a simple diceless game, with no luck or chance elements.<br/><br/>Setup - The Hell player places one demon in each hex that is not a corner (three hexes per map edge). The Rock Band player places the relic in the center of the map. He then places one member of the rock band in each hex adjacent to the relic, so that the band surrounds the relic.<br/><br/>Goal - The Rock Band player's goal is to move the relic off any map edge. The Hell player's goal is to get past the rock band and destroy the relic.<br/><br/>Turn Sequence - The Rock Band player chooses one token and moves that rocker any number of hexes in a straight line up to its Move trait. Under most circumstances, rockers cannot enter occupied hexes. After that rocker moves, he may attack. Each token has a unique method of attacking and defeating opponents, e.g. &quot;kill each adjacent demon that has no Hell tokens next to it.&quot; When that rocker's move and attack have been resolved, play proceeds to the Hell player. The Hell player's turn sequence is identical to the Rock Band player's.<br/><br/>Move: Different pieces have different Move values, so the humans have to stay on their toes. Some people are a little quicker than others. We all had that one kid in school who always ended up on our team, but never could pull his own weight. For most of my childhood, I was that kid. Also, demons tend to be a lot quicker than humans. Life's like that.<br/><br/>Attack: After a unit moves, it can then Attack. This is a diceless act that depends entirely on the positioning of your unit.<br/><br/>Win Condition: The rockers are trying to retrieve a relic that they intend to use to free themselves from their contract. I won't ruin the surprise; read the books! Anyway, if the rockers can move the relic off the map, they win! If the demons ever are able to maneuver into a position to destroy the relic, they win!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The main objective is to provide an easy-to-learn regulation, but don&rsquo;t forget the realism and historical accuracy.<br/><br/>Main features:<br/>1 - Rules developed for different scales, from 6mm to 20mm, at Squad level.<br/>2 - Valorization of the chain of command.<br/>3 - An original system of randomized movement of units that are out of the chain of command - a system that can also be easily adapted for solo play.<br/>4 - Range definitions in centimeters and hexagons, allowing games on maps without markings and on maps with hexagonal grids.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An ancient Chinese folk tale recounts that the Jade Emperor once held a feast to which he invited all the animals of the forest. Only twelve showed up. To reward his guests, the Jade Emperor announced that he would name a year of the Zodiac after each. The animals were all duly honored. But then the question of order arose. The Ox, the brawniest of all the animals but also the most dull-witted, insisted he should be first due to his tremendous strength. The Rat, puniest of all the animals but also the most cunning, argued he should be first due to his keen intelligence. The other animals, who possessed both strength and intelligence in varying degrees, soon joined the quarrel. Some sided with the Ox, saying that strength was more important than intelligence. Others sided with the Rat, saying intelligence was more important than strength. While still others wavered back and forth. So to settle the matter, the Rat proposed a contest.<br/><br/>This game uses the twelve animals of the Chinese Zodiac. Each animal possesses its own unique combination of strength and intelligence. During the first phase, strength is crucial; in the second phase, intelligence is valued.<br/><br/>The board starts off empty. The players alternately place their pieces on their sides of the board. Each piece must be placed on the unoccupied yellow spaces within their first three rows. The direction a piece is facing indicates which player it belongs to. After each player has placed all their twelve pieces, the game can begin. North, for having gone second during the set-up stage, gets to move first.<br/><br/>An animal can not capture an animal stronger than itself. The animals are ranked in strength, from strongest to weakest: 12. Ox, 11. Tiger, 10. Dragon, 9. Horse, 8. Dog, 7. Goat, 6. Pig, 5. Snake, 4. Rooster, 3. Monkey, 2. Hare, 1. Rat.<br/><br/>When an animal reaches the far rank, it is removed to the side and scored according to its intelligence. The animals are ranked in intelligence, from smartest to dumbest: 12. Rat, 11. Hare, 10 Monkey, 9. Rooster, 8. Snake, 7. Pig, 6. Goat, 5. Dog, 4. Horse, 3. Dragon, 2. Tiger, 1. Ox. As can be seen, an animal's intelligence is in inverse proportion to its strength. In other words, the weaker the animal the more valuable it is and vice-versa.<br/><br/>Other than this, normal Checkers rules apply. Pieces can only move diagonally forward, either by sliding to an adjacent empty square or by jumping over an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible.<br/><br/>When one player is unable to make a move, by either having no more pieces left on the Checkerboard, or by having all his pieces blocked from movement, the game ends and the player with the higher score wins.<br/><br/>Incidentally, through prudent and skillful play the Rat was able to easily defeat the brute efforts of the Ox. On the Chinese Calendar, the Year of the Rat is first, and Year of the Ox second to this very day.<br/><br/>",

The skills obtained as a result of the game will not only increase social adaptability but also lay the foundation for further personal development. Most of the items on the cards in this set are short stories that tell the background of a fact. The players are asked to determine exactly why this or that consequence took place, and what was its cause. Here are just a few examples of the 100 tasks that players will have to solve in this set:<br/><br/>- In which country are only men citizens?<br/>- In the English city of Bradford, there is the only farm in the world where samples of woolen fabrics are delivered from all UK textile factories. Who is bred on this farm?<br/>&ldquo;What is the use of a tape recorder of a tiger's growl at Bombay Airport?<br/>- In the American state of Arizona, they began to protect the desert from thieves. They steal something without which the desert is threatened with desolation and devastation. what is taken out of the desert?<br/>- Walter Scott said: &quot;Both the crystal and the heart would not be so valuable if ...&quot;<br/><br/>Any number of participants can play the Thinkers board game, but if there are a large number of players, it would be advisable to split into teams. The teams, in turn, take one card with the task, which indicates the topic, difficulty, i.e. the number of victory points, and the task itself. After that, all team members jointly begin the discussion. The complexity of the tasks varies from one to five points, so the developer recommends to allot from 3 to 15 minutes to find solutions, respectively. The team can check the correctness of its answer on the reverse side of the card, then move on to the next team. At the request of the participants, the game can last for a certain time or end immediately after one of the teams scores a predetermined number of points.<br/><br/>",

Thus it is possible to play two games simultaneously on the same board. The first game is played on the Dark squares, and the second game on the Light squares.<br/><br/>Also, the conventional way of playing two games simultaneously is that the player makes a move in the first game, then another move in the second game. However, in 'Persephone' the player picks between either of the two games in which he wants to move a piece. Captures still take precedence over any other move. So a player is forced to make a capture on a particular side of the board if possible.<br/><br/>A player wins when he manages to capture all of his opponents pieces that are on the same color of the checkerboard - either all the Light pieces or all the Dark pieces. With two games at once, the chances of a draw are greatly reduced. If one of the games is undecided, the other game can still be resolved for the win.<br/><br/>The two sides are Iron and Gold. Instead of pieces being referred to as Men and Kings, they are known as Maidens and Queens.<br/><br/>Other than this, the game follows the rules of Spanish Checkers. This is played very much like Anglo-American Checkers, the main difference is that the Queen has a more substantial move along any number of vacant squares, including ones beyond a captured piece. Captures are mandatory. If a player has a choice of captures he must take the greater number of pieces.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player may choose to use the magnifying glass tokens to peak at a card in the grid or a players hand; then, they must play two cards, one face up and one face down, and can play them into the grid or aside.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, all cards are flipped face up and any cards in a row or column which share a suit or rank are removed.  Players earn positive points for cards remaining in the grid and unused tokens, and lose points for cards removed from the grid.  The players can then compare their score to a rubric to see how well they did, from &quot;No comment.&quot; to &quot;Psychic!&quot;<br/><br/>",

Stage your image of the enemy with the right campaign for the right target group and clear away the image of the enemy in a politically correct manner.<br/><br/>&quot;Feindbild&quot; (&quot;Enemy stereotype&quot;) - this is a unique game concept in which the fun of the game scratches the satire. The game can be explained in a few minutes. But you can play it for years. Provided, of course, that our enemy stereotypes do not change by then.<br/><br/>Every player gets a target group to work for. Then five images of the enemy are laid out. And then it is important to stage the enemy images with the right media campaign in such a way that the anger of your own target group begins to boil. And that's about it. Isn't it nice when card games can be explained so easily?<br/><br/>As enemy images there are the bad Russians, the classic terrorists, the scruffy social parasite, the greedy pharmaceutical industry and the corrupt European politician. And of course many more. The target groups are the conservatives, the left and the right and of course the totally confused aluminum hat wearers. And as campaigns there is the regulars' table, the focus on television and the daily press. And of course the satirical portals themselves. That closes the circle.<br/><br/>As is usual with card games, you have to spend money on &quot;Feindbild&quot; in order to play it. Yes, we live in evil capitalism. Another enemy image. The game consists of 106 cards, which consist of 18 enemy images, 8 target groups and 80 campaigns. And there are also instructions for use.<br/><br/>",

Ambush seeks to provide the perfect blend of thrilling action and intense strategy in a game where the tide of battle can be turned in the blink of an eye! Take control of your personal castle and craft the perfect army of goblins, wizards, and knights to attack your opponents and defend your own walls from harm. The goal of the game is to be the last castle standing at the end of the hectic free-for-all.<br/><br/>To do this, players will need to plan and strategize for the Ambush phase, where any card played in the game so far is up for grabs in a mad scramble that has a chance to be triggered at the start of every player&rsquo;s turn. Having the speed and reflexes to grab the best cards first, as well as remembering where the best cards are on the field will be critical in obtaining the upper hand over other players.<br/><br/>Ambush was created as a project for a USC Games class in the fall of 2019 by Michael Ford, Brendan Tighe, Masato Lin, and Tongwei Dai. The team saw some incredible potential in the game, and in the Spring of 2020,a portion of the group reformed and set out to publish and sell the game with the help of USC faculty and developers from other board game start-ups.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

What many may not know is this game has been around for a long time and you really never hear anything about it.<br/><br/>It was originally released in 1979, right after Cheech &amp; Chong&rsquo;s first movie, Up in Smoke. Roach Party was sold in head shops when they began popping up in the 80&rsquo;s. It had great success, sold thousands of copies and was even featured in High Times Magazine. All was good until feds started raiding the shops and merchandise was seized, thus resulting in the disappearance of this really awesome stoner game.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first player to accumulate a COMPLETE STASH. This is done by collecting all four of the ROACH CARDS. These include the BAGGIE, PAPERS, FIRE, and SUPPLIER cards.<br/>Lastly you must acquire the funds to pay your supplier. Once you have all four cards and the funds required pay your supplier, you are the winner of Roach Party.<br/><br/>",

The game is usually full of good (and bad ) emotions, as two main key aspects are timing and, as the name suggests, bluffing.<br/><br/>Each round, players fight each other for one of the many different magical treasures. During one's turn, the player has two choices: either play a card with a symbol of the treasure of the round, or skip the turn, waiting for better opportunities, or simply missing the necessary card to play. Players take turns clockwise, deciding on the best strategy to win the treasure. Once a player holds a treasure for an entire turn, he gets to take it back to his ship and gains its special effect. The game is over, once a player collects 4 different treasures.<br/><br/>The best part of the game is when you feel like a mastermind, like you've outsmarted all of your friends.  While everyone was fighting for the treasure, you were waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Just when one of your friends was about to take the treasure back to his ship, you laugh at his face and curb his expectations, by taking the treasure into your own hands. You feel ecstatic, you are about to win the game. And just at the moment when you think that you had it in the bag... One of your friends starts laughing at your face and you very well know, what's about to come.<br/><br/>",

The game series is set in 1985, in an alternate history of World War III, when the Warsaw Pact armies storm across the border of East Germany in a powerful attempt to seize West Germany and the whole of Free Europe.<br/><br/>Covering even more battles on the North German Plain as well as parts of southern West Germany, We Shall Hold includes playing pieces for NATO nationalities forward-deployed toward the border between East and West Germany, or in the second line in southern Germany. NATO units are included representing the Belgian, Dutch, Canadian, and West German armies. Opposing them are units of two of the nations of the Warsaw PACT: the East Germans and the Soviet juggernaut, both deploying vast numbers of tanks and infantry in an attempt to overwhelm NATO&rsquo;s lines.<br/>Fight hypothetical battles using the stalwart Leopard-C1s and Scimitars of the 4th Canadian Mechanized Brigade Group. Deploy and maneuver Leopard-1s, Scimitars, and Milan-2 armed Jeeps of the Belgian Army. Fiercely defend against hordes of Warsaw PACT armor on the North German Plain using the deadly Leopard-2s of the Dutch Army. Assault the line with long-ranged East Germans T-72 tanks, supported by BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicles, armed with deadly Spandrel anti-tank guided missiles. Mass your Soviet attacking forces for a breakthrough using T-80 main battle tanks, more BMP-2s, Engineers for assault, and self-propelled 120mm mortars.<br/><br/>We provide the scenarios, but YOU are IN COMMAND.<br/><br/>The World At War 85 system features a unique combat system that involves die rolls by both attacking units and defending units, which keeps both players engaged throughout the game. Die rolls are compared and hits are applied quickly, as all the information you need to fight your units is on the counters. No combat results table is necessary. Initiative, random formation activation and turn length; direct, indirect, opportunity and anti-aircraft fire; fire and movement, assault, and close air support; all are integrated smoothly into a fast, easy to play system.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Aggression is different in that it has several possible goals in play simultaneously. All the pieces move and capture the same as one another. Complexity of play is achieved by having a unique win/loss condition tied to each separate piece type. Players must juggle the demands of multiple goals and adjust strategies throughout play.<br/><br/>Pieces have two kinds of movement, a March or a Lunge. A March is a sliding move in a straight line any number of empty squares, like a Chess Queen. A Lunge is a capturing move. The piece jumps over an adjacent enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side. Only one piece can be captured on a turn. Multiple jumps are not allowed.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 7x8 board. On each player's back row, the central space is marked with a flag.<br/><br/>The Blue player goes first. Each player begins with a Scout in hand. On their first turn, a player moves forward one of his Infantry pieces. Then he drops his Scout on any empty square on the board, as long as it is not under attack. After that, each player makes two moves per turn. First moving one of his regular pieces, then moving his Scout.<br/><br/>The Scout and the General are both defensive pieces and have the further restriction of not being allowed to move to a space where they can be attacked. Since there are two moves involved each turn, it is permitted to move the General to a space where it may be jumped by an enemy piece, as long as the Scout immediately moves behind the General to guard it.<br/><br/>The piece types and their winning conditions are:<br/><br/>Scout: [Blockade] A Scout requires freedom of movement to do its job. If a player is able to trap or capture the opponent's Scout so that it has no legal move on its turn, the player wins.<br/><br/>Infantry: [Elimination] If all seven units of the opponent's Infantry are captured, the player wins.<br/><br/>Sapper: [Arrangement] Sappers seek to construct a fortification within enemy territory. 'Enemy territory' is defined as the four rows on the opponent's side of the board. A 'fortification' is three Sappers connected in a row, horizontally or vertically. Diagonally does not count.<br/><br/>Saboteur: [Traversal] A Saboteur seeks to blow up the enemy's Regimental Headquarters. The HQ is the central space located on a player's back row, and is marked with a flag. The player wins if he is able to move the Saboteur safely across the board and on to the opponent's Regimental Headquarters square.<br/><br/>General: [Checkmate] The player wins if they are able to checkmate the opponent's General. As in Chess, if the player's General is in Check, then the player on their next move must get their General out of check, if possible.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A tile placement game for all ages, this intuitive-to-play and fast moving game involves pattern (tile edge) matching and spatial recognition. The game is played with six-sided tiles, each edge having either one, two, three or four pips.<br/><br/>Usually a 2-4 player game, Hexinos can be played by five player (six is unwieldly and its too long between turns).<br/><br/>All players start each turn with two tiles (hidden from the other players). On their turn the player places one of those two tiles onto the game table, matching at least one edge of their six sided tile to a tile edge already on the game table. That placement is immediately scored (see below), the player retrieves another tile from the facedown tilepile and then the player to their left takes their turn. Play continues until all tiles have been placed.<br/><br/>There are two ways of scoring Hexinos tile placement: Basic and Advanced. Basic can be used with younger kids or just to make the game play go a bit faster.<br/><br/>Basic scoring is super basic - if the player matches:<br/><br/>+  one edge of their tile to one edge of a tile already on the game table: score one point<br/><br/>+ two edges of their tile: score three points<br/><br/>+  three edges of their tile: score six points<br/><br/>+ four edges of their tile: score ten points<br/><br/>+  five edges of their tile: score fifteen points<br/><br/>+ all edges of their tile - the &quot;perfect match&quot;: that player wins immediately.<br/><br/>Advanced scoring requires both addition and multiplication:<br/><br/>+  one edge of their tile to one edge of a tile already on the game table: score one point for each pip on that matching edge of the player's tile (e.g. if the matching tile edge has three pips, its three points (not six))<br/><br/>+ two edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by two<br/><br/>+  three edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by three<br/><br/>+ four edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by four<br/><br/>+  five edge match: count total pips on the matching edges of the players tile, then multiply that by five<br/><br/>For both Basic and Advanced scoring - if the placed tile closes off an empty tile space (called &quot;bridging&quot;), the placing player scores as usual for the edges that match, then a bonus of six points for each empty hex that has been closed off.<br/><br/>A note about younger players:<br/>As long as the player can hold and place the tiles, Hexinos can be played at any age. For younger players it encourages both pattern matching and spatial recognition - seeing their tile with an edge with 2 pips next to a 3 pip edge, but does that match what is on the tiles already on the table, or is the 2 &amp; 3 &quot;backwards&quot;? And with the basic scoring system, kids easily grasp the benefit of &quot;more edges matching is better&quot; without needed to know addition or multiplication.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Multiplicity is a pure placement abstract strategy game.<br/><br/>The game starts on an empty hexhex board. White moves first, after which turns alternate. Moving is compulsory.<br/><br/>1. The restricted placement phase<br/><br/>White starts by placing one stone on the empty board. From that point on players take turns to:<br/><br/>Place a stone on a cell adjacent to the last stone placed by the opponent, and ...<br/>    ... place a stone on a cell that has only vacant cells as neighbors.<br/><br/>When the player to move cannot make the second placement of their turn, their turn ends, the restricted placement phase ends, and the free placement phase begins.<br/><br/>2. The free placement phase<br/><br/>Now players take turns placing one stone on any vacant cell.<br/><br/>The game ends when the board has only 1 empty cell remaining. (Now each player has placed the same number of stones.)<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins. A player's score is the product of the sizes of all his groups. Ties are rare but possible.<br/><br/>Several games by Christian Freeling use this &quot;one bound, one free&quot; placement protocol, which he began exploring in 2012.<br/><br/>",

The house was one of your very first investigations after being promoted to Detective. An elderly woman who lived there disappeared for months, inciting a missing person investigation, only to have her turn up a year later in the empty home . . . her head removed. You never did figure out where the woman vanished to in all those months, and you never figured out who killed her. All you know is that after you stepped foot in the house, your life took a turn for the worse. Your wife died, your home burned down, and things never seemed to get better. Now, near retirement and severely alcoholic, you are determined to go back to the house and figure out just what is going on in there once and for all. Somehow, however, you know that whatever is living there . . . it is evil.<br/><br/>There is Something in the House is a simple Roll+Write inspired by Japanese horror media. It is a miniature print and play-style board game with storytelling elements where you take on the role of a retiring police detective. All you need is the 2 game sheets, a pencil, and some dice.<br/><br/>Turn down the lights, turn on some spooky music, and play by candlelight!<br/><br/>",

This line separates the two sides, white against blue.<br/>The goal of the game is to obtain the largest number possible of consecutive signs or of a same symbol. The principle is to put down a pair of cards of same sign in order to be allowed to place a third card on his side of the Zodiac. <br/>It is permitted to place a sign on the line only if it is different from the ones which are already on its side. If the opponent has already placed a card there, then a battle is engaged to determine which player will keep that sign.<br/>For the battle, both players secretly choose a die among their available dice. The dice are thrown and the winner is the player obtaining the highest score. The used dice are then put away.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

But the winner chooses!<br/><br/>1 deck of 53 cards will allow up to 5 players to play,<br/>2 decks, up to 9<br/>etc...<br/><br/>Le Grisbi is made up of 53 game cards and 3 double-sided rule cards.<br/>The 53 cards in the game are divided into 2 categories:<br/><br/>     40 numbered cards (4 series of cards ranging from 1 to 10)<br/>     13 special cards (with super powers)<br/><br/><br/>Game play:<br/><br/>Each player starts with 3 cards face down in front of them covered with 3 cards face up and 3 cards in their hand. The rest of the cards serve as a draw pile.<br/><br/>The first player begins by putting on the table one or more cards of the same value located in her hand. At this point she must draw the number of cards sufficient to have at least three cards in her hand. The next player must put one or more cards of equal or greater value than the previous number card and draw accordingly and so on. If he cannot play or if tactically he finds it more interesting, the player recovers the game pile and starts a new pile. As long as there is a draw pile all players must have at least 3 cards in hand. Otherwise a player can say &quot;Grisbi&quot; and designate the person who does not have 3 cards in hand and this person will have to recover the game pile. The player who said &quot;Grisbi&quot; starts playing again.<br/><br/>Once the draw is completed, players play all the cards they have in their hand. When it is done, the player can recover his new deck by taking the cards face up located in front of him. He plays as before until he has no more cards.<br/> Then, on the third phase, the player, when it is his turn, turns over a card face down at random and places it on the pile. If the played card remains in the rule, the game continues and it is up to the next player. If the placed card does not respect the rule, the player takes the playing pile back into hand and must get rid of it before moving on to the next face down card.<br/><br/>The first to get rid of all his cards wins and the game ends when there is only one player left.<br/><br/>",

There&rsquo;s no other option, but to fight your way out using your Kung-Fu skills.<br/><br/>In Hand2Hand you play as one of two Kung-Fu crime fighters, using your martial art skills to neutralise the enemy threat.<br/><br/>The game is played until either one player is hit by an enemy (they lose), or the players knock out 18 enemies (the player&rsquo;s win).<br/><br/>The game is played over several rounds. In each round a D6 is rolled to determine where the new enemies spawn. The players then select, in private, which new action card to play.<br/><br/>Once the round has been setup, the players can discuss the sequence of actions to play. The main restriction is that the actions must be taken alternatively (left player, right player, left player, etc.). There are other restrictions, such as:<br/>&bull; a player can only perform up to 2 actions per round,<br/>&bull; an action may only be used once,<br/>&bull; the targeted enemy must be adjacent to the action card,<br/>&bull; actions cost cubes, meaning some actions prevent a player from taking a second action.<br/><br/>The key point is that few of the actions let you directly knock-out an enemy, you must use the enemies&rsquo; attacks against each other. There are three types of enemy:<br/><br/>&bull; Unarmed enemies cannot knock-out (discard) another enemy, they can only knock-down (flip over),<br/>&bull; Knife Wielding enemies can knock-out any enemy,<br/>&bull; Gun Wielding enemies can knock-out any enemy, but they cannot be blocked (placing a cube on the enemy card), and some player actions cannot be used on them.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to be the aristocrat who invests the most in the HMRS Endeavour.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to have the most money invested in HMRS Endeavour. The game is played in turns. Each turn the player draws two, double sided location cards and then places them in sequence from the current location card. The player choose the order and the side of the placement in order to optimise the actions they want to activate. Then as the ship travels from the current location to the next location the matched actions are executed.<br/><br/>Actions include:<br/>&bull; Gathering Intelligence. This is used to active black market actions.<br/>&bull; Training. This is used to improve actions you execute.<br/>&bull; Strike a Deal. This is used to increase your money.<br/>&bull; Invest in the Rocket. This is how you win the game.<br/><br/>Instead of executing the matched actions, you can spend the intelligence you have gathered to execute a black market action. These allow you to spoil another player&rsquo;s deal, improve your own deal, or to cash out of a deal early. The cost of executing a black market action is that the location banishes the Endeavour from its orbit.<br/><br/>The game ends when 1 player has an undefeatable investment in HMRS Endeavour.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",
