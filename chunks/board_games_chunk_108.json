But there's a problem: the part-timers working at the store don't think the manager is going to pay them properly, and they've challenged her to a magical duel, with their salaries on the line! But if the store doesn't stay open, no one gets paid at all. Can the workers prevail with victory uncertain, and their salaries at stake?<br/><br/>Magical Bakery - Magical Girl Rebellion is the sequel to Magical Bakery - I'm the Manager, and the third game in the Magical Bakery series, with its own unique gameplay.<br/><br/>One player is the manager, and the other 1-3 players play as the workers in a magical duel. The workers want to win their pay, but the manager's goal is not to pay them anything, and the manager has powerful magic conferring a significant advantage. Over the course of ten rounds, the workers and manager select magic cards, and then secretly pass them to the manager, who will then declare who won the round - but once per game, the manager can lie! If the workers catch them in a lie, they win the round, and if the workers win three rounds out of the ten, they win.<br/><br/>",

With the fire dice you break ice from the floe and gain it.

Also, there is an Ave Caesar like pit stop requirement forcing drivers to decide whether to make a pit stop on the first or second lap (pit stops on the third lap require an extra lap to finish the race.) Once the decision is made, it then becomes a matter of planning to get to pit row.<br/><br/>",

For instance, to start, you need to roll 2-5; then to clear the water jump, 6-9; then for the brick wall, 10-12.  To clear the logs at the end, you need to roll doubles.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Ride-em Cowboy (a rodeo game for 1-4 players) is a game in which it is appropriately difficult to score well.  Appropriately for simulating a rodeo, players often won't stay on the bronco long enough to score, but, on the other hand, occasionally someone will ride the whole way out.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Ride the High Country is just a basic roll-and-move game for 2-4 players.<br/><br/><br/>",

Oh yes, under the garden gnome and there, beside the watering can. <br/>Bella and Bello run about tirelessly, burrowing here and digging there...<br/>The one who guides them over the lawn skilfully and is first to dig up the bone for Isabella together with them wins the game.<br/><br/>This game is played with two &quot;dogs&quot;, wooden balls with ears attached to them, which are placed in a box which has several holes in the bottom. Each hole is marked by an item: watering can, a garden gnome, etc.<br/><br/>In the standard version of the game, a pile of cards each displaying two items is placed in the middle of the table. The active player takes the box and tries to roll the two dogs in the holes with marked with the items on the top card. If he succeeds, he gets to keep the card. In the meantime, his neighbour is repeatedly rolling a die which has a dog on one side. If he rolls the dog, then the active player's turn is over. The first player to gather three cards wins the game.<br/><br/>In the no-dice version all cards are arranged next to each other on the board. On each card, a burrowing chip is placed, face down. Some of these chips show a bone, others do not. When it is a player's turn, the tries to move the dogs into two holes, and then gets to inspect the burrowing chip on the card corresponding to the holes that the dogs have gone in. If the chip shows a bone, he gets to keep it, otherwise it is returned to the card. When there are only eight chips left on the card, the game ends, and the player with the most bones wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Torn Armor is a fantasy squad-based tactical miniatures board game for 2-4 players. Based in the mythical World of Torn, it presents the lore, races, people, heroes, and history to players through the use of game-play scenarios. The core set focuses on the conflicts between two factions:<br/><br/>The Sisk Empire: an expansionist society, believing that their advanced culture and religious ideology are something from which everyone can benefit. Unfortunately their war-machine is thinly stretched, over-taxed, and on the brink of collapse. They seek wealth, raw materials, technology and slaves.<br/><br/>The Maychians: anthropomorphic creatures that live in the so-called &quot;New Continents&quot; in the northern hemisphere. Their land is an undiscovered country, full of untapped resources and ancient ruins. The Maychians possess primitive technology, but are fervent in their desire to defend their homeland and resist the Sisk invasion.<br/><br/>Included in the core set are 39 highly-detailed miniatures, 12 unit stat cards, a full color rule book, full color scenario book, 4 double-sided color battle posters, 8 Magical Item cards, 8 Spell cards and 25 dice of 5 different colors.<br/><br/>The battle for Torn World begins as the Sisk explorers land on the beaches of the &quot;New Continents&quot; with the intent to discover and claim ancient magical relics from a forgotten age. But the Maychians have spotted the intruders and are ready to stop them at any cost! Which faction will prevail? Only you can decide!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is about the Castle of S. Jorge, a castle that is in the centre of Lisbon and has more than 1.000 years of history.<br/><br/>In this long history, the Castle has had several masters and has known all kind of characters. From the iron age Chief to the last King of Portugal, from the Roman Governor to the Arabic Sultan, from Kings to Scientists, from Navigators to Middle Age Writers, all of these have marked their presence in the Castle and their history is vivid in our memories still today.<br/><br/>In this game, 12 of the most prominent characters that have lived in the Castle dispute a tournament. This tournament happens only each 1.000 years, and the winner will reign over the Castle for the next 1.000 years.<br/><br/>To win this tournament, each character must walk around the board paths and some secret passages, and collect and preserve 3 S. Jorge Trophies. But be careful with the false trophies, they weight on you and slow you down.<br/><br/>You also have to be aware of other characters: if they encounter you, they may steal your trophies. Or you may steal theirs. Or you may discard some of your &quot;non-valid&quot; trophies on their back. Or the opposite. Anyway, something may happen.<br/><br/>And, of course, you have a special ability. Something that only you can do. How to take the most of it, that's your job.<br/><br/>",

Most cards contain an unpleasant dare which you or your opponent are required to perform,  Failure to perform the dare satisfactorily leads to a move forward as directed down the lavatory system.  Other cards allow you to fend off dares, miss turns or simply move any opponents piece you choose.  To prevent players from hoarding cards, any player who holds more than three cards at the start of their turn must move forward six spaces.  The winner of the game is the player LEAST far down the system when his first opponent arrives in the sewage works at the end.<br/><br/>",

They all want to follow their mother in order to be good ducks, so they try to keep pushing their way to the front of the line &ndash; and with your help, they'll make it there!<br/><br/>To set up the game, place the twenty color tiles face down in the center of the table, then place the mama duck, with the three baby ducks in a row behind her. On a player's turn, she reveals the color of one of the face-down tiles. If it matches the color of the duck at the back of the line, she keeps the tile and scoots the duck forward so that it's right behind its mother. The player takes another turn, searching for a tile to match the color of the duck now at the back of the line. If the player doesn't find a tile of the proper color, her turn ends.<br/><br/>Once the final tile has been claimed from the center of the table, the game ends. Whoever has collected the most tiles wins!<br/><br/>",

The grid shows project locations, matching the 14 project tiles, coded 'Project A' through 'Project N'. Every project square shows the potential maximum points that a single player can gain from that project.<br/><br/>Game Play:<br/>Lay project tiles on a board, and surround them with expertise tiles. When a project has enough expertise, it is completed, and the player that contributed the most expertise wins.<br/><br/>During their turn, players throw the die and move the round-marker along the game-board as many spaces as the die indicates. Depending on the place the round-marker ends on, one of several things may happen. Sometimes a project tile may be drawn from the draw bag and placed on the board. Or the active player may draw one expertise chip from the faced-down set and place it on the board. In order to do this, they must move their score marker backwards on the track as many places as is indicated on the expertise chip that they have drawn. Another option would be drawing a play-card, which are similar to Monopoly chance cards.<br/><br/>When a project has enough expertise added to it (by placing expertise chip next to it) players see who gets how many points from their contributions. They then move their score marker forwards on the track the same number of points that they have collected from the project. The expertise chip attached to the project do not recycle back into the draw pile.<br/><br/>The game ends when either a per-determined number of rounds (based on the number of players) has been played or when all projects have been completed or when all expertise chips have been used up.<br/><br/>Note:<br/>This game was supported by the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management.<br/><br/>",

Nobody knows what is the purpose of the items they encountered. Yet, the astronauts have to give discoveries appropriate names as soon as possible due to the request of the mighty press syndicate being a sponsor of the expedition. The public is waiting for more news about expedition findings and scientists, threatened by news mogul with financial cuts, must act quickly&hellip;<br/><br/>Overview:<br/><br/>&ldquo;Planet Nomino&rdquo; is a family party game where players match bizarre names to even stranger objects.<br/><br/>In each round the players reveal a thing, put the spinning top in motion and then discuss the best names for it. In order to win player may need to convince other researchers that one of the picks is the best (even if it is obviously the worst one!). As soon as the spinning top stopped, they vote for each proposal and score according to the result of the ballot.<br/><br/>There are two modes of play: Simple, for young scientists, and basic, for more experienced astronauts.<br/><br/>In simple mode the player gets the points if she or he voted for most popular name (the one, which according to player&rsquo;s opinion fits the object best and thus got majority of the votes).<br/><br/>In basic mode there is one more twist added. Each player gets each round new character card. Each character pursues own secret agenda and gains points if specific names had or had not been used (even if these were better choices than others).<br/><br/>The game continues until a player reaches 7 victory points.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, plastic chips which show one of four serial killers are placed face down on the cities. Players choose their detective and place it anywhere on the map. There are also four cards with images of the four killers; the top one of these is flipped open.<br/><br/>The active player rolls two dice which show chess pieces. If the two dice show different symbols, the player can move his/her detective the corresponding moves (i.e., any distance diagonal for a bishop). If the two rolls are the same, though, a new killer card is flipped open. If a player lands on a chip, the chip is flipped over - if it shows the same killer as the card, the player can either score points or flip over other chips with the same killer. If s/he makes a mistake, though, all points from that turn are lost. If the killer doesn't match the card, it is just returned and the players try to remember its location.<br/><br/>When two detectives meet, they duel each other (higher die roll wins); the winner looking at a chip and placing the loser anywhere on the board.<br/><br/>When all 16 killer chips have been collected (&quot;all cases solved&quot;), the game ends and the player with most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dirty Pictures styles itself as a mature guess-the-drawing game for 3 or more players.<br/><br/>Each player is given an amount of time (indicated by a sandtimer) to take his or her turn to score points.  The player moves his or her piece on the result of a die roll, then draws a card from the deck corresponding to the landed space.  He or she then starts drawing out a sketch about the Word or Phrase without saying anything; gestures are allowed.  He or she scores 5 points when another player guesses correctly the Word or Phrase.  The active player continues the roll-draw-sketch process until the timer expires.  The next player then begins his or her turn.<br/><br/>The first player to score a total of 100 points wins and ends the game.<br/><br/>",

With their simple rules and the excitement of rivalry, memory games appeal to both children and adults, and older players do not necessarily have an advantage over younger ones. Ever since they first appeared in the 1950s, games that involve looking for pairs of identical objects have enjoyed unflagging popularity and thousands of versions have been produced. While Memory &rsquo;39 continues this long tradition, it also introduces a certain element of novelty.<br/>Designed by the Institute of National Remembrance, this game not only improves the players&rsquo; power of concentration but also helps them to memorize the events of 1939 that are so important for Polish national identity. Memory &rsquo;39 makes use of archival photographs illustrating Poland&rsquo;s 1939 war of defense. A historical commentary on each photograph is provided in the enclosed brochure. Together with the commentary, the photographs tell a short history of the September campaign. To make the distant events more vivid, the black-and-white photographs have been tinted with great attention to historical detail.<br/><br/>The box contains:<br/>&ndash; 48 game cards with archival photographs<br/>&ndash; a brochure with historical commentaries on the photographs<br/><br/>(From back cover)<br/><br/>",

Unlike most such variants for children (for instance Yahtzee Jr. which in Swedish has the same name as this game), in this one you do not keep a record of categories chosen in previous rounds. Instead each round involves rolling and aiming afresh for one of five categories: two pairs (2p), three of a kind (3p), full house (5p), four of a kind (7p) or five of a kind (10p). After ten rounds, points are added up to determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players take on the role of startup founders to create &quot;the next big thing&quot;, bootstrapping using their initial cash savings and superpower skills (i.e. programming, design, sales, marketing, etc.) to create a minimal viable product, gain initial traction, and then go on to raise multiple rounds of capital from investors, increasing the value of their company, but while also having their founder's ownership get diluted.<br/><br/>During the game players will experience many of the ups and downs of the entrepreneurial journey including: increasing revenues while balancing against expenses to grow the company, various significant events (good and bad), and creating an impact that changes the world. There are also multiple paths such as an accelerator path, pivot paths, and in the end (if you haven't gone bankrupt) players decide to either take the acquisition path or IPO path. Along the way players also collect impact points, as it's not just about the money, from sustainability, ethics &amp; diversity, social impact, and health &amp; wellness. The winner is the player who exits (&quot;cashes out&quot;) with the most money by creating the company with the largest valuation while still maintaining the most founder's ownership and generating the most positive impact on the world.<br/><br/>",

Players move on a modular board comprised of 9 sections, 6 hexagons and 3 obtuse &quot;L&quot;s, to capture the prize pieces on each section. The cards, board sections and prize pieces are suppurated into three categories; Reflected Images, Mixed Images and, Impossible Figures.<br/><br/>The active player roles the die and moves; if he/she lands on an Illusion space, they draw an illusion card and pick whether they see &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;; the cards have illusions on them that can be seen in two ways, e.g. do you see A: the two faces looking at each other or B: the goblet. The player indicates which they saw, using a hidden disc marked A and B, then the player next to him/her announces which way they believe the active play saw the image, the active player then reveals the disc. Each card has instructions on the back, one for both A and B, that will help or hurt a player. If the announcing player was correct, they choose who must follow the instruction otherwise the active player chooses.<br/><br/>Prize pieces must be landed on exactly and, once a player wins a prize piece they may move the part of the board it was on. This can be used to break the board into separate sections, stranding opponents. The rules vary based on the number of players playing but, collecting a requisite number and type of prize pieces wins the game.<br/><br/>",

(P.S. Hex!)<br/><br/>On a turn, a player chooses one knight on the game board, then jumps one or more knights with it in succession. When a knight jumps, it lands on one of the three hexes (if empty) on the opposite side of the knight jumped, then the player captures the jumped knight, leaving an empty space that can be landed in during future jumps &ndash; even during that same turn. A player must make at least one jump, if possible, on her turn, but she is not compelled to make more than one.

The longer the sequence, the more you score. Here's a quick example:<br/><br/>Category 1 = &quot;Transportation&quot; - Item 1 = &quot;CAR&quot;  <br/>Category 2 = &quot;Vegetables&quot; - Now try to think of a vegetable that contains &quot;CAR&quot;? If you said, &quot;CARROT&quot; you would score 3 points because C+A+R are 3 matching letters in sequence, common to both CAR and CARrot. If the Transportation Category item was AIRPLANE and you responded with the Vegetable - EGGPLANT, that would score 4 points because P+L+A+N are letters in sequence and in common to both airPLANe and eggPLANt.<br/><br/>In the game, one player turns over a category card and names 3 items from that category. After each player has written these items in the left column of their answer sheet, a second category card is revealed. All players then have one-and-a-half minutes to find Common Ground. The player with the highest score advances. During the game, players use strategic option cards to challenge their opponents and advance along the board toward victory, but get ready for instant verbal challenges that occur whenever landing on an opponent's space.<br/><br/>",

In each series there are two sets of cards, Monsters or Warriors (Characters) and Spells or Weapons (Specials).  Spells are used by Monsters to increase their fighting strength; likewise Warriors use Weapons.&quot;<br/><br/>The Character Cards are printed with attack and defense values, and the Specials have either an attack or a defense value.  All have some artwork and (tongue-in-cheek) text.  The Character Cards also have scratch-off areas.<br/><br/>During the game each player has a hand of 5 cards and a deck of 15.  The first player attacks with 1, 2 or 3 Character cards and some number of Special cards, and the other tries to defend against each attacking Character by laying down a Character and Specials having the same or higher value.<br/><br/>The unique feature is that, according to the rules, each losing Character has a scratch-off area removed, which shows a new and &quot;almost always&quot; weaker attack or defense value.  The final scratch-off is always zero, at which time the card &quot;needs replacing&quot;.  So not only are the cards collectible, they are also destructible!<br/><br/>",

In twenty solar cycles, the sun will explode and destroy everything in our solar system. Use the remaining resources of our planet to construct your ship in orbit. Build it fast. Build it strong. Build it to save as many humans as you can and launch your spaceship to the nearest exoplanet before the supernova.<br/><br/>Constructing your ship is only half the game. For those that survive the solar event and launch their ships, they must face new challenges on the way to our new exoplanet home, Earth 667C. The Journey to the new planet has boosts and perils along the way, including black holes, quasars, enemy vessels, and asteroid fields. Your ship building skills and the luck of the dice combine to determine your crew and survivors' fates. Will you be the first to Earth 667C?<br/><br/>Earth 667C is a card and turn-based tabletop game for 2-6 players or teams. Perfect for ages 10 and up, the game is fun, encourages strategic thinking, and includes just enough chance and player relationship dynamics to create three game phases with unique challenges.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Ship Building<br/>Purchase Ship Components from Space Dock, and construct the fastest ship carrying the most people. Customize your ship by doubling your navigation for better travel. Double your engineering department for increased speed. Or, add more food and life support to increase your capacity to carry survivors. Pick your strategy for your ship and start building. Optional Ship Components are available for purchase. Components like weapon systems, shuttle bays, and radiation shield provide bonuses or protection during The Journey.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Launch Your Ship<br/>When the Solar Cycle hits 8, you can launch your fully constructed spaceship. Roll the dice and aim for 12 or higher to push your ship into position for The Journey. Get 12 or lower? Then you must wait, and hope that the solar clock does not tick down any further. You must launch your ship before the clock hits zero, and the sun goes supernova.<br/><br/>Phase 3: The Journey<br/>When the clock hits zero and sun engulfs the Earth, the real Journey begins. Play a single turn journey, or an eight turn journey. Roll the dice and discover what boosts and perils await you while traveling to humanity's new exoplanet home. Encounter new enemies that attack and slow your ship, or pass a strong hydrogen cloud that boosts your engines. Utilize your optional Ship Components to ward off enemies or discover wormholes to increase your speed. This phase will put your ship building skills to the test. The events during The Journey can slow the fastest ship, and propel others to victory.<br/><br/>Be the first ship with the most survivors to reach Earth 667C and ensure the survival of the human race on our new exoplanet home!<br/><br/>",

Since perfection is all but impossible to achieve, I decided to design all-inclusive or 'peri-' games, Jigsol' is the first of the series.<br/><br/>Designed to play with more versatility and challenge than any other word game, Jigsol' is ideal for any player who can spell 24 words or more. For those who are curious, a Jigsol is a 'jigsaw solution'. Jigsol is a legal word when playing this game.<br/>-E.M.W.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 25 letters printed on hexagons, the timer is started and each player tries to form an interlocking word puzzle. When the time is up each player calculates his points. When all 25 letters are used a player receives a delta mark on the score sheet (small triangle) and 25 points. The game ends when someone gets 5 or more deltas, or at 200, 500 or more points.<br/><br/>",

No analysis paralysis.  Players pretty much have to shoot from the hip or, that is to say, use their intuition.<br/><br/>A second edition was published and the meta-game of this edition was to intuitively figure out the exact date and time of that release.

Longest shot is #1, shortest is #4, etc. Pre-designated spots for each shot are on the hole cards, with &quot;par minus 2&quot; sets of spots per hole. Bid to avoid the trouble locations - behind trees, or in the sand or water or out-of-bounds - or being too far from the pin. Pre-planning is important on the longer holes, as some types of trouble are worse than others (penalty strokes), and because there will be multiple secret bids on the par 4's and 5's.<br/><br/>When you do get in trouble, roll the die and consult the hazard chart. Keep track of all shots/rolls/penalties - maximum is 3-over par per hole.<br/><br/>After everyone has gotten to the green, then they get to use the plastic putting green. By placing a marble somewhere behind the line designating their 'distance' to putt, they try to get the marble to roll into the hole!<br/><br/>",

The game is competitive; you may choose to play PILGRIMAGE One Way, in which case the first player or team to arrive in Jerusalem wins. Or you may choose to play PILGRIMAGE Round Trip, in which the game is won by the first player or team to reach Jerusalem and return to London.<br/><br/>PILGRIMAGE is a game of chance, played with dice, pawns and Bane and Blessing cards which are drawn as the game proceeds. The events described on these cards have been collected through careful historical research.<br/><br/>PILGRIMAGE One Way takes an hour or more to play, depending on the number of players. The game is designed for 2 to 6 people, ages eight to adult.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game has interesting ideas, especially in the manner you accrue track. The locomotive shaped board has many segments. In your turn you must move to an adjacent segment and you can then take the track allowed by the new segment that you are in. Furthermore, next turn, you cannot move back into the segment you were in at the start of your last turn (In other words, you cannot go to and from between the same two segments). However, it is possible to impede an opponent because no two players may be in the same segment. As up to six can play, this board can get pretty crowded. In each segment (except for two special symbols) there are images that relate to the piece of track you receive. This track is laid on the tabletop area, there is no board on which they are to be placed. Therefore, your direction and length of track is only limited by the size of your table!<br/><br/>Track received must be added to one of your lines immediately. The objective is to build three independent lines that end up with a black tile (a station). When one player has achieved this, the game ends and you score a point for every track tile on your network. The most points, wins (note that this might not be the player that ended the game).<br/><br/>",

One box contained the basic components to play and the other contained the specific components required to play the 1998/1999 race season. With the modular boards, just about any race course the Tour de France covers could be duplicated.<br/> Each rider stats card will determine if they are a star rider, mountain or sprint specialist or a good all around rider. These cards are based on real rider&rsquo;s stats. At the start of the game each player will build a team of 9 players that includes one star rider and the team you build to support him.<br/> The box came with four rule sets: Danish, German, French &amp; English.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This fantasy tile placement game has similar mechanics like DeathMaze (1979), or Citadel of Blood (1980). Heroes go into dungeons and fight monsters they spot. But Wladca Podziemi has some differences to titles mentioned above.<br/><br/>1. All characters are in fellowship. They go together and don't fight against each other. If there is only one player - he leads all characters.<br/>2. Characters fight in formations. First line can use short weapons. Second line must use long range weapons, and cast spells. Last line don't fight this battle, but are safe from monster attacks.<br/><br/>In fact, characters in game - are heroes from Fellowship of the Ring (LoTR), and the labyrinth they explore - is Moria. Even the hardest boss is called Balrog. But this is unofficial LoTR inspiration.<br/><br/>",

It's your job to supply her with the wool from her flock of happy sheep; the fleece of four sheep will meet her needs.<br/><br/>However, she only wants wool of one colour- either black or white. And since her sheepdog Fang ran off with a Bichon Frise last year, those four sheep will need to be within arms reach for you to gather them in.<br/><br/>Will you be the one who gathers the four sheep first, thereby winning Aunt Dolly&rsquo;s biggest smile- and the biggest scone?<br/><br/>Happy Sheep is a fast, fun game of strategy, memory and bluffing. It takes 15 seconds to set up, two minutes to learn, and five minutes to stop laughing when you trick someone into crying &quot;Happy Sheep&quot; and proving they don&rsquo;t know black from white.<br/><br/>Includes strategies for gamers and a simple variant for very young kids.<br/><br/>How to play: <br/>Mix the 20 tiles (10 black, 10 white) face down and form them into a 4x5 flock. On their turn, a player slides out one tile and looks at it. If it's one of the 4 show-off sheep, they show everyone and put it back in the same place. Otherwise, they may rejoin the sheep to the flock face-down wherever they please.<br/><br/>As soon as any player thinks they know where four sheep of the same colour are in a 2x2 group, they yell &quot;Happy Sheep&quot; and turn over the four tiles. If they're right, they win; if not, they're out and play continues.<br/><br/>It sounds simple, but with other players moving tiles, bluffing and sabotaging, it's easy to get beaten to the win or tricked into calling incorrectly.<br/><br/>For strategic players, the backs of the tiles come in with and without daisies, so by some careful calculation it is possible to improve your decisions...<br/><br/>",

First one to the finish wins!<br/><br/>Object: Be the first to get a &quot;horse&quot; peg to the finish line<br/>Rules: Each player selects a color. Players alternate turns rolling the single die. From the starting position move a peg the number of holes as on the dice roll. Note that SOME of the holes in the board have no bottom. A horse that lands here will fall through he board into the box and be out of the game. Player must then start at the beginning with a new horse. Winner is the first person to reach the last hole on an exact roll, or if a player loses all his pegs, the remaining player is the winner.<br/>Alternate play rules: You may enter more than 1 horse of your color on the board. You must make a legal move every roll, and 2 horses cannot occupy the same hole.<br/><br/>",

The backside displays small neutral islands. So every player starts with one of the small countries instead of a big one and can expand quickly. This will cause heavy attacks at the front line to allow supply setup next to the front line.<br/><br/>Additonally this board can be used to enlarge the playing field of Stratak Wars: Der Auftakt / The Beginning together with additional boards 5/7 and 6/8 to a playing field with 9 boards.<br/><br/>So a large continent with a coastal border or a large area with an inland sea can be created. If a playing field with an inland sea is created, the landing ships can use their advantages against tanks because of their speed to build bridgeheads with loaded tanks on opposite countries. Beside tanks, fighters, bombers and ownership counters, infantry units are included as well.<br/><br/>Anything else is similar to Stratak Wars: Der Auftakt / The Beginning<br/><br/>The objective is to conquer most of the cities within a playing time as agreed at the beginning of the game. So the playing time is flexible and can be decided by the players.<br/><br/>Each player starts with his own small state on the edge of the gameboard and expands his influence by conquering cities and other small states on the playing field.  Depending on the units he chooses for combat, he has advantages against the units of other players which are influenced by the landscape as well concerning movement and combat.<br/><br/>Supply points are gained for recently conquered cities only. So you have to move forward, if you want to expand your armies.<br/><br/>The rules include basic rules, advanced rules, alternative rules, a sequence of play description, a display section for the landscapes, cities and a counter description.<br/><br/>",

Each game box includes a special deck of bean-shaped UNO cards, Jelly Belly jelly beans and special rules that sweeten the play.&quot;<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>54 cards<br/>3.5 oz. Jelly Belly jelly beans (5 flavors)<br/><br/>Compared to a standard Uno deck, there are half as many cards, with only one Wild and one Wild Draw Four but still four zeroes.  The rules state that when you force someone to draw cards (with a Draw 2 or wild Draw 4) you can take that many beans from the source pile.  If you collect 10 beans, you may immediately discard all cards but one in your hand.<br/><br/>",

You take the role of brave fishermen, who send their ships to fish and to hunt marine animals at the White sea. You have information about fish stocks, you should wisely use it and send your ships to the best fishing places. You can also try to get ahead of your rivals, by going further than any other into the sea and getting the biggest catch. But don&rsquo;t forget, that sea weather often changes and the storm can cause damage to your ship!<br/>Moreover, in those old times, the only way to keep the catch was to salt fish in barrels. So, along with fish, the Pomors need salt. If your options are limited at the moment, you can stop fishing and sell your salt to the other fishermen. If you correctly set the salt price, you will not only repair your broken ships but also get good earnings.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;A dice game shaped for tactics&quot;<br/><br/>A follow-up to the 2016 game Kivi (Finnish for &quot;stone&quot;). It's Yahtzee again with a game board instead of score sheets, but this time we have 5 dice instead of 6, the dice have six different symbols in two different colours instead of pips, and the game board grid is 5x5 instead of 7x7.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Kivi Shapes is a tactical game of dice where the players score points by building lines of consecutive stones. The dice decide where a stone can be placed: The shapes on the dice should match a combination of shapes on the game board. A minimum of three stones in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row are required to get points. Should you stake on your own row or block another player's game? When the game board is filled with stones, the game ends and it is time to find out who has the most points.<br/><br/>Kivi Shapes extends the Kivi game series: Easier tally and bigger parts are better suited even for younger players. Award-winning Kivi quality!<br/><br/>Contents: Game board, 5 dice with symbols, 64 stones<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chaos and Order clash, and the fate of the world of Run hangs in the balance. Choose sides and fulfill your destiny!<br/><br/>The Chronicles of Run is a two-player game based in a fantasy world, based in abstract strategy and tile placement.<br/><br/>At the begining of the game players take their cards, tokens and screens. They create the world of Run by placing the hexagonal land tiles. Lands are divided in two zones, one for attackers and a second for defenders, and they have a different importance in the game that is represented by its points of power.<br/><br/>In each turn players choose and place one rune token (that represents a hero with a different value of fate) on a land tile free. After both sides have played, tokens are revealed, their cards placed aside and their skills applied.<br/><br/>Runes represent very powerful skills that can modify the position of characters, boost them or win a challenge against an specific opponent. This allows a great variety of tactics and tricks to overcome your opponent's minions.<br/><br/>This process is repeated until all the lands have a hero of each side (Order or Chaos). Then challenges are resolved in each land around the world. The hero with more fate wins the challenge, and its controlling player gets the points of power from that land.<br/><br/>After all challenges are done the game ends, and the player that achieves more points of power wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cloister Games is a nicely presented compilation of four medieval games, typical of those found etched onto monastery floors.  Fox and Geese is played on a board instantly recognizable to us as solitaire. The single Fox wins by jumping over the geese, landing on an empty point and thereby diminishing the flock until it is no longer viable. The geese win by hemming in the fox  so he cannot move. It's not easy to win as the geese. The fascinating game of Merels is better known as Nine Mans Morris and has an entry to itself elsewhere in this database. Albuquerque is perhaps the pick of the bunch, with a strategy resembling a cross between draughts and Merels and its influence is clearly to be seen in modern derivatives such as Kensington. Finally, Fierges is identical to draughts but without the compulsion (huffing) rule.  Each  game is eminently playable in its own right and, together, provide a fascinating insight into the development of modern draughts (checkers). The four boards are beautifully illuminated in medieval style and accompanied by wooden pieces.<br/><br/>",

The fields on the card are numbered and have to be covered one by one.<br/><br/>Do you reach the red field on the board, then you can place a chip on the card of your choice. On the blue field you can exchange a chip of your color from your supply for a white one. The white chips have a special function. During your turn only one colored chip can be placed, but on that same turn several white chips can be placed on the same card. Instead of a colored chip you can also play one white chip. White chips are neutral and don't belong to any player once they are placed.<br/><br/>When a figurine arrives at an already occupied field, the new arrival has to discard one of his chips. After that the player can continue his turn.<br/><br/>There is a scoring as soon as the last field of a card is covered. The player who has placed the last colored chip on that card gets the card. After that, the opposite card goes to the player who has placed the last colored chip on that card.<br/><br/>The chips that were on those cards leave the game. New cards are placed.<br/><br/>The game ends when no one has any chips left. The winner is the player with the highest total value on his gained cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Over the 1982-1983 Christmas holiday, Demian Freeling's father, famed abstract game designer Christiaan Freeling, suggested to his then seven-year-old son that he should design a chess-like game using a seven-by-seven board and seven yet to be defined pawns on the second rank and a royal piece in the middle. Drawing on his own experience with Chess and Xiang-Qi, Demian came up with Congo in just over an hour's time. Games tend to be fairly quick and bloody.<br/><br/>Set on an African Savannah with a river running horizontally across the board, the central royal piece is, of course, a lion, and a player wins by capturing the opposing lion. Lions move by stepping one space in any direction, but (except to capture the opposing lion for the win, which it can do by facing the opposing lion on an open file) is confined to the three-by-three area in the middle of its side of the board.<br/><br/>Reading the initial setup across the first rank, there is a zebra that moves and captures like a Chess knight. Next is a crocodile that can move and capture by stepping one space in any direction or may race all the way to the river on an open file or may swim horizontally within the river along its entire unobstructed length. Next comes an elephant that moves and captures by jumping one or two squares orthogonally. Next is the lion, then another elephant. Next is a monkey that moves by stepping one space in any direction or captures (possibly repeatedly) by jumping over pieces by a short leap (i.e., the monkey's capturing movement is like the piece movement in Halma, but with immediate capture). Last comes the giraffe, which can jump one or two steps in any direction or capture by jumping onto pieces two spaces away in any direction. Like animals on opposing sides are lined up opposite their counterparts.<br/><br/>The second rank on each side is filled with un-promoted pawns that move and capture by stepping one space straight or diagonally forward, and may (but only from across the river) also retreat one or two spaces straight backward without capture. Pawns promote to a super-pawn upon reaching the last rank, and may additionally move and capture one space horizontally or retreat one or two spaces diagonally backward from any space on the board. Any piece except the crocodile may only stay in the river for one turn, after which it drowns if not moved further.<br/><br/>",

The game is played on a board depicting 60 fields, arranged in a circle. Each field has a colour corresponding to a category; every sixth field is a large scoring field.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he rolls the die and moves his pawn as many spaces in the direction he chooses. He is then asked a question from the category of the field he landed on. If he answers the question correctly, he gets to move again.<br/><br/>If a player lands on a scoring field and manages to answer the question correctly, he not only gets to move again, but he also receives a century chip of the correct colour (if he doesn't have one in that colour yet). The first player to collect century chips of all colours wins the game.<br/><br/>The game can be expanded by adding questions from the various editions of Spel van het Jaar (Game of the Year).<br/><br/>",

He put all his supplies into the sewer to protect them from tractor beams. Little did we know, zombies would soon infest the sewers and slowly take over your town.<br/><br/>Run, Dive and Dash your way past Zombies in the sewers. Find the hidden treasures of gas and food and barter your way out of town. If you are lucky enough, you might even find old Earl or his crash test dummy in your fun and crazy adventures.<br/><br/>This 1-4 player game is rated 13+ and comes with an easy to play rule book and personal deck with unique zombies to plague your adventures.<br/><br/>Single Player:<br/><br/>Game play revolves around running through the sewers to collect enough gas and food to barter with so you can get a ride out of town. Sounds easy right? We recommend you try to be careful because there is a limited amount of cards in the deck. The zombies will pop out of you, give you hugs and then go back into the deck. This creates a fun, creative and fun horde mechanic that is both simple and exciting. Can you get all you need before you have nothing left but zombies left in your deck?<br/><br/>Multiplayer:<br/><br/>There is only one seat in Earl's truck, and with so many people buying for it, it is up to you to out collect your friends.<br/><br/>While this setup is designed to work much like single player mechanic wise. The cards are no longer discarded, but go back into the deck to provide nonstop fun. With only ten rounds, you need to collect all you can before your friends do. How can you do this? Simple, bet your friends during their turn to try to wrestle their cards away from them and into your personal pile.

It's great fun to play with any size group!<br/><br/>As an &quot;eyewitness,&quot; you'll watch newsreel clips from yesteryear - clips that are always interesting and often hilarious. Take good reporter's notes, because when each one-minute clip is over, you and your teammates must create questions about what you've just seen and heard: &quot; What number did you see on Babe Ruth's football jersey?,&quot; &quot;Did you catch the name of the canary who bicycled though Central Park?&quot;<br/><br/>Stump the opposing team, or answer their questions correctly, and your team moves ahead on the scoreboard. There are over 100 vintage clips in 15 different categories-from Hollywood to History-from Daredevils to Disasters-from Inventions to Industry. Each of the clips can be played again and again, because the players make up the questions.<br/><br/>So, dim the lights. Take a step back in time. Invite family and friends to see who's got the scoop when you play Eyewitness Newsreel Challenge!<br/><br/>",

Every objective has rewards for success or consequences for failure. The major objectives always reward success with &quot;Construct 1 City Site.&quot; But they are expensive and take collaboration. There are some cheaper objectives that offer this reward but more luck is needed.<br/><br/>Citizens have talents &amp; temptations as actions.

So gear up and get ready to capture the ugly creatures that have invaded the bathroom form underneath the toilet. Flush is a fast paced game where players race against the clock to get all their creatures into the toilet before it flushes and they get wet. Now you can play with the toilet water!<br/><br/>The first player starts the game by lifting the toilet lid, this will start the game and creatures will start popping out so you can capture them. Once the toilet starts to spin, scattering creatures everywhere, all players compete at the same time by attempting to capture the creatures of their headband color with the magnetic plunger--no hands allowed! Once you have shown your skill by capturing one of the creatures with the plunger attached to your headband you need to send the creature back into the toilet. Remove the creature from the plunger(now you can use your hands) and use the Flipper located on the game base that matches your headband color to flip the creature into the toilet. You need to work fast to get as many of your creatures into the toilet before the toilet flushes and sprays water into your face. Be brave and keep competing to capture the most creatures you can during the last 30 seconds of the game while the water is spraying. When the toilet stops spinning the game is over (approx. 3 minutes). This is the most fun you will ever have with a toilet. The player with the most of their colored creatures in the toilet will be the winner!<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Game base<br/>Water basin insert<br/>Smiling toilet timer<br/>4 2-piece magnetic headband plungers<br/>24 magnetic &quot;little creatures&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a distant relative of &quot;Survive!&quot; which introduces a number of interesting twists.<br/><br/>You are Noah's helpers and are competing to bring the best variety of animals on board before the waters rise too much.  The board and bits are very nice plastic, except for the animals which are cardboard (and whose bases tend to fray after a while).  There is a big Ark sitting in the middle of the board that acts as a four-slotted piggy bank.  A whole bunch of four-squares bases shaped like lightning bolts come in three colours and represent the cool (white), temperate (green) and hot (yellow) continents.  Each of these bases can hold an animal.  The bases and animals are deployed semi-randomly at the game outset by all players (this could need to be better constrained by the rules as the set-up has considerable consequences on the game's outcome); the restriction is that each continent must form a single land mass.  Although the bases come in three heights, this is ignored in the rules.<br/><br/>The animals are colour-coded at their bases to indicate on which continent they belong.  They all come in pairs.  Some animals are predators, with a red background.  You must deploy them so as to split the pairs.  Your little boat has room for two animals on board.  You cannot carry a predator and a prey at once, but all other combinations are OK.<br/><br/>You roll a six-sided die to move; on a one, a continent base sinks (is removed) instead; you do not move.  The flooded base cannot have an animal on it, so if there are no floodable bases, you reroll.  Otherwise, you must use the exact die roll to move with --diagonals aren't allowed.  Once beside a continent, the die roll is used to send an &quot;expedition&quot; to catch an animal, which again must be reached by exact count.  If the trail goes through another animal  as well, you have the option of capturing it too.  You go back to your two &quot;berth&quot; spaces beside the Ark to drop the animals off --this also gets you a free second move.<br/><br/>Once the last animal is removed from the land, the game ends instantly.  All animals in transit (on board players' boats) are discarded and those in the Ark are scored.  Prey are worth one, predators two.  A pair of animals doubles in worth.  If you have animals from each of the three continents, your score doubles.<br/><br/>As the Ark hides the animals dropped in its compartments, there is an element of memory involved --you should try to remember what each player has brought back so far to have an idea of who's in the lead.<br/><br/>The movement system is annoying because diagonals aren't allowed (so parity conservation is enforced) and actually makes the game drag a bit at the end; it'd suggest playing that exact rolls aren't required --or that diagonals are allowed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is essentially 3D Nine Men's Morris with dice.<br/><br/>The board consists of three stacked surfaces, each looking like a progressively smaller Morris board.  They are numbered from top to bottom.<br/><br/>The first play phase is placement.  The dice dictate where you can appear.  For example, a throw of one and two allows either one piece on board two, or two pieces on board one.  Placements are mandatory.  You may be forced to pass if no placement is possible.<br/><br/>Once all of your pieces are placed, you use the dice to move them (the transition turn may feature a placement and a move).  Here too the dice dictate the moves: a throw of one and two allows either one piece to move on board two, or two pieces on board one, or one piece from board two to board one (or vice-versa).  Moves are mandatory.<br/><br/>As in Morris, every time a three-piece alignment is formed (including vertical ones), this is a Mill and one opposing piece of the miller's choice is removed.  Pieces in mills are protected.  Multiple mills may be formed by a single move.  You win by grinding the opponent down to two pieces.<br/><br/>The four-player game is a partnership game.<br/><br/>",

Players are missing many kinds of building material, which has to be traded with the other house owners. Thus one exchanges a door for a heating or a plug socket for a tap. In that way the house is gradually finished. But the game takes a twist, as a player has to set a column in his house whenever he throws a six with the dice. With the fifth six one receives the ceiling plate of his house and continues to build on the first floor. Whenever one player has the first house finished (after the completion of the first floor) the game  ends, but the finishing player does not necessarily have to have won. For each complete room the players get points, and whoever has the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Bau auf! is set in the former GDR and gives a funny insight with which problems people had to cope in that time, when they wanted to build a house.<br/><br/>",

The counters have a combat and movement value with some of the troops having their combat number in parenthesis (the musket-armed troops I bet, but there does seen to be a lot of them). There is a neat time spiral in the middle of a roster page (what is recorded there, I have no idea), as the CRT is a &lsquo;push-style&rsquo; one, with the results of &lsquo;AD&rsquo;, &lsquo;AR&rsquo; &lsquo;Eng&rsquo;, &lsquo;DR&rsquo; and &lsquo;DD&rdquo;.

But they need your help to reach their dream: to rise to the Top of the Charts!<br/><br/>You can do that by landing on special spaces and scoring points!<br/><br/>Secret Dreams cards reveal the band's dreams. Then you get to select a dream of your choice. If your friends match you, everyone can score!<br/><br/>California Dreams cards can be good: score points when Tony buys new drums. Or not so good: When Tony loses both drum sticks, that's a BUMMER point.<br/><br/>Lucky Star cards can tell you that someone in the band thinks you're a great dancer! Guess who it is. (Is it Jake? Maybe Matt?) If the spinner matches your guess, you collect points for them and help them move closer to their dream!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There are 60 cards with ranks from 1 to 15, quantities ranging from two 1's up to six 15's; 15 of the cards are worth a point each.  All cards are dealt out.  The player receiving the 15 marked &quot;star-DAH&quot; begins by playing any number of 15's.  Each player in turn then either passes or plays the same amount of cards as the last set played, but with a lower rank.  When all but one players have passed, the last one to play takes all the cards played and starts a new trick with one or more cards of the same rank.  The round continues until all players are out of cards; then point cards taken are scored.  The first player to go out  begins the next round by getting the two best (i.e., lowest-numbered) cards from the last player to go out, giving any two in return; likewise, the second to go out gets the best card from the next-to-last to go out.  (With three players, the first and last to go out exchange one card.)  Play continues until one player reaches 50 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the hit BBC television program of the same name, 'It's a Knockout', versions of which ran concurrently in countries across Europe.  Contestants competed in silly obstacle course type games, usually wearing equally silly costumes.  Regional heats culminated in the winners representing their countries in international contests known as &quot;Jeux Sans Fronti&egrave;res&quot; (Games Without Frontiers).  The board game was originally created in Britain in 1974 and became the Australian Toy Association's game of the year in 1986.<br/><br/>Players move around a playing board until they land on one of the 'games' that include variants on tiddlywinks, target shooting, blow football and bowling. The position that players finish in the sub-games determines the amount of points that they receive.  Each player has a &quot;joker&quot; that can be played before any one game and they get double points for that game.<br/><br/>The player with the highest number of points wins.<br/><br/>The game is designed for children, but is enjoyable when played by adults that remember the television program.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This book of games is 30 pages long, and is a hardback.  The dimensions are 250mm (10&quot;) by 355mm (14&quot;).  There are fifteen separate boards, including a Chess / Checkers board in the front papers and a Backgammon board in the end papers<br/><br/>John Astrop has written a short introduction, outlining the games he has chosen for this book and categorizing them in four groups:<br/>Easy Race Games (for small kids)- Ludo, Fire! Fire! (Snakes and Ladders), Steeplechase and Dragon.<br/>Harder Race Games (for older games) - Palm Tree, Shunting, Jackpot and Space Race.<br/>Position Games (dependent on strategy alone)- Checkers, Chess, Nine Men's morris, Five Field Kono, Asalto <br/>Wargames (strategy, imagination and luck) - Chess, Spychase, Warlord and Backgammon.<br/><br/>Palm Tree is a combination of Ludo and Snakes and Ladders, with a nice art deco board.<br/><br/>Space Race, Shunting, Warlord, Spychase and Jackpot appear to be original games.  The others are either classic games or re-themed roll-and-move games.<br/><br/>Space Race is a bigger scale version of Ludo, requiring the players to roll the right numbers to build their rockets before starting on the trip to the Green Planet.  There are various squares on the way that give different results as you land on them.  The only strategy comes in deciding which piece to move.<br/><br/>In Shunting players again roll and move, but have to pick up four trucks before returning to the start.  Players have only one train each, and can only move in one direction in a turn, but can then change direction on the next direction, as if they were trains passing through points.  Trains block each other, although they do not get bigger with extra trucks on.<br/><br/>Warlord is a capture game with a pre-Raphaelite design.  Players have 4 pieces starting at castles on the corners on the board, and can move any one of these 4 in turn.  Landing exactly on an enemy piece captures it, and the captured piece can then be moved back to the castle and imprisoned.  Players can release captive pieces through the enchanted forest or lake.  A single piece can capture more than one enemy piece, but if that pile is recaptured, all friendly pieces go free.<br/><br/>Spychase is similar to Scotland Yard, with no hidden movement.  The spy player attempts to steal a set of plans by rolling and landing on them, then escaping to the airport or docks.  The police players cannot capture the spy until he has taken the plans.  At that point the police player then tries to block in the spy player so that he cannot move his full roll.<br/><br/>In Jackpot, the 2 players move their pieces up a fruit machine the full number rolled, but can only move a piece when the fruit under the piece moved is shown on the row of 6 fruit that the piece arrives on.  If no forward moves can be made, a piece must be moved down the dice roll instead.  Once all three pieces are at the final squares, a player wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NOTE: This game board is included in Brian Love's &quot;Play the Game&quot; (1978). While correctly presenting the theme of the game, Love simplified the rules considerably, removing much of the natural &quot;whirlpool&quot; action and reducing each player's pieces from two to one.<br/><br/>Whirlpool is a 2-4 player game from British games maker Chad Valley and functions as an inverted race game: the last player to reach the center (the Vortex) wins. Like Goose games and most other simple spiral race games, there is no strategy, only luck. However, it is fast-paced and fun, especially for kids.<br/><br/>Each player has two pieces of their color and must start them on the track on their first two turns. From then on, they must always move their rear-most piece. If a piece lands on another piece (of any color) they must move it forward an equivalent number of spaces to their roll, which can set off a huge chain reaction if one piece lands on another piece, which lands on another piece, etc. This simulates the &quot;pull&quot; of the whirlpool.<br/><br/>Four &quot;Reserve&quot; spots set just before the Vortex function as last-minute reprieves, with different actions depending on whether the Reserve matches your color or not. On leaving the Reserves, pieces are flung into the Vortex - a dramatic ending! When all others have been sucked into the Vortex, the remaining piece is the survivor and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

With this historic stroke of a pen, the stage was set for Union Pacific to open the American West to settlers and, in the process, connect a continent.  The transcontinental route heralded the Industrial Revolution and modernized transportation, turning the grueling, six-month, $1,000 journey from New York to San Francisco into a week long trip costing a mere $70.<br/><br/>It took an army of 20,000 men, working 12 to 16 hours a day, seven days a week, for six years, to connect America east to west by rail.  It was a remarkable feat, as the system was built primarily by hand.  With the driving of the Golden Spike on May 10, 1869, the route was complete, and a vast, largely unpopulated region was poised for growth.<br/><br/>Today, the 50,000 men and women of Union Pacific still connect America&rsquo;s communities, transporting the raw materials and finished goods that keep our economy, and our country, moving.<br/><br/>Tokens include: Railroad crossing signal; Engineer&rsquo;s cap, Golden Spike, Caboose, Locomotive, and a Lantern.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game intended to teach children about dogs. The rulebook has a general information section on dogs, including what meaning of different behavior in dogs, what an angry/scared dog looks like, and how to teach children about dogs. Sometimes, the rules instruct the players to act dog like (barking, rolling etc.)<br/><br/>The game includes a board with an imaginary village printed on it, 4 playing pieces (dogs) on plastic bases, a deck of cards which represent 24 breeds of dog - some of which are &quot;leaders&quot; - and one 6-sided die. All of the dogs belong to families living in the village, identified by the first letter of a dog's name.<br/><br/>The game is subdivided into 6 different variants:<br/><br/>Game #1: 2-4 players, 10-15 minutes. This is described as a &quot;warm-up&quot; game, the board is not used. Players are &quot;leader&quot; dogs trying to gather their own pack by drawing cards blindly. The player with the most dogs after all non-leader breeds have been drawn wins.<br/><br/>This game also has a solitaire variant.<br/><br/>Game #2: 2-4 players, 30 minutes. Again, the players represent leaders trying to gather a pack. This is accomplished by visiting the 4 houses in the village to pick up dogs, then take them to the dog park.<br/><br/>This game has rule variants to make it a bit more challenging.<br/><br/>Game #3: 2-4 players, 20-30 minutes. Again, the players represent leaders, but this time they already have a pack. The players must return the dogs in their pack to the families, then find a way to their own house.<br/><br/>Game #4: 3 or more players, 10-20 minutes. This time the players must co-operate to gather a pack and take it to the dog park, playing against time (die rolls).<br/><br/>This game also has a solitaire variant.<br/> Game #5: 2-4 players, 20-30 minutes. This is basically a version of the Game of Authors - players are trying to complete series of dogs belonging to the same family.<br/><br/>Game #6: Solitaire, variable playing time. The aim is to rescue dogs from the kennel by pairing up the kennel dogs with free dogs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules:<br/><br/>Infecta is the game of cell survival. A life-and-death struggle between single-celled organisms involves two players in a rapid action contest of dice and strategy. Each opponent attempts to inflict the foreign cell by exposing it to a carrier virus while defensively contracting its own cell wall and shifting its nucleus out of danger. As in life, fate is decided by aggression, instinct and luck.<br/><br/>Description:<br/><br/>In Infecta each player controls a cell made up of a nucleus piece and many cell wall pieces. Each player also controls six virions (virus particles) which can destroy other pieces; the object is to destroy the opponent's nucleus, all the opponent's virions, or all the opponent's cell walls.<br/><br/>On a turn the active player rolls two dice and moves pieces accordingly. Virions can only move in straight lines, and each one must use the full amount rolled on one die. The other pieces can split dice and move in any combination of directions desired. Rolling doubles entitles a player to another turn (though this cannot be repeated) and also to restore a destroyed virion under certain conditions.<br/><br/>",

The two to four players have to arrange a healthy food plan for one week, including three meals a day, snacks and drinks.<br/><br/>Each eatable item is represented by a card and has a point value and a fat value. The point value is good for the scoring, while the fat value is important for planing the daily dishes. Each day only allows 15 fat points in total for the meals, the snacks and the drinks.<br/><br/>To make the game more interesting you cannnot only play cards onto your own meal plan, you can put cards to the meals of your opponents, too.<br/><br/>After each day, the players get points based on there meal decisions and after one week the game is over.<br/><br/>",

The magnets of each team are polarised in reverse, so you cannot move your opponents players with your rod. The rod is used to drag your players across the board, thus allowing you to push the ball around.<br/><br/>The game board is a smooth hardboard surface, marked out with a football pitch, and a basic raised surround to stop the ball going out of play.<br/><br/>Magnetic football is excellent fun - a splendid ice breaker at parties and games evenings - and requires a surprising amount of skill. If you move the players too fast, or use too much power, then it is very easy to leave either the player or the ball behind! Although you cannot control your opponent's players, your reversed magnet can be used to flip them over.<br/><br/>",

The player to the left of the dealer begins by placing one card face down onto the centre of the table and names its picture, for example saying &quot;flower&quot;. The next player puts a card on top of it also saying &quot;flower&quot;, this is when the bluffing comes in. Each player in his turn has to claim to lay the same picture as that which was started with whether he has one or not. Play continues in this way until the call comes back to the player who started the round. He calls again the name of the picture he started with and lays a card. This is the end of that round. The next player starts a new round by placing a card on top of the cards already on the table (if any) and names the same or a different picture.<br/>Any time a player thinks another player is bluffing he may challenge him. If he is in fact bluffing and has not laid the card he said, he has to pick up all the cards on the table and add them to his hand.

Vaccarino or Rio Grande Games.<br/><br/>Victory over your neighbors has always been kind of a big deal for you, but just when you thought building yourself the single most impressive empire in the land was all you had to worry about, the stakes went and got higher. Your victory points are now tied to your very life! It all started with that foul-cursed gold. In the future, you will never trust anything given to you by a man in a village who won't stop spinning when you try to look at him. Of course, now you have access to incredible power, but each time you use it, you bring yourself closer to your own demise. With great power comes great responsibility &mdash; or something like that.<br/><br/>Fortunately, you aren't alone in your fight. A ragtag band of mercenaries has arrived in the kingdom to save the day &mdash; or rather to fight for whoever has the coin. Your mercenaries can wreak havoc on your opponents, but if a stronger warrior takes them by surprise, the resulting curses find their way back to you. This war has turned you into a gambling man (or woman, as the case may be). How much of your own life will you risk to bring down your opponents? Oh, and remember to get your shots.<br/><br/>For Duel, players need the Treasure cards, Victory cards, Curse cards, and Trash card from Dominion or Dominion: Base Cards to play. As with other Dominion games, players must choose ten sets of Kingdom cards for each game.<br/><br/>Duel introduces several new &quot;Curse&quot; cards to the game of Dominion, the generation of a more advanced &quot;Curse Deck&quot;, and a new token: the &quot;curse token&quot;. It also introduces a &quot;life points&quot; system adding another win-condition to the game; in games with this condition, curse tokens modify a player's &quot;Life Points&quot; total. (If the &quot;Life Points&quot; win condition isn't used, whenever a card requires a player to gain +Y (curse tokens), that player must take one curse token for each curse token specified by the number &quot;Y&quot;. Each curse token is worth -1 VP.)<br/><br/>Duel also introduces a new &quot;Attack/Action/Reaction&quot; card type, the &quot;Warrior Cards&quot;. The strength of each Warrior Card is represented by a number within a shield symbol for each Warrior Card. The strengths of each Warrior Card range from 1-10, with 1 being the lowest strength and 10 being the highest strength. When a Warrior Card is played as an Action, the player playing the card first resolves the actions printed on the card in order from top to bottom (e.g. &ldquo;Gain a Silver&rdquo; for the Silver Knight; &ldquo;+1 Card then +1 Action for the Warrior Angel). After unique actions have been resolved, resolve the &ldquo;Each other player gains a Curse&rdquo; effect common to all Warrior Cards. This effect causes each player to draw a card from the Curse Deck or play a Reaction card in response.  These Warrior Cards can also be played as a Reaction card to another player playing a Warrior Card as an Attack card; In this case, the two Warrior Cards &quot;Duel&quot; eachother, and the one with the highest power wins the battle (and unique results are followed as indicated on the cards and within the rules).<br/><br/>",

Pieces are captured by hopping over them, and the board is composed of two triangle grids.<br/><br/>It is the same game as Butterfly (game) from Mozambique, which suggests a historical connection between the two games.<br/><br/>Lau kata kati belongs to a specific category of games called Indian War-games, and the other games in this category are Dash-guti, Egara-guti, Pretwa, Gol-skuish. All Indian War-games have one important thing in common, and that is that all the pieces are laid out on the grid patterned board, with only one vacant point in the center. This forces the first move to be played on the central point, and captured by the other player's piece.<br/><br/>To capture all of the opponent's pieces, or be the one with more pieces when no more pieces can be taken by either player, or stalemate the other opponent's pieces such that they are immobilized.<br/><br/>It is important to realize that Lau kata kati's board is the basis of other games, in particular, Dash-guti and Egara-guti. In serves as a basis for other games in the same way that the Alquerque board and the draughts board is a basis for other games.<br/><br/>",

They plant according to the garden calendar and promote the growth of their plants. However, a lot has to be taken into account. Are they low or flat rooted, weak, medium or heavy consuming? Does the plant have a long or short growth period? In addition, weather caprioles, beneficial insects and pests, the neighbor or other imponderables can influence the tranquil gardener life.<br/>Game objective: The players try to &quot;harvest&quot; as many self-planted as also by other players placed plant cards.

Players travel a twisty maze of paths to visit the many absurd and memorable locations they saw in that one movie, all while avoiding the Black Knight who stalks the Players across the board. Each location has its own unique purpose that will bring the Players one step closer to earning the Valor points they need to find the Holy Grail first, but your fellow Knights won&rsquo;t make it easy when they band together to hurl insults and sabotage your Quest. And just when you think you&rsquo;ve got it all figured out, another Player catapults a cow at you and you&rsquo;re suddenly left reevaluating your life choices. Everyone&rsquo;s a &ldquo;frenemy&rdquo; in this official play-at-home adaptation of the cult classic movie the New York Times once called &ldquo;a marvelously particular kind of lunatic endeavor&rdquo;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They're hardworking and dedicated, but their tendency for messiness and love for food fights can make things challenging. Despite these quirks, they have hearts brimming with kindness and a wickedly delightful sense of humour. When it comes to hide-and-seek, their version is absolutely hilarious and bound to leave you in stitches.<br/><br/>Snow White and the Eleven Dwarfs is a game for 7 to 18 players, and is perfect for parties and family gatherings. It is a team deduction game, with Snow White on one side, and the Dwarfs on the other. Dwarf identities are secret, and Snow White needs to find the Dwarf named Happy. The Dwarfs work together to figure out who among them has overslept and is late for work.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The only hope for the Planetary Systems under his domain lays in their representatives, who must cross the Maze by their own means, against the full power of Dracos&quot;<br/><br/>This is a light maze/exploration game played on a 22x26 grid where 1-4 players assuming the roles of each of the Planetary Systems emissaries try to take their ships from one edge of the labyrinth (the board) to the opposing edge. The &quot;walls&quot; (or energy screens)that the labyrinth is made of are secretly deployed on a control sheet by the Dracos player, and are not visible at the beginning on the board.<br/><br/>The emissaries and Dracos take turns moving their ships, the emissaries trying  to find a path to reach the edge of the board or in the case of Dracos, trying to destroy the ships of the emissaries.<br/><br/>During their movement, the emissaries can use several tools to avoid the dangers, such as scanners, lasers and shields, and in addition can cooperate exchanging these tools. Dracos has its own ships and the labyrinth itself to stop and destroy the other players.<br/><br/>Each player that reaches the goal square scores a marginal victory, while a total victory can only be achieved if ALL emissaries reach the goal, so cooperation is encouraged.<br/><br/>",

To capture a villain such as the Lizard requires one Spiderman icon. To capture Galactus requires one each of Captain America, Hulk and Spiderman. Players may reroll &quot;misses&quot; but once an &quot;X&quot; is rolled, that die cannot be rerolled so there is a slight press-your-luck element.<br/><br/>There are some wild cards that give players an icon of their choice. Some other special cards give players extra rerolls or force a player to give up one of their previously captured villains.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who has captured the most villains when the deck runs out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Discovery Game is designed to be played by a married couple. It creates an atmosphere of exhilaration, where a couple can experience something similar to those initial &quot;falling in love&quot; feelings. During this process, true intimacy is developed and deepened. That being said, the game is also competitive; the couple competes one against the other as they both enjoy the benefits of their new-found intimacy. It is simply a great date night in a box&mdash; accessible anytime and anywhere&mdash; no costs, no distractions, no preparations, no planning.<br/><br/>The Discovery Game is effective for the newlywed, the empty-nester, for couples that are very close and those who are struggling. This is possible because the couple controls the content and the pace of intimacy. The discovery game simply provides the environment and the parameters necessary for a great date to take place. Consequently, the game provides the perfect environment for a connected couple seeking an exciting night of physical intimacy, while also providing the perfect environment for a couple hoping to re-establish friendly lines of communication.<br/><br/>The game is a Focus on the Family &quot;Reviewed&quot; product. It has also received endorsements from FamilyLife, The American Association of Christian Counselors and Shaunti Feldhahn (the best-selling author of &quot;For Men Only and For Women Only&quot;).<br/><br/>In that there are property spaces one may purchase, and because the Reality Check spaces often impart financial setbacks similar to those encountered in real life, The discovery Game is sometimes said to be similar to Monopoly and the Game of Life. The discover Game is different from those games in that it was designed to generate intimacy in a relationship. To that end, the discovery spaces are among the most important spaces on the board. For when a player lands on a discovery space he or she draws a discovery card. The cards prompt the player to several types of actions&mdash; all of which promote intimacy. The discovery Game is also unlike many adult board games which are purposed on inducing sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse is often the outcome for many couples as they play, and The discovery Game does encourage mild physical intimacy and hugs, it is never coercive. Sexual intimacy that is spawned by The discovery Game is always the free choice of the players&mdash; as a couple&mdash; and the natural result of emotional intimacy.<br/><br/>Spaces unique to the game are:<br/><br/>     The &quot;Wish Space&quot; (when a player lands on this space, using the included sand-timer, he or she must perform the wishes of his or her partner for two minutes. These wishes might be sexual in nature, but they might also involve household chores&mdash; It is always up to the players and the actions must be mutually consensual).<br/>     The &ldquo;Center Square&rdquo; (is a jackpot where monies from the players are directed at various points in the game. If a player enters the Center Square and rolls doubles, he or she acquires all of the money in the jackpot. If a player cannot roll doubles he or she can use his or her &ldquo;Get Out of Center&rdquo; card. If he or she has already used that card, the player may exit the Center Square by removing an article of clothing (socks, shoes, shirt, it is the players choice). A player can enter and exit this space from any Reality Check or discovery space on the board, and the Reality Check and discovery spaces are located all around the board. This makes the Center Square an extremely helpful way of navigating the board.<br/><br/><br/>One of the greatest things about The Discovery Game is, no one feels like they are working on their marriage! It's just fun! This is a tool that has been used by thousands of strong and struggling marriages alike, to move them toward passion. It normally takes at least an hour to complete. However, because much of the game is dependent on the discussions which ensue from the discovery cards, the discussions themselves determine the time it takes to play the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fairy Tale Assassin League is a story telling card game. It asks the question: &ldquo;What happens when Snow White goes to Las Vegas and turns bad?&rdquo;  There are no more happy ever afters.<br/><br/>The game starts with players choosing a fairy tale character; one will be the villain, the remainder good.  Each characters starts in one of six locations (restaurant, parking lot, theater, stage, kitchen and back alley).  The first act of the game is to come up with reasons why the bad guy has to go down. The bad guy starts by bragging about how bad they are. The heroes then say how they have been personally hurt by him.  Players can jump in with suggestions for other people&rsquo;s stories.<br/><br/>The rest of the game is about bringing the villain down (and maybe to justice).  The bad guy starts the game. Players take turns to add to the story, assisted by a tableau of scene cards (representing some key point in a revenge story plot) and action cards that can be played from hand. Another player&rsquo;s version of events can be challenged by playing an action card.  Challenges are resolved by rolling dice, with the winner winning the card their opponent used.  All cards are worth victory points.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to score the most victory points while also telling an interesting story.<br/><br/>The publisher intends to produce two 54 card decks. One will be titled Red Riding Hood Rampage and the other Snow White? Not Anymore.  The two decks can be combined to make a larger scale game.<br/><br/>",

There are no roads needed to place the settlements, but you have to pay for them by using resources collected from a die roll that corresponds to a number on the area. Because the grid is used, the players place settlements on the cross of 4 corners, and have access to all of the resources touching it. The main goal of the game is to build your settlements, advance them from branches to wards to stakes (settlement to city) so that you can collect more resources (1,2 or 3). Then along the way the final goal is to pay for certain cards with resources and money(gold resource). After all the cards have been collected by the players the one with the most of these special cards (3 different kinds) wins. Along the way there are special cards that allow for the &quot;robber&quot; (every player rolls on the end of their turn to see if they are robbed [on doubles of the dice]) to not influence you, the black crickets card to unaffect you via the seagulls card, missionary cards, divine inspiration cards, paying tithing bonuses, etc. The components need some help, being that it does look like a first production. Thicker cardboard than normal games might have. Instead of a deck of cards, they come in a sheet you have to pull apart. For a first try it wasn't bad, except the trench (folded area of board), which makes placement on that area annoying.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sea Battle is a card game played in a manner similar to Battleship. The components are 89 water cards with identical fronts and backs and 32 ships cards whose backs are the same as the water cards. The game is packaged in a nice hard clear plastic box that is divided into 3 compartments to hold the cards and rules. A full color cardboard slip case shows three ships in battle on the front and a brief description. illustration of a grid layout, component list and the name Altenburg-Stralsunder Spielgarten AG.<br/><br/>On the side of the slip case is printed: Altenburg-Stralsunder Spielgarten AG Leinfelden bei Stuttgart and SEA BATTLE a GAME BY ACE. The logo is the word ACE over a red heart inside the letter V and inside a circle.<br/><br/>According to the very brief and somewhat vague rules, &quot;Each player selects 20 or more water cards and 8 ships cards...&quot; There are 3 colors of ships. The cards are laid out in a grid all face down. 3 Red ships are independent and may be placed face down anywhere in the grid, Brown ships are part of a small fleet and must be placed adjacent to one other Brown ship orthogonally and Yellow ships form a large fleet and must be placed adjacent to 2 other Yellow ships orthogonally or diagonally.<br/><br/>The very brief rules refer to a players ability to move or exchange ships during the turn but give no specifics on when and how. Also not given are any specifics regarding more than two players. Players alternate calling out grid locations and revealing cards. A hit entitles the player to another shot. A player wins when he has sunk all the opponents ships. (Pix will follow).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1950s French-Canadian game is a form of bingo or lotto but played with a regular deck of cards. The game consists of a roll of red tokens and a set of 12 player boards, each showing 25 different cards in a five-by-five grid. Unlike bingo, there is no free center space on a board, nor are card values restricted to any given row or column.<br/><br/>The dealer or caller shuffles the card deck and turns over the top cards one at a time. Each player with that card showing on their board covers it with a red token.

That was then but now it's time to play crosswords The Dummies Way.<br/><br/>In this game you begin with 10 word strips and 100 points. Each word strip has a word from 3-7 letters.  On one side the word is written from left to right, on the other it is written from top to bottom.  Players take turns playing their words crossword fashion on a board.  There are bonuses that allow the players to &quot;go again&quot; or &quot;give a word&quot; to another player. The object is to get rid of all of your words first. Other players then lose points for the words they have left.<br/><br/>Rounds are played until someone gets to zero and then highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Players select the cards from six categories, which are tailored for children, and from the easiest (and lowest value) first.  If they buzz in earliest and answer correctly, they receive the chips from that spot and the next higher value question becomes available.  The game also has a Chance (Daily Double), in which the player wins double his wager if he correctly replies in the form of a question.<br/><br/>When all cards on the board have been attempted, the Final Jeopardy round begins.  All players wager on and attempt to answer the Quizmaster's question.  The Jeopardy Grandmaster is the player with the highest total value of chips at the end.<br/><br/>",

They start from their space stations and and travel through the stars following the number obtained on the dice (from 2 to 6). Additionally, a space shuttle travels into the galaxy and it is moved every time the dice shows its figure (corresponding to number 1). When a player lands on a star containing a chip he must turn it out: if the chip shows a super-crystal the player take it. The players should bring as many crystals as possible back to their space stations before the space shuttle reach the galaxy. However, the chip can show no crystal but a monster, a crystal-breaker. In this case, the astronaut rolls the dice to fight against the monster, which power corresponds to the number of its teeth. If the player wins, he captures the crystal-breaker and can bring it to his station as his prisoner. If the monster wins, all crystals owned by the player and still not safe in his station are put on this field and become property of the monster. These crystals can be recovered by a player who defeat the monster in another battle. The game ends when the spaceship arrives at the galaxy and the winner is the player who has the majority of the points given by the values of crystals and the amount of monster teeth he has brought to his start station.<br/><br/>",

Unique features include replayable investigations and crime prevention. 1-4 players choose heroes and dive into a cyberpunk world to investigate crimes then travel to the past and prevent them.<br/><br/>Resolvers: Time to Shift is a cooperative game. During their turn, a player selects a desired action for their character from the list provided by the app and follows the instructions on the screen, such as moving player/npc pieces, opening new location tiles, performing skill checks, adding equipment cards e.t.c. Each player action takes time, which is tracked by the app and used to select an active player. The app also keeps all the information gathered by the players during their investigations. When players think they have accumulated enough knowledge, they can jump back in time to prevent a crime. Successfully preventing a crime opens the next campaign mission.<br/><br/>Replayability is delivered by an app generating detective stories. The app explains rules, tracks time and saves players progress.<br/><br/>",

The game comes with a rulebook in four languages:  Danish, German, English and Italian.  Game components include seven different teams with seven cyclist pieces of each, one team leader, two climbers, two tempo-riders and two sprinters each, plus special pieces for the yellow, green, polka-dot and World Champion jerseys.  The game comes with modular pieces that allow the player to design any course and comes with instructions for major cycling races like the Liege-Bastogne-Liege and Paris-Roubaix classics, the 2009 Tour de France, and the 2009 World Championship.  Movement of the cyclists is controlled by die rolls and play of tactical cards.<br/><br/>From the advertising on the game box:<br/><br/>&quot;World Cycling Game is a fun and intense game for the whole family.  In World Cycling Game you need to see the big picture and have patience as the game is not won by luck but by the right tactic.<br/><br/>You set your team with your own favourites and use your tactical cards wisely.  In World Cycling Game you battle against your friends for the yellow and polka dot jersey or the World Championship and the rainbow colored jersey.  You'll find the greatest and historical races in this game or you can build thousands of different routes yourself with long mountains and dangerous downhill passages.  World Cycling Game is a very varied and always exciting game and you can play it over and over.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Both start opposite of each other in the middle of a 4 by 8 &quot;river&quot; board. The boat player secretly chooses one card (printed with the values 1 to 4) to select the column on the board he wishes to move to. The crocodile player has to guess this column and place his crocodiles on two spaces to block the boat. If the crocodile player was right, the boat has to retreat one row into the direction of &quot;its&quot; river bank, if the other player succeeded in choosing a crocodile-free space, he moves one step to the river bank of the other player.<br/>Whoever reaches the opposite bank first is the winner.<br/>No tactics involved, just blind guessing.<br/><br/>Was available as a big box with nicely designed components first, later followed by a small version (1988) with tiny pieces and (flimsy) cardboard river (with lots of air in the box).<br/><br/>",

During the first round, players acquire spare body parts (arms, legs, torsos and heads) from the black market and construct creatures in their operating theaters. As each player collects mutated limbs and tries to assemble them, their opponent attempts to steal parts, sabotage the supplies, and generally dismantle the opposing creation. Round two pits the creatures against one another, as their owners play attack and defend cards to bolster their monstrosity's fighting abilities. It's a fast-paced, gruesome, and strategic battle game best suited for two players (although up to four can play).<br/><br/>",

If the dog or shepherd is moved into a space next to a sheep then that sheep has to move on its next turn - no sheep may occupy a hexagon next to either the shepherd or his dog, unless it is unable to move.<br/><br/>The Shepherd and his Dog win the game if they succeed in herding all five sheep into the penned off area, behind the fence, and the fence is closed.

Each player has a hand of cards taken from corresponding Mordor and Fellowship decks. The board shows tracks to record the progress of pieces representing The Army of Mordor, Merry and the Rohirrim, Gandalf and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli, and Frodo and Sam. Along the board tracks are seven locations to represent the key conflicts of the movie : Minas Tirith, Osgiliath, Shelob's Lair, etc.<br/><br/>Each player takes a turn to roll dice, accumulating movement points which will allow them to draw a Journey card (again from corresponding Mordor and Fellowship decks), this card then instructing them to draw battle cards, or sometimes to force the opposing side to discard cards. Players must manage their hand of cards bearing in mind the different cards that 'trump' in the conflicts to come.<br/><br/>As each of the locations is reached by the piece moving there, different rules apply to determine the exact course of combat. The goal of the Fellowship is to survive these encounters long enough until Frodo and Sam reach Mount Doom : Mordor has the opportunity to bring an early victory by defeating the Fellowship before the Ring is cast into the fire.<br/><br/>Though this may have a cover similar to The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, this was accepted to the database on the premise that it is an entirely different game.<br/><br/>",

Some of the spaces have dino footprints on them. If you land on one, you roll the die a second time and move the T-Rex that many squares, either to get him out of your way, in someone else's or, better still, to frighten an opponent's dino back!

Humanity's last hope is to escape to space stations, in which there ain't enough room for everybody.<br/><br/>Players represent different nations with different leaders, all having different powers. Their goal is to build a working rocket and launch it to space before everybody else. The requirements for the working rocket change every game, and are only partially known to players. The rockets have four different aspects  which can be build to higher levels, highest one being level 3.<br/><br/>Each turn is separated to phases which happen simultaneously to all players. First there's production in which each player produces whats printed in their country-sheet, plus any specials they might have earned throughout the game. After production comes building/trading, players can only build one part of the rocker per turn but can freely trade anything (knowledge, materials etc).<br/><br/>After producing and building players draw one card from the event deck. Some of the events help players, some don't. Some give them more time to build, and some bring doomsday clock closer to midnight.<br/><br/>Game ends when event-deck runs out, or when somebody decides to launch his rocket and the launch is succesful (meets all the requirements).<br/><br/>The basis and rules for this game were created in a 25-hour happening organized by Helsinki city library in 14.-15.3.2014. The game will be available mostly through libraries in Finland, but currently there are no plans to repringt it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User summary<br/>Endless Working is the English title of 今日も帰れない (Kyou mo Kaerenai), a card game released during the Tokyo Game Market 2016 Spring (ゲームマーケット2016春) in  Odaiba, Tokyo, Japan.<br/><br/>It is the 4th game by the group MR Entertainment (MR エンターテイメント).<br/><br/>The title can be translated to&quot; 'Today I won't be coming back home either'. It is a name nicely fitting the context of the game.<br/><br/>The game is set in a fictional &quot;black company&quot; called CHI-KU. Each player is an employee at this company and has to work hard and do many hours of overtime work every day. The players are trusted 'slave workers' all affected to a new project called 'Endless Working'. They are expected to work super hard to make it a big success!<br/><br/>The game got popular thanks to its theme, which is a real and well-known problem in Japan.<br/><br/>In Endless working, the players take turn in drawing cards from the deck. There are 3 kinds of cards: TASK, STOP and END.<br/>The player who can collect the most TASK cards wins the game.<br/>You start by drawing as many cards as you want, one by one. When you stop drawing you have to carry out the action on the last card you drew.<br/><br/>TASK cards are 'safe' but change the state of your hand.<br/>STOP causes your turn to end right away and is a penalty for you or all players.<br/>END cards either ends the whole game immediately, or forces the rest of the game players to draw more cards before they can chicken out.<br/><br/>To put the players in the right atmosphere for the game, they recommend the players to say '進捗をすすめます！' (Let's make progress!) before drawing a new card and '帰ります！' (I'm going back home!) when they want to stop drawing cards.<br/><br/>",

Players are divided into 2-4 teams and roll a special die each turn to determine which game they will play. These games include Counterfactuals, Fun with Flags, Sketch Charades, and Celebrity.<br/><br/>In Counterfactuals, a member of the opposite team will draw a card that suppose a world that is different from our own in one key aspect, and asks a question about that world.  The competing teammates must choose from multiple-choice answers, and gain points if their answers match each other's, as well as if they match the game writers' answer.<br/><br/>The goal in Fun with Flags is for a player to guess flags from a deck of cards based on clues given by a teammate.  The twist is that there are 3 Oops Words that the Clue-Giver cannot say.<br/><br/>Sketch Charades is a simple drawing game, where one teammate will draw a card with a phrase, then has to draw it for another teammate to guess.<br/><br/>Finally, Celebrity is a charades game, in which one teammate is chosen to be the Actor and all the other teammates are the Guessers.  An opposing team chooses answers for each of 5 categories for the Actor to act out.<br/><br/>",

The blockade tiles are shuffled face down and ships are put into their holders, set up and placed at a minimum of one box length distance from the board.<br/><br/>In your turn you first turn over one blockade tile; the number on the tile determines the number of ships participating in the current blockade. One of your fellow players places this number of ships on spots of the board, in any orientation and position he likes; one of the ships must always be the Droid Control Ship. Then you as the active player take the five star chips and try to topple all ships by throwing chips at them, with a maximum of five throws. If you manage to topple all with less than five throws your turn ends with the last toppled ship. If you toppled the Droid Control Ship you score two points and you score one point for each other ship you toppled; one extra point is scored for each star chip you have left over. You move your Jedi Sternj&auml;ger forward accordingly along the box edge. If your Sternj&auml;ger reaches a score of 20 you win at the end of this round if you have most points. In a variant you must topple the Droid Ship with a certain kind of chip and score penalty points for ships you did not topple; in another version there are no given spots for the ships, you can put them anywhere.<br/><br/>",

Each player is dealt a hand of 3 cards that comes from a deck of cards where each card is unique, and has either has some information pertaining to the mystery, or has actions that a player can take. Each turn a player plays a card (reveals evidence) to the discard pile where everyone can read the information. The cards a player keeps in his hand are considered 'withheld evidence'. A player may also play a subpoena card to look at all the cards in a given players hand or to increase their own hand size. Play continues like this until a player thinks they can solve the mystery. They announce their solution (Who, Motive, How) and then reads (silently) the solution. If correct, they win, if not, they are out of the game and play continues.<br/><br/>Game is (very slightly) compared to the 'How to Host Your Own Murder' series, in that once the game is played, it cannot be played again by the same players, as there is only one solution.<br/><br/>The box even references said product, by stating that to play 'Dealing with Murder', you don't need to cook a dinner or show up wearing a costume to play.<br/><br/>",

Their collective challenge is to navigate a timeline, generated from the timeline deck, and to cooperate to defeat the dangers and vexations it throws in their paths.<br/><br/>On their ape-pursuit, the players will find a deck of items to assist and amuse them, and will be plagued by the problems that emerge from the malfunction deck.  Once the final card of the timeline has been revealed and overcome, the players are victorious, but if just one of the many Professors runs out of health before the quest is complete, the whole team loses - that&rsquo;s just how parallel timelines work, apparently.<br/><br/>A charming game of trousers, butlers and alternate realities inspired by the steampunk chap-hop concept album of the same name by Professor Elemental, renowned scientist, exotic dancer and explorer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is based on the eponymous character created by writer and illustrator Holly Hobbie.<br/><br/>In the game, players try to guess their opponents secret wishes as they move around the board. Each player starts the game with two wishes. On their turn, players roll a die and move the corresponding number of spaces. They must then follow the directions for the space on which the marker lands. On spaces, players may ask questions, go to the well, collect pennies from other players, give pennies to other players or exchange wishes. When asking questions, players can ask whether another player has a wish of a given color, one of two wishes of a given color or a specific wish of a given color. Players may ask questions by paying pennies (free on some spaces) as long as they receive &quot;Yes&quot; for an answer. When a player guesses correctly, he can pick up from the wishing well the number of pennies rolled on a die. Players whose wishes are guessed lose these wishes but have the opportunity of buying more of them until all wishes have been used up.<br/><br/>The last player to hold a secret wish wins.<br/><br/>From the box<br/>Join Holly and your friends as you try to guess the secret wishes that are held by the other players.  You'll move around the wishing well, pay a penny and ask a player about a wish.  Every time you guess a wish you can try to empty the well.  Pay close attention and remember what everybody says because the player with the last secret wish is the player who wins the game.<br/><br/>",

To move back there, a player must choose the correct potion while on the inner track.<br/><br/>A player MUST move into the start space and end the game if he has all of his photos.<br/><br/>Players then score their photos. Each player sums up the values of their photos. If a player has multiple photos of a place, only the best one counts.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>",

There are also arrows that let players remove tiles from play. This has two effects: it makes the circuit shorter as players skip over removed tiles and it can also remove a pawn from play, trapping a player until she can return the tile in play.<br/><br/>",

The title means &quot;People's Board Pastime&quot;.<br/><br/>Players in turn move their pawns by a number of spaces rolled on a single 6-sided die, and follow the instructions printed on the space on which they land.  Most of the spaces have players drawing cards and answering questions in one of four categories; correct answers are rewarded with game banknotes (representing Polish money from before the redenomination in 1990s).<br/><br/>Other spaces may provide players with money or trigger an auction of scarce commodities (represented by tokens).  When an auction is triggered by a player drawing a card or landing on a certain space, everyone, starting with the player on whose turn the auction occurred, gets to bid for the commodity, to increase their previous bid, or to pass.  Whoever offers the most gets the auctioned item.<br/><br/>The game ends when all 25 scarce commodity tokens are sold out.  The player who has the most of them is the winner.  In case of a tie, the victory goes to the richest tied player.<br/><br/>Game can be expanded by an official mobile app with extra questions and digital accessories, available for Android and iOS.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Relate is a 2-player game where the goal is to move one's blocks from his or her starting space to the starting spaces of the opponent.  A player does so by pushing the block into an orthogonally adjacent space, which will force the block to rotate to a new face.  This typically changes the color showing on the top of the cube, although the blue and orange faces are repeated.  The key to the game is that a player cannot move their own pieces so that both cubes show the same color, and if a player moves a piece so that the color on it matches the color of an opponent's block, the opponent must then move the block with the matching color.  The first player go get both blocks to the opponent's starting spaces wins.<br/><br/>Each block has two blue, two orange, one red and one yellow side.<br/><br/>",

During the game players take turns to play cards on the table (while keeping some cards to achieve their secret agendas); the cards played on the table help in meeting the requirements, but as more cards are on the table there are more probabilities of problems arising in the common research (at the end of each turn a number of dice is rolled depending on the number of cards on the table, and the result of the dice roll sometimes forces to remove some cards). After 10 turns, players win if they have reached the requirements, and one of the players will be the top winner if he/she has also reached his/her secret agenda. If the players have not reached the requirements, they collectively lose.<br/><br/>Inventum is a game of collaboration that highlights the role universites play in transferring knowledge to the community at large and hereby contributing to our economic and social well-being.<br/><br/>The game is published with the support of the University of Barcelona and the Fundaci&oacute; Bosch i Gimpera, from an original proposal by Marga Becerra and Mariona Ferrer.<br/><br/>",

Play then proceeds clockwise.<br/>&bull; A player&rsquo;s turn must always be taken in this order (during which steps 1 &ndash; 4 may repeat several times):<br/>1. Turn over a card. The cards show what dice must be rolled in step 3.<br/>2. Put down a chip. Then the player decides &mdash; based on the card and the intended dice roll &mdash; which chip he would prefer to put down. You can only put down one chip per card (one 10-point chip, one 50-point chip or one 100-point chip). Place it in the middle of the table next to the exposed card.<br/>3. Bet and roll the dice. Now the player must predict the total roll of the respective dice on the card when compared with the numbers currently showing on the dice.<br/>4. Evaluate the roll. The player&rsquo;s bet will be right or wrong. Right bets mean two possibilities for this player:<br/>&bull; He/she may take another turn, going through steps 1 &ndash; 4 again.<br/>&bull; Or he/she may end his/her turn. He/she takes all the upturned cards from the middle of the table, puts them in a stack in front of him/her and puts the chips from the middle of the table on the stack.<br/><br/>The game ends when only one player has chips left. This player gets one final turn. If he/she bets wrong, the chips are left in the middle of the table; nobody can use them in the scoring. The same goes for chips that were not yet used in betting.<br/><br/>The game also ends if no more cards can be drawn. In this case chips not yet used in betting do not score, either.<br/><br/>Scoring and winning<br/>Each player scores his/her stacks separately, by multiplying the number of cards in the stack by the total value of the chips in the stack. Then add the separate stack scores together for a grand total. The winner is the player with the highest grand total. In case of a tie, the player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "WILD ANIMALOPOLY has all the fun of a traditional real estate trading game with some wild animal twists. Instead of buying property, players become Caretakers of animals. Instead of rent, players pay Meal Fees. A player collects 4 Elements - the land, water, food and clean air that all animals need to survive and trades them in for a Habitat where an animal can survive on its own. Flip over the Animal Certificates and you'll find several fun facts about each animal. Did you know a polar bear has coal-black skin? Or that a flamingo is pink because it eats shrimp? How about the fact that a giraffe hoof is the size of a large dinner plate? It's all fun and games until you land on HIDE FROM PREDATOR... then it's time to run to HIDING and you're out for 3 turns! So grab your token and advance to EXPLORE. Who knows? You may become the caretaker of a two ton rhino. Or you might get fleas! Whatever Happens... It's howling good fun! IT'S WILD!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SETTING UP THE GAME<br/>Plan to play this game with someone you love (or would like to).<br/>The following is suggested before starting the game:<br/><br/>     Soft lighting: but not so soft that you can't read the Word Dice.<br/>     Music: whatever you turn on, or turns you on.<br/>     Drinks: BYO (or take from your host's fridge).<br/><br/><br/>When the mood is all set, place all 28 Word Dice on the table. Use the lower half of the cylindrical package as your Dice Cup. Grab a piece of paper and a pen for scoring (not included).<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME<br/>The object of the game is to use as many of the 28 Word Dice as possible in the three minutes allotted to form logically correct sentences. All sentences must intersect at one or more points.<br/>Correct: They desire her lips<br/>Incorrect: They lips her desire<br/>The player or team with the highest score at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>PLAYING THE GAME<br/><br/>     Any number of consenting adults may play. Create two or more equal teams of players. If there are only two players, you can just play with yourself.<br/>     It doesn't make a damn bit of difference who goes first, so to start, the first team places all 28 Word Dice in the Dice Cup. The bottom half of the package is used as the Dice Cup. Shake the Dice Cup thoroughly, and roll all the Word Dice onto the playing surface.<br/>     Invert the timer immediately and begin forming sentences with words on the top side of the Word Dice. Play stops when the timer runs out (after approximately three minutes). IMPORTANT! Any blank Dice rolled may be used as any word the<br/><br/><br/>players desire. It should be noted, however, that blank Dice have no point value when calculating the point total.<br/><br/>     Any noun may be made plural. Example: Man to Men or Woman to Women<br/>     Any verb may have an -S, -ING, -LY, or -ED added to suit the sense of the particular sentence it is used in. Example:<br/><br/><br/> I SPANK SHE SPANKS YOU ARE SPANKING WE SPANKED<br/> (Note: the ending of -PERY may also be added to the verb SLIP, making it the adjective SLIPPERY.)<br/><br/>     You may use any punctuation you like! This is one time where you don't need to panic if you have a missing period.<br/><br/><br/>SCORING<br/><br/>     Five points are scored for each Word Die used at the end of the three minutes.<br/>     Deduct three points for each Word Die not used.<br/>     Any Word Die used in two sentences is given a double value&ndash;<br/><br/><br/>10 points!<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME<br/>The suggested game length is three rounds...if you can last that long. The person or team with the highest score at the end of the game is declared the winner, and presented with an M.D.W. (Master of Dirty Words).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In the board game World of Tanks: Winners,  each player will have a hangar with equipment, and you will have to compete with your rivals in accuracy, speed and combat power. Lightning solutions and accurate calculation will lead you to a sure victory!<br/><br/>Winners consist of a deck of cards that are equally distributed to all players. Unfolded cards lie in front of players in stacks, face down. Then one of them opens the top card in his pile and looks at the parameters of the tanks indicated in its upper part.<br/>The player announces what parameter the competition will take: mass, power, speed or shooting, after which all other players open the top card from their piles. The one from whom the chosen parameter will be maximized takes the opened cards to himself, puts them under the bottom of his stack and makes the following move: he opens the card and chooses the parameter by which the tanks compete.<br/>The game ends at the moment when one of the players runs out of cards. The winner is the one who has the most cards in the pile. In the rules there is also the option of a long game, when the game ends only when there is only one player left with the cards.<br/>The kit includes a promo card of the Soviet T-54 tank for World of Tanks: Rush.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Wired.Com review of The Goonies 25th Anniversary Edition DVD Set:<br/><br/>&quot;.... the set&rsquo;s true treasure - a special Goonies-themed board game.<br/><br/>The bulk of the box set&rsquo;s real estate is devoted to this game, and immediately upon cracking open the shrink wrap you are taken by its diminutive size. Still, if The Goonies taught us anything it&rsquo;s that size doesn&rsquo;t always matter, and I&rsquo;m happy to report that this is the case here. Though the board itself is only about half the size of your average game, it&rsquo;s actually a brilliantly colored fold-up printed on super sturdy laminated stock that appears perfectly capable of standing up to multiple years&rsquo; worth of play sessions. The same can be said for the game&rsquo;s Move Cards which, while not quite as brawny as most CCG cards, are thick enough to get the job done.<br/><br/>Gameplay is fairly simple and properly reflects the spirit of the source materials - players take the role of one of five Goonies (Mikey, Data, Mouth, Chunk or Andy) and use a three-card hand in an attempt to escape One-Eyed Willy&rsquo;s cave. Players disarm traps to collect Gold Doubloons, and the first to reach the &quot;Escape&quot; square with three such Doubloons wins the game. The process is complicated by a trio of tricky Skull Spaces (only one of which contains the necessary key) that must be passed to reach the exit. This is balanced out by a fun selection of Special Move Cards that allow players to switch places with or steal gold from opponents. While certainly not the most engaging board game experience in movie fandom, it does manage to channel the proper amount of nostalgia and charm in a small but effective package.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Who can help them to create the most beautiful and most colorful parade in the shortest amount of time?<br/><br/>From the Ravensburger website:<br/>Let&acute;s have an elephant parade! There are several parade routes that need to be filled, and the colored spaces along the route will tell you exactly which little elephant needs to be next. You have to have two large and six small elephants in your parade. In order to add your elephants, pay close attention to the color that has been rolled on the die. If the color on the die matches the color for the elephant that has to be next in your parade line, then carefully connect the matching color elephant to the elephant in front of him. The first player to have all of their little elephants in the parade wins. What Do You Learn? Color recognition, dexterity.<br/><br/>Ages 3-7.<br/><br/>",

The cards have the name of the location on one side and a map on the other side, showing contiguous locations.<br/><br/>The object is to void your hand by playing a card with something that shares a borderline with the last card played. Wild cards when played are automatically considered a match and can then be named as any location in the deck except for those in the player's hand. If a player cannot play a contiguous card, cards are drawn from the deck and added to the player's hand until a card can be played.<br/><br/>Instead of drawing, a player can play a card that does not share a borderline and hope to not be challenged. Challenges can happen after any play. If the challenging player is correct, and the card played does not share a borderline, then the challenged player has to take back the card and take a card from the challenging player's hand. If the challenge is incorrect, the challenger takes a card from the deck and the challenged player gets another turn.<br/><br/>",

After all the cards have been played, players look through the cards they won, and use them to fill in a &quot;Family Tree&quot; card. The first player to fill in their family tree up to great-great-grandparents is the winner.<br/><br/>The deck of 60 cards is comprised of 4 colors (or suits) numbered 1 to 15. There are 5 ancestor cards in the blue suit (1, 5, 7, 9, 13), 4 in the yellow suit (4, 6, 8, 12), and 3 ancestor cards in the red (4, 6, 8) and green (5, 7, 9) suits.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Starting in 1997, Glenn Rahman designed an extension to his fabulous game Divine Right.  Scarlet Empire took place in a different period in that game's world, and further to the south of the original map.  It was designed as a stand alone game that could also be played in combination with the other one.  The campaign game pits most of the players against the one playing the Scarlet Witch King.<br/><br/>If you liked Divine Right, you'd like Scarlet Empire -- everything that made the first game great is also present in the other.  Mercenaries, special locations, diplomacy, magic, etc.<br/><br/>Scarlet Empire was supposed to be published by Excalibre Games and made it as far as the advanced play-test stages, but the publisher hemmed and hawed and tried to cut costs, so much so Glen eventually gave up in disgust.  A very few play-test copies are in existence as a result.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Divine Right<br/><br/><br/>",

It can be thought of as a puzzle, with square pieces, that has multiple solutions.<br/><br/>On one side of the tiles, the &quot;Rosetta&quot;, 1-3 players work together to make a 6x6 square picture. When complete, the picture shows different coloured flowers, each made up of two corresponding square pieces. You may choose to use the 4 joker tiles as wild cards.<br/><br/>On the other side, &quot;Puncola&quot;, you are creating a 6x6 square picture by matching the edges of the tiles with a similar pattern on an adjacent tile. At the corners of certain tiles is a 1/4 circle that is paired with 3 other tiles to form a complete circle.<br/><br/>&quot;Domino-Puncola&quot; is an alternate version of the game that adds competition. Each player picks 5 tiles at random and, in turn, tries to match an edge of the &quot;Puncola&quot; side to a tile on the table. If that person cannot place his/her tile, he/she draws a new one. The first person to place all of his/her tiles is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The Pawns start at the bottom-most spaces on the board and try to move up to the large, central top-most space: THE PIEDESTAL. Meanwhile, the Knights guard the PIEDESTAL and try to remove the Pawns from the game before they can reach the PIEDESTAL.<br/><br/>The Pawns win the game if five of them reach the PIEDESTAL, otherwise the Knights win.<br/><br/>SETUP: The twelve Pawns are placed three to a corner on the three lowest level spaces in each corner. The eight Knights are placed next to the PIEDESTAL, on all eight of the second-highest spaces on the board.<br/><br/>MOVE: A Pawn can move to a space on the next higher level directly beside it. Or it can move any number of spaces around the same level, unless blocked by another Pawn or Knight. The Knights can move the same way, with the additional advantage of moving either to a lower or higher level.<br/><br/>CAPTURING: During his turn, if a player is able to capture an opponent's piece, he must do so instead of making an ordinary move. To make a capture, the player moves his piece onto his opponent's space, and removes the opponent's piece from the board. A Pawn is able to capture a knight only if the Knight is one level higher than the Pawn, and directly beside the Pawn. A Knight is able to capture a Pawn only if the two pieces are on the same level, and directly beside one another. A player can never make more than one capture in his turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is distantly related to the Mill game or Nine Men's Morris, in that the object is to make alignments of three pieces: each such alignment created removes one opposing piece (miller's choice).  You win when you've reduced the opponent to two pieces or put him in such a bind that he cannot move.  If both players become immobilized, a draw occurs.<br/><br/>The 5&times;6 board is set up by both players by plunking down each of their 12 pieces alternately.  Strategy is crucial during this phase.  The only restriction is that alignments of three cannot be formed during this phase.  Once all pieces are set up, on your turn you move one of your pieces one space horizontally or vertically (diagonals aren't allowed or considered).<br/><br/>Strategies are alluded to but not explained in the short rules.  Shan Ruwa (&quot;to drown&quot;) consists of setting up so as to force the opponent to place in positions that will aid the starting player and drown the opponent.  Conversely, Turi (&quot;to push&quot;) prevents the starting player from forming alignments and makes his opening move bad for him.<br/><br/>A mill is called here Doki (&quot;galloping horse&quot;).  It is a combination of five pieces such that you form an alignment on each leg of the back-and-forth motion of the fifth piece.  The game terms are all taken from Hausa, a West-African language (presumably the first author's maternal tongue).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 1966 publication is a fairly simple roll and move contest to collect electoral votes. The center of the board has an outline map of the United States with the Electoral College votes of each state marked. The map divides the states into six color-coded regions.<br/><br/>Players move around the edge of the board on a 64-square track. Most of these are individual states, and landing on one allows a player to take the state if uncommitted or to contest it if held by another player. To contest, he rolls 2D6, and on a 2-6 wins the state, while on 7-12 the challenged party gets to take a state in the same region from a challenger.<br/><br/>There is a deck of Political Fortune cards which are collected on eight of the spaces. These can be positive or negative: losing a state or a turn or even all states in a region; or winning states and becoming a &quot;favorite son&quot; in a state, which confers unchallengeable ownership of that state for the rest of the game.<br/><br/>When a player collects the majority of the states in one of the six regions, he takes over all the electoral college votes for the region and all of those states are locked (can no longer be challenged). First player to 270 Electoral College votes wins.<br/><br/>",

It includes smaller scenarios for shorter games, including a recreation of the Millennium Falcon's escape from the Death Star after rescuing Princess Leia.<br/><br/>While the box says 2-8 players, like many of Tsukada's games, over two players means &quot;get on one of the two teams and share the counters&quot;; it's really a 2 player game.<br/><br/>Some game boxes have the Star Wars logo in the upper right front corner covered with an Empire Strikes Back logo. The game recreates the events of the first film, but at the time the game was published in 1982, Empire was the most recent film in theaters.<br/><br/>The rule book and back of the box have a typo in English: &quot;May the forth be with you!&quot;<br/><br/>",

There is a series of games for different age levels, all designed to familiarize players with these architectural styles.<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/>&quot;GOOD OLD HOUSES is a series of games about American architecture. The objective in all the games is to entertain while building an awareness of some basic architectural styles. The houses in this set are illustrations of general styles rather than portrayals of specific, existing buildings. (Neighborhood houses seldom show all the style traits illustrated here. In some houses only a single feature makes a style recognizable, while in others there is a mixture of style traits.) The range of styles, from Federal to Bungalow, isn't intended to encompass the breadth of American architectural history, but to represent the basic building styles most frequently employed between the late 18th and early 20th centuries when the greatest thrust of settlement and urban development occurred in the United States. After playing the games in GOOD OLD HOUSES, players will be more observant of houses in their own neighborhoods and better able to describe what they see.<br/><br/>&quot;The eight house puzzles (12 pieces per puzzle) are used in four different games for 2 to 8 players. The games are divided into three levels determined by age: under 8, 8 and over, 10 and over.&quot;<br/><br/>",

One receives information by means of the Mox panels, which each player has, as well as the so-called Rho and Kyra panels. The player can use the Rho panels to extend the points of the dice, Kyra panels bring knowledge questions, which, if they are answered correctly, teleport the figure on any field. The Mox panels let&rsquo;s the player look at Mox-cards of other players.<br/>The player wins, who knows where Microlino is, is located on that field and gets an 11 or higher or the same two numbers after throwing his dice.<br/><br/>",

Clues to these elements are attached to the characters (for example, whether the killer was male or female, a family member or servant, etc.) and the pieces placed on the board.  The murderer can have a false clue.<br/><br/>The solving player moves a detective figure around the board (which shows the floor plan of a small mansion and garden) encountering characters and looking at their clues.  The setter gets turns to move characters to get away (presumably) from the detective.  The object is to solve the mystery in as few turns as possible - as in other games of this type it is always played twice, with the roles reversed for the second game.<br/><br/>The pieces really make the game - the characters are large Lucite blocks with simple pictures on the fronts and metal circles on the backs - the clues are on small magnets which attach to the circles.  In addition, a piece of red plastic is provided to serve as the pool of blood in which the victim is found.<br/><br/>",

Each card of the deck depicts a unique combination of ingredients and special symbols. Players are called to identify, after three cards have been placed face up on the table, how many complete breakfasts can be put together. As you may know, a &quot;complete&quot; breakfast is made up of milk, coffee, sugar and donuts: all you have to do is quickly count all the relevant symbols on the cards but careful! The waiter's hand cancel an ingredient, while the &quot; 2&quot; doubles it... can you still find out how many happy clients you will have? If yes, congratulations!, but in order to score you still have to be the fastest to do so! After 9 rounds the game ends, and whoever has scored the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.<br/><br/>",

At the end of the process, one type is left on the raft and you score for each card you have kept of that type. In the short game, you go through the process once, in the long game, you repeat the process, removing cards from the deck each round.<br/><br/>The cards have nice graphics of the crew, the captain, the cook, the look-out, the cabin-boy, the dancing girl, the parrot and so on, each with values 1-9. Players are dealt a hand and five cards are dealt up in a row, and several cards are dealt face down in a column. The first of these is turned up and each turn the next is shown. At the end of the round, the type with the majority points is the one ejected.<br/><br/>Players play one card from their hand and draw from the row, and so try to manipulate events, especially by using the parrot. Unlike the others, the parrot has special abilities, allowing you to sneak a look at the last 2 cards in the face-down column, add another card to the column or thrown one out.<br/><br/>It took a while to get the hang of the game and it's an odd mix of switching tactics, but the long variant may be too elongated for repeated play.<br/><br/>",

It's perhaps best described by the rules introduction:<br/><br/>The game is suitable for all ages and beliefs,  and is based on a synthesis of orthodox Christian beliefs and practices over the past two millennia, The board is divided into spaces representing services or works as well as Temptations, Acts of Divine Providence and various Benevolent or Malevolent eventualities administered by the Church. The aim is for each player or soul to gather sufficient Heavenly Credits to be assured of Salvation and to avoid Damnation.<br/><br/>One difference from Monopoly is that a player can win immediately by landing on the Eternal Salvation space with adequate credit or be eliminated by landing on the Eternal Damnation space without enough.<br/><br/>Rather than building houses and hotels on the green properties, one can employ priests, canons, bishops, archbishops and saints on a mission to the satanic intelligentsia. There is a fine for using &quot;cash&quot;, &quot;money&quot; or similar terms instead of &quot;heavenly credits&quot;.<br/><br/>Production values are reasonable for what is probably a self-published game. The board is only on thin card, but the heavenly credits, mission cards and providence and temptation cards are similar to what one sees in Monopoly. The playing pieces are small metal figurines and there are cardboard discs for clerical staff rather than wooden or plastic houses.<br/><br/>",

Gameplay is the usual roll-the-die-and-take-a-card fare.  Playing pieces are photographs of the toys mounted on cardboard with plastic bases.  The board is a fairly impressive 3-D cardboard creation that takes a few minutes to set up.  When assembled, the board is four levels high.  Bottom level is the main board and players start in the middle of each side on their home spaces.  There are two stairways with bridges to the second level--a ring of spaces that sits above the center of the board.  The third level is a smaller ring set above this one.  Fourth level is a single space that sits above this.  Baron Karza, the bad guy, starts on level four.  If the characters land on certain spaces, they check the &quot;Intruder Control&quot;--a cardboard dial with its face hidden by a movable window.  They turn the dial however they wish, then open the window to see if Karza stays where he is, or teleports to one of four numbered spaces on the board.  Players must land on Karza's space by exact count to capture him.  Players may also land on their opponents' spaces, forcing said opponents to return to their starting space.<br/><br/>",

A variant of the Axis &amp; Allies board game system,  it offers an easy to play D10 based combat system and territories with resource values for production. <br/>The Spanish Civil War provides two game scenarios. In the historical scenario the Spanish Nationalists and the German/Italian support forces face off against the Spanish Republican forces and their Soviet allies along with the volunteer brigades. The Republic begins game play with more productivity, but must face a stronger Nationalist army and hold ground against it.<br/><br/>The second scenario allows for an alternate historical scenario. In this scenario, both Britain and France, who approved of neither the Republic or Nationalists, move to support a Portuguese invasion of Iberia. This is a 3-6 player scenario pitting three unaligned forces against each other for control of both Spain and Portugal.<br/><br/><br/>",

The first player to fill his or her shelf (a separate board for each player) completely is the winner.<br/>The main board represents the stores and is covered with face-down toy cards. Players roll a die and move through the stores accordingly (in any direction). Then they have a look at the card on the store they reached - if they want to buy it, they pay one Mark and put the card in front of them (not on their shelf yet!) and refill the store with a new card; if not, they put it back. Once in a while they should go to their home base to put the collected animals on their shelf, because the die also contains a side marked &quot;B&quot;: A player rolling a B loses all the toys in front of him/her (but not those in their shelves); these are then put into a large toy box. A player who rolls a B without having any cards in front of him/her, gets all the toys from the box. There are some special cards which can be found in the stores; these give the players extra money or buying options. Players reaching the same store are also allowed to trade cards as they see fit.<br/><br/>",

Isis S&uuml;sse S&uuml;nde is the first board game that incorporates eating, exercise and life's little guilty pleasures in a fun and enjoyable game. Even so, players quickly learn the caloric values of various food types and how much energy is used up by various activities.<br/><br/>The food pyramid is an important help in making sure players get a balanced diet. During the game, players collect food cards and add together the calorie values shown on the cards. Once a player has gone over the maximum number of calories dictated by the game (1750-2250 kcal), then that player must move their figure along the exercise track. By drawing an exercise card, the player may then reduce their calorie total by the indicated number of calories again. But just as in real life, sweet treats and unexpected events make it hard to keep on track and so make it harder to win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game box include : a totally black 3d 9x9 board , 18 red dice, 18 black dice and a manual.The dice have the French card symbols on their sides (hearts , diamonds , clubs  and spades) and are called knights. If the symbol is surrounded by a square it is called &quot;prince&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is similar to chess in general concepts. To win you have to &quot;catch the king&quot; with &quot;princes&quot; and &quot;knights&quot; represented by dice.<br/>You move &quot;knights&quot; by one space at a time, rolling them on the board. &quot;Princes&quot; can move, rolling or not, by any space number.<br/>You may capture an opponent piece when your dice shows the same symbol of the opponent's one on his top and when they are in line.<br/>In Italy the game was published in 80' by Mondadori Giochi  but it was probably distributed in all Europe as on the back of the game box there is a short description in many languages.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Planet Management Game&trade;<br/><br/>Players have a high paying job with University Planet Management Associates. This team has been given the task of managing the planet Clarion for the next 50 years. Note that a Clarion year is much shorter than our own.<br/><br/>A brief history of Clarion (from the game manual)<br/><br/>The plant Clarion is much like the Earth in size, climate, and geography. However, the land area is smaller than the Earth&rsquo;s. The living things on the planet are similar to plants and animals on Earth with one exception &ndash; there is no native animal like man.<br/>      About 10 years ago the Council of Civilized Planets transported 100,000 colonists to Clarion from the planet Rasmuss. These colonists are similar to people, but are smaller. They have shorter life spans than people and look a little different, too. You could call them &ldquo;humanoids.&rdquo; Their food is similar to ours.<br/>      The natural state of Clarion is like Earth&rsquo;s before man began to change it. Some of the land is flat and has a mild climate that is good for farming. There are some deserts of purple sand. They are fiery hot during the day and cold at night. There are other regions of bare rock that separate the fertile areas. All the land is on one continent. The rest of the planet is a blue-green ocean much less salty than Earth&rsquo;s.<br/>      There seems to be only one major threat to life on Clarion &ndash; the disease Holobinkitis. It attacks both plants and animals, Clarionmen included. No one knows the cause of the disease or a cure for it. It is almost always fatal if you catch it.<br/>      Clarion has one large and unusual mineral deposit. The mineral is Walterite ore. In fact, Clarion is the only known planet with such large deposits. Several scientists say that the metal obtained from the ore is superior to iron or steel for most uses. However, Walterite is usually found under a thick layer of hard rock. Thus, it is often difficult to mine.<br/>      In comparison to Earth, Clarion has a low standard of living. The Clarionmen don&rsquo;t produce all the things need and want. As a result, they are thrifty. They don&rsquo;t like to spend money unless it&rsquo;s absolutely necessary. Then they want to get a &ldquo;good deal: for every bit of money they spend.<br/>      They have some of the same problems the Pilgrims had when they first settled in North America. Food sometimes becomes scarce, and it is expensive to import food from other planets. One of the big problems with raising crops is that the insects on Clarion really like to eat them. Therefore, a large part of every crop is lost to insects.<br/>      Most of the Clarionmen say they will stay on in spite of the hardships. They believe Clarion has a bright future once things get going. The Clarionmen usually give three reasons for leaving their home planet of Rasmuss:<br/>      1: It was getting too crowded there.<br/>      2. There was a promise of a better life on Clarion.<br/>      3, Clarion is a beautiful place to live.<br/>Most Clarionmen have a strong appreciation for beauty, and they enjoy nature. They look forward to more leisure time outdoors.<br/><br/>End quote from game manual<br/><br/>As manager of Clarion, the players will keep track of four variables: population, income, food, and environment. They are given a budget of 10 bux (a Clarion buc is equivalent to about one million U.S. dollars) to fund planetary project for the next five years. Each budget will determine which projects Clarion will fund for the following five years. In the course of the complete game ten 5-year budgets will be prepared.<br/><br/>On turn one Clarion&rsquo;s population index is at 100, each unit representing 1000 Clarion citizens. The income index and the food index also start at 100. When the population index equals income index, citizens have enough money to buy basic necessities. If income exceeds population, Clarion citizen&rsquo;s standard of living will have improved. When the population index equals the food index there is enough food to provide each citizen with a well-balanced but simple diet. If food index falls below the population index, citizens are going hungry, perhaps even starving.<br/><br/>When humans first landed on Clarion, the environment index was 100. The air was pure, the oceans and river clean, the land beautiful. In the first years of colonizing Clarion, the environment index has decreased to 90. The population would like the environment restored so that environment index is at least as high as the population index. However, they would also like the income and food indices to increase relative to the population index as well.<br/><br/>For each budget, players have 10 bux to spend on projects. There are five different groups of projects that may be funded: red, blue, orange, yellow, and green. Each group (or color) contains three projects, only one of which may be funded. Each funded project may be funded for 2, 4, or 6 bux. Of course any group with no funded projects costs no bux.<br/><br/>Red (Agricultural Improvement projects)<br/>1) Clear more land and prepare it for raising crops.<br/>2) Import chemical fertilizers and pesticides.<br/>3) Buy machinery to plant, cultivate, and harvest crops.<br/><br/>Blue (Scientific Research projects)<br/>1) Conduct research to develop new varieties of corn, wheat, and rice with higher yields per acre.<br/>2) Conduct research to identify the cause and cure of Holobinkitis.<br/>3) Conduct research to find better ways to mine and use Walterite.<br/><br/>Orange (Industrial Expansion projects)<br/>1) Build more Walterite mines and purification plants.<br/>2) Build more highways and railroads to connect towns.<br/>3) Construct new electric power plants.<br/><br/>Orange (Public Education projects)<br/>1) Build more schools for all age groups and for general, professional, and technical education,<br/>2) Pay people to go to graduate schools of civil engineering, biochemistry, medicine, and agriculture.<br/>3) Finance the Einstein Plan: a) send a few of the most capable individuals to Earth for advanced study, and b) connect more Clarion homes to the educational television network.<br/><br/>Green (Industrial &amp; Residential Pollution Control projects)<br/>1) Construct more and improved treatment plants for city and factory waste.<br/>2) Finance the Wright Plan: a) buy areas of land around lakes and oceans to be used for recreation, b) build mile-high apartment buildings surrounded by 100 acre parks in the center of cities.<br/>3) Equip more chimneys of homes, industries, and other buildings with antismoke equipment.<br/><br/>The mechanics of playing this game:<br/>A major part of this game is the 50 8&frac12; x 11&rdquo; cards. These cards have a variety of small holes punched in them similar to early IBM punch cards. Each of the 15 possible projects has 3 cards: a 2 bux, a 4 bux, and a 6 bux card. And in case no project for a given color is funded, there is also a zero bux card for each of the five colors. To make their budget, the players select one card of each of five colors not to exceed their 10 bux limit. When the players have chosen their five cards, the five cards are stacked together revealing one (and only one) hole that is open in all of them.<br/><br/>The game also includes a data book. This book contains data pages for Population Change, Income Change, Food Change, and Environment Change for the different rounds of the game. For the first round of the game, the players turn to the &ldquo;Rounds 1 &amp; 2&rdquo; pages, where they are presented with four different population change pages.<br/><br/>It is almost quaint to realize that this game was made in the days before Dungeons &amp; Dragons and the ready availability of four sided dice. The data book carefully explains how to flip a coin twice to generate a random number from 1 to 4.<br/><br/>The players then lay their group of five project cards on the randomly selected data sheet to determine how much that particular datum has changed. This process is followed for population, income, food, and environment changes. The final results are written down, and play advances to the next round.<br/><br/>To play round 2, players select another set of projects and proceed as they did in round 1, possible selecting different projects.<br/><br/>As play progresses through rounds 3 - 10, the appropriate pages of the data book are used. Blank graphs are provided to help players visualize the results of their chosen projects.<br/><br/>The game is completed at the end of 10 rounds. The players are then asked if they think the citizens of Clarion would be pleased with the state of their planet at the end? Did their team mange Clarion well? Could the same results have been achieved with less money?<br/><br/>After playing the game, the management team should decide how well it did. If they play the game again, they can try to do better. They can decide what is better. Comparing the results with those of another team, who did the better job. Here are some things to think about in deciding a winner or which job of Planet Management was best:<br/>1) Were the same results obtained by spending less money?<br/>2) Which set of final index values would you prefer to live with?<br/>3) Do food and income indices compare favorably with the population index?<br/>4) If things continued to change in the same way for another fifty years, would Clarion be a good place to live?<br/><br/>",

The white die is numbered 1 through 6. A player rolls the dice and reads the black die first and the white die last. So if a 5 and a 2 are thrown, the number generated would be 52, and if the numbers are Blank and 6 the number generated would be 6.<br/><br/>The game comes with a table layout that resembles a standard Roulette layout although the numbers are shown in a 6x6 grid. Most, but not all, Roulette wagers (numbers, columns, dozens, black/red etc.) may be made, and the payoffs are the same as a standard game of Roulette.<br/><br/>",

If the player rolls the red chip symbol on the die, the player has to place a red chip on their own path. If a path has red chips on every space, that path is unusable, and if any wooden planks are left on the corresponding corner, the players lose the game because they cannot finish the tower.<br/><br/>As this is a cooperative game, players can give away die rolls, and offer to have chips placed on their own path, to help the other players.<br/><br/>",

A 6 by 6 frame is assembled, and each player takes turns placing two tiles at a time to build the maze, leaving two empty spots.  The maze tiles contain 12 energy points of each color.  Unlike Double Morphus, the maze is not three dimensional.<br/><br/>Each player has 3 guards and a trover.  The object of the game is to collect all energy points of a player's given color, or to capture the opponent's trover.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player may move all of his pieces 10 squares each.  Guards may move orthogonally only, and trovers may move both orthogonally and diagonally.  Only trovers may collect energy points.  Guards serve to block movement.<br/><br/>Energy points may be spent to &quot;morph&quot; a maze tile by sliding it into an adjacent empty square.  Each point spent allows two such morphs.  Tiles containing a trover may not be morphed.<br/><br/>To capture an opposing trover, it must be immobilized by a combination of enemy guards, walls, empty space, or enemy energy points for one full turn.  A trover can force itself past an enemy guard by surrendering either an energy point or the life of a friendly guard.<br/><br/>",

It involves rolling dice and comparing the rolls against charts to find the outcomes.  It was not licensed by any league, so there are only fictional players in the game.<br/><br/>There are a few decisions made during the game.  You can move your outfielders to different positions depending on the situation.  You may choose to roll on a stolen base chart or a bunting chart or a hit and run chart.<br/><br/>It appears that this was planned to be a series of games.  The box says &quot;1st in a series&quot; and states that it is part of the Classic Park Collection.

Judging by the fact that the game lasts five days of the campaign (the 16th to 20th of Dec) and the units included (no SS, but the 2nd PZ and Lehr Pz Divisions), I would guess that the game covers the opening assault by the 5th Panzer Army against Clervaux and the 28th US infantry division. <br/>The game has battalion-sized units almost exclusively. Units have only one combat number and some sort of morale or training rating as there are several units with one or two stars between the combat and movement numbers. The main thing is that the game uses strength points reduction-there are roster sheets for record-keeping of unit losses. The CRT is by strength point loss and there is a detailed chart for CRT modifiers, presumably for combined arms. Also, next to the strength point boxes are a number of boxes for each unit for each day. I would gather that the game tracks unit fatigue as well. There are barrage and range values on artillery and support and range numbers on the regimental HQ units.<br/><br/>",

Cards depict Power Rangers, bad guys, or puzzle pieces. Each player simultaneously turns over their top card and the player with the highest value card wins them all. If there's a tie, the tying players continue turning over cards one at a time until someone turns over a higher value card. The player that wins the trick takes all point cards and places them in a separate pile (to be counted up later). Then the winner collects all puzzle cards and puts them in the center of the table either starting or adding to a puzzle. There are 2 six-piece puzzles: one depicting a Megazord, and one depicting Rita Repulsa. The game ends when either puzzle is completed. If the Megazord puzzle is completed, the point values on Power Ranger cards are added up. If the Rita Repulsa puzzle is completed, the point values on bad guy cards are added up. The player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Get the answer right and your foot is on the accelerator, get it wrong and you are going backwards!<br/><br/>Though (motoring) trivia based there are many variables which can improve or reduce your chances of winning: The circuit itself is tortuous so keeping to the racing line is essential.  Hazard and weather cards, which can turn the track into a skid-pan make life interesting so choice of tires is critical, as is choice of fuel.<br/><br/>Game Contents:-<br/>1 x playing board<br/>1 x blue dice<br/>1 x red dice<br/>6 x coloured lap counters<br/>6 x coloured racing helmets<br/>388 x motorsport cards<br/>12 x tyre cards<br/>1 x set of red rocket fuel tokens<br/>1 x set of blue fuel tokens<br/>1 x lap counter board<br/>1 x rules sheet<br/><br/>The box notes describe this game as a fast action game of skill, strategy, and racing knowledge.<br/><br/>You need a very good general knowledge of motorsport to enjoy this game to the full, but the rules include a shorter, faster version of the game can be played by using only the hazard cards and no questions, making game-play much less difficult.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to eliminate all of your opponents pieces, before they do the same to you.<br/><br/>BFMG also uses the popular method of collectible miniatures. All of the electronic figurines (e-figs) have a special quality about them, ranging from commons to rares. Additionally you will find that some commons are more common than others, or that some rares are very difficult to come across. Additionally there are gold e-figs. You only have a 1/25 chance to pull one of these from a booster pack.<br/><br/>",

In this game, players progress along a game track.  Movement forward (or backward for incorrect answers) is determined by the level of difficulty you are attempting.<br/><br/>There are several types of square, which determine who may answer the question.  A solo square means only the person whose marker is on the square may answer.  A Free-For-All square means all players have the opportunity to answer.  A Proxy square means the active player chooses another player to answer for them; the active player advances on the correct answer, but the proxy goes back if they answer incorrectly.  A Blitz square allows everyone to answer as the active player reads the clues from most difficult to easiest.  As soon as someone answers correctly, they and the active player move ahead the number of squares matching the level of clue that was the question was answered on.<br/><br/>Each players turn finishes after one move.<br/><br/>There are also Providence cards, which usually result in either going forward or back a number of squares.<br/><br/>First to reach the finish square wins.<br/><br/>",

The board is molded plastic, and it came with hundreds of counters, cards and scrip.<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/>Buying and selling is fun when you play Petticoat Lane, where each player tries to become the most successful trader.<br/><br/>Each player has his own market stall, which he opens with a stock of highly unusual articles, never before offered for sale.  As the game progresses he sells these articles, and with the money made, buys more stock.<br/><br/>Each player tries to outsell his trading rivals by attempting to corner the market on some articles, by changing his prices, and by holding promotional sales.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the players succeeds in selling all his stock.  The winner is the player who has made the most money - unsold stock has no value.<br/><br/>",

Red starts.<br/><br/>Players move alternately on black or gold squares, one piece at a time, one square at a time, in any direction.<br/><br/>Entry into the inner circles may on be gained through the bridges provided. When a player gets one of his pieces to the center that piece is removed and can be placed on any vacant square on the outside edge of the board where it can be brought back into play again, providing that it is that player's turn. The first player to get four of his/her pieces into the center of the board is the winner.<br/><br/>Players may also win by a &quot;wipe out&quot;. This is when a player has captured the majority of an opponent's pieces so that the opponent cannot realistically attain the winning score of four.<br/><br/>A player may move diagonally across all bridges except the two bridges at the center, where the player has to move directly on to the bridge.<br/><br/>Pieces may be captured by jumping in any direction - forwards , backwards, sideways or diagonally. A player can capture several opposing pieces by including changes of direction in his move.<br/><br/>Pieces may only be jumped once during any sequence of moves, captured pieces then leave the board on completion of the move. Jumping is optional - it is at a player's discretion whether to execute all possible jumps.<br/><br/>If a situation arises where a player cannot move, then his opponent can move as many times as he likes until either he wins or an opening is made for the stationary player.<br/><br/>The first player to get four of his/her pieces into the center of the board is the winner.<br/><br/>",

If the player finishes on a  water hazard spot then a hazard card is taken and then penalty shown on the card carried out.<br/><br/>Players maneuver their tugs until they are in the space immediately in front of the ship that they have been directed to tow (this is decided by a secret card deal at the start of the game). At this point they are considered to have connected a tow-line to their charge.  They then tow the ship back across the board to that ship's designated mooring point, dealing with any hazards encountered on the way.<br/><br/>Once they have moored the ships in the appropriate berth, the tugs then have to return to their own mooring point.  The winner is the first player to have successfully towed his designated ship to the correct mooring point and then returned his/her tug to its mooring position.<br/><br/>",

In 1979 the game was re-published to include the Fatasy Creature Combat Set.   The original game contained 12 Dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Ankylosaurus<br/>Cetiosaurus<br/>Corythosaurus<br/>Dimetrodon<br/>Iguanodon<br/>Megalosaurus / Gorgosaurus<br/>Monoclonius<br/>Stegosaurus<br/>Styracosaurus<br/>Triceratops<br/>Tyrannosaurus<br/>Allosaurus<br/><br/>Three Dinosaurs were dropped from the 2nd edition, Cetiosaurus, Corythosaurus and Dimetrodon.   The individual dinosaur stats were also modified from the original stats.<br/><br/>Subtitled &quot;Wargame Rules for Dinosaur and Fantasy Creature Combat,&quot; this is a set of miniatures rules that covers just that.  The main thrust of the game is in the Jurassic and the Cretaceous, but rules have been added to allow dragons and other non-sentient fantasy monsters.  You can use any toy dinosaur or dragon figures you can find in toy and department stores - rules are given to adjust scale for size of the figures.<br/><br/>The rules cover creating the terrain and its effect on movement and combat.  Rules are given for the various types of dinosaur attacks (as well as fire-breathing) and defenses.  Various dinosaurs are covered in particular: Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus, Stegasaurus, Triceratops, Ankylosaurus, etc., and which period they were found in.  Actions are broken down into 12 phases: faster creatures get an action each phase, while a slower one might only act every third phase.  Rules are given for degrees of arc from the spinal plane a creature can bite or tail strike, and illustrations show where creatures are armored more heavily.  Lots of detail in this small booklet.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hut ab! is a small abstract game for two players, and it a bit of a shell game.  Players play 5 stones of their color on the 4x4 grid, with the goal to line up four of their color.  The players also each have three hats of their color they can use to play onto the board, to cover stones. On a player's turn, they either add a stone or hat to the board, or move a stone or hat on the board.  When they think they have four of their stones lined up, they remove the hats.  If they did not have their stones lined up, they lose.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game appears to be similar to Parcheesi in certain ways.  The goal of the game is to get all four of your pieces around the track on the board from your starting area to your goal area.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player draws a card from the deck.  There are four each of twelve different cards in the deck.  Each card names and describes a location in Williamsburg.  Scattered about the game board are text for each of these locations and how they affect your pieces in the game.  10 of the locations move one of your pieces forward different amounts, 1 location moves one of your pieces backwards and 1 location causes you to lose a turn.  The player determines which of their pieces they want to move after drawing a card.<br/><br/>Various spaces on the track allow you to move your piece forward, backward or swap with an opponents piece when your piece lands on them.  Also on the track are four extra areas that allow you to advance two of your pieces when one of your pieces successfully lands on a specific space.<br/><br/>Unlike Parcheesi however, you cannot capture other player's pieces.  Opposing pieces can occupy the same space on the board without any penalty.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>- Mounted game board<br/>- 48 cards<br/>- 16 pawns (4 each of red, blue, green and yellow)<br/>- Rules sheet<br/><br/>",

Now you have to guess which number it landed on by guessing where the beeping stopped. If you guess correctly May do three things. You may move your own UFOs up to 5 spaces around the board aiming for earth. The five spaces movement may be distributed over your pieces at your discretion. You may Move the Large UFO to a new location and you can also &quot;ZAP&quot; another player back into outer space.<br/>If your guess is wrong, the other players get a free move of five spaces each.<br/><br/>Pieces can be moved in either direction and landing on another player's piece will block them from moving. The stacks can be many pieces high you you can park multiple UFOs on other players.<br/>Another thing, the Large UFO can be leapfrogged towards the center. So being able to move it can give you an advantage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Slots'n Dots is contains 48 plastic chips (six each of the numbers 1 through 7, portrayed with different numbers of dots, plus three each of single-ring and double-ring chips).  It is played on a special plastic board which contains seven recessed areas that allow a chip to be placed face-up and six slots that hold a chip invisibly.  The board is arranged with a single recess at the center surrounded by an alternating pattern of recesses and slots.<br/><br/>There are several different ways to play:  a basic game, two levels of advanced play, a children's version, and a variety of optional rules.  All follow the same basic theme:  after the board is set up with chips in some or all of the recesses and slots, players take turns drawing a chip for the center recess and looking for patterns of chips (generally lines or triangles) containing runs of consecutive numbers.  When a player spots a pattern on his or her turn, he or she takes one of the non-central chips from the pattern and moves the chip from the center of the board into the vacated spot.  If the player cannot find a pattern, the center chip is instead taken off the board as a &quot;dead chip&quot; that can be played later in place of a random draw.  Single-ring chips are wild, and double-ring chips allow other chips to be stolen from opponents.  The game ends when the chip supply is exhausted and no more dead chips can be played -- at this point, players add up the values of the chips they collected and subtract any dead chips to determine to winner.<br/><br/>In the more advanced variations of the rules, legal patterns and playable areas of the board change so that slots are used more and more, adding a stronger element of memory to the game.<br/><br/>",

The letter it points to is the word-start letter.  The arrow is spun again and the person it points to must say a letter.  This letter must follow on from the word-start letter.  Play continues until a word is finished that cannot be extended.  If a player is successfully challenged (a &lsquo;finished&rsquo; word can still be extended) the player forfeits a knowledge card.  The spin card is used when a player can&rsquo;t think of a way of extending a word or bluffing.  When a player loses both their knowledge cards they become a non-entity and are out of the game.  However they still play a role.  Non-entities must be completely ignored.  If a surviving player acknowledges a non-entity they lose a knowledge card.  The winner is the last survivor.<br/><br/>",

The 46 numbered cards are numbered 1-10, and there are two each of the Special cards, Skip, Reverse, Draw and Throw (Uno-like actions, with the Throw card forcing the next player to discard a card instead of having a turn). The cards 1 to 5 give the player the option to move the counter forward or backwards; the cards 6 to 10 are advance cards only.<br/><br/>There are three rounds. The winner of each round is the player who reaches the goal by using his last card to move the marker into the goal zone. The losing players pay the winner in chips the value of their remaining cards. The winner is obviously the player who has most chips at the end of three rounds.<br/><br/>The two sides of the board have the Standard and the Risky Wheel game. The Standard game&rsquo;s goal zone is 50 to 61. The Risky Wheel game offers less leeway as the goal is exactly 50.<br/><br/>The name Hictas comes from the Japanese verbs to subtract and to add.<br/><br/>",

After the first circuit of the board, players draw cards on every turn which may cause damage to the property landed on or specific named properties - the owners get paid if they have insurance policies but lose the properties without compensation if they do not. At the start of each circuit players collect income from every other player for each property they own. The object is to be the last player with money.<br/><br/>",

When a team lands on a space, the actor on that team (it changes every turn) must act out what's on the card in 30 seconds or less. The catch is, they *must* use sound - the rules include a provision where if the other team catches them not using sound, they lose credit for a right answer. Only sound effects - no speaking - are allowed however.<br/><br/>The board spaces are as follows: Action Reaction, which is a long form charade such as &quot;passing gas and blaming it on the dog.&quot; Famous Expressions is usually a cliche or popular phrase. People, Places &amp; Things is self explanatory.<br/><br/>The fourth category is &quot;Hot Spot.&quot; Five items are on this card, and the team gets 60 seconds. If the actor can convey three out of the five, they get credit and continue to roll and move. Getting all five earns a &quot;Safe &amp; Sound&quot; card. This can also be earned via its own space on the board. Safe &amp; Sound allows an actor to pass a charade - but only once on a given turn, regardless of the amount of S&amp;S cards they have.<br/><br/>Some spaces are designated all play by an arrow. The finish space of the game is an All-Play Hot Spot. Whichever team gets the majority of the five items in 60 seconds gets credit - and if you're on the team on the final Hot Spot space, that means you're the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players roll 1d6 and 1d4. The result is the number of squares you may move in two different directions but not diagonally. If you land exactly on an opponents piece it is captured and is taken to one of your own camps where it stays unless released by an opponents counter landing on the camp it is trapped in.<br/><br/>You can capture a fort in the same manner. If it is occupied by an opponents piece that too would be captured.<br/><br/>A fun little game which can be challenging and frustrating as you must use your exact die rolls and you must move! Can get tricky in the latter stages of the game! A good move and capture game.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>Board<br/>6 Roman Soldiers<br/>6 Pict Warriors<br/>1 D4<br/>1 D6<br/>Rules<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An entry in the 2001 About.com 8x8 Game Design Competition.<br/><br/>Triangulate is an abstract strategy board game that can be played with 'found objects.' In other words, it's a game, not unlike checkers or chess, but one that can be played with game pieces or other objects that you probably already have at home.<br/><br/>The first player decides which of their small pieces they would like to move first. In order to actually make the move, the player first takes one of their LARGE tokens and places it onto the square to which they intend to move a SMALL token. (The proposed square must be directly adjacent to the original square, touching on any side or corner) They then move their small token from its current position to the new square; placing it on top of the newly placed larger token. Then the next player takes his turn, etc. A player may move one of their small tokens onto a square already occupied by one of their own or one of their opponent's small token. In this case, the player does NOT place one of their large tokens in advance of the move, but simply places their small token on top of the other small token already in place. If this move is onto an opposing piece, that piece is not captured, but effectively blocked. Until the player on top moves their small token, the piece below may not move.<br/><br/>Play continues in this manner until one of the two players is able to Triangulate three of their own small pieces on a single square on the board.<br/><br/>",

The size and shape of the parallelograms adjust throughout the octagon to allow total coverage of the area.<br/><br/>The board contains 64 shaded parallelograms. Teammates sit across from each other, with opponents to the left and right. Diagonal movement, jumping, and kinging rules of traditional checkers apply in this game. However, the octagonal shape of the board causes the crowning rows to exist to ones left and right.<br/><br/>Players win by capturing or blocking from movement all opponents' pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game based on horse racing. There are six horses. Each horse is rated for its relative speed on each quarter of the track.<br/><br/>A hand held electronic gizmo selects the post position and regulates movement of each of the horses. It also determines the leading horse should two or more of them finish the race during the same turn.<br/><br/>Each player selects a horse for the duration of the game at random. The players also get two Crop Cards that may allow an extra movement for a player's horse when a card is spent. A Hold Back card is also given to be used in close race. The card is exchanged for a Crop Card and deducts two spaces from the horse's movement.<br/><br/>A player receives money for having one's horse finish in the top three and betting correctly. The player with the most money after three races is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Aseb, 'The Twenty Squares game' (frequently misidentified as Tjau, &lsquo;The Game of Thieves&rsquo; or &lsquo;The Game<br/>of Robbers&rsquo;) was played from 3000 B.C. until 400 A.D. and is one of the oldest known games. It is similar in play and design as Senet.<br/><br/>The object is to be the first player to bear off all 5 of his pieces, by landing them precisely on the last square.<br/>Once successfully borne off, a piece plays no further part in the game.<br/><br/>PLAYER TURNS<br/>The players throw once each alternately, and move a single piece by the appropriate number of positions. A<br/>move must be made, and made in full. If no move is possible, then the turn is forfeit (passes to the other<br/>player). When forfeiting a throw, the opponent has the option of adding the forfeited throw to his own.<br/><br/>HOW TO MOVE THE PIECES<br/>Each player enters the pieces onto the board from his reserve and moves them as follows:<br/>Pieces move forward only. As pieces reach the last square (by exact throw), they bear off; be the first to<br/>bear off all your pieces and you win! The marked squares give you an extra turn; when you land on them, you<br/>get to throw the sticks and go again. Only one piece may occupy any given square; if you land on an opposing<br/>piece, it is removed &mdash;sent back to the player&rsquo;s reserve.<br/>To bring your first piece on, you must first throw a 4 or a 6; when that happens, you throw again and move<br/>the piece in by that amount. The remaining pieces can be brought in on any throw. Waiting for that initial<br/>throw of 4 or 6, particularly while the opponent is already moving, can be quite frustrating, so it is an acceptable<br/>variant to forego that rule entirely.<br/><br/>",

It is a party game in the vein of Taboo or Activity, although the players do not paraphrase terms or play charades. Rather, the players try to solve picture puzzles faster than their opponents. In each round, one of the players acts as the moderator and chooses two picture cards, that together represent a two part noun (e.g. ball game (cards 73 and 20) or treasure chamber (cards 54 and 104)). The player may choose between asking an easy, medium or difficult question. Then the other players try to solve the puzzle, while a sand timer runs down. Depending on the difficulty, the player who calls out the correct answer first, may advance 2, 3, or 4 spaces on the track.  The first player to reach the goal is the winner. <br/>Inspiration features a clever card index box, to keep the picture cards organized and two bookmarks to quickly find where to put back the previously selected cards.<br/><br/>",

The board is designed to look like sheet music.  The element of chance is added by a spinner.  One unusual feature in some editions is a colorful six-note xylophone, with which players can make the Monkees theme tune, for which sheet music is included. Another edition includes a &quot;four string&quot; (two rubber band) plastic guitar along with the sheet music insert.<br/><br/>The box art is an illustration of the Monkees riding in a red GTO hot-rod convertible.<br/><br/>",

The Spellway track of the board keeps track of your total points, and the game is won by reaching the castle at the end of the track.<br/><br/>Several other features make it more like a board game race:<br/><br/>a) What you can do in your turn is determined by rolling a die and moving a shared piece around the S-track: you may draw 1-3 cards, discard a card, lay down a word, or draw a Spoiler card.  Several junctions allow choices of play.<br/><br/>b) The Spoiler cards allow you to give and/or take letter cards from other players.<br/><br/>c) The Spellway track has some spaces that let you try to spell a random word on a Speller card, for 5 extra points.  There are 2 levels of cards so different ages can play together.<br/><br/>d) If you play all your cards to spell a word, all the other players move back 1 space per card they hold, up to 3 max.<br/><br/>",

The banker issues $10,000 to each player. (The banker is considered a player as well.) After unfolding the board, the banker shuffles the 10 drill for oil cards and places one face down on each site. To drill for oil, it costs $10,000. The banker goes first, and must state which oil well he wants to drill for oil on. He must then appropriate $10,000 to drill. There are 10 stock certificates representing 10% ownership in a well being drilled. The player drilling may sell all the stock or part of the stock. He must, however, offer a percentage of stock depending on the amount of players. (50% for 2 player, 60% for 3 or 4 players, 80% for 5 players.) At times a player may have to buy all the stock in a well if no other players want to invest in it. After the $10,000 is raised, the player pays the bank and flips the card. If it says dry hole, the stock is worthless. If it says have struck oil, each player who invested receives the dividend stated on the card. (Amounts vary on 6 of the cards, 4 are dry holes.) Play continues to the left until all 6 oil producing wells have been drilled. The game then ends and the player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In and Out is a simple roll and move game based on a swimming &quot;Bath&quot;.  The edge of the pool is numbered 1 to 54.  Ten of the squares are entrances to the pool and when the player lands on them they must roll again and follow the path of a swimmer through the water back to the poolside.  The pool sections are similar to the familiar snakes and ladders, with one difference - the paths through the pool are marked out in squares and thus may represent delays as well as the usual short-cuts or backward steps.<br/><br/>The game appears to consist of only the board, counters and a die to be supplied by the player.  The instructions mention &quot;dice&quot; but it is likely that the game was intended to be played with one die.  Each player must roll &quot;3&quot; to begin and the exact number to finish which might be impossible with a pair of dice.<br/><br/>The board illustration is quite pleasant, possibly representing an Art Deco swimming pool.  All the swimmers are male, in red or blue trunks.<br/><br/>Valentine's Games were proud to proclaim the board as &quot;British Manufacture&quot;.  The game is marked as copyright, but this is undated, although the provenance of the game suggests the game to be no later than 1950.  It is marked G12 suggesting that other boards were available from Valentine's Games.<br/><br/>",
