        "description": "Zauber-Zoff is a fantasy card-game best played with 3-4 players, about a kingdom falling apart Each player is playing one scoundrel trying to amass as many riches as possible by winning battles (rounds).<br/>Since most of the 100 cards are unique and have interactions with other cards, each game is very different - and new situations arise every time you play. Since everybody draws from the same pile it might seem that it is more about luck than anything else, but a good player will probably best his mediocre opponents in three out of four games.<br/>So summon Elves, Goblins, Kings, Princes, Ogres and Dragons to loot Rings, Treasure or take the royal family for ransom.<br/>Playing in rounds, you either aim to win a round, just screw things up for the one who does win and/or try to just get as many new cards as possible for a whole gang of critters for you to play in the next.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the Back of the Box;<br/><br/>This expansion introduces The Under God, the architect of the Everrain, to be used as an optional replacement end game boss to the Avatar of The Under God. The Under God comes with its own unique set of Elder One boards, with a host of new dark powers and abilities to combat. From unfathomable depths, the nameless one finally comes to finish its work...<br/><br/>As the Avatar heralds its arrival, it was only a matter of time before the Old One itself arrived on the earth to claim its prize! Upon a great creature it rides, nestled in it's stone throne where it has sat for time immemorial.<br/><br/>The Old One offers a new boss to try and beat when playing the Everrain. The Old One behaves differently than the Avatar and has its own unique objectives to defeat it!<br/><br/>The Old One token begins the game at the end of the Discovery Track, and it represents how close the Avatar is to rising from the sea and destroying the world! Ordinarily this token rarely moves, but if enemies begin to gain the advantage and are allowed to run amok, the token will begin to descend down the track. If the Enemy and Old One tokens ever meet, then the Avatar awakens and appears on the game board!<br/><br/>The Avatar has its own board, which describes the effects that it has on the game. These are things that players must be wary of doing, because each time that the player triggers one of these effects, it brings the Avatar one step closer to arriving in the world.<br/><br/>For players to have a chance at winning, they have to trigger the endgame. This is done in one of 2 ways:<br/><br/>1. Reaching the end of the Discovery track - If players can do this, they have gathered enough knowledge to now attempt to subdue the Avatar. This is known as the Slumbering Objective<br/><br/>2. Defeating the Avatar - If at any point the Avatar is summoned, the end game immediately is triggered and players must defeat it somehow. This is known as the Arisen Objective<br/><br/>In both cases, once the endgame has been triggered the Avatar board is flipped, and the player's objective is revealed<br/><br/>",

Enjoy the new rules, new Sectorial Armies and Fireteams.<br/><br/>This book covers the events that took place on the planet of Paradiso and makes clear that the alien threat is becoming very tangible and real. The Combined Army is not going to surrender, and Paradiso is only a bump on the road towards conquering the entire Human Sphere. In terms of where it lands within the Infinity narrative, it takes place directly after the events of Campaign Paradiso.<br/><br/>Paradiso lives up to its namesake: an astonishing paradise full of exquisite flora and fauna. In the past, this planet was inhabited by an alien race, though not much is known about the native sentient species. Their presence still lives on by the way of vast construction sites that can be found all over the planet, known as cosmolitos. It&rsquo;s widely believed that these structures were the treasure that first caught the attention of the EI.<br/><br/>The high commanders of the various factions of the Human Sphere are trying to stop the EI from entering their systems by installing sophisticated blockades, but the Combined Army is managing to overcoming them with increasing frequency. In Third Offensive, you can read how they&rsquo;re managing to smash through the different blockades and jeopardize the human hegemony on Paradiso.<br/><br/>The real objective of the EI will be also unveiled in this book.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s in the book?<br/><br/>As already stated, a lot of new background material that develops the narrative of the Infinity Universe, and it also provides several new locations to set the stage of our favorite wargame.<br/><br/>In addition to this, two new sectorials will be added to the roster of new releases - the unyielding Invincible Army of Yu-Jing and the Varuna Intervention Division for PanOceania. These will join the new armies most recently added with Operation Coldfront (Tartary Army Corps for Ariadna, and Operations Subsection for ALEPH)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Following the British victory in the First Anglo-Sikh War (1845 &ndash; 1846) the Lahore Durbar, the Sikh Government of the Punjab, effectively came under the control of the British East India Company. In April 1848, two British officers were sent to the prosperous south western city of Multan to take over the running of the province from its governor, Diwan Mulraj Chopra. They were murdered by soldiers of the city&rsquo;s garrison, apparently acting spontaneously and without the prior knowledge of the startled Mulraj. Nonetheless, after some prevarication, he supported their actions, and thereby found himself the leader of a rebellion against the British.<br/>There were few Sikhs in that part of the Punjab: the garrison was mainly Muslim, and the Mulraj was a Hindu. Because of this, the East India Company regarded the uprising as a purely local affair and sent troops to lay siege to Multan in the expectation that this would quell the rebellion. These included a large body of Sikhs, supposedly loyal to the British, under the command of Sher Singh.<br/><br/>It is now late October 1848. Coming to sympathize with the Mulraj&rsquo;s grievances against the British and to appreciate how these are shared by the Sikhs, Sher Singh has changed sides.   His men have withdrawn from the siege and are marching north east towards the Punjabi capital, Lahore. Sher Singh&rsquo;s father, Chattar Singh, has also rebelled against the British and is besieging the fort at Attock which guards the road to Afghanistan. Inspired by the defiance of Sher Singh and Chattar Singh, anti-British disturbances have broken out in towns and cities across the western Punjab.<br/><br/>In response, units of the British East India Company are assembling at Firozpur where they will become the &ldquo;Army of the Punjab&rdquo;, under the command of Lord Gough. Gough plans to march against Sher Singh before he is reinforced by Chattar Singh. The monsoon season has ended. Campaigning can commence. So begins the Second Anglo-Sikh War 1848 &ndash; 1849.<br/><br/>Into the Lion&rsquo;s Mouth is a two-player beer-and-pretzels game which gives players the opportunity to replicate the British success in re-establishing control over the Punjab, or to re-write history by leading the Sikhs to victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The player with the most stock of a particular company in his possession acts as the president of this company and is responsible for track laying, the placement of railheads (which are necessary for train runs), route selection and train acquisition. Running trains earns money and this money is either divided by the shareholders or kept in the company's treasure for further investments (like buying better trains or constructing track). This decision influences the value of the company's shares - and not the player with the most stock or the most beautiful constructed track wins the game, but the player with the most riches in terms of cash and shares.<br/><br/>The subtitle on the box is &quot;Quickies for 1830 players&quot;. It uses mostly elements from 1830 and 1835, but introduces two new features: There is a &lsquo;purple phase&rsquo; after the &lsquo;grey phase&rsquo;, and the &lsquo;grey phase&rsquo; introduces city tiles with only one token space (tokens from the replaced brown tiles are all returned to their respective owning companies for future use).<br/><br/>All maps are playable in 2 to 4 hours, and most of them are especially tested for a 2-player game (in case of a 2-player game, the usual 60% holding limit in a company is lifted, if you buy additional shares from the bank pool).<br/><br/>",

It also includes a 5-card set of vanilla cards without effects to make it easier to introduce new players to the game.<br/><br/>In Crimson Company, two opposing players take on the roles of adventurous noblemen in a cut-throat fantasy world. In a battle of wits, they assemble armies of sellswords, from hardened warriors and shady merchants to mythical creatures as old as time.<br/><br/>Your goal in a match of Crimson Company is to conquer two of the three castles in the center. You conquer a castle by amassing more strength than your opponent in the castle's lane by the time that lane is scored. A lane is scored once a player owns at least four cards in it.<br/><br/>Cards represent a large variety of characters, all of which have specific strength values and unique effects. The latter are either one-time instant effects that happen when a card is played, or they are triggered in specific phases of the game. Four randomly drawn cards from the character deck are &quot;on offer&quot;. You may bid coins on only one of those at a time. Then your opponent decides to either pay you off, doubling the coins you bid, or pass and let you play the card.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this fantasy card game, the players play troll bandits competing for the most COINs.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player reveals as many cards ('TRAVELLERS') as there are players. Each traveller has an initiative score and will be assigned to each player - the player with the most SKULLs (see below)receives the highest priority card, and so on.<br/><br/>Each TRAVELLER either gains or costs their player coins, or introduces a new mechanic into the game. The higher the priority, the higher the rewards of a TRAVELLER card, but the higher the chance the card will be negative for the player.<br/><br/>Before each card is assigned, players can assign SKULLs to other players, themselves, or no one at all. This happens simultaneously, and after the cards to be assigned cards have been revealed. I.e. if the highest card is costing you a lot of COIN, and you have the most or are tied for the most SKULLs, you will want to give your SKULL to another player and hope you won't get any more, so the highest priority, negative TRAVELLER card doesn't go to you. On the other hand, you don't want to have much less SKULLs as anybody else, as you will constantly miss the high COIN value TRAVELLERs.<br/><br/>There is also a randomised item shop where players can spend coin for one-time or permanent rule changes (redistributing or removing SKULLs, changing priorities, lessen the impact of negative TRAVELLERs, and so on).<br/><br/>The game ends if one player starts and ends a turn with eight or more skulls, as they get to much attention to stay robbing people.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Every time the terrorist leaves a city there is the possibility he has left a bomb, trap, or recruiting cell. If Interpol does not find the bomb before it detonates, then the terrorist makes progress toward his goal of instilling fear across Europe.<br/><br/>The job of Interpol is to coordinate the efforts of Secret Agents, Bomb Squad, Special Forces, and an Informant Network to stop the terrorist from accomplishing his goal. It will take the combined special abilities of each Operative and the Informant Network for Interpol to win.<br/><br/>During the game, one player plays as the terrorist and tries to elude the operatives chasing him. With hidden movement cards, traps, bombs and recruiting cells to use, he tries to outmaneuver his opponents and stay one step ahead of them. The operatives goal is to catch the terrorist and defeat him in combat. Along the way, they want to avoid traps, defuse bombs, and defeat any recruiting cells the terrorist puts in their way. But the operatives have to be careful. If they get too spread out, the terrorist might attack and defeat them while they are isolated.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Le Bois des Coua2sous, you have a forest to cross to find lots of hazelnuts, and the first player to find five nuts wins the game.<br/><br/>On the table, you have a grid of 3x3 forest cards. The backs of each card are identical, and on the front they feature one of three images &mdash; mushroom, leaf or stone &mdash; in one of three colors: yellow, red or blue. In the twelve spaces adjacent to this grid are placed cards showing 1-3 hazelnuts.<br/><br/>A player starts: he puts his boar card before a row/column of his choice and cross it by announcing out loud what he thinks on the back of the forest card. It begins with the first card, the player announces for example &quot;leaf&quot; or &quot;yellow&quot; (according if the elements or colors are in play) then turns the card over and compares the guess to the actual picture. Initially, we discover, that the cards are random. If the guess it correct, the player continues the path to the hazelnuts that await us on the other side. If it is wrong, it stops there, and the next player start.<br/><br/>If the next player starts on the same row/column, he already knows what there is on the front of this card, unless he remembers more since it was the visible item at the beginning...!<br/><br/>Players play with colors or the elements: initially it is them who choose. But as soon as a player has reaches a nut, everyone changes: those who played on the elements switches to colors and vice versa. One must therefore be remember everything and well remember what others reveal!<br/><br/>",

You can also play them in solo (either as or against them) and even play 3-4P team games.<br/><br/>Pavl is a vicious snowman who commands the ice and snow to attack.

Legendary heroes clash across the Neververse to find out.<br/><br/>Battlecrest is a card-based tactical skirmish game for 2 players (1-4 with expansions). With perfect information, players must truly outwit their opponent to win.<br/><br/>Characters are composed of 6-card sets featuring a hero card, a health tracker, and action cards. Occasionally a minion or item will replace an action card.<br/><br/>The map is built of 6 cards as well, with the cards randomly placed in a set pattern.<br/><br/>Players take turns maneuvering their characters around the dynamic, and often dangerous map while unleashing powerful attacks. As action cards are used they open up new possibilities and empower the character&rsquo;s battlecrests. Build up to decisive strikes or refocus to get powers back. Every character has a unique set of actions and preferred tactics, so no two battles play the same.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Faun live for the hunt, the glory, to win over the respect of their own tribe. Primaevus V offers fauns challenges worthy of their abilities as hunters, which is precisely why they made it their hunting reserve.  <br/>Among the terrible creatures living on the planet, there are beasts that manage to instill fear even in the most undaunted hunters. <br/>The Primaevi call them ThunderTooths.<br/><br/>Their fur is the colour of the tempestuous blue sky, recalling the electric blue of their pulsing veins, while the bulging bones running up their spine and strong horns have snapped more than a few hunters&rsquo; blades and just as many lives. And if you happen to think that their obsidian claws and sharp fangs are the only weapons at the disposal of this terrifying beast, you&rsquo;re seriously mistaken. <br/>ThunderTooths are true to their frightening name, thanks to their unique ability to generate terrifying high voltage bolts of electricity.<br/><br/>&ldquo;According to an ancient Primaevan, an outcast Hunter once made his way to the ravine of the striking beasts, in an effort to restore his honour. The cave before him was glowing pale blue and pulsing, Krags was an expert hunter and despite being far from his tribe, would never have forgotten how to use a lance. Nothing was ever able to rattle his nerves of steel, except what he saw that day.<br/><br/>As he continued his descent into the depths of the earth, his sharp ears perceived a constant and muffled cry. And so it was that he reached an enormous grotto, where tens of fauns stood immobile like statues, with weapons in hand, all facing the same direction.<br/><br/>The cry was coming from the clamped mouths of the paralysed hunters, their eyes moving frenetically as if to warn Krags of the imminent danger. The countless trenches leading to the grotto were swarming with ThunderTooths.<br/><br/>They were babies, prey for young fauns seeking to become hunters... but where there were babies, there was bound to be a mother. A terrifying roar shook the entire cave, while from a dark tunnel the largest MotherFang Krags had ever seen emerged. Step after step, the enormous beast loomed towards him in a show of force, destroying the hunter&rsquo;s nerves, who for the first time in his life... ran.<br/><br/>While Krags ran panic-stricken, the MotherFang opened his jaws and struck the hunter with a bolt of electricity, instantly paralysing him. Krags couldn&rsquo;t move a single muscle as the ThunderTooths began making their way towards their immobile prey, drooling and famished. The fauns were perfectly conscious, but they would have preferred not to be, to avoid having to watch what was about to happen&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Content: 1 Motherfang, 5 Thundertooth, 1 Thunderthooth Pet, 4 Enemy cards, 1 Pet card, 2 Wounds cards, 10 Token, 1 Nemesis mission card, 15 Prey action cards, 1 Tile.<br/><br/>",

Any and all players may then place one of these cards face-down on the table and make one of the 5 animal sounds.  If two players are both making the same &quot;call&quot; they may choose to meet and reveal their cards.  If they were both being honest, the animals mate and each player scores 1 point.  However if one player has an animal other than the one he was representing (he was &quot;hunting&quot;), then he may eat the other player's animal and score 2 points while the other player scores 0.<br/><br/>There are two primary counters to a player who is hunting.  First, you choose whom to meet with and whom not to.  If a player has lost the trust of the other players she will have a hard time getting them to meet with him and cannot score.  Second, you can &quot;double-cross&quot; a player: if you think he is trying to eat you, play the animal that eats his animal!<br/><br/>When one player has used her last card the game is over.

In the end all cards can also be used together in the ultimate version of the game &quot;Duel der princes&quot;.<br/><br/>In the box you will find the expansions &quot;Age of Darkness&quot; and &quot; Age of Enlightenment&quot;.<br/><br/>Age of Darkness<br/>Three theme sets provide even more variety: &quot;A time of intrigue&quot;, in which the religious struggle between supporters of modern and conservative religions is central, connects to &quot;The Golden Age&quot;. &quot;A time of merchants&quot; comes chronologically before &quot;The great progress&quot; and &quot;A time of barbarians&quot; afterwards. This last theme set introduces elements from the board game expansion &quot;Cities &amp; Knights&quot;.<br/><br/>Age of Enlightenment<br/>With the three theme sets in this expansion, we continue our journey through the history of Catan. &quot;A time of discoverers&quot; takes place between &quot;The great progress&quot; and &quot;A time of barbarians&quot;. In this theme set, the residents of Catan explore the archipelago within the reach of their new ships. In &quot;A time of the wise&quot; other aspects from the time of &quot;The Great Progress&quot; are discussed. The history of Catan ends chronologically with &quot;A time of prosperity&quot;: the barbarians are defeated and the independence of Catan is assured. Time to look after the interests of the residents of Catan and to lead them to golden times.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Claim is an abstract tactical game for 2, 3, or 4 players (two teams of 2), age 12 and up.  A typical game usually last about 30 minutes.  Players take turns placing their fence pieces on the 8x8 grid.  The grid starts fenced in by neutral gray fence pieces.  The goal is to enclose a square so that you have more fence pieces surrounding it than any other player.  Once this occurs, you place your color stone on the square and then replace the surrounding fence pieces with neutral gray fences (this may now trigger scoring of adjacent squares).  The game ends when no more plays are available.  The winner is the player or team with the most stones on the board.<br/><br/>The basic grid size of the board is 8x8 squares.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle of the Yellow Breeches/Dillsburg, July 3,1863 - An Expansion module for Summer Storm: The Battle of Gettysburg.<br/><br/>The body hung limply from the roadside apple tree, as General Buford and his staff rode by. &quot;Well, gentlemen,&quot; Buford noted grimly,&quot; I guess that's one more report that General Lee will have to do without!&quot;<br/><br/>The Gettysburg Campaign remains a source of endless interest to both historian and wargamer, in part for the many ways in which small acts of fate worked to shape the course of larger events. THE DEVIL'S TO PAY explores a little known, but quite plausible, alternate chain of events turning on one such small incident.<br/><br/>Longstreet's scout Harrison ends up swinging from an apple tree, festooned with one of John Buford's famous 'let him hang for 7 days' notes. Bereft of the knowledge that the AoP is NORTH of the Potomac and hot in pursuit, General Lee simply continues as before for a few days longer, with his 3 Corps following the orders that he had already historically given them. Ewell attacks the Harrisburg defenses, which fall after a day or so. The bridges are burned, but with the shallow water and fords, the city itself is taken a couple of days later (helped by Jenkins' taking of the Rockville RR bridge to the north). However, the Pa Reserves (Crawford's Division) have been rushed north from the Washington defenses, and with their help Couch has drawn a defensive line along the Swatara Creek, a few miles to the east of Harrisburg. Early moves north from York along the Harrisburg Pike, which follows the river from York Haven. Hill, and then Longstreet follow Ewell down the Cumberland Valley (to the NE) towards the Pennsylvania capitol. By July 2nd, the Confederate Army is badly strung out; Ewell has two of his Divisions (Rodes &amp; Johnson) across the Susquehanna, with the third (Early) holding the West Shore. Hill is a couple of miles west in Mechanicsburg/Shiremanstown with Anderson's Division, while Heth and Pender's Divisions are ranged to the south holding the wide 'gap' at Dillsburg. Longstreet has two Divisions in Carlisle (Hood's &amp; McLaw's), while Pickett is still a few miles to the west guarding the ever-lengthening supply line running south to Virginia. Jenkins' coup de main has resulted in the immense Union supply base at Harrisburg being captured almost intact, and every wagon that makes it west over the shallow ford means another day of supplies for the ANVA in the fall and winter to come.<br/><br/>With the Confederates now further to the north, the AoP continues to move forward on the Gettysburg/Hanover/Manchester line it had reached by June 30th. By the evening of July 2nd, Buford's Cavalry is skirmishing with Heth's troops in the Franklintown area. Reynolds has passed Petersburg (York Springs) and is moving forward with the I &amp; XI Corps, with Sickles' III Corps and Merritt's Reserve cavalry Brigade in position to threaten the Mt. Holly Gap a few miles to the west, on the direct route between Gettysburg and Carlisle. Spurred on by the fall of Harrisburg, the rest of the Army of the Potomac is steadily marching north as well, it's concentration greatly aided by the convergence of all the main roads north at Dillsburg. The Union intelligence arm has been working overtime, and General Meade has been handed an opportunity bigger than that which faced McClellan at Frederick nearly a year before. The Confederate Army is stretched over 20 miles, from west of Carlisle to east of the Susquehanna; if he can get the Army of the Potomac through the gap at Dillsburg in force before Lee can concentrate, he will split the ANVA in two with a good chance of cutting the bulk of it off, 100 miles north of the Potomac.<br/><br/>Stuart has continued to bounce off of the right flank of the marching Union Army, and has finally followed Early over York Mountain and back into contact. Lee now knows the true danger of his position, and hurriedly orders Ewell to get his troops back across the river while the rest of the Army rushes to reinforce the troops holding the vital gap. Apprised of the situation, Couch endeavors to maintain contact, using Crawford's veteran troops to slow Ewell's withdrawal as much as possible.<br/><br/>Essentially, this scenario is very similar to the Battle of South Mountain in '62, except that the 'gap' is far wider and less defensible and the stakes, if anything, are even higher! A desperate defense/attack, coupled with wildly variable reinforcements should make for a game with quite a bit of replay value! The Union player must mount a furious attack with his arriving troops, regardless of casualties, knowing that he has a chance to strike a war-winning blow. The Confederate player must form a desperate, collapsing defense on several fronts, while trying to extricate both Ewell's troops and as many supplies as possible from his foothold on the east shore of the Susquehanna.<br/><br/>THE DEVIL'S TO PAY Contains: <br/><br/>    1 full color 22 x 34 tactical map covering the critical gap at Dillsburg, Pennsylvania. <br/>    2 identical 8 1/2 x 11 Op/Maps covering the battle area, as well as the operational area surrounding it. <br/>    1 8 - 12 page booklet detailing the scenario set-up and conditions, as well as a 'historical' article giving the background leading up to the battle. <br/><br/><br/>You must own Summer Storm: The Battle of Gettysburg to play The Devil's to Pay.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fazenda (Portuguese for Farm) is basically a card-based, bidding game with a few added elements. Players use cards to bid over Cows, Pigs, and Hens which appear in random combinations each round of play. Points are scored based on the number of animals a player has in his farm at the end of each round.<br/><br/>The strategy lies in knowing which animals will start paying off early and in capitalizing on the &quot;Haystack Cards&quot; which allow for various bonuses depending on the characteristics of your farm at the end of the 8 rounds of play.<br/><br/>Players may also plant fields which can pay off really well as long there's no drought.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Look, Sarge, No Charts:  WWII is the first offering in a new series of wargame rules that seeks to enable players to play miniature wargames without charts.<br/><br/>For the WWII rules, each stand is 1 platoon, with some sections as HQ, machine guns, or mortars represented.  The game scale is 1&quot;=50m and one turn about 15-30 minutes.<br/><br/>The standard basing is 3&quot; wide stands and depth as deep as necessary.  The authors recommend using two vehicles or guns per stand and about 12 infantry figures.<br/><br/>The game turn is divided into two phases.  In the first phase, each company, battalion and brigade HQ rolls a six-sided dice, which represents when each formation may activate.  In the second phase, a player draw cards from a deck composed of values 1-6 (with each card represented twice:  one black suit and one red suit) plus one joker, which ends the turn and causes the cards to be reshuffled.  When that card appears, all units of both sides with HQ die rolls matching the current card may act:  move, fire, conduct indirect fire, assault, etc.  There is no simultaneous action.  In the case of multiple units having the same die roll, the stands must roll for first activation.<br/><br/>Many of the chartless systems (e.g., morale) rely on the use of special dice for effect.<br/><br/>In each section of the rules there are optional rules and designers notes.<br/><br/>Yahoo Group:  <a target='_blank' href=\"http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/looksargenocharts/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://games.groups.yahoo.com/group/looksargenocharts/</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>The biggest Napoleonic game ever, for the largest Napoleonic battle<br/><br/>The battle of Leipzig was the largest battle of the Napoleonic wars and the largest battle in Europe until the First World War easily ranking as one of the largest battles in History. <br/>Leipzig is a huge battle, as the battlefield is more than 15 km wide, and a very long battle, as the events spread over 6 days between October 14th and October 19th, 1813. The French eventually gather around 190,000 men, against 350,000. It is a succession of ferocious and quite independent battles. The Allied plan, although inelegant, proved to be successful as the odds allowed them to attack everywhere and keep the advantage. Even though using the interior lines, Napoleon was rarely in a position to take a serious strategic advantage while winning almost every of these battles because a 1:2 odd can not lead to a decisive victory against determined enemies.<br/><br/>However, you are now in charge of the army, and things can turn very different...<br/><br/>&quot;Vive l&rsquo;Empereur!&quot; is a series of simulation games using a standard rules system and a set of exclusive rules specific to each battle. These particular rules include an historical commentary and the victory conditions for each scenario. <br/>The aim of this system is to refight at the regimental scale the numerous battles fought during the Napoleonic Era in Europe, between 1805 and 1815. It uses a map on which the players move counters representing the combat units involved in these battles.<br/><br/>",

A huge monstrosity held in its tomb only by the walls of the ancient cellar.  Did it come from another world, the depths of the earth or is it the Counts long forgotten father?  Either way the only thing keeping from breaking out and devouring the world is feeding  it plenty of sewer Critters.  And what unlucky fool gets this job you ask?  Why you of course!  One of the dozens of hapless servants that work under the Counts rule.<br/><br/>Feed the Beast is a simple and fast-paced dice game of gambling and luck.  Players compete against each other to fumble in the sewers for Critters and then feed the gigantic Beast in a Medieval setting.<br/><br/>On a players turn they roll dice to move, search for critters or feed the Beast. Play continues until one player manages to give the beast his fill of Critters, that player is then the winner!<br/><br/>",

Although intended to be played from the German side, Stalingrad: Heroes All plays just as well from the Soviet side. It can also be played solo, cooperatively with all players on the same side or head to head.<br/><br/>Packed with 22 linked scenarios, this book covers a variety of small-unit and medium-sized actions from lunges across the Russia steppes during Fall Blau, to short sharp fights in the rubble of the Rattenkrieg, to desperate struggles for survival during the Kessel. This book also introduces several new unit types, hero characters and morale advantages.<br/><br/>Stalingrad - Heroes All is not a stand-alone game. You must have the core rules, NUTS! - Europe 1944, to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Draconian Wars is a game of combat, resource management and battlefield tactics. The battlefield is the lands and skies of Hyperborea, an exotic continent rich in natural resources, with a wide variety of ecosystems and full of amazing and terrific creatures. <br/>During thousands of years Hyperborea has been under the uncontested control of the Draconians, but now the Technocrats have arrived to the shores of the continent and they claim what once was theirs. The control of the land is what will bring victory to one or other. The Draconian extract their magic power from the earth, consuming the live and the natural resources around them. On the other hand, the power of the Technocrats comes from carbon and steel, both equal abundant in Hyperborea.<br/>A battle for supremacy over Hyperborea has begun and one thing is clear, no matter who wins, the scares in the lands of Hyperborea will last for centuries.<br/><br/>Draconian Wars is a Non-Collectible Card Game where each player selects their deck of 50 cards in secret. Then, players take turns trying for their opponent to run out of resources. They can accomplish this by controlling as much areas of hyperborea as they can, or just crushing the opponent in battle.<br/><br/>Players have a mixture of ground and air units to spread terror across the lands of Hyperborea. Also, they have a lot of surprises that can change the fate of any battle.<br/><br/>The core set will include all you need to play, all the cards, all the challenges and all the fun you expect from a strategyc card game.<br/><br/>Future expansions will include new cards (units, actions....) new challenges and more escitement to your games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Whack &amp; Slaughter is a fantasy skirmish game, where each player uses one miniature that represents his character on the battlefield. A player may use any miniature he already possesses, as the system allows to configure the character however he wishes.<br/><br/>Similar to role playing games, before a game begins, each player has to create his Hero by buying levels in the traits defence, melee, ranged combat and magic. Depending on the choice of traits, a Hero gets access to a certain amount of skills. Currently there are 15 schools of skills available and - if a Hero uses 1 or 2 traits only - he may pick skills from up to two schools. Each school features 10 common skills as well as 5 elite skills - skills with superior effects. Only Heros having specialized in one trait receive access to elite skills.<br/><br/>The five dice a player brings along not only serve as randomizers, but as life counters and a measurement of movement as well. So each time a Hero takes damage, he will become slower and less efficient. Gameplay takes place on comparatively small &quot;maps&quot; (a term derived from video game language), forcing the Heros from the beginning into close quarter combat. A couple of scenarios are given in the rulebook, such as the classic &quot;all vs. all&quot; (also available as &quot;team vs. team&quot;), capture the flag, king of the hill, bombing run, a treasure hunt and even a snowfall scenario allowing players to duke it out in a snowball fight. Also, players are encouraged to create their own scenarios if the given ones do not suffice.<br/><br/>Also do try the companon app, allowing you to create Heros and read through the skill library, while you're on your way:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.boardnaut.studios.whackslaughtercomp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.boardnaut....</a><br/><br/>",

As a joint US&ndash;UN mission struggled to maintain order, the warlords began to unite behind Mohamed Farrah Aidid, who was to proclaim himself President of Somalia and embark upon a campaign to force the peacekeepers out of the country. Operations against Aidid and his strongholds intensified, culminating in the famous Operation Gothic Serpent, and the rescue mission to save a downed Black Hawk helicopter carried out by US Rangers and Delta Force operatives.&quot;<br/><br/>Day of the Rangers, the latest companion for Force on Force, provides wargamers with all the background, orders of battle, and scenarios they need to immerse themselves in the epic battle for Mogadishu.<br/><br/>",

He was madder than a hornet stuck in molasses.<br/><br/>So there we were looking around in the still and at first we thought it weren&rsquo;t nothing noways but then outta the corner of my eye I could see the varmint! It were grayer than the night is before a bonfire and had big blue green colored eyes like the Hatfield&rsquo;s above ground swimming pool. I swear there&rsquo;s something livin in that thing. Anyway listen here the thing were an alien surer than it were anything else.<br/><br/>We were scared but we grabbed our lead and went out for the glory. Drunk Bob tossed a cocktail at them and the thing lit up one of them like roman candle. Sonnie Boy had his potato cannon and he fired at that robot thing they had. Well the taters bounced off but some of them got stuck in its feet and sure enough them mashed taters caused it to trip over into the catfish pond.<br/><br/>We had them alien varmints on the run but they left shooting and kept trying to probe one of our cows. That&rsquo;s when we heard the sirens of them revenuers. The authorities are always trying to come and steal our shine. It makes me madder than a tick on a bull&rsquo;s rocky mountain oysters to think of them government types. Anyway if they come back we&rsquo;ll be ready for them &ndash; the aliens and the revenuers.&quot;<br/><br/>You hold in your hands the ultimate game of hilarious aliens versus hillbilly combat. It Came From Beyond the Still is a skirmish-level tabletop miniatures wargame in which two or more sides engage in mortal combat for life, liberty and the booze. So tell your kin to be prepared and to play responsibly.<br/><br/>It Came From Beyond the Still is a stand-alone game that is playable in about an hour.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crootle is an abstract game that entails matching colors. There are 112 Color Tiles in a standard deck, along with 20 Corner Tiles.  Each tile in the deck is 1.375&quot; square. Crootle uses four colors, red, green, blue, and yellow.  Each Color tile is divided into quadrants, each quadrant one of the four colors. A Color Tile may have each of its quadrants a different color, or they may be all the same, or a combination. Because there are four colors, there are 256 color combinations possible, 112 of which have been selected to make this standard deck. A Corner Tile is the same size but is solid in color. A set of Corner Tiles consists of one of each of the four colors in Crootle.<br/><br/>The object of the game of Crootle is to connect two corners of the playing field together. Each game the Corner Tiles are randomly set, and each player randomly selects their path, or rather their two corners to connect. Four players could feasibly be on the same path as each other.<br/><br/>Through timed turn play, each player draws Color Tiles and matches them side to side, trying to connect, or block their opponents from connecting, their two corners.<br/><br/>Fun for anyone who sits down to play.  Playing head to head with players of equal ability can prove to make a challenging game.  Test playing has found audiences in children 7+, adult party games, senior players, and even some autistic and other mentally challenged persons have enjoyed the task of connecting Color Tiles.<br/><br/>",

Competition for talented people is fierce, and the public's tastes in movies change all the time. The player has to manage and hire new people, and approve the right films, so that the have as much Fame (victory points) as possible, at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Created for the 2013 Solitaire Print and Play contest, Cine-vilzation uses six small containers to manage the production and payout of film genres.  Players have to do their best to predict when films will become popular, as timing a film release correctly will earn the player fame and clout in the film industry, which can help produce even more films.<br/><br/>Twelve film types are grouped into three genres centered around the resources that make Hollywood run, capital, acclaim and power.  Players keep track of these resources, using tokens, dice and cards. The tokens can only be used once, and may need to be held to pay upkeep costs at the end of each round.  Cards can be played to help pay for a film, but holding on to them will generate tokens. Dice can be used multiple times, but cost tokens each round.  Dice also control an invisible opponent, who tries to get cards before you do, and speeds up the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players will have to evaluate their supply of resources, the popularity of films, and how much time remains to try to make the best films they can.   When resources are dedicated to a film, they get placed into a container, and will be unavailable for several rounds.  The containers shift during upkeep, with any dice inside the first container getting rolled for the AI.<br/><br/>",

And the dog just wants to be left alone resting, but of course can bite, so watch out. Everyone must hurry to reach his goal before the pipes are opened and water wipes out the street.<br/><br/>During the game each side in alternating turns, moves one of his pieces (the cat or a mouse) and also the dog. The aim of the mice is to make the most of his pieces jump into the garbage can. But the cat will try to thwart this, because his goal is to devour most mice, and avoid being eaten by the dog. Both sides push the garbage can as one more piece to take advantage or thwart your opponent. Furthermore, both sides control the slow movements of the dog. This movement acts as a timer that, at mid-game, causes the disappearance of the mice that have not been put into play and the arrival of reinforcements and, on reaching the 31st turn, triggers the end game.<br/><br/>Spanish description:<br/><br/>El gato callejero se afana en atrapar a los molestos ratones.

Este movimiento se comporta como un temporizador que, a mitad de la partida, provoca la desaparici&oacute;n de los ratones que no se han puesto en juego y la llegada de nuevos refuerzos y que, al alcanzarse el turno 31, desencadena el final del juego.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Splitters! is a card driven game about the left wing political movement of the 70s. The players take on the rolls of ideologists struggling to have the movement embrace their separate interpretations of socialism. The game either ends when a player successfully achieves three secret goals or when the last card is drawn from the deck, in which case the player who controls the most party members wins.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the game the whole movement is united in the &quot;Party&quot;, but during the course of the game the players break out groups of members to form new parties. Each member tile has three opinions, each in different categories (colour, symbol and background). Playing an action card the player combines an action with on of these opinions to rearrange the members on the board - creating new parties, taking control of existing ones or transferring members from one party to another.<br/><br/>Inspired by Monthy Pythons &quot;Life of Brian&quot; Splitters! is a chaotic and humoristic game, which still leaves room for tactical depth.<br/><br/>Description in Swedish:<br/>I Splitters! tar spelarna rollen som ideologer i 70-talets v&auml;nsterr&ouml;relse f&ouml;r att utk&auml;mpa en bitter kamp om vilken tolkning av socialismen som &auml;r den r&auml;tta. Konsekvensen kan bara bli en: Splittring! K&auml;mpa f&ouml;r din &ouml;vertygelse i f&ouml;rs&ouml;ken att genomdriva ditt politiska program och samla medlemmar i en milj&ouml; d&auml;r partierna har en tendens att f&ouml;r&ouml;ka sig like am&ouml;bor - genom delning.<br/><br/>Splitters &auml;r ett kortdrivet spel d&auml;r spelarna f&ouml;rs&ouml;ker ta kontrollen &ouml;ver de medlemsbrickor som ligger p&aring; bordet. Spelet kan sluta p&aring; tv&aring; s&auml;tt - antingen genom att en spelare lyckas uppfylla tre hemliga uppdrag (s&aring; kallade &Ouml;vertygelser) eller n&auml;r det sista kortet dragits ur h&ouml;gen och segern g&aring;r till den spelare som kontrollerar flest medlemmar.<br/>Vid spelets b&ouml;rjan &auml;r alla r&ouml;relsens medlemmar samlade i &quot;Partiet&quot; mitt p&aring; bordet, men under spelets g&aring;ng bryter spelarna ut grupper av medlemmar som bildar nya partier, med allt l&auml;ngre och allt mer sekteristiska namn. <br/>Varje medlemsbricka har tre &aring;sikter i olika kategorier (f&auml;rg, symbol och bakgrund). P&aring; sin tur kombinerar spelaren ett handlingskort fr&aring;n sin hand med en av dessa &aring;sikter f&ouml;r att flytta runt medlemsbrickorna p&aring; bordet: skapa nya partier, ta &ouml;ver befintliga partier eller flytta medlemmar fr&aring;n ett parti till ett annat.<br/><br/>Inspirerat av Monthy Pythons &quot;Life of Brian&quot; &auml;r Splitters! ett kaotiskt och humoristiskt spel om 70-talets v&auml;nsterr&ouml;relse, som trots slumpfaktorer &auml;nd&aring; har taktiskt djup.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "RINKSIDE HOCKEY by FTP Sports Games is a full stats-based simulation of the fast-paced game of hockey.  The game engine is designed around a hockey player's ability to make the plays that will determine the outcome of each game.  Hockey players are rated individually on such traits as goal scoring, passing, defense, checking, and several others.  Goalies are also rated on their abilities to make saves, avoid giving up rebounds and more.  Game players will resolve action either by printing out fast action cards or using the Microsoft Excel Game Center, which is included in the game.  All player cards, the fast action deck and more are available as PDF downloads.<br/><br/>The game flows similar to an actual hockey game and is broken up into the three main zones of a rink:  Offensive Zone, Neutral Zone and Defensive Zone.  You can either pass or skate your way from one zone to the next and the fast action cards (or Game Center) will determine the result.  Once your player makes it to the offensive zone, then you decide to shoot or pass again.<br/><br/>The hockey players&rsquo; ability to draw and dish out penalties is also very evident in the game.  There is even a momentum tracker which can help teams as you track big hits, goals, great saves, etc.  <br/>Several hockey seasons are available.<br/><br/>",

We loved playing Cards Against Humanity, but felt too constrained by the predefined white cards. So we created a game where with the use of whiteboards the answer could be anything your filthy mind could think of.<br/><br/>On the surface No Blank Left Behind appears to be just another Cards Against Humanity clone with a few seemingly minor differences. First players have four statements/questions on each card to choose from. Second rather than be provided a hand of cards with a predefined responses, No Blank Left Behind instead utilizes whiteboards and dry erase markers allowing players to come up with their own responses, limited only by their individual imaginations. And lastly who wrote what answer is not kept a secrete from the judge or as it is know in No Blank Left Behind &ldquo;The Dictator&rdquo;. This allows players to lobby for their answer and explain why theirs is obviously the best.<br/><br/>What does all this mean? Well, it means you should never have to ask a lame question. You are never stuck with answer cards that don't fit the question. In-jokes or even the players themselves can become answers and the same answers can be used over and over leading to some very funny running jokes. Which in the end leads to a ton of laughs, many groans and possibly a few gasps. No Blank Left Behind may seem like another Cards Against Humanity clone, but the minor differences makes it a new unique and hilarious party game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "STORY<br/>While players are travelling around planet Earth, they need to collect enough stellar navigation knowledge (Ticket points called &lsquo;Tix&rsquo;) to face a trip to the Moon (Luna). Tix can be earned by travelling to different continents, using different vehicles and by observing the Moon, the planets (expansion) and the constellations of stars. In the endgame the Tix are essential to overcome the obstacles to the Moon. The first player reaching the Moon with sufficient Tix covering those difficulties during the trip wins the game. When playing solo, a time restriction is added to win the game depending on the difficulty level.<br/><br/>OVERVIEW MECHANICS<br/>The game board shows in the top left corner that each round, called a month, consists of three phases:<br/><br/>     Ecliptic phase: when the new first player shifts the Sun on the star map, lays out new observation cards in the observation area and initiates the first choice of the planning phase.<br/>     Planning phase: each player in counter clockwise order, starting with the first player, chooses a vacant lunar phase (1 of the 4 weeks in a month) to plan an action by placing his meeple accordingly.<br/>     Activation phase: Beginning with the first week (new moon), the planned actions are being executed. In a game with more than 4 players the direct observation takes precedent of travelling, then saving an observation card, ending with observing a saved observation card.<br/><br/><br/>The star map shows the Sun with new background stars, forming a zodiac constellation, each month of the year. A day light card will cover the constellations present during the day. This dynamic alters the visibility in horizontal fashion, according what astronomers call Right Ascension (RA). The sunset and sunrise drawn on the daylight card forms the observer&rsquo;s western and eastern horizon.<br/>A map of planet Earth shows the continents you can travel to and can result in a visibility change as an observer according to the latitude change after each movement. The latitude correlates with the highest passing of the stars overhead; called zenith. The visibility in vertical fashion is expressed in what astronomers call Declination (DEC).  Blocks underneath an armillary sphere will indicate your northern and southern horizon.<br/>The observation area contains a freshly laid out combination of observation cards that can be scored when visible according to the time of the year and the place the player is on Earth. The lunar phases are scored according to the right week of the month that they appear in.<br/>The end game unfolds once a player reaches the launch pad for a voyage to the Moon. Once launched the player must tackle certain difficulties (Diff) by keeping the Diff values under their acquired knowledge and observation points (Tix). Special abilities, hidden agendas and lunar phase abilities can mitigate the values to be absorbed by your knowledge as a navigator.<br/>The game invokes an elegant choice between efficient observation, puzzling travel routes, playing out opportunities with abilities and some courage to risk a rocket launch as soon as possible.<br/><br/>WHAT'S UNIQUE?<br/>LunaTix: Star Trackers offers a highly educational chance to get in touch with a real star map and to learn its link with our location on Earth. The knowledge of our planet&rsquo;s position and movement around the Sun, forming our seasons in time and climate regions in latitude, will provide you with a deeper insight on how people came to divide time and space as we know it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

She belongs to the Order of the Half Oracle and would always try to &quot;turn&quot; you. Dishearter will charm you first and try to convince you to follow her path... but if you reject... She would take your courage away, consume your faith and moral and leave you wretched and miserable. She is able to do that... The main rule of the Order teaches: If you are not with us, you're against us!<br/><br/>Truth-squeezer - Are you willing to tell the truth? Dare you to hide it? It's your choice, just always be prepared to meet the Truth-Squeezer ... Do you believe you're ready to face him and listen to him, hissing in your ear: Knowledge is power, but the truth could be your weakness...  I know how to squeeze it from you.... The Order will prize my efforts, since I always hear their call: Remove all obstacles!<br/><br/>Challenger - Large and very detailed miniature of a fanatics challenger, another great NPC, which offers new style of adventures... Meeting you, he will challenge you, will always try to seduce your natural born greed for success, he will play with your moral and conscience and finally he will let you no choice, but to make one very hard decision.... It's always about the same old dilemma: Victory or Defeat - and are you willing to pay the price for it?<br/><br/><br/>    NCBC is a collection of mini expansions based on neutral big scale figurines, which are designed to enlarge the immersive Battalia universe, introducing a whole bunch of new strategic possibilities to the players and adding completely new adventure elements to the basically competitive plot. In general they don't belong to any faction (resp. to any player) and can be played in different combinations with the basic game or with the BIG!Expansion. We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity. But you can mix them in totally different combinations, which ensures the long-term replaya bility and excitement in this game universe. Normally the NPCs have small complementary rules, which are provided only online on Battalia's home page battalia.eu as high resolution printable PDF files. The miniatures are distributed in small packaging boxes with custom artwork as separate items or possibly in bundles.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bomb Brigade is a tense, high-stakes game of chance where players must rely on their quick reflexes and courage to survive. There is really only one rule: don&rsquo;t blow up.<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>Connect all the Blinks together and long press one, sending them all into setup mode. In setup mode, Blinks display a slowly shifting rainbow. Arrange the Blinks into a starting arrangement, then double-click a Blink to turn it into a Bomb. All neighboring Blinks will automatically become Shields.<br/>Starting arrangements can be simple, as shown above, but can also be larger or more complicated and include multiple bombs.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>Players take turns &lsquo;sparking&rsquo; the Bomb by pressing it once. With every spark, there is an increasing chance that the Bomb will explode. In addition, each time the Bomb is sparked the spinning gets faster and faster.<br/>Sparking the Bomb<br/><br/>If you can time it correctly, you should try to only spark the Bomb when its light is facing a shield. If the bomb explodes into a Shield, that Shield takes damage.<br/>Bomb explodes, damaging Shield<br/><br/>Damage is indicated by a Shield changing color from green to yellow to orange to red. A Shield that takes 4 damage is destroyed, and displays a flashing rainbow pattern. Destroyed Shields should be removed from the board.<br/><br/>If the Bomb explodes on a side with no Shield, the player who sparked the Bomb &lsquo;blows up&rsquo; and is out of the game. Double-click the exploded Bomb to reset it.<br/>Bomb explodes on an empty side<br/><br/>WIN CONDITION:<br/>The last player remaining after all others have been blown up is the winner.<br/><br/>This game is played with Blinks, the world's first smart tabletop game system.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Monster Farm is a Drafting, Bidding, and Resource Management game.<br/>You take the role of a Monster Farmer and decide which monsters you want to feed. Then you get to bid on Monster Fruit to feed them in the Open Market. If you need more fruit, you can go to the Black Market to get more. Also, you can use a Monster Thief to steal fruit for you. All the while, Seasonal Events will cause you to adapt to new conditions on the farm. Do you have what it takes to be a Monster Farmer? (Please say yes! The monsters are really hungry and need someone to feed them.)<br/><br/>In Monster Farm there are 5 phases to the game<br/><br/>Phase 1<br/>In phase one, everyone gets 5 five Monster Cards, then you pick one and pass the others. Each Monster Card has the fruit required to feed it listed below. Overall, the more points a monster is worth the harder it will be to feed it. You keep doing this until you have drafted your farm. In this stage, you might be trying to draft easy monsters to speed up the game and get a blitz win.  Or maybe you go with a few big, harder monsters hoping that if you feed just a few big guys, you can pull it off.   Or maybe you do a balanced draft. It is all up to you and the monsters you draft will affect the way you play the rest of the game.<br/><br/>Draft 5 monsters for your farm!<br/><br/>Phase 2<br/>In phase two, a Seasonal Event happens; this will cause all farmers to adjust their strategy. It could be gaining a monster, losing a monster, or maybe gaining some random fruit and more. Things will change and affect your strategy. However, this is an environmental change and it affects everyone. It is not just one player becoming lucky or unlucky.<br/><br/>Phase 3<br/>In phase three, there is an Open Market bid.   You are bidding on a bundle of three fruits. Each player bids on the market starting with the first player for that round.  Each player must bid higher or pass.  If you pass you are out of the bidding round. This becomes quite tricky. Maybe you really need only one fruit or you may need all the fruit.  How much should you bid?  It could also be that you don&rsquo;t need the fruit but you buy it so that you can prevent someone else who does need it from buying it.  Do you bid it up and hope you don&rsquo;t get left with it? A lot can happen here. There are various fruits, some will help you feed you monsters others will give you a permanent income bonus.  At the bottom right of each card, you can see how many of those there are in the deck.<br/><br/>Also once per game, you can play a Monster Thief to steal the bid! It is like a tactical nuke. You only get to use it once during the game so play it wisely.<br/><br/>Phase 4<br/>In phase four, you are buying fruit on the Black Market.   The fruit is random and you can even get a rotten fruit which is completely useless. Since it is the Black Market, there is no quality control.  Remember the Monster Gems you spend here means that you will have less when you go to bid on the Open Market.<br/><br/>Phase 5<br/>In phase five, you collect your base income of 3.  If you have purchased Fruit Stands or Monster Cafes from the Open Market or Black Market, your income is increased.   For each Fruit Stand, you will receive an additional 1 Monster Gem added to your income.   For each Monster Cafe, you will receive an additional 2 gems during this phase.   You keep these cards until the end of the game.<br/><br/>Winning the Game<br/>Repeat phases 2 thru 5 until someone has fed all of their monsters. The first person to feed all their monsters receives a Monster Egg for an additional five points.  All other players finish playing the rest of that round.   Then each player adds up the points on their fed monsters and the one with most points wins and is now the &ldquo;Master Monster Farmer!&rdquo;<br/><br/>In Monster Farm, you get an amazing 2 to 6 player game that the whole family can play in about 30 minutes. I have been playing board games for quite some time but often much of my games go unplayed because they just don&rsquo;t fit the number of players, or they take too long, or they just don&rsquo;t fit the ages/abilities of the players. I wanted to make sure that the game would be fun for both adults and kids. I wanted it simple but yet have a good depth of strategy.   Also, I wanted a game where you don&rsquo;t just play for 5 minutes then wait 15 minutes until it is your turn again.   This game passes the Smore Games QualityTest, which is, after people play the game once, they want to play it &ldquo;Smore!&rdquo;   I want to thank all my playtesters and the feedback they have given.  This is an OUTSTANDING GAME!  Have fun!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome! is a card game from Japan. Players are trying to be the most successful mayor, attracting new businesses to their town, or lose the next election! The game turns on being able to build up a company and also be the only player appealing to that company. Players do this by card drafting and bluffing, openly or blindly, until a final reckoning.<br/><br/>The game has a simple deck of 80 cards and a start player marker. Played over two rounds, each round has four turns, and players take simple actions to improve their chances of re-election.<br/><br/>The deck has 8 Tourist cards (orange), 12 Software (yellow), 12 Hotel (purple), 12 Merchant Ship (green), 16 Airlines (blue) and 20 Motors (red). Each card shows the number in the deck, so all the orange Tourist cards say 8. With three players, the yellow cards are not used.<br/><br/>On the back of each card is a handshake. Players are trying to convert company cards they collect into handshakes. Most handshakes collected by the end is the winner.<br/><br/>The deck is shuffled, a line of 5 cards is dealt up, the companies players are trying to attract. Players are dealt 9 cards each, and each selects 3 to pass to their neighbour once. The neighbour looks at them, and the passed cards then go into a deck shuffled up. This Round deck goes next to the line of companies.<br/><br/>Now players choose two hand cards in secret and place them face-down. When everyone has chosen, these Appeal cards are turned face up. At the end of the round, after four turns, these Appeal cards will divide up the company cards evenly between players, turning them over into handshakes. So the players are trying to place Appeals such that they are the only mayor attracting that company at the end of the round. If more than one player has the same Appeal card out, the cards are divied up by proportion.<br/><br/>During the round, players may add one only Appeal card (limit is 3), or make swap a new Appeal card in (face-up or face-down) sending the old card to the company line, or may turn one card horizontal as a Challenge. Once each player has taken one action, three cards are dealt up from the Round deck to the line. If a player had chosen a Challenge to match any of these, their Challenge card becomes a handshake for them. If it didn't, it is discarded from the game. The start marker moves on and play continues with another action.<br/><br/>After four turns, all Appeal cards are shown, and the line of companies is divied up. Collected cards become handshakes, uncollected remain for the second round, with the Appeal cards being added to the company line.<br/><br/>The second round is played over in the same way and the player with the most handshakes at the end is the winner.<br/><br/>The first edition was home-made by the designer in only five copies. The second edition was a full edition and the 3rd edition was only a straight reprint, although marked in the rules as a 3rd edition.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

Relive an ancient tale and lead your people home before they&rsquo;re lost to the blizzard. 12 maps are included, with millions more to discover.<br/><br/>The goal is to lead 3 of your pieces home before your rival. Players take turns sliding 1 of their pieces across the board. There are no captures or jumps, but players' pieces will keep sliding on open tiles if they move in a direction until they would run into something. When you lead a piece home, that's one less piece on the board to block your rival. Every piece on the board may help or halt your progress.<br/><br/>While Nersha has several board layouts that ship with the game, players can decide to change the board or the number of pieces to play with, among other aspects. There are also seven different tile types that can add more complexity to mapmaking.<br/><br/>This game is designed to bridge between casual or abstract games you learn as a kid with daunting games like chess, bringing together all playstyles.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Big washes, little washes is a game about washing clothes carefully. The right washing powder, the right temperature and the right speed. That is not easy because you can influence only one of those three factors, the others are determined by your opponents. On your turn, you determine one of those factors (i.e. washing powder) and play a card ( a piece of clothing). The others decide to join in (play a card) or pass. Then the next player determines another factor (i.e. temperature) and playes a card. Then, if also the spin cycle is determined the cards are turned and scored.<br/><br/>In Big washes, little washes you play 1 of 11 characters, each of which gives a different game experience. In addition, it has an expert mode where you can use your clothing cards in multiple ways and a solo campaign where you play all 11 characters, each with their own goal.<br/><br/>If you succeed, they can go clean in your wardrobe and you will receive your honestly earned points. But if your wardrobe is full, you have to make space by selling sets or outfits. Of course you also score points with that.<br/><br/>The game ends when the first player reaches 75 points. After that everybody can sell remaning sets/outfits from their wardrobe and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Grote wasjes, kleine wasjes is een spel over het zorgvuldig wassen van kleren. Het juiste waspoeder, de juiste temperatuur en het juiste toerental. Dat valt niet mee omdat je zelf maar &eacute;&eacute;n van die drie factoren kunt be&iuml;nvloeden, de andere worden bepaald door je tegenspelers. In je beurt bepaal je een factor (bijvoorbeeld temperatuur) en speel je een kledingkaart. De andere besluiten mee te doen (door ook een kledingkaart te spelen) of te passen. Daarna bepaalt de volgende speler de temperatuur, speelt een kaart en de andere besluiten weer of ze nog meedoen. Als ook het toerental is bepaald draaien we de kaarten om en scoren we het resultaat. Als het lukt mogen ze schoon in je klerenkast en krijg je je eerlijk verdiende punten. Maar als je klerenkast vol is (er kunnen 8 stuks in je kast) dan moet je ruimte maken door sets of outfits te verkopen. Bijvoorbeeld een set van 5 paar sokken of 3 overhemden. Natuurlijk scoor je daar ook weer punten mee. Veel punten zelfs als het je lukt om bijvoorbeeld een complete zwarte of vintage outfit te verzamelen.<br/><br/>In Grote wasjes, kleine wasjes speel je 1 van de 11 karakters die elk weer een andere spelervaring geven. Bovendien heeft het een expert-modus waarbij je je kledingkaarten op meerdere manieren kunt benutten.<br/><br/>Het spel eindigt als de eerste speler 75 punten bereikt. Hierna mogen alle spelers nog sets/outfits uit hun kledingkast verkopen en de speler met de meeste punten wint.<br/><br/>Ten slotte is er solo-campagne waarbij je alle 11 karakters speelt die ieder hun eigen doel hebben.<br/><br/>",

By getting 1 card and playing 1 card each turn, both players assembles teams of creatures on the table in front of them.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they normally draw 1 card from the common pile and play 1 card by putting it into their team - their respective side of the battlefield.<br/><br/>Most of the cards in the draw pile are creatures that can be played to perform various actions. But some cards are Totems and follow a slightly different set of rules: If a played Totem in interrupted with a Spooky Skelly, that Totem immediately switches teams! Totems are also &quot;indestructible&quot; - if you attack an opponent's Totem, move it into your own team instead of discarding it.<br/><br/>The first player to have three Totems (and no Spooky Skellies) in their team wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Uncle Howard has left us for good. An inveterate beatnik, he lived life to the fullest. Throughout his life, he visited many countries around the world and always brought back incredible memories and stories of his adventures. In his will, Uncle Howard was amused to propose that his heir nephews and nieces divide his estate between them through a game.<br/><br/>In This Is Mine! each player represents one of Uncle Howard's heirs, who receives parts of the inheritance to be divided among all. As the uncle lived with great artists, many of these objects belonged to famous musicians, poets and writers of his time, all very precious!<br/><br/>In each round, the starting player divides the revealed cards from the deck into lots. Each lot must contain at least one card, but the player can split it however they see fit. Then the starting player chooses one of the lots, placing his marker on it: &quot;This is Mine!&quot;. Each of the other players must either agree or disagree. To disagree, a player must exchange the marker on the lot for his own and value one of the other available lots, adding money to it. When everyone accepts that the lot belongs to one of the players, a new round of claims begins, with one of the remaining players choosing one of the remaining lots.<br/><br/>Inheritance Cards bring different types of items, and each type of item has a set-collection scoring. At the end of the game, the player with the most valuable inheritance wins. So, players must pay attention when dividing and try to gather the best collection of items.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each of you has their own ship, that needs a competent crew armed to the teeth, lots of canons, ammunition, and provisions to thrive navigating the seas, conquering outposts, fighting sea monsters and plunder valuable goods. Tell your tales over a bottle of rum and impress your fellow pirates. Who will have the best tales to tell?!<br/><br/>In Nassau each player represents a pirate crew trying to earn the most points during the course of the game. Nassau is played over 4 seasons with each season broken down into 2 phases.<br/><br/>In the first phase players collect different items like: weapons, pirate pets, coins, rum, sails, and other stuff on the city game board to make their own ship stronger a prepare them for the second phase. You get those items by placing your pirates through a clever placement mechanism in the city of Nassau, that leaves enough room for tactical decisions.<br/><br/>In the second phase it is time to test how good your crew and ship really is by sailing the seas and take on different adventures. Each action costs you a provision and depending on where you sail and what you do, you need weapons, canons, and ammunition. But beware, each weapon and canon must be manned by a pirate, so keep your balance. Pirate pets allow you to use special powers that can turn the tide of battle. At last, you must return to your home base, but not without telling tales of your adventures and earning points. The better the tale, the more points await.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Totally Not T9 is a set of two low-luck trick-taking games. Both games are nominally postal themed.<br/><br/>The first game, called Totally Not T9, is played over two rounds (or three rounds with the optional variant). Players draft their cards each round. As the trick play occurs, the deck will deplete, so there will be 11 tricks in the first round, but only 6 in the second round. Players gain cards into their score piles along the way, with the highest card taking the lowest card in the trick, and the lowest card taking the highest. At the end of the game, the player getting the closest to or reaching 40 points without going over 40 wins.<br/><br/>The second game, Stamp Out Bootleggers, is a one-hand trick taking game. The illegal speakeasies don&rsquo;t want any particular letters (i.e. cards) traced back to them, so no player owns their hand of cards. On their turn, a player will play a card from any of the four hands of cards on the table. Each hand can only be played once into each trick. Players gain cards into their score piles for winning tricks, with each card being worth its face value in points. The player getting the closest to or reaching 40 points at the end of the game without going over 40 wins. But before final scoring, the postal inspectors (one suit) will make arrests of the bootleggers (the other three suits). For better or worse, this will keep those cards from counting towards a player&rsquo;s score.<br/><br/>The name of the set is a joke. T9 was a 35 person trick-taking game played by mail; it was created for the T9 event. This was also created, in part, for the T9 event, but the name was already taken by the postal game, so this is called Totally Not T9.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Controlling the French side as the Emperor Napoleon, you have conducted a brilliant campaign so far against not one, but two, Allied armies, defeating Field Marshal Blucher&rsquo;s Prussians at Ligny and forcing the Anglo-Allied army under the Duke of Wellington to retreat from Quatre Bras. You have sent a wing of your army under Marshal Grouchy to keep the Prussians and the British-Dutch armies separate. Meanwhile, Wellington and his Dutch allies with 68,000 men have fallen back to a ridge line before the small town of Waterloo. On this rainy and muddy day, your 72,000-strong French army must defeat the Anglo-Allied Army before the Prussians can regroup, avoid Grouchy, and arrive on the battlefield at Waterloo. Are you up for the challenge?<br/><br/>Vive L&rsquo;Empereur is a hex-and-counter war game that uses a chit-pull system to generate random force activations for both sides. The Anglo-Allied and Prussian forces (the forces of the solitaire side) move and conduct combat using random instructions from the game&rsquo;s Activation Table.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

The sinews that kept the empire together were the ships of the Royal Navy, and later, those of the Commonwealth nations. Today, just like it was in the past, whenever those ships sail, one can see the White Ensign.<br/><br/>White Ensign discusses each conflict in which Commonwealth naval forces were involved from 1960 to the present day. These include: Yemen 1960-67, Borneo 1962-66, Rhodesia 1965-66, Iceland 1972-73, Falklands 1977, Desert Shield/Storm 1990-91, Kuwait 1961 (Operation Vantage), East Africa 1966, Suez 1966-73, Cyprus 1974, Falklands 1982, Adriatic 1993-96.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most comprehensive study of the modern Royal Navy outside of official publications and a valuable reference book in its own right, White Ensign is meant to be used as a supplement to Harpoon4 and requires the use of Harpoon4 rules to derive the maximum value from it. All ships, from carriers down to patrol/fast attack craft, as well as ships taken up from trade (STUFT) during the Falklands War are included in the ship data annex, as are all aircraft that were or could have been used in a naval environment. Also included is an extensive bibliography which includes official sources and internet sites.<br/><br/>",

Mission Directors compete to construct all the modules necessary to start a Mars settlement, sourcing as many parts internally as possible to maximize profitability.<br/><br/>During game play, players will use their deck and tableau set up to add cards to the middle of the table. Players can start a new module or add to an existing module. All modules in the middle of the table are public and can be started or added to by anyone at anytime. Players are playing simultaneously so don't wait to play your cards or another player will beat you to it! When a unit is completed, it is added to a player's colony, waiting to be scored at the end of the round...that is.....if you were not sabotaged!<br/><br/>Mars 04:45 can be played by as many people as there are unique decks, 4-6 players works best. Mars 04:45 has a play time of 15-20 minutes. First player to 150 points wins the game and play can be adjusted depending on how many points the group sets as the goal.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Inside the Crease (ITC) hockey is a tabletop simulation of the fast-paced game of pro hockey.  In keeping with the pace of the sport of hockey this game uses double-sided Fast Action Cards (FAC) to move the game right along.<br/><br/>From the first face off players will perform on the ice like no other simulation out there.  Skater&rsquo;s cards are broken down with four separate offensive columns based on whether your team is at even strength, in the power play, shorthanded or the column for rebounds and great feed passes.  These cards don&rsquo;t just tell you whether a player takes a shot but the quality of the shot as well.  Some guys will be shooting at the twine with quality shots most of the time while others will just be putting the puck towards the net.  The slick-passing skaters are not left out here as a good play maker on the ice can set up much higher shooting opportunities.   Players are also rated on the frequency of giving away the puck.  In ITC a bone-headed pass that loses the puck isn&rsquo;t just a turnover it can be a chance for a breakaway for the opposition.<br/><br/>Defense is covered equally in depth with four separate defensive ratings to set players apart.  The ability to takeaway the puck, block shots, check players off the puck and a general defensive ability all can force the action of the offense.  You will be able to &ldquo;see&rdquo; a great defensive play stop a would be shot.  Blocking a shot or forcing a shot wide with a defensive stop can be a goal saver.  Controlling loose pucks can be a real game turner in ITC with this ability captured in the ratings as well.<br/><br/>No hockey game would be complete without the ability to capture the penalty aspect.  In ITC the players are not just rated for penalty frequency but the type as well.  Whether it be a minor, major or misconduct you will know when it happens.  If a fight breaks out you will watch the two combatants head to the box.  When a minor is called you will get an actual penalty name (elbowing, holding, etc) for added flavor.<br/><br/>The goalies are created with the ability to stop shots in the six different shooting categories.  You will be crushed to watch a weak slapshot trickle through for a goal but be ecstatic watching your goalie thwart an excellent scoring opportunity.  In ITC the  ability of the goalie to control the action after a shot is also taken into consideration.  You will see your goalie simply give up a rebound shot, hold the puck or be able to pass it off to a teammate.<br/><br/>If strategy is your game ITC delivers with a simple and unobtrusive way to handle your coaching choices.  If you push more forecheckers up the ice for better scoring chances you are leaving yourself open on the back end.  It is your choice how to play it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Commando 4 en action: Dieppe 1942&quot; is a solitaire tactical wargame appearing in the French Vae Victis magazine #131 (special game edition).<br/><br/>It simulates the British commandos raid under Lord Lovat's command (Operation Cauldron) to destroy a powerful German battery (code name Hess) near Varengeville (in Normandy) during the famous August 19th 1942 Dieppe operation. During this operation, the British landed by Landing Craft Assault (LCA) on Orange I &amp; II, were ordered to destroy the six 155mm guns battery, capture German soldiers, cut telephone wire and finally embark all in the waiting LCA.<br/><br/>The game is edited under ziplock and contains an A3-size map depicting Varengeville (close to Dieppe) surroundings (scale at 1/25000), 108 counters (the 2 formation of British commandos lead by lieutenant colonel Lovat and Mills-Robert ; German coastal defense, Luftwaffe guards, MGs, Flak, mines, wires, pill-boxes and part of 571th infantry regiment reinforcements ; activation and other markers). One typical counter unit represents around 10 men. The rules are included in a separate 16 pages A5-sized booklet. Very easy to learn and fun to play !<br/><br/>The duration of the game is 12 turns from 4:45 to 07:30 am. The player plays the British side first each turn and then the activated german units fight, move and get reinforcements in this respective order. Except for the coastal defenses, the German units are not represented on the map at the beginning. Instead, several randomly selected activation markers are deployed in specific areas of the map. The combination of proximity to British units and alert level may trigger an activation marker that may hide 0 to 4 German units. These activated units may then fight and move. German move is dictated by closest (in PM) and largest enemy stack or German stack. Combat - Fire and/or Assault -  is resolved by comparing the strength of both adjacent stacks modified by the presence of an officer, the terrain modifier and 1D6 for the British and 1D10 for the Germans. Largest score inflicts one step loss to the other. Sniper and mortar section are represented with special effects on the game.<br/>The British must score at least 10 victory points to get a marginal victory. More than 20 is a decisive victory. The historical score is 24 VP.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Benediction is a combinatorial abstract strategy game for two players. The game is played on the points of a tri-gridded hexagonal board, with flippable checkers and stones. The objective of the game is to capture one enemy king, or bless one friendly king.<br/><br/>Players begin with a king on their starting point in opposite corners of the hex grid. Players fill their zone, which includes all points adjacent to the starting point, with men. Men are defined as a checker or stack of checkers. By default, men start with a stack size of 1 checker. Men move in any direction in a straight line, distance up to size of the moving stack or sub-stack. Stacks jump occupied points, but may not move onto or jump over blocks. Captures happen by replacement (like in chess). Capturing does not depend on stack size (small stacks can capture large stacks, and vice versa). New men can be created by merging and splitting stacks (which are defined below). By default, men are limited to making stacks no higher than two checkers high. To create stacks taller than two checkers high, at least one of them must be blessed, by interacting with enemy walls.<br/><br/>The main mechanisms of Benediction are blessings, curses and kings. Blessed men can merge once with any friendly man. Points on enemy walls, which have the power to bless men, are adjacent to the opposite end of the board via each line of the grid (like a portal). Movement across enemy walls results in teleportation of pieces across the board via forward and diagonal-forward movement. If a man moves past enemy walls, he is blessed. If you connect your wall to the enemy wall with a connected chain of friendly men, they all become blessed, except those that are cursed. Cursed men, which become cursed when stacks split apart, cannot be blessed and can only merge with blessed men. Finally, players have kings. Men that land on any starting point, or that merge with a king, automatically become kings. Because kings cannot merge with kings, and kings cannot get cursed, the number of kings can increase until a player is no longer able to defend them all.<br/><br/>Players alternate turns of two actions per turn (12* protocol). The five possible actions include: Move, Drop, Block, Merge, Split. These actions are defined as follows: <br/><br/>     Move = Move man to an empty point (or capture). He can't move again this turn, but he can merge or split. If he moves past enemy walls, bless him.<br/>     Merge = Move man or sub-stack onto a reachable friendly man. If a man is moving through enemy walls in the process of merging, bless him. Before completing the merge, remove any blessings/curses on the pieces involved.<br/>     Split = Move sub-stack to empty point (or capture). Curse both resulting stacks. If the sub-stack moves past enemy walls, bless that sub-stack instead.<br/>     Drop = Drop a new man on an empty point in your zone. He can't move this turn, but he can merge.<br/>     Block = Put black stone on an empty point. Blocks cannot be placed on adjacent points or on opposite ends of the same grid-lines. Men can&rsquo;t jump / move onto blocks.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Load up with as much as you can carry and run head first into the dungeon, exploring rooms and revealing monsters, all while keeping track of hidden treasures and swords!<br/><br/>During play, you must efficiently play the 5 cards in your hand for any combination of movement, strength, or energy. Movement advances you deeper into the dungeon allowing you to peek at or reveal the cards along the way. Monsters you find can only be defeated with strength. New items (and swords!) are acquired by spending cards in your hand for energy. Many items have effects that will further expand your tactical options as your deck grows.<br/><br/>As you defeat monsters and pick up loot, do your best to remember where everything is hidden. Treasures and slain monsters are worth gold, so get collecting! Once the dungeon has been thoroughly ransacked, or the boss is defeated, whoever has the most gold wins!<br/><br/>You can use Dungeon Builder Sets to spice up your dungeon. Each set contains 15 cards (including a new Boss) that can be slapped onto a standalone dungeon to lengthen your game and add new challenges and puzzles to solve! The Gardenin Elm's Dungeon Builder Set features a unique take on card vaporization. It has an interesting variety of new monsters, items, and obstacles.<br/><br/>",

The weapons wielded to combat the undead corrupt their users just as foully as necromancy corrupts its practitioners, and each qualified candidate was unwilling to give up his humanity for the Guild. That is, until a woman stepped forward and volunteered for the command. Her true name remains as much a mystery to the Guardsmen outside of the Death Marshals as the source of her blindness. Whatever took her sight, the rumor goes, blessed her with supernatural senses and also granted her the ability to resist the necromantic influences that slowly corrupt every other member of the Death Marshals Department. Lady Justice is tireless in her hunt for Resurrectionists in the City. She and her Death Marshals are called on the scene when evidence of necromantic rituals, or some chance encounter with the undead, have exhausted the Guild Guard's resources. Once on the trail of a Resurrectionist, Justice does not tire and does not give up until her suspect is in her custody, or is no longer able to pose a threat to the residents of Malifaux.<br/><br/>",

Battles are fought out over a small hex grid, with terrain overlaid terrain tiles and single-hex unit counters. Size of armies is usually around 10-12 units. There are no dice involved in combat resolution, so the battle is decided entirely by the tactical skill of the players in deploying and maneuvering their units (thus the likeness to Chess).<br/><br/>Phalanx was published in issue 165 of Slingshot, the Society of Ancients journal (back issues on CD are available to members).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>TOKTONG PASS&mdash;ESCAPE FROM CHOSIN is a detailed new ATS system game that tells the story of the Korean War from the perspective of the men of the 1st Marine Division, retreating from the Chosin Reservoir in the face of a massive onslaught by Chinese Communist troops. The Marines knew there was only one way out from Chosin, and that was to fight their way out, outnumbered and amidst some of the most hostile terrain on earth&mdash;harsh, hilly and frozen. The Marines could only bring their superior elan and small arms to bear against an enemy determined to annihilate every American soldier north of the 38th Parallel. Frostbite was an indiscriminate enemy while every hilltop captured by the Chinese had to be re-taken, every breach in the Marine perimeter repaired by force, without delay.<br/><br/>TOKTONG PASS&mdash;ESCAPE FROM CHOSIN delivers unheralded action and suspense at the scale and level of detail true tactical-level enthusiasts demand&mdash;individual squads, weapons and tanks. All the subtle nuances of small unit actions are provided by the acclaimed ATS system: gun duels; separate pivoting turrets; AFV indirect fire; coaxial machine-guns; melee; smoke; armor penetration; morale; AFV overruns; and much more. And it is all accomplished using a detailed yet intuitive system that models tanks using discrete armor values at turret, superstructure, lower hull and track aspects and front, side and rear facings. The ATS system provides for the realistic use of High Explosive and Armor Piercing ammunition. All this without the need for side notes or plotting moves and in a solitaire-friendly presentation.<br/><br/>BEGIN PLAY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY using the provided BASIC GAME RULES and TRAINING MAPSHEET that take moments to read and allows you to get your units down on the game map within minutes.<br/><br/>IN EACH GAME YOU GET:<br/><br/>* A complete collection of color die-cut counters in 1/2&rdquo;, 5/8&rdquo; and 3/4&rdquo; sizes, representing the tanks, guns, and infantry that fought in the Korean War.<br/>      providing the tanks, guns, and men that fought in the battle depicted;<br/>    * A two part game box<br/>    * A colorful and accurate game map on heavyweight stock.<br/>    * The latest edition of the ATS rules of play;<br/>    * Scenarios and Play Aids printed on separate heavyweight cards;<br/>    * Two ten-sided dice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was initially intended to be an expansion to Avalon Hill's Caesar's Legions. It has turned into much more than that. It has so many distinct features to it, the only recognizable part that remains are the counters. Caesar's Legions was a captivating game and pretty successful for Avalon Hill. It broke the mold of their traditional WWII games and the traditional combat chart that they used. There were two short comings with the game - there were only five scenarios, and there was no campaign game.<br/><br/>Caesar in Gaul covers a much shorter time period, which makes a campaign game more adaptable. At present it has nine historical scenarios. The rules are more complex as is the combat system, but it remains an intermediate level game, and is highly suited for solitaire play. It has become the sequel game that Caesar's Legions players have always wanted.<br/><br/>The second Edition rules are released and address all of the criticisms presented to date. They are a free download PDF as well as other charts used in the game.<br/><br/>A computer game for the 4th scenario - Crassus in Aquitania is also available. It gives players a feel for the game mechanics. Useful to play before diving into the scenarios or campaign game.<br/><br/>Some players have mentioned their hesitance to purchase a board game with a lot of cards in it. The 78 tribal cards are for player reference. It makes locating the various tribes on the board easier, gets you more familiar with the strange tribal names, and instantly identifies resources and leaders available for that tribe. Also useful for random selections when called for, and organizing initial tribal morale in the campaign game set up.<br/><br/>",

Seize the most valuable vessels you can, embark on lucrative campaigns, and prey upon the ships of your fellow rogues &mdash; but beware the Black Spot, for danger lurks within! You'll find hurricanes, mutiny and vile curses, and there&rsquo;s not a soul to be trusted. Alliances will rise and fall as you seek to build your fortune.

Working from a hand of randomly drawn cards, you capture ships by matching sets of cards of the same type, and by placing those ships &ldquo;in play&rdquo; on the table. Ships are made up of valuable Loot cards that provide you with gold, and powerful Attack cards that help you defend it. Balancing the two is a key strategy in the game. For once in play, ships can be used to attack and capture ships belonging to other players.<br/><br/>Action cards aid you in this endeavor, and Campaign cards give you extra objectives to achieve along the way. Event cards round out the deck, providing dangerous obstacles to overcome. The game ends when one player has at least 12 cards on the table (across all their ships), and can discard their last card. The winner is the player with the most loot!<br/><br/>",

Darkthony and his minions are on a frantic search for the seven powerful mega-crystals that will allow them to dominate the Bat Archipelago. Can we complete our quest and use our magical powers to save Blue Hat from the hands of Darkthony? He must be stopped!<br/><br/>Alchemical Crystal Quest is a cooperative fantasy board game featuring a campaign of ten missions. Players win the game if they complete all the missions&mdash;each of which is a chapter in their quest. Players take the roles of alchemist magician apprentices on an adventure to discover the complete history of the Bat Archipelago and to save their alchemy teacher from the hands of the evil sorcerer Darkthony.<br/> During the game, wizards search for keys, acquire magical artifacts, and spend crystals to upgrade their weapons. Wizards can change their size, ride magical pets, and engage in dice-rolling battles using weapon cards and spell cards. In some chapters, wizards will move onto special aerial tiles as they fly to the sky for flight-fight missions. Players create spells using combinations of colored crystals to equip their wizards with special abilities and magic attacks to fight their enemies.<br/><br/>If you succeed in completing all the chapters of your Quest and rescue Blue Hat, you will win the game!<br/><br/>Alchemical Crystal Quest features cartoon-style character miniatures for wizards, enemies, and magical pets. This game is for 1 to 4 players, and playtime is 40 to 120 minutes, depending on the mission.<br/><br/>",

The despot captain Piper is the worst of the lot; unleashing haunting melodies that permeate through the pitch - compelling not only his own team into the fray, but luring the enemy to dance to his jig.<br/><br/>Offering an exciting new method of board control, coaches of the Ratcatcher&rsquo;s will spread disease and poison throughout the opposition. Sapping their strength and will to resist, the influence of the Piper spreads across the pitch like a plague until eventually everyone&rsquo;s dancing to the master&rsquo;s tune. The Ratcatcher&rsquo;s are a formidable threat on any pitch they scurry onto, perfect for the coach who enjoys toying with their opponents before springing the final trap.<br/><br/>Neglected and shunned no longer, the time has come to pay the Piper - this set includes a ball, 6 player cards, bases, 3D terrain piece, goalpost and 6 players: Piper, Squeak, Miasma, Pelage, Skulk, Scourge.<br/><br/>-- Description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Covering Nurgle teams, with a veritable host of brand-new content for Blood Bowl, this is sure to be a must-have for Chaos coaches... Contained in the 36-page journal:<br/><br/>- Papa Nurgle&rsquo;s Favoured Players: details and background on those teams dedicated to Nurgle, the most bizarrely cheerful of the Chaos gods. You&rsquo;ll learn how they play, how they look and how they gleefully spread their rot and filth all over the pitch, with a focus on The Diseased Destroyers, Bile-City Blightkings, The Subterranean Slimeballs, and The Plaguebearers;<br/>- Chat With the Rat: ace Skaven reporter Hackspit &lsquo;the Scribbler&rsquo; Quillchewer talks with Bilerot Vomitflesh about being a follower of Nurgle, and asks: just where is the Garden of Nurgle?;<br/>- Star Player Spotlight: &ndash; a detailed profile of Bilerot Vomitflesh, who can play for Nurgle and Chaos Chosen teams. Includes his in-game cost, stats and skills, and career &lsquo;highlights&rsquo;;<br/>- Dirt From the Dugout: Spike! Journal interviews gossip columnist Mindy Piewhistle about the rivalry between the Dark Gods, and learns maybe a little more than they&rsquo;d like about some insidious locker room shenanigans;<br/>- Nurgle Playbook: an Introduction to coaching Nurgle teams, including an overview of the strengths of their team, advice on tactics, set-ups, and examples of the skills you can give to different positions;<br/>- Star Player Spotlight: a grisly profile of Bulla Shardhorn, a pox-ridden beast who can play for Chaos Renegade, and Nurgle teams. Includes his in-game cost, stats and skills, and career highlights;<br/>- Star Player Spotlight: a profile of Tolly Glocklinger, a former circus strongman (which is excellent) who can play for Nurgle teams. Includes his in-game cost, stats and skills, and career highlights;<br/>- The Glittering Prizes: an overview of the recent history of Blood Bowl taking a closer look at many of the minor leagues and tournaments that have sprung up after the collapse of the NAF, becoming regular fixtures;<br/>- Sideline Assistance: a trio of rotten new inducements for Nurgle, Chaos Chosen, and Chaos Renegade Blood Bowl teams. Plague Doctors, Cavorting Nurglings and Horticulturalists of Nurgle are available &ndash; none of them do anything especially pleasant&hellip;;<br/>- Mighty Blow!: tales of sporting glory from the career of all-time Star Player Bob Bifford, presented as an all-new comic strip drawn by the legendary Blood Bowl illustrator Pete Knifton, and written by official Spike!

The fire dragons are sleeping. The giants of winter, lurking. The fall is precious and is vital to plan your actions wisely.<br/><br/>Dwar7s Fall is a game about collecting gems in order to trade it for food. In the meantime you also will need to build your dwarf kingdom and slay some monsters. In this game you have multiple paths to win by choosing carefully your actions.<br/><br/>Players take turns to perform their actions. Each turn you can do 3 actions (place a realm tile or place one dwarf in a tile or move one dwarf by one tile).<br/><br/>Each tile has a pre-requisite of how many dwarfs of one player are needed to perform one kind of action. For example: emerald mines have always three slots, but you will need only two dwarfs to take one emerald. When this task is done (collect one emerald) your two dwarfs will return to your pool.<br/><br/>When a player completes three goals (both open and secret goals are taken into account), the endgame begins. Players who had not played this round make their last turn and, then, the game ends. The points are calculated and wins the match who has more points.<br/><br/><br/>Note:  This edition also contains the special class meeples from Dwar7s Fall: Royal Decrees; the Guardian, the Warrior, and the King. It does not include the Scenario or Royal Decree cards.<br/><br/>",

Winning the game will take strategy as players will team up with the other players and ultimately using them to their own advantage. While Snakes and Hawks is a team game, there is only one individual winner. You can play 12 unique versions. This is a very thrilling and different card game.<br/>Unlike a normal deck of cards, Snakes and Hawks is played with a 60-card deck. Snakes and Hawks can be played with teams, but unlike other popular trick taking games, your partner doesn&rsquo;t always have to sit across from you. Your partner can also change every time the cards are dealt. Choosing the right partner could make the difference between winning and losing, The game ends when a player reaches positive 200 or negative 100.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After a life of raids and robberies, Captain Morgan retired from piracy. He created a magic map that would remind him where he buried his ill-gotten gains. He tore the map in many pieces to foil those who would try to find his treasures. Unfortunately for the old pirate, he was cursed by a sorceress many years ago. This curse has turned his torn-up map into a guide for others to find his treasures!<br/><br/>You have come into possession of many pieces of Morgan's map. Every time the fragments are rearranged, they magically point to the right place to dig! But other pirates have found parts of the magic map as well, so now you must race your fellow pirates to see who can collect the most valuable treasures before the map fades to dust forever.<br/><br/>Morgan's Magic Map is played over a series of turns in which players use map cards to locate where Captain Morgan has hidden his treasures. To set up, place the twenty map tiles in a 4x5 grid, with water and land edges always being adjacent to one another. Most map tiles include a reference point, such as The Tomb, The 3 Columns, or Big Nose Bay. Each player starts with two doubloons and four map cards in hand; each map card shows a reference point, a distance from the reference point, and a bonus icon.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can take a map tile that has a free edge and move it elsewhere, as long as the map stays in one piece, water touches water, and no pirate is on the tile. Next, you can move your pirate &mdash; which starts in a corner of the map &mdash; up to two spaces orthogonally. Then if you meet the condition on any map cards in hand, you can play them since you've followed their directions to find treasure. If, for example, a map card shows The Tomb and has a 3 on it, then you can play that map card if you are three (orthogonal) spaces away from The Tomb. Treasure cards come in six colors, and five cards are available on a treasure board, with the more valuable cards being deeper on the board. If you play three map cards on a turn, then you can take any one of the topmost three cards. The deeper you dig, the more doubloons you earn along with the treasure!<br/><br/>Each map card has a bonus on it, and once you've played a map card, you keep it in front of you until you use the bonus, whether to move an extra map tile, walk farther with your pirate, or dig deeper when you locate treasure.<br/><br/>Once the deck of treasure cards is exhausted, the game ends. For each of the six treasure types, whoever has the most of that type earns a 6 doubloon bonus, with tied players splitting the bonus. Sum up the doubloons you collected during the game, bonuses, and the value of the treasures themselves to see who ended up the richest pirate.<br/><br/>",

Minutes ago you were in a sweat-drenched locker room; now you&rsquo;re in the centre the ring, fending off attacks from a glistening muscleman with a fish for a head. This is the Glorious Wrestling Alliance - and you&rsquo;re the newest addition to the roster!<br/><br/>Glorious Wrestling Alliance: Ultrabrawl is a fast-and-frantic card game for 2-4 players that captures all the honour, passion and pageantry of the squared circle. Based on the comics of the same name, Ultrabrawl sees players assume the roles of one of six GWA combatants as they slug it out in their mission to be crowned champion!<br/><br/>Players play move cards in order to chain together combos, deal damage to their opponents and woo the crowd - all in service of nabbing that all-elusive pinfall. Cards will be drawn, dice will be rolled, egos will be bruised and crushing finishing manoeuvres will be deployed, as the GWA&rsquo;s faintly ridiculous combatants chop, kick and suplex their way to victory!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is an offshoot of Capablanca Chess, using the same pieces, but on a standard 8x8 chessboard.  The game introduces the Capablanca pieces, called Elephant (Chancellor, moves like a Knight-Rook) and Hawk (Archbishop/Cardinal, moves like a Knight-Bishop) by means of a double move.  The double move is similar to a castle move in that it involves two pieces, with there being the OPTION of adding the Elephant or Hawk to the board in a newly vacated space in the back rank.  This double move is the ONLY way the Elephant and Hawk can be added to the board. There are 8 opportunities to bring Hawk and Elephant into play. When castling, the Hawk or Elephant can either be placed on the King or Rook initial squares, but no gating of both pieces is permitted.<br/><br/>You can find valuable informations on Yasser Seirawan website:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.seirawanchess.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.seirawanchess.com</a><br/>You can play online at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.musketeerchess.net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.musketeerchess.net</a><br/><br/>Alternative site on Wikipedia:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seirawan_chess\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seirawan_chess</a><br/><br/>And also an entry for the game on the Chessvariants.org site:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MLseirawanchess\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MLse...</a><br/><br/>The pieces are available at the House of Staunton:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.houseofstaunton.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.houseofstaunton.com</a><br/><br/>Pieces are also available on Amazon Europe.<br/><br/>An alternative design of the Elephant and Hawk is Chancellor and Archbishop respectively.<br/><br/>Take a look at a sister Chess Variant: Musketeer Chess<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.musketeerchess.net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.musketeerchess.net</a><br/><br/>",

Load up with as much as you can carry and run head first into the dungeon, exploring rooms and revealing monsters, all while keeping track of hidden treasures and swords!<br/><br/>During play, you must efficiently play the 5 cards in your hand for any combination of movement, strength, or energy. Movement advances you deeper into the dungeon allowing you to peek at or reveal the cards along the way. Monsters you find can only be defeated with strength. New items (and swords!) are acquired by spending cards in your hand for energy. Many items have effects that will further expand your tactical options as your deck grows.<br/><br/>As you defeat monsters and pick up loot, do your best to remember where everything is hidden. Treasures and slain monsters are worth gold, so get collecting! Once the dungeon has been thoroughly ransacked, or the boss is defeated, whoever has the most gold wins!<br/><br/>You can use Dungeon Builder Sets to spice up your dungeon. Each set contains 15 cards (including a new Boss) that can be slapped onto a standalone dungeon to lengthen your game and add new challenges and puzzles to solve! The Heads of the Hydra Dungeon Builder Set features a battle against hydra head monsters. For each head of The Hydra you have defeated, the weaker the boss becomes. It also has an interesting variety of new monsters, items, and obstacles.<br/><br/>",

You must always keep an eye open on other players and try to hinder them, as they will return the favor if given the chance. Only the best player will become sushi master.<br/><br/>RYCE is a roll &amp; write game which uses customized 6-sided and 8-sided dice with typical ingredients on each face. You will prepare different kinds of maki, fry shrimps to make tempura and boil a lot of rice to make the good old salmon nigiri.<br/><br/>Each turn the active player rolls all dice and takes two ingredients to prepare recipes. But everybody else also takes one of the leftover ingredients because everybody acts in each turn, there is no time to rest in the kitchen. With the taken ingredients you cover steps on a recipe and, once every step is done, you deliver the dish to a table. Finishing a recipe grants victory points and you become more skilled with it: next time you finish that recipe, it will be worth more! Meanwhile a race is on to finish serving each table and get the juicy bonus victory points for being the first to do so.<br/><br/>RYCE is a fast-paced 1-4 game, with simultaneous actions and randomized setup. Included in the rulebook there is a variant for the 1 vs 1 game and rules for solo play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player chooses the identity of a DC character who has powers you can use on every turn! After you choose your character, you play the game with a corresponding Character Deck.<br/><br/>In the UNO Ultimate card game you match colors, numbers, and symbols just like classic UNO. Each Character Deck has special power and Wild Cards designed just for that character. There's also a Danger Deck with &quot;Event&quot;, &quot;Enemy&quot;, &quot;Item&quot; and &quot;Location&quot; cards that can really change the game!<br/><br/>Like any great superhero battle, there's going to be a lot of powers and stuff lying around, so buckle-up and pay attention! There are also two ways to win: Get rid of all your cards in your hand or be the last player standing with cards in their character deck. Look out for more add-on decks to expand your game (sold separately)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Aquaman<br/><br/>        The king of the seven seas, Aquaman needs to have his locations in play to really take control of the game.

        "description": "A classic simple railway racing game, perhaps the first modern railroading game, where you draw the railway lines on hex-board. This is the original version of the game, which went through several iterations before ultimately appearing as a boxed game as Railway Rivals and Dampfross. It was designed by David Watts, a Welsh geography teacher and train buff.<br/><br/>It was always intended first and foremost to be a good game to play, but David also wanted to use it for general education &ndash; explaining why railway lines were laid where they were, etc. The game is fundamentally straightforward &ndash; players build railway lines on a map (a tesselation of hexagons) with towns, rivers, hills, coastlines, etc. After a building phase there is then a racing phase &ndash; players race between randomly generated combinations of towns. Players with the most extensive efficient networks tend to win more races, and thus the game.<br/><br/>It always existed as 'just' a set of rules, with a number of official or unofficial maps available from various sources. The earliest and crudest manifestation was just a few (5 or 6) A4 hexagon sheets, and colouring instructions to make the maps up. When postal games players showed considerable enthusiasm for the game, David moved on to produce large size (slightly bigger than A2) hexagon sheets, also with colouring instructions. Later on the maps were printed in one colour on big maps, which you could colour highlight yourself, and cover with sticky-back plastic sheets, so that maps could be reused if water-based pens were used that could be washed off. Multicolour maps followed, which were later printed with a laminate covering.<br/><br/>The railways cost more if you go over mountains etc, but this gives you shorter routes. You can run parallel to other lines at a cost, or simply link into another player's track and rent the tracks of other players when you race.<br/><br/>The mechanics are very simple, and there is some luck involved with the random races that appear, and in racing. Nevertheless, the better players nearly always come out on top. Despite the apparent simplicity, there are plenty of opportunities for thoughtful play, especially with tactics such as blocking other players out of areas of the map.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rifles in the Peninsula is the third game of the solitaire RIFLES series, which also includes Rifles in the Pacific and Rifles in the Ardennes. The focus of this new title is on the Napoleonic Wars (1799-1815).<br/><br/>The RIFLES system allows the recreation of small combat engagements (five to ten units per side), using an abstract map that represents the main features of the terrain like trees, buildings, hills. Placement of terrain features is guided but is never the same on each game, always creating new tactical challenges. The enemy strategy and the fog of war is recreated with the use of random Event Markers and &ldquo;Activation Tables&rdquo; that drive the enemy units toward their objective.<br/><br/>Rifles in the Peninsula introduces new rules to cover unique aspects of the Napoleonic Wars including mounted troops, formations, and the impact of the longer reload time of the weapons of the period (pistols, muskets, and rifles). The different attributes of the units (combat factors, quality, special traits) grenadiers, voltigeurs, cuirassiers and dragoons.<br/><br/>The Campaign game has been greatly redesigned and is now based on the timeline of the main campaigns of the period. The new Glory Track will represent the career of the Leader of your units, your avatar in the game, and your rank will have a direct influence on the game. Each year of the campaign includes four to six main &ldquo;scenes&rdquo;: a scene can trigger one Mission on the battlefield or a Campaign Event. Twelve different Missions are available, covering classical military duties like reconnaissance as well as iconic battle episodes like the capture of a gun. Campaign Events are resolved without the need to setup the battlefield and cover episodes like barrack inspections, field maneuvers and of course duels. As a bonus, an optional mini-game The Duel (inspired by the movie, The Duelists)has been included in the package: this mini-game allows players to re-create a saber duel with a more personal perspective, providing an additional level of immersion in the historical period.<br/><br/>From thundering muskets, to rattle of sabers, Rifles in the Peninsula vividly recreates Napoleonic skirmishes like never before.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Load up with as much as you can carry and run head first into the dungeon, exploring rooms and revealing monsters, all while keeping track of hidden treasures and swords!<br/><br/>During play, you must efficiently play the 5 cards in your hand for any combination of movement, strength, or energy. Movement advances you deeper into the dungeon allowing you to peek at or reveal the cards along the way. Monsters you find can only be defeated with strength. New items (and swords!) are acquired by spending cards in your hand for energy. Many items have effects that will further expand your tactical options as your deck grows.<br/><br/>As you defeat monsters and pick up loot, do your best to remember where everything is hidden. Treasures and slain monsters are worth gold, so get collecting! Once the dungeon has been thoroughly ransacked, or the boss is defeated, whoever has the most gold wins!<br/><br/>You can use Dungeon Builder Sets to spice up your dungeon. Each set contains 15 cards (including a new Boss) that can be slapped onto a standalone dungeon to lengthen your game and add new challenges and puzzles to solve! The Hive Empress's Builder Set is a good all-around set of cards. It has an interesting variety of new monsters, items, and obstacles.<br/><br/>",

Not only is the game fun, but through play, players understand group immunity and the need to vaccinate. Players ages 7-65, and both casual and hardcore gamers have enjoyed POX.<br/><br/>Players cooperate to vaccinate and cure people on the board until the disease is fully contained, before the number of deaths exceeds acceptable losses or the disease becomes out of control. The players win or lose together. Players alternate drawing cards. Each card specifies how the disease spreads, and then which public health resources the player has available for allocation. It's important to protect the vulnerable people on the board, because if they become infected, they immediately die. But watch out! Don't neglect the infected people because they can die too if the infection gets too bad!<br/><br/>Many public health groups need to better promote immunizations in order to continue to prevent vaccine preventable diseases. Vaccinations against deadly diseases such as diphtheria, polio, and whooping cough were standard public health measures, and they worked: kids today don&rsquo;t worry about getting polio, for example. But due to suspicions about vaccines and links to other diseases, more parents are refusing to immunize their children, and this could lead to a national health crisis. Parents mistakenly believe that vaccines aren&rsquo;t necessary any more, or that children develop immunity to these diseases automatically through time. These myths lead to disaster. Whooping cough is back, for example, for the U.S. has lost what is called herd immunity to this disease as the percent of vaccinated people is lowering, allowing ways for contagion to spread among the populace.<br/><br/>Between POX's unique packaging and gameplay, what's stopping YOU from saving the people?!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Vietnam War (or the American War to the Vietnamese) defined a generation, whether it was through service in Vietnam or opposition to the war. The war in Vietnam, fought nearly half a century ago, remains one of the longest and bloodiest wars since the Second World War. Despite its popular depiction as a guerrilla war of endless patrols and small ambushes, both sides were constantly looking for decisive victories in large-scale battles.<br/><br/>The Free World had all of the advantages of mobility and firepower. Whole battalions flew into battle in helicopters, while the air cavalry rarely even set foot on the ground. Armoured cavalry and mechanised infantry used their M113 &lsquo;tracks&rsquo; both for mobility and heavy firepower. Of course, the majority of soldiers were still &lsquo;grunts&rsquo; fighting on foot, but even they could call in massive firepower at will.<br/><br/>The Nationalists had the advantages of the home team. They fought as guerrillas, appearing as if from nowhere to ambush the Free World forces hunting them and used local knowledge to outwit their foes. Later, as the war progressed, they switched to conventional tactics using armoured forces in open battle.<br/><br/>This book allows you to recreate these battles on the tabletop using the popular Flames Of War rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Aguirre, designed by the writer Bryce Journey, is a thematic Euro-style historical game about the last and most infamous Spanish expedition to find El Dorado. During the course of this expedition, Don Lope de Aguirre (later known as The Madman and The Tyrant) assassinated the conquistador leading the expedition and the nobleman he propped up in his stead before taking over the expedition personally. Recognizing that El Dorado was a myth and that the only gold to be found was back in Peru, Aguirre declared himself Prince of Peru and changed the purpose of his expedition to overthrow the Pizzaros and take over the country for himself. Sailing down the Amazon and Orinoco rivers, Aguirre's expedition faced all manner of challenges in the form of disease, privation, navigation, lack of morale, and attacks from the natives, against whom Aguirre committed barbaric atrocities (there are portions of South America where Aguirre's name is still used as a curse today). Members of Aguirre's expedition discovered to their dismay that the most dangerous of all the challenges, however, was Aguirre's growing paranoia. One by one, Aguirre executed his own men when he grew suspicious of them, sometimes with cause, more often without. Ultimately, Aguirre managed to capture a Spanish fort before being besieged by government forces, when he was executed by one of his own men, one of the few survivors of his ill-fated expedition.<br/><br/>In the game, players will take on the role of one of the unfortunate members of Aguirre's expedition. Their goal? To accumulate enough influence to overthrow Aguirre before they are executed in turn. In the end, only one player will survive Aguirre&rsquo;s paranoia. Only one player will be able to accumulate enough influence to overthrow him. Only one player will emerge from the depths of hell on earth to tell the tale of The Tyrant Aguirre!<br/><br/>The principal game mechanics are role/action selection and set collection. Players will earn Influence (victory) Points through a variety of methods, including influencing prominent members of the expedition (the role/action selection part of the game), purchasing Supply Cards (the set collection part of the game), and overcoming thematic challenges. One of these challenges is the &quot;paranoia phase,&quot; in which one of the roles/actions is removed from the game every turn, resulting in a diminishing array of role/actions for players to choose from as the game progresses. The game challenges players to use reactive and adaptive strategy, as players must frequently shift and adjust what they want to do in the game according to the changing conditions of the game.<br/><br/>Aguirre is a fast-paced game for 2-6 players and lasts 30-90 minutes depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>",

We can't, either.<br/><br/>Instead, what if history could be fun? What if you could give George Washington a cannon and have him blast William Sherman into the next dimension? What if, rather than just reading about Annie Oakley's sharpshooting skill, you could actually GIVE her a rifle and have her snipe your opponent until s/he begs for mercy?<br/><br/>Now you can. You've heard of American History X? Well, this is American History Y -- as in Yuge battles! Heroes of History is an expandable card game that lets players use real-life people, weapons, battlegrounds, and items to battle each other for supremacy. Each card features professionally-drawn pictures of historical figures such as Tecumseh, Clara Barton, and Deborah Sampson; locations such as Saratoga, Little Bighorn, and Fort McHenry; and items such as the Winchester and Ben Franklin's Lightning Rod. It's a fun way to learn -- or an educational way to have fun.<br/><br/>Game play is simple. Each player takes turns drawing cards and playing Characters to the Trench. Players can also play Supply cards that have some temporary effects. They can also equip weapons to characters and play Battleground cards that give bonuses to all Characters in play for the player that has summoned them. Players begin with 50 State Points and take turns attacking each other until one player is reduced to 0 or a player runs out of cards to play.<br/><br/>Future sets will include Heroes from history as well as from mythology. What would happen if Thor faced off against Washington? What if Washington had Mjolnir and Thor had a bayonet? Only you know the answer to that.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the premiere, Juliet thrusts a stage dagger into herself on stage in front of a full house. As Juliet dies, it becomes clear &ndash; Somebody must have switched the prop with a real dagger.<br/><br/>Welcome to the exciting world of Minebury City Theater! You have all been working towards this premiere for a long time: &ldquo;Romeo and Juliet&rdquo; by William Shakespeare.<br/><br/>But the production seems ill-fated. Patrick was rejected a few weeks ago when he asked Juliet&rsquo;s hand in marriage. As a result, everyone was anxious to see how it would turn out when the two lead actors appeared on stage together. At first the premiere seemed to run smoothly. At 8:00 pm, the curtain rose in front of a full house. The play lasted three hours including the intermission.<br/><br/>At the end of the play, at 11:00 pm, the tragedy occurred: Juliet had picked up the stage dagger behind the stage from among the other props. She dramatically thrust the blade into her body. At first the audience was enthralled by her impressive performance. But when Patrick saw Juliet&rsquo;s blood and called out for a doctor, the audience realized what they had just witnessed was in fact a real tragedy: Somebody had switched the stage dagger with a real knife.<br/><br/>Arriving shortly after, the emergency services could do nothing but pronounce Juliet dead at the scene. The question is: which of the people present is responsible for Juliet&rsquo;s gruesome death?<br/><br/>What is a murder mystery game?<br/><br/>You and your guests slip into the roles of the main suspects of an exciting murder case. The objective of the game is to convict the perpetrator &ndash; one of the people sitting with you at the table. This can only be achieved if the players discuss the course of events amongst themselves and compare their experiences of what happened. But be careful: Each character (including you!) has their own dark secrets which they&rsquo;d be better off keeping to themselves.<br/><br/>You all gather in the wake of the crime and attempt to piece together your memories, with the aim of identifying the perpetrator. In each round, you recall more and more about the circumstances of the crime, as each round deals with a different period of time from the evening the crime was committed. At the end, everyone votes on who should be handed over to the police as the suspect.<br/><br/>Culinario Mortale is a highly interactive game. There are only a few rules, and no pre-prepared dialogue. The focus is on working through the puzzles and discussing the events together.<br/><br/>Alongside a well-structured game manual, each game contains game booklets for between five and eight characters (the number of players for each game can be found on the packaging and here on our website). In the game booklets, each guest will find their personal clues and a description of their role. Each game booklet also includes a brief overview of how the game works. As such, all players can jump right in. The support code included with your Culinario Mortale game will allow you to download the role descriptions in advance from our website in PDF format, and easily send them to your guests via email.<br/><br/>GAME CONTENT:<br/>1 Game Manual, 8 Game Booklets, 1 Incident Booklet (includes of prologue, incidents, solution), 8 name badges, 1 support code<br/><br/>&mdash; description from the publisher.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Symple is an abstract strategy game in which two players strive to get as much area as possible with as few groups as possible.<br/><br/>Players alternate making a move. White plays with the white stones and makes the first move, Black plays with the black stones. On his turn, a player may choose either a) to place a stone on the board without contact to other stones of his color in order to start a new group, or b) to grow all possible groups by one stone. Stones touching two groups count as growing both groups. However, if two groups are grown by one stone each and only the two newly grown stones touch, then the move is legal.<br/><br/>For balancing, there is an extra rule: Black is allowed to grow all his groups and place a single stone as long as neither player has not yet grown any groups.<br/><br/>The game ends when the board is filled in. The score is determined by the number of stones each player has on the board minus 'P' times the number of groups he has, where 'P' is en even number of 4 or higher. With an even penalty and an odd boardsize, draws are not possible.<br/><br/>Symple is played on a square board, normally the 19x19 goban. The version on a hexhex board is called HexSymple.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.mindsports.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.mindsports.nl/</a> - (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>",

In the World of Tanks: Miniatures Game the KV-1S is bringing something new to the table; our first Heavy Tank. Heavy tanks are great damage soaks that can re-roll a blank defense dice. You can&rsquo;t ignore them because they can grind up the table and seize objectives or break up formations, but their ability to bounce enemy shells means you need to really concentrate your fire to knock them down. Adding Smooth Ride lets you keep you tank on the move (with the bonus defense dice that this provides) without suffering the usual penalty when shooting at enemy tanks.<br/><br/>",

The villainous Haman has been put to death, but his murderous plan lives on through his ten sons. You are loyal messengers of the King and Queen, tasked with putting a stop to the hatred infecting the empire and securing peace for the children of Israel.<br/><br/>Purim is a cooperative card-management and area-control game. You and your fellow messengers must work together to spread the King&rsquo;s proclamation, represented by gold cubes, to all the far-flung provinces of the empire.  At the same time Haman&rsquo;s ten sons are trying to orchestrate the destruction of the Jewish people by spreading their false messages, represented by black cubes.<br/><br/>Every round each player will receive a set number of Action Cards that have a Loyal Action, an Evil Action, and an End Effect.  Players simultaneously select one Action Card from their hand and then reveal it.  The Action Cards are then processed based each card's number with the card's Loyal Action happening first before the Evil Action.  Loyal Actions will generally add gold cubes to the board, move Messengers, or remove Sons of Haman while Evil Actions will generally add black cubes or move the Calendar tile forward.  This process of selecting and playing Action Cards repeats until all but one card has been played in each player's hand.  When this occurs the last cards are revealed and the cards processed in numerical order with only the End Effect happening.  The round then ends and a new round begins.<br/><br/>The game end triggers when either the Calendar tile reaches the end of the Calendar, or players run out of gold or black cubes.  If each Province has gold cubes equal to or greater than the number of black cubes, the players win the game. If even one Province has more black cubes than gold cubes, the players have failed the King and lose the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The youngest player starts the game, then players take turns in clockwise order.<br/><br/>From the jumping point, a playing token moves based on how much energy the player puts into the jump. After a token jumps to a tile, it applies a force to the tile (as on a trampoline) and flings any tokens on that tile to adjacent tiles. Then the referee token goes to the next jumping point in clockwise order, and the top playing tokens again go to the jumping points and players take their turns in order again. If a playing token remains at a jumping point, the new token is placed behind the previous one to create an entrance line.<br/><br/>As soon as a player obtains three tiles of the same colors or the same name, they reveal their card and win. Since you don't know the other players' colors, you might do something which accidentally helps another player win, so jump with care!<br/><br/>",

The twist here is that the rotating board of Yama contains triangular slots that stand the cube up on its corner - revealing three sides, each of which can be seen from a different point of view. And it is in one of these three point-of-views in which you must try to form your line of four-in-a-row.<br/><br/>With Yama we strove to design the components such that they convey the rules. The cubes are painted such that no matter how you orient it one side will show a different color to the other two. The way placing three cubes in a cluster forms a valley for placement of the next level which covers up and block your opponent, or cliches your victory. These all contributes to making Yama one of the easiest and most intuitive game to learn.<br/><br/>However the game itself is treacherously easy to lose yet deeply strategic and tactical when played by two equally skilled players. The three dimension aspect of the victory goal and the three dimensional aspect of the cube placement can be very tricky to wrap your head around - leading to surprising twists and turns that belies it simple rules and components.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This two-player strategy game uses an 11x4 board from a game played circa 1150 BC (which is unfamiliar to me, shame). The two central spaces are special, and each player owns his home row, leaving two central rows over which the struggle plays out.  Each player attempts to prevent the other from having any remaining moves, by occupying spaces and taking his ten pieces away.  Stacking is involved --I think you get to move a stack if it is topped by one of your pieces, and if you bring it into your home row you capture the opposing pieces?<br/><br/>Check out the beautiful board at Pharao-Brettspiele's home page.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Destiny, the Ritual Game of Fortune, concerns the journey through Life as the players try to keep Fortune nearby from Birth to Death. The large board is themed with the signs of the Zodiac and has 5 concentric rings (orbits) and spirals forming the path of life. There is a large (11cm) latex statuette of Lady Luck and players spend tokens, representing years of their life, to an altar to move themselves and the statuette around the board. They can also block spaces with fire tokens. When each player has spent all its tokens, it has died. When the last player dies, whoever Fortune is nearest to, first collects tokens from the altar as a multiple of their age (the orbit they reached) by the number of players. The next player does the same, but multiplied by one less and so on. Presumably the basic game ends with the player with the most tokens winning (the rules don't say!). The advanced game rules allow additional variants, such as bidding or bartering or a quiz based game. One variant goes on to use the won tokens as the start of the After-Life and the designer, Dr Bronia Grycz, encourages players to develop their own rules. The box has copyright 1977.<br/><br/>",

Because dice were frowned upon as instruments of the horrible vice of gambling, included a teetotum, a sort of spinner used to randomly yield a number from 1 to 8.  This is used to determine the first player. Lines are drawn on the map to connect cities in a continuous path which players must follow. However, the cities are not named, but numbered. <br/>Upon arrival, at a new city, the player must correctly name the place and, if playing the advanced version, its population, or lose a turn and try again.. The first to reach New Orleans (population 10,000) wins.<br/><br/>The first known game published in the United States.  Unlike other games, it was also invented in the USA rather  than being a copy of a British game, as many later ones were. The publisher were sellers of books in New York and later in 1822 also released Traveller's Tour Through Europe.<br/><br/>A copy is apparently still in existence and archived at the American Antiquarian Society.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shadow Wars is a fantasy strategy board game where each player chooses one of the four rulers within the game: Human, Dwarf, Elf or Dark Elf. These rulers have different advantages, disadvantages and play styles. Some rulers have mighty soldiers and defenses but are weaker in magic. Where as, other rulers are extremely powerful when it comes to magic but have weaker and fewer soldiers than the other rulers. Players must learn how to best use their ruler and play against the other three vastly different: Rulers, Units, Creatures, Magic, Buildings and Strategies. A full description and artwork can be found at: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.shadowwars.net\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.shadowwars.net</a><br/><br/>Each player starts with a Capital, two towns and one special building. From these locations the players can slowly build up their resources to obtain additional Towns, Cities and special buildings. Each new building will give that player an additional advantage, but also takes resources to build. A few examples of these buildings are: Armory, Mine, Mage Tower, Blood Forge, Dark Library &amp; Cathedral. As each individual player expands their empire they can hire vast armies, summon powerful creatures &amp; conquer new lands. With all of the various units and buildings each game is unique and, most of all, fun. The last player with a Capital left standing is the King of Syrrith!<br/><br/>",

Includes SCARNEY, a skill game based on an entirely new game principle known as The Kaleidoscopic Principle; HIGH-LOW SCARNEY, the world's quickest ending skill game; SCARNEY CHECKERS, a checker style game wiht a Gin Rummy scoring; SCARNEY CHALLENGE, an unequaled point scoring track game; SOLITAIRE SCARNEY and MOKO SOLITAIRE, the two greatest all-skill solitaire board games ever invented. The perfect diversion for home and club.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>The board consists of a 4 x 4 grid. The pieces are numbered 1-4 in four different colors (making 16 in all). In the basic game, each player removes a &quot;1&quot; piece, and then takes turns jumping and removing pieces (like in checkers, but orthogonally, not diagonally). Each piece that is jumped must be of a different color than the one which is moved.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player cannot make another move. If the remaining pieces are of different colors, the player who CANNOT move takes the remaining pieces and adds their total to his score. However, if the pieces are all of the SAME color, the PREVIOUS player (the one who made the last move) gets the points, plus a 10-point-per-piece bonus. If the remaining colors are all black, the bonus is increased to 20 points per piece.<br/><br/>Needless to say, there are numerous variations to these rules among the 39 other games that can be played with this set.<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>The second and third editions boasted only 25 games, and these are listed below.<br/><br/>1    SCARNEY SOLITAIRE<br/>        2    SCARNEY SOLITAIRE MATCH<br/>        3    ADVANCED SCARNEY SOLITAIRE<br/>        4    ADVANCED SCARNEY SOLITAIRE MATCH<br/>    5    SCARNEY SINGLES<br/>        6    ADVANCED SCARNEY SINGLES<br/>        7    SCARNEY 101 SINGLES<br/>        8    ADVANCED SCARNEY 101 SINGLES<br/>        9    SCARNEY SINGLES LOWBALL<br/>        10    ADVANCED SCARNEY SINGLES LOWBALL<br/>    11    SCARNEY DOUBLES<br/>        12    ADVANCED SCARNEY DOUBLES<br/>        13    SCARNEY GIN DOUBLES (or Scarney Gin Doubles Match Play For Two Players)<br/>        14    ADVANCED SCARNEY GIN DOUBLES<br/>        15    SCARNEY GIN DOUBLES FOR THREE PLAYERS<br/>        16    ADVANCED SCARNEY GIN DOUBLES FOR THREE PLAYERS<br/>        17    SCARNEY PARTNERSHIP GIN DOUBLES<br/>        18    ADVANCED SCARNEY PARTNERSHIP GIN DOUBLES<br/>    19    SCARNEY CHALLENGE SOLITAIRE<br/>        20    SCARNEY CHALLENGE SOLITAIRE FOR CHILDREN<br/>        21    SCARNEY CHALLENGE SINGLES<br/>        22    SCARNEY CHALLENGE SINGLES OPPONENT&rsquo;S CHOICE (or Name The Color)<br/>        23    SCARNEY SPEEDY CHALLENGE SINGLES<br/>    24    HIGH-LOW SCARNEY (or High-Low Match Play, or High-Low Scarney Match Play, or High-Low Match Play Scarney)<br/>        25    HIGH-LOW SCARNEY FOR THREE PLAYERS (or High-Low Three-Handed, or High-Low Scarney Three-Handed,  or High-Low Three-Handed Scarney)<br/>        26    PARTNERSHIP HIGH-LOW SCARNEY (or Four-Handed Partnership High-Low Scarney)<br/><br/>There are in fact only five main games - numbers 1, 5, 11, 19, and 24 - with the others merely being minor variants or ways of incorporating additional players into the same basic framework of play.  These base games are all described in &quot;Scarne's Encyclopedia of Games&quot;.<br/><br/>Game 19 (and its variants numbers 21-23) has a set of 9 different objectives that can be set at the start (and two of these objectives have a choice of two flavours).  The children's version, number 20, has a choice of 5 such objectives.  Not having seen the rule book for the first edition of Scarney, I speculate that the figure of &quot;40&quot; may be derived simply by counting these different objectives within a game as distinct games.<br/><br/>",

It is a scientifically designed game system which reproduces the dynamics of modern professional football.  The Flanker-T offense versus the 4-3-4 defense with statistical accuracy and realism.  Physical factors balance out.  Each team is exactly equal in power, speed and proficiency. Children&rsquo;s Hour 2-4<br/><br/>There are twelve Offense Cards and nine Defense Cards. Each players chooses a card secretly. The player on offense then declares whether the play action will take place on the weak side or strong side. The player on offense rolls three six-sided dice and the player on defense rolls two six-sided dice. The die rolls are modified by the play choices and the resulting yardage is the modified offensive roll minus the modified defensive roll. Results of the plays are recorded using a grease pencil on the laminated gameboard.<br/><br/>To get instructions concerning penalties and organizing a league, one would have had to contact the now defunct publisher.<br/><br/>",

They managed to channel their energy into producing this 'add-on' Booklet to cover whatever it was that they had skipped or missed in the previous offerings. &quot;Book 2&quot; has the same 'front-cover' that the BOXED set has, and is 12 pages(not including the FRONT &amp; BACK covers), with the Introduction &amp; 'Contents' on the inside of the slick Front cover. There was also a *BONUS* of an advert-sheet for even MORE 'minis', with their accompanying 'stats' on this, AND some pictures of those. There are NOW even &quot;Galactic Transports&quot; made available, with their own 'stats' included for use in this. &quot;Book 2&quot; gives us '2' NEW 'Advanced Rules'-&quot;Special Damage&quot; &amp; &quot;Damage Control&quot;! Here's a listing of the 'Contents': &quot;Starfortresses&quot;; &quot;Super Galactic Dreadnaughts&quot;; &quot;Starbombers&quot;; &quot;Star Armored Pursuit Ships&quot;; &quot;CapTacs&quot;; &quot;Special Damage&quot;; &amp; &quot;Damage Control Rules&quot;. There is yet another &quot;Stats Sheet&quot; in the middle of this one for additional information on the NEW units introduced with this. It goes into great detail and description about ALL of what has been previously mentioned.<br/><br/>The &quot;Star Fortresses&quot; require *Special* mention, since they are 'modular' in composition. This means that you can pick &amp; choose what it is that you'd like them to be comprised of. These 'pieces' consist of the following: 'Weapons Pod'(W.P.); 'Medium Auxiliary Weapon System'(M.A.W.S.); Life Support System(L.S.S.); Mobile Armed Destroyer(M.A.D.); Communication Module(C.M.); and Small Auxiliary Weapons System(S.A.W.S.). You may wish to include at least one of the 'L.S.S.' modules, unless you have 'droids' manning these, or it's 'automated'! The 'components' are able to be connected together in order to 'fashion' one of these formidable &quot;Fortresses&quot;, without having to use an adhesive on them in some form or manner. I will mention that there were NO 'minis' included with this and they have to be &quot;purchased separately&quot;!<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Starfleet Wars<br/><br/><br/>",

Troopers can be suppressed or killed - heroes get a saving throw to avoid the latter.<br/><br/>A point buy system is provided - there are some differences among the factions - the government troops and police tend to be better equipped while the rebels, scavs and savages are fast moving.<br/><br/>There are 3 scenarios provided: Encounter (a basic firefight), Raid and Capture and Assassination.

One side of each card represents a Street or City Park; the opposite side of each card represents a Room -- Bedroom, Art Gallery or Gymnasium are examples. This represents players&rsquo; movement along dark city streets and into and out of unlocked buildings. Players DO NOT conceal their cards, and points are accumulated by playing &quot;VAMPIRO&quot; (vampire) cards atop the cards on an &quot;In-Play&quot; pile. Each time any player places a &quot;DOOR&quot; card on the In-Play Pile, all cards are &quot;flipped,&quot; revealing the cards&rsquo; opposite side. Play is fast-paced. A good memory will benefit play. OCHO VAMPIROS is best as a strategy game when played with four or six players in teams of two, working in conjunction to accumulate points. Cards are art-quality and sold online and through art galleries Only one deck is required for play; however, experts add additional decks to increase strategy options.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gala, also knows as &quot;farmer's chess&quot; or &quot;pagan chess&quot; was a game played in some farmers villages in northern Germany. The game probably comes from the middle ages. It has been mentioned in the game books by R. C. Bell, Jack Botermans / Pieter van Delft and Glonnegger.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board of ten by ten squares. The four corners of four by four squares are distinguished by a line, thus shaping a cross two lines wide, consisting of the  rows 5 and 6 and/or the columns e and f. These lines are called deflection lines.<br/>Each player has eight Kampas (pawns), five Horsas and Kornas and two Galas (kings), placed like this:<br/>White:<br/>Gala a1, j1; Korna a3, b2, c1, i1, j2; Horsa a2, b1, h1, i2, j3; Kampa a4, b3, c2, d1, g1, h2, i3, j4. <br/>Black:<br/>Gala a10, j10; Korna a9, b10, h10, i9, j8; Horsa a8, b9, c10, i10, j9; Kampa a7, b8, c9, d10, g10, h9, i8, j7.<br/><br/>Galas move in general as kings in chess. Additionally, when a Gala is on one of the four squares in the middle of the board, it may be moved in one move to any empty square on the board with the exception of those squares that contain a piece in the opening setup. Kings can only take when moving over a deflection line. <br/>A Korna moves as a rook in chess when in a corner of the board, and as a bishop in the middle of the board. It is also possible to combine these moves in one turn! Kornas can only take in moves where they move over a deflection line. <br/>Horsas are just the opposite of Kornas (with an additional small difference in the taking rules): they move as bishops on the corner parts, and as rooks on the middle part. Again it is possible to combine such moves. Horsas only take in moves where they pass the deflection line, but not when they move only one square in rookwise fashion.<br/>Kampas move diagonally towards the middle of the board until they are in the middle part or in the opponents corners. It is allowed to move two squares if the deflection line isn't passed with the first move of the Kampa. When the Kampa is in the middle part or in one of the opponents corners, then it may move one square in any direction. When a Kampa is moved back to a corner of the owning player, it can only move diagonally forward again. Kampas only can take in the move after they have crossed a deflection line.<br/><br/>When a player threatens a king of the opponent, he says: Gala! The opponent must defend the king, if possible. Otherwise, the player takes the king of the opponent. One wins the game by taking both kings of the opponent. <br/>When only two kings of different players are left on the board, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>There are different variants discussed in the internet concerning the moves and the winning (defining another goal in placing the Galas in the 4 squares in the very middle of the board).<br/><br/>",

Shortly before his murder, Captain Kidd experienced an overwhelming sense of his own impending doom. He immediately took steps to settle his affairs and requested that, in the event of his premonition being proved true, his attorney should call a meeting of his closest associates, a group from amongst whom he was sure his killer would emerge.<br/><br/>Captain Kidd was not only a man of foresight and cunning, but he was also a shrewd judge of character and was willing to risk everything, to ensure his killer would be brought to justice. In an attempt to expose his killer, he devised the most fiendish of challenges: one which he was sure his killer would find impossible to resist!<br/><br/>",

There are a couple flirtations, but the host guide tells you how to match up couples so that no one will be offended by this facet of the game.<br/><br/>Please Note: One character is a womanizer and thinks himself irresistible. We tell you which character this is and we advise real conservative groups to not assign him to a guest. So if you are a real conservative group, there will only be 19 usable characters in this game..<br/><br/>Political Intrigue among the Vampyr Houses, Mage Guild, Were Clans &amp; the Fae Court. Not your normal ghouls &amp; goblins!<br/><br/>It is time for the Hidden Councils Annual Costume Ball. It is the social event of the year. The Royal Courts of the Mage, Were, Vampyr &amp; Fae will be in attendance. It is whispered that there will also be a special meeting of the Hidden Council to address the recent Watcher murders. Watchers are important to the Immortals and help keep their existence hidden from humanity. The Immortals in turn have sworn to protect the Watchers for their service.<br/><br/>We think you will be really pleased with the additional activities we have added to this unusual game! It is a little different then our previous games in the following ways: In this game there will be 5 Artifact Weapon Cards. The host will get instructions on where to hide these. Then at a certain time guests will get riddles that will be clues to where the weapons are hidden, then it is a race to see who finds a weapon. The weapons can only be used once &amp; no one can commit murder without a weapon card. These will be very valuable commodities.<br/><br/>Next we will have 20 Spell Cards. Each guest gets to draw one from a hat. If there are any cards left over after the draw guests will roll dice and the highest rollers get the cards! 10 spell cards are helpful game wise &amp; the other 10 are funny spells that will provide a lot of entertainment.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/immortals.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.dinnerandamurder.com/games/immortals.htm</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From publisher:<br/>PBI is a game of company level combat in WW2. PBI is an infantry game with armor present as support. Artillery and the like is off table.<br/><br/>A set of WW2 company level rules. The game is played on a 4 foot by 4 foot grid, split into 6&quot; squares. A company would typically consist of 3 tanks and 25 bases of infantry.<br/><br/>The scale is 1 to 1. This means that a base of three figures represents three men. A tank model represents a real tank. The tabletop scale is 10m to the inch.<br/><br/>The Overall concept.<br/><br/>PBI is intended to provide a two hour wargame. All of the dice used are simple D6. All of the mechanisms are intuitive. PBI uses a gridded board. This means that all movement, range and areas are described in terms of squares. Because the player takes the role of the company commander, the squares of the grid allow him to get soldiers to &quot;go over there and do that&quot;, rather than measuring distances and engaging in single figure management. By using a grid it is very clear what scenery type the figures are in. There are three types of square. Closed (buildings and woods), Partial (hedges, walls and fences) and open (no significant cover).<br/><br/>The rules generate a scenario which both players have a fair chance of winning. The game is always of the attack/defense style.<br/><br/>PBI uses a lot of D6 (a typical section shooting would roll 10 dice). This helps give a feel for the massive amount of ammunition expended and allows the probabilities to even out (the more dice you roll, the more predictable the result).<br/><br/>The aim of PBI is to create company level engagements which players can win by use of better tactics. The game is focussed on the player being a company commander so those are the tasks given to the player.<br/><br/>",

Pennant produces a major league baseball season - and a Pennant-winner - in just a couple of hours of true-to-life thrills and excitement.  Each participant is the owner, general manager, and field manager of his on team.<br/><br/>First participants draft baseball players for their teams from the available players.  The players are color coded with gold being the best, blue the next best, and then red.  These are considered All Star players in the league.  Any position that is not filled is considered to be a regular player.  After teams are drafted then games are played.<br/><br/>Each game is only 1/2 an inning.  It is considered to be the critical 1/2 inning of the game where the game is won or lost.  First a lead is determined for the pitching team of 0-4 runs.  Dice are rolled for each batter and charts are referred to for results until three outs are recorded(the pitching team wins) or the batting team takes the lead(the batting team wins).  The first team to win 20 games wins the pennant.<br/><br/>",

One player, the Arch Villain, attempts to build and execute dastardly plots while the remaining players -- each of whom assumes the role of a classic pulp hero -- try to foil these plots. Among the 10 heroes to choose from are Samantha Starr (intrepid reporter) Grigor the Great (former magician to the Tsar), and the Blue Falcon (ace aviatrix). The game plays out over three Acts, as the Arch Villain works toward the execution of a final Master Plan, such as the construction and activation of a massive death ray, or encasing the world in ice for all eternity.<br/><br/>The key mechanic of the game is the creation of &quot;Adventures,&quot; linked sets of cards that the Heroes must investigate and overcome in order to collect Heroism points. There are two types of Adventures: &quot;Wild Adventures,&quot; which are generated on the fly by a combination of card plays and draws from the various decks; and &quot;Plots,&quot; which are custom-built by the Arch Villain player and have much higher stakes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Halfanutz is a card game about elephants.  Tom Wham's younger sisters couldn't say the word elephant when they were toddlers so they said &quot;halfanutz&quot; instead.<br/><br/>The basic game consists of walkabout and scoring phases.  In the walkabout phase the player draws a card.  Then they can either push their luck and draw another card or they can take the cards they already have behind their screen and pass the turn to somebody else.  If they draw a card with the same picture as a card they already have, they lose the cards they've drawn and their turn.  After all the cards have been drawn, the scoring phase happens.  Players sort their cards by the resource pictured on it, then count the largest pile of cards and subtract the smallest pile of cards.  After two sessions the scores are totaled and a winner declared.<br/><br/>The advanced game adds resources and a trick taking phase (called &quot;the rumble&quot;).  During the walkabout for each card turned over, the player also gets a resource of the type on the card.  The player gets to keep the resource, even if the cards end up being discarded.  During the trick taking phase, the players randomly play a card from the cards they have collected.  The cards are numbered and the highest number wins.  The twist is that your card can be reinforced by resources of the same type as the card played.  The players take turns reinforcing their cards or passing.  The player with the highest card number + resources played wins the trick.  Players then score the number of cards they have taken during the rumble.  Again, two sessions are played and the scores are totaled.<br/><br/>The tournament game is like the advanced game, except the card played during the rumble is not chosen randomly.<br/><br/>Halfanutz is self-published by Tom Wham and is available from his web site, <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.tomwham.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.tomwham.com</a>.<br/><br/>",

The rocky road Man has traveled to reach the stars and the events that came after are given in enough detail to provide a feel for this default setting without being so detailed that the players cannot make it their own.<br/><br/>Nor are players limited to the units and time line provided. Construction rules allow for development of mecha, armored vehicles, aircraft, naval landing and riverine craft, buildings, and infantry types ranging from steampunk to beyond the thirty-fourth century. In addition, players can create almost 900 different planetary environmental conditions in which to do battle with the Hostile Environment rules. Optional rules are also included for infantry morale, pilot skill advancement, and integrating Wardogs with Starmada.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is Lone Canuck's third scenario pack of Canadian actions in WW II Italy.  It contains 10 scenario cards.<br/><br/>Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck Publishing web site:<br/><br/>31 August 1944... The Royal 22nd Regiment moved into action before dawn in a bid to secure the right shoulder of the breach in the Gothic Line. Engineers worked through the night to clear three narrow paths in the minefield where the West Novas had earlier come to grief, Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Allard hurried two companies forward.<br/><br/>1 September 1944... In the centre, the Fifth Division had not been idle. Monte Peloso and Tomba di Pesaro were its primary objectives, but it took most of the day to complete their capture. The original plan called for the Perths and Strathconas to attack Peloso, but this had to be revised when it became apparent that fresh infantry would be needed.<br/><br/><br/>15 September 1944... Eighth Army designated the Canadian Corps as its pursuit corps and placed the British 4th and 2nd New Zealand divisions, the British 25th Army Tank Brigade, and the 3rd Greek Mountain Brigade. The Canadian Corps was to launch its assault as soon as the rains stopped.<br/><br/><br/>18 September 1944... The situation on the First Canadian Division&rsquo;s front was not so happy. Unlike the British V Corps, the Canadian First Division commander Chris Vokes was unable to offer assurances about getting over the Ausa on the 18th and nothing could be done until San Martino had been recaptured and the first had moved up to the Rimini railway line. Finesse had not worked thus far, thus the Vokes decided to try brute force.<br/><br/><br/>23 September 1944... Intent on debouching into the broad valley of the Po, the First Canadian Corps poured troops and tanks through the Marecchia bridgehead. General Burns had designated three successive rivers as the main objectives of the coming operations, the Fiumicino, the Savio, and the Ronco, twenty-five miles beyond the Marecchia.  <br/>5 December 1944... The First Division was having problems. Despite committing it&rsquo;s reserve unit, the Carleton and York Regiment, the Third Brigade was unable to get beyond the Lamone. By the morning of 4 December, 48-hours after launching its first attacks, the brigade had finally closed up to the river, to find that the Germans had retired behind the blown railway and road bridges.<br/><br/><br/>13 December 1944... The battle for the Naviglio began after dark on Tuesday, 12 December. Four battalions spearheaded the operation. On the right, the Fifth Division sent into action the only two infantry units that had not yet been involved in the fighting, the Princess Louise Dragoons Guards (Plugs) and the Lanark and Renfrew Scottish, while the First Division committed the Carleton and York and, the Hastings and Prince Edward Regiment. It was overcast evening, with a thick mist giving way to drizzle as the troops slogged forward<br/><br/><br/>15 December 1944... While the Fifth Division pushed across the Naviglio and closed up to the Fosso Munio, the First Division staged a series of local attacks to widen its bridgehead for break-out. During the night of 14-15 December, Princess Patricia&rsquo;s Canadian Light Infantry moved over the canal, with the task of driving the Germans out of ancient, walled Bagnacavallo, where many of the enemy counter-attacks had originated.<br/><br/><br/>20 December 1944... There was no let-up. A determined Charles Foulkes met with his Division commanders within hours after the First Brigades failure on the Fosso Vecchio. New plans were drawn up for yet another joint assault between the First and Fifth Divisions that very night. The object was to force the Germans to abandon the S-shaped Fosso Munio and retire behind the Senio and the task was given to two infantry brigades, the Second and Eleventh, both using two-assault battalions.<br/><br/><br/>2 January 1945... The quiet along the Senio was about to be shattered. At either end of the Canadian sector were pockets of German troops and I Corps headquarters had decided to get rid of them before settling down for the winter. On the right, north of Ravenna, the Germans were huddled behind a web of canals and rivers, below the Lago Comacchio along the line extending from the coast to Alfonsine, where it linked up with the Senio defences.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The small 6-scenario pack covers actions from the eastern front of WW II.  Ownership of Advanced Squad Leader and some modules is required.<br/><br/>Here is a description of the scenarios from the Lone Canuck web site:<br/><br/><br/>    1) Borodzatyn, Russia, 22 June 1941: The sounds of incoming artillery heralded the attack of Panzer Division 4, attacking across the Bug River south of Brest-Litovsk. The Grenadiers of Panzer-Grenadier Regiment 33, supported by a platoon of tanks from Panzer Regiment 35, marched eastward along the main road into the town. German panzers duelled with Soviet light tanks, while German grenadiers stormed the heavily defended municipal building&hellip; <br/><br/><br/> <br/> <br/>    2) Bobruysk, Russia, 25 June 1944: The radios of the Soviet Don Tank Corps crackled with the words &ldquo;Storm Five-Five-Five!&rdquo; The all-out offensive against the salient of Army Group Centre had begun. However, east of the Bobruysk Bridge over the Berezina River waited a worthy opponent. The reinforced II/Panzer Regiment 21, Panzer Division 20 was well placed and could be employed against either a northerly or southerly Russian thrust. The battalion was superbly equipped, with about one hundred battle worthy Mark IVs. However, Major Paul Schulze, in command of the regiment, had received no orders... <br/><br/><br/> <br/> <br/>    3) Staryy Bykhov Russia, 4 July 1941: The German Blitzkrieg was still in full swing and Heniz Guderian&rsquo;s Second Panzer Group&rsquo;s spearheads had crossed the Berezina at Bobruysk and Borisov and were now making for the Dnieper. Fortune favours the bold, and Guderian&rsquo;s or Fast Heniz, as he was known as, wanted to cross the Dnieper. Guderian&rsquo;s advanced detachments discovered the Russians had fortified and were strongly holding the principal Dnieper crossings at Rogachev, Mogilev, and Orsha&hellip; <br/><br/><br/> <br/> <br/>    4) Berlin, Germany, 3 May 1945: Despite the Germans&rsquo; pyrrhic victories of Seelow Heights and Diedersdorf, the Red Army broke through the German defences along the Oder River and advanced towards the German capital. On 27 April, Sturmartillerie Brigade 249 successfully broke through the Soviet encircling ring before the Red Army had been able to consolidate its position, and the brigade&rsquo;s assault guns took up positions within the Berlin defensive perimeter&hellip; <br/><br/><br/> <br/> <br/>    5) Northeast of Kharkov Russia, 17 May 1942: The Germans had to eliminate the Soviet bulge on both sides of Izyum, which represented a permanent threat to Kharkov. As the Russians sped forward towards Kharkov, huge supplies stored in warehouses in Kharkov were about to fall into the Russians hands of unimaginable quantities. Timoshenko's northern pincer raged forward towards Kharkov. The Soviets launched the 28th Army with 16 Rifle, and Cavalry Divisions, 3 Armoured Brigade, and 2 Motorized Brigades&hellip; <br/><br/><br/> <br/> <br/>    6) Gorodok Russia, 12 January 1943: The Neva River had been frozen since 7th January. The Russians unleashed from 4500 barrels a hurricane of fire over the German positions. The shell burst and heavy mortar fire was reinforced with the weight of the Red Fleet in the Leningrad harbour. Then across the perfectly flat, snow-covered ice of the Neva, charged in close line abreast, the men of the Soviet 13th Rifle Division. Their objective was the hospital in Gorodok where Leutnant Winacker had set up his command post of his 2nd Company, Engineer Battalion 240, transforming the smouldering block of buildings into a spitfire fortress&hellip; <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "On the heels of the very successful Battlestations Adventure Game, comes a new stand alone game in the Battlestations Universe. Instead of controlling one crew member in adventure style missions you&rsquo;ll be able to play Battlestations: Fleet Actions taking charge of multiple ships and crews. No referee is needed as players battle each other for mission objectives, all the while gaining prestige, leveling up their crews with new ship wide special abilities.<br/><br/>Featured is a new sleek rule set that has all the familiar Battlestations feel, but built for quicker and faster resolution on a massive scale. The familiar power levels in the ships are there with a few minor tweaks. For starters, all ships have unlimited helm power allowing them to perform a number of actions a phase only limited by the number of pilots. As a drawback however, any ship that fails in a piloting maneuver loses the rest of it&rsquo;s actions! Make sure those pilots go last! If you have to turn the ship to fire weapons make sure you make your skill check! Guns and shields work a little differently. The size of your ship determines the power that both guns and shields can have combined. It&rsquo;s up to the player to decide how that power is split. So a size 9 ship has 9 points of power to split between guns and shields. Unlike Battlestations energy levels never drop and there&rsquo;s no more power generation before a round begins. This means there&rsquo;s only ever two times during the course of the game that you have to adjust power levels; if your engines go down or if you transfer power. No more power booking keeping between rounds.<br/><br/>Another new game mechanic is automatic actions. By activating crew some actions happen automatically.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "snippet from the website:<br/><br/>These are W.W.II era Wargames rules using alternate movement and firing. There are limited written orders to enable the command structure, radio links, call of fire etc to be reproduced without slowing the game down.<br/>Limited ammunition is also a feature of the rules, which means players make their shots count, and don't waste time and effort firing at everything in sight like in an arcade game. Coupled with the command structure, artillery and air strikes are called where they are needed most, and not used every turn just because you have them.<br/>Vehicle damage can be cumulative as well as a straight KO, for example a Sherman tank cannot KO a Tiger tank through it's frontal armour at all. The Sherman must get around the side or rear. However there is a remote chance of a lucky hit causing track damage, or a turret jam. The chances are slim, and with limited ammunition are you going to take the chance?<br/><br/>Aircraft, anti-aircraft and air to air combat are covered but extremely simplified to get a quick result as this is a ground battle.<br/><br/>There is an easy to use variable ground scale, so a game can be quickly adapted for a small or large gaming area, or the use of different scale figures.<br/><br/>These rules use a scale where 1 figure represents 1 man and 1 model represents 1 vehicle. Typical 15mm and 20mm scale battles require 50 to 120 figures, and 10 to 20 vehicles with no upper limit. Numbers can be in the 100's if 6mm scale is used.<br/><br/>There is a points system for those who need one.<br/><br/>",

Players start as one of these tribal kingdoms anywhere on this map and compete with each other and with neutral kingdoms to unify Japan, or to build the strongest (winning) kingdom of Wa at least.<br/><br/>The game borrows some mechanics and ideas from Civilization / Advanced Civilization, but there are unrelated mechanics as well, and a lot has been adapted to the smaller spatial scale and to the two/three-player limit. Trade is different, development is different, movement is different, to mention just a few, but still it feels a somewhat similar to Tresham's games that inspired 'Kings of Wa'.<br/><br/>The game is still a prototype. The three-player expansion has not been tested much, and the characteristics of the civilization / advance cards may need further tweaking based on more playtesting.<br/><br/>",

You send out your staff to draft players, sell tickets, build a new stadium or other features, sell sponsorships, buy equipment, hire staff, and even organize a cheerleading staff.  Components consist of 10 blocks per player that represent staff.  A main board--where your staff is placed to perform actions.  A player board--where you keep track of money, wins, equipment, unhired staff etc., A building board, where you place blocks to build luxury suites, sponsored consessions, and stuff like that--this is also where you get victory points.  And also on that building board is where players go to the playoffs, championship, and the big bowl game.  The games goes until one player has placed all 10 blocks (two are already vice presidents and their staff, and you can assign more blocks to represent staff if you can pay them enough)--usually 60-90 minutes.  Wooden tokens with one black side which change depending on block placement determine whether there will be a game (where you need to pay staff and players) and whether there will be a loss (equipment breaks, players get injured).<br/><br/>",

It's not a game man was supposed to grow strong in...&quot;<br/><br/>Those of you who enjoyed the 1975 movie &quot;Rollerball&quot; will want to take a look at this re-creation of the violent future sport ... as a board game. You&rsquo;ll have to use all the speed of the track to overcome your opponents and force your way through to the goal with that heartless steel ball.<br/><br/>Each player manages his team of skaters, catchers and bikers in an effort to score goals with the ball. Each member of the team is represented by a counter (or figure), with vital information recorded on a separate card. The speed of movement is recorded with a sliding clip on the side of the card, and adjusted turn by turn as the figures race around the track. The player must pull order out of chaos as his team struggles with opponents to control the ball and score goals.<br/><br/>The movement of figures is affected by the speed and agility of the figure. Complex manuevers, interactions with opposing figures (such as striking and checking) and handling the ball are resolved with dice rolls. As the game progresses, injuries and fatigue will reduce the effectiveness of the team, and play strategy includes decisions about protecting key figures and targeting particular opponents in this full contact sport.<br/><br/>Playing time is extremely long. This is a simulation game requiring book-keeping and attention to detail. Not for everyone.<br/><br/>Game variants allow modified game constraints such as &quot;no penalties&quot; or changes to the time limit.<br/><br/>Free to download from the files section below.<br/><br/>This is fan work.

European powers had commanded vast tracts of the Pacific region for centuries, and the British Empire remained the largest in history. On the other side of the world, Germany had dominated almost the whole of continental Europe, so the idea of powerful nations taking territory by force was an attractive idea that, today, might seem repugnant.<br/><br/>Despite naval actions in oceans over the globe, it was Japan&rsquo;s entry into the war that truly turned hostilities into a World War. By attacking Pearl Harbour, Japan ensured the United States was put into a position whereby it could no longer remain neutral. No longer was the fighting confined to Europe and Africa, with warships trading blows overseas. Now the people of almost every continent were directly affected by war.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Japan failed in its gamble. Before it fell, however, it had dealt the United States a grievous blow, and all but ended the hold European countries had in the region (not least because they had their own problems back in Europe).

When so much money is at stake, everything is possible. It happens that people help their luck using marked cards or another ace- but cardsharps are not welcome. Don't let them catch you or someone may grab a gun, and then the fastest shot decides rather than the best hand.&quot;<br/><br/>Derringer is a Poker variant where each of the oversized hand card shows one to three Poker cards. Rules follow those of five-card draw Poker, but you have to decide which cards to play. With the 5 hand cards several possible Poker card hands may be built. You play a bid round, a buy round and a second bid round. When it comes to show your hand, you play two hand cards (showing 5 or 6 Poker cards) or as many hand cards as necessary to play exactly 5 Poker cards. Double cards or playing 6 Poker cards counts as card-sharping; in this case other players can decide to play Derringer cards to shoot that player out of this round. Three additional special power cards are in the the deck, allowing special actions.<br/><br/>The game comes in two editions, &quot;Maverick&quot; and &quot;Traveller&quot;. Traveller has the minimum equipment, and the bills are smaller und uncut, but it still comes in a veneer-wooden box. Maverick comes in a splendid wooden case, with larger and fully-cut bills and more Poker chips. Summary cards explain the special power cards and the Poker hand values<br/><br/>",

The Spanish actually declared war first, but no one doubted that the United States was the aggressor; whether said aggression was designed to acquire control over Cuba or liberate the island depended on one&rsquo;s point of view. The small U.S. Regular Army would quickly be joined by tens of thousands of volunteers, who answered the war&rsquo;s signature battle cry &quot;Remember the Maine!&quot; with the less-well-remembered response:<br/><br/>&quot;To Hell with Spain!&quot;<br/><br/>To Hell With Spain is a supplement for the Series: Infantry Attacks (Avalanche Press) series, based on the battles fought in Cuba and Puerto Rico between June and August 1898. It is not a complete game: ownership of any boxed game in the Series: Infantry Attacks (Avalanche Press) series is necessary to provide the rules and markers, and maps are drawn from the following Series: Panzer Grenadier (Avalanche) games and supplements: Elsenborn Ridge, Road to Berlin, Battle of the Bulge, Kokoda Trail, Eastern Front and 1940: The Fall of France. There are 10 scenarios, each based on an actual battle or situation from the Spanish-American War.<br/><br/>To Hell With Spain is sold exclusively via .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game&rsquo;s components.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Zulu, Battle of Isandhlwana&quot; is a game that simulates the battle between British imperial forces and Zulu warriors on January 22nd, 1879 in Zululand, and area northeast of what is today the Republic of South Africa.  This battle is known as the worst disaster suffered by colonial troops in a confrontation against native forces.<br/><br/>This DTP publication by Luis Carre&ntilde;o Joicey, deals with the history of the battle and includes a detailed simulation of the conflict which will help to better understand what happened.<br/><br/>One player plays the with the British side and the other with the Zulu side, if there are two players. Additional players may take command of individual Zulu formations (the &quot;horns&quot;, &quot;chest&quot; and &quot;loins&quot;).<br/><br/>The basic game serves only to as an introduction and to let players familiarize themselves with with the rules; players should use the advanced rules for a more complete game.<br/><br/>",

The Great Father Aleksandr Kerensky led our forefathers, the remnants of the righteous Star League army, away from that chaotic despotism. In turn, his son Nicholas  forged us into the Clans: a society dedicated to becoming the greatest fighting force in all of history. We grew stronger with each generation, awaiting the day when we would return to the Inner Sphere to save it from itself.<br/><br/>Now is the time of the Return. Some among the Clans oppose the Crusaders' campaign of conquest, but we know that true enlightenment can only come to the misguided rabble of the Successor States through total subjugation. We will crush their honorless armies with our OmniMechs and plant the flag of the Clans on sacred Terra. Only then will the true Star League have returned to the Inner Sphere.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>The companion volume to the Field Manual: Warden Clans, this volume follows up on earlier books dedicated to the Clans and gives more detail on the seven Clans identified as being Crusader clans at the time of printing.  More detail is given on the five Clans that hadn't been covered in earlier sourcebook at the time, and with those Clans comes detail on more new equipment, 'Mechs and Battle Armour not seen before in the Inner Sphere.<br/><br/>This sourcebook is out of print, and hasn't been released in electronic format by the current license holder.<br/><br/>",

Fighting had broken out early that morning. Meade had shifted the assorted corps of the Army of the Potomac northward to that town. General Reynolds was reported down. Hancock had the field in hand (he hoped) and Meade was now moving his headquarters to that fateful field. In the few days since being thrust into command of the Army of the Potomac, Meade had gained full control and would now direct it toward what was to be its single most important battle.<br/><br/>Turning back R.E. Lee's second invasion of the North, Meade would end the Southern general's significant offensive capabilities. For the North. it was the beginning of the march which would eventually win the war.&quot;<br/><br/>Scale<br/>Each hex on the game map equals 200 yards of real terrain. Each day-time turn represents 30 minutes, each night turn one hour. The vertical scale between contours is 30 feet.<br/>Infantry and cavalry units are brigades, artillery units usually 16 gun battalions. A strength point of infantry or cavalry is 100 men. A gun point of artillery is roughly 3 cannons.[...]<br/><br/>Orders<br/>Orders are the heart of the main command system of this game series. Players prepare orders in writing as instructions to the corps (generally) as to what they are to do. An order is not a hex by hex record of movement. It is the actual wording in the same form as the historical orders.&quot;<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Thunder at the Crossroads: The Battle of Gettysburg, July 1-3, 1863  (Second Edition)<br/><br/><br/>",

A mix of psychology and strategy helps the story of the defense of the city unfold, all to be decided in epic combat.<br/><br/>Each of the three players acts as an enchanter, preparing his golem for battle. Two of the players are loyal to Ymhet and want to defend it against the invaders, but the other will fight for Bakonia. In the first part of the game, the players prepare their own golems and sabotage the ones belong to those they believe to be their enemies. Once the invasion force arrives, the traitor is revealed and the actual battle for Ymhet begins. If the loyal players destroy the enemy golem and all invading forces, the town remains in their own hands. If any of the invaders or the invading golem breaks through the city walls, they seize control in the name of the empire.<br/><br/>",

The rules recreate the flavor of the period with a minimal amount of complexity. The rules were written with a focus on the period 1740-1815, but can easily be used to re-fight Age of Sail Battles from before and after those dates.<br/><br/>The intent of the rules was to provide for the ability for a single player to use a large number of ships and for the game to be concluded with a clear winner in a single 3 to 4 hour gaming session.<br/><br/>The end product is a balance between the reality and game. It is Warm Work strikes a fair balance between period flavor and ease of play. The system is pretty basic when compared to most rules for the period, but the rules give good solid results that reflect the period.<br/><br/>Available as a PDF (rules and markers).

From now on, at all times during the game the players keep their balls hidden.<br/><br/>A player is selected to be the &quot;master&quot; of the first turn.<br/><br/>In each turn &ndash; at the same time &ndash; players secretly pick one of their balls from their supply and hold it &ndash; hidden in the closed hand &ndash; towards the other players. When all players made their selection, the balls are revealed simultaneously.<br/><br/>Now the colour of the master player&rsquo;s ball determines which player (remember, each player is assigned a colour) must play the ball in their hand first. A ball may be placed on any empty hole of the board or on any 2&times;2 platform. Then in clockwise direction the other two players also place their balls.<br/><br/>Whenever a small 5-ball pyramid is formed, the player whose colour represent the majority (or, if there is no clear majority, the player who owns the top ball) scores 1 point.<br/><br/>The last player of the current turn will then be the master player of the next turn.<br/><br/>End of the Game<br/><br/>When the last ball is played and the point is scored, the game ends. The player with the highest score wins the game.

        "description": "Tactical Second World War game simulating a British battalion attacking a reduced German battalion in 1943-45. Published in the book Simulating War. Components are also available from the author's website. The designer recommends playing with seven players in two teams.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 6x8 hex grid, each hex representing about 150 meters across. Units are platoons, divided into four British companies versus two smaller German companies. The British side also has a machinegun platoon. Both sides are supported by off-map mortars. Terrain tiles are randomly placed before play to make a unique map for each game.<br/><br/>Players take turn moving and firing with all their units. There are limits on cooperation between units from different companies.

        "description": "Originally named &quot;Rosicrucian Chess,&quot; this is a four-handed chess variant that can be played as a game, or used as a divination tool. (The divination version requires the use of a die and an additional piece.) The game was invented in the Victorian era by the adepts of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in England. Despite the existence of extensive original instructions, no surviving manuscript gives perfectly unambiguous rules for play, so different modern authors have published instructions that do not always agree in all details. The first published version was in The Golden Dawn (1941) by Israel Regardie.<br/><br/>There are four different 8x8 boards, corresponding to the classical elements, of which only one is used in a given game session. Setup configuration of the pieces depends on which of the boards is being used, with four further variations possible within that decision. Ordinary game play involves partners seated across from one another, with their opponents at right angles to them: air and fire vs. water and earth. Setup is on the right-hand half of the nearest two rows, so that pawns generate a sort of spiral motion on the board as a whole.<br/><br/>Each player has nine chessmen (4 pawns, knight, queen, bishop, rook, and king), and piece movement varies slightly from standard modern chess, especially in the case of the queen. Pawns are promoted only to the corresponding piece of their native file. Each of the 36 chessmen has a correspondence to a given Egyptian god or goddess, and all of the board squares correspond to letters in the Angelic Tablets of Renaissance magicians John Dee and Edward Kelly.<br/><br/>",

Luckily, you have been equipped with a deck of magical candy to fend them off and claim the treasure for your own.<br/><br/>On your turn, roll dice to create specific combos in order to activate your candies&rsquo; abilities and to accumulate Adventure tokens on a Location. The first player to get the necessary amount of Adventure tokens on a Location wins the Artifact hidden behind it and scores points. But beware the Villains that stand in your way! If there&rsquo;s a Villain at your current Location, he can damage or incapacitate you. If your health falls to zero, you will lose points. If you manage to beat a Villain&rsquo;s health to zero, you will receive Reward cards equal to its level. You only get to keep one Reward card, however, so choose wisely, whether it be extra points or potent power-ups. The first player to reach 15 points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

As the artillery ceased, it was time to take to the beach in what would be the deadliest 76 hours in the entire Pacific Theater of World War II.<br/><br/>Leathernecks &lsquo;43 is a fast-paced dice game which mixes push-your-luck elements with important tactical decisions.  You control a squad of Marines advancing up the beach towards enemy machine gun positions.  Rolling the soldiers on your dice allows them to advance, but you might also roll machine gun fire which slows them down.  Each suppressing fire result pins down one of your soldier dice and if you accumulate three suppressing fires in a single turn, your entire squad is pinned down and none of your soldiers advance!  If you&rsquo;re lucky, you can use smoke grenades to avoid the fire and push your squad up the beach.  Your goal is to assault the bunker, but you also need to outpace your opponent&rsquo;s soldiers!  At the end of the game, you score bonus points if you moved your different soldiers farther than your opponents, so you need to pay attention to what they are doing!<br/><br/>",

Adventurers in the world of Ezrok love their leathers &amp; fur, and various factions of druids are everywhere; some good, some not so good. The following paragraph describes the undertaking that is at the heart of the game:<br/><br/>&quot;The Chest of Seth has found its way into the heartland kingdoms. Fortunately, King Morem has ordered the destruction of this evil relic. Your aim is to oversee Ezrok and his companions as they transport the chest far away from civilization. This task will take you through the Swamps of the Black Dragon, the Hills of Vorkin, and deep into an icy wasteland where the chest must be destroyed in the Eternal Chasm.&quot;<br/><br/>This game uses a tile laying system to move Ezrok and his companions across the different regions toward their goal. The cards are progressively laid face up until nine rows of tiles are created. It is after this point that Ezrok can arrive at the Eternal Chasm to destroy the chest.<br/><br/>The Task of Ezrok includes 108 tile cards which offer a variety of encounters and obstacles. Also included are 8 history cards (enrichment material), 10 miscellaneous cards (playing aids, etc.), a pawn, and all the dice needed for tracking resource points.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, she did nopt take well to the dsicpline and ,eventually was expelled. After a number of years developing her talents in her own way she became a formidable battle mage, much sought after as a mercenary. The Council decided it was better to have her inside throwing balls of fire out, than outside throwing them in. She is now a full member of the Council, much to the chagrin of her former tutors.<br/><br/>Welcome to Hard Mode<br/><br/>Magistra Csenge is a new Hero deck, fully compatible with the base game. It introduces a new mechanic, mana, that makes forcing combinations of cards more critical than ever. She also takes time to develop his deck, making her hard to manage for short Start Phases. She is recommended for experienced Bulwark players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Excerpt from the rulebook:<br/><br/>&quot;Accusation is a card game in which players take on the roles of countries engaged in world events. Players use their country&rsquo;s assets: military, intelligence, economy, diplomacy, and research to influence the outcome of world events and gain victory points to achieve world domination.&quot;<br/><br/>Players simultaneously and anonymously enact &quot;world events&quot; in the form of cards. They then bluff and use different abilities (each costing different sorts of resources) in order to further their agendas and gain victory points while trying to avoid bad reputation and resource loss, both of which make it more difficult to advance one's own agendas as well as accuse others of other actions.<br/><br/>The fast paced, primarily concurrent nature of Accusation makes it a high-intensity game. The only part of a turn in which any waiting occurs is during the turn-based &quot;Accusation Phase&quot; wherein players take turns attempting to call out others for playing cards.<br/><br/>Accusation is modern-themed and comes with 45 unique event cards, but it is designed to be highly extensible. New mechanics, new events, theme elements such as Cold War politics, and many other advances can (and will) be implemented in expansions.<br/><br/>",

Playing &ldquo;ZnajZank&rdquo; makes it unbelievably easy to remember the most important figures, dates, places and objects in Polish modern history.<br/><br/>ZnajZnak - Monte Cassino is an educational game for two players thanks to which memorizing facts about one of the most important battles of World War II comes incredibly easy. You learn while having a great time playing it. Players get to know selected soldiers, unit badges, weapons used in the battle and most important dates. The 133 symbols placed on the game cards were carefully selected to show the Battle of Monte Cassino in a wide international perspective emphasizing the heroic efforts of Polish as well as the allied forces. The manual and game cards are bilingual Polish-English.<br/><br/>ZnajZnak &ndash; Monte Cassino includes 10 cards on each of which 12 different symbols have been placed. Every two cards have a common symbol. Your job is to find and name it as fast as you can. If you don&rsquo;t recognize your symbol flip your card and read the information on the other side. Then place a new card on the table and go on with the game. If you manage to name your symbol you should give your card to the other player. The first player to get rid of all his cards wins.<br/><br/>ZnajZnak Monte Cassino is available in 13 collector&rsquo;s versions labeled with letters from A to N. Every box is a complete game set. You can mix card sets because they always match.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BACKGROUND: Soldiers of Glory is an adventure game for 1-4 Players, where players assume the roles of young Soldiers of Fortune during the 1600s. Each Player creates a Hero Character in search of Wealth, Adventure and Renown. To survive and thrive in a land torn apart by Religious Wars, Intrigue, Piracy and Plague, the Player Heroes must seek employment from a variety of Patrons and perform Assignments such as escorting envoys, participating in Battles, dueling rivals, espionage, political intrigue, rescuing damsels, and assassinations. As your Hero gains experience and renown they can improve their attributes and status.<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE: The Objective of each Player Hero is to Gain as much Renown Points (RP) to become a Nobleman. Game length is determined by the Nobility Title desired: Baron (60RP), Count (80RP) or Duke (100RP). In order to become a Nobleman, the Player Hero must complete Assignments to earn enough RP to purchase the various Titles.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES: Soldiers of Glory features lots and lots of colorful game counters including Swordsmen, Cavaliers, Brigands, Soldiers, Assassins, Nobles, Femmes Fatal, fierce animals, and much more. The game is played on a 6 Sheet Map with Large Hexes and a variety of terrain. Game includes Duels, Skirmishes, Battles, Fortress Assaults, Combat at Sea, Pirates and more.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the Three Musketeers, any Errol Flynn movie, Alatriste, and other swashbuckling tales, this game is for you.<br/><br/>ASSEMBLY TIME: This game, since there are a lot of counters, may take longer than the designer's other games. It took me about 4 hours at industrious pace.<br/><br/>",

The Union sends their most brilliant leaders, ready to hammer out a contract that will mean tranquility and prosperity for years to come.  But as the meetings are about to commence, the Imperium fleet arrives and bombards New Mars to a fine powder, evacuating Imperium leaders just before the destruction.  War immediately erupts in star systems far and near, and the Imperium circles the chaos like a vulture, snatching up planets and enticing new allies to join them.  The Union quickly gathers its forces as princes and vice-presidents take the helm in the sudden power vacuum left from the attack at New Mars. Will they be able to stand against the growing storm that the Imperium commands?<br/><br/>War of the Void pits two teams of players against each other in a struggle to control the galaxy through conquest or diplomacy.  Each player controls his own alien empire, building up a deck of cards unique to his alien faction to perform actions.  Players on the same team complete their turns simultaneously, resulting in action-packed, quick gameplay.<br/><br/>Players must work together to dominate systems by taking control of planets.  Planets can either be conquered, which will increase a player&rsquo;s income, or befriended, which will give the player a special ability.  Players must build up a fleet of ships to defend and attack, choosing from many ship types with unique abilities.<br/><br/>War of the Void is a thematic sequel to Empires of the Void.  It in an entirely new game set in the same universe. The game is for 2-4 players and takes about 90-120 minutes to play. A planned expansion will add components for a 5th and 6th player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Around the time of the Civil War and following, the American West was certainly a wild place.   Although it was sparsely populated, many of the inhabitants were desperate and dangerous.  The West had always been home to large groups of American natives, but now had been receiving various undesirables such as cattle rustlers, gamblers, vigilantes, and banditos.  For the most part, those coming West were hungry for gold and were willing to do just about anything to get it.  Many found it too tiresome trying to get rich panning and digging, and instead found it more convenient to steal or kill for it.  As a consequence, it became the common practice not only for nearly everyone to carry a firearm, but also for nearly everyone to use one.  Needless to say gangs, posses, and gunfights were common parts of every day life.  Anybody with a gun had an opportunity to make a name and gain infamy in the great American West.<br/><br/>It is exactly this setting in which you find yourself in.  You have the option of choosing one of seven notorious gunfighters of the old American West:  Kid Rango, Chief War Wind, Pablo &lsquo;The Pistol&rsquo; Perez, Walter Winston, Raging Arrow, Luther &lsquo;The Lawman&rsquo; Hale, or Little Pancho.  Besides the 7 posse bosses, Gunslinger: Legends of the Dusty Trail also comes with an additional 42 gunfighters.  Each boss and gunfighter comes with their own mugshot and unique battle stats.  With your posse boss, recruit a gang from the various cities to ride out to face your rivals.  Dodge ruthless banditos, determined lawmen, and hostile natives to get to your next gig.  You can knock off the Bank of the Nation, rustle up some cattle, or take on the Union Pacific Railroad.  You can also track down the other gunslingers to collect the bounties on their heads.  The way you stack your posse, the strategy you employ, and knowing when to strike will always give you the edge.  Each boss comes with his own clutch skills that come in handy when the chips are down.  No matter how many times you play, the scenarios are endless and the game never looks the same twice.  The winner is the posse that bags the most gold, even if they end up in pine boxes.<br/><br/>With Gunslinger: Legends of the Dusty Trail, you get three  distinct games in the Gunslinger series.  You get everything you need to play Gunslinger Shootout (arena style combat), Gunslinger Showdown (mano y mano confrontation), and Gunslinger Roundup (recruit your posse, collect the bounties, and get the gold). Anybody can get lucky and be a hero!  It takes one shot in the right spot.<br/><br/>",

The oldest player in the group begins as the &quot;Facilitoaster.&quot;<br/><br/>The Facilitoaster begins the round by drawing a Tone Card, which determines the tone or style of the toast (some examples include &quot;Humor,&quot; &quot;Sincere,&quot; &quot;Tearjerker,&quot; and &quot;Roast&quot;).  All other players respond by submitting a Topic Card, face-down on the table. The Facilitoaster then reads the Topic Cards aloud and chooses the Topic Card that, in his or her opinion, best matches the Tone Card and deserves to be toasted. The player who submitted that Topic Card then delivers a toast and thereby wins a Tone Card for that round.<br/><br/>There are additional competitive aspects of the game. In the event that 2 or more of the same Topic Card is submitted in a round, the Facilitoaster has the option to call for a Toast Off, where the players who submitted the same Topic Card each give a toast. The Facilitoaster will award the Tone Card to the player who gave the best toast.<br/><br/>When the Top That Toast Tone Card is drawn, each player will give a toast based on the Topic Card that is selected by the Facilitoaster. Once all toasts are completed, the Facilitoaster chooses which player is awarded the Tone Card.<br/><br/>After each round, the role of the Facilitoaster rotates around the table. Once a player has won a pre-determined number of Tone Cards, that player wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Upset about the absence of the Russian Pacific Fleet in the BtC countermix? Fret no more. The BtC: Supplements package adds new counters and a new scenario, the East is Red, to your Breaking the Chains game to showcase the capabilities of the Russian Pacific Fleet. BtC: Supplements also adds projected Zumwalt class US destroyers to the mix as well.<br/><br/>Putin called last night. He was upset about the absence of Russian units in the BtC counter mix. He bragged about naval reforms, new missiles, and new ships. My eyes rolled, (he couldn&rsquo;t see that over the phone) but he did make some good points. For example, Russian anti-ship missiles can outrange their U.S. and Chinese counterparts. He explained how missile technology is integral to Russian ship design by citing his aircraft carrier, the Kuznetsov. That CV allocates precious deck space to missile launchers. So, it carries fewer planes, but has an impressive anti-ship missile capability! Indeed, when the Chinese bought the Varyag from Ukraine they covered some of those missile slots to add deck space to support more aircraft. Hence, the Liaoning can carry more aircraft than the Kuznetsov even though those two ships are of the same class. And, Russian submarines are different too. Those Akulas don&rsquo;t carry land attack cruise missiles (no LACM capability), but they have more torpedoes. The man reminded me that one of those boats patrolled the Gulf of Mexico for a full month before we detected it; they are quiet.<br/><br/>So we made new counters to represent Russia&rsquo;s Pacific fleet as it might appear around 2020. WE also added some U.S. units such as the Zumwalt class destroyer; the press expects us to have three of them by 2020. Of course, we're also designing a new scenario, The East is Red, to feature these units in combat around the East China Sea although they can be also be used in the already existing campaign game.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     One scenario: The East is Red<br/>     12 counters (5/8&quot;)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kalypto is a fast-paced easy to learn quick two player card game. With a second copy of the game, you can make a bigger deck to play with more players, but you start with seven cards instead of five.<br/><br/>In Kalypto, players try to eliminate each other using armies of shadows. In the box you get shadows with a strength from 1 to 10 (4 of each number), action cards like seize, extort, rise and devour (4 of each) and one very powerful candle card. To set up, shuffle the deck and deal out five cards to each player and place the deck in the center. Each player chooses at least one shadow and places it face down in front of him, this is the start of Their army. If you run out of cards in your army or hand, you lose the game. You are now ready to battle!<br/><br/>On your turn, you choose two actions to perform between four possibilities: you can draw a card from the deck and add it to your hand, you can summon a shadow from your hand that you add to your army, you can use a power card from your hand and place it in the discard pile or you can choose one of your shadows and an opponent shadow! Reveal both cards and the lowest number is sent in the discard pile. If they are the same, they are both discarded. Each action can only be done once per turn. When you've done two of these actions, your turn ends and the next player begins his turn. There are four action cards that are self explanatory: seize makes you steal one enemy shadow and add it to your army face up; Extort allows you to steal a random card from an enemy and add it to your hand; Rise allows you to draw two cards or make your opponent draw two cards (but be careful! If a player has more than seven cards in his hand, he loses!); And finally, devour allows you to choose 1 card from an enemy hand or army and discard it (which is called the pit). The candle card always matches the power of the shadow it fight, and if a player steal this card, he loses the game! If a player draws more cards than there is in the deck, he loses! Play goes like that until there is a winner.<br/><br/>",

Kusukuma is the result of a student game development class (main game idea by Charel Bintz) under the guidance of Dennis Kirps (teacher) and the help of Christian Kruchten (prototype development). The class itself was originated by professor Carmen Schares.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to push the opponent off the board by cleverly pushing the Kusukuma discs, so that the final player keeps at least one Kusukuma disc of his own on the board. However, as the die determines the colour of the next move, a player might have to push his own disc(s) off the board. The question arises: &ldquo;Who will be left?&rdquo;<br/><br/>PLAY<br/>The active player throws the die and chooses exactly one of the following three moves:<br/><br/>1.    If one of the four colours is cast, the player has to move one of the discs corresponding to the cast colour by exactly one square horizontally or vertically (not diagonally), even if said colour does not correspond to his own! <br/>2.    If the joker is cast, the player can push any disc, his own, his opponent&rsquo;s or even the joker.<br/>3.    If the blank side is cast, the player cannot make a move, and it is the next player&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>END OF GAME AND WINNER<br/>The game is over when:<br/><br/>     there is only one disc or discs of the same colour left on the game-board. The player representing this colour wins.<br/>     there is only the joker left on the game-board. In this case everybody wins.<br/>     in a game of two or three players, there are only neutral discs left on the game-board. In this case there is no winner.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beaver Dam Creek is the fourth game in the Blood Before Richmond series, but the first battle chronologically.<br/><br/>The first major engagement of the Seven Days set the precedent for the fighting that would follow. You have a small contingent of Union soldiers occupying a strong defensive position; Lee's plan calls for multiple divisions to coordinate their assaults so as to outflank and destroy the enemy; one or two divisions do all the fighting, abandoning the plan and settling for costly frontal assaults. At least this time, Stonewall Jackson shows up - sort of, anyway: having just marched from the Valley with orders to attack the Union rear, he hears the fighting and promptly sets up camp instead, because of course he does.<br/><br/>The fourth game in our series goes back to the beginning. Though this battle has relatively few special rules, it's very challenging. It's much harder for the johnnies to activate more than a single division at a time, while the yankees find their line stretched precariously thin...<br/><br/>",

The basic idea common to all versions is that a common pool of facedown tiles are turned faceup one by one and players simultaneously compete to form words using these tiles (for example by calling 'APE' if the letters 'A', P' and 'E' were available in the pool). Points are scored for forming these words, but opponents can steal words by using those tiles to make another word, either on their own (an opponent could steal 'APE' by calling 'PEA') or in combination with common tiles (if 'T' was available in the pool, an opponent could steal 'APE' by calling 'PEAT'). The game ends when no more plays are possible.<br/><br/>Squabble is usually played with the lettered tiles from a Scrabble or Bananagrams set.<br/><br/>",

The game is set in an alternate prehistory where our Human ancestors &ndash; the Early Modern Humans, or Emohs for short &ndash; rub elbows with Neanderthals, Dino sapiens (dinosaur men), Florz (small Emohs), &amp; other species. Dinosaurs, huge mammals, &amp; monsters also roam the Earth, &amp; shamans can use powerful magic.<br/><br/>The game consists of two parts. Part One is 24 pages long; it contains the rules (the core rules are only seven pages long) as well as a guide to the cavemen &amp; creatures that will make up your warband. Warbands include cavemen or dinosaur men who can purchase special abilities, weapons, armor, cavepunk items, &amp; spells. Warbands can also include heroes, dinosaurs, mammals, prehistoric &ldquo;birds&rdquo;, aquatic beasts, &amp; prehistoric monsters.<br/><br/>Part Two contains detailed instructions on how to create your warband. Players can use one of the pre-made warbands provided, or can create their own balanced warbands using a simple point build system. Part Two is 63 pages long &amp; includes templates, more than 100 unit cards, all the tokens you&rsquo;ll need (though it is strongly recommended that you purchase cheap glass beads for the simple &ldquo;stone draw&rdquo; system that&rsquo;s used to resolve actions), a terrain placement guide, &amp; measuring sticks. You supply the cavemen, dinosaurs, &amp; other prehistoric figures, &amp; we'll give you a fun excuse to play with them on a tabletop!<br/><br/>So, stop shaving! Stop bathing!

It appears there are robbers disguised as bankers for months now and are planning to rob the bank today!Will the banker stop the robbers in time, or allow the robbers escape freely with all the hard earned money from the citizens of Greenwick District.Bankers and Robbers is a social and logical deduction card game for 5-8 players, takes up to 30 minutes of game time and is suitable for players age 14 and above.The game is split into 2 phases.<br/><br/>(Phase 1) Each player will be given a character card. Each player will either be playing the role of a banker or a robber.In every game there will only be 2 robbers and the remaining players will all be bankers. Each player will be assigned a number from 1-8 and will take turns taking a number token from the token bag.

        "description": "Rapid advances in cybernetics and robotics have brought about a fundamental shift in the approach to armed conflicts, particularly in tactics and logistics. However, it was the widespread introduction of the Human Interface that triggered a true revolution. The capabilities of cyborg soldiers for endurance, reflexes or pain tolerance far exceeded those of ordinary men. The ability to digitise the consciousness of the most accomplished experts was ground-breaking. The possibility of making a backup copy, as it were, put a new light on the questions of loss of life on missions and potential PTSD. But as life had it, theory and practice went their separate ways. The proper implementation of the Human Interfaces proved highly complicated and above all costly. It also spurred the rapid development of anti-cyborg weaponry, the most lethal of which was combat software, capable of disrupting the functions of a bionic body and, in the worst case scenario, taking total control over it. For politicians and the military loss of command of own soldiers was a nightmare turned into reality. As it turned out, an acceptable one. The benefits of the new technology simply outstripped the dangers by a large margin. That is not to say no contingency was put in place, a plan B was devised, so to speak. The Black Stone Commandos unit was to be such a contingency. A regiment-sized unit for reconnaissance, assault and counter-terrorism, it is employed wherever there is a risk of encountering cyborg soldiers. Its members are fitted with HIs, but their modifications are kept to a minimum in order to lessen the vulnerability to hacking. Thorough candidate selection, drawing on the highest Special Forces standards, harrowing training, and state-of-the-art equipment make for a further edge. The BSC work in small teams, their modus operandi being lightning fast assault aimed at catching the enemy by total surprise. They are also notable for employing hackers using sophisticated combat software. Following a number of spectacular successes, despite complete secrecy, the unit came to be a trump card in political struggle. For some they are a bargaining chip, for others, a valuable asset if expendable...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "RAID 44 (Rapid Action and Investigation Detachment 44) &ndash; was formed as a response to cyborg related crime the ordinary police could not handle. Heavily armed and armored, backed by combat hackers, they are very effective in battling the cyborg crime menace. The team was formed with haste after a few spectacular failures by the police force that resulted in a high victim count. At first taking cue from military shock troops the officers were handed heavy weapons and armor. Gradually the modus operandi changed into something more sophisticated. The utilization of high mobility, combat hackers backup and specialized investigators has shorten reaction time extensively and increased operational flexibility. It was necessary to counter the exponential rise in cyborg related crime. Although covering wide range of tasks RAID 44 remains an elite formation. It is a result of a strict selection process and high equipment cost. Only the best, highly motivated and very intelligent can measure themselves with a foe that has a reaction time of machine and no compunction.<br/><br/>",

Players roll a die to move around Iceland and depending on the spaces they land on they can buy fish plants, go fishing, draw event cards or sell their catch. Event cards are played immediately, but players also have action cards which can be used when needed, usually to wreck havoc amongst the other players. When players buy fish plants (or land on existing ones) they can go fishing, and then sell their catch later. The price depends on the market cards in the center of the board which are changed when players cross the starting space.<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:<br/>Aflakl&oacute; is a revolutionary new Icelandic board game where players compete to expand their fisheries empires by sailing around Iceland, catching and selling fish and taunting each other.

It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board.<br/><br/>Each player must have access to a sufficient number of pieces of their own color. There are two types of pieces: pawns and kings. There's also one special token called button.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA player's group is a set of one or more orthogonally contiguous pieces of that player's color. Pawns and kings can be part of the same group. A portion of a larger group is not a group.<br/><br/>A liberty of a group is an empty point orthogonally adjacent to that group. A group without liberties is said to be surrounded.<br/><br/>A territory is a set of orthogonally contiguous empty points. A portion of a larger territory is not a territory. You own a territory if at least one point in it is adjacent to one of your pieces and no points in it are adjacent to any enemy pieces.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must perform exactly one of the following actions:<br/><br/>a) Take the button, provided that none of the players has taken it before.<br/><br/>b) Pass, provided that the button is already taken.<br/><br/>c) Place a pawn of their color on an empty point such that the number of surrounded groups remains unchanged.<br/><br/>d) Place a king of their color on an empty point such that the number of surrounded enemy groups is increased, and remove all pawns from all such groups. In the resulting position, if there are any surrounded friendly groups, remove all pawns from them as well.<br/><br/>Play stops when both players pass consecutively. At this point, the players may agree which groups, if any, can be removed from the board without changing the scores that would result from continuing the game. If there is such an agreement, the agreed groups are removed, the game ends and the resulting position is used for scoring. If the players don't agree which groups should be removed, play is resumed. In this case, when both players pass consecutively again, the game ends and the current position, without further removals, is used for scoring.<br/><br/>A player's score is the number of empty points in their territories, plus the number of pieces of their color in groups with one or more liberties, plus the number of enemy kings in groups without liberties, plus half a point if they have taken the button, plus the value of komi (see below) in the case of White.<br/><br/>The player with the higher score wins the game.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tKomiThe komi is the whole number of points which is added to White's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesYugo is a Go variant inspired by Mark Steere's Redstone.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     igGameCenter (real-time)<br/><br/><br/>",

The trade conditions dynamically change every turn for every sector.  Players may also spend resources to upgrade their ship and to build mining outposts that passively collect more resources every turn.<br/><br/>Every ship produces 'Powercubes' on every turn.  These 'Powercubes' are then spent to move across the galaxy and then allocated to the players ship systems such as Shields, Weapons or Thrusters.  These are used to protect the player from hazards such as Pirates and other players.<br/><br/>First player to return six units of each resource that their home planet does not produce wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Human players are the best all-round Blood Bowl players in the Old World. They may lack the sheer strength of the Orcs, the agility of the High Elves, the toughness of the Dwarfs, the frenzy of the Dark Elves, or the speed of the Skaven, but they do not suffer any of these players&rsquo; weaknesses either. It is hardly surprising then that humans account for over 50% of all Blood Bowl players &ndash; so long as you include Skeletons, Ghouls and Vampires playing for Undead teams, and mutants playing for Chaos teams!<br/><br/>Expand, enhance, fill out and indeed boost your Human team with this booster pack! It contains 4 resin miniatures &ndash; 2 Blitzers, a Thrower and a Catcher &ndash; each covered in detail and posed dynamically, with all the heroic jawlines and manly stares you would expect from these glorious sportsmen&hellip;<br/><br/>These 4 resin miniatures come as 14 components, and are supplied with 4 32mm Blood Bowl bases. Human team rules can be found in Death Zone Season 1.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Now they want to crawl out from their forsaken wells, spoil the Stormgates and taint the vicinity. All living creatures and plants shall die or become weaker... All movements in their range will be harder and the worst part is - they fear no ordinary hero, but only the Oracle Knights....<br/><br/>... Only a few of them left during the years - not every man is able to bear this burden. Their life is not their own, their cause is the eternal pledge - they are the noble order of the Oracle Knights. Only they posses the secret formula, the power of the ancient spell, which heals the corruption and frightens the Kramplings to death. Their weapons were forged with a magic adjuration able to overcome the aura of the beasts and to destroy them... Eternal secret since the dawn of time...<br/><br/><br/>    NCBC is a collection of mini expansions based on neutral big scale figurines, which are designed to enlarge the immersive Battalia universe, introducing a whole bunch of new strategic possibilities to the players and adding completely new adventure elements to the basically competitive plot. In general they don't belong to any faction (resp. to any player) and can be played in different combinations with the basic game or with the BIG!Expansion. We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity. But you can mix them in totally different combinations, which ensures the long-term replay ability and excitement in this game universe. Normally the NPCs have small complementary rules, which are provided only online on Battalia's home page battalia.eu as high resolution printable PDF files. The miniatures are distributed in small packaging boxes with custom artwork as separate items or possibly in bundles.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "It&rsquo;s spring 1530. More than 30 years have passed since Vasco da Gama found the sea route to India around Africa. By order of the King of Portugal, you embark on a mysterious journey following the famous explorer&rsquo;s trail. If you want to win the monarch&rsquo;s admiration and his favour, you must visit as many overseas ports as you can, bringing home the most valuable cargo. There&rsquo;s only one problem. Some goods go bad really rapidly. This is why you have to store them appropriately in your ship&rsquo;s cargo hold, to make sure most of them stay fresh when they reach the port back in Lisbon. Time to set sail. May the best servant of the King win!<br/><br/>Route to India is a family friendly game (which also has an advanced version of the rules) for 2-4 players in which the participants embark on a journey to India and back. The gameplay is divided into two phases, composed of a number of turns which the players take. In the first phase your ships leave from the port of Rastello. Sailing along, you will be moving your ships to the selected ports or colonies (different types of spaces on the board), purchasing goods for doubloons and placing them in the cargo holds (player boards). During your turn you can take move and trade actions, and each cargo tile you obtain is worth a specific number of points at the end of the game. The last ship that arrives at the port in India starts the second phase, beginning the journey back (with new goods available). The game goes on until all the players&rsquo; ships reach Rastello again, then you count the points and the player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Fortunately for the historical wargaming community, two generals were foolish enough to accept Hannibal's challenge, both names Fulvius, and both on the field before Herdonia. As had occured at Cannae, both these armies were also envelopped and annihilated. Unlike Cannae, at the Herdonia battles Rome fielded only two, not eight, legions.

Game turns represent months, hexes are roughly twenty miles across and Strength Points correspond to approximately 500 men. The player who controls their opponent&rsquo;s capital first or the player with the largest number of city points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>The Roman Player controls the Invading Roman forces attempting to establish &ldquo;New Rome&rdquo; and extend their control over nearby Mesoamerican city states. The Tikal player controls the principle Maya kingdom trying to stop them. Both sides may attempt to conquer or win the allegiance of other Mesoamerican city states that start the game neutral, these include small independent city states as well as larger regional powers.<br/><br/>The game features Leaders who command armies but are also needed to conduct negotiations. Roman fleets and Mesoamerican canoe transports, low levels of transatlantic Roman reinforcements, cities that can be fortified, pillaged or destroyed, slave workers, supply and attrition, cavalry (Roman player only) and human sacrifice (Tikal player only).<br/><br/>By necessity almost all of the forces and characters represented are fictional, however the map is a realistic representation of the actual Mesoamerican terrain and the city states are those that there is evidence for at this time. The game represents the importance of food and river transport to the Maya and the key influence of superstitions and festivals. Celestial markers for the Moon, Venus, Mars and Jupiter are moved on a night sky track causing increasing unrest or even rebellion and changes of allegiance amongst the regional powers and city states, especially when 2 or more markers stack together.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Instead of Combat values, unit's are printed with a Unit Quality Rating and a Movement Allowance. Combat strength is determined randomly based on unit quality, and positioning before an attacking. The result is an original system which focuses like a laser on the unpredictability of cold war-era combat.<br/><br/>The OOB includes a well-researched collection of available divisions and air assets. The Russian OOB is based off the militia which attacked Grozny in 1994. The JNA is accurately represented though assumed to be at full strength. Numerous other Balkan and NATO nations are represented. 1995 focuses more on maneuver and less on chrome as there are no special counters, but lots of units instead.<br/><br/>WEIGHT: 7/10<br/>SOLITAIRE: 9/10<br/>PLAYERS: 1-2<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In a solo game, the player controls all Soldiers while the game system controls the Geno forces; in a two-player game, the control of every Soldier is distributed evenly among players. Optional rules allow an additional player to take control of the Genos for an even higher challenge for the Soldiers player(s).<br/><br/>Four categories of Soldiers are available including the average Privates, the higher-skilled Sergeant, and two specialized units: the Gunner wielding a Heavy Machinegun and the Pyro with his Flamer. Additional equipment such as hand grenades and motion detector-based sights are also available.<br/><br/>Geno opponents exist in only one category. They only have melee attacks, but they make up for it with overwhelming numbers and high speed.<br/><br/>The board is made of square tiles chosen randomly and added to the game as the Soldiers progress in the complex overrun by the Genos. Many of these tiles include special conditions such as various hazards, temporarily blocked paths or even Geno ambushes, but also random items like additional ammo or body armor and other equipment to increase the odds of your Soldiers' survival.<br/><br/>The game ends when surviving Soldiers reach the Exit tile. If all Soldiers get killed by the Genos, the player(s) lose(s).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

To win, have the most Renown by the end of round 5, securing the support of the people.<br/><br/>Whether you like working together, fighting your friends, or playing alone, Alynthia lets you play the way you want while seamlessly transitioning between modes.

        "description": "NUTSO is the most outrageous card game you will ever play. A poker-styled card game designed for the entire family. It's like Texas Hold'em with a twist. Your hand is only as good as the last player's move. Let's just say if you think you have the best hand, you're probably wrong.<br/><br/>Combine your two cards with the five community cards to make the best five card hand. Be the only player left by collecting all the NUTSO bucks.<br/><br/>Each player receives a starting stack of NUTSO bucks totaling $15,000. Determine who will deal the first hand by dealing one card at a time to each player. First player dealt a NUTSO card deals first. The deal then alternates clockwise for the rest of the game unless someone plays the Pass The Button wild card and takes the deal. Helpful card: You can use the dealer card in the deck to keep track of who is dealing.<br/><br/>Before each hand is dealt, all players, except the dealer place $500 NUTSO bucks in the middle. The dealer then gives 2 card to each player and deals 5 cards face down in the middle, these are the community cards. After reviewing the 2 cards in their hands players can either stay in the game by placing the same amount of NUTSO bucks that started the hand or quit the hand. The decision to bet or fold starts with the player left to the dealer. After betting is over the dealer turns over the first 3 of the community card for another round of betting or folding. Each player is trying to build the winning hand using a combination of the 2 player cards and the 5 community cards. Dealer than turns over the fourth card for another round of betting and folding. Final community card is turned over for a final round of betting and folding. The showdown begins when all remaining players will expose their hands and the best hand wins all the NUTSO bucks in the middle. Winning hands look a lot like poker hands.<br/><br/>The real beauty of NUTSO are the wild cards. When played they can take down the strongest hand or turn a losing hand into a winner. Then again if you play one it might ruin your chances of winning. Who knows? That's why this game is called NUTSO.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Although the author is a late convert to the joys of Napoleonic wargaming, he soon began to see why so many wargamers love the period. As a result, he set out to write several sets of rules that would use similar game mechanisms to those in his other PORTABLE WARGAME rules, and that would enable him to fight a range of small, medium, and large battles on a relatively small tabletop. This book is the result.<br/><br/>Please note that all the rules have been designed to be used with a gridded tabletop made up of squares or hexes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At JRK Innovations we&rsquo;ve been innovating for over 10 years. This time around, we&rsquo;ve put our sights on the next best game with the Brownie Points Card Game, an electrifying game with unique elements combined into one challenging, fast, heart-pounding game.<br/><br/>When you see games being played with typical cards, they can be fun, but you&rsquo;ll see after a short period of time people tune out and begin to wonder, what&rsquo;s next. Think about it: how many times have you played a game that just didn&rsquo;t capture your attention?<br/><br/>The brownie points card game is a major tune-up. Here&rsquo;s how we do it:<br/>Central to the brownie points card game is the no hand is safe and every hand can be won or lost. the brownie points slap attack injects a level of competitiveness for all gamers at any level dramatically improving awareness and engagement by all players.<br/><br/>This means two important things: 1) No matter how good or bad you are at games, everyone is on the same playing field. No one can hide from the slap attack.  2) Every player must be alert and watching each hand play. This creates urgency and awareness not typical in other games.<br/><br/>Control the score keeping from the palm of your hand with the free Brownie Points Scorecard that syncs to all your players devices so everyone has a front row seat to the scorecard. With the built-in trends feature, you can instantly see who&rsquo;s trending up or down along with how many trophies you&rsquo;ve earned by winning rounds.<br/><br/>The Scorecard can accommodate small or large groups, so invite the neighborhood, we&rsquo;ve got you covered. And with the friends and worldwide leader boards, you can see how you stack up to the competition.<br/><br/>Got 60 seconds? Here&rsquo;s why the Brownie Points Card Game is different:<br/><br/>    1. Five key elements that change the game on a dime when you never expect it.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>    2. Every player is engaged with the ability to steal each hand or hold of for an even bigger play.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>    3. No hand is safe in this game no matter how hard you try to out-think your opponent.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>    4. One card that makes every player a little nervous as it can take you out of the round.<br/><br/><br/>WHAT IS THIS?<br/><br/>THIS IS A CARD GAME THAT HOLDS NO MERCY<br/><br/>Brownie Points Card Game is a highly strategic, fast pace game full of surprises that you can never plan for. Players take turns drawing cards, Brownie Point Slap Attacking their opponents and earning as many points as possible each round. The deck is made up of cards that let you send all your opponents to the Dog House, a Game Changer that immediately trumps the pile, and a Brownie Squirts Card that can instantly turn all your cards to negative points and take you out of the round.<br/><br/>",

The board starts out empty, with all Element tokens mixed up and spread out around the edges of the board.<br/><br/>Players take turns stacking and stealing element tokens and piles to shift the balance of the elements in their favor. The top element on any pile must match the corner of the board in which the pile is placed, however, as players stack Master tokens and strategically combine piles, even the element with the fewest tokens at the beginning of a round can end up with the largest piles at the end.<br/><br/>Alliances are tentatively made and broken as secret element cards are revealed and concealed, and chaos battles with strategy as each player tries to become the Master of the Elements.<br/><br/>Once the last token is placed, all game-play freezes and the round ends. Players tally up their scores (including bonus points for placing the last token) and reshuffle the cards and tokens to start again! Whoever gains the most points at the end of 4 rounds of play is crowned the winner and Master of the Elements!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In it, players assume the roles of scandal plagued politicians each struggling to deal with their own problems while sabotaging their opponents' efforts to do the same.<br/><br/>The game consists of approx 100 cards, split into 8 general types which are differentiated by color. Some cards can be played alone, others only in combination as part of a larger play. There are also cards which must be played, and a class of cards (scandals) which cannot be played at all. Mechanically, the game uses a traditional turn order structure, but emphasizes cross-play, off-turn, and table-wide cards to keep all players involved throughout a hand.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a hand of 8 cards (9 in a 3 player game) to start. The cards are then separated into playable cards which are held, and scandals which are placed face up in front of the player. At the start of their turn the player draws a card from the deck, and can make a single play. The effects of cards vary but typically involve giving cards to another player or forcing them to draw. In many cases the target of the play can attempt to defend or retaliate with cards of their own, and there are even cards that allow intervention by otherwise uninvolved players. The emphasis on cards being drawn and given rather than discarded leads to escalating plays as the hand continues, and due to the number of cards changing hands, the players' prospects and opportunities change rapidly.<br/><br/>Victory is awarded to the first player to get rid of all their cards, and is determined on a per-hand basis, or across a series of hands using card scoring.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Kalevala and its 50 runes have been translated to over 60 languages, but it's mythological world is still unused as a board game theme. The game mostly focuses in the most well-known tale from Kalevala, the rune regarding the capturing of the legendary artifact called Sampo.<br/><br/>Description: Kalewala: Tale of Sampo puts players in two opposing teams controlling fascinating demi-gods in an immersive narrative set on the epoch of Kalevala. The tense interactions are amplified by the use of a vertical game board separating the two sides and by a clever hidden movement mechanism utilizing magnetic pieces on its central map. Use your limited card resources wisely, as they diminish rapidly, simultaneously revealing information to the opposing side. The earlier decisions during gameplay will bite or reward you on the inevitable event of game's combats!<br/><br/>Victory terms: The side of Vainola tries to reach their home, but only the Sampo-bearer (comparable to the significance of the Ring in LOTR) can win the game by reaching the pre-chosen destination. The other side, Pohjola, aims to deduce their current location from Vainola's movements in order to challenge the Sampo-bearer to combat. The game is played in a maximum of 12 rounds utilizing the trap components of Pohjola as a dynamic timer, with Pohjola winning if the Trap deck gets depleted.<br/><br/>Number of players: 1-6, can be played with up to 12 players with two game copies<br/><br/>Target audience: Players interested in flexible strategies, interaction and thematic tension, prior gaming background isn't mandatory<br/><br/>Level of difficulty: Medium (BGG scale), the rules can be learned in 5-10 minutes before starting and while playing but players need to be analytical or focused during gameplay.<br/><br/>",

The game Four Color Cards (See Sek) appears to be related given the similarities between tricks and valid hands as well as their descent from chess (Xiangqi) cards. <br/>Similar to Mahjong, the goal is to form a complete hand with sets of three or four and a pair, with scoring usually resembling that of Mahjong.<br/><br/>Sets for Xiangqi Mahjong are usually either fashioned from one or two regular Xiangqi sets for 32 and 64 piece sets respectively, or as 56 piece Mahjong-style tiles, with each rank of piece quadrupled ala Mahjong. Specific rulesets vary depending on number of pieces and region, but usually the 32 piece variant can take two to four players, whereas 56 and 64 piece rulesets usually take only four. Two 56 piece sets can be combined with different colored characters to play Four Color Cards or a yet unstandardized four color version of Xiangqi Mahjong which seems to be growing in popularity. Additionally, there are some Mahjong variants that add Xiangqi Mahjong tiles as number-based jokers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The famous trivia game. The questions are about the French History.<br/><br/>There are 1800 questions divided in 6 periods of French history (Prehistory and Antiquity, Middle Ages, Renaissance to the Enlightenmen, XIX century, XX century and surprises.<br/>Each player has a circular playing piece with six pie-shaped holes. The goal of the game is to collect a pie in each color. The colors correspond to different question categories.<br/><br/>The board consists of a circular track with spaces in seven different colors. Six of the colors correspond to question categories while the last color gives a new dice roll. Six spaces along the track are &quot;pie spaces&quot;, and from these there are &quot;spokes&quot; of track leading to the middle of the board.<br/><br/>Players roll a die and move along the track in any direction they like. When a player stops on a color they get a question of the appropriate category. If the player answers a question correctly while on a pie space, they get a pie of that color (assuming they don't already have it). A correct answer on another square allows the player to roll again.<br/><br/>Once the player has one pie in each color, she can move along the spokes to the middle of the board to win the game.<br/><br/>In French.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Slyde is an abstract strategy game for two players. It&rsquo;s a bloodless fight where the goal is to bring together as many pawns as possible.<br/><br/>Each player controls a set of pawns, Black or White. The pawns can appear in two states: fixed or mobile.  At the beginning, the entire 12x12 board is covered in mobile pawns, which alternate in color to create a checker pattern. White starts the game, then players move alternately. During  a move, a player swaps one of his mobile pawns with an adjacent mobile pawn of his opponent. The player&rsquo;s pawn then becomes fixed, but the opponent&rsquo;s pawn does not. Symmetric play can be quite a nuisance, so there&rsquo;s a special rule to discourage it. If a board is in a symmetric position, the next player to move can change the state (mobile/fixed) of any pawn regardless of color instead of doing a standard swap. This does not apply to the first move.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no more legal moves. The player who controls the biggest group (defined by orthogonal connectivity of like-colored pawns) is the winner. If the two biggest groups are equal in size, the second-biggest groups are compared, and so on.<br/><br/>Slyde is the first specimen of a new family of games. In fact, a few designers have already proposed their own interpretations of the same concepts of swapping, fixing and coalescing &ndash; much like there are many variants of Draughts or Chess.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Casualties on both sides numbered in the hundreds of thousands and both sides had resorted to chemical weapons, missile attacks against their opponent&rsquo;s cities, and an escalating air and sea campaign in the Persian Gulf that threatened to bring Super power intervention. The Iranian government felt that an offensive to take the crucial city of Basra, Iraq&rsquo;s only port and primary gateway for shipping out its oil and receiving goods from abroad, could end the war with a victory. Dubbed &ldquo;Karbala 5&rdquo; the Iranians amassed much of their Revolutionary Guard formations supported by new weapons secretly purchased from the &ldquo;Great Satan&rdquo; USA (via the illegal Iran-Contra affair) as well as North Korea. A feint attack north of the battlefield, Karbala 6, by much of the Iranian armored force would tie up Iraq&rsquo;s reserves. The resulting battle for Basra was one of the largest and bloodiest battles fought in the war, with both sides fighting with all they had. In the end the battle for Basra would prove just as indecisive as the larger war, with neither side able to claim a clear victory.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

        "description": "It&rsquo;s the year 3327 and the human race has expanded deep into the solar system. However, supporting civilization on such a large scale uses lots of resources which are in scarce supply!<br/><br/>Powerful, Hyperdriven Rockets piloted by adventurous privateers, such as yourself, compete for the desperately needed and lucrative resources found on the billions of Asteroids in the vast Oort Belt surrounding us.<br/><br/>Gather as much as of each type of Resource you can before the others beat you to them, as you strategically navigate your Rocket through wormholes in deep space. But be careful, this is a highly competitive and cut-throat enterprise. If you&rsquo;re not careful you could get raided by your competitors and lose it all!<br/><br/>Quick and easy to learn, light and fun strategy game.<br/><br/>In clockwise turn order, each player places their Rocket in the center Wormhole of any unoccupied Game Board Tile. They then immediately take all adjacent Resources (orthogonally or diagonally) to their position. Once all Players have set their inital positions and taken their resources, they now must move their Rockets using either their Impulse Engine or Hyperdrive once per turn, then take Resources and/or raid other Player&rsquo;s Rockets if possible from that final position.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last Resource has been taken from the Game Board.<br/><br/>Your Rocket is fast, but has no steering or brakes! Thus, you can only move in one direction (orthogonally or diagonally) and must continue in that direction until you are blocked by an Asteroid, another Rocket or the edge of the Game Board.<br/><br/>Also, wormholes are littered throughout the Oort Cloud. You may choose to pass over or jump through them to another open Wormhole, but must continue your movement (in the same direction) until you are blocked.<br/><br/>Instead of using your Impulse Engine, you may engage your Hyperdrive to jump and stop at any unoccupied space, including Wormholes. However, you may not take any adjacent Resources or raid other Rockets upon arrival at the new location.<br/><br/>In addition to taking Resources from Asteroids, you may also Raid a single Resource from any Rocket(s) your movement ends adjacent to as long as you were not already adjacent to the Rocket(s) you are raiding at the start of your turn.<br/><br/>The game is over when the last Resource is taken from the Game Board. The amount of points you receive is based on how many of each type of Resource you have collected. Thus having all five of a Resource yields 10 points, but having only one scores 0 points. In addition, you also receive a 5 point bonus for each completed set of six your Resources make up.<br/><br/>The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>This is a hand crafted game, made to order with high quality, durable acryllic components.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Then break your alliances when the time is right.<br/><br/>The rider you activate may also benefit from terrain bonuses depending where they are located on the fully modular and reconfigurable race course.<br/><br/>It's important to balance effort and control; the harder you push your riders, the more fatigue they take. But when you allow your opponents to move your riders instead, you get to tag along for free, but you have less control over their positioning.<br/><br/>On the Rivet is not about achieving top spot on the podium (though it helps). Your goal is to manage a team of all-stars, climbers, sprinters and domestiques and finish all of them in as high a position as possible, because time is aggregate: if you sacrifice your team for one rider, it only takes an extra second or two to drag you down the leader board.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Commerce raiding formed a critical part of the strategy for several nations &ndash; Germany&rsquo;s Kriegsmarine almost brought Britain to her knees whilst the US Navy similarly strangled Japan&rsquo;s movement of industrial goods, materials, troops and supplies.<br/><br/>Grouping ships into convoys meant there was more expanse of empty ocean out there &ndash; hopefully raiders would not even find the convoy. It also made escorts more effective, but in the event a convoy was hit by a surface raider, such as a heavy cruiser or battlecruiser, the target would be devastated in short order. Nevertheless, the convoy system helped a great deal. It would fall to the escorting ships to defend them until either a heavy covering force could come up in support or the merchants could make their escape.

Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring famous historical or fictional characters and chooses some of them. Each player's cards are shuffled to form a deck, and this deck of famous names is used for each of the game's three rounds.<br/><br/>In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!<br/><br/>",

The whole game fits on a postcard and there are different postcards for different cities with unique mechanics.<br/><br/>The game runs in 2 phases. In the first phase the heroes try to stop the villain's plans before he becomes too strong. The villain first collects threat markers based on the behaviour of the heroes in the last round and the current scenario. These are distributed to the different plans. Then the Heroes can recharge and use their abilities by forming 2 pairs from 4 dice rolled and taking an action marker with the corresponding number. If the number is no longer available, it cannot be taken. And if no available or already taken number is rolled and the dice cannot be manipulated with the hero's abilities, the hero loses all markers collected in this round. Heroes can decide to end their turn at any time, in which case they may use their markers to prevent the villain's plans, reduce damage or recharge their abilities. Once all heroes have finished their turn, the villain's unresolved plans are handled and his power increases according to the heroes' behaviour.<br/>When all plans have been foiled or the villain has become too strong, it comes to the grand finale, in which the heroes must defeat the villain. The heroes must complete tasks based on the action markers they have placed during the course of the game.<br/><br/>This game was designed during the second corona wave and has several free to download scenarios, to bring some boardgames to everybody during the social distance time. You can also send the postcard with game to your game playing friends and Relatives. You can also support your local game store with this game, as there are several special scenario postcards, which are exclusive available in local game stores.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Of course, myself may sneak fish from other cats and run away. The ultimate goal is to convert the fish to &quot;cash&quot;. You can eat fish, but you can not keep it as food for a long time. But if you can afford it, you can buy it whenever you like, &quot;cat can&quot; or &quot;crispy.&quot; Huh! What? Do cats be interested in money? The proverbs are already old like &quot;cats small-size&quot;. Even now even cats are doing business ... ....<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 5 cards from the deck.

And cards has a number from 0 to 9.<br/><br/>The card issued by the first player becomes &quot;the lead card&quot;, and only the cards that match the color are effectively processed. Cards resolution processes &quot;roles&quot; in descending order of numbers.<br/><br/>These cards are three types of &quot;roles&quot;. &quot;Fish&quot;, &quot;Cat&quot;, and &quot;Money&quot;. If you put out &quot;Fish&quot;, put it in your &quot;Feeding Area&quot;, and if it is &quot;Money&quot;, put it in your &quot;Feeding Area&quot;. To cash. A &quot;cat&quot; can steal a &quot;fish&quot; from the &quot;feeding ground&quot; to its own &quot;feeding ground&quot; or block another player's &quot;cat&quot; who has come to its &quot;feeding ground&quot;. &quot;Cashed fish&quot; cannot be taken by &quot;cats&quot;.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out and all the cards are put out, the person with the most &quot;cashed&quot; money in hand wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

From battling super-powered foes of every size and description to saving New York City more times than he can count, Peter has seen it all. Still, he continues to put everything on the line using his experience, his long list of friends, and sometimes even his longer list of enemies to protect the innocent. Peter Parker is the Amazing Spider-Man, and he wouldn't have it any other way.<br/><br/>Felicia Hardy is a world-renowned cat burglar with the latent ability to manipulate probability, causing her enemies to suffer unpredictable luck. After a chance encounter with Spider-Man, Felicia gave up a life of lawbreaking (well, mostly) to become a crimefighter. Despite an on- again, off-again romance with Spider-Man, she remains one of his closest allies, occasionally even giving up large scores in order to do the right thing. Felicia Hardy is the Black Cat, and the odds have a way of always landing in her favor.<br/><br/>Marvel: Crisis Protocol &ndash; Amazing Spider-Man &amp; Black Cat consists of 2 miniatures, 2 Bases, 2 Character Stat Cards, 3 Team Tactic Cards, and 11 Tokens.<br/><br/>",

That&rsquo;s because it wasn&rsquo;t until an unlucky run-in with an ambitious Necromancer that decidedly average players Franklyn Smyth and Steiner S. Scottward became more than the sum of their parts.<br/><br/>After an illustrious career with his &lsquo;repossessed&rsquo; team, Frank &lsquo;n&rsquo; Stein was chased away from the Blood Bowl pitch after an unfortunate lightning strike sent him into a berserk frenzy, killing four players, a referee, and scores of unlucky bystanders. In a shocking twist, after his hugely popular Cabalvision commercials for Lightningade Electrolyte Drink, fans put down their pitchforks and he now plays for whoever can pay him the most.<br/><br/>As if his huge and powerful frame wasn&rsquo;t good enough at stopping the opposing team dead in their tracks, the big lug&rsquo;s brutal play style often rears its head when an unfortunate soul he&rsquo;s grabbed gets an extra-large kicking.<br/><br/>Combined with Steiner&rsquo;s size and Franklyn&rsquo;s keen tactical mind, Frank &lsquo;n&rsquo; Stein is an extremely dependable rock around which many Blood Bowl teams have been built &ndash; at least the ones able to pay his 250,000 GP fee. The Sylvanian Spotlight and Old World Classic teams that take him on will be glad to know he&rsquo;s sticking around for the long haul, what with the Regeneration and Thick Skull abilities keeping him in the game.<br/><br/>The sky&rsquo;s starting to look a bit cloudy, and I don&rsquo;t want to be around the next time a lightning strike finds him, so it&rsquo;s back to you in the commentary box, Jim and Bob.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It is divided in four scenarios, covering different stages of the battle. Each stage has different objectives, marked by victory points. Supply plays a key role, when planning offensives. While Russians enjoy numerical advantage (at least initially), Germany is well fortified and has access to rail transportation.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>The game is using the WB-95 system, which contains additions related to the time period. This rule-set is the base for WB-48.<br/><br/>Rules available in Polish and English.<br/><br/>Original game description from publishers site:<br/>The 1st Army of General Rennenkampf attacked from the east and the 2nd Army of General Samsonov attacked from the south. The numerical superiority of the Russians seemed be a guarantee of success, but shortages of supply and lack of cooperation between both high commanders led to the complete defeat. The Germans managed to destroy both Russian armies in the separate battles.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Highest Adventure is a solitaire game of exploration set during the 1953 assault on Mount Everest. You will lead a team of seasoned climbers and attempt to be the first to summit the greatest peak on the globe. You will need to wisely equip your expedition with the supplies, choose your climbers and assault teams, map out your route, and then start up the mountain for death or glory.<br/><br/>This is a print-and-play game, with two main decks of cards, some tokens and a series of location cards. Before the game, players will need to carefully select supply cards to give them the best chance at success because the mountain is an unforgiving place that will throw dangerous Encounter Cards at the expedition. Once on their way up the mountain, how well the player balances these cards with the expedition's health, endurance, and strength will define the razor thin margin of success and failure atop Mount Everest.<br/> All components (and some alternatives) are provided in the PNP files. Expect your first expedition to take around 30min, with follow up games lasting around 15-20min. Mount Everest is a dangerous place, so carefully choose your supplies and read the rock face well, and you just might secure the coveted prize of being the first to reach the roof of the world.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Territory and waterfowl cards award victory points and the most victory points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>On your turn, a player can perform one of six actions, acquruing territory, enabling abilities or events.  If none of these can be done, the decks can be shuffled instead.<br/><br/>The game will end after the last wetland territory is revealed from its supply pile then all players play one more round.<br/>Add up the victory points for your wetlands and the waterfowl on the wetlands.

        "description": "Two players each get a conventional 52 card deck of their own, with 2s considered wildcards. Players compare the highest five card poker hand amongst all the cards they've turned up. (If fewer than five, the empty spots are considered worthless cards of a zero rank and no suit.)<br/><br/>Each turn, the player with the lowest hand among their best five cards then gets to either Fold or Take another card.  Folding results in a point for the opponent and all the cards on both sides being discarded.  If instead the player added a new card, hands are compared again. And again, the player with the lowest five card poker hand from the cards exposed gets to either take another card or fold.<br/><br/>When a deck runs out the other player gets a point and can keep playing, and scoring pts till their own deck runs out.  First to six points wins. If both decks run out game ends also, and scores are compared.<br/><br/>",

By collecting and playing production cards with the requisite values for the genre you're aiming for&mdash;and whatever review you're aiming to get&mdash;you complete a production and rake in bucks at the box office. Earn more money than your competition and you win the game!<br/><br/>Players collect and play Production Cards onto productions, in separate horizontal rows on the table in front of them, and can work on up to two at a time. There are four different &quot;roles&quot; for Production Cards: Directors (yellow), Actors (blue), On Set (red), and Post (green). Each card has a numeric cost indicating how many cards you must discard to play it on a production and most have one or more value symbols: afros, blood, boobs, buildings, explosions, fists, wheels, and reels.<br/><br/>A production that contains all four roles can be wrapped (completed) by playing a Genre Card and Review Card onto it. Both cards show a value cost&mdash;met or exceeded with the value symbols on the Production Cards&mdash;and a box office haul for your completed film.<br/><br/>Once a player has wrapped two productions (three in a two-player game), the game ends and box office receipts are totaled and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The castle has been cursed and all of the princesses must get through the enchanted forest and make it to the castle before the last leaf from the tree of life lands on the ground. Work together to help the princesses defeat all the obstacles and make it to the castle before the leaf reaches the ground to break the curse.<br/><br/>In this cooperative game, kids ages 4+ will work together to help move all of the princess heroes across the board and into the castle. Players use their item cards to move a princess onto a matching space on the board. The princesses don&rsquo;t share spaces, so players can get the princesses really moving by playing the same item card twice and jumping over the other princesses. Mixed into the item cards are obstacle cards. These obstacles take time to overcome and when a player draws an obstacle card, the leaf token falls one space closer to the ground. Players must get all of the princess heroes back to the castle before the leaf token reaches the ground and the castle curse cannot be broken.<br/><br/>The bright and colorful image-based gameplay makes Princess Heroes easy to learn and fun to play! Once players know the rules there is no reading required, which makes this a fun way for kids to use basic strategy skills and reduces competition by having the players work together to beat the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players need to work together, accept challenges set by historic leaders and travel all over the South African war landscape to achieve legendary status. These challenges and game mechanics were well researched and based on some of the water-shedding events that changed our country forever.<br/><br/>Players turn their Boer characters into commandos, build on their own unique skills, and are led to collaborate with others to a common goal by accepting challenges ranging from large battlefields, such as Magersfontein and Spioenkop, to secret missions, such as spying on the enemy's operations. These challenges require them to travel across South Africa's war landscape in pursuit of legendary status.<br/><br/>If the players gain enough &quot;hero points&quot; before the war calendar runs out of time, the players win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdoms of Denmark-Norway and Sweden found themselves on opposite sides, and fought several skirmishes in the border areas between the countries. This game deals with the 1814 campaign (a 1808 scenario will be provided later).<br/><br/>The game is a low-complexity wargame, with units representing battalions of infantry (about 350-400 men), batteries of artillery and squadrons of dragoons and cavalry (about 75-100 men). The Swedes have regular cavalry units like hussars, the Norwegians have dragoons and mounted jaegers. The Swedes enjoy better training, better supplies and more fire power, the Norwegians have advantages in mobility and skirmish ability, employing ski troops and light infantry (jaegers/sharpshooters).<br/><br/>The game map uses point-to-point movement and covers the border area between Norway and Sweden from Frederikshald (Halden) to Trondheim. The Swedish objective is to break the Norwegian lines and capture Christiania (Oslo), the border forts, (and perhaps Trondheim if they choose to try. The Norwegian objective is to prevent the Swedes from winning by inflicting enough casualties and delay the Swedes long enough to force negotiations to start.<br/><br/>The game was originally released in 2018 as a zip-lock, hex-based system with a print run of just 100.

Units move and attack, competing to score objective points dependent on the scenario. After four rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>There are three types of dice for attack and defense. If a unit is in an advantageous position they upgrade their dice to a stronger one. If they are in a disadvantageous position for example if they are flanked or exhausted, they would use a weaker dice.<br/><br/>When building their army, players can choose to dragonbond their mighty dragons and generals, making both even more powerful - this comes at a cost. If either unit is killed, both units are lost!<br/><br/>The Wargame is completely modular.  By changing the captain you can change the rules for the unit and the generals impact upon the behaviour for the entire army.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Masqueoca NAC wargames in its project to promote games with a national theme has been kind enough to include in its programme one with a hitherto unpublished and original theme, and as a Canarian designer it is a great satisfaction for me to present it.  Wood against Steel, The Conquest of the Canary Islands. Already the title gives us a small clue of the inequality in weaponry on the sides involved in this war.  The wooden and stone weapons of the Guanches against the iron and steel of the conquerors of the Crown of Castile. But make no mistake, even though it was a very unequal struggle, the conquest of the whole archipelago lasted no less than 94 years, practically a whole century of fighting, precisely in the 15th century, which is enough to show that it was not a military stroll. By way of comparison, the conquest of America took about 40 years. It should be noted that the clash between the indigenous Canary Islanders and the Castilian troops was brutal. <br/>This war involved the Canary aborigines, called Guanches, and the conquistadors, on the one hand sent by the Crown of Castile and on the other sent by the Crown of Portugal. Both kingdoms coveted control of these islands, which were so strategic in their overseas territorial expansion.<br/><br/>It is a wargame for two players, where the Castilians slowly but continuously land on each of the 7 islands through the arrival of ships loaded with conquerors and the Guanches try by all means to stop and expel the newcomers to their earthly paradise. The game is played by secret and simultaneous orders and with the help of two decks of event cards, so the turns are a lot of fun and with variable strategy adapted to the moment.<br/>The battles are resolved on a Battle mat with special rules for mountain regions. There are also naval battles. The Castilian player wins if he has conquered the 7 Canary Islands in the last turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Masqueoca NAC wargames en su proyecto de fomento de juegos con tem&aacute;tica nacional ha tenido a bien incluir en su programa uno con tem&aacute;tica hasta ahora in&eacute;dita y original, y que como dise&ntilde;ador canario es una gran satisfacci&oacute;n para mi presentar.  Madera contra Acero, La Conquista de Canarias. Ya el titulo nos da una peque&ntilde;a pista de la desigualdad en armamento en los bandos implicados en esta guerra.  Las armas de madera y piedra de los guanches contra el hierro y acero de los conquistadores de la Corona de Castilla. Pero que no llame a enga&ntilde;o, aun siendo una lucha muy desigual, la conquista de todo el archipi&eacute;lago dur&oacute; nada menos que 94 a&ntilde;os, pr&aacute;cticamente todo un siglo de combates, precisamente el siglo XV,  ello es un indicador suficiente para entender que aquello no fue un paseo militar. Como comparaci&oacute;n la conquista de America dur&oacute; unos 40 a&ntilde;os. Se hace necesario destacar que el choque entre los ind&iacute;genas canarios y las tropas castellanas fue brutal. <br/>Esta guerra en la que intervinieron los abor&iacute;genes canarios, llamados guanches, y los conquistadores , por un lado enviados por la Corona de Castilla y por otro enviados por la Corona de Portugal. Ya que ambos reinos codiciaban el control de estas islas tan estrat&eacute;gicas en su expansi&oacute;n territorial de ultramar.<br/>Es un wargame para dos jugadores, donde el castellano mediante la llegada lenta pero continua de barcos cargados de conquistadores va desembarcando en cada una de las 7 islas y los guanches intentan por todos los medios frenar y expulsar a los reci&eacute;n llegados a su para&iacute;so terrenal. Se juega mediante ordenes secretas y simultaneas y con la ayuda de dos mazos de cartas de eventos , con lo cual los turnos son muy divertidos y con estrategia variable adaptada al momento. Las batallas se resuelven en un mapa de batalla anexo con reglas especiales para las regiones monta&ntilde;osas. Tambi&eacute;n hay batallas navales.<br/>El jugador castellano ganar&aacute; si en el ultimo turno ha conquistado las 7 islas canarias.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer (Spanish)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction<br/>You and your fellows have reached the city of Memoria, this mythical territory where snatches of memories come back to the mind of those who come in. Unfortunately, only one of you will be allowed to leave the city with his/her &laquo; new &raquo; memories. To be the chosen one, you&rsquo;ll have to tell a memory or a lie while messing up with your companions&rsquo; minds.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to tell a memory based on random pictures. If you don&rsquo;t remember any memory with these pictures, you can still bluff creating a false memory, but try to be convincing! Indeed, to score points when you are the Speaker, you have to mislead the other players (in other words you must make them believe your memory is false when in fact it is true, or true when it is actually false).<br/><br/>ROUND 1<br/>IN THE HEART OF THE CITY<br/>You penetrate the heart of Memoria city. Snatches are springing up everywhere. Choose carefully the ones you&rsquo;ll associate to tell or reinvente your story.<br/>1) Everybody has 90 seconds to remember or to imagine a memory with the six visible cards (you can use your phone timer or leave it up to players to decide when they are ready to tell a memory). You don&rsquo;t have to include the whole six cards to your memory. It is possible to tell a memory using only one card out of the six ones you picked.<br/><br/>2) Once everybody&rsquo;s ready, the older player is designated as the Speaker. Then, he places in front of him and face down his &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card if he&rsquo;s going to lie or his &laquo; Memoria &raquo; card, if he&rsquo;s going to tell the truth. Then, he declares the number of pictures he&rsquo;ll use in his memory and then tells it.<br/><br/>3) Once his memory has been told, each player (beginning with the player who is placed on his left) can ask a question to the Speaker if he wants to, in order to gather more information, or to unsettle him to see how he&rsquo;ll react (If the Speaker&rsquo;s memory is true, he has to answer the questions honestly. If his memory is false, he can tell what he wants).<br/><br/>4) Then, each player has to decide if the Speaker&rsquo;s memory was true or false, placing his Memoria or Bluff card in front of him (His Memoria card if he thinks it was true, his Bluff card, if he thinks it was a lie).<br/><br/>5) Then, beginning with the player placed on the Speaker&rsquo;s left, each player reveals his card, explaining if he wants to, why he believed or not in the Speaker&rsquo;s memory. Then, the Speaker shows his own &laquo; Memoria &raquo; or &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card et gives some details about his story if he wants to.<br/><br/>6) Then, you have to count the points (see the following paragraph &laquo; How to count points &raquo;).<br/><br/>7) Then, the player who was sitting on the Speaker&rsquo;s left becomes the Speaker, and so on and so forth until everybody&rsquo;s been Speaker once.<br/><br/>8) Once the round is over, the 6 used &laquo; Snatch &raquo; cards are discarded.<br/><br/>ROUND 2<br/>ON YOUR WAY BACK<br/>It&rsquo;s time to go back. You and your adventure fellows are about to leave the city of Memoria. Some snatches are still springing but soon, everything will turn back to the way it was before entering the city... However, one of you will have the privilege to keep in mind his new memories. But who ?<br/><br/>1) The Speaker draws the first &laquo; Snatch &raquo; card from the deck and has 45 seconds to remember or imagine a memory linked to this card.<br/><br/>2) He puts his &laquo; Memoria &raquo; or &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card in front of him and tells his memory.<br/><br/>3) The other players use their &laquo; Memoria &raquo; or &laquo; Bluff &raquo; card to decide if the Speaker&rsquo;s memory was true or false. Contrary to the first round, they can&rsquo;t ask him any questions.<br/><br/>4) The Speaker scores 3 points for each player who was wrong about his memory. The other players scores 3 points if they were right about the Speaker&rsquo;s memory.<br/><br/>5) The drawn &laquo; Snatch &raquo; card is discarded and replaced with another one. Then, the player who was sitting on the Speaker&rsquo;s left becomes the Speaker, and so on and so forth until everybody&rsquo;s been Speaker twice during this round.<br/><br/>6) The game is over ! It&rsquo;s time for you and your fellows to leave Memoria city. The one who has the highest score keeps his new memories with him. In case of a tie, don&rsquo;t hesitate to go back to the city to decide who is the worthiest time traveller.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The game is an entertaining and educational journey into the world of maritime history of the Mediterranean and Black Sea during the long nineteenth century, namely from the French Revolution to the World War I as defined by the historian Eric Hobsbawm.<br/><br/>In the game players take on the role of shipowners and must develop their business, upgrade their ships, and adapt their strategies to the changing circumstances caused by external factors. While playing the game, players will explore the universe of maritime trade, they will get a feel for its mechanisms and its historical evolution and they will learn more about:<br/><br/>     The main types of sailing ships and steam ships used in maritime trade.<br/>     The important ports of the Mediterranean and the Black Sea in the nineteenth century.<br/>     The important commodities traded during this period.<br/>     The navigation rules that dictated the way ships sailed back in time. <br/>     The mechanisms of shipping industry like demand, freight rates, insurance, ship repairing etc.<br/>     The external factors that affected shipping industry like wars, epidemics, strikes etc.<br/><br/><br/>Players acting like shipowners seek to overcome their opponents financially. Due to the long number of rounds (120) which coincides with each year from 1790 to 1910, players may choose to start the game at any year and they also may decide to finish it after any number of rounds. An average number of 30 to 40 rounds coincides with approximately two and a half to three hours of play. Thus, the game offers indirectly different scenarios corresponding at different periods (age of sail, 1790-1830, age of early steamships 1840 to 1860 and so on). The winner is determined by the player who possesses more value after counting money, value of ships and value of cargo, minus any loans he/she might owe to the bank.<br/><br/>The players move in the map through the navigation cards, which determine the speed of the ships/pawns, and various events that occur (gales, pirates, shipwrecks, fire). Players seek to sell the carrying cargo, to buy bigger and technologically more advanced vessels and to capture most of the Mediterranean market. In the age of sail period, 1790-1830, they also can buy one or more privateers to capture and convert other players' ships. They have to roll the dice only when they have to determine the demand (high or low) of the ten commodities of the game every five rounds, and when they have to face pirates or privateers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "AWAY TEAM: The Voyages of the Pandora is a game of exploring alien worlds in distant star systems. You command the Pandora, an interstellar survey ship on its voyages of discovery. Each voyage sends Pandora to a different star system where you assemble away teams from the ship&rsquo;s crew and equipment to explore planets, moons and other sites of interest, with the following directives:<br/>- Locate exo-life forms, and document their physiology and behavior;<br/>- Collect exo-DNA, vital to genetic science and human adaptation to life in the stars;<br/>- Identify and survey environments suitable for human settlement and development;<br/>- Search for intelligent life and alien cultures; and if found, establish contact with goodwill;<br/>- Don&rsquo;t get killed.<br/><br/>AWAY TEAM has three modes of play.<br/>- The solitaire campaign game, provides an epic inter-connected narrative experience for one player across seven star systems; providing over 80 hours of play time, exploration, and plot-twists.<br/>- The solitaire star system game provides one player with a repeatable play experience commanding one Pandora voyage to a single star system. You set the experience level of your crew and the danger level of each voyage.<br/>- The 2-player game puts players in command of competing away teams from Pandora in a voyage to a single star system, also a repeatable play experience.<br/><br/>Forty years ago, John Butterfield designed The Voyage of the BSM Pandora, the ground-breaking solitaire paragraph-driven game for SPI. Now John takes his branching narrative game concept into a new dimension with Away Team: The Voyages of the Pandora.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

You can play the game two ways, easiest is collecting 1-8 of any color you find first, or to make it harder, you must find match all your number cards with the color of the number 1 card you picked up first. You can also remove numbers to make the game shorter in playing time.<br/><br/>How to play the game  <br/>1)Place the Token cards to the sides so it is easily reached by all players. This is where used special cards will be placed.<br/><br/>2)Each player takes one My Turn card to keep until they wish to use it at any point in the game. The rest are put to one side.<br/><br/>3)Decide if you are collecting different colors or the same colors of each number.<br/><br/>4)Place all the cards face down on the table, mix them up, and spread them evenly.<br/><br/>5)Anyone goes first by rolling the dice and starts the game. Pass the dice around to the left until someone rolls the BBD a number 6.<br/><br/>6) The player who gets a 6 then starts to pick up cards to try and find a number 1 card, once found the No.2 then the number 2 card, and so on. You must pick up cards in number order. (so if you don&rsquo;t have a 1, you cannot pick up a 2).<br/><br/>7) You can only pick up one card at a time and you must place it back on the table face down if not needed or not next in the sequence required.<br/><br/>8) While one player is searching for number cards, the other players take it in turn to roll the dice to try and get a 6.<br/><br/>9) When another player rolls the BBD a 6, it becomes their turn to search for number cards. The previous player searching for cards has to stop searching and join the other players in rolling the dice.<br/><br/>10) Game continues until one person has aligned numbers 1-8 plus the winner card<br/><br/>Special cards <br/>1) My turn - Use this when you want to jump in the game<br/>2) Steal - Take a card from any other player<br/>3) Bye Bye Dice - If dice is on the table, pick it up and throw it anywhere you want<br/>4) Any Number - This can be used as any number<br/>5) Stop searching - If you pick this up you must stop searching for cards for five seconds<br/>6) 5 Seconds - All rollers of the dice must stop for five seconds<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guadalcanal: The Battle for Henderson Field, 1942-1943 is a two-player Operational level wargame.<br/><br/>Designed by noted wargame designer Mike Nagel, the game is a true homage to the classic Avalon Hill title as the Japanese and American forces fight bitterly for command of this small island in the South Pacific. It was the first American offensive against Japan in the Pacific, and the prize was the airfield at Henderson Field.<br/><br/>This design features 352 die-cut unit counters; two 19&quot; x 27&quot; map sheets; one 16-page rulebook; two player aid cards (one for each player); nine special event cards; and a die, all in an attractive box. There is no bookkeeping involved, as units are two-sided with reduced step-losses on the reverse, and the game features a very ingenious way of handling hidden movement. The introduction of special event cards adds realistic random events to the game, and unique victory conditions encourage players to consider the entire island and not concentrate solely on Henderson Field.<br/><br/>",

Based on the bestselling Deadball: Baseball With Dice, Deadball Junior is lightning fast, easy to learn, and adaptable enough for any kid to make their own. Designed for kids to enjoy with the help of an adult&mdash;at first!&mdash;it does not require reading to play.<br/><br/>Deadball Junior strips baseball to its essence&mdash;hits, runs, and outs&mdash;and builds from there. Each at-bat is resolved with a single roll of the dice, allowing for half hour games between teams from the present, the past, or the child&rsquo;s own boundless imagination. After a few games, a child will know the difference between a single and a double, between a double play and a fielder&rsquo;s choice. They&rsquo;ll know when to bunt and when to steal, how to cheer when they win and pick themselves up when they lose. Most importantly, they&rsquo;ll have  a glimpse of how fun baseball can be&mdash;and that&rsquo;s a joy that will last forever.<br/><br/>- Deadball Junior requires only two dice&mdash;a d20 and a d6, which you can get online or at your local games store. Aside from the dice, this campaign will give you everything you need to play, including:<br/>- The rules: a basic set for new players and advanced rules like defense and base stealing for kids to add as they master the core game.<br/>Instructions for creating basic and advanced players, with Bonus Traits like &ldquo;Speedy Runner&rdquo; or &ldquo;Power Hitter&rdquo; that let the stars stand out.<br/>- A guide for adults that includes advice on teaching the game and, when necessary, losing on purpose.<br/>- Five simple rules for kids to follow: &ldquo;Have fun! Be nice! Make up rules! Winning doesn&rsquo;t matter! Always say, &lsquo;Good game!&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/>- A ten-team international league, the Global Circuit, that features the greatest young players the world has ever seen.<br/>- A beautiful playmat that can be printed in three different sizes.<br/>- All the digital supplements.<br/><br/>Grab the game and start playing today!<br/><br/>",

In the following years, players fund projects to further their mission objectives and provide additional funding for the next program year. Research topics reduce the cost of corresponding projects. Action cards can be played to either help yourself or thwart your competitors. Random events are interspersed in the project deck and affect all players.<br/><br/>5 Years to Mars is card-based with a small board to track mission objective progress.

In order to advance a mission objective, players must work together to fund projects that create sets of mission objective icons. For example, in a five player game to advance your rover mission objective once, you will have to have a set of five cards with mission objective icons. Unlike sets for the competitive game, cards can be used for multiple icon sets.<br/><br/>In the single player game, the goal is also to complete the 8 mission objectives before the end of the five program years. But, some cards are removed from the market after every round so you must plan for the next year.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

At the end of 3 rounds, the player with the most accumulated points is the winner.<br/><br/>In the second game mode, each player receives 7 cards from the deck and wins the round by getting rid of all the cards in the hand. A card from the deck is opened in the center of the play area and, clockwise, players will try to play a card from their hand that has an icon related to the card in the play area. If not, he must draw 1 card from the deck. At the end of 3 rounds, whoever has won the most rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>In the third game mode, each player receives 2 cards from the deck.

The public remains suspicious but accepts the story and moves on. Conspiracy theorists claim the government absconded with alien bodies and technology and hid everything from the people. Both stories are, of course, wrong.&quot;<br/><br/>Use any modern soldier miniatures you'd like for your team, and any kinds of weird creature models for the alien monsters you'll fight.

If you create a healthy ecology you get the perks and powers of that Celestial Body. Each organism card lists what it eats and what it&rsquo;s eaten by. You arrange them with plants on the bottom, predators on top. There is a trade mechanic where you trade with others based on what you need and what they need. It is a race to get 12 victory points and different organisms give different points. There are factor cards that can affect opponents and different strategies such as focusing on one biome, going for perks and bonuses, or attacking other ecologies.<br/>⠀<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Barclay is a two-player game of low/medium complexity about the intelligence war between the Allies and their Abwehr counterparts in the Mediterranean theater in 1942-1943.<br/><br/>With the Axis powers ejected from North Africa, there was debate as to where the Allies might strike next. At Casablanca (January 14-24, 1943), Roosevelt and Churchill agreed the next target: Operation Husky, the invasion of Sicily, would begin July 9 1943 &mdash; but there was a problem. The Axis powers suspected Sicily would be the target, and knew there were deception activities in motion to attempt to mislead them about what they already knew.<br/><br/>On top of this, with Operation Husky already planned for early July, there was little time for Allied intelligence to work with. In these six months, Allied intelligence had to create sufficient disinformation to persuade their intelligence counterparts, the Abwehr, that the primary attack and a suspected secondary attack would be aimed elsewhere within the Mediterranean. This essential intelligence operation was dubbed &quot;Operation Barclay&quot;.<br/><br/>Operation Barclay puts players in the shoes of competing military intelligence directors who are attempting to mask or learn the truth about the Allied invasion plans for 1943. The Abwehr must attempt to learn where the Allies intend to land next. The London Controlling Section (LCS), the core intelligence agency responsible for Allied intelligence, must prevent the Abwehr from discovering the truth.<br/><br/>The LCS player uses a variable set-up, placing tiles face down to establish where amongst the five geo-strategic options in the Mediterranean a primary and a secondary offensive will occur. Over the course of the six game months, the Abwehr player attempts to win sufficient evidence tokens to be able to turn enough of these tiles face-up to reveal where the Allied offensives will come. Every evidence token the LCS player wins prevents another tile from being revealed.<br/><br/>To win evidence tokens, players build hands of five cards to take tricks, similar to poker. While having the best hand will secure two  evidence tokens, correctly betting after each player reveals the first three cards of each hand on who will have the best five-card hand is worth three evidence tokens. Thus, getting and bluffing and seeding disinformation is more important than being lucky with a card draw. In addition, each player competes for another evidence token by having the most raid or reconnaissance icons on their cards.<br/><br/>Further, players have ways to manipulate the decks from which they draw. They may create a double-cross deck, allowing them to leave cards useful to them face down in a deck to draw from when they choose later &mdash; unless the other player takes those cards instead...but perhaps the player who planted those cards was bluffing and hoping the other player would waste their draw on a useless card...<br/><br/>Alternatively, players may draw from their own dedicated deck to augment their hands with unique abilities inspired by historical figures, events, and capabilities. The LCS has access to Ultra &mdash; decrypts of German codes &mdash; but this alone will not be enough if it's not used carefully.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You can expect airdrops, ICOs, NFTs, mining, staking, exchanges, wallets and much more. The game can be played flexibly and can be scheduled in advance or by time cards.<br/><br/>During a turn, the player can take a number of actions. Exchange coins at the specified rate on the DEX (Decentralized Exchange), but also negotiate with other players. Buy and/or sell mining/staking cards or your NFTs. The turn ends when you complete the task on the action field.<br/><br/>The game can be ended flexibly. There are various ways to do this. By agreement after a certain time (e.g. one hour), by agreeing on your own rule (e.g. being the first to get 30 Bitcoins) or by drawing a time card.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is whoever has the most Bitcoins at the end. The altcoins are converted at the last valid exchange rate (exchange rate card).<br/><br/>-description of the publisher<br/><br/>",

With each map, you'll encounter two types of rankings: unusual rankings derived from official studies, and more comical rankings compiled from the responses of 100 people in a survey. To put it simply, you might find yourself trying to guess the TOP3 &quot;countries with the most red hair&quot; and, just after that, the TOP3 &quot;objects that can be sucked&quot;.<br/><br/>Dynamic and hilarious, all players play at the same time. If you don't have the answers, try anyway! A little misunderstanding can go a long way. Bonus rounds add spice to the game and help you decide between the two.<br/><br/>At the end of the 8 rounds, it's time to add up. Who will be the grand champion of the rankings? At Zenagame, we're willing to bet that this title will soon be up for grabs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

Each player has their own villain deck, fate deck, player board, and 3D character.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player moves their character to a different location on their player board, takes one or more of the actions visible on that space (often by playing cards from their hand), then refills their hand to four cards. Cards are allies, items, effects, and conditions. You need to use your cards to fulfill your unique win condition.<br/><br/>One of the actions allows you to choose another player, draw two cards from that player's fate deck, then play one of them on that player's board, covering two of the four action spaces on one of that player's locations. The fate deck contains heroes, items, and effects from that villain's movie, and these cards allow other players to mess with that particular villain.<br/><br/>Villainous: Sugar and Spite is playable on its own, and its characters can also face off against those in the other Disney Villainous games.<br/><br/>",

YOU, the Bomb Busters!<br/><br/>To clear the bomb, you need to collaborate with your team of bomb disposal experts! Using the wires on the tile holder in front of you, try and figure out your teammates&rsquo; wires. Find and cut identical wires, but watch out, if you cut a red wire: BOOM! Use your equipment wisely to meet the varied challenges which get harder and harder.<br/><br/>Tick tock tick tock... Will you figure it out before it&rsquo;s too late?<br/><br/>With 66 missions, there will be:<br/><br/>=&gt; 66 different ways to play depending on your moods (in order, by level of difficulty, favourite configuration&hellip;)<br/>=&gt; 66 challenges to play over and over (even if you already blew your top!)<br/>=&gt; Plenty of tricky bombs which become more and more dangerous (but don&rsquo;t get cut up about it!)<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>There is a set of 48 normal wires numbered 1-12 (4 of each value). Then, you add some yellow and red wires and deal them all to the players.<br/>Each mission is different, but your goal is always the same: go through all 12 numbers without blowing up!<br/>The players place the tiles on their stands and then take turns pointing at each others&rsquo; wires and guessing their values. If the guess is correct, the wires are cut. If not &mdash; the detonator advances!<br/>If you manage to cut all wires without blowing up &mdash; good job, the mission is completed, but if the bomb goes off... Try again!<br/><br/>",

This exciting new box includes its own unique scenario, quests, and bosses to keep players engaged and on their toes. However, the real highlight of Enter the Dragons lies in the addition of outpost tokens. At the beginning of each game, players will place one of these tokens face-down on each outpost on the map. When a hero enters an outpost, the token is revealed, revealing a variety of potential benefits. Outposts may generate extra Eternium, controlling it may earn the player extra Victory Points at the end of the game, or the outpost may provide a burst of inspiration to the heroes, granting them unique and powerful abilities.<br/><br/>Spark of Inspiration<br/><br/>Outpost tokens introduce another new mechanic: Inspiration cards. When a player reveals certain tokens, they may be rewarded with an inspiration card. These cards may not look like much at first glance, but don't let their unassuming appearance fool you. The power of inspiration cards lies in their ability to surprise your opponents. Since your enemies won't know what cards you&rsquo;re holding, you can catch them off guard with unexpected moves. Whether it's healing your hero at a crucial moment, playing an additional card during an epic battle, or teleporting your soldiers across the map, thanks to these cards, gameplay in Fields of Eternia becomes even less predictable and even more challenging! We can't wait for you to try out these new tools and see how they change the course of your battles.<br/><br/>",

By the end of the Great Patriotic War, 5.1 million Soviet soldiers would have been killed in action, and another 1.1 million died of wounds suffered in combat.<br/><br/>Yet it was the Soviet soldier who raised the hammer and sickle over the ruins of the enemy capital. The Red Army remained in the field despite massive losses, refusing to admit defeat until Berlin lay at their feet and Adolf Hitler's murderous Thousand Year Reich had been destroyed.<br/><br/>Workers &amp; Peasants is a 64-page book supplement for the Panzer Grenadier series based on the battles of 1941 and 1942, when the Soviet Union appeared on the verge of defeat. There are 20 scenarios, or separate game situations, most of them much larger than those found in our Eastern Front or Road to Berlin boxed games.<br/><br/>There are also the background articles you've come to expect from an Avalanche Press book, this time focused on the Red Army's troops, weapons and organization. It's the perfect companion piece to our most popular Panzer Grenadier game, the huge Eastern Front Deluxe Edition.<br/><br/>This is not a stand-alone game; ownership of any Eastern Front Deluxe Edition is required to play some of the scenarios and Road to Berlin, Sinister Forces, Elsenborn Ridge and Battle of the Bulge to play all of them.<br/><br/>(text from Manufacturer's homepage)<br/> <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Miniature wargame rules for Infantry Action in Vietnam 1965 - 1968.<br/>Charlie Company is designed to serve as an ongoing miniatures campaign game which reflects those peculiar circumstances that were a part of Infantry Combat in Vietnam.  As such the rules are designed to focus on the Infantry Company and its supporting arms, and not on Special Forces, Riverine or Armored Cavalry actions.  As a game system it can be played with anywhere from 3 players to as many as 20, with one person serving as umpire and being responsible for setting up and running the game.<br/><br/>Players take the role of a Company Commander, Lieutenant, or Sergeant in the US armed forces; the GM controls the VC and NVA. The players start off green and continue their &ldquo;Tour of Duty&rdquo; through scenarios and gain experience. Eventually, if they are lucky and skillful, they will become seasoned veterans. The game expects the players to complete 12 of these missions before their tour of duty has ended.<br/><br/>The book provides an overview of the Vietnam War and how the various militaries were comprised. Players may play Marines or the US Army and each is historically equipped. South Vietnamese units may be used as auxiliary forces as well as Ruff Puff&rsquo;s, the CIDG, the Australians, the Koreans, and American engineers/special forces/LRRP teams. Terrain includes open, brush, elephant grass, forest, dense forest, jungle, rubber plantations, rivers and streams, swamp, villages, urban combat, bunkers and entrenchments, tunnels, rice paddies, hills, gullies, canals, roads, trails, and paths. Rules for booby traps like pungi stakes, claymores, etc. are also given. Helicopter assaults and air support rules (fire for effect, napalm, strafing, are in addition to all the typical infantry maneuvers usually found in miniatures wargames like direct fire, charging, grenades, sniping, forward observers, indirect fire, artillery, etc. Also includes rules for night vision, sappers, flamethrowers, engineers, riverine operations, beehive rounds, and prisoners. There is also a glossary of military jargon and a bibliography of suggested books to give Game Masters ideas for more scenarios.<br/><br/>",

On its debut combat, the Focke-Wulf was superior to the Spitfire V, which happened to be the Allies main plane at the time, in almost every way.

        "description": "Your new awareness emerges all at once. You know immediately, before you even recognize your own existence, an all-consuming hunger. Hunger and also&hellip;. fear? Because somehow you know, you are not alone. Beneath these immediate drives lies something deeper, a spark, a joy, a hope. The glee, the audacity to split, to drive a wedge in your very self and become two. And through two, infinity.<br/><br/><br/>ORGANISM is a game of growth, multiplication, and struggle for 1-6 players. Wielding the simple actions of EAT / GROW / MOVE / CIRCULATE the minimal ruleset is maximally integrated and generates a tight yet boundless decision space. Amplified by a set of mutation cards which expand the rules in countless subtle and not-so-subtle ways, it is really a family of related games in a single box that can never be truly exhausted.<br/><br/>Each player controls an Organism composed of three elements: EAT, MOVE, and GROW. In the beginning, each organism contains one of each element, which is a requirement for your organism to live. If an organism lacks one of these three elements at the end of the turn, it dies.<br/><br/>Players take turns either eating food, moving into new positions (possibly coming into contact with other organisms or even dividing into separate organisms), growing new elements, or circulating food within their organism. When any elements of opposing organisms meet, the conflict is resolved by removing one or more elements from the board. You win the game if you capture a certain number of the opposing player&rsquo;s elements (or just eliminate them entirely from the board), or if you attain three separate organisms at the end of your turn, in which case they are well on their way to spreading across the globe.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You play as a unique character with your own character traits including a minor, major and super combo. You'll need them to fight off the zombies move closer to you every round. You run from location to location, searching for weapons and survivors in a desperate attempt to stay alive. Survivors may bring new skills to help you in your desperate fight for survival, or in some cases, new challenges to overcome. You'll also need them along if you want to win as every survivor provides you victory points.<br/><br/>This streamlined version removes several decks from the original game, including the Fleeing deck and Event deck. Players rolls six dice instead of five and there are now different combos to mitigate against tough zombie-filled rolls. Additionally, players can now use followers to soak damage coming in from zombies.<br/><br/>The game ends either when one player dies, the Town Line comes out of the locations deck, or when the Mutant Zombie has been put down once and for all.

        "description": "Subtitled The Seven Years War in North America, this game covers what those in the USA call the French and Indian War.<br/><br/>The 72-page booklet contains a lot of historical background, discussions of geography, tactics, uniforms, flags, and two different sets of miniatures rules, 11 detailed scenarios (with maps, starting forces setups, terrain, etc.), and a campaign game called &quot;Wolfe and Montcalm.&quot;  The latter includes not only rules, but a page of counters to photocopy and glue to cardstock as well as an 11&quot;x17&quot; map (~A3 size) with point-to-point movement to move the counters on.<br/><br/>One set of miniatures rules is called Battle Scale (each figure = 50 men), and the other Skirmish Scale (1 figure = 1-5 men).  Rules are given for movement, morale, ranged fire, melee combat, Indians, Rangers, European Line troops, local militia, ambush, etc.<br/><br/>Leaders are handled extremely well in this game. Each leader is rated as one of Brilliant, Efficient, Plodding or Buffoon(!). Ordinary playing cards are used to determine a number of actions each leader may initiate. Cards used include Aces (one action), 2s and 3s (2 and 3 actions, of course) and Jokers (2 actions and reshuffle). A Buffoon's deck has only one &quot;3&quot; card in it, but four aces, while a Brilliant Leader's is the opposite.<br/><br/>Scenarios include both Battle Scale and Skirmish Scale settings.  Braddock's Defeat, Battle for Lake George, a raid by Rogers' Rangers, Scaling the Heights of Abraham at Quebec City, and many more, are all represented.<br/><br/>The campaign game can be played as a separate wargame, or used to generate Battle Scale miniatures games, as you wish.  Rules are provided for the counters if you don't wish to take the battles to the miniatures table.<br/><br/>All in all, a fine and informative set of rules.<br/><br/>",

Each player also has 4 dice to determine movement. The game board (A2 size) is a 40 field long, 4 line wide oval track. The fields are in 4 different colors. Each cyclist also has a base under it's pawn (in the shape of a cyclist). The shapes are also in 4 different colors, matching the colors on the fields. Two different sets of rules are available so far. The basic rules are made by Anki Toner who also designed this game, the more advanced rules were made by Ludo Nauws from Belgium, in this variant the game is turned into an elimination race on which the last rider on each lap is eliminated.
