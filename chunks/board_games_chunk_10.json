        "description": "La Bataille d'Espagnol-Talavera is a simulation of the culminating battle of Wellsley's 1809 counter-offensive. The radically different English and Spanish armies are pitted against the corps of King Joseph Napoleon's multi-national Armee de Espagne.<br/>Played on four 17&quot;x22&quot; period style maps over which a hexagonal grid has been laid. Each hexagon represents an area approximately 100 meters across. The armies which fought on this ground are represented by over 700 multi-colored playing pieces. Infantry are in regimental or battalion organization. Cavalry are shown as regiments. Artillery is deployed by battery. Distinctions are made between line or light infantry, guard and other elite forces. Various leaders are also portrayed.<br/>Each unit is individually rated according to its number of men or guns, its morale, its ability to initiate combat though gunfire or m&ecirc;l&eacute;e, its movement and, where appropriate, its range.<br/>The game is ideal for solitary study or team play. Each turn is twenty minutes of real and simulated time, play balance depends entirely on the skill of the players.<br/>The rules are a revision of the award-winning system developed by the Marshal Enterprises Household and cover the full range of features characteristic of the Napoleonic Battlefield. A special rulebook provides regulations particular to the Spanish Campaign of 1809, and a historical narrative completes the perspective of events on July 27-28 of that year.<br/><br/>scale = 100 m/hex; <br/>time = 20 min/GT; <br/>strength = 50-100 men/SP (Regimental/Brigade Size)<br/><br/>",

The strengths and weaknesses of the German and Allied units involved are accurately and playably duplicated by forty-nine data cards that display all information needed to move and fight. The system easily incorporates myriad details such as armor thicknesses at various points, shots from various angles, heights, and altitudes, and the effects of terrain. The rules cover the important aspects of small unit tactics - armor piercing shots, small arms fire, artillery barrages, air support, communications, gun depression, mines, barbed wire, pillboxes, smoke, and much more. The game system is shared with our earlier popular Panzer and &quot;88&quot; games, and the rules and components in all three games are compatible. The types of units include counters for infantry, anti-tanks guns, Panthers, Tigers, Armored Cars, Half-Tracks, Churchills, Shermans, Tank Destroyers, and much, much more.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Across The Narva: The Soviet Assault on Estonia, February 1944 simulates the continuation of the Leningrad&ndash;Novgorod Offensive of January 1944, the Soviet Estonian operation pushed the front westward to the Narva River, aiming to thrust deep into Estonia. Stalin's main strategic goal was a quick recovery of Estonia as a base for air and seaborne attacks against Finland and an invasion of East Prussia. The German answer was a stout defence for the possession of the strategically important Narva Isthmus. Across The Narva is a board game depicting this event in time. The Soviet units established a number of bridgeheads on the opposite bank of the river in February. Subsequent attempts failed to expand their toehold. German counter attacks annihilated the bridgeheads to the north of Narva and reduced the bridgehead south of the town, stabilizing the front until July 1944.<br/> Across The Narva covers the first three months of the Narva Bridgehead campaign and utilizes the same system of command activation chit-pull and base rules as in Königsberg: The Soviet Attack on East Prussia, 1945 also by Revolution Games (II).<br/><br/>Across The Narva is a reimplementation of Army Group Narwa previously produced by Three Crowns Games.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: .8 miles / 1.3 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 12-page Across the Narva rulebook<br/>One dual-side printed Cover Sheet/Players Aid Card<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>Note: Players will need to supply one 6-sided die for play.<br/><br/>",

Each player equips fleets with escort ships and upgrades and uses them to control star systems for VPs. Diplomatic leverage, cunning, and brute force will determine the victor.<br/><br/>Each round in Fleets: The Pleiad Conflict consists of six phases:<br/><br/>1) Player order. Every round has a new randomized player order. Being first has its pros and cons, so does being last.<br/><br/>2) Build. The players take turn buying new fleets, escort ships, and upgrades, using their megacredits. The fleets each consist of a flagship and space for some combinations of escort ships and upgrade cards. Which fleet you choose and how you develop it will determine its strengths and weaknesses.<br/><br/>3) Deployment. The players place their fleets at the different systems they want to control.<br/><br/>4) Diplomacy. Players take turns using diplomatic actions. There are 2 basic actions: A) Use 2 diplomatic points to retreat your fleet from the board. B) Use 6 diplomatic points to retreat an opposing fleet from a system where you have a fleet. There are also diplomatic actions on some fleets, systems, and action cards.<br/><br/>5) Battle. At every system with more than one fleet there will be a battle where every ship gets to shoot once. Each fleet has different initiative numbers for its ships, describing when they get to act. Late ships risk being shot down before they have a chance to fire. During battle, players can also use battle actions on action cards, upgrade cards, fleets, and escort ships. Most battle actions cost energy from the fleet. If a flagship is destroyed, its owner must immediately retreat all surviving escort ships from that battle and discard the fleet.<br/><br/>6) Reward. Players get 1 VP for each system they have to themselves (The first player to reach 7 VP is the winner.). Then each fleet gets energy from its reactor and resources from the system where they are located. Then each player gets 2 diplomatic points, 6 megacredits, and an action card, and then the next round can begin.<br/><br/>",

You can look at all the rules on cards in front of you, but you cannot communicate to others what those rules are. You cannot change the order of cards in front of you.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must swap one of their cards (following that card's rule) with another player's card, then someone records that move on a chart. Blanks are considered to be 0 and an even number for the purpose of swaps. When one of your cards is swapped, you can look at the rule on the card you receive. You can suggest moves to others or ask questions of them, and they can respond with &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answers as long as they don't identify the rule on any of their cards.<br/><br/>If you place all the numbers in numerical order (disregarding blanks) in either clockwise or counterclockwise order before you would need to make a 25th move, you all win the game. Your team's score is &quot;Great&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;Horrible&quot;, etc. based on how many moves it took you to win. If you don't win, then you must all be worse than horrible, which is very bad indeed.<br/><br/>In the game's expert mode, you cannot speak at all and you cannot undo a player's swap on your next turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The third in the Lords of War: Fantasy Battles series from Black Box Games, Lords of War: Templars versus Undead is a dual-deck strategic card game for two-plus players. Like its award-winning predecessors Lords of War: Orcs versus Dwarves and Lords of War: Elves versus Lizardmen, the game sees fantasy races engage in dynamic tactical card battles, with the armies in this set having more heavy defense and the series&rsquo; first moving units.<br/><br/>During Lords of War battles, players use hands of six cards (called units) drawn from their army deck of 36 cards. A player turn starts with one card placed onto a gridded board. With the exception of ranged and spear units, cards must be placed adjacent to an enemy unit. An elimination phase follows in which you check for the elimination of opposing cards and the one you just placed. Cards have unique formations of attack arrows on their edges and corners signifying which adjacent cards they attack once played and the damage they will do. Each card also has a defense value which when exceeded by opposing cards sees that card defeated. Once combat has been resolved, the player can then either draw a new card from his army deck or retrieve a unit from the board that has not engaged in combat during that turn.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player has eliminated twenty units or four commanders.<br/><br/>The game is playable out of the box and contains two complete armies: the Templars and the Undead. These factions are differentiated by their unique cards and strategies; the Templar faction is based around a heavily armoured infantry and mobile palisades. The Undead army contains a stark range of defensive and offensive units, including zombies which roam across the battlefield.<br/><br/>Templars versus Undead is compatible with both Elves versus Lizardmen and Orcs versus Dwarves, meaning that all the Lords of War armies can be used to battle one another. The armies can also be blended together, using a strict ranking system, to create mercenary decks for tournament play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On June 6th, 1942, Erich von Manstein&rsquo;s 11th Army began its last assault on the besieged Soviet fortress of Sevastopol, the latest episode in the German conquest of the Crimean Peninsula, which was initiated in September 1941. The operation, code named St&ouml;rfang, was also the prelude to the German summer offensive of 1942, freeing the troops committed in Crimea for other tasks and securing the southern flank of the attacking armies towards the Volga.<br/><br/>Von Manstein&rsquo;s Triumph is a game for two players that simulate the final assault on the fortress&ndash;port. This is a card driven game (symbolizing orders, historical events and equipment) in which both players maneuver their forces, made up of wooden blocks, over the Map Board, which depicts the battlefield divided into areas for positioning and movement purposes. Key to victory is the control of Victory Point areas, which represent the critical points of the defense.<br/><br/>Victory is determined at the end of the game with the player having most Victory Points (VPs) being the winner. VPs are printed on the Map Board inside the red banners. A player controls the VPs printed in an area if that player controls the area. Initially all VPs are controlled by the Soviet player, so the Axis player has to attack the areas containing them to gain VPs. The Axis player loses VPs when receiving reinforcements. If both players have exactly the same number of VPs at the end of the game then this results in a draw.<br/><br/>One player takes the role of the German Commander in Chief of the 11th Army (Erich von Manstein) and has to take key locations in the Fortress-city of Sevastopol, defended by the Soviet Independent Coastal Army (commanded by Ivan Efimovich Petrov).<br/><br/>As the attacker you will have to plan carefully your assaults to maximize the damage you inflict of the sizable Soviet forces. The battle, initially, will be a meat grinder of attrition, be careful of earlier penetrations into the Soviet defenses as they are very able to counterattack... So, you have to thin out the Soviet defenders to prepare the way for a breakout and a battle of exploitation that will led you to the Victory Point sites.<br/><br/>As the Soviet player you have to trade men for time. Your main weapon is numbers and the field and permanent fortifications of the outer ring around the fortress. So, you have to contest every inch of ground and slowly give up positions to make the German run out of time: Hitler is watching and he needs troops and assets to begin his Fall Blau summer offensive...<br/><br/>Will you run out of time as assaulting German or will you be able to take the Fortress in time...? It is a race against the clock.<br/><br/>Cards allow players to make troops move, assault, counterattack during the enemy player-turn, influence the combats and make air and artillery bombardments. Romanian troops and Mountain troops will be present as well as the &quot;elite&quot; Soviet Naval Infantry brigades, so often used for counterattacks and shoring up breaches in the line... Even an NKVD regiment with extra motivation for not give up their positions.<br/><br/>MAIN CHARACTERISTICS<br/><br/>&bull; It only takes 2 hours to recreate this desperate struggle.<br/>&bull; Players have to fight not only against each other but also against the time.<br/>&bull; Simple rules and card driven game.<br/>&bull; The game components are of the highest quality, highlighting the 2x2 cm wooden blocks, the cards and the board.<br/>&bull; Historical accuracy. Includes a playbook that provides designer's notes, historical commentary and example of play<br/><br/>-description from Publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Last Battle: Ie Shima, 1945 is a two-player game that simulates Operation Indispensable, the American invasion of the Japanese island of Ie Shima (Iejima or 伊江 島), April 16 to 21, 1945.<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iejima\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iejima</a><br/><br/>The American player has plenty of well-trained infantry at their disposal.  What they do not have in abundance is time.  The island and its vital airfields must be conquered quickly to allow the 77th Infantry Division to be transferred to Okinawa as soon as possible.  Even so the American side must achieve its mission with no more than a modest number of casualties otherwise the 77th will be in no condition to relieve the 96th Infantry Division on Okinawa as it did historically.  An economy of force approach must be adopted and assets such as air power, armor, artillery, and the American Navy all used to maximum efficiency.<br/><br/>The Japanese player has a mixed bag of forces ranging from regular army units to airfield construction personnel to island civilians.  Defeating the invasion at the landing beaches isn&rsquo;t the goal so much as making the invaders pay as high a price as possible.  With this in mind the Japanese player must focus their defense on the best terrain&mdash;primarily Mount Gusuku and the urban areas adjacent to it&mdash;but always be on the lookout for opportunities to upset the American timetable with judicious placement of machine gun nests and pockets of civilian resistance behind American lines.  The island&rsquo;s artillery possesses the capability to inflict attritional losses on the invaders, and the threat of a kamikaze attack on the 5th Fleet is something the American player must account for.  The arrival of night each turn opens the door for small Japanese assaults which, along with satchel charges, might produce a local victory as happened historically at Bloody Ridge, or at the very least see the American player surrendering control of the advantage marker to demand a reroll.  Changes in the weather are random, but the arrival of rain benefits the Japanese side, as does the appearance of rubble in urban areas.<br/><br/>An optional rule allows players to experience the uplifting presence of Ernie Pyle being close to the front and the leadership provided by Major Igawa personally joining the combat, though at the risk of seeing these historical figures killed in action.<br/><br/>Game components: one cover sheet, one 22&rdquo;x17&rdquo; unmounted map, one countersheet of &frac12;&rdquo; counters, and a rulebook; all in a bag.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(From the rear of the box:)<br/><br/>The road to the Rhine, and beyond to Berlin, seemed wide open in the early fall of 1944. The German armies in France had ceased being organized formations and were streaming back to the Reich in willy nilly fashion, hotly pursued by the Western Allied armies as they dashed through Paris and to the borders of Germany. The First US Army (with the Ninth later on), hit the Westwall on September 12th and was destined to slog through the mud and rain for months against the fortifications and surprisingly resilient German reserves hurriedly thrown against them in a desperate bid to keep the American army off as much German soil as possible. Additionally, lack of supply served to further restrain the American advance. Would the war be over by Christmas, or would the Germans pull off a second &ldquo;Miracle of the Marne&rdquo; and hold long enough to launch a counteroffensive in the west ?<br/><br/><br/>(from Decision Games website:)<br/><br/>HURTGEN: Hell&rsquo;s Forest is a grand-tactical simulation of that enormous campaign. The 2,240 counters in the game represent almost every formation, at company and battalion levels, which fought in the battle, including US, German, British, and even Belgian units. Infantry, armor, anti-tank, reconnaissance, engineer, assault gun, howitzer, rocket, parachute, ranger, glider, and headquarters units are all fully represented in the counter-mix. The two map sections are an accurate representation of the battle area and were compiled from 1944 German staff maps and 1943-1944 US Army map sources. The area portrayed shows all primary and secondary roads, trails and other types of terrain in relation to their suitability for armor and infantry, along with all the villages, towns and  cities that proved to be the bastions of the German defense, as well as every creek and river that couldn't be crossed by wheeled vehicles without a bridge.<br/><br/>THERE are three main scenarios representing each of the offensive periods of September, October and November. A smaller learning scenario depicts the US 28th Infantry Division&rsquo;s ordeal as it attempted to drive on the Roer River dams through the forest of the area. Players may also play continuously from September to the first week of December (almost 300 game turns!). The big challenge for the allied player is to see if he can reach the Rhine River months ahead of the actual date, and shorten the war considerably. Extensive supply, weather and air power rules are included.<br/><br/>THIS latest edition of the Grand Operational Simulation Series (which began with Wacht am Rhein) presents further refinements to the combat, artillery and supply subsystems in order to better depict tactical and operational warfare at this scale. For example, rules for &ldquo;Lull&rdquo; periods have been added in order to allow players to speed up game play during periods of relative inactivity. These Lulls compress game play from three turns per day to one, allowing players to cover longer intervals of historic time.

The owner of that piece loses the round, and forfeits the offending piece. A new round begins, with the winner of the previous round playing first. Play continues until one player has no pieces when it is their turn to move; they lose the game.<br/><br/>Batik Kid is essentially the same game, but instead of geometric shapes, the playing pieces are irregularly-shaped and represent sea creatures.<br/><br/>",

Use the terrain to your advantage if you can, and a set of helpful Caddie Cards, to be the first to complete each hole.<br/><br/>Roll In One is a quick and casual dice golfing game for 1-5 players! Design simple yet challenging holes, filling your course with fairways, sand traps, and water hazards, seeing who can reach the green first.<br/><br/>Take turns choosing a die and rolling to see how far your ball flies. Each die is like a different club; the D4 like a putter, and the D20 a driver. Move forward as your rolls keep succeeding. The kicker: you MUST keep rolling until you fail. Don't choose the D20 unless you want to go far. Dice have various other sides, some which turn the ball, get stuck in trees, or won&rsquo;t roll on fairways.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ve practiced your swing and are eager to hit the fairway, but do you have what it takes to get a Roll in One?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Early on, players have very limited means. However, by mining resources, acquiring assets, securing contracts, and expanding their operations through new initiatives, players become more readily able to generate more and more amounts of income.<br/><br/>Mines become exhausted after they have been mined for a certain number of turns, and, once exhausted, they are replaced by subsequent mine cards. Similarly, a limited number of assets, initiatives, and contract cards are available for players to take, and, after being acquired, they are replaced until their respective decks run out.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of Turn 7.<br/><br/>At that point in time, the player with the greatest amount of victory points from buildings, Money, and completed contracts is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

One card of each background color is laid out below the appropriate topic card, which depicts the seven images in that color. Each player tries to memorize the cards, which are then turned face down.<br/><br/>On a turn, one player reveals a yard card and the first player to name the yard card of the same color currently face-down in the display claims that card, with the newly revealed card put in its place. If two players name the card at the same time, each player claims a card with extra drawn off the deck as needed; if no one names the card, the face-down card is placed back in the deck while the new card is put in its place.

The Presenter has 90 seconds to act out 6 words, trying to get the other players to correctly guess what word they are presenting. While the presenter is acting out the words, the other players are watching and trying to guess what word is being acted out. If they think they know the word, they write it down on their marker board with their dry erase marker.<br/><br/>Both presenter and the other players are not allowed to talk during the acting!<br/><br/>After the presenter&rsquo;s time is up, he or she will reveal the words to the players, one at a time, asking the players what their guesses were for each word. The other players, one at a time going clockwise around the table, reveal their guesses. After all guesses have been revealed for that word, the presenter then reveals the actual word.<br/><br/>Players score 2 points for guessing the correct word.

        "description": "Blitzkrieg is one of Avalon Hill's earlier releases. The game is a fictional representation of the breakout of World War II. Five minor countries become engulfed in a tremendous conflict for territory waged by Great Blue and Big Red, the major countries.<br/><br/><br/>Blitzkrieg is one of the classic Avalon Hill war games that set up the military simulation board game hobby.<br/><br/>Blitzkrieg is a board game with printed cardboard square pieces played on a hard mapboard. The mapboard is hard paper stock that is the same as what one would find with a Monopoly playboard. Printed on the mapboard is a map on a hexagonal grid (hex spaces, or simply &quot;hexes&quot;), and terrain for land, beach, cities, rivers, roads, mountain, desert, and borders. There are a few charts, such as the one for the combat results table, and a die for random outcomes.<br/><br/>The cardboard pieces represent large military units. There are brigades, divisions, squadrons and air wings. The different types of military units represented are infantry, airborne, rangers, armor, shock artillery, fighters and bombers. Naval action is allowed but abstracted.<br/><br/>There are three levels of the game, the basic game (simplest), advanced (all the complicated rules), and tournament (fast play with advance rules). There are optional rules for the advanced game. The basic game only includes the land game, no naval invasions, and is the best starter tool for new gamers. The basic game has a more simplified combat results table. The advanced game adds special unit abilities, supply restrictions, air war and strategic bombing, naval invasions, commando raids, special desert supply restrictions, etc. Tournament play was intended for play at game conventions such as the annual world board-gaming convention in Harrisburg, Pa.<br/><br/>The nice thing about Blitzkrieg is that it uses a system that is similar to most other hexgames. So once one learns one game, the learning curve of a similar game is not as steep. Such is the case with many of the old Avalon Hill Classics, once you learned one game all of the other played the same way with some minor variation, only the campaign is different.<br/><br/>The basic play used unit types and combat ratings. As expected, infantry would have different abilities from armor or artillery. Each unit had ratings printed in large print on the piece, (or &quot;chits,&quot; as they are called). For example, take a 1-4 infantry brigade. The &quot;4&quot; is the movement factor per turn, so the unit can move four hexes in clear terrain per turn. Movement along a road is 1/3, so a 1-4 infantry can move 12 hexes if moved solely along a road. Each side is permitted to move all of their units up to their full movement allowance. The first rating, the &quot;1&quot; in this case, is the combat factor. Combat is worked out in odds, so that if one moves his 1-4 infantry next to the enemies&rsquo; 1-4 infantry, the combat odds are 1-1 (not very good in combat). There is nothing preventing one from ganging up on an enemy unit, and in fact this is the general tactic even in real life. So if one brought up another brigade into the attack there would be two 1-4 infantry brigades against the enemy's single brigade for 2-1 odds. For example, if the enemy had a 4-4 infantry division sitting on a clear hex and on their turn a player brings up three 4-4 infantry divisions adjacent to have combat, this would be at 12-4 odds, which reduce to 3-1. Then one would consult the combat results table under the 3-1 column and roll the die. The results would resolve the combat and tell what losses there were, and who had to retreat. Obviously, higher odds will favor that side.<br/><br/>Also in combat, terrain would impact combat. A defender in a city or mountain would have their defense rating doubled. For example, a 1-4 infantry in the mountains would defend as a combat rating of 2. Odds are rounded in favor of the defender. From the example above if that 4-4 infantry was defending in a city against those three 4-4 infantry, the odds would now be 12-8, only 1-1 odds (better bring up more attacking troops).<br/><br/>When Blitzkrieg came out this type of map wargame was relatively new, so this game was very novel in its time. It is still a good two player game and there is enough variation so it won't get stale. It has a WWII or early cold war feel to it. The two antagonists are abstract, Big Red and Great Blue, which had more to do with the simple printing colors Avalon Hill used back in the early 1960's than any national commentary.<br/><br/>In the late seventies and eighties many panned Blitzkrieg since many games seem to grind to a stalemate in the middle of the map. But as a training game this isn't such a bad thing, since that can give a new gamer some confidence to play to a draw.<br/><br/>",

Each biome has a different ecology, and gives unique rewards when it is healthy and balanced. But watch out, your opponents may decide it's easier to disturb and degrade your ecosystems than nurture their own. In this hectic environment, you must choose how best to protect and care for your ecologies.<br/><br/>Designed by a biology instructor, the game includes 77 unique organisms, 7 biomes, and beautiful vintage Victorian art. (108 cards total)<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s all about building healthy food webs in different biomes. If you create a healthy ecology you get the perks and powers of that biome. Each organism card lists what it eats and what it&rsquo;s eaten by. You arrange them with plants on the bottom, predators on top. There is a trade mechanic similar to catan where you trade with others based on what you need and what they need. It is a race to get 12 victory points and different organisms give different points. There are factor cards that can affect opponents and different strategies such as focusing on one biome, going for perks and bonuses, or attacking other ecologies.<br/><br/>The game takes inspiration from titles like Settlers of Catan, Agricola, and Dominion. Real science is integral to the game as it is used in the classroom to teach real concepts to biology students. While it is scientific enough for the classroom it is also strategic enough for game night.<br/><br/>The points system is based on ecological trophic levels. The producers (plants) are worth less and as you make your way up the pyramid organisms are worth more as it takes a lot of energy to sustain them. In real life only roughly 10% of the energy makes it from one level to the next, meaning you have to have acres of land and hundreds of animals just to sustain one apex predator. There is a full rule book included with the card game that also goes over the science.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Recruit and task an army of agents, racketeers, spymasters and others to build your reputation by selling your goods and causing chaos for your rivals.  Through a light deck building mechanism you attempt to create the strongest network of agents, racketeers and the most desirable black market goods.  Winners and losers are determined by a fun, yet sophisticated, supply &amp; demand mechanic.<br/><br/>Plunderbund combines the innate corruption and profiteering of prohibition Chicago and the lawlessness of the fantasy setting, the Sprawl.<br/><br/>It's an era before cell phones, e-commerce and customer relationship management tools, an honest guild had to get business the hard way: thieving, sorcery, money laundering and bribery. Plunderbund is your chance to lead your guild to fame, fortune or disaster as you navigate the whims of the notoriously picky Sprawl consumer and deal with underhanded tactics from rivals determined to steal your business.<br/><br/>Each player will lead a guild with the power to decide where your finite resources are invested.  A light deck building mechanic enables you to acquire and improve your black market goods, add agents, add racketeers, disrupt your rivals&rsquo; operations or just wreak havoc.  Cards are added to your deck through a simple snake draft from a limited selection of over twenty different recruits.<br/><br/>Your guild gains reputation (VPs) as a sophisticated yet simply implemented supply and demand mechanic helps you sell your black market goods to merchants.  At the end of the game you will be compared to your rivals on the strength of your network of agents, number of racketeers and black market goods qualities.  All this growth comes at a cost, you have to take favors as you try to build your operation without the benefit of any gold in your coffers.  As they say &ldquo;paybacks are hell&rdquo;.  Fail to payback your favors and you pay the price as you see your reputation diminished at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

As each round ends the AI player increases strength and moves in to attack the nearest player. This forces players to end their turn as far away as possible by either expanding the map or moving. Resources in hand and large boards will result in shorter rounds making it harder as the game progresses. Players not eliminated by the AI or other players win.

Tarot cards make up the often-changing board, and players use Looney Pyramids to represent minions that control those territories. Every tarot card has a power, and when a player has one of his pieces on a territory, he or she may use the power of that territory through that piece. Players also have a hand of tarot cards which allow them to use those powers through any of their pieces. Territories are worth points when occupied, and the game ends when one player challenges the other players and has 9 points on his or her following turn.<br/><br/>Gnostica is a redevelopment of Zarcana.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by Zark City, and Dectana.

St. Jean . . . . just south of the village of Waterloo. The road to Brussels then was a straight shot north. Two days of hard marching would see them in the capital, three if they had to fight a battle. . .<br/> As Napoleon, can you mass the French in time to crush each Allied army in succession?

On your turn you may either buy stock and increase its value, sell all of your stock to get quick cash while also lowering the company's value, or lay track. While the shares might come out randomly, it's all about careful timing and the willingness to drop something good for something even better.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when all of the Shares have been bought or sold off, 20 dividends have been paid, or railroad companies cannot lay any additional track. The players add together their cash in hand to the value of each of their shares, and the player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fanorona is a classical two-person strategic abstract game that comes from the island of Madagascar and is still popular there today. It is played on a rectangular board made up of two Alquerque boards with 22 plain black and white pieces. Capturing is compulsory and a series of captures may be made by the same piece on a turn, as in checkers. Unique aspects of the game include its method of capture (either approaching or withdrawing your piece from a line of enemy pieces), and the &quot;vela partie&quot; (debt game) after winning a decisive game (the winner must let the loser &quot;eat&quot; one man each turn for 17 consecutive moves). Because of the density of the board (only one open spot at the games beginning) and the unique method of capture, strategy is complex and enigmatic, with fewer pieces often beating more pieces. (While very different, the game feels somewhat like Zertz due to the above.)<br/><br/>Historical note from one game box: Some Fanorona matches were devoted to the Gods and last but not least the fate and colonialization of Madagascar (1895) supposed to be solved unbloody with Fanorona on the game table.<br/><br/>",

They are cute and friendly, very different and they don&rsquo;t have a name! What name shall we call them? That&rsquo;s how the game begins.<br/><br/>What is the game about?<br/><br/>The players take turns to draw a card from the pack and open then. There is a picture of a Toddle-Bobble on the card. If this Toddle-Bobble appears for the first time, the player who opened the card gives him a name. Everyone needs to remember this name. The player who remembers the name correctly and is the first to shout it out next time when the Toddle-Bobble comes up in the game, will claim all the open cards to his winning pile.<br/><br/>Let&rsquo;s see who is going to have the best collection of Toddle-Bobbles portraits!

On your turn, you combine the results of your rolled dice to perform up to two actions. The two aspects on each side of a die offer a large choice of number and color combinations.<br/><br/>While all four games follow the same general rules and last 30-60 minutes, each one is set in a specific universe and offers a distinct playstyle:<br/><br/>1. CRAZY CUP is a competitive racing game for 1 to 4 players, ages 8 and up.<br/>Participate in a frantic race through the Grand Canyon. What devious tricks will you employ to hinder your opponents, and be the first to cross the finish line?<br/><br/>2.

Just like in a fighting game, you have to know your character, know the matchup, and know your opponent. Each character has a deck that follows the same conventions as a deck of playing cards. This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.<br/><br/>Yomi: Round 2 is a standalone item that contains four characters (out of twenty) for the second edition of Yomi. With these characters, you can compete in 1v1, 2v2, 2v1, and solo modes, with each player in the game needing one character deck. The character decks in Yomi: Round 2 can also be played against those in Yomi: Round 1 or any of the individual character decks that comprise the second edition of Yomi. As for the characters, they are:<br/><br/>&bull; Quince (challenging to play well)<br/><br/><br/>    Quince can play TWO cards in combat sometimes!<br/>    Quince can spin his combat card around after seeing what the opponent played! <br/>    Politicians are straightforward and truthful, but this deck is very tricky to play<br/><br/><br/>&bull; Onimaru (easy to understand)<br/><br/><br/>    Onimaru has attacks that can beat any other attacks in the game.<br/>    Onimaru relies on single hits for high damage, rather than big combos.<br/>    He can guard crush through an opponent's block. <br/><br/><br/>&bull; Bal-Bas-Beta (very difficult to understand)<br/><br/><br/>    Put your opponent at long range and they can't even damage BBB, but BBB can damage them.<br/>    BBB can play relatively safely while dealing low damage, then shift to high damage plays to end the game. <br/>    Robots have a lot of moving parts, so it takes some thinking to understand BBB, but once you do he isn't as hard to play as it seems.<br/><br/><br/>&bull; Troq (easy to understand)<br/><br/><br/>    Troq is simple and powerful.<br/>    Troq smash. <br/>    Troq throw 'u'.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "A.D. 30: Jesus&rsquo; Journey to Jerusalem is a very reverent solitaire game that takes you, as the player, along the travels of Jesus, from His baptism in the River Jordan to His triumphant entry into Jerusalem. Along the way, you will make decisions which will affect the outcome of His journeys and teachings. Thirteen possible alternate outcomes are included not to imply that other outcomes were in fact possible, but to build a strategy game that includes challenges with possibility of success and failure as the player of the game. Achieving the Major Victory (the historical outcomes) will demonstrate the extraordinary set of circumstances that took place and were necessary to achieve the birth of Christianity.<br/><br/>The events that take place often cause the political and religious leaders of the area (represented by Caiaphas, Herod Antipas, and Pontius Pilate in the game) to take notice and become increasingly concerned. In game terms, this is shown by moving those Leader markers along a track on the game board, advancing them from their start spaces one step at a time until they reach the final space on that track (&ldquo;Arrest in Jerusalem&rdquo;), at which point they attempt to arrest Jesus.<br/><br/>You get the chance to react to these movements with several choices each game turn. The goal is to assemble all twelve apostles, maintain a high level of piety, and enter into Jerusalem. Additionally, when trying to reconstruct the beginnings of Christianity historically, it is imperative that Judas betrays Jesus in Jerusalem. Events tend to push Jesus towards Jerusalem, but try to avoid entering too early before all the important pieces are in place!<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/><br/>Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A few months after Finland made its Declaration of Independence from Russian rule at December of 1917 a civil war broke out between Finnish Reds and Whites. The paramilitary Red Guards formed by the worker class took control of Helsinki on the 27th of January 1918. The Senate fled from Helsinki and declared the White guards as their official troops.<br/><br/>On the 3rd of April 1918 the German Baltic Sea Division landed in southern Finland. By the 11th of April they had reached the outskirts of Helsinki and their commander R&uuml;diger von der Goltz launched an attack to conquer Helsinki. The Russian Navy had a significant naval base and fortifications in Helsinki, but respecting the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk they left Helsinki and did not take part in the battle. The Red Guards made a hasty decision not to surrender but to defend Helsinki. The White Guards had built their own underground paramilitary organization and were waiting for the right moment to take control of the centre.<br/><br/>Helsinki 1918 is a hex wargame for three players. The game offers a historical representation of the Battle of Helsinki between 11th and 13th of April and covers the whole battle from the outskirts to the centre of the city. Each hex represents an approximately 300 meters wide area and each unit represents a company sized force.<br/><br/>The German player must execute a well-planned advance to defeat the Reds and avoid high casualties especially in skirmishes on the streets of the centre. The Red player&rsquo;s focus is to maintain a high fighting spirit and recruit new groups to reinforce the defence. Meanwhile the White player must wait for the right opportunity to deploy their hidden troops onto the streets of Helsinki.<br/><br/>Helsinki 1918 game contains:<br/><br/>1 map (1050 mm x 850 mm)<br/>1 rulebook<br/>41 cards<br/>76 unit and HQ markers<br/>6 dice<br/>Scenarios for 2 and 3 players<br/><br/>",

As a city architect your role is to plan the layout of your city, build landmarks, provide services, manage residents and deal with random events that affect your city.<br/><br/>The game is played over 3 rounds with players scoring after each round. On your turn pick a building from the ones set up at the beginning of a round and place it on your city board and try to create patterns based on goal cards. When picking a landmark, take a landmark tile to go with it and try to fulfill its requirements. After filling up a whole district with buildings, gain a boat. 2 boats let you acquire a service for your city which makes it more attractive to the residents. After a round is completed score points in 3 ways:<br/><br/>GOALS - each pattern is worth a number of points<br/>LANDMARKS - each landmark has a unique requirement for where it needs to be placed and what other buildings should it be surrounded by<br/>SERVICES - each service provides points for a specific set of buildings in your city<br/><br/>At any point of your turn you are able to use construction tokens to demolish buildings and build them again in a different spot, use buildings from an additional building pool or have more choice when choosing the right service for your city.<br/><br/>RESIDENTS module<br/><br/>More advanced players will definitely want to play with an extra module that comes in the box - RESIDENTS.<br/>This module adds an additional board to each player's city board where you place residents that come to your city. Residents allow you to score additional points, reuse your construction tokens and gain extra boats which in turn let you acquire more services for your city.<br/><br/>EVENT module<br/><br/>Spice things up with the event deck! Pick a card and see whether you&rsquo;ll have to deal with an impending disaster or strike of good fortune. Disasters can ruin your plans if you don&rsquo;t prepare for them in time and positive events might give you that extra boost on your path to victory.<br/><br/>The game ends after the scoring phase for round 3.

It is felt that with their combined skills and variety of individual experience, they will be able to solve the problems presented. The players try to reconstruct the crime by asking, guessing and fiddling about.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t=======How would it be if we formed a Club? What is today ? Tuesday? We will call it The Tuesday Night Club. It is to meet every week, and each member in turn has to propound a problem. Some mystery of which they have personal knowledge, and to which, of course, they know the answer. Let me see, how many are we? One, two, three, four, five. We ought really to be six... (Joyce Lempri&eacute;re)<br/><br/>From this conversation in Agatha Christie&rsquo;s book &lsquo;The Tuesday Club Murders&rsquo;, a series of great detective stories come up, where perceptive characters rival Miss Marple, who teachs them a real lesson of shrewdness, explaining with talent and with all kind of misteries, no matter how strange or complicated they may be.<br/><br/>This game is exactly that: a narrative game based on the classic detective stories. A group of five players cooperate and compete to solve a mistery proposed by a sixth player, known as the host, trying to emulate Sherlock Holmes himself, from Arthur Conan Doyle&rsquo;s books. Host and players find themselves entwined in a complicated game of cat and mouse, where the first one propose a mysterious enigma and the others must solve it by racking their brains. For a length of an hour, as that is the time limit to solve the mistery, an intense (intellectual) battle is fought, where the host challenges the rest of the members of the Tuesday Club to find a solution that almost never is near or within reach. The armchair detectives will have to use in a creative way the clich&eacute;s with which their dramatic characters have been defined, and they will have to make the appropriate questions in order to find the solution.<br/><br/>Therefore, this is a game that puts the perceptiveness, intuition, and above all the logical and deductive intelligence of the participants to test. The constant interactivity among the players, the creation of intelligent questions with shrewdness, wit and creativity, and the dynamism of the intrigue make &lsquo;El Club de los Martes&rsquo; a perfect game to spend an hour of fun with family or friends.<br/><br/>El Club de los Martes is many games in one.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t=======A narrative game of deduction and logic. All players are armchair detectives meeting every Tuesday to engage on some crime solving. A host presents the case and in turns each player can ask questions and use his or her special abilities to gather more information. Asking questions and gathering information cost money -every player starts the game with 15 pounds - paid to a common pool. Proposing a solution is very expensive and other players may benefit economically from you failures. Only one player may win, but the solution relies on the information gathered by the whole group with certain cooperatives aspects. If no detective solves the crime after one hour, nobody wins. The player with the &ldquo;first player&rdquo; token has the advantage because she starts every round; but if that player passes, she loses the token that goes to the next player.<br/><br/>Based in novel &quot;The Tuesday Club Murders&quot; by Agatha Christie.<br/><br/>Rules one are available in Spanish language.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is all about thinking up clever words that will be hard to decipher and cleverly combining letter pieces to guess secret words.<br/><br/>Decipher is a different kind of word game for 2&ndash;4 players. Players use four differently-shaped letter pieces to create and solve word puzzles. In each round, a different player builds a secret word puzzle. The others know only which letter pieces are in the secret word and gather clues and points by asking about where letter pieces go. Can you decipher the the secret word?<br/><br/>The Letter Piece Game system is a special way to build letters from four different basic shapes. The idea for the Letter Piece Game&trade; system comes from the game designers of Wordsmith &mdash; Bill Eberle, Greg Olotka, Peter Olotka, and Jack Kittredge &mdash; whose credits include Cosmic Encounter, Dune, Hoax, and more.<br/><br/>Decipher includes the same playful semi-transparent colored plastic letter pieces found in Wordsmith. A special plastic insert turns the game box into a game component.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After a century of slumber, you awaken to discover your castle in a disgraceful state. This will not do! Vampires are, after all, connoisseurs of the very best that (un)life has to offer... Renovate the most imposing rooms of your lair! Fill the halls with ghoulish servants! Drink a fine wine, pose dramatically on the highest tower, and write dreadful poetry! But beware the curious and bold locals that might wander by - perhaps you can invite them in...for a drink?<br/><br/>Deckula is a darkly-comic card game of high stakes (sorry) where you try to balance a decadent lifestyle with fending off aspiring vampire hunters and looters. It's quick and easy-to-play, with scalable difficulty and a small footprint.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to make it to the end of the deck without getting killed by any visitors to the castle. Each turn, you have a simple decision to make - draw a card and decide whether to buy it (adding it to your tableau) or discard it (gaining energy points to purchase future cards). Many cards are worth victory points and most of them feature a variety of tricky effects you can use to defend yourself and manipulate the flow of play. The visitor cards are the exception - they'll instantly enter a 'threat area' and have a couple of nasty effects that can affect your score or even destroy you, if you're not careful. The challenge is playing as many high-scoring cards as possible while still keeping the negative effects of the visitors under control.<br/><br/>The game ends when you make it to the end of the deck - winning the game and scoring your cards - or when a visitor or other card effect causes you to lose.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>In the 2021 Solitaire Print &amp; Play Contest, Deckula won:<br/><br/>     1st place in Best Use of Theme<br/>     2nd place in Best Graphic Design<br/>     2nd place in Best New Solo Designer<br/><br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Kirche &amp; Staat&quot; contains historical events related to church &amp; state, can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Early in the morning of May 10, 1940, under the Codeword Danzig, Fallschirmj&auml;ger from the 7th Flieger Division and 22nd Luftlande executed surprise landings at Den Haag, on the road to Rotterdam and against the Fortress of Eben Emael in order to facilitate German Army Group B's feint advance in Belgium, while the main attack was conducted by stronger Army Group A led by seven panzer divisions from the Ardennes, through a terrain believed uncrossable to armor units. France and the UK reacted immediately, activating the Dyle-Breda Plan, and thus committing their best forces directly into the trap. Then in June the evacuation of Dunkirk was a partial success, but the battle for France was over with an astonishing German victory. Four years elapsed before the Western Allies would come back to the continent and thus finally defeat Germany.<br/><br/>Blocks in the West (BITW) recalls, in game form, the most decisive battles fought in the European Theater Front from the invasion of France until the collapse of the Nazi regimen in May 1945. BITW is a game of World War II conflict simulation at the operational level. Although based on historical events and battles, the players in command of the two factions can modify the evolution of World War II on the Western Front. The game is recommended for two, three or four players: one/two control the Western Allies and the other one/two control Germany and Italy. The game is imminently suitable for solitary play: the single player just controls both sides. In this case, playing with Fog of War is mandatory.<br/><br/>Developed on a wooden blocks and cubes system over an astonishing 124x87cm full-laminated multicolor map board, Blocks in the West includes no paper components other than the manual. All of the over 900 wooden/plastic components/stickers have been created by the best Italian artisinal industry and painted A buratto, a technique usually adopted for painting car parts and accessories. In terms of scale, a hexagon is approximately 44 miles (70 km) across, a game turn is one month long, and a full-strength counter represents a major military formation (normally a corps) of ca. 30,000 men, 300 Tanks or 300 planes depending on the unit type, equipment, nationality, etc<br/><br/>The rules are divided into three major sections which can be learned one at a time. The basic game rules introduce the basic concepts and enables players to start playing the game without too many rules to remember. Then the advanced game rules provide more specific and detailed rules for an enhanced realism, such as the use of fuel and the advanced production system. Finally, for those players who want to get the best out of the game, optional rules can be added as desired; these include Technology Research, Strategic warfare over German factories and U-Boot Campaign in the Atlantic Ocean, Amphibious Invasions, and Parachute Assaults.<br/><br/>Blocks in the West can be played standalone or combined with Blocks in the East and Blocks in Afrika.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1756, Frederick the Great launched a preemptive strike on Saxony and his archenemy Austria, sparking the Seven Years War and pitting the most powerful countries of Europe against the fledgling state of Prussia. Frederick's gamble nearly destroyed Prussia, but a few stunning victories over numerically superior forces, many delaying actions, British gold, and the timely death of Tsarina Elizabeth of Russia saved Prussia and ensured Frederick's place in history as a great general.<br/><br/>Prussia's Defiant Stand recreates the fierce struggle for mastery of Central Europe. Using the well-proven, card-driven action system the game showcases the importance of maneuver, fortresses, sieges, supply, and the potentially costly option of winter campaigning. The countries of Prussia, Austria, France, Russia, and Sweden are represented with units for leaders and artillery, heavy and light infantry, cavalry, Cossacks, and fortresses.<br/><br/>Players will have difficult choices in managing their cards as some can be used for &quot;commands&quot; to move units, or used to modify combat odds.  The game mechanics reflect the period's focus on maneuver for position and a &quot;Frictions of War&quot; table beautifully models the indecisiveness of many allied leaders.  This explains more than anything how the small nation of Prussia was able to withstand the combined weight of the most powerful states of the day.  Frederick himself attributed Prussia's survival more to the timidity of allied commanders than to his own actions.<br/><br/>This game is available now at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.worthingtongames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.worthingtongames.com</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the card game version of Aladdin's Dragons, but carries the same title as that game.<br/><br/>In ancient and long forgotten times heroes were lured to Eastern lands by tales of bountiful treasure and powerful magic.  The treasure was found, not lying about, but in dangerous caves guarded by fierce dragons.  Those strong enough to gather the dragon&rsquo;s treasures had to compete among themselves for privileges that would smooth the way to the Caliph&rsquo;s palace.  On reaching the palace, the heroes found their way blocked by powerful guards.  Here they could pass the guards only with the right influence or, failing that, generous bribes.  Within the palace walls, the heroes bartered their hard won treasures for magical artifacts in a contest to see who could acquire the most artifacts and gain the praise of the Caliph.<br/><br/>The Aladdin&rsquo;s Dragons Card Game (Morgenland Kartenspiel) is based on the award winning board game of the same name published by Rio Grande and Hans im Gl&uuml;ck.  The game consists of a double pack of cards and is played over a number of rounds, usually four or five in total.  Each round has three phases.  In phase one, new artifact and treasure cards are laid out.  In phase two, players play their hero cards into the various locations.  In phase three, the locations are resolved.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Reviving Kathmandu is a bidding and set collection game for 1-6 players. In the game, players are builders who travel to Nepal. They&rsquo;ll compete to earn the title of Most Respected Architect in Kathmandu.<br/><br/>Bid on construction materials (cards). Then collect those cards and use them to build the most prestigious Buddhas, Shrines, Stupas and Pagodas (&ldquo;Monuments&rdquo;). You&rsquo;ll score points for your monuments, for achieving special objectives, and for paying special attention to color. The architect who achieves the most points will win the game.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>The game is played over 8 rounds. Each round has 3 phases: Bid, Collect, and Build. Players work through these 3 phases, in this order. Each phase is explained in greater detail in the rulebook. But, generally, players will:<br/><br/>- BID: Starting with the first player and continuing clockwise, each player must place 1 coin of their choice face-down onto one of the bid spots on the playmat. Each bid spot targets 2 cards within the same row or column.<br/><br/>- COLLECT: Players flip their coins and determine who won each card. Determine the winner for each card using this order:<br/>  1. The only bidder<br/>  2. Highest bidder<br/>  3.If tied, the player whose coin is closest to the card<br/>  4. If still tied, the player whose coin is on the long edge of the card<br/>Then each player collects 2 cards total to their hands &mdash; taking from the Market and/or the red deck.<br/><br/>- BUILD: Players use as many cards as they want from their hands to build Monuments. To add to a Monument, slide an appropriate card under the previous one, revealing the section that continues the Monument. Once a Monument has all its required sections, it is &ldquo;complete.&rdquo; Buddhas are considered complete immediately after they are built. When you complete a Monument, immediately score points for completing it<br/><br/>The game has 8 rounds. After every 4 rounds, each player will only have 1 coin left. When this happens, players either convert their last coin to points or buy 1 discarded card.<br/><br/>MISSIONS: Players may complete various objectives for bonus points. Each Mission contains 4 objectives&mdash;to complete a Buddha, a Shrine, a Stupa, and/or a Pagoda with sections matching the color(s) shown on the Mission.<br/><br/>GAME END:<br/>- Discard all cards left in your hands and discard piles.<br/>- Score points for the topmost card of any incomplete Monuments.<br/>- Score color bonuses (if any) for your completed Monument.<br/><br/>WINNING: The player with the most points becomes the most well-respected architect, and therefore wins the game!<br/><br/>Reviving Kathmandu is the second game in the Lemery Games Globetrotter Game Series, after Chili Mafia.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The despicable evil marauders attack everywhere in search of conquest. The citizens are helpless and will soon be overwhelmed. Death and destruction awaits all those in the path of the evil ones.<br/><br/>In Dark Minions players represent those forces of evil as they try to pillage and destroy towns. Each turn, the players typically roll three dice and may use the resulting numbers to attack Towns to win Vanquish Points (VPs) &ndash; the further along into the game, the more VPs the Towns are worth. Players also attempt to capture Towers in order to level up experience (which enables the player to roll better dice), to re-spawn dead minions from the graveyard, and to &quot;purchase&quot; the services of the various Overlords. In the end, it's all about VPs and the first player to 40 VPs in a four-player game wins.<br/><br/>The advanced game adds 15 Minion Overlords, each with a unique special power that may affect the play or the outcome of the game. They patiently wait to enter play and wreak their terrible havoc. Using their abilities wisely is one of the many keys to victory.<br/><br/>Dark Minions includes a small expansion called Demon Lords that adds more Overlords, a special town tile, and a special die &ndash; making for many ways to mix up the game play!<br/><br/>",

Many Jedi have arrived to rescue them, including Mace Windu and Kit Fisto. But suddenly the Jedi are surrounded by an army of battle droids and super battle droids led by Count Dooku.<br/><br/>In Star Wars: Angriff der Klonkrieger , you'll try to use your Jedi dice to hold your position and fend off the onslaught of droids. Will you be able to hold out until Yoda arrives with the clone army?<br/><br/> Game Mechanics<br/><br/>Each player has a set of dice, and together the players must fend off special threats and new droids that are arriving every round. Every player throws a die each round and then they are allocated.<br/><br/>The special threats need particular dice values (for example, four threes) which can be collected over multiple rounds. Failing to counter a special threat may lead to additional droids being put on the board, or immediate defeat.<br/><br/>For attacking droids just the sum of the dice values is used. This is the only part of the game where the player figurines must move on the board to get into attack range.<br/><br/>The game ends after a fixed number of rounds, or if the players fail to counter a special threat.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Campaign Commander Volume II: Coral Sea<br/><br/>Coral Sea is a new volume in the Campaign Commander series and simulates the campaign in the South Seas of the Pacific between the spring of 1942 and the spring of 1943. The Japanese expansion reaches its limit in the archipelago of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. The Japanese initial force, the Army of the South Seas, began to expand reducing the boundaries of the Australian defenses from its base in Rabaul, the logistic center of Japanese control in the zone.<br/>The naval-air battle of the Coral Sea was a hard blow for the Japanese force since the Soho, their light aircraft carrier, was sunk, and the amphibious invasion force destined to take Port Moresby had to return to Rabaul without fulfilling their mission. Afterwards the imperial forces tried to take Port Moresby by a ground assault, extending their way along the Solomon Islands creating air bases and observation stations throughout the archipelago.<br/>The Japanese forces were thus threatening naval communications between the United States and Australia.  In response, the Allies reinforced Australia and the New Caledonia zone looking for an opportunity to counterattack and to stop the imperial tide extending through the region. The return to Australia of veteran units from the Middle East allowed the Allies to initiate an offensive in Papua/New Guinea that would last six bloody months and result in the Allied recovery of the enclaves of Buna and Gona on the North coast of New Guinea.<br/><br/>In the Solomon Islands the North American counterattack began August 8th, 1942 and led to a lasting and bloody campaign through February 1943, with successive attacks and counterattacks of both sides resulting in Guadalcanal Island back in American hands. In addition to the ground forces, the region saw much use of air and naval operations.  Both navies accomplished herculean tasks to support their respective ground forces and supply them.  Their importance was noticeable, so air attacks on navies were numerous, and expensive in lives, planes and ships.  The last of them in this period was the battle of the Sea of Bismarck, which resulted in Allied air supremacy in the region.<br/>The Japanese Imperial navy based on the island of Truk made several raids in the region to support the small naval forces in the South Seas. But eventually the Japanese had to yield the initiative to the allies in the region as they exhausted their resources, fighting on two fronts.  The Allies exhausted the Japanese offensive, and they prepare to take their own offensive.<br/><br/>The game is developed in an operational scale &ndash; area-based map with a scale 1:300,000.  It is designed for two players with one running the JAPANESE forces and the other the ALLIED forces. The game lasts approximately 3-4 hours and uses a two sided system to handle the mechanics of play: cards and counters.  The players will have to use their troops and their resources to obtain victory points while eliminating enemy forces and occupying cities in the map. It is not a card driven game as the cards are used to bring about events that influence battles, secure reinforcements, and provide resources with which to carry on the fight.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the game the JAPANESE player will take the Initiative and will have to expand throughout the map to secure Victory Points. The ALLIED player is on the defensive, and will have to strength his forces as the game progresses. He will have to take advantage of every opportunity to inflict damage on the advancing Japanese forces.  The island of Guadalcanal will be crucial as the game develops, as are the results of actions in Papua/New Guinea.   <br/>The JAPANESE player must face the historical dilemma of concentrating on taking the Solomon Islands, Papua or both simultaneously.  The ALLIED player will have to be patient and force his opponent to extend himself, by accumulating forces and to committing lethal offensives that put the forces of the Empire of the Rising Sun in check. <br/>Like all the games of this Series, the rules are simple and straight forward.  Our objective was to create games that are very interactive, and offer players a pleasant creative experience.  We aim for solid games for players who do not have the time or the space to leave a game setup and in place over a long period of play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;...and all were certain the day was ours.&rdquo; Irvin McDowell<br/><br/>On August 4, 1861, Brigadier General Irvin McDowell submitted his report on the campaign and resulting battle of Bull Run on July 21,1861, the first significant campaign of the American Civil War in Virginia. His report captures his wonder at how the Union army's unexpected turning movement and resulting victorious moment turned into a mass of disorder streaming towards Washington by nightfall. The Confederates had been outmaneuvered and outfought in the morning engagement and seemed simply unaware of the fact that they had been beaten as McDowell and staff clearly saw. That unwillingness to accept defeat brought the Confederates a victory.<br/><br/>Inexperience and exuberance were present in equal measure in both armies and combined to provide for a uniquely chaotic battlefield. As you review your armies the names of brigade and division commanders will be instantly familiar; Sherman, Jackson, Burnside, Johnston, et al are all present where they began to learn their trade.<br/><br/>The Blind Swords system provides a custom fit for this early war battle where troops may or may not respond to orders, may hold their fire thinking that the enemy is their friend and where chaos was certainly the order of the day. The Day Was Ours is the sixth game in Revolution Games' Blind Swords series of regimental-level games on American Civil War Battles.<br/><br/>",

Over three epochs, you will discover new planets, populate them, use their mineral wealth to build spaceships, and try to gain superiority over your opponent.<br/><br/>During the game, you obtain cards that represent planets, shuttles, mining stations, and colonized parts of planets. Planet building is one of the game's key mechanisms, and using it correctly can be a crucial winning strategy. By building a fleet of merchant, diplomatic, and battle ships, you gain influence in the explored universe &mdash; and in the laboratories, your scientists might discover new technologies that can turn the duel in your favor at the right moment.<br/><br/>At the same time, however, you can &mdash; and must! &mdash; use cards as raw materials to build your empire, so during the game you are always considering how to use them most effectively. Is it better to play out the card &mdash; or pay with it? Laying out the right combinations of cards will allow you to have better and more varied options in subsequent turns. Whoever builds the best functioning new civilization after three epochs wins.<br/><br/>Aldebaran Duel includes a variant for solo play.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, the player first declares which city they want to attack, then rolls all ten dice. Any dice showing the &quot;nuke&quot; symbol are locked and cannot be rerolled. Laser guns are similarly locked, allowing the player to reroll only the alien heads. If the player rerolls and ever has as many nuke symbols showing as the number on the face-up cards and the supplementary token, their turn ends; otherwise they can stop at any time, and if they don't have enough guns or alien heads to claim their target, they mark their total with one of their tokens, allowing them to add on to this number on a future turn &mdash; assuming that someone else doesn't claim the card first.<br/><br/>Some city cards have special powers, such as Seattle's, which allows you to place one die on the symbol of your choice prior to rolling. Las Vegas, true to its nature, wants you to go bust multiple times in order to claim the card. Whoever ends up decimating the largest portion of the earth wins. Ak ak ak ak ak!<br/><br/>",

Place one card from the deck letter side up and another color side up. When the timer starts, everybody plays at the same time. You can play a letter on the letter pile as long as you can name something that starts with that letter and that &quot;matches&quot; the current color showing; similarly, you can play a color on the color pile as long as you can name something of that color that starts with the letter atop the letter pile. For example, when playing a &quot;B&quot; card next to a yellow card, you could say &quot;Banana!&quot;, and when playing an orange card next to an &quot;L&quot;, you could say &quot;Lion!&quot; You can't repeat a word previously given, and you can't name the color of the color card.<br/><br/>Whenever you want, you can say &quot;Roger!&quot;, and all players must flip the cards in their hand, so letters become colors and vice versa. Alternatively, you can say &quot;Over!&quot;, and players pass their cards to the left.<br/><br/>When time runs out, you gain points equal to the number of stars on played letter cards, then subtract 1 point for each unplayed card.

Four powerful Soviet Fronts must be used in close cooperation to overcome the Axis forces, which include two Panzer Armies. The game contains 85% of the total Wehrmacht&rsquo;s mechanized strength at this stage of the war and 75% of the Red Army&rsquo;s.   The Germans must hold the Dnepr barrier as long as possible, followed by a fighting retreat to the Carpathian Mountains to the west.  The Soviets can crush the Axis invader with the advantage of their most reliable ally:  General Winter.  It is the Third Winter on the Russian Front.<br/><br/>The Soviets have the initiative and a formidable force, but an equally challenging task.  The Dnepr is a huge obstacle and the German panzer formations are wounded but dangerous.  The German player has the challenge of active defense in the style of Army Group South Commander Erich von Manstein.  Both sides are in for a challenging fight.<br/><br/>The Third Winter is a big game, with 5-mile hexes, 3.5-day turns, and counters for units from battalions up to divisions. The battles from this campaign &ndash; the Race to the Dnepr, the Battle of Kiev, Korsun Pocket, the Kamenets-Podolsky pocket (&ldquo;Hube&rsquo;s Pocket&rdquo;) and the splitting of Army Group South in two&mdash;merge into the dynamic of whole campaign.  <br/>Special rules in this 19th game of the Operational Combat Series have been carefully designed to recreate this intense campaign. They include:<br/><br/>&bull; Soviet Front command structure is modeled by the four Fronts being either on Offensive or Paused posture.  The Soviet player can switch one front &ldquo;off&rdquo; and another &ldquo;on&rdquo; to shift focus and force the Axis to deal with sudden threats in a different part of the map.  When Soviet formations are burned out, they withdraw into the &ldquo;RVGK&rdquo; for rebuilding, and can reappear suddenly in a new area, enabling Maskirovka surprises.  Each Front has a dedicated Air Army and Frontal Barrages to initiate offensives. The game shows the increasing strength and competency of the Red Army in both units and Action ratings.<br/>&bull; German units in play include Kampfgruppe Divisions, German Remnants, German Army and Army Group HQs,Tiger Companies, Hartman and JG52 aces, Hans-Ulrich Rudel and his tank-busting aircraft, and the Romanian Home army<br/>&bull; Random events similar to what are found in the award-winning Beyond the Rhine. These cover things like Soviet Patrol Boat Raids, Lend-Lease, Fuel Shortages, Heroes who affect combat, Arty Ammo Stockpiles, and Partisan Offensives.  The 44 possible events add a lot of historical flavor but require very little rules overhead.<br/>&bull; The importance and difficulty of the Dnepr crossings are distilled into rules allowing the bridges to be blown and repaired, and ferries to be emplaced, all leading to Soviet Bridgehead battles <br/>&bull; Both sides were deploying more and more anti-aircraft assets, modeled with units that make air barrages more difficult.<br/>&bull; Axis Fortress HQ units that enable cut-off units to continue to function and shows the decline of the Wehrmacht, from a mobile warfare army to a defensive army, with limited counterattack capability. KG HQs allow ad hoc mechanized formations to combine to simulate the desperate nature of the struggle.<br/><br/>The Third Winter features two monster-sized campaigns that use a 44x66-inch map layout and over 1,500 combat units. Also included are several smaller scenarios, including four 1-map games.<br/><br/>Scenario 1 The Dnepr Battles (Grand Campaign Game, 4 maps, 63 turns, 26 Sept 1943 to 26 April 1944)<br/>Scenario 2 Die G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung (January Campaign Start, 4 maps, 27 turns, 26 Jan 44 to 26 April 44)<br/>Scenario 3 Red Thunder (April Campaign Start, 2 maps, 6 turns, 8 Apr 44 to 26 April 44)<br/>Scenario 4 Manstein&rsquo;s Fire Brigades (Battle for Kiev, 1 map, 9 turns, 26 Dec 43 to 22 Jan 44)<br/>Scenario 5 II SS Pz Corps Strikes Back (Battle for Ternopol, 1 map, 6 turns, 8 Apr 44 to 26 April 44)<br/>Scenario 6 Rumanian Finish (Odessa and breaking into Rumania, 1 map, 6 turns, 8 Apr 44 to 26 April 44)<br/>Scenario 7 Hube&rsquo;s Pocket (The &ldquo;Moving Pocket&rdquo; Battle, 1 map, 8 turns, 22 Mar 44 to 15 Apr 44)<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1/2 Week<br/>Hex: 5 miles / 8 km<br/>Units: Company to Corps<br/> Game Inventory:<br/>Four 22&quot; X 34&quot; mapsheets<br/>Eight countersheets (2,240 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters)<br/>One 48-page OCS rules booklet<br/>One Third Winter game rules booklet<br/>One Third Winter scenario booklet<br/>Two 4 page OCS Charts &amp; Tables folders<br/>Three Player Aid Cards (1 sided)<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It sets out from the arrival of Carthage in the fourth century BC, follows the footsteps of Roman, Germanic, Byzantine and Muslim conquerors, and finally takes part in the early reconquista of the Christian kingdoms of Castile, Leon, Aragon and Portugal.<br/><br/>Hispania adapts the basic system of Britannia and re-locates it to Ancient / early Medieval Spain and Portugal, adding and changing some rules along the way. The actual time period covered is 320 BC to 1220 AD.<br/><br/>In Hispania advanced rules, the players try to outbid each other in an auction for up to 30 different tribes and peoples. The auction system guarantees that each game is quite unlike the previous one. Each time the players lead different peoples and adjust to their respective victory conditions, all of which have been modeled on historical requirements.<br/><br/>Special unit types include Knights, Castles and Elites.

Whenever a player goes over the limit, the right-hand player gets an island card. When a player announces a number that another player has in hand as an island card, then he&rsquo;s put his foot in it and receives a Fettnapf card. The game ends when a player has collected 4 Fettnapf cards. The winner is the player with the fewest Fettnapf cards.<br/><br/>",

Feelinks contains 50 cards offering 150 situations from everyday life. For example: &quot;You wake up in the body of a person of a different ethnicity&quot; or &quot;The Minister of Justice is caught smoking cannabis&quot;. The players are obligated to express their feelings in a given situation and to guess the feeling of another player in the same situation.

Gameplay takes place on two copies of the same game board that are separated by the game box so that they are not visible to one another. The Poseidon player throws powerful storms against the Navigators, driving them off-course and confounding them so that they cannot reach the Sacred Island in time. Only Poseidon knows the real position of the ships as indicated on his copy of the game board.<br/><br/>The navigators must sail through endless storms, blind to all around them, trying to gather clues to their whereabouts to stay on course. They also track the position of their ships on the game board, but the positions indicated are only a best guess &mdash; and they can become increasingly inaccurate as the game progresses.<br/><br/>The navigators must use their wits to stay on course and reach the Sacred Island before the end of the game, while Poseidon wins by preventing them from reaching their destination.<br/><br/>",

The game's centerpiece is an options system that lets the Allied player trade Victory Points for changes to his armies and policies that might (or might not) have changed history. Can you, as the Allied commander, repel the Germans with the forces on hand in 1940? How about if you train them better? Or give them a better command structure? Or provide them with more and better anti-aircraft an anti-tank guns? What do you think is the key to victory in the west? Can you, as the German commander, still beat the Allies if the French Army is motorized like the BEF? And how does your strategy change if the French don't build their Maginot Line, but do build a bigger and better air force? Do you still try to sneak through the Ardennes forest with your Panzers? Or do you ignore Allied bombers and wheel across the open plains of northern Belgium in a repeat of the 1914 Schlieffen Plan? Or do you do the unexpected and land a left hook through the Alsace? Your commanders await your orders. The future of Europe is in your hands.<br/><br/>10 May, 1940 ... The German Wehrmacht opened its long-awaited campaign in the West by smashing across the frontiers of Belgium and Holland. For the German High Command, it was seen as a daring move. Hitler's fledgling legions faced the combined armies of France, Britain, Belgium and the Netherlands. These Allied forces had more and better weapons of almost every type, and at least two of the opposing armies, those of France and Britain, were considered to be the best in the world. The Germans had the element of surprise and the new Blitzkrieg tactics of mobile warfare.<br/><br/>Six weeks later, it was all over. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) had been driven from the continent and the French, Belgians, and Dutch had all capitulated. Hitler had achieved a victory in the west, and the world would never be the same.<br/><br/>But, what if? It didn't have to happen that way ... Bad generalship and correctable flaws in their armies hastened the Allied defeat. What if the High Command had bothered to stay in radio contact with its armies on the frontier? And had then reacted promptly to the developing situation? What if the Maginot Line had been extended to cover the Meuse crossings at Sedan where Guderian's Panzers broke into the Allied rear? What if the BEF had included a strong British mobile corps that could have fought Rommel's Panzers on even terms at Arras? What if the French had prepared to meet the Blitzkrieg by building eight tank divisions instead of three? Or by mechanizing their cavalry the way the Germans did after the Polish campaign? Or even by developing their own blitzkrieg doctrine? The Allies could have taken any or all of these actions, and any of them would have altered the campaign's course.

It&rsquo;s a race, but being the first to complete these challenges won&rsquo;t be enough to claim victory! Ultimately, the winner will be the player who has earned the most points from their cards, cubes and bonuses they gained by cleverly doing maths.<br/><br/>Hercules is played over several rounds. Each round consists of 3 phases:<br/>1. Consult the Oracle (All players simultaneously roll their dice)<br/>2. Perform an Action (each player takes their turn and decides which action they wish to take: Perform a Labour or Rest)<br/>3. Move Pegasus (the Pegasus card moves to the next player on the left. That player will start the next round)<br/><br/>During the action phase, players may use the abilities of the Demigod and Gods of Olympus cards they previously won to adjust the dice results as permitted by spending cubes or flipping cards face down.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as any Apprentice reaches Column 12 (that Apprentice immediately wins the Zeus card). Any player(s) who have not yet taken their turn do so, so that all players have the same number of turns. The player with the most VP wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description:<br/>In the year 42BCE, a mysterious magical force was unleashed upon an unsuspecting world. The miasmic shockwave of pure otherworldly magic spread outward from a point somewhere in the middle east, and in a few short hours plunged the entire globe into chaos. In those terrible moments, human civilization changed forever. <br/><br/>Magic infused their very bones, manifested in their children, came unbidden to the fingertips of their women, and plagued their countryside in uncontrolled bursts of power. Ordinary beasts of the wilderness were turned by these bursts into fanciful creatures of legend. Entire tribes of humans from all corners of the world were altered by the flood of uncontrolled magic, changing before the very eyes of their friends and neighbors into elves, dwarves, orcs, trolls, centaurs, and even minotaurs. Creatures that normally existed between our reality and others were shunted into this one, leaving ghosts, faeries, and other magical creatures stranded in our world in ways they were never intended to be. Even remnants of the Old World, gods of the ancients and their ken, were awakened from their immortal slumber through this great cataclysm to trouble mankind once more.<br/><br/>The world had changed forever.<br/><br/>The year is now 37BCE and the middle-east sits at the center of a vast struggle to control humanity&rsquo;s fate. Three powerful nations have harnessed the power unleashed by the day of chaos, and they struggle to claim dominance over the known world. Their arcane legions are now yours to control.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>If you ever wondered what happened to the guys from WizKids just take a look at this game and you will know what they have been doing with the downtime after WizKids closed their doors.<br/><br/>Players each field &quot;bases&quot; of variable sizes (Sortie/small and Formation/large) with individual figures inserted into starting positions on the base. The goal is to control victory point areas and inflict losses on the opponent. Movement and battle resolution are conducted through a unique formation management mechanic that allows players to move figures around on the unit bases to increase either movement/melee/ranged combat at the cost of losing capabilities in the other areas.<br/><br/>Currently wrapping up play-testing as of May 2009. Arcane Legions will be available in September of 2009. Initially, look for 3 different factions (Egyptians, Romans, and Han Dynasty).<br/><br/>Figures are highly detailed true 25mm made from PVC 105. Common figures are unpainted with colored tempo prints on banners and shields, while all the uncommon, rare and Commander figures (Booster Pack contents) are fully pre-painted. The game is designed to use both types. There are 9 different unpainted common figures for each faction and at least 20 different fully painted premium figures for each faction. If you buy a legion bundle of a faction you receive around 70 prepainted figures, whereas buying one of each army pack gets you about 54 unpainted figures.<br/><br/>With more than 110 figures, the Starter Pack includes small armies for all three factions and enough formation bases, sortie bases and base cards for a complete two player game.  The Army Packs contain 40 common soldiers.  The Cavalry Packs contain 15 mounted figures.  The Booster Packs contain 5-10 (depending on the size) Leader / special figures and their associated base cards, plus five additional formation base cards for use with figures from the Army and Cavalry Packs.<br/><br/>All Arcane Legions products (with the exception of the Starter) can be purchased faction specific.<br/><br/>",

Plastic pigs are placed on a track made from cards laid in a circle, and then players are given cards in the colors of the pigs.  Each turn, a player selects a card, and moves the corresponding pig one space forward.  If the space in front is occupied by another pig, then the moving pig 'leapfrogs' that, and this can continue until the pig takes the lead, which gives the active player a food card.  Play goes on like this until all cards for the round have been played, however in order to keep the food (points) you collect during a round, your final movement for the round must score some more food.<br/><br/>Ages 6 and up<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Iberian Railways, you start with nothing but hope and a willingness to take on debt in order to construct railways that connect towns and cities across the Iberian peninsula.<br/><br/>The game board depicts Spain and Portugal, with towns, &quot;minor&quot; cities, &quot;major&quot; cities, Lisbon, and Madrid (collectively called &quot;urban hexes&quot;) being color-coded on a hex-based map. The board includes four action spaces &mdash; start, expand, merge, purchase &mdash; with all players starting on expand. On a turn, you must move your action marker to a new action, then either take that action or pass. The actions in brief:<br/><br/>&bull; Start a new railway: Place cubes on the map to connect at least two urban hexes, increasing your income $1-6 for each urban hex that you connect to. All hexes outside of Madrid can have at most two cubes on them. Players can place at most three cubes at the start of the game, with this limit increasing by one after each build to a maximum of eight. Placing cubes costs $3-52 to place 1-8 cubes, with additional costs for building in river and hill hexes and a hex where someone else is already located &mdash; but you start with no money, so if you have no cash on hand, you must take loans (each worth $5) to cover these costs.<br/><br/>&bull; Expand a railway: Connect one or more urban hexes to one of your existing railways, paying costs based on the number of cubes you place, taking loans if needed, then gaining income based on what you connect to.<br/><br/>&bull; Merge two or more of your railways: Place one or more cubes to combine one or more of your railways into a single railway, then increase your income by $1 (or possibly more if you've placed cubes on new urban hexes as part of the merger).<br/><br/>&bull; Purchase a business interest: Spend $3-5 to acquire an available business interest card. All of the minor and major cities, along with Lisbon, have one, and if you build a railway into this urban hex (or have already done so), flip this card face down, then add the cost of the card to your income.<br/><br/>After you complete an action or pass, you receive your current income from the bank, pay interest on your loans (taking additional loans if needed), optionally pay off one of your loans for $6, then see whether the game ends because you've placed your final cube on the game board. Once the game ends, points are awarded for certain categories of growth, with each player being awarded in case of a tie. Whoever has the most cash on hand receives 2 points, and 1 point is awarded for each of the following: highest income, longest continuous run of track, most business interests, most towns in overall network, most minor cities in overall network, and most major cities in overall network. Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The sands of time sweep across the ages, burying the cities and monuments of civilizations, leaving only whispers of the glory of ancient societies.<br/><br/>The Sands of Time is a civilization-building game set loosely in classical antiquity, on a board inspired by a Roman-era map.  Each player rules over a civilization in the ancient world, attempting exploits that will be remembered long after the civilization has withered. Each turn, players will select two action cards, which represent edicts delivered by the player to his populace, announcing what aspects of the empire he/she wishes to address:  building structures, implementing advances, migrating population, initiating combat, annexing new territories, instituting reforms to manage the empire&rsquo;s unrest, building trade routes, demanding tribute, and -- crucially &ndash;- recording Chronicles about his/her reign.<br/><br/>The central element of the game's scoring system, Chronicle cards represent claims of great accomplishments.  To score a chronicle, the player must have a &quot;heritage&quot; level commensurate with the claim he/she is making:  claims of great works will only be believed and perpetuated if the player's civilization has established a reputation in the relevant civilization category (cultural, civil, or political).<br/><br/>Actions generally require the payment of resources (crops or gold), and action costs correlate either to the player's empire size or the player's Unrest level.  Unrest increases when a player's territories become too crowded, or when a player re-uses an action card, or when a player voluntarily presses on his populace to squeeze additional productivity out of them.  Managing Unrest is a central concern for the player throughout the game.<br/><br/>Players must strike the right balance between competition and peaceful interaction with their neighbors, to propel their civilizations from insignificant, forgettable kingdoms into empires worthy of the attention of historians!<br/><br/>",

From Madonna and mullets to moonwalks and Monday Night Football, this party game isn't about what you know, but how you show it.<br/><br/>Here's how it works: Each turn, the opposing team draws a clue card and assigns points to each of the five activity choices, according to how hard they think each one will be. If they pull the &quot;Red Bull&quot; card, they may think drawing it is easy, so they'd give it one point. But acting? Hard. Five points! Now it's up to you to decide: Will you go for the easy points and draw, or go for the big points (and glory) by acting it out?<br/><br/>Each turn you get to choose to act, draw, hum, sculpt, or use letter cubes to get your team to guess the clue. With songs, celebrities, fads, fashions, TV shows, movies, and more, Pop 5 cards include all kinds of fun pop culture clues that span the decades -- and every turn, you get to choose how to get your team to guess!<br/><br/>* Would you act out Iron Chef or draw it?<br/>    * Would you rather hum a Spice Girls song or roll the letter cubes to give clues that start with the letters that come up?<br/>    * Would you choose to sculpt a Chia Pet out of clay or hum the jingle?<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a hand of random flower cards, and each card has a number on it corresponding to the number of that type of flower in the deck. Unlike in most other card games, you can't rearrange the order of cards in hand, so you must use them in the order that you've picked them up from the deck &mdash; unless you can trade them to other players, which is the heart of the game.<br/><br/>On a turn, you must plant the first one or two cards in your hand into the &quot;fields&quot; in front of you. Each field can hold only one type of flower, so if you must plant a type of flower that's not in one of your fields, then you must harvest a field to make room for the new arrival. This usually isn't good! Next, you reveal two cards from the deck, and you can then trade these cards as well as any card in your hand for cards from other players. You can even make future promises for cards received right now! After all the trading is complete &mdash; and all trades on a turn must involve the active player &mdash; then you end your turn by drawing cards from the deck and placing them at the back of your hand.<br/><br/>When you harvest flowers, you receive coins based on the number of cards in that field and the &quot;meter&quot; for that particular type of flower. Flip over 1-4 cards from that field to transform them into coins, then place the remainder of the cards in the discard pile. When the deck runs out, shuffle the discards, playing through the deck two more times. At the end of the game, everyone can harvest their fields, then whoever has earned the most coins wins.<br/><br/>",

Features a two-level game board and full-color acrylic standees for each Mole!<br/><br/>Mountains Out Of Molehills is played over six rounds, and each round has four phases. In Phase 1 players take turns drafting action cards from a face up market to form a hand of 4 cards each. These actions will move Moles underground while adding Molehill pieces to the bottom of the Mountains above them.<br/><br/>In Phase 2, each player simultaneously determines the order they plan to resolve their action cards, they place these cards face down in a stack from first action, to last. Once the order is set it cannot be changed! Carefully planning will help ensure you take control of the most valuable Molehills, but be careful as your opponents may block your path, throw a Rock in your way, or even cause your best Mountains to Topple over, spilling the pieces onto other Mountains!<br/><br/>In Phase 3 players take turns revealing the top card from their stack and resolving its action. In Phase 4 players score the round. Each player controls the Mountains that have their color Molehill on the bottom, and they earn 1 point for each piece in the Mountains they control.<br/><br/>After scoring, players draft the turn order for the next round, starting with the player who has the most pieces on TOP of each Mountain. The player who goes first gets first choice when drafting cards, but the player who acts last gets the final movement of the round.<br/><br/>After six rounds players total up all their points from the 6 rounds and the player with the most points is dubbed the Top Tunneler and wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Will you cooperate and split the money with others, or will you try to seize a room full of loot by yourselves? Use your skill to become the greatest and richest guild leader!<br/><br/>Each round in Dungeon Guilds, a new dungeon is created with face-down room cards equal to the number of players. The rooms are initially sorted by the threat level of the room, with Lv 1 rooms on top and Lv 3 on the bottom. Players take turns placing their adventurers in any dungeon room with a free space, by paying a fee, they can steal a space from other players. They keep placing until everyone has placed two adventurers, and each room has exactly two adventurers placed on it.<br/><br/>Players then reveal the rooms starting from the top of the dungeon and check whether the players can defeat the monsters in that room. If they succeed, then the owners of those adventurers split the money in that room evenly; if not, then excursions to the current room and all rooms below it are consider failed, and players must pay a healing cost for all adventurers.<br/><br/>Dungeon Guilds lasts for a fixed amount of dungeons, and the player with the most money at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

One of the players plays the role of informant and knows the truth about the case: They know which secrets need to be discovered and try their best to help you guess them correctly. The clock is ticking and the clues are scarce, so question the informant to gather useful information and find the solution. If you grope in the dark, the informant can reveal an important clue, but this will cost you precious time! Use your best observing eye, lateral thinking, and deduction skills to unravel all the mysteries of the ambiguous characters that populate this game.<br/><br/>3 Secrets comes with a free app available for download at the Apple AppStore and Google Play.<br/><br/>",

While there are plenty of other ETO games out there, The Supreme Commander effectively models all of the primary aspects of the war in a simple, straight-forward manner.<br/><br/>Murmansk convoy, Lend-Lease, diplomacy, the strategic U-Boat campaign, technological advancement, strategic bombing campaigns, naval invasions, the economy and military production, partisans &ndash; All of these elements and more are included in a surprisingly easy-to-learn game.<br/><br/>That is not to say that The Supreme Commander is some sort of compromise, surrendering historical accuracy for simplicity. The game delivers a detailed order of battle and meticulously researched economic and diplomatic system which allows players to play out the historical military campaigns of the war as well as the &ldquo;what ifs&rdquo; that may have happened. It is entirely up to the players &ndash; the system is open-ended and does not restrict players to the exact decisions of the past.<br/><br/>Play time will vary, but the campaign game generally will be a weekend long game that will rarely play the same way twice.<br/><br/>A campaign game and two shorter scenarios are included.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>Rulebook<br/>Two 22&quot;x34&quot; maps<br/>Diplomatic Track (cardstock)<br/>2 Player aid cards<br/>Two countersheets<br/>6 x Force Pool cards for France, UK, US, USSR, Italy, Germany<br/>Two 10-sided dice<br/><br/>TIME SCALE     1.5 months per turn<br/>MAP SCALE     60 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE     Corps and Armies<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS   2 to 5<br/><br/>DEVELOPER: Paul Marjoram<br/>MAP and COUNTER ART: Charlies Kibler<br/>ART DIRECTOR &amp; PACKAGE DESIGN: Rodger B.

Yesterday, a Polish 303 Squadron pilot out on a training flight shot down a German bomber. Consequently, the RAF command, which has practically no more reserves, has decided to send this Polish unit into combat. Eager to fight, the pilots have been waiting impatiently for this order.

        "description": "(second edition, TG552)<br/><br/>Inspired by the Book of Kells and its mesmerizing patterns woven amongst the vellum pages, Project Kells evolved.  Standing atop the Hill of Tara and contemplating the conjoined ringforts of Forradh and Teach Chormac, the games of Sacred Hill and High Kings of Tara were born.  Steeped in the ancient legends of Ireland&rsquo;s Celtic heritage and royal past, these unique games of pure strategy are appreciated by young and old alike.<br/><br/>Tailten Games won the Games Magazine award for BEST ABSTRACT GAME 2006; the  Spiele f&uuml;r Zwei - Spiele Akademie 2005 (Austria); Index 100 - Showcase 2005 in Ireland; and the award for 'Best Irish-Style Traditional Gift' 2005 in Ireland for Project Kells.<br/><br/>According to the designer, Murray Heasman,&quot;The game takes five minutes to learn, yet a lifetime to master.&quot; The sheer beauty of this game alone makes it a gift to treasure--but the three separate games  each pose a daunting task for any strategic or abstract gamer.<br/><br/>In all there are eight variants to stimulate the mind, so take it to your own level.  From a more simple Sacred Hill, a go-like game with its' elemental challenges, to an all-out-brain-burner in the form of Poisoned Chalice... Project Kells combines the best of beauty, gameplay, theme, and replay value.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll be amazed at the possibilities.  Once you&rsquo;ve learned the basics, be prepared to delve deeper, because you&rsquo;re likely to be already hooked on this game.  Scoring with knots (instead of kingdoms) will get you addicted.<br/><br/><br/>     This first game: Sacred Hill introduces the basic elements of play.  The aim of both games is the same -- to have the least number of kingdoms by the time the game is ended, a kingdom being a group of linked ring forts.  There are two phases to the game.  In manoeuvres (first phase) you are building a network of unconnected ring forts scattered around the board.  In Battle (second phase) you are adding ring forts next to your own, linking them together with bridge tiles, to form larger (and fewer) kingdoms.  This starts to magically create the Celtic knotwork.  Isolated ring forts that are besieged must be captured.  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.===<br/>     The second game:  High Kings of Tara introduces the kings.  Each player has three which do the work of building your ring forts. They move like the knight in chess and add many more twists and turns to the game, taking it to another dimension.  Kings can capture enemy ring forts and kings; they can also be immobilized.  Your own kings cannot work in tandem and they must always move to a vacant hill whenever possible.  Ties are possible, but the duality of scoring pursuits (ringforts versus captured kings) usually prevents this possibility.  This is especially true in tournament scoring...<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Those who feel that they have mastered those variants are encouraged to try the real brain burner of the bunch.  Poisoned Chalice  Played at right angles to each other, each player tries to exert total control over each other from a position of inferiority. The end scoring is the same as in the Sacred Hill variant, but in this endeavor the limitations of placement create challenging strategic obstacles for both opponents.  It is possible to exert control over an opponent in such a way that at times they are limited to one possibility for tile placement.  However, there are twists that occur if a piece is captured (surrounded) on the board (like in 'go').  No ties are possible with either ringfort scoring or knot scoring.<br/><br/><br/>This is very probably the same game [system] as The High Kings of Tara.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Violet and the Grumpy Nisse, one player is Violet and the other is Torech, the very grumpy nisse (a creature from Nordic folklore similar to a gnome) who has been kicked out of every single household in the village and taken shelter in the woods, which he claimed as his own domain.<br/><br/>Now, Violet is setting out to meet with her friend Ordep, the friendly troll, a journey that takes her right through the woods that Torech has claimed for himself. After being kicked out of the village, Torech cannot stand the idea of a human invading his home, let alone a human who is friends with a troll! So he is out to make Violet's journey as unpleasant as he possibly can, playing all sorts of tricks on her.<br/><br/>Violet and the Grumpy Nisse is a two-player trick-taking game. Players take different approaches on how to play this game depending on who they are playing as:<br/><br/><br/>    Violet has control over the pacing of the game, but is also more vulnerable to losing tricks as she has to manage her lantern, making sure it's always fueled so that she doesn't get lost in the darkness of the woods at night. She also wasn't expecting a nisse to cross her path; this can be scary, and she has to manage her fear so not to be overwhelmed by her own paranoia.<br/>    Torech has very little control over the pacing of the game, but he does has a few tricks up his sleeve. As Violet's fear of him increases, he becomes bolder and sets out more and more traps that make it harder for Violet to reach her friend. Also, unlike Violet, losing a trick is not nearly as bad for Torech as it is for Violet. He, after all, is the master of tricks!<br/><br/><br/>The game ends with a win for Violet if she reaches the end of her journey. Torech wins if Violet's lantern runs out of fuel, or if her fear sneaks up on her before she gets to Ordep.<br/><br/>What's unique about this trick taking game:<br/><br/>     It's highly thematic and instead of keeping track of scores on a pad, you will have Violet's pawn advancing on a map, that displays her progress and how close/far she is from winning the game.<br/>     Torech has two tracks on the board he will be focusing on and that display how close/far he is from winning the game: Violet's fear, which he threatens with each trick he successfully plays on her (wins), and Violet's Light track, which he wants to run out as quickly as possible so that she gets lost.<br/>     Trump will change over the course of a game as Violet journeys through the different parts of the landscape. Because Violet controls the pacing, she will be able to speed through them, or stay for a little longer to take advantage of a certain suit.<br/>     Most cards have a special ability, however, a card's ability is triggered only if it isn't used as a trump (trump is determined by Violet's location on the map).<br/>     Thanks to the many different traps Torech can use, each game will have different events play out at different timings, depending on how early Violet becomes a victim of her own fears.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The new Chinese Emperor Wei Zu Yang is still too young to rule. His advisors hope to strengthen their influence throughout the imperial palace &ndash; better known as the Forbidden City.<br/><br/>In turn in Forbidden City, the advisors place down room tiles in an attempt to close off the rooms when their influence is the biggest. To increase their power, they also need as many imperial dragons as possible on their side. The advisor with the most influence in the Forbidden City wins this exciting game of power!<br/><br/>During your turn, you play the tile from your face-down pile and place it face up on the table. You may place your tile only against a tile of the same color, unless they are divided by a wall. When you close off a room &mdash; that is, when it's completely surrounded by walls with or without archways &mdash; you calculate its total value. Each tile forming part of the room generates 1 point, each dragon in the room generates 3 bonus points, and any other rooms directly accessible from the closed off room through an archway are also added to the score.<br/><br/>The player with the most advisors in a closed-off room receives the total value in Chinese coins. The player who has the second-most advisors in the closed off room receives half the total score. In the event of an uneven total score, the amount is rounded down. If there are two or more players with the most advisors in the closed off room, each of these players is awarded half the total value.<br/><br/>The player who has the highest amount in coins at the end of the game is the most powerful advisor of the Forbidden City and therefore wins the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Then he/she has to assign the drawings to the other players. For each right guess the guessing person gets another point, otherwise the person who got another but her own drawing gets one point.<br/>You can play as long as you want.

If the sum of the cards on display now totals more than twelve, however, you must pick up all of the cards on display. Gameplay continues until the deck runs out, then the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The northerly route was chosen for the invasion, passing through Ciudad Rodrigo and Almeida. The French offensive began at the end of June. On 24 July, Marshal Ney with the advance guard defeated General Craufurd under the walls of Almeida and threw him back across the Co&acirc; River, as a prelude to laying siege to the place. The French then penetrated into Portugal. Their advance was slow and difficult. As for Wellington, he drew up his army in the formidable position of Bussaco. On 27 September, Mass&eacute;na ordered a frontal attack upon the English line of defense. After a bitter struggle he gave up the attempt and broke off the attack. It would take until the next day to find a way to turn the position at Sierra de Bussaco. With these two battles the terrible duel between Mass&eacute;na and Wellington had begun!<br/><br/>Almeida and Bussaco 1810 are the 30th and 31st battles of the Jours de Gloire series.

He was able to trial 40 scenario proposals before settling on the set provided.

Players combine dice to target and remove zombies from an ever-advancing horde before their barricade is overrun.<br/><br/>The game is suitable for all ages and abilities, and can be played in as little as 15 minutes (in the shorter version). The key game mechanics involve manipulating the numbers rolled on the dice via combinations of mathematical functions (from basic addition and subtraction through to squaring and cube rooting) to hit the exact numbers on the encroaching zombie cards - you need a precise head shot to take them out! As a co-op game, the difficulty can be tailored to suit the skills of the players, and supports groups of mixed abilities well.<br/><br/>Originally developed to assist the designer's daughter with her maths, the game has fantastic learning potential for players. It offers number manipulation skills by stealth rather than in a more traditional overtly &quot;educational&quot; game setting. What was designed with educational intent has become a great game for gamers and their families, and suits more experienced groups as a good warm-up or end of night filler.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from Zoch:<br/><br/>In the province of Salamanca, in the heart of Spain, there is plenty of activity. It is the middle of the 16th Century and young, ambitious noble families are reclaiming the dry hinterlands, building fields, forests, and lakes around their castles. Piece by piece - parcel by parcel - their holdings increase. Farmers work the fields, and in especially successful areas, monks found their influential cloisters. But everything happens under the watchful eyes of the nobility. Intrigues are hatched, tax collectors fleece the landowners, and far too often entire tracts of land are lost to locust plagues. Only he who keeps a cool head will become the Duke of Salamanca.<br/><br/>Through clever use of cards in hand, players obtain tiles for placement (buildings, landscapes, privileges) as well as the ability to carry out certain actions. The tiles obtained are placed on tactically important spaces on the game board. Players can also place ownership markers onto buildings. By cleverly placing landscape tiles adjacent to the proper buildings, valuable regions can be formed that will bring in doubloons. Through the actions that can be gained by playing cards, players can bring plague stones (among other things) onto the board, and thereby block their opponents' tiles. The winner is the player with the most doubloons at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

You can switch your alignment during the game though, too.<br/><br/>The amount of luck involved in this game is very low. Combat is deterministic with hidden information (no dice are used).<br/><br/>Further features:<br/><br/><br/>     Many paths to victory, from peaceful to warlike.<br/>     Alignment determines how you can interact with other players: &ldquo;Light&rdquo; (STO) factions can ally with advanced civilizations encountered but may not interfere with primitive civilizations, are peaceful towards other STO players, are peaceful with STS players unless attacked first. &ldquo;Darkness&rdquo; (STS) factions can be as peaceful to aggressive as they wish, and are able to subjugate primitive planets.<br/>     Develop your civilization in across five different technology fields: Military, Spirituality, Propulsion, Robotics and Genetics. Those who are committed a single area of specialty are rewarded with epic powers, at the highest level.<br/>     Cooperate with other players by trading technologies.<br/>     Choose from 17 unique factions, each with a unique power, sometimes even two (one for each alignment).<br/>     Fog of war creates uncertainty by hiding fleets with their tactical options and advantages. Fleets have advantages over others in a Rock-Paper-Scissors fashion.<br/>     Secret objectives give each player a surprise power, while encouraging different avenues of play.<br/>     Highly variable game setup that influences objectives.<br/>     A detailed and rich background story, based on testimony from secret space program whistle-blowers, UFO/ET witness accounts and channeled material.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trailblazers are the gutsy folks who pave and brave the trails of the great outdoors.&nbsp; Whether by hiking boots, cycling wheels, or river paddle, these tenacious travelers seek to feed their insatiable appetite for adventure.&nbsp; With a scenic wilderness ever ahead and a freshly charted path upon the heels, one mustn&rsquo;t forget to eventually find their way back to camp.&nbsp; For there are always new environments to explore, further expeditions to undertake, and more trails to blaze.<br/><br/>In Trailblazers, players compete to earn the most points by building biking, hiking, and kayaking loops from their campsites of the matching trail type.  Each round, players are dealt eight trail cards where they&rsquo;ll draft two cards, arrange those cards in their personal area, and pass their hand to the next player three times.  Cards must either be placed adjacent to or overlapping other cards.  While players can push their luck by aiming to construct long and elaborate trails, only closed loops that start and end at a matching campsite will score points.  Players also compete to fulfill &ldquo;First To&rdquo; and &ldquo;End Game&rdquo; goal cards.  After four rounds, the game ends and the player with the most points from closed loops and goal cards wins.<br/><br/>The Super Travel Edition of Trailblazers plays up to 4 players and includes PVC cards, the clamshell case, and carabiner.  It does not include any expansions.  There is one solo mode. Another version of this edition exists as the &quot;Pocket Edition&quot; which features the same game content but instead comes in a tuck box with regular cards.<br/><br/>(The Standard and Deluxe editions play up to 8 players, include the Animals and Adventures expansions, and have three solo modes. The Travel Edition includes the Animal expansion, but it does not have PVC cards)<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a unique airship with a crew of pioneers. Players manage the actions of these pioneers each turn in an effort to scout the land, gather resources, construct townships, and even battle it out in aerial combat. Creating geographic patterns via tile placement, the players will develop a new world each time they play. Players compete to be the first to score the required number of victory points to win the game. Points are scored by building townships, completing geographic patterns, and fighting their rivals in airship battles!<br/><br/>Every turn, players must carefully manage the actions of five workers, which can be assigned the following tasks:<br/><br/><br/>    Piloting the Airship - Moving their airship token around the board.<br/>    Research &amp; Development - Drawing map cards with geographic patterns and discovering development cards to improve their airships.<br/>    Scouting the Land - Drawing terrain tiles to place on the map to expand the community game board.<br/>    Gathering Resources - Landing the airship and exiting the workers to collect food, wood, stone and gold, with these resources being used to improve the performance of workers and to build townships.<br/>    Construct a Township - Landing the airship and disembarking the workers to build a township, which provides a reoccurring resource stream and is worth victory points.<br/>    Aerial Combat - Engaging in airship battles with other players to slow their progress and potentially score victory points.<br/>    Repair Ship Damage - Repairing the damage taken in battle.<br/><br/><br/>Fantasy Frontier is a unique gaming experience, blending a peaceful Euro play-style with the optional take-that element of combat, creating a game unlike any other.<br/><br/>",

All players go at the same time, and the game is played in rounds. Each round consists of four steps: Plan, Reveal, Attack, and End of Turn. Place an Attack card facedown pointed at the player you plan to attack. For a particularly strong opponent, you can choose to place a Boost card facedown along with your Attack card to increase damage and speed or give added effects to your Attack.<br/><br/>Cheap Tricks are especially powerful &ndash; they can send an opponent over the top rope or prevent Attacks from being blocked or dodged. All players reveal their Attack cards at the same time and the player with the fastest speed goes first. If the Legend you are attacking is unable to defend themselves, or if another player doesn&rsquo;t intervene with a Defense, Special, or Ref card in the case of a Cheap Trick, the Attack hits! The Attack and Boost cards played are then placed next to the Legend&rsquo;s placard, aligned with the damage icons. If the Legend sustains damage equal to or above his health, he is thrown over the top rope and eliminated. Draw up to six cards at the end of your turn&hellip;if you&rsquo;re still standing!<br/><br/>Wrestlers include Andr&eacute; the Giant, &ldquo;Macho Man&rdquo; Randy Savage, Jake &ldquo;The Snake&rdquo; Roberts, The Million Dollar Man, Batista, Sting, and more!<br/>Contents: 30 WWE Legend placards, 30 Signature cards, 1 WWE Legends token, and 150 Action cards including Kicks, Strikes, Moves, Cheap Tricks, and more!<br/><br/>",

The game ends once no one can capture any more dice. A player's score is the sum of the sides of the dice they captured, plus half the sum of the sides of dice they own that weren't captured. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>Button Men: Beat People Up is a new version of Button Men that depicts characters on cards instead of stickpin buttons, but the basic gameplay is the same, and characters from the different releases can still fight one another.<br/><br/>This game is set in Fight City, a 1950s gangster town somewhere on the Gulf Coast. The Fight City set is divided into four factions, each with a different style of play. Those from Downtown (&quot;The Core&quot;) use normal dice only. Characters from The West Side have Shadow dice, which make attacks upside-down. Those from the Delta region use Poison dice, which are worth negative points. And characters from the Hill (&quot;Uptown&quot;) have Rush dice, which give those characters more chances to make the first move.<br/><br/>",

The selection of a small scenario allows the novice to play within an hour of opening the box, with several scenarios also being optimal for solitaire play.<br/><br/>Rules come punched for a three ringed binder (not provided) for ease of use and photocopying. They follow the same format as our other rules used in the Trilogy, making them easy to follow for experienced gamers, and novices alike. Tactical turns represent 3 minutes, with intermediate turns (for long distance maneuvering and long stern chases) representing 30 minutes. Gun hit probability is based upon a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds firing at the target, and speeds of the firing and target platforms. Damage is a function of the type of shell, number of barrels firing and armor of target, and is easy to calculate also. Blank ship forms allow the player to list all the ranges and damages of his ship's particular guns in advance, making it quick and easy to calculate both damage and hit probability. Critical damage is a function of the amount of damage taken last round vs. the amount of damage able to be taken. Critical hits typically scored against systems (engineering, bridge, steering or individual weapon amounts).<br/><br/>The 40+ scenarios include the well known &quot;biggies&quot; such as Jutland (broken into three parts, as well as the grand battle) and Dogger Bank, and many smaller engagements. Often there are variants given, covering important &quot;almosts&quot; and &quot;what ifs&quot;. All aspects are covered, with ships provided for the Japanese, Turkish, Austrian, and Russian navies as well as the British and German fleets. The Data Annex includes all ship classes for the war and is a valuable reference by itself. So with this product, one need only Fear God &amp; Dread Nought!<br/><br/>",

Three times the Germans drove them back, until finally on 18 May 1944 a troop of Polish Lancers raised their red-and-white pennant over the ruins. Over 50,000 Allied soldiers and more than 20,000 Germans fell in the struggle for Monte Cassino.<br/><br/>Cassino '44 is a complete boxed game in the Panzer Grenadier series by David Murray, covering all four of the battles. From the initial American assaults through the final Polish conquest, every stage of the battle is depicted in scenario form with two lengthy campaign games covering the entire affair.<br/><br/>Forces involved include the tough American 36th &quot;Texas&quot; Division, the 4th and 8th Indian Divisions including Gurkha battalions, the 2nd New Zealand Division with its brigade of Sherman tanks and elite Maori Battalion, and the hard-fighting exiles of the Polish II Corps.  On the German side, the 1st Parachute Division was probably the best formation the Axis put into the field in World War II, and it's assisted by the 15th Panzer Grenadier Division and other formations.<br/><br/>This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>",

Brave and wicked alike are drawn to powerful relics lost in the ruins of the ancient world.<br/><br/>The characters are represented on the board by detailed 30mm miniatures while their statistics and abilities are shown on convenient character cards.   The real tactical depth comes in as players choose from dozens of unique upgrades to specialize their characters to gain a tactical advantage. Will you choose to specialize your druid as a support healer, or upgrade her bear form into a DPS monstrosity?<br/><br/>Battles are fought over an unidentified magic item that has drawn the characters to that spot. When characters are finally able to seize the relic it is drawn randomly from the Relic Deck. Relics grant an unnatural boon and are used just like upgrades, however they far surpass any upgrade in power. But if the character wielding the relic is disabled anyone can pick it up.<br/><br/>Standard games of Relicblade are played on a 2'x2' area, and players usually only field between three and six characters. Standard games usually last around 45 minutes. Relicblade is fast paced, dynamic, and fun.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This new GMT boxed version of 1918/1919: Storm in the West is a two-player system that also works fine for solo play.  Units are mostly corps (divisions for the USA, whose oversized units were nearly the size of Allied corps), and include infantry, tanks, cavalry and air support. The Germans start the 1918 campaign with large numbers of Stosstruppen, trained to overcome the trench stalemate of the previous  three years. This gives the German player a strong offensive capability in the first half of the game. But these &ldquo;shock troops&rdquo; are a wasting asset, and if the Allies survive the initial blows, growing numbers of US troops and Allied tanks will see the Germans forced into a desperate defense in the game's second half.<br/><br/>In the Plan 1919 campaign, the Germans are assumed to have used the collapse of Russia to stabilize the Balkan and Italian fronts, forgoing the historical 1918 Kaiser's Battles in the West. The Allies are thus faced with a strong German defense, but with a fully mobilized American army and backed by masses of tanks and planes.  This hypothetical campaign challenges the Allies to leverage these arms into the world's first blitzkrieg, while the Germans fight to force a stalemate that will leave them dominant in Europe.<br/><br/>The large-hex map, scaled at 8 miles to the hex, covers the active area of the Western Front, from Epinal in the south to Antwerp and the Channel Coast in the north. Terrain includes Forts, Allied trenches, German Secondary and Primary Trenches, Forts, Forest, Marsh, Flood Plain, Mountain, and the Devastated Zone created by the German withdrawal in the Somme sector in 1917. The map is back-printed with separate versions for the 1918 and 1919 Campaigns.<br/><br/>Simple but not simplistic, this new GMT version of 1918/1919: Storm in the West can be played in a single session and offers players a wide range of strategic and operational choices in bloody but dynamic campaigns to decide the outcome of the First World War. With updated artwork by Mark Simonitch and Charlie Kibler, this new combined edition is a must for lovers of classic wargaming.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>The Seven Years' War Worldwide<br/><br/>Between 1756 and 1763, Europe erupted into what became the first true world-wide conflict, known as the Seven Years&rsquo; War. On the one hand, Britain and France vied for supremacy in world-wide trade, becoming deadly enemies in the process. On the other, Austria and Prussia struggled for dominance in Germany. On the fringes, Russia began to feel her growing power, while Spain, the Netherlands and Turkey all knew their time was almost up.<br/><br/>Soldier Kings re-creates the free-for-all that was the Seven Years&rsquo; War. Two to eight players take the roles of the nations listed above, trying to capture or hold onto the rich lands of Europe, India, South-East Asia and America. The world is changing; the power that grabs the most now will dominate the modern age that is just dawning. If you&rsquo;re the Soldier King, that power will be you.<br/><br/>In Soldier Kings, each player has armies and fleets. There are also a handful of generals and admirals to assist these in battle and in movement. The best is Frederick of Prussia, called &ldquo;The Great&rdquo; for a reason. The worst is the hapless Prince of Orange, with whom the Dutch player is saddled.<br/><br/>Players have allies; some are set at the beginning of the game, others alliances are forged during the course of play. Everyone else is an enemy. No one is &ldquo;neutral&rdquo;; those are just enemies you haven&rsquo;t attacked yet.<br/><br/>The map is divided into land areas and sea zones. Armies move on land, fleets at sea. Each land area is rated for the amount of money and manpower it generates each turn. Manpower represents not just fresh recruits for your forces, but also the things made with human labor: food, uniforms, weapons and so on. Money is, well, money. You expend manpower to rebuild your forces, and money to finance their actions. Thus you need to hang on to areas that generate these resources for you, and take them from the other guy.<br/><br/>You do that by defeating enemy armies, and besieging enemy areas. Combat is conducted by rolling dice, one for each attack factor. These hits must be sustained by enemy armies by reducing them in strength, or eliminating them. A good general lets you roll more dice. Each area is rated for its garrison strength; to capture it, you have to defeat the garrison troops through siege (in addition to driving off any enemy armies there). The procedure here is very similar.<br/><br/>Throwing a twist into all of this is card play. The universe is loaded with random elements; life does not unfold as an orderly series of &ldquo;phases.&rdquo; After a short countdown to start the game, players can play cards at any time, in any order.<br/><br/>The cards are the centerpiece of the game, giving it its free-wheeling nature. Generals can vacillate. Mercenaries can be hired. Local militia can appear to help. Soldiers might run off to loot. Bridges get burned, snow falls early, the harvests are bad, the harvests are good. Royal marriages, minor country alliances, the rise of new leaders &mdash; all sorts of events take place during card play.<br/><br/>The game contains seven scenarios: a campaign game covering the entire war, and then six shorter ones, one for each year of the war. Play ends on a pre-determined turn or when a player has achieved his or her conditions for automatic victory, whichever comes first.<br/><br/>",

Harsh customs rule the day. Five courageous tribes have set out to conquer new lands: the Huns, the Langobardens, the Goths, the Anglo Saxons, and the Vandals. As you seek new settlement areas for your tribe, you'll strengthen it by enlarging clans, establishing or conquering new countries, and building a powerful sea presence. Whoever scores the most points will stand far ahead of others on the tribe leader path and win the game.<br/><br/>Origo is a family game for 2-5 players from ages 10 and up, in which luck and tactics are mixed well. Depending on the number of players, the game duration is 30-90 minutes.<br/><br/>The flow of the game is driven by cards on the one hand (expanding, attacking) and by the movement of figures on the boards on the other (hiking, sailing). The player whose turn it is carries out the following actions in any sequence: expanding, attacking, hiking, sailing. Whoever occupies the final field in a country founds that country and receives points. There are further points in three large tribe evaluations during the game for the largest tribes, control of the seas, and control of the countries.<br/><br/>The game is, in many aspects, very similar to Captain Future<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players move along the map and explore new areas by laying down a card that represents a place on the map.  Exploration leads to new weapons, enemies that block the way, gold, magic spells, and a sneaky gnome that steals your gold.<br/><br/>Enemies are fought with a simple dice mechanic.  Each weapon and enemy rolls a single dice, and their power varies depending on the number of sides to the dice, from d4 to d20.  Each victory is rewarded with a number of gold pieces.<br/><br/>When someone gets close to leaving the Lost Woods, the Guardian appears to block the way, and provide a large amount of gold for anyone who can beat them.<br/><br/>The game ends when someone finds a way out of the Lost Woods.  The winner is the player with the most gold.  If players are tied, they must battle each other.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Featuring historic Japanese artwork, Martial Art is a card game of factions warring for dominance of feudal Japan. The game consists of a series of battles in which players must anticipate their opponents' actions, build their hands, and manage their cards to acquire enough land and power to defeat the other clans and win the game.<br/><br/>As clan leader, command your armies and muster forces to find the tools to conquer places of economic and cultural importance such as the capital Kyoto or the rising city of Edo. But to win takes more than foot soldiers. Provoke a peasant rebellion, influence the emperor to support your claim, or even distract the enemy commanders with lovely Geisha.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Broadhorns: Early Trade on the Mississippi players take the role of merchants based in St. Louis, financing cargo expeditions down the Mississippi River during the early part of the 19th century. The game is played over the course of a year through the varying seasons, each presenting its own challenge. During the game, the players will finance a number of trips. With each one they will need to obtain a boat (known as a broadhorn or flatboat) and purchase cargo. The player receives a higher return for their cargo the farther down the Mississippi they travel. Some of the cargo is perishable so time is of the essence. In addition, there are travelers willing to pay for passage down the Mississippi.<br/><br/>The players begin the game in St. Louis with a small amount of gold. They will be able to afford only the smallest of three sizes of broadhorns for their first expedition; when they have earned more gold they will choose between smaller faster broadhorns and larger broadhorns with more cargo room. They will load their broadhorns with cargo from five available types: apples, flour, pork, fur and whiskey.  Apples, flour and pork are perishable and the players have a limited time to deliver them before they spoil. The players may stop at any town along the way and deliver their cargo and purchase more, the farther down the river they sell their cargo the greater the return. Players may also pick up travelers at various towns to earn additional gold by taking them to their destination.<br/><br/>",

These factions must work together to overcome the Emperor, but only one will eventually rule the future country. Otherwise, Flaut III suppresses the revolution and retains control...<br/><br/>In Dark Empire: Revolution, each faction consists of a total of 13 cards: three cards with a value of 4-6 and two cards with values 7-8. There are ten additional cards which can be added to the strength of any faction card already in play. The table represents Vindoban, the capital of R`yan, where the emperor deploys his army on one side and the insurgent people gather on the other.<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of turns (&quot;weeks&quot;). After four weeks, a month is completed with an intermediate scoring, and after three months a final scoring ends the game.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a hand of seven cards, one random &ldquo;secret goal&rdquo; faction that the player attempts to guide to victory, and a set of &quot;temporary support&quot; cards. With these cards you secretly &ldquo;bid&rdquo; on the faction you believe will win the next month&rsquo;s scoring by having accumulated the most points.<br/><br/>Gameplay: players simultaneously place one card each in the centre of the table, either towards the revolutionary forces, or as a traitor on the emperor's side adding this value to an &ldquo;Emperor card&rdquo; already placed in that location. This happens three times, but you are only allowed to place one of your three cards as a traitor. The week is then resolved and the player who provided the most support for the strongest faction puts aside one of his cards for this faction to be scored; in addition, this player is immediately awarded 2 extra points. The player who played the highest single card for this faction (not necessarily the same player!) is awarded 1 point. But beware - when the emperor (his card plus all traitors) gained more points than each single faction, the Emperor card is placed to the scoring! The table is cleared and the next week begins. After four weeks, a month is over and an intermediate scoring takes place. If you are correct with your prediction of this month&rsquo;s winner you gain another 6 points.<br/><br/>After three months the final scoring occurs, determining the winner: the &ldquo;secret goals&rdquo; are revealed and the collected points of each player are added to the cards scored for their faction during the course of the game. The faction with the highest score wins the revolution - and the game. But: if the emperor can put down the rebellion - then the faction with the lowest score wins the game. Or, if the winning faction is too far ahead, it is immediately overthrown by all the others and the faction with the second highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854 gave new territories the right to &ldquo;popular sovereignty,&rdquo; allowing residents to choose whether or not to allow slavery. Within months the stream of settlers to Kansas was swelled by parties of sponsored abolitionists and pro-slavers, all more intent on fighting one another than building a new state. Bushwhacks and gun battles punctuated maneuvers by rival legislatures elected through massive fraud. It would not die out entirely until statehood in January 1861. The new state&rsquo;s senators swung the US Senate irretrievably against the South, ensuring the continuation of secession started by the election of Abraham Lincoln.<br/><br/>The core of the game is the card system. Each card describes an important event, person, or factor in the conflict, and triggers associated actions in the game. Players alternate card play to influence settlers, build forces, control counties, sway politics, move friendly forces, disrupt or attack opposing forces, burn or rebuild towns, encourage migration, or request Federal intervention. The sequence of cards played not only determines the outcome of the game, but creates the narrative of this dramatic conflict.<br/><br/>Take charge of your faction and gain control of Kansas.<br/><br/>",

Each game lasts around 20 minutes.<br/><br/>An adaptoid is a creature that constantly evolves to adapt itself to its surroundings. To survive it needs to be fed. In adaptoid, two armies of adaptoids must confront one another with the aim of eliminating all opponents.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 37-space hexagonal board. Each player receives a supply of adaptoid bodies in either white or black which are plastic discs with laser-cut sockets ready to receive one of the small pile of claws and legs in the colour of each player. The capabilities of each of the adaptoids varies through the game depending on how many and what type of appendage are added.<br/><br/>Each player turn has 3 phases: Movement, Growth and Feeding. In the movement phase, the player may move one of their adaptoids as many spaces as it has limbs. Adaptoids cannot move through occupied spaces, but they can move on top of an opposing adaptoid to initiate a capture.<br/><br/>In the growth phase the player must either spawn a new, empty, adaptoid next to one of their existing pieces or add a leg or a claw to any adaptoid already on the board.<br/><br/>In the feeding phase, every enemy piece is checked for starvation. An adaptoid requires space to graze equal to its number of limbs. Any enemy piece which has fewer empty spaces around it than limbs starves to death and is removed. Starving your opponent to death (or indeed having them incautiously starve themselves) is worth a point.<br/><br/>The resolution of capture move is simple. The adaptoid with the most claws wins and the other adaptoid is removed from the board. If both pieces have the same number of claws, both are removed with a point going to each player. Starved or captured pieces are returned to the supply ready for further use.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has either obtained 5 points by capturing and starving enemy adaptoids or has been completely eliminated from the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A solitaire board game that places the player in command of US submarines patroling the waters of the WWII Pacific Ocean. The goal is to sink enemy shipping, perform special missions, accumulate experience, and manage crew stress.<br/><br/>The American submarine campaign in the Pacific during World War II was a major contributor to the ultimate defeat of Japan. During the war, American submarines comprised less than two percent of the U.S. Navy, but sank almost 60 percent of the Japanese merchant marine and more than 30 percent of Japan's navy, including eight aircraft carriers. Gato Leader moves the Leader series to Pacific waters, letting players lead a group of American submarines against the Empire of Japan. The core system of the game is built on U-Boat Leader and will be familiar to players of other Leader games, allowing them to get into the game quickly. A major portion of the game is determining where to send your submarines. Do you send your boats to the distant, better-defended, merchant-rich Japanese Home Waters, or do you hit the convoys supplying the far-flung Japanese bases? You can spend Special Operations Points to upgrade your submarines, concentrate intelligence resources, and send your submarines on special missions, such as mine-laying and hunting the Imperial Japanese Navy.<br/><br/>When a patrolling submarine encounters an enemy force the action then shifts to the tactical display where the submarine tries to close with and attack merchants while avoiding the escorting warships. When an attack starts you will have an idea of the number and general type of ships in the group, but you have to close with the ships to identify the ships and decide which ones are worth firing torpedoes or guns at. In addition to fighting the enemy, your submarines also have to deal with your own torpedo problems, including dud torpedoes and ones that turn on your submarine.<br/><br/>Gato Leader includes the following U.S. Navy submarine types: <br/>S Class<br/>Narwhal Class<br/>Permit Class<br/>Salmon Class<br/>Tambor/Gar Class<br/>Gato/Balao/Tench Class<br/><br/>Gato Leader includes four campaigns covering different stages of the Pacific submarine war:<br/><br/>Holding the Line: Submarine operations from Australia during 1942<br/><br/>Against the Sun: Submarine operations from Pearl Harbor during 1942<br/><br/>Turning the Tide: Submarine operations from Australia and Pearl Harbor during 1943<br/><br/>Setting Sun: Submarine operations from Pearl Harbor during 1944 and 1945<br/><br/>Component List:<br/>165 Full Color Cards<br/>176 Full Color Counters<br/>Tactical Display Sheet<br/>Ship Display Sheet<br/>Player Aid Sheet<br/><br/>",

The sooner that a dragon captures an adventurer, the fewer points it's worth at the end of the round &mdash; and should an adventurer actually manage to escape, many points in treasure await.<br/><br/>In Drachenhort, players don't represent these adventurers themselves, but rather secretly back a trio of these adventurers. Each turn, the active player rolls a die and moves one of the adventurers further away from the dragon. After all of the adventurers have moved once, all of them are available for movement once again. Don't be too obvious about which adventurers you support, though, for others will drop traps in their path or otherwise hobble them to ensure that they become dragon food first.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, players score points based on how far their adventurers traveled, and after two rounds the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The game  system is not overly complex, but does feature money (taxing and expenditures), technology levels, and leaders (characters from the BattleTech continuity, who have multiple uses).<br/><br/>Note that despite what the box copy below implies, all five Houses are always in play. Playing with fewer than five players requires at least some players to play multiple Houses.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are in fact only two scenarios provided in the box, one for the Third (or possibly Fourth) Succession War, starting in 3025, and one for the First, starting in 2786.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>For over 200 years, the five Successor States of the near-legendary Star League have warred among themselves for dominion over the whole Inner Sphere. There have been three Succession Wars to date, but no victor. The cost of war is high. The leaders of the Successor States must weigh each maneuver to see whether the gain in territory is worth the loss of 'Mechs. Only the most ruthless and brilliant leader will emerge as the next Star Lord.<br/><br/>The Succession Wars is a 2- to 5-player game, where each player assumes the role of a House leader. All the most famous and infamous regiments of the BattleTech universe are at your command - the elite Kurita Sword of Light, the Davion Guards, and the mercenary unit Wolf's Dragoons. The game allows players to fight any Succession War, including the fourth, toward which the Inner Sphere is now building. The game system is simple and fast allowing strategy - not the rules - to be the deciding factor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An abstract 2-player game in which the objective is to create a line of 5 counters . The twist here is that the counters are placed in a series of 5 boards of differing size that are formed to make a pyramid, hence the name &lsquo;Quinamid&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The rules are simple, with any one of  3 options available to the player : <br/>a)    Place a counter in a vacant space<br/>b)    Rotate a board (including those boards &lsquo;above&rsquo; it) through 90 degrees<br/>c)    Move a board (including those boards &lsquo;above&rsquo; it) one &lsquo;position&rsquo; in any orthogonal direction.<br/><br/>An important rule is that the subsequent player may neither move NOR rotate a board which was moved or rotated by the preceding player.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to make their move until one of them reveals a line of 5 counters, this being in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal direction.<br/><br/>As players use option c) above they will &lsquo;cover&rsquo; boards below, thereby hiding the contents. It follows therefore that there is a bit of memory required to recall what was under the various boards if you are to use it to your advantage.<br/><br/>A game is often completed in 2 or 3 minutes so replay value is high. It is often better to play a &lsquo;best of 5&rsquo; series to employ different strategies, so that would take around 15 minutes.<br/><br/>The game should appeal to players aged 8-80. It could be played whilst waiting for a meal to be prepared or as a post-prandial diversion with other players spectating and giving out &lsquo;advice&rsquo; ! Easy until they themselves have a go !!<br/><br/>Components are sturdy, with the counters and boards being made of good quality wood, and the package comes in a nice wooden presentation box of dimensions 7&rdquo; x 7&rdquo;, making it portable and suitable to be played on the train, the beach or at picnics.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/>     Boardspace.net (real time, AI option)<br/><br/><br/>Mobile Apps<br/><br/>     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS<br/>     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "AIM OF THE GAME<br/><br/>Obtain magical points (MP) by preventing evil creatures from invading the human world. These creatures come from the underwater Ker-Ys city.<br/><br/>PREPARATION<br/><br/><br/>     In turn, the players place all elements of the game area (wall ruins, swamps).<br/>     Four creatures are introduced in the game and will progress from the door (in the centre of a glade) towards either side of the game board (representing the druids&rsquo; path surrounding the glade). Creatures&rsquo; moves are pre-defined and happen automatically.<br/>     The players place their team of three druids whose role is to prevent the creatures from invading the human world.<br/>     Energy markers are set at the start level and the knowledge track markers are set under the tracks.<br/>     The pile of Power cards is shuffled and placed near the board.<br/><br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>The game consists of a defined number of rounds (depending on number of players). Every round is composed of the following phases:<br/><br/><br/>     The creatures progress. The creatures already on the board progress towards the side of the board using a totally automatic way of moving. New creatures (1 to 3, depending on a dice roll) arrive on the board and start to progress too.<br/>     Preparation of the Action tiles. The six Action tiles are shuffled and placed one by one forming a line, face up. These tiles represent all possible actions, each tile being separated into a major and a minor action. The number of places available on the tiles depends on the number of players.<br/>     Choice of actions. Each druid team carries out 5 actions a round, represented by Action markers. Players, in the reverse order of their position on the score track, choose their actions one by one by setting their Action markers on the available places on the Action cards. Actions can be: moving the druids (they only move on the path surrounding the glade), setting a magical stone (a magical stone is set at the intersection of the magical beams emitted by two druids looking at the glade, this costs energy; the magical beams do not cross obstacles), capturing creature(s) (a druid may capture a creature in front of him with his magical beam; this costs energy but gives MP and sometimes special properties), progressing in knowledge tracks (to increase the capacity of moving, or to increase the influence at the druid council, for &shy;instance), preparing magical beverages (to increase knowledge but also to recover energy), moving a magical stone (it is possible to move a magical stone), acquiring Power cards (they give special powers, such as allowing the magical beam to pass through a wall), and influencing a creature (allows to move a creature).<br/>     Actions are performed. Actions are performed marker by marker, from left to right, starting with the major actions before doing the minor ones. If the same colour of marker is encountered a second time on the same action, this action is not carried out. The actions on the next Action tile are then carried out and so on, until all major or all minor actions have been performed. Then, the players come back to the stopped action to perform it. Druids must inform the council about all their actions. After they have set a stone, captured a creature, or prepared a magical beverage, druids are placed at the druid council. Any druid can start from the council to enter back the path, but he can also stay at the council to influence it and gain MP at the end of the round.<br/>     Activation of magical stones. At the end of each round, all stones that are aligned and of the same colour automatically become menhirs. MP are attributed to the corresponding players and depend on the distance between the stones that have been transformed, as well as their position in the glade. Menhirs have a special property that will be activated at the end of the game.<br/>     Druid council. At the end of each round, the influence of each druid team on the council is evaluated. Players receive as many MP as their number of druids at the council. In addition, the team in majority can increase his knowledge in one of the knowledge tracks.<br/><br/><br/>Then, a new round can start.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/><br/>The game is finished after 5 or 6 rounds, depending on the number of players. In addition to the MP gained during the game, players receive MP according to the magical stones still on the board and the Power cards still in their&nbsp;hands. <br/>Also, the final menhir layout is important and can afford MP according to two different scenarios. If the central door (from which the creatures come) can be completely shut in by drawing a connecting line between menhirs, then MP are attributed to the players for the menhirs they have placed in the glade. If it is not possible to shut in the central door by connecting menhirs, then MP are attributed to the players for the creatures that they have captured.<br/><br/>THE WINNER<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the highest MP score.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets a random hand of six movement cards and will play only four of them before the dragon's final position is settled.<br/><br/>Players individually deploy their three pawns (&quot;street sellers&quot;) somewhere along the red/yellow number line, one at a time after each of the first three cards played, in the effort to be nearest to the dragon once it stops moving.  Then coins (VP) are collected by each street seller depending on proximity to the dragon, the top payoff of 5 going only to the pawn on the exact same space.<br/><br/>You play as many hands as there are players, with each player going first once.

They place a sitting man figure somewhere in the maze.<br/><br/>During play, each player takes turns to call out steps along the opponents maze (blind) until they bump into a wall. They have a duplicate board on which they track their knowledge of the opponents hidden maze.

Players build teams out of five robots to duke it out against other players' teams of five. It's designed to be easy to learn, affordable to buy, and quick to play, setting it apart from other strategy games.<br/><br/>There are five different classes of robot: Assault, Evasive, Guard, Intel and Support, and dozens of robots in each of those Classes. Each Class has its own way of playing and interacting with other bots, and you can make a team out of any five of them for an infinite amount of possible strategies!<br/><br/>The main mechanism of the game is teambuilding. Each robot on your team shares energy with each other, so moving and attacking with one will limit what the rest of your team can do during your turn. Certain compatible robots can combine into greater forms, too! If your team is built correctly, you can unite all five of your robots together to form something right out of your favorite giant robot cartoon!<br/><br/>",

In the West, after the landing in Normandy and forcing German troops to withdraw from France, the armies of the Western Allies stand over the borders of the Reich, being ready to get across Rhine. In the East, mighty Red Army preparing itself to final offensive, which goal is the capital of Nazi Germany, Berlin. Both Allies are set for the race to ultimate victory.<br/><br/>Players take role of the commanders of the Soviet and Allied armies competing for prize winners: the capital of the Third Reich. Additionally, they command German armies, standing in front of their ally (player directing the Red Army commands German troops on the Western Front and player, who controls the Western Allies commands German troops on the Eastern Front), whose task is to delay their troops on its way to Berlin. In addition, the players has to seize the strategically important regions of Germany, which later will be administered by occupying troops.<br/><br/>Result of this race creates post-war spheres of influence by the winners of the Second World War, which influence the balance of power during the Cold War.<br/><br/>Game components<br/>- A map showing areas of Western and Central Europe, where the last battles of World War II took place in 1945.<br/>- Front line markers (2&times;25 pieces), to show the Western and Soviet front lines, which shifted during the operations.<br/>- Logistics blocks (2&times;8 pieces), which form the basis of players&rsquo; military maneuvers on the board.<br/>- Action cubes (2&times;20 pieces), to mark the number of actions made by a logistics block.<br/>- Military unit tokens (40 pieces) with historical markings of armies (Germany, Western Allies) or fronts (Red Army). In the game there are three forces: the Western Allies, the Soviets and the Germans. German units have a current strength, shown by their current orientation. A German unit&rsquo;s current strength is the number on the side facing west (for Western Front German units) or east (for Eastern Front German units). As a German unit takes losses, its block is rotated to show its new status. The West and the Soviets were allied in the war, but compete against each other as players in the game. Germany has no ally, and is divided into the Western Front and the Eastern Front.<br/>- Special action tokens (16 pieces), for use during combat.<br/>- Fortification tokens (16 pieces) in 3 types: improved positions, regular fortifications, and major fortifications. These represent important defensive lines, e.g. the Siegfried Line (Westwall), Pomeranian Wall, etc.<br/>- Victory point tokens (2&times;4 pieces) for areas of crucial importance for military operations (e.g. Essen, Breslau, etc.).<br/><br/>All game elements are limited by the physical amount provided.<br/><br/>",

When a druid is moved, he usually leaves a stone behind, and in this way stone circles are eventually created on the board. Each time a player gains the stone majority within such a circle, he places a dolmen with a hidden number (1 to 4) in its center. Over time, stacks of dolmen grow all across the board.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as any player runs out of dolmen or stones. For each dolmen a player has placed, he scores a number of points that depends on the dolmen's position within its stack as well as the size of the circle surrounding it.

        "description": "Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45 is an Eastern front strategic game set during World War 2, designed by Dave O'Connor.  Trial of Strength is a strategic level board wargame set in the Eastern Front of WWII, originally published by Panther Games in 1985.  A new second edition is being published by Lock 'n Load Publishing, LLC.<br/><br/>Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45 is a turn-based board wargame that puts the players in the shoes of armed forces commanders who must determine objectives, allocate forces and execute operations designed to achieve victory over your opponent.  The battlefield the game is played on is a hexagon-style 1:4,000,000 scale map of Eastern Europe with each hex represents 72 kilometres (45 miles) from side to side.  Each turn represents approximately 10 days, with 3 turns per month. Units are generally corps of the Axis and armies for the Soviet Union, both about 60,000 troops each, while also consisting of smaller battle groups of specialist formations.<br/><br/>Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45 heart comes from it's novel and sophisticated integrated movement and combat system called CLIMACS, units conduct combat during the movement phase by expending movement points.  The game is played at Corps / Army scale. There isn't a combat phase in Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45.  All combat is done somewhat like overruns in the operations phase. A unit in range of a HQ  can roll for initiative to react when a combat is declared. Each HQ gets to do this once during the opponent's turn.<br/><br/>The air and naval aspect of the game is easy.  There are Armor effects in combat and rules to allow more than one stack at a time to combine their movement. When Armor effects are used the Tanks must take the first loss if any (you will see the way those Panzers get worn down in Barbarossa). Losses are by step with possible retreats and even morale rolls to hold your ground and take more losses instead of retreating.  There is also limited intelligence with many units off the map (Army / Front markers). You can only see the top unit in a stack.<br/><br/>Trial of Strength: War on the Eastern Front 1941-45 employs a special rule-set for the use of airborne, marine, mountain, artillery, rail-gun, rail construction NKVD and SS units.  The presence of an integrated political system into the game-play caters for historical events such as the reticence of Finland and the uprising of the Slovaks among others. While variable progress on the Western Front through the effects of Allied bombings and Partisans poses variable conditions for players.<br/><br/>",

You can choose to recruit and treat patients &mdash; gaining knowledge in one of four humors &mdash; publish works based on that knowledge, acquire herbs to aid your work, rejuvenate in the baths, or adopt a new philosophy. At the end of the year you compete in medical contests expending your focus and knowledge to gain reputation.

All players then reveal their chosen action at the same time.<br/><br/>Playing the best action at the right time won't be easy.

        "description": "The Battle of Rhode Island is volume 9 in GMT&rsquo;s Battles of the American Revolution series by designer Mark S. Miklos.  The map board depicts the northern half of the island including the fortified American positions around Butt's Hill. There are 64 America, British and Hessian combat units and leaders giving the game a counter density comparable to Saratoga in the series. Although the tactical situation is somewhat straightforward; Americans retreating and British pursuing primarily up two main roads, the nuanced play and game texture is like that found in all the games of the BoAR series.<br/><br/>To ensure replay-ability, each player has a unique deck of 26 Opportunity Cards that either enhance his side or diminish the enemy. Cards are drawn at-start and occasionally throughout play as governed by the turn track. There are also mechanisms for card draw tied to accumulated casualties or the possession of terrain objectives. Players may also spend Momentum to purchase additional cards.<br/><br/>The cards themselves may provide DRMs, adjustments to Army Morale, leader replacements, tactics advantages, step losses or step recovery, and additional units introduced into play among other outcomes. There is also the possibility of the game being extended one game turn into &quot;night&quot; wherein the British launch a surprise night attack. There are only a handful of Exclusive Rules to provide chrome including a squadron of British warships which may conduct off-shore bombardment. Players familiar with the core game system will be off and running in no time.<br/><br/>As a bonus, volume 9 will include a second scenario; The Battle of Newport.  This hypothetical scenario features a second map board depicting the southern half of the island, the city of Newport and the British defensive works that surrounded it as well as the American siege lines. The French army is presumed to have stayed on the island to cooperate in a direct assault upon the town. It will make for a fascinating &quot;what-if&quot; study of the first attempt at cooperation in the war by Franco-American forces.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Who will get the most support to claim the throne?<br/><br/>Five powerful houses decide the future of Japan, including the court of the Imperial Palace. Play skillfully to get the support of the clans that dominate the territories in these turbulent times.<br/><br/>Genpei stands out for its original mechanics where the players will chain actions to get them closer to victory by influencing more clans than their rival players. Easy to play but hard to master.<br/><br/>On your turn you must play one of the two cards from your hand. Whenever you play a clan card, it activates the clan marker on the corresponding clan wheel: move the marker to one of the two adjoining spaces and perform the action indicated on that space. You may perform a chain of actions during the same turn: whenever you draw a card as part of an action its clan marker is activated. Place your influence tokens to get the support of the Houses.<br/><br/>The player who receives the support of the most Houses (including the House of the Emperor) is declared the new Emperor and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the game of Dicke D&auml;monen, the players are magicians trying to rule the world. Curiously the world is smaller than you might think because in the eyes of a magician the world consists only of magical power lines and power fields, specifically four power lines: earth, fire, air and water. Wherever these lines enfold the space, the power fields are created; wherever the lines cross each other, the corners of these fields materialize. (In game terms, four colored strings &mdash; each tied to a ring &mdash; are placed on the table overlapping one another at the start of the game.) The magicians summon ghosts and demons to rule the world &mdash; but at the start of it all nobody knows which type of creature will be the strongest:<br/><br/>     Ghosts &ndash; white creatures &ndash; appear in the center of a power field, and wherever they are summoned, everything freezes in terror. Neither ghosts nor demons may appear in a power field once a ghost has been summoned there.<br/>     Demons &ndash; in the colors of the power lines &ndash; appear in the corners of the power fields adjacent to the lines of their color. No demon will enter a field where a ghost was summoned.<br/><br/><br/>Each magician summons again and again one of the four creatures at a place of his choice, thus filling the world with ghosts and demons. (Ghosts and demons are wooden pawns drawn from a cloth bag.) As soon as no more creature can be summoned, the fate of the world is decided &ndash; and one of the colors will be the strongest. Only once during the game can each magician predict a color, whether one of the demon colors or ghostly white, and each magician must predict a different color. (A player predicts a color by placing a pawn of the color in front of him.) This look into the future costs a lot of energy, and as soon as someone predicts a color, he will be harassed by fate and the other magicians. Thus, which color to predict is an important decision as well as when to predict it.<br/><br/>The magician who predicted the color which is the the strongest in the end rules the world.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Imperios Milenarios (Millenarian Empires) is a game where each player leads an ancient civilization of the World, expanding its territories, improving its sciences and boosting its industries throughout the Ages. The game will last until a number of civilizations reach the Bronze or Iron Ages, when points will be awarded for the territories and cities occupied, technologies discovered, trade goods obtained, Wonders built and treasure.<br/><br/>One distinctive element of the game is the use of a deck/pool-building mechanic mixed with role selection (similar to Eminent Domain) by which players draw a generic action of their choice to boost their hand every turn. This is done with little chips instead of cards, where chips in four different colors are each associated with a couple of possible actions. For instance, players can use blue chips in their hand (fleets/caravans) to expand to an adjacent maritime region, or, to trade goods and discoveries with other players.<br/><br/>As the game progresses and civilizations advance, the map will become gradually more and more crowded, players in turn will increase their hand sizes, and their chips will become more and more efficient by means of technological advancements, thus gradually increasing in complexity of negotiations and military tension. So the core of the interaction between players comes not much from direct conflict, but from the constant negotiation everyone is subject to, for the purpose of establishing accessible trading cities and beneficial exchanges, all the while procuring secured &ldquo;buffer zones&rdquo; between their Capitals.<br/><br/>",

Once the race starts, players use whips to urge their teams, or savage the other players or other players' teams.  A system also features driver fatigue, control checks and bodily damage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(Your Name Here) and the Argonauts is single player game of adventures and legends set in Grecian mythology. You will take on the role of a hero set out to recover treasure, slay monsters, and find a place for yourself in the retelling of Greek myths. The game is played with a set of (initially) 30 cards that represent the monsters, treasures, and gods will become the tale of your adventure. This deck, and your character, will change and grow as you play more games, which is meant to reflect how tales become more embellished and outlandish each time they are told.<br/><br/>Each turn you flip over the top three cards of the adventure deck. These cards represent monsters, treasures, and the favors of the gods. You must then allocate your crew members to each of the cards. After all of your crew have their tasks, you roll against each card. The more crew members you have on a card, the likelier you are to resolve it positively. Monsters are defeated and treasures are won. Fail the roll and treasures will be lost to you, and monsters will send your crew members to Hades. As you are among the crew, once they have all died you will also be on your way to meet Charon.<br/><br/>Once the deck has been exhausted, the adventure is complete and you have won! The game is not over however. After each successful retelling of your adventures, the story grows! Much like tales become taller every time they are told, the adventure deck will become more legendary each time you win.<br/><br/>All of the cards in the game will have check boxes on them that will be used to represent the level of the card. Cards that were defeated or captured after a successful adventure will be marked: monsters will become stronger and treasures will lose durability. Some monsters will even bring reinforcements into your deck.<br/><br/>Additionally, so that the player may keep up, the player can also level up after successful adventures. This allows the player to start games with a larger crew and add new items to the deck.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, you spawn new lice and jump over to nearby monkeys. Alternatively you can tickle the monkey, which makes it move and bump into other monkeys. That way more of your little friends can jump over! But beware of your rival families because nobody likes nit picking.

Divide players into three teams and give each team six question cards at random. Each question has a numerical answer from 0 to 100 on its reverse side, but you can never look at the back of a question card until after you play it!<br/><br/>For the first round, place the 50 number card in the center of play. Each team chooses a question card in front of them that they think will be as close to 50 as possible. Once each team has chosen, reveal the numbers on the back of the cards. Whichever team was farthest away from 50 draws a new question card from the deck &mdash; while the other teams discard their question cards &mdash; then the number on the back of the losing team's question card becomes the new target number for the next round. Each team has three power cards, and you can play a power card with your question card to raise or lower your number by 50; raise or lower it by 20; or allow you to discard an extra question card should your answer be within 5 of the target number.<br/><br/>The first team to have only question card in front of them wins! If multiple teams go down to one question card at the same time, they each must guess the answer on their own question card, and whichever team is closest wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kyoto takes players straight into one of the burning issues of our time: climate change &mdash; and not with a wagging finger, but by putting them into the shoes of the decision makers.<br/><br/>As delegates from different countries, players face a few quick rounds of negotiation at a climate conference. Together, they try to hit reduction targets and provide the needed funding, knowing that each round they fail to do so they inflict severe damage on the planet. But bent on preserving their own country's wealth and following their secret agendas, none of them may be eager to give more than absolutely necessary. After all, the winner will be whoever best preserves their wealth...unless the impending damage to earth becomes too severe, in which case the conference fails immediately and the greediest player can't win.<br/><br/>",

Each player competes against all the other players to win.  A Hobbit player wins if he can get the one ring to the Cracks of Doom and survive for one turn.  A Black Rider player wins if he can get the ring to Barad-Dur and survive for one turn.<br/><br/>There is a map of Middle Earth but this is a card driven game.  The map generally hinders movement and supplies places to draw cards.  Cards can be tools to help you fight or move through types of terrain at a reduced cost.<br/><br/>A players turn consists of moving, having Friendly Exchanges, executing Power Plays, and drawing cards.  Power Plays include looking at other player&rsquo;s hands, taking cards from another player, and/or executing a battle against another player.<br/><br/>Though game play is simple and fast, strategies and subtleties of play are not always obvious and requires intelligent play through good timing in movement, using cards effectively, and especially having Friendly Exchanges and Power Plays in combinations to achieve maximum advantage.<br/><br/>Optional rules include playing as partners (Hobbits vs. Black Riders) and the enhanced two-player game where one player controls all four Hobbits and the other player controls all four Black Riders.<br/><br/>",

The entire world, including the watching Germans, expected the war to end in a crushing Soviet victory in a manner or weeks, if not days.  But the Finns resisted bitterly and managed, by dint of incredible courage and masterful improvisation, to inflict a string of humiliating defeats on the invaders.  Instead of a Soviet victory march, the Soviet Union found itself unexpectedly involved in a serious struggle with implications for its future survival.  That struggle has gone down in history as the Winter War.<br/><br/>Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: 1 week<br/>    Hex: 15 miles / 24 kilometers<br/>    Units: Regiment to Division<br/><br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>    One countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 24-page rulebook<br/>    Two dual-side Player Aid Cards<br/>    Two 10-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-5 hours<br/><br/>(description based on back of the box)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "All is lost save Honour is a game about the campaigns fought during the Italian Wars (1494-1530), mainly between the Hapsburgs (the Empire) and the Valois (the French kingdom). The first volume is devoted to campaigns between Agnadello (1509) and Pavia (1525)<br/><br/>All began after reading Taylor&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Art of War in Italy 1494-1529&rdquo;, London, 1920. Soon that period looked extremely interesting to us and nearly neglected by the wargame community.<br/>Our intent was to generate any interest, among &ldquo;aficionados&rdquo; and historians, about that ancient era, when the first applications of modern strategy in the art of war took place.<br/><br/>This is the time of charges of cavalrymen with the finest gliding armors; of the first use of fire arms and artillery (with some effect); sieges, mercenary troops, treachery, pillaging and all that &ldquo;chrome&rdquo; that may enlighten a wargame.<br/><br/>Those campaigns were led to bring to &ldquo;the battle&rdquo;, which was often decisive, we decided to bring in a detailed sequence of the main battle (said &ldquo;Major Battle&rdquo;). So in the game, there are three kinds of battle: Major Battle, Skirmish and Siege with the Major Battle involving different tactics played by each side.<br/><br/>The map represents Lombardy in the XVIth century and the neighbors states. The sources for the maps were new books and old manuscripts and maps, among which a manuscript dated 1520 (!), regarding the state of the roads in the area between Lodi and Piacenza.<br/>Many books have been written about this subject and I think we have read the most important ones.<br/><br/>We had to make a selection of all those campaigns fought in Italy during the Italian Wars. The five campaigns we have included are:<br/>- Agnadello 1509, Venice defends its Republic against the foes. <br/>- Novara 1513, the Swiss against the French army. The last triumph of the Swiss.<br/>- Marignano 1515, Fran&ccedil;ois I grabs the Duchy of Milan from the Swiss<br/>- Bicocca 1522, the French lose the Duchy of Milan<br/>- Pavia 1525, Fran&ccedil;ois I loses the largest battle and Milan to the Empire<br/><br/>Game Highlights:<br/><br/>     new game system, operational-level, devoted to warfare in the XVIth century campaigns<br/>     highly interactive sequence of play, focused on maneuver and careful planning<br/>     various forms of combat: Major Battles, Skirmishes, Sieges<br/>     set of Exclusive Rules and specific rules and events for each campaign<br/>     a 22&quot; x 34&quot; fine-art map , reproducing a part of XVIth northern Italy, based on an accurate study of ancient maps and sources<br/>     gorgeous iconic counters representing all the main Capitani who fought there and the different combat units<br/>     detailed (as it is possible) order of battle, with combat units differentiated by strength, maximum movement, quality and reliability<br/>     very low counter density and limited play time<br/><br/><br/>(from Europa Simulazioni website)<br/><br/>",

You quickly set up perimeter force fields and begin surveying the surrounding terrain for debris from your ship, only to find it scattered everywhere. Then you see them &ndash; at first only a few &quot;bug&quot; scouts, but then the numbers begin to increase all around you: archers, slashers, and even the monstrous brutes. This is more than a scouting party; this is a war party! They begin to attack the shields as the crew starts to retrieve debris. The SOS has been sent and a ship in the sector has responded, but can it get to you before the &quot;bugs&quot; overwhelm your crew? Can you repair parts of the ship and use it as a defense? Can you repair the hull and fire up the engine to lift off? It's all in the hands of the crew &ndash; your hands.<br/><br/>In Alien Uprising, the player crew must either hold off the Zothren attacks until the rescue ship arrives, or repair the ship and lift off from the hostile planet before being destroyed. To achieve either of these goals, the crew must work together, using their unique skills and chosen actions to perform a number of tasks, defend themselves, and retrieve and repair equipment and the ship.<br/><br/>To establish the actions available each turn, the first player rolls custom dice, then each player chooses an action for the turn, starting with the first player. The available actions include combat, engineering, reload/recharge first aid, scout, and wild; the dice also have an alien icon that shows the speed of the enemy while limiting the actions that players have available to them. Players also have unique character skills, and the game can be set to higher levels of difficulty for more experienced players.<br/><br/>",

Gameplay takes place on a 6x6 board.  To set up, you each spread your 18 pieces at random on your half of the board. The black player begins.<br/><br/>On a turn, choose a piece or a stack of more than one piece that you control--you control a piece/stack if your color is on top--then move that piece/stack so that it lands on something of the same type, i.e., a single piece needs to land on a single piece and a stack on a stack. You move the piece/stack orthogonally 1-3 steps to occupied fields, with the number of steps matching the number of marks on the topmost piece. You can move the piece/stack at a 90&ordm; angle with each step (at an occupied field), so a piece/stack that moves 2 steps can go straight to the second occupied field or it can make a single 90&ordm; turn as it passes over the first occupied field.<br/><br/>As more spaces become empty, fewer movement options remain open to players, and as soon as any one player cannot move, the game ends. Each player then scores for the pieces and stacks they control. The value of a piece/stack is the number of marks on the topmost piece multiplied by the number of pieces in that stack, which means a piece on its own is worth only 1-3 points. Whoever has the higher score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the XII century, during the territory reconquest, small kingdoms are formed in the Iberian Peninsula, which will continue to fight among themselves in the following centuries. In the West, bordering the Atlantic Ocean, a new country is born &ndash; Portugal. The first Portuguese kings strongly invest their efforts and scarce resources in the expansion of the territory towards South, while organizing the defense of these new borders. Castles are built and land-use contracts are given to small villages that grow bigger and gain more importance in these parts of the country.<br/><br/>Where today exists in the County of Idanha-a-Nova a line with six castles which was formed to help in the defence of the Country and maintain distance from the kingdom of Leon. This line of Castles enabled the growth of a region that since the time of the Roman presence had an enormous importance in the interior of the peninsula.<br/><br/>In 6 Castelos, 2 to 4 players are representatives of the king seeking to promote agriculture, free trade, religious faith and wealth for the nobles of the kingdom.<br/><br/>Note: Solo rules are available online but do not come in the game box.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Love is...green? In the vivid storytelling game Farben, every color tells a story. Associate a color with a word, then tell a story of why you connect those two. If the word were &quot;school&quot;, for example, you might hear the following:<br/><br/><br/>    Player 1 plays purple: &quot;I dyed my hair purple, purchased leather gear for several hundred dollars, and wore make-up in my very short Goth-phase. I quickly realized that I didn't fit in the scene as I am a rather happy person and have a hard time not constantly smiling.&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Player 2 plays red: 'My high school time was stressful because I wasn't a good student. I worried before each exam how I was going to explain all the mistakes marked with red to my parents.&quot;<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Player 3 plays black: 'I was totally in love with a fellow student from another class. I got up every day at 6:30 a.m. to catch the early bus to ride with her to school. It was still dark at that time, and that's why I chose black.&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Each round, you associate one of your twelve color cards with a word card and start telling a story. After all stories have been told, players tuck their color cards below the word card and set it aside. After ten words have been played, the scoring phase begins. Another player selects one of the visible words for you, and your task is to recall all of the colors played by the other players and yourself without looking. You earn points for correctly naming these colors. This sounds almost impossible at first, but through the stories the colors become easier to remember. Additionally, you score points on the other players' turns when they can remember your color.<br/><br/>You win the game if you can remember best who assigned which color to specific words and if multiple players can remember the colors you assigned to the words.<br/><br/>",

Monster defense is difficult because you must find protective objects and the right weapon isn't always available. You'll need to find defense somehow, though, as you don't have enough seals to last the entire night...<br/><br/>In Verflucht! (Cursed!), players work cooperatively to battle monsters drawn from a central pile of cards, trying to achieve the best score possible.<br/><br/>The deck consists of red cards with creatures on them and green cards with items valued from 1 to 40. These cards are mixed face down on the table, while a set of seal cards are placed in a stack. On a turn, the active player draws a card from the center of the table and looks at it. If it shows an item, they take the card on the hand without revealing its value. If the drawn card is a creature, they must place the card face up in the display. The player now has the chance to expel one of the red creatures with one (or more) green cards, and the collective value ​​of the items played must be at least as high as the value of the creature. Players need to somehow decide among themselves who should drive away which creature or else valuable items will be spent fruitlessly!<br/><br/>The creatures don't lie dormant on display. When the sixth creature is placed in the display, the most powerful creature present attack; the same thing happens when creatures form a group (i.e., when their values are in a numerical order). The players must expel these monsters immediately, and if they can't, they must use a seal to expel all the monsters; when this happens, the monsters are re-shuffled with the remaining face-down cards. When all face-down cards have been drawn and all attacks successfully defeated, the players win. To determine their score, place all unused seals on the remaining creatures in the display. The collective value of the remaining creatures equals the players' score. How low can you go?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mont&eacute;limar: Anvil of Fate, On August 15, 1944, the Allies invaded the South of France in Operation Dragoon. Major General Truscott's U.S. VI Corps landed along a 45 mile stretch of French Coast with the objective of isolating the major German forces defending the western part of France and linking up with the Normandy forces breaking out of their beachhead. The southern beachhead would be secured in only 2 days and the Americans were well established inland. With scattered and only occasionally strong resistance, the Americans and now landed French advanced north up the Rhone valley along highway N-7 &mdash; heading quickly toward the key rail and road junction at Aix-en-Provence. This was captured on August 19th. At this point, General Truscott activated a provisional force called Task Force Butler. This roughly regimentally sized unit raced ahead of the main force with the objective of capturing the main route of escape for the German Army. The Task Force set up a defensive position in the high ground to the north of Mont&eacute;limar. They were to hold until relieved.

One point for the Blue Team!&quot;<br/><br/>In the communication game Word Slam, two teams compete against one another simultaneously. In each round, one player on each team tries to get their teammates to guess a hidden word or phrase using only the 105 explanatory cards available in the box. Speaking and acting is forbidden! They must tell their stories using only 105 cards, each with one word on it: a noun, verb, adjective, or preposition. A player can use as many explanatory cards as desired, and whichever team guesses correctly first scores a point. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>Word Slam Midnight features the same gameplay as the original Word Slam in a compact format. This version includes 210 story word cards and 100 answer cards, with a total of 600 answer terms in four difficulty levels, .<br/><br/>In this version, the die and timer is replaced by an app. Instead of using card holders, the two box halves are used as screens between the teams, and the answer cards are played behind the screens. Word Slam Midnight can be played as both an expansion to the base game and a standalone game.<br/><br/>",

Now players must base their air assets and ships (down to the cruiser level) on the map and move them to respond to threats. Air-naval combat, commerce raiding, anti-submarine warfare, and naval construction are all accounted for while preserving that Krieg design elegance you know and love.<br/><br/>Finally, there&rsquo;s Dice of Decision II, a much-expanded update to the Random Campaign Generator featured in Totaler Krieg! As before, you&rsquo;ll be able to create new, very different Second World Wars based on alt-history paths from the Great War and the 1920s and &lsquo;30s. What if the Tsar still ruled Russia? What if Germany had won the war in 1917? What if there hadn&rsquo;t been a Great Depression? New for DoD II is everything related to Asia and the Pacific &mdash; now you&rsquo;ll be able to explore what might have happened if there were no Washington Naval Treaty? What if Japan&rsquo;s 1931 involvement in Manchuria had unfolded differently? What if Gandhi had gained independence for India? Naturally, your alt-hist Europe and Pacific games will still link to tell a completely original Global War story.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1692. In an atmosphere of pessimism and charged paranoia, the citizens of Salem are at the mercy of demons &ndash; not demons of the soul, but demons of the mind. What began as a devout Puritan community devolved in a matter of months into a people torn apart by fear, lies, and fanatical orthodoxy. The residents of Salem quickly discovered that they could find Hell all around them.<br/><br/>Salem incites the atmosphere of paranoia that held the village of Salem captive. Players act with the assumption that there are witches among them (and, in this case, there will be). Each player controls six residents of Salem, three of whom are witches. Game play is simple: try to rid the village of witches and keep the identities of your own residents secret.<br/><br/>The game plays over the course of four rounds representing the four months (June&ndash;September 1692) in which the hysteria was at its height. Each round has two parts: a Witch Hunt and a Witch Trial, followed by hangings (the dates of which correspond to the four actual hangings that took place in Salem that year). During the Witch Hunt, players send residents to jail and provide alibis for their own jailed citizens. At the end of each round all jailed citizens stand trial. Players then collectively decide who is hanged and who is spared. The player who is most successful at discerning witches from villagers wins!<br/><br/>While the story surrounding the Salem witch trials has become something of a legend, every character in this game is based on a real person whose life was directly touched and in some cases torn apart or taken away by the events surrounding the Salem witch trials. Extensive research has been done to craft the real-life stories of all 42 residents in the game.<br/><br/>While this game focuses on the people and events specific to Salem, Massachusetts, similar witch hunts were taking place as far north as Maine and as far West as Connecticut. Surely, the devil had come to New England.<br/><br/>",

From time to time, when Caesar is especially impressed by your development, he may provide you with extra support.<br/><br/>Palmyra is a tactical tile-laying game with few rules and high tactical choices. By placing new land tiles and moving your army and censor, you earn new tiles and coins for the Roman Empire. The most important thing is to not be too greedy when collecting taxes; otherwise future income may become sparse. Additionally, don't let tiles placed by your opponents cut you off, or else you'll be forced to lose valuable time. When all of the 120 coins are collected, the game ends, and whoever has collected the most coins wins.<br/><br/>",

You will gather resources &amp; food, fight deadly predators, and learn the mysteries of fire. Your task is a difficult one, but no matter what happens, remember: you and the fire must survive...<br/><br/>Your tribe consists of 4 characters, all taking turns to search for resources, fight off dangerous animals, unlock new discoveries, and working together to keep the fire alive!<br/><br/>Designed from the ground up to offer a re-playable, interactive, strategic cooperative experience for 1-4 players.

        "description": "Excerpted from a review by Ken Tidwell<br/><br/>Aerodrome is a miniatures game of aerial combat during World War I. Players take on the role of biplane pilots and tail gunners dog fighting their way through the gray skies of Europe during the war to end all wars. The game is visually appealing and, like many miniatures games, it was easy to project myself into the scenario. The game is played using 1/72 miniature aircraft mounted on radio antennae with a clear acrylic hex base to hold the whole thing upright. The game board is an aerial view of a WWI battlefield marked off in large hexes.<br/><br/>Pilots and gunners plot out three moves at a time. Each move the pilot chooses from one of eight maneuvers - straight ahead, straight ahead fast, left slip, right slip, right, left, hard right, stall, and Immelman. The slips allow the player to retain their current orientation but slide one hex to the right or left. Ahead fast allows the plane to move two hexes. Ahead, left, right, and hard right allow the plane to change orientation and move one hex in that new direction. An Immelman allows the plane to move forward one hex but completely reverse orientation. A stall allows the plane to stay in its current hex with the current orientation but runs the risk of throwing the plane into a spin. Planes can fly on one of five altitudes. Descent is always possible but planes can generally only ascend when moving forward and trying no wild acrobatics. After movement, pilots may fire on any plane unlucky enough to find itself in their path.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is about the struggle for power and influence in cities by the competing guilds of the age. Players represent one city colour &amp; have a set of tiles in 3 shapes in your colour and a set of cards for each city plus 4 action cards. You play a card and place a tile either from your set or from the church or neutral sets. The starting player also first draws a card from a central deck which effectively gives them an extra move. Tiles of the same colour cannot touch and the church tiles allow cities to expand.<br/><br/>When a city is completed, it is scored. The colour with the most tiles gets the 1st score, the second colour gets half that, the next gets 4 points and the fourth colour gets 2 pts. Therefore it is possible for the neutral colour to score more points than players. The score is a total of the tiles in the city, plus one for each church, plus one for each cathedral place.<br/><br/>The action cards let you pick up your discards, place a tile to be fixed later, and go first twice (which are discarded). The draw deck cards can be held to score extra points at the end.<br/><br/>At first the game seems pedestrian, but within a few turns the possibilities become more obvious. Judicious use of the pick-up and turn order cards make a big difference. Not spreading too widely and using the neutral tiles to devalue other cities also matters.<br/><br/>An interesting placement game that the designer Wolfgang Panning took 2 1/2 years to complete. The choice of Flanders mattered to him because the theme is of city guilds, such as Weavers, who fought to control the cities.<br/><br/>",

But you will have to be very careful, someone is not pleased by your presence...<br/><br/>Michael is a cooperative game with a strong narrative component.

We all praise our own gods and Mother Goddess for being good to us. This new era has brought something new to us: The area is progressively filling with dwellings, built tight against each other. New generations are building their houses over the remains of old constructions.

Who knows, when the children of our children will come to the world, which clan will rule this multitude?<br/><br/>In Hoyuk, each player represents a clan that settles with other clans to erect a village. During the game, a replica of a Neolithic settlement will be built on the H&ouml;y&uuml;k board using tiles that represent houses. Many additional pieces &mdash; such as ovens, shrines, and pens &mdash; will also aid a player in building his settlements. (&quot;Hoyuk&quot; is Turkish for hill or mound. The word is also used for prehistoric settlements in the region that have a characteristic, hill-like look from houses being built on top of older houses and the absence of streets between the houses because people entered their homes through the roof.)<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to build the best settlement and score the most victory points, with multiple paths to victory and many choices along the way.

On each player's board, a rotating wheel indicates where and when actions can take place, and another central wheel that affects all players indicates what yields they can expect.

        "description": "D&iacute;as de Radio is a storytelling cooperative card game in real time for 2 to 4 players. The players choose one subgenre from a series of twelve, then tell a story using phrases in the cards. The storyteller sets aside their hand during their narration, using only cards given by the other players until time runs out. The storyteller position then rotates in clockwise order, and the next player begins their turn, continuing the story.<br/><br/>Each turn brings the game closer to conclusion. When the endgame is triggered, the current storyteller must close the tale. Players have the option of using the &quot;Press Review System&quot;, which consists of four different tableaus featuring unique words: Creative, Bizarre, Engaging, Poetic. As each narrator finishes their turn, the rest of the players draw a cube from a common pool and place it on one of the four tableaus. Thus, at game's end, the tableau that has the most cubes determines the press reaction to the show (the story). On the back of each of them, there are fictional newspaper articles praising the players.<br/><br/>The game is in Spanish, full languague dependence, and it has an icon system for the color blind.<br/><br/>Each game takes 14 to 24 minutes.<br/><br/>",

Scrimmage games are the quickest, using identical rookie teams and a subset of the rules to help you learn how to play the game. Exhibition games add skills, edges, and unique pro teams to give you many more options. League games add support staff and let you improve your team over a full season of games.<br/><br/>The game includes rules for risk-based scoring, penalties, injuries, mascots, cheerleaders, physicians, assistant coaches, mavericks, 50 player skills (like Savagery and Immaculate Reception), 70 strategy cards (like Epic Fail and No Time to Bleed), and more. All of this adds up to enough strategic options to fuel hours and hours of thrilling victories and agonizing defeats.<br/><br/>",

It should be short work to cast out the doubts, rebuild the temples, and awaken some of your old allies. Only a few faithful acolytes remain, but they will suffice.<br/><br/>After all, you are not some feeble mortal, and who could defy the will of a God?<br/><br/><br/>In Theurgy, you and up to five others take on the role of half-forgotten gods and compete to have temples built in your honour. A player wins if, at their end of their turn, they have met one of three winning conditions:<br/><br/>Become the Official Faith: Build X temples, including one in the Capital.<br/>Fulfil Your Calling: Build X+1 temples and meet your secret objective.<br/>Spread Across the Land: Build X+2 temples anywhere on the board.<br/><br/>The exact number of temples you need to build for the winning conditions varies with the player count.<br/><br/>In many ways, Theurgy is a classic area control strategy game in which you must carve out your territory and undermine the territory belonging to your rivals. However, to achieve this, players must also manage and draft cards wisely. By performing incredible miracles, unleashing epic combinations of monsters, and cleverly utilising their deity&rsquo;s unique power, players can find ingenious ways to give themselves a surprising edge.<br/><br/>A turn consists of choosing one of the following four actions:<br/><br/>Pilgrimage: move acolytes and followers from settlement to settlement. Along the way, your acolytes can preach to convert the resident population or fight off monsters to protect your following from the ill will of your rivals.<br/><br/>Spread the Word: place (or replace) a faith token to mark your growing cultural influence in the surrounding settlements. It will be far easier to construct temples if your religion is already deeply rooted in the region's culture.<br/><br/>Divine Intervention: perform a miracle by playing a card from your hand or choose a monster to summon from the cards available in the central area. A player may also activate the abilities of monsters they have already summoned, so that the larger a player&rsquo;s horde, the more powerful their interventions become.<br/><br/>Test the Faith:&nbsp;trigger an anomalous event in a settlement of your choice to see which god the locals turn to when their faith is tested. The distribution of followers in a settlement, each deity&rsquo;s cultural influence, and the level of scepticism present there all play a role in determining which religion's temple will be constructed &ndash; and which torn down&hellip;<br/><br/>The most successful deities are those best able to time their interventions and use their turns to sneak their influence under the radar and establish followings in the most unlikely of places.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After movement your opponent may react but with only a few units, making player decisions difficult; do I go to the aid of a unit likely to be attacked or use my reaction to push troops forward in an area where I am on the offensive. After combat there is exploitation movement. Only motorized infantry, tanks and cavalry may exploit and are scarce in this campaign. In addition there is a very nice chit pull system to give both sides some special abilities and keep the enemy guessing as to what comes next. Finally some Italian native units may decide to join the Allies, or they may stay loyal, which creates extra tension in the game.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: 7.5 miles / 12.5 kilometers<br/>Units: Company to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 11 x 17&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (140 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page Road to Cheren rulebook<br/>One dual-side printed cover sheet/player aid card<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-4 hours<br/><br/>Note: Players will need to provide one 6-sided die for game play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a departure from the usual style of 18xx game, which relies on no more luck than where you sit in the starting order. In 1829 Mainline, you are dealt a collection of share certificates from which you select your initial portfolio. Further shares become available during the stock rounds. Players may bring additional certificates out from their initial deal, buy shares from the pool, or take a certificate from the draw pile, buying the share certificate they draw or placing it on the discard pile. If you have enough money, you can buy your way down through the discard pile to get what you really want.<br/><br/>Each player tends to operate one or more companies from the start of the game, but it is easier to lose control if someone else gets the right certificates from the draw or discard piles. With no phases as such, tiles may be promoted from yellow to green to russet and grey at any time, as long as the usual sequence is observed.<br/><br/>With less control over the shares you gain, the challenge is more to do with making the best of what you have been dealt rather than trying to follow your grand design.<br/><br/>",

As the game begins, mankind has spent millennia enduring a vicious cycle of destruction and triumph. It has led to millions of settlers being severed from civilization and<br/>stranded in a galaxy, far away from planet Earth. Its history now faded in the mists of time. In this new world, five distinct human races have emerged as the primary contestants for power. They are the Amarr, Minmatar, Gallente, Caldari - all of which are playable in this Core Set - and the mysterious Jovians.<br/><br/>Each race relies on the success of progressive corporations to increase the overall influence in the galaxy. A corporation&rsquo;s innate zest for building wealth and prestige, in addition to its intense focus on reaching goals, make the corporation the most effective tool in the struggle for power. Some would even say they are the most effective means of governing the masses as well...<br/><br/>The Game Concept<br/><br/>You must produce a steady income by claiming the outer regions of space and harvesting their rich resources. Enhance your star base and defend it from incoming threats. Build a fleet of spaceships and send them on missions to reduce your opponents&rsquo; income, steal their resources, and ultimately destroy their star bases.<br/><br/>Victory Conditions<br/><br/>If all your opponents&rsquo; star bases have been destroyed, or you have met an alternative victory condition, you win the game. If you are to draw a card when none are left in your deck, you lose the game.<br/><br/>",

Declare what you are doing, which card you are playing, and which zombie you are attacking, and roll dice. This simulates the chaos of combat. Most cards can be used to perform more than one function. You can perform as many actions during the Survivor Turn as your cards can support. You can even trade weapons and items with other Survivors in your Location.<br/><br/>Once all players have resolved their actions, the Zombies get to attack.<br/><br/>The game is co-opish... how you play the game is up to you.

        "description": "Materia Prima places players in a medieval world where mysticism and science are inseparable in alchemy. In search of the philosopher's stone, recipes must be researched and resources mined. The competitive sandbox game combines various mechanics, such as dice rolling while fighting, deck building while recipe exploration, grid movement on a modular game board, pick up and delivery while resource mining, resource management while crafting items and area control by creating little helpers, the Homunculi.<br/><br/>Materia Prima is a highly immersive game about alchemy and how to create the Philosopher's Stone. Each alchemist must look for long lost recipes and research in old libraries of the cities to create the stone. The elements for this must be mined on hexes, which are distributed on the game board. Alchemy has a centuries-old tradition and its masters come from families, schools and guilds whose history is as old as the records that tell of them. An Alchemist is therefore not a blank sheet of paper. Some have a special alchemical codex, others act out of love or revenge, and there are those who have gone mad by the power of the Philosopher&lsquo;s Stone and want to plunge the world into chaos. Every single biography results in a secret quest. However, this secret should be guarded, since the competitors will exploit every weakness. The game can only be completed when the first one with the help of the Philosopher&lsquo;s Stone fulfills this quest.<br/><br/>The two central game mechanics are a turn and action based move system and a resource based crafting system.<br/><br/>     The alchemists have a certain number of possible actions (moving, fighting, dismantling, buying, transmuting, etc.) on each turn, depending on the hexes they are currently in. Both the possibilities of action and the number of actions increase in the course of the game, depending on which equipment or homunculi an alchemist transmutes. This immediately leads to the second game mechanic, the crafting system.<br/>     Not only the Philosopher's Stone, but also equipment and homunculi are transmuted with a crafting system. The required elements can be mined on the game board and then improved or transmuted. Meet the enemies heavily armed with sword and shield! Be the wisest and defeat your enemies with the power of alchemy! Be cunning and lead your opponents on the wrong track! Be a strategist and lead your helpers into battle. With the crafting system you turn the game into your game. <br/><br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>Video-link for the assemble of the card-board-tray:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.materiaprimaboardgame.com/.cm4all/uproc.php/0/.VID_20190519_155022.mp4/video.mp4?_=16af45436e9\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.materiaprimaboardgame.com/.cm4all/uproc.php/0/.VI...</a><br/><br/>",

Queen Victoria has enlisted the aid of exceptional individuals to investigate the impending plot and save her realm from its calamitous consequences.<br/><br/>Victoriana is a cooperative game for 1-4 players. Players move throughout London marshaling and managing resources, investigating leads, and thwarting the agents of an unknown mastermind before time runs out.<br/><br/>Players take the role of investigators that have influence within different realms of British society (politics, science, occult, and the underworld). The conspiracy's three elements (mastermind, plot, and locale) are represented by cards and tokens selected in secret before the game begins. Leads relating to the conspiracy are represented by facedown cards tied to notable London locations. Players move their figures throughout the city, revealing lead cards, expending their investigator's influence tokens to acquire those leads, and deciding how to apply them toward the conspiracy's hidden aspects.<br/><br/>Time is not on their side. Mismanaging the clock or their influence tokens causes leads to go cold, traumatizing investigators and bringing the conspiracy closer to its dreadful realization. Worse, as the investigators come closer to the truth, the mastermind dispatches agents to stymie their movements, disrupt their efforts (by forcing them to discard influence tokens), and assassinate them (by causing trauma).<br/><br/>Identifying the elements of the conspiracy leads the players to a climactic confrontation. If the precise combination of influence is accrued and the investigators assemble at the correct locale, the queen is saved and the British Empire preserved; however, if too many leads go cold, Big Ben strikes midnight, or the investigators are too traumatized, a dire fate awaits.<br/><br/>",

Negotiate, threaten, and ally with rival gangs when it serves your needs, but be wary of the inevitable knife in the back...<br/><br/>Over six rounds, players take turns driving to locations in the city represented by the grid of cards at the center of the board. Different locations provide access to materials, cash, or clout that the player's gang members can &quot;acquire&quot; through trade, earning profit from property within their territory or by exploiting parts of the city under the control of a rival gang. All players must maintain a certain discretion as selling too much in one round will draw unwanted attention or else saturate the city in liquor &mdash; and your fellow mafioso won't be too happy about lost profits.<br/><br/>The gang with the most cash at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Frauen&quot; contains historical events related to women. It can be played as a standalone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

The Prohibitionists fielded Eugene Chaffin running only seven years prior to the passing of the 18th Amendment (prohibition). This resulted in a five-way race in which the Democrats actually won and the third party, the Progressives came in second.<br/><br/>The election is represented by a straightforward, card driven, geographically based game where the winners of each state are decided by lot.

Nine Estate cards are your targets to build: City Walls, a Cathedral, a Castle, and more.  The other 9 cards make up the Structures deck which contains resources plus structures to be built.

The goal is to have the most points in your movie when &quot;Roll the Credits&quot; is played or the draw deck runs out.<br/><br/>To explain the subtitle: &quot;Skippy the Wonderdog&quot; is a fan favorite character from the B-Movie Series and appears as a creature instead of a character in this game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(Version fran&ccedil;aise ci-dessous.)<br/><br/>In 1944, during the night of 5th to 6th June, paratroopers of the British 6th Airborne achieved three heroic missions that made possible the D-Day Normandy Landings on the East sector (Gold, Juno and Sword beaches). <br/>In Operation Commando - Pegasus Bridge, one player leads the English commandos, while his opponent is in charge of the defending German troops.<br/><br/>Each turn, on a different battlefield (each ground having specific characteristics), players draw cards (each player has his own deck), can play events, and then an assault begins. The German plays a unit; the English answers with a unit, that must have a Combat value equal or higher than the German unit's, or reach it thanks to boosts. If it does, the German can boost his unit, then the English, and so on until a player stops. A unit's combat value can be raised by combat action cards and tokens (one side +1 Combat, one blank side) taken from the player's tokens reserve and flipped.<br/>If the English's unit is destroyed, he loses one of his 3 Manpower Points (MP) but moves to the next ground (the assault ends, as does the turn on this ground). If the German's unit is destroyed, he can play another one (depending on the ground's size) and the assault goes on. If the English destroys all enemy units present on the ground, he wins the assault and progresses without losing a MP.<br/><br/>Players also have a pool of special cards, the powerful &quot;heroic&quot; cards, from which they secretely choose one card to add to their hand each two turns. Since heroic cards have potent effects and can't be countered, choosing them well depending on the situation of the game is strategically very important. These cards feature actual historical officers and events.<br/><br/>The game contains three scenarios, each of which corresponding to one of the three missions that the English commandos had to fulfill this night: the taking of the bridge of B&eacute;nouville (&quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot;) to allow the landed troops to progress deeper inside the land; the assault on the Merville Gun Battery, a fortified area threatening the Landind beaches with long distance cannons; and the bombing of the bridges on the Dives river to prevent the tanks of the 21th Panzer Division from reinforcing the German troops. Each scenario has its own pool of cards (including heroic cards) and different gameplays.<br/><br/>To win, the English must fulfill his objective (which depends of the scenario), by winning the assault on one or more objective grounds. To win, the German has to prevent the English to reach his goal, generally by bringing his Manpower Points to zero or, in the Dives scenario, by preventing him to destroy two bridges out of four.<br/><br/>The three scenarios can be played in campaign mode (one after the other) to recreate the historic night. Depending on his results, the English gets more or less campaign points, and when the three scenarios have been played, his total score indicates if the D-Day Landing will be possible or not.<br/><br/>The 120 artworks illustrating the cards are realistic and faithful to historical documents (uniforms, weapons, locations...)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>En 1944, pendant la nuit du 5 au 6 juin, les parachutistes de la 6e Division A&eacute;roport&eacute;e Britannique (&quot;6th Airborne&quot;) accomplirent trois missions h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques qui permirent au D&eacute;barquement d'avoir lieu sur le secteur est (plages Gold, Juno et Sword).<br/>Dans **Op&eacute;ration Commando - Pegasus Bridge**, l'un des joueurs dirige les commandos anglais, et son adversaire les troupes allemandes.<br/><br/>&Agrave; chaque tour, sur un champ de bataille diff&eacute;rent (chaque terrain poss&eacute;dant des caract&eacute;ristiques sp&eacute;cifiques), les joueurs piochent des cartes (chacun a sa propre pioche), peuvent jouer des &eacute;v&eacute;nements, puis un assaut commence. L'Allemand joue une unit&eacute; ; l'Anglais r&eacute;pond par une unit&eacute;, qui doit avoir une valeur de combat &eacute;gale ou sup&eacute;rieure &agrave; celle de l'unit&eacute; allemande, ou l'atteindre gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des bonus. Si c'est le cas, l'Allemand peut renforcer son unit&eacute;, puis l'Anglais peut faire de m&ecirc;me, et ainsi de suite jusqu'&agrave; ce qu'un joueur renonce. La valeur de combat d'une unit&eacute; peut &ecirc;tre augment&eacute;e gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des actions de combat et des jetons (avec une face +1 et une face sans bonus) pris dans la r&eacute;serve du joueur et jet&eacute;s en l'air comme un pile ou face.<br/>Si l'unit&eacute; de l'Anglais est d&eacute;truite, il perd l'un de ses 3 Points d'Effectifs (PE) mais avance jusqu'au prochain terrain (l'assaut se termine, de m&ecirc;me que le tour sur ce terrain). Si c'est l'unit&eacute; de l'Allemand qui est d&eacute;truite, ce dernier peut en jouer une autre (selon la taille du terrain) et l'assaut se poursuit. Si l'Anglais &eacute;limine toutes les unit&eacute;s ennemies pr&eacute;sentes, il remporte l'assaut et progresse sans perdre de PE.<br/><br/>Les joueurs disposent &eacute;galement d'une r&eacute;serve de cartes sp&eacute;ciales, les puissantes cartes &quot;h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques&quot;, r&eacute;serve dans laquelle ils choisissent secr&egrave;tement une carte qu'ils ajoutent &agrave; leur main tous les deux tours. Les cartes h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques ayant des effets puissants et ne pouvant &ecirc;tre annul&eacute;es, bien les choisir en fonction du d&eacute;roulement de la partie est strat&eacute;giquement tr&egrave;s important. Ces cartes repr&eacute;sentent des officiers ayant r&eacute;ellement pris part aux op&eacute;rations et des &eacute;v&eacute;nements s'&eacute;tant effectivement produits.<br/><br/>Le jeu propose trois sc&eacute;narios, chacun d'eux correspondant &agrave; l'une des trois missions que les commandos anglais devaient accomplir cette nuit-l&agrave; : la prise du pont de B&eacute;nouville (&quot;Pegasus Bridge&quot;) pour permettre aux troupes d&eacute;barqu&eacute;es de progresser &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur des terres ; l'assaut sur la batterie de Merville, une zone fortifi&eacute;e mena&ccedil;ant les plages du D&eacute;barquement avec des canons &agrave; longue port&eacute;e ; et la destruction des ponts sur la rivi&egrave;re Dives pour emp&ecirc;cher les blind&eacute;s de la 21e Panzer Division de venir renforcer les troupes allemandes. Chaque sc&eacute;nario poss&egrave;de ses propres cartes (dont les cartes h&eacute;ro&iuml;ques) et des m&eacute;caniques de jeu diff&eacute;rentes.<br/><br/>Pour gagner, l'Anglais doit remplir sa mission (qui d&eacute;pend du sc&eacute;nario), en remportant l'assaut sur un ou plusieurs terrains objectifs. Pour gagner, l'Allemand doit emp&ecirc;cher l'Anglais d'atteindre son but, g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement en lui faisant perdre tous ses Points d'Effectifs, ou, dans le sc&eacute;nario de la Dives, en l'emp&ecirc;chant de d&eacute;truire deux des quatre ponts.<br/><br/>Les trois sc&eacute;narios peuvent &ecirc;tre jou&eacute;s &agrave; la suite, en mode &quot;campagne&quot;, pour recr&eacute;er cette nuit historique. En fonction de ses r&eacute;sultats, l'Anglais obtient plus ou moins de points de campagne, et quand les trois sc&eacute;narios ont &eacute;t&eacute; jou&eacute;s, son score total indique si le D&eacute;barquement sur les plages de Gold, Juno et Sword pourra avoir lieu ou non.<br/><br/>Les 120 illustrations de cartes sont r&eacute;alistes et fid&egrave;les aux documents historiques (uniformes, armes, lieux...)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Space Mission, players explore eight planets (randomly selected from twelve in the game) by flying from planet to neighboring planet or passing through a &quot;jump gate&quot; that allows them to travel anywhere. Each planet has a different combination of values for jumping to it, scanning it and landing on it.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand of five cards, with each card having three color-coded values on it: blue for jumping, green for scanning, and orange for landing. On a turn, you take two actions from six possibilities, with the same action being possible:<br/><br/>&mdash;Top up: Discard any number of cards (including zero), then refill your hand to five cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;Jump: Move your spaceship from the jump gate (where players start the game) or a planet to any other planet by discarding a card that shows the landing value of the target planet. Place one of your tokens on the jump gate.<br/><br/>&mdash;Fly: Move your spaceship to either neighboring planet; this move is free.<br/><br/>&mdash;Scan: Discard a card with the scanning value of the planet where your spaceship is currently located; look through the face-down planet tiles, place one aside face-down with your marker on it, then return the tiles to that planet. This action is possible only on undeveloped planets.<br/><br/>&mdash;Develop: Develop the planet where your spaceship is located by discarding two cards that match the two landing values shown on that planet. Mark this planet with your space station token, hand out all scanned and claimed planet tiles to the appropriate players, claim one remaining planet tile for yourself, then place the remaining tiles face-down again. A planet can be developed only once.<br/><br/>&mdash;Discover: Take a planet tile of your choice from the developed planet where your spaceship is currently located.<br/><br/>If at any point, all of the planet tiles on a planet show only empty space, the player holding the tiles lays them face-up next to that planet. When 6-12 space tiles have been revealed, an amount based on the number of players, the game ends and players tally their points.<br/><br/>Each type of planet tile scores in a different way. With Minerals, for example, you multiply the number of mineral tiles you hold with the largest number of mineral tiles in a single color. Medals are worth three points each. A green-blue pair of Matter tiles is worth seven points, while a single Matter tile is worth only two. Each space station you've built is worth three points, and the players score 9, 6, 3 and 1 for having the most, secondmost, etc. tokens on the jump gate. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    Jump Gate<br/><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Yucata (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>",

Each at-bat starts on the pitcher card to determine the quality of the pitch and then flows to the batter card to resolve the at-bat.  This is all done quickly and effortlessly using either dice and charts or an alternate Fast Action Card (FAC) system.<br/><br/>The dice version of the game uses two six-sided and two ten-sided dice.  The Fast Action Card version of the game includes 112 cards. Both the print and PDF versions can be played with either dice or cards (or both if one chooses). The only difference between the versions is one is printed and shipped and the other is downloaded. PDF purchasers will need to supply their own dice, but otherwise receive the same materials printed game purchasers receive.<br/><br/>Each player card is based on the player's actual statistics for a given season and most teams have 32 to 35 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Talat, originally published in an all-wood edition under the name Drei, is an abstract strategy game specifically designed for three players. Each pair of players shares a game board, forcing each player to pay attention to two different gaming scenarios at once. The goal is to capture the opponents' pieces and to move your own pieces to the opponents' starting rows.<br/><br/>Players have nine towers in three heights and three shapes (squared, hexagonal and triangular prisms). To set up the game, players lay out the game boards, then take turns placing towers one by one on the starting edges of their game boards, five towers on one board and four on the other.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must move one tower one space forward, either straight or diagonally; the player can choose freely which tower to move on which game board, but moving on one board precludes movement on the other, so choose wisely! A tower can capture another tower by moving onto its space, but only in the right circumstances. If the two towers are the same height, the capturing tower must have more sides than the one being captured; if their heights differ, the capturing tower must be one level taller than the tower being captured. The exception is the smallest triangular tower, which can capture the opponent's tallest hexagonal tower. A tower can also move sideways when capturing, but not when merely moving on the game board; thus, even after a tower reaches the opponent's back row, it might still be at risk of capture (or possibly the one doing the capturing).<br/><br/>If no captures are possible on a game board, that board is frozen and players can no longer move their pieces on it. As soon as two boards are frozen, the game ends. Players score five points for each tower they've captured and three points for each of their own towers that has reached an opponent's starting edge. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "String Railway: Transport is a follow-up game to String Railway, a train game in which the play area is created by placing varying lengths of colored string representing different types of terrain. The board is initially seeded with all the stations (unlike in String Railway) placed randomly inside the boundary string and filled with two goods cubes.<br/><br/>Each turn, players must place one string that connects stations. Then players have a number of action points to use. Players start with a 3 AP locomotive, and can upgrade to better locomotives that provide up to 6 AP per turn. Action points are used to moving goods cubes (1 AP to move from station to station). If a cube reaches a station of the same colour as the cube itself, the cube is then scored.<br/><br/>White cubes are special long distance cubes. Players have mission cards that show three stations in particular order. In order to fulfill the mission, the player must move a long-distance cube through the stations in right order. The reward depends on how many stations player moves the cube through. Unfulfilled mission is worth -2. Moving the cube through one station gets rid of the penalty. Two stations gets rid of the penalty and gives the player the white cube, which is scored as a wild cube. Three stations scores 5 points on top of that.<br/><br/>After five rounds, the cubes are scored. Each set of five cubes of different colours is worth 15 points, 4-cube sets are 10 points, 3-cube sets are 6 points, 2-cube sets are 3 points and remaining single cube sets give 1 point each. White wild cubes can be very useful at this point. Unfulfilled missions are -2 points, while perfectly fulfilled missions are +5 points.<br/><br/>In addition of moving cubes, action points can be used for upgrading locomotives and replenishing goods cubes. Collected goods cubes can be discarded to gain AP. Players can also draw new mission cards and each player has a personal station they can place on board at some point in game.<br/><br/>String Railway: Transport, with a playing time of approx. 15 minutes per player, differs from the original game by adding cargo delivery and removing the values of stations. Transport is an individual game, not an expansion. The games are not compatible: you can't play String Railway with the components of Transport (the stations are different and there's no river).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Winner of the 2018 Best Combinatorial Game award, Blooms is a 2-player game where players capture each other&rsquo;s pieces by surrounding them.<br/><br/>It was inspired by the classical game Go and a painting in an Oregon coffee shop.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/><br/>     Bloom: a bloom is an entire group of connected stones on the board of the same color. A single stone (unconnected to others of the same color) is also a bloom.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Fenced: a bloom is fenced when there are no empty spaces adjacent to any of the bloom&rsquo;s stones.<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/><br/>     Each player owns 2 colors of stones. To start, Player 1 places 1 stone of either of her colors on any empty space.<br/>     From then on, starting with Player 2, the players take turns. On your turn, you must place 1 or 2 stones onto any empty spaces. If you place 2, they must be different colors. Then capture all fenced enemy blooms.<br/>     The first player to have captured X stones wins.<br/><br/><br/>The key is you can and usually should sacrifice your own stones to gain positional advantage. It's common for players to get 10 or more points down in games played to 20, and still win. This is important because new players often don't see the value of sacrifice and lose without having any idea what happened, which isn't fun.<br/><br/><br/>     See diagrams and gifs here<br/>     Play online at Board Game Arena<br/><br/><br/>",

When you remove a token, you see through a hole in the box that reveals part of the topmost line drawing. If the player wants, they can guess what the drawing represents, after which they pull the card out of the box to see whether they are correct, scoring points based on the number of tokens removed if correct and losing points otherwise.<br/><br/>After ten rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ve never seen a device like this! Peek through this curious contraption&rsquo;s round holes at the image hidden inside. Can you tell a rhino from a pizza just from a few swirling lines? Take a good look at the partially revealed image, guess what it could be and score points if you are right! The fewer holes you need to open in order to recognize the image, the more points you get.

This war pitted the superior wealth and naval power of Athens against the militarism of Sparta. It was a bloody contest, with many heroic triumphs and great atrocities. Victory by Sparta ended the Golden Age of Greece.<br/><br/>This game provides insight into why the war was fought the way it was. One player controls the wealthy and sea faring Athenians, the other the powerful armies of the Spartans. The object is to control important city-states that dotted the Grecian landscape.<br/><br/>In order to create a fog of war, unit blocks are stood up with the backs facing the opponent. In this manner the opponent cannot tell the type or the strength of the units being deployed against him until battle begins. Along the sides of the unit blocks, only visible to the owner until it comes time for combat, are numbers that represent the strength of the unit. The current strength is on top. As the unit takes losses, it is rotated so a lesser value is on top.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players simultaneously choose a location, and if they're the only one to pick a location, they get the card or cards in that location. If you choose the same location as someone else, each of you receives a &quot;hazy memory&quot; card that features a wallpaper pattern along only one edge instead of along all four edges.<br/><br/>When you receive regular wallpaper cards, you must add them to your other played cards immediately, ideally matching the pattern halves to create a complete pattern. Patterns come in four colors, with each color having two sizes. A wild pattern is also available, which seems kind of weird, but so be it. To end a turn, deal a new wallpaper card to each location, which means that some locations will likely have more cards than other ones.<br/><br/>At game's end, use your hazy memory cards to complete patterns on the edge of your wallpaper, then score for each color of pattern. The score of a pattern is the number of large symbols of that color multiplied by the number of small symbols, so if you don't have at least one large and small symbol, you score nothing for that color!<br/><br/>",

You can use combination of dice or use specials to manipulate the results, but you also have to fulfill conditions and use all dice.<br/>The game ends, when you decide to leave or when you needed too much time and turned the alarm on. Then your final score is calculated based on the loot you get and your overall performance as a thief.<br/><br/>This game was designed during the corona lockdown and is free to download as a print &amp; play, to bring some boardgames to everybody during the social distance time. You can also support your local game store with this game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trigger!/D&eacute;clic !? is a (French) party game testing your reaction and coordination abilities. The game is easy to learn and provides a vivid atmosphere with lots of laughter.<br/><br/>To prepare the game, a plastic disk is placed in the centre of the table and each player marks one of his hands &quot;true&quot; and the other &quot;false&quot; (or one can say that the right hand is &quot;true&quot; and the left hand is &quot;false&quot;).<br/><br/>In a turn, a question is read out loud and all the players have to answer with &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot; as fast as possible, using their hands. For instance, if the answer is &quot;true&quot;, one places his right hand on the plastic disk, as such creating a pile of hands on top of the disk. Please mind that the answer to the question might vary as a function of the number of players, the players itself, etc (see below). Mind that once you've put your hand, you cannot change your answer anymore.<br/><br/>Once all players have answered the question, i.e. have placed one of their hands on the pile of hands, scoring begins. The upper hand scores +1 point if its answer is correct or -1 point if its answer is incorrect. The second hand (from the top) will score +2 if its answer is correct or -2 if its answer is incorrect, and so on. For instance, in a 8 player game, the lower hand (on the plastic disk) scores +8 points for a correct answer or -8 points for an incorrect answer.<br/><br/>Players really have to take risks to improve their score, answering quickly and so having their hand smashed.<br/><br/>To give you an idea of the questions, there are several types:<br/>Concerning the reader of the question (I am a man)<br/>Concerning the player (You have a dog)<br/>Concerning the environment/location (We play in a bar)<br/>General questions (King Kong was an ape)<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as a player has scored a specific number of points, e.g. 30 points in a 8 player game.<br/><br/>Additional rules for some variations are included (like changing hands and playing in teams).<br/><br/>Reimplemented by:<br/><br/>    Hand aufs Herz<br/><br/><br/>",

There are Stupefy! cards and Misspell cards (it happens to the best of us).

Avoid being Stupefied by your opponents along the way, otherwise you&rsquo;ll be known as the latecomer (penalty) of your House and miss the chance to gain extra rewards. After 8 rounds, once all the rewards have been claimed, the House with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>Rounds are tense!

Stacks of treasure tiles are set up between the players, sorted by size and shape. Each tile holds a different number of treasures (one to four) and shows a different combination of varying kinds of treasure. <br/>To play, a player rolls the five treasure dice. Each die is covered with six kinds of Egyptian archeological treasures, the artifacts of Pharaoh Teubernus: a gold lamp, a gold coin, a scarab beetle, a lapis lazuli vase, a piece of gold and jade jewelry, and a hippo statuette.<br/><br/>A player can collect any treasure tile that matches the symbols he or she has rolled. For strategic reasons, a player might be better off rerolling some or all of his or her dice to try to match a particular shape and pattern of tile. Players can roll the dice up to three times in all per turn. <br/>Players can rotate treasure tiles in any direction when placing them on their excavation site grids, but they may not move the tiles once they are laid down. Tiles cannot overlap one another or hang beyond the edges of a board. <br/>The first player to cover his or her excavation site board completely with treasure tiles wins the game.<br/><br/>In an easier version of the game, players are allowed to shift their treasure tiles around after placing them down, which makes it less difficult for kids to pick and use additional tiles to cover the board.<br/><br/>",

Normally monsters or treasure need to be entirely covered with marker to be collected, but rogues need only to touch treasure, while barbarians need only to fill in the monsters' heads to defeat them! While anyone can cast a spell by tracing an intricate pattern, a wizard needs only to draw a small circle!<br/><br/>Dungeon Scrawlers contains ten unique mazes of increasing complexity, introducing new challenges as you go. These include portals, locked doors, multiple bosses, time limits, and more!

A green sea of grass rolls gently in the wind, spotted with flowers opening up to morning dew and gentle sunlight, and flocks of butterflies hovering above in a slow, deliberate dance. Light flickers in the golden dust, as you take the first look through your lens and get ready to capture the most beautiful of sights in your photo!<br/><br/>Dust in the Wings is a family game of perception, planning, and picturing the beauty of nature. Built on the wisdom of Mancala &mdash; a beloved game known for thousands of years &mdash; Dust in the Wings creates an experience that is light on rules, engaging in its gameplay, and wondrous to the eye!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, Butterflies are placed on each flower in the Meadow, a 5&times;5 grid on the main game board. During each turn, a player attempts to fulfill the requirements of various objectives in order to score victory points.<br/><br/>The board is manipulated Mancala style. The active player will choose a single Meadow space and pick up all Butterflies from that space. One by one, these Butterflies are dispersed. The first Butterfly is placed onto any one Meadow space adjacent to the space which the Butterflies were picked up from. The next Butterfly is placed onto any one Meadow space adjacent to that space, and so on.<br/><br/>The goal is to place the last Butterfly onto a Meadow space so that the space fulfills the requirement of a Gathering objective or Composition objective.<br/><br/>A Gathering objective is fulfilled by gathering a precise number and types of Butterflies onto a single space in the Meadow.<br/><br/>A Composition objective is fulfilled by having a group of spaces that collectively contain a number of Butterflies indicated on the cards. The group of spaces must also match a distinct shape and size depicted on the card.<br/><br/>Even if you managed to fulfill the requirements of multiple cards, only one card may be scored each turn.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, a player's score is calculated. Each Composition card is worth a number of points as indicated on the card. The values of various Scoring markers, which were collected when completing Gathering objectives, are also added to the final tally.<br/><br/>The player with the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the distant future. The world has become a dangerous place where the balance of power rests between opposing forces known as Factions. These groups manipulate and influence the citizens of the Community in an effort to join their side and vanquish the opposition.<br/><br/>Each Faction uses movement and control to turn the tide against their opposition. By expanding influence over the Community, power can be acquired. Choose a side and become the Master of Wills.<br/><br/>Master of Wills can be played one-versus-one or two-versus-two. It&rsquo;s all about moving the cards&mdash;you want to move as many points to your side of the board as possible while your opponent is trying to do the same for their side. Community cards are each assigned a value, and each card is represented by a character from one of the eight sectors of the Community. Moving those cards can trigger the basic movement of other cards on the board.<br/><br/>The cards move from a neutral area in the middle of the board toward your side or the opponent&rsquo;s side through three rows. Each row represents how close the character is to joining your Faction. The rows are called Recruits, Loyalists, and Allies. Each row represents how loyal the character is to your side. If they reach your Allies, those points are locked in.<br/><br/>When the game begins, each player will choose a Faction and build a deck of Faction cards that caters to their own style. These Faction cards allow for even more powerful card movement. For instance, let&rsquo;s say you choose a Faction card that says, &ldquo;Choose any card from your opponent&rsquo;s Recruits or Loyalists and move to your Allies.&rdquo; Then imagine your opponent has a card with a 15-point value in their Loyalists row. You can snatch up that valuable card and lock it into the Allies row on your side of the board, giving you a large number of points and taking those same points away from the opponent. A single, well-timed Faction card can be a serious game changer.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game&rsquo;s (very dark) heart is still the same as its predecessor: Players are trying to keep their orphan(s) safe from a boogeyman. Unfortunately, that means sometimes throwing the other orphans under the proverbial bus.<br/><br/>House of Rath differs significantly in its gameplay, however. It combines elements of deduction, &ldquo;take that,&rdquo; and map reduction to create suspense, but the real difference lies in one key point: During every turn, you&rsquo;re playing as both the orphans and the boogeyman!<br/><br/>During the Roll phase, you&rsquo;ll do whatever it takes to protect your orphans from the dreaded boogeyman, Count Rath: lock doors, rotate rooms, travel via secret passages, and even reveal other hidden orphans. Every decision could be the one that takes your orphans to (relative) safety&mdash;or straight into Rath&rsquo;s greedy clutches. You&rsquo;ll then use the Boogeyman Phase of your turn (while playing as Rath) to suss out which orphans belong to whom, all while steering Rath clear of your orphans (and keeping secret which ones are your orphans when possible).<br/><br/>If one of your orphans is discovered by Rath, your chances of getting away are slim. But hey&hellip;a chance is a chance, right? You&rsquo;ll either escape (likely to be pursued again at a later time) or come to a grisly end and draw a Run Away card. Though a Run Away card won&rsquo;t help you when it&rsquo;s drawn, it&rsquo;ll give you options later. Use it to give your other orphans better odds of escaping if they&rsquo;re discovered, or use the card&rsquo;s one-of-a-kind special ability.<br/><br/>The last player with at least one surviving orphan is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dark Deeds is a darkly humorous card game of skullduggery and suspicion for 2 to 5 players. In Dark Deeds players take the role of minions in service to a powerful, mysterious, and clearly villainous, patron. The Patron wants deeds of infamy, violence and coercion committed and you are the ones who must avoid the authorities, the do-gooders and, most of all, each other to perform them. Rich rewards beckon, along with horrific punishments for failure. So are you the kind of malevolent minion the patron needs?<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s a &lsquo;street&rsquo; deck for the minion&rsquo;s prospective targets &ndash; clerics, artisans, and merchants and their protective guards from the city watch. Then there&rsquo;s a &lsquo;tavern&rsquo; deck with potentially useful loot and plot cards to help the minions get the job done. The implacable hand of evil is revealed by the nemesis cards in the street deck &ndash; princes, politicians, and do-gooders the player&rsquo;s evil patron wants eliminated. The tavern deck includes &lsquo;Dark Deeds&rsquo;, specific missions to take out particular nemeses (that&rsquo;s the plural of nemesis in case you&rsquo;re wondering). Picking up a Dark Deed is a very mixed blessing. A rich reward is earned for completing it, but it can&rsquo;t be discarded and the patron will exact a heavy price for any incomplete Dark Deeds held at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The masterful touch is how the street deck is laid out to create a constantly moving scene of different characters. Each turn the street moves along, the card closest to the end leaves and everyone else shuffles up with empty spaces filled from the deck. Minions enter from one end of the street and have to get past any intervening guards to reach their targets.<br/><br/>",

Rather than each imp paying for its own drink, however, they play a dice game to determine who's buying the next round of Diavolo, the &quot;drink that keeps imps really red in the face&quot;.<br/><br/>Each turn in Diavolo, someone rolls the ten dice: three each of red, black and white, and one special big grey die. This last die &ndash; the &quot;order&quot; die, if you will &ndash; gives players an order, and they must then decide as quickly as possible which of the colored imp pieces they must grab. An order might have them checking which color of dice has the largest or smallest sum, which color has the biggest difference between two dice, which color die is closest to the gray die, and so on.<br/><br/>If a player takes the wrong imp (or no imp at all), he loses one of his gems. When all but one player have been eliminated, this final player wins.<br/><br/>If you're getting low on gems, don't despair as you can sometimes gain more. If the instruction on the order die would allow you to grab two (or even three) imps, then you must instead grab the gray imp. Doing so nets you a gem &ndash; unless, of course, you're wrong.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Don't get caught in the sun!<br/><br/> Till Dawn, a 20&ndash;30-minute game for 4-8 vampires (or 12, with the expansion), takes place over the course of three nights during which time all self respecting vampires leave their coffins to hunt. A deck of hunt cards is passed from vampire to vampire, each taking one card, reading it aloud, then passing the rest on. If a feeding card is drawn, all vampires gain blood tokens &mdash; but the deck is also loaded with events, vampire slayers, a vicious werewolf, invitations from the elders, and the creeping threat of sunrise. Feeling lucky? At any time during a hunt, a vampire may return to his coffin to protect his precious blood tokens. Return to your coffin too early, though, and you may miss all the fun. Then again, centuries of hunting should have taught you the folly of pushing your luck too far...<br/><br/> Till Dawn comes in a coffin-shaped box with approximately 120 cards, more than one hundred tokens, eight character cards, and a &quot;night advancement&quot; track. (An additional pack of four characters will be available to expand your game to 12 players.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Early Klaus Teuber game with a well deserved reputation, from a publisher better known for electronic games! The odd combination of mechanisms is a bit tricky to grasp at first, but soon reveals a nice contest. There are various ships in different colors marked on the board and players are dealt 3 random cards to show a share in three of the ships. Also on the board are treasure chests with rising values, and colored markers for each ship move from chest to chest, showing the worth of that vessel. Players begin with cash, 3 Smithy &amp; 3 Trade card, and some lucky horseshoes that they keep on a rack hidden from the other players. These are variously numbered and two dice are rolled at each turn to provide the lucky number.<br/><br/>As the Flying Dutchman sails the seven seas, it can either move onto islands or the ships. If it is moved onto a ship, players reveal if they are share holders and pay the current value back to the bank as its marker is moved down to zero. On your turn, you can opt to use your Trade card to exchange 2 of your share cards, effectively dodging the Dutchman's threat. Or you can play a Smithy card, to allow you to take horseshoes at the end of the turn. But mainly you can attempt to control the Dutchman's move, by secretly laying down horseshoes to match the lucky number, the closest winning control. A nice rule, if there's a tie, the players are meant to try to agree, then barter, and finally compete with more horseshoes (all to the benefit of the Smithy card players!). Played horseshoes are pooled until Smithies divy them up.<br/><br/>If the Dutchman is moved to an island, the controlling players reveal a share card and take the value of that ship from the bank. The round ends with all the chest markers moving up once, including a black marker, which ends the game when it reaches the highest chest. Players reveal their share cards and take the final value on the chests, most money wins.<br/><br/>Puzzling to begin with, but you quickly realize whether your shares are under threat from a Dutchman's move, so you either trade out or try to gain control. If you're not under threat, it may be worth use your Smithy to grab the pool of horseshoes. Get your timing right and the whole thing becomes very rewarding. Simple choices, not perfectly balanced, but the players at times co-operate or struggle, making for an entertaining voyage.<br/><br/>Winner of the 1992 Deutscher Spiele Preis.<br/><br/>",

Players build while battling both monstrous diseases and fellow park-builders with creative differences concerning how the park should be laid out. The object of the game is to score points by placing your park tiles into the best spots within the body. Move your character pawn around the park to scout out the best locations and stay away from (or shoot) the monster diseases that will pop up and cause chaos. Whoever has the most victory points wins and is the master builder of Anatomy Park!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Preference is a standard deck playing card game played throughout central Europe and Russia using a 32 card &quot;Bavarian&quot; deck like the one used in Schafkopf.  The major varieties of Preference are Croatian, Austrian, and Russian and there are variations of each as well.  Generally a three player game, a fourth player can play by having the dealer of each hand sit out for the round.  Following is a brief description of the Croatian version of the game, and below are links to rule sets for the Croatian, Austrian, and Russian versions.<br/><br/>Each of the suits has a predetermined value:<br/>Leaves = 2<br/>Bells = 3<br/>Hearts = 4<br/>Acorns = 5<br/><br/>The dealer deals out all 32 cards - 10 to each player and 2 to the &quot;talon&quot; (crib).  Each player in turn bids one of the suits for trump, or can bid the value 6 game where the declarer(bid winner) can attempt to take no tricks and the other two must try to force him to do so, or the 7 game where there is no trump suit. The highest bid becomes the declarer, takes the two cards from the &quot;talon&quot; and discards two, and then must take 6 tricks to succeed in the game he bid for or a higher one.  The opposing players have the option to play in which they must get two tricks to succeed.  If only one player is opposing, he may request the aid of the other non-declaring player in an attempt to make the declarer fail in his bid, but takes all the bonuses or penalties for doing so.  Non bid hands means a double scoring round in the next hand, and &quot;kontra&quot; may be offered to double the stakes of a hand a player is confident in making the declarer fail (and can be &quot;rekontra&quot; and &quot;sukontra&quot; or doubled and doubled again and again!).<br/><br/>The players start out with a set number of points (usually 100 each) and the game goes until the total of all three players equals zero.  Tricks taken when opposing a contract score some points for the player and against those players in the final tally.  <br/><br/><br/>",

Birds may not be placed directly adjacent to other friendly birds and may only move (&quot;fly&quot;) towards other birds if they enlarge an existing friendly flock. Flocks may never be split, so players are forced to add new birds to the game, and this is actually where the competition unfolds.<br/><br/>If an opponent's birds are isolated by the active player dividing the board in multiple regions through flock movement, the active player must remove trapped birds from the board, which may benefit the opponent.<br/><br/>If a player ends up with one contiguous flock (of any size), he wins.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/>      Boardspace.net Real time, against humans or robot players<br/><br/><br/>Mobile Apps<br/><br/>     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, IOS<br/>     Boardspace.net local multiplayer or online, Android<br/><br/><br/>",

Well, most players fall into that category, but one takes the role of marshal and tries to keep the other players honest.<br/><br/>During set-up, a money tile is placed in each bank, a poker tile in each city without a bank, and a stagecoach in a randomly-determined city. Each outlaw starts in a city, and the marshal has both a marshal token and a number of sheriffs equal to the number of outlaws, with these tokens starting wherever the marshal places them.<br/><br/>The game lasts five turns, with five movement cards played by each player in each turn. Each player has an individual hand of movement cards, including a &quot;Saloon&quot; card that allows a player to stay in the same location. The marshal moves the stagecoach, moves each sheriff (or leaves them in place), then the marshal and the outlaws alternate laying five face-down movement cards. If an outlaw wants to take an action in a city &ndash; robbing a bank, a card game, or a stagecoach &ndash; he must show his location card to the marshal, then place his wooden disk on that location.<br/><br/>Once all five movement cards have been placed, the players all reveal the first card and move their tokens. If the marshal is in the same city as an outlaw, that player is jailed and loses all movement and action for the remainder of the turn; that player also loses that movement card for the remainder of the game. If an outlaw is in a location with his action disk, he can take that action &ndash; as long as more outlaws are present than sheriffs. (Players pool their money, so there's no dispute over which outlaw robbed a place.)<br/><br/>Once players finish their five movements, they pick up all their movement cards, the marshal replaces stolen tiles (and adds a second stagecoach in the second turn), and a new turn begins. If at the end of the game, the desperados have collected $4,000 or more per outlaw, then they win the game; otherwise the marshal wins as the outlaws &ndash; despite stealing huge amounts of funds &ndash; have not secured enough funds to guarantee their livelihood in their golden years.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Prime Climb is a new board game that uses arithmetic to open a beautiful world of possibility. Players race to be the first to get to the center of the board while avoiding getting knocked back to the start by other players. Highlighting the power of the prime numbers, Prime Climb is mathematical, deep, creative, and fun.<br/><br/>Each player controls two pawns that start at the 0 circle. Players take turns rolling two 10-sided dice and applying the values to their two pawns using any of the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The first to get both pawns into the 101 circle exactly wins the game! Be careful: if another player lands on you, you get sent back to the start. Along the way, players who land on the red circles collect Prime cards&mdash;some are helpful now, some are helpful later, and a few are trouble!<br/><br/>One of the great innovations of Prime Climb is the coloring scheme. Each of the prime numbers less than 10 has its own color: 2 is orange, 3 is green, 5 is blue, and 7 is purple. After 10, each prime number is red. Any number that is not a prime is a mix of colors that corresponds to its prime factors. For example, 14 = 2 x 7, so the 14 circle is half orange and half purple.<br/><br/>The color coding allows players a way to quickly analyze the factors and multiples of the numbers on the board. This helps players check their multiplication and division, and even allows kids who haven't yet learned multiplication to play the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The decision to invade The Marianas (of which Saipan is a part) was not an easy one. General MacArthur still favored the more westerly route through the Philippines and had support amongst the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It took several conferences and nearly a year before the decision was made. There were several reasons that the Americans finally decided to invade the Marianas: Firstly, it was the most direct route to Japan, Secondly, they could base B29 bombers there which could bomb Tokyo, Thirdly, Saipan would be the first piece of prewar Japanese soil taken during the war. Lastly, the American planners hoped that they could draw the Japanese fleet into a decisive engagement. With all these reasons, a battle for the Marianas was inevitable.<br/><br/>On 15th June 1944 71,000 American Marines and Infantry attempted to make the plan work. 32,000 dug-in Japanese attempted to stop them.<br/><br/>Saipan &ndash; The Bloody Rock will be the first game to utilize the new Company Scale System (CSS) by Adam Starkweather and will come on 2 maps. This will be your chance to experience a full-on naval invasion as Amtracs and DUKWs head towards the emplaced forces of Imperial Japan.<br/><br/>The game will come with 4 scenarios and 2 campaign games:<br/><br/>Dog-Day &ndash; The first day of the Invasion. It is 8 turns long and fought on a single map. An excellent introduction to both the system and the game.<br/><br/>First Week in Hell &ndash; The first week of the invasion and the capture of Aslito airfield. This scenario is 56 turns long and is played on a single map. For the space but not time challenged players among you.<br/><br/>Death Valley &ndash; This scenario covers a single day of the fighting and concentrates on the American attempt to capture Mount Tapotchau and the area that became know as Death Valley. 8 turns long and a single map. An excellent large battle you can play over one sitting.<br/><br/>Shattered Jewels - This scenario covers a single day of fighting and revolves around the largest Banzai attack of the war. Thousands of Japanese attack the 105th Regiment near the town of Tanapag. Variable length but usually 4-5 turns.<br/><br/>The Battle for Saipan &ndash; The full historical campaign from 15th June- 9th July (224 Turns). This game covers the full fight for Saipan in 1944, from the first invasion at Charan Kanoa in the south, through the long bloody fight in the central mountains around Mount Tapotchao and finally to the last Japanese stand in the north.<br/><br/>Bloody Rock &ndash; This is a hypothetical campaign game that lets the players decide how to defend Saipan and how to invade it. The American player receives the same historical forces but now has the opportunity to devise his own landing schedule over one of 25 beaches. The Japanese player gets to prepare his own defenses; set up pillboxes, lay mines and deploy 6&rdquo; naval guns etc. Can you do better than history?<br/><br/>Complexity: 6<br/><br/>Solitaire Suitability:8<br/><br/>Time Scale: 1 turn = 2 hours<br/><br/>Map Scale: 1 hex = 500 meters<br/><br/>Unit Scale: Companies and below<br/><br/>Players: Best with 2 players but can be played with up to 4 players as well as solitaire<br/><br/>",

Sometimes they need to banter and fight for prices. And sometimes they have to swallow their tears and abandon all they have built. If you can overcome these hurdles, earn the trust of people and build up a fortune, then you will be a true master merchant.<br/><br/>Master Merchant is a &quot;hand-building&quot; card game along the lines of the &quot;deck-building&quot; genre started by Dominion, except that players have no deck &ndash; only a hand of cards and a discard pile.<br/><br/>Players start with a hand of two cards: &quot;Steal one gold from all players with four or more gold&quot; and &quot;Buy a card from the town&quot;. On each turn a player can play up to two cards from his hand, either face up to gain a card's effect or face down to gain one gold.<br/><br/>The &quot;town&quot; consists of ten different types of cards, which cost 1-4 gold. All cards played and purchased go into a player's personal discard pile, which is open information to all players. If a player starts his turn with no cards, he picks up his entire discard pile. The first player to get eight gold or eight different cards wins the game.<br/><br/>This game's setting is same as Mai-Star, which is from the same designer, artist and publisher.<br/><br/>",

Players draft cards through the mechanism used in the original Zooloretto; each turn a player adds a card to one of the piles or takes a pile. They score points for having the majority of animals in a species when a specific number of this species is in the zoos. The game includes six different species. Some of the animal cards have symbols triggering special actions when a player takes a second card of this species with the same symbol:<br/><br/><br/>    Heart: The player takes a baby animal of that species, if available.<br/>    Card: The player looks through the discard pile and takes a card of their choice. <br/>    Lightning bolt: The player must take a -1 point marker.<br/><br/><br/>If a player collects a symbol a third time, the special action is not carried out; instead the player discards the card and takes a -1 point marker.<br/><br/>Some cards have food stalls, which give you money if you have the same symbol (pretzels, soft drinks, or ice cream) twice. This money can be used to steal an animal from the opponent or get rid of all -1 point markers. The first player to have all different types of stalls scores bonus points.<br/><br/>The end of the game is triggered after the sixth in-game scoring or when the &quot;last round&quot; card is revealed. After the endgame scoring, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

This is not a simplified, beginner version of Dungeons &amp; Dragons; it is an experience unto itself that leverages the fun of pen-and-paper games and lets players have quick, fun adventures together.<br/><br/>The Siblings Trouble is influenced by Miyazaki, The Goonies, The Hardy Boys, and even Pikmin.

Each player controls 2-4 different lines, depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>On each turn, four destination cards are available, corresponding to stations on the map. You can take up to four actions; an action is either building track by placing one of your track tokens on the board or taking a branch token. A player may use two branch tokens to branch out of an existing line (whereas normally lines can be extended only at the endpoints). After each player's turn, a passenger token is moved along players' lines, avoiding walking as much as possible, to reach one or two destinations determined at the beginning of the turn. Destination cards corresponding to the visited stations are then replaced by new ones, then the next player takes their turn.<br/><br/>Players score points in two ways:<br/><br/><br/>     By building track and connecting their lines to various types of stations, by collecting landmark tiles (in Paris), by connecting stations across water (in New York) or at the end of the game if they have achieved their secret objectives (in Paris).<br/><br/><br/><br/>     By having the passenger use their lines when moving.<br/><br/><br/>After all destination cards have been drawn and all players have taken the same number of turns, the game ends.<br/><br/>Paris is a thoughtful map offering many options. To win, you need to strike the right balance between collecting sets of tokens, connecting secret destinations, blocking other players while not being blocked yourself, and of course carrying the passenger. Paris is the refined elder sister of the original On the Underground: London map and is recommended for experienced players.<br/><br/>New York is a fast-paced map reflecting the hectic pace of life in the Big Apple. It encourages players to mirror real life by creating lines through Manhattan, but you have to build quickly to keep up with the always-moving passenger.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Screaming Eagles in Holland: The 101st Airborne Division's Defense of Hell's Highway, 22-23 September, 1944, covers the intense fighting from 22-23 September during Operation Market-Garden in and near Veghel, Holland by the American 101st Airborne Division.  The 101st has battled their way to the small Dutch village of Veghel.  All they need do now is await the arrival of XXX Corps on their way to Nijmegen and beyond to Arnhem. As fate would have it, the Germans planned otherwise. German armor and infantry conducted several determined attacks on the positions held by the 101st.<br/><br/>Operation Market-Garden is usually best remembered for the stubborn defence of the Arnhem Bridge by the British 1st Airborne. The equally important role of the two American Airborne Divisions is often neglected. Screaming Eagles in Holland covers the crucial defence of the Veghel bridges by the 101st Airborne. At Veghel, the Germans launched their most concentrated and determined effort to sever the vital supply and reinforcement route of Hell&rsquo;s Highway to the embattled British 1st Airborne at Arnhem.<br/><br/>Screaming Eagles is the 13th game in the Tactical Combat Series.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 20 minutes<br/>Hex: 125 yards / 114 meters<br/>Units: Platoons &amp; individual vehicles<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (840 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 28-page Tactical Combat Series ver 3.1 rulebook<br/>One 16-page Screaming Eagles in Holland rulebook<br/>Two dual-side printed Tactical Combat Series ver 3.1 charts &amp; tables folders<br/>Two dual-side printed Op Planning Sheets<br/>One Morale &amp; Turn Record Chart<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 6-20 hours<br/><br/>",

It includes four high quality hero miniatures, 15 unique &quot;outlander&quot; standees and is played on a board with 3-D features.  Outlanders (hyenas, snakes and vultures) invade the Pride Lands from different locations while the Lion Guard heroes race to remove them from the board.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player draws from the deck and adds an outlander creature to the board as pictured in the top half of the card.  Then a choice is given to the player to move one of two heroes, as shown on the bottom half of the card, up to a number of spaces listed. If a hero lands on a space with an outlander, the outlander is removed from the board.  There are also &quot;Power Cards&quot; that provide a bonus effect, such as removing any one outlander from the board.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to move Kion to the top of &quot;Pride Rock&quot; before the outlanders get to their winning space.

Lang. The set will feature Superman and Wonder Woman along with other Kryptonians and Amazons, with new spins on 8 DC heroes (and their dice).<br/><br/>Dice Masters is a collectible dice-building tabletop game designed by Quarriors! creators Michael Elliott and Eric M. Lang.<br/><br/>In this game, each player fields one of the superhero teams, with each hero being represented by custom-tooled dice; each team must be composed of up to 20 dice, and a player can &quot;purchase&quot; dice only from his team. Each hero also has one or more character reference cards, which show the special abilities for the characters based on the die rolls. Players use these dice to collect energy, recruit new heroes, and battle head-to-head. In addition, each player brings two basic action cards to the game, which are placed in the center of the table; both players can purchase these cards. A player wins once the opposing player has been reduced to zero life.<br/><br/>The starter set comes with 44 custom dice, 38 cards, two dice bags, and a core rulebook.<br/><br/>",

At the end of each round, gain  points for cards in your mountain and delta.<br/><br/>The basic rules introduce the four player actions: Weathering,  Hillslope, Fluvial, and Draw Cards. The advanced rules add details: atmospheric change, ice  ages, glaciers, flood volcanism, quakes, etc.<br/><br/>Mountains are far more dynamic than the limitations of human  lifetimes would suggest. Their growth and death involve cycles that keep the planet habitable. The machinery of these cycles is called erosion: the weathering of rock and its transport to the sea. Once there, it is subducted into the mantle, where volcanoes return the silicates, sulfates, water, carbon dioxide, and oxygen to the surface.<br/><br/>Almost every step of the erosion process is catalyzed by water. For instance, in your turn you may weather rock using crystallization (busting rock by growing evaporated salt crystals), then transport the remains to the River using creep (movement propelled by wet/dry and freeze/thaw cycles). Once plunked in the River, the eroded material is moved as sediment to the sea. Braided rivers carry the maximum sediment load, but they are the least stable (and the trickiest to play).<br/><br/>The role of erosion in atmosphere control is often overlooked. Every mountain is a titanic terraformer and greenhouse gas scrubber. Weathering removes 100 billion tons of oxygen and 800 billion tons of carbon dioxide from the air each year. Although the biological functions of respiration and decay contribute more to the atmosphere than erosion, during many past episodes it was the other way around. Left unchecked, a major orogenic (mountain-building) event removes so much CO2 that the oceans would freeze over in less than an Erosion game turn (6 million years, the same scale as for the game American Megafauna). On the other hand, a major flood volcano such as the Deccan Traps has poured hundreds of trillions of tons of CO2 back into the air,  dwarfing the outputs of all human industry combined.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The everlasting conflict between eternal enemies spread to yet another world! Huge planar gates are opening and hordes of powerful creatures are pouring into the land to fight the final battle for dominance. There can be only one winner!<br/><br/>Ostium is a turn-based, deck building card game. Each player uses their planar gates to summon creatures that fight to destroy the gates controlled by other players. The creatures use their abilities and fight. Each creature has its own set of abilities, which grow more powerful, if the creature is supported by other creatures from its clan. The creatures can also fuse with energy channeled directly from a planar gate to deal crushing damage to the opponent&rsquo;s gates or creatures.<br/><br/>Each turn has two phases. In the first phase, the player can bring more forces to the battlefield and use special abilities of the summoned creatures. The second phase is combat, where all the extra powers, channeled energy, and clan synergies lay waste to the enemy forces.<br/><br/>The player can summon creatures directly to the battlefield (and place them in attack or defense rows) or the discard pile. The order in which the cards are placed in the deck, drawn, and played can decide the outcome of the game, since neither the deck, nor the discard pile are shuffled. The way the creatures are placed on the battlefield also greatly affects their abilities and power.<br/><br/>Ostium was initially designed as a duel game, but you will also find solo mode and 3 player match rules described in the official game rule book. A typical game usually takes 30 to 45 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players take turns laying a domino on the table, with each placed domino after the first lying adjacent to at least one side of a tile or on top of two tiles.<br/><br/>Once everyone has only one domino in hand, players reveal that tile and score points for the round. For each type of animal on your tile, you find the largest orthogonally-connected group of that animal, then score 1 point for each animal in the group. If you have the same animal on both halves of your last tile, you score that animal twice. If you have a type of animal on your tile that no one else has, double the score for that animal.<br/><br/>After scoring, return the revealed tile to hand, then draw more tiles to fill your hand once again. After a certain number of rounds, whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Can you lead the goats to the highest parts of the mountains?<br/><br/>In Goat 'n' Goat, a.k.a. やぎ山, you want to combine your goats to conquer the tallest mountains possible, but goats only like to line up in certain ways. The game includes goat cards in three colors, with numbers ranging from 1-5 and with more low numbers than high; the game also includes mountain cards in three colors, with the values ranging from 3-9.<br/><br/>Players start with 3-5 cards in hand, and six cards are laid face up on the table. On a turn, you play one or more cards from your hand that all have the same number, whether of one color or more. If you don't have cards of this color or all the cards of this color are equal to or less than the number played, then you add these new cards to the stacks in front of you, with each color going into its own stack; if the number played is lower than the top card in a color stack, then you place all previously played cards of this color in front of you face down as penalty points, then start a new stack of this color with the cards just played.<br/><br/>You then choose as many cards from the row of six as the value of the card(s) just played. The quantity of cards played doesn't matter &mdash; only the digit on those cards! Whether you play a single 1 or five 1s, you draw only one card. If you now have more than eight cards in hand, you must discard down to eight cards, keeping all discarded cards as penalty points.<br/><br/>On a turn, after playing cards, you can choose to discard cards of a color to collect a mountain card in the same color that has a same or lower value. Thus, to collect a 4 blue mountain, you must discard four or more blue goat cards that you've collected in front of you.<br/><br/>Once you've gone through the deck twice (with 3-5 players) or once (with two players), the game ends. You tally all mountain points you've collected, then lose 1 point for each penalty card in front of you. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

You are not the only Duke in this land, though, and you are not the only one with this fantastic ambition.<br/><br/>There are many ways to build your castle. You can even build it to lean towards one of several different styles, be it for Defence, for Comfort or even for Offence!<br/><br/>The occasional royalty may pop by your land and if your castle does not suit his or her taste, they will leave to find better accommodations with your rival dukes! On top of that, the deadly dragon will appear once in awhile and raze the lands. If your castle is not well fortified against dragon attacks, it might just crumble! Score Victory Points (VP) by having the most number of important folks residing in your castle, as well as have the most magnificent castle of all and take home the title of Grand Duke! Castle Dukes is a very visually appealing game of Dexterity and Strategy - And it's 3D to boot!<br/><br/>Each round, players start with 5 Coins. 6 Room cards are revealed from the stack and placed in positions 1 through 6 (from bottom to top), each room costing a higher amount of Coins to acquire than the last. The player with the First Player token gets first rights to the Room cards, passing the turn in clockwise direction until all players have had their chance to acquire rooms with their Coins. Rooms acquired leave a gap on their position and are not replaced with new cards during any player's turn. At the end of the whole turn after every player has had a chance at the rooms, any remaining room cards are then moved downwards to fill any gaps. Draw more Room cards from the Room Stack to fill all positions as needed. It is possible to choose not to acquire any Room card during a player's turn. Note: In the various positions 1 through 6, players also acquire additional castle components such as Tables and Coffers along with the Room cards, as depicted on the position on the main game board.<br/><br/>Once done, all players then simultaneously acquire pillars, Floor Tiles, and Construction cards using their remaining Coins. They may then immediately build the newly acquired components, adding on layers to their castles until they gradually become beautiful fortresses of various shapes and heights. When all players are done with this next phase, a Guest card is revealed to show which Guests have dropped by for that turn. The princess always goes for the most comfortable castle, even if its flimsy. The king's life is very precious and he always seeks out the most defended castle. The knight looks for glory and always goes for the castle that best gives him the chance to slay a dragon. This is the end of a turn in Castle Dukes. The First Player token is now passed on to the right, and a new turn begins with each player having 5 Coins again. And yes, a dragon might appear now and then to attack all castles! Depending on your level of Defence or Offence, each castle will take varying amounts of damage.<br/><br/>Beware! This is also a dexterity game! If at any point in the game your castle collapses, be it a small portion or even just one tiny component falling off, you will take a Crumble token which at the end of the game reduces your Victory Points by 2!<br/><br/>",

Each mythology includes two pantheons (cards that define your game strategy) + cards for the gods deck (which includes characters, events and resources) + cards for the designs deck (actions, equipment and summonings).<br/><br/>Each player in Myths at War needs to build his own deck of at least 51 cards (1 pantheon / 20 gods / 30 designs) of his choice, and each expansion  increases the diversity of characters, actions and strategies you can use in order to achieve victory but all expansions can be played on his own.<br/><br/>During the game, each player has to bring into play the cards his oracles offer him and play actions from the designs deck both in the influence phase (where the gods plan from their pantheon) and in the confrontation phase (where the characters who decide to go to battle fight to decrease the opponent&rsquo;s power) to obtain supremacy or consign the opponent to oblivion.<br/><br/>",

If an opponent's marble is pushed off the board, you score it; score enough points, and you win.<br/><br/>Now Abalone Offboard puts a spin on the sumo-ish feel of Abalone by introducing external scoring zones to the game board.

This favors the Germans, provided that the Russians do not bring too much armor against them at once.<br/><br/>The other key feature are the reserve rules, which allow a player to both react to the opponent's attacks and to exploit holes punched by his units.  Airpower can be used to interdict reserves - and doing so can be important to winning the game.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day <br/>Hex: 1.2 miles / 2 kilometers <br/>Units: Regiment to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>Two dual-side printed countersheets (360 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Ring of Fire rulebook<br/>Two dual-side printed CRT/TEC Player Aid charts<br/>Two single-side printed Player Aid cards<br/>One 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Very High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-10 hours<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Guadalajara, portrays the operations launched by the Italian CTV (Corpo Truppe Volontarie&mdash;Corps of Volunteer Troops) towards Guadalajara with the ultimate objective of taking Madrid and putting a rapid end to the Spanish Civil War. The unexpected and dogged resistance of the Republican Army, which was fully involved in a deep reorganization, caused the failure of this offensive, forcing the Nationalists to give up trying to storm the capital and making them take the long road by capturing the whole country before being able to declare themselves victorious.<br/><br/>After the failure of Franco's Nationalist troops to surround and conquer Madrid during the first months of the Spanish Civil War, Spain looked doomed to a long war of attrition.  During this gloomy period, a new force made its appearance -- the motorized Italian Corpo Truppe Volontarie (CTV).  Lavishly equipped and overconfident after its first successful performance in the fall of Malaga, the Italians thought they could quickly and easily end the war.  Spain was not Abyssinia, however, and Madrid was not Malaga.  The new People's Republican Army was no longer the rag-tag mix of militia units that had fought the Nationalists only a few months before.  The Italians were repulsed after a fierce campaign fought under very tough conditions.  Madrid was once again saved for the Republicans, and two more years of war would ensue.<br/><br/>Special rules regarding tanks, anti-tank defenses, flamethrowers, truck transports, traffic jams, morale, and panic will allow you to recreate the Italian offensive.  Will you succeed where your historical counterparts failed?  Will you break the Republican lines?  Will your volunteers panic as they did in 1937?  Prepare to fight what Ernest Hemingway considered one of the most decisive battles in military history.<br/><br/>Four scenarios cover the full campaign, the Italian offensive, the Nationalist &quot;side-offensive&quot;, and the Republican counteroffensive which broke the spine of the Italian assault.<br/><br/>Guadalajara is the twelfth game in the Standard Combat Series (SCS) from series from Multi-Man Publishing.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1-2 days<br/>Hex: .6 mile / 1 kilometers<br/>Units: Company to Battalion<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 32&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page Standard Combat Series rules booklet, Version 1.7<br/>One 16-page Guadalajara rules booklet<br/>One Player Aid card<br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-Low<br/>Players: 2-3 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-8<br/><br/>",

You are a collector of pots and plates during the Edo period of Japan.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, each player receives 5 ryo (an old Japanese currency unit) and the game board is filled with &quot;wanted objects&quot;. New objects are placed at particular price values, while objects already on the board are boosted one step on the price chart because they're still in demand. In player order, based on the number cards they hold, each player chooses a deck of object cards, which represents a particular location of Japan. Everyone goes through their decks at the same time, pulling out any items that they'd like to buy and that they can afford to purchase. At any time, a player can stop looking and grab the lowest available number card.<br/><br/>Once everyone has bought their wares, they sell them in number order from low to high, selling as many items as they wish for the current prices on offer and holding on to whatever else they've purchased. Each time an item is sold, the appropriate wanted card on the game board drops one level in value, falling off the board if demand is fulfilled. If you end up trying to sell at the wrong time, some of your collection will be worthless! If a player has 50 or more ryo, the player with the most ryo wins; if not, a new round begins with players taking the decks of object cards, searching once again for goods in demand...<br/><br/>",

In desperate house-to-house fighting the two sides fought, bleed, and froze in the chilling Russian winter.<br/><br/>The Battle For Stalingrad puts you in the rubble-strewn streets as the German forces fight through one block of the city after another. The only hope for both sides is to secure the city before they run out of blood and food.<br/><br/>As the game unfolds, you'll see one section of the city after another ground into rubble by your ceaseless fighting. As the city deteriorates, the amount of supplies generated for your men decreases. Supplies are the lifeblood of your army. Without them, you cannot move or attack, and you'll suffer higher casualties in combat.<br/><br/>In the end, you'll be scrambling through the ruins, as much in search of food as the enemy.<br/><br/>",

The first player whose family tree includes all of the heroic traits necessary for them to complete the saga they're describing wins the game.<br/><br/>During set-up, each player is dealt a random saga card; these are placed face-up in the middle of the table. Six inheritance markers of the appropriate colors are placed upon the colored icons on the saga card. Each player draws a starting hand of four hero cards. Play proceeds clockwise. Each turn consists of the following phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Catch Your Breath: Draw up to a hand of four cards. <br/>    Embellish Your Story: Optionally use an embellishment for which you meet the qualifications, based on the color of your youngest hero (if one is in play).<br/>    Continue the Tale: Play a card from your hand onto your family tree.<br/><br/><br/>Each family tree consists of seven spots and represents the player's heroic lineage. Each hero card possesses a dominant and (in most cases) recessive trait. Traits which match those required by the player's saga may have inheritance markers placed upon them. Once all the player's inheritance markers have been placed on their family tree, they win.<br/><br/>The player's family tree also allows them to use embellishments matching the color of their youngest hero. If second or third generation heroes of the same color are present, more powerful embellishments may be used.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Adventure awaits in Anchors Aweigh!, but have you packed the right equipment to prepare for what lies ahead?<br/><br/>The game lasts two rounds, with two phases in each round. To set up, give everyone a ship that has room for twelve items (four under the deck out of view of others), then dump all of the equipment tiles in the center of the table. Take thirteen adventure cards in the appropriate number of the appropriate types (discovery, trade, pirates, contract), then lay them out in a circle around the equipment.<br/><br/>When everyone is ready, reveal the adventure cards, then race to fill your ship with equipment tiles using only one hand, adding two colored goods in the special slots for those. Whoever finishes first scoops the cards up so that everyone else has to finish equipping their ship without seeing what's coming. You then shuffle the cards, then reveal them one by one:<br/><br/><br/>    Discovery: When this type of card is revealed, you can discard the 1 or 2 equipment tiles shown to receive the goods or money instead. Whenever you receive goods, they must be placed in an empty space on your ship; you can discard equipment to make room for them, if you wish.<br/>    Trade: You can trade the one good on the left of the card for the 2-3 goods on the right, if you wish.<br/>    Pirates: Before revealing this card, every player must say either fight or flee. If you flee, nothing happens to you. If you fight, you must be able to discard the equipment shown on the card or else you're penalized and must ditch some money and aa good; if you do have the equipment to drive the pirates away, you receive the reward shown on the card.<br/>    Contract: Place this on the bottom of the deck until only contract cards remain, then reveal them one by one. If you have the 1-4 goods showing on the card, you can discard them to get the monetary reward.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of the round, convert every remaining good into 1 coin, then for each ten coins, convert them into a treasure chest and place it on an empty space in your boat. Now you'll have less room on board for the second leg of this trip, which plays out nearly identically to the first one.<br/><br/>In the end, whoever has the most money wins!<br/><br/>",

The players must cooperate as they face the challenges of their world, including the formidable shadows that are the minions of Darkness. Eventually, they must choose the bravest among them to enter the mouth of Darkness and rescue the sun.<br/><br/>Each round of the game (known as a &quot;day&quot;) is divided into three phases: the Dawn phase, the Challenge phase, and the Dusk phase. In the Dawn phase, each player uses their actions to move about, purify corruption, scout challenges, and share items. In the Challenge phase, each player undertakes a challenge. If they succeed, they gain rewards; if they fail, they incur penalties. In the Dusk phase, game upkeep is performed.<br/><br/>In order to win the game, the players must choose one warrior to enter Darkness as their champion. While the champion battles inside Darkness and attempts to reach the swallowed sun, the other warriors must still defend Tallil from the encroaching shadows, lest they corrupt the world and plunge everything into eternal night. If Darkness finishes swallowing the sun, or the shadows gain too much influence in the world, then the players lose the game.<br/><br/>",

Powered by Lucca comics &amp; Games and dV Giochi, the contest aims to identify the best new card game design from all prototypes received and to reward it by publishing the game in a fully professional and high-quality format, overseen directly by dV Giochi. All prototypes submitted must conform to the technical and style requirements, fixed components and a given theme which changes every year. Everybody can join the contest and this is a great opportunity for emerging game designers to see their idea published. The theme of the award was &ldquo;Cities and Walls;&rdquo; Lucca Citt&agrave; won, and daVinci is proud to introduce it to the public.<br/><br/>It features a deck of 110 cards, divided in 96 Palace parts, 4 towers, 5 Coat of Arms, and 5 Quarters. Each player belongs to a Quarter and tries to increase his family&rsquo;s fame by building palaces and walls and by giving parties in the completed palaces.<br/><br/>During his turn, the player chooses a triplet of cards from the table and uses them to build his buildings; resources and time are very limited, and you need careful planning and master play in order not to have at the end of the game too many unfinished palaces, have lots of parties and... be the winner!<br/><br/>",

The red dragon has taken away the golden Sacred Cheese, the symbol of the kingdom's prosperity and unity, and the fate of the kingdom is now in peril. The brave young heroes of Mythe must now set out on a desperate journey to the dragon's castle and recover the Sacred Cheese!<br/><br/>The players in Mythe, as mice heroes, must travel to the castle of the red dragon, where one of them has to defeat the evil creature and recover the Sacred Cheese. The player who does this wins the game! To progress on their journey, players must draw cards from other players' hands, one by one. When a player has decided that they have taken enough cards, they can decide to advance their hero on the game board. However, if a player draws a Obstacle card, then the hero must stop and deal with the mishap, not moving on that turn.<br/><br/>When a player finishes their turn (whether they advanced or not), they may then redistribute any of their cards to the other players. To win the game, a hero must have one of the legendary cards &mdash; Shield, Sword, or Fairy &mdash; then move onto the Dragon's space to defeat him and save the Sacred Cheese.<br/><br/>In the original release &mdash; named マイス, which is Japanese for &quot;mice&quot; &mdash; the mice heroes were trying to save a princess from the dragon.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "American Carrom, attributed to American Sunday school teacher Henry Haskell, is a derivative of Carrom.  American Carrom differs from Carrom in the board construction, particularly the larger size of the pockets and the striker (shooter) being the same size as the other pieces. American Carrom can also be played with a cue, and the board is patterned with checkers, chess or other board motifs, allowing a variety of other games to be played.  Many American Carrom boards also double as Crokinole boards.<br/><br/>In American Carrom the object is to flick to strike the Carrom men into the pockets in a similar fashion to pool or billiards.  Sometimes a cue is used rather than flicking.  Due to the larger pocket size American Carrom lacks some of the strategy and skill required of the 'proper' version of the game.<br/><br/>Also noteworthy is the fact that American Carrom uses rings for game pieces whereas Carrom game pieces are solid discs.<br/><br/>European games in a similar vein: Korona and H-ring spel.<br/><br/>",

The Union Army of the Tennessee is beginning to stir beneath the shadow of a small frontier church in western Tennessee.  The troops of U.S. &quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; Grant wait only for their junction with Buell's Army of the Ohio to begin their long planned advance into the heartland of the Confederacy.<br/><br/>Then suddenly the spring morning is shattered by the rattle of gunfire and the piercing rebel yell of over 40,000 charging Confederate soldiers.  The battle is joined and the fate of the west hangs in the balance.  Can you as General A. S. Johnston drive the Union invaders from Southern soil?  Can you as U.S. Grant rally your forces and halt the rebel onslaught?  You'll never know until you've played Fury in the West'.<br/><br/>Fury in the West is a realistic wargame played on an attractive five color 22 by 28 inch Mapboard with over 230 colorful extra-thick die-cut counters that accurately represent the opposing armies.  This game enables you to refight and study one of the least understood battles of the American Civil War.<br/><br/>Fury in the West is one of the most accurate wargames of its kind.  Each detail has been pain-stakingly researched in order to achieve strict historical accuracy.  The system has been extensively playtested to ensure a fast moving, delicately balanced and exciting game.<br/><br/>Rules cover such important facts as leadership, bayonet charges, gun boats, long range artillery, formations and facing and many more.  An innovative yet simple system enables players to record casualties and stragglers of their individual units.<br/><br/>Counters:<br/>Battleline edition = 255 (10 of which are blanks)<br/>Avalon Hill edition = 234 (none of which are blanks)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To celebrate the twentieth anniversary of Bohnanza, designer Uwe Rosenberg and publisher AMIGO Spiel have released a special edition of the game appropriately titled Bohnanza: 20 Jahre.<br/><br/>The rules for play are the same as those of Bohnanza: Players start with a hand of bean cards, and they cannot change the order of cards in their hand! Each bean card has a number that indicates how many cards of that type are in the deck, as well as a &quot;beanometer&quot; on the bottom of the card that tells you how many Talers you earn when you harvest those beans from your field. The more beans of a type that you have, the more Talers you earn.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must plant the first card in hand into one of their fields, and they may plant the second card. All cards in a field must be of the same type. The player then reveals two cards from the deck and optionally trades those cards and cards in their hand with cards in the hands of other players; all traded cards must be planted, not returned to hand. Players can trade cards from anywhere in their hand, and doing so lets you set up good plays in future turns. To end a turn, a player draws cards and places them at the back of their hand. You can harvest a field at any time to collect Talers, keeping some cards to represent these coins and returning others to the discard pile to be recycled when the deck is shuffled.<br/><br/>Bohnanza: 20 Jahre adds one new type of bean to the game: the spring bean. Whenever a player harvests two spring beans, they draw cards from the deck equal to one more than the number of players. They plant one of these cards for themselves, then pass the cards around the table so that each other player can do the same. The final card is returned to the active player, who keeps it for a Taler.<br/><br/>",

This allows for the mixture of aerial and surface combat that characterized the Pacific theater of operations.  Players must write orders and assign missions to tasks forces prior to movement, then conduct aerial searches for enemy fleets and submarines.  Frequently, forces will clash in surface battles, and players track damage, hit by hit, reducing ship capabilities and inflicting casualties.<br/><br/>SOPAC includes 20 scenarios -- 10 Battle and 10 Operational -- allowing players to explore the early days of combat and try some what-if situations that history never explored.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Aye, Dark Overlord! is a fantasy party game filled with humor that's fast to play and easy to learn.<br/><br/>Each player is an evil goblin servant of the evil Dark Overlord &mdash; Rigor Mortis, the Master of all Evils &mdash; and all of them are gathered at the Dark Overlord's knees to explain why they brought that last important mission, ordered by &quot;His Evil Excellence&quot; himself, to failure again. Panic wraps you in its freezing grip; what can you do to save your poor skin? Could you say you are not the one to blame, but your inept companions? Yes, of course, that's the solution! There is only one little problem: They've probably got exactly the same idea...and the Dark Overlord is not known for his mercy...<br/><br/>This roleplaying game is all about telling lies and shifting the blame on your poor fellow ones, so the righteous wrath of your Master can give them what they deserve!<br/><br/>Aye, Dark Overlord! The Green Box is a new version of Aye, Dark Overlord! that is playable on its own while also capable of being combined with the original game. The Green Box adds entirely new mechanisms to the game, including the Back of the Line and No Way! Action cards. Occult Hunters, The Best from the Labyrinth, The Jar with a Thousand Demons, and Impossible Math Calculations are just a few of the new hints in The Green Box, giving you more stories to shield yourself from the Dark Overlord's wrath.<br/><br/>",

Since every Player controls Romans as well as Barbarians you will get all kinds of situations like Romans vs. Barbarians, Romans fighting among themselves, or Barbarians fighting other Barbarians.<br/>The Emperor for each Roman Faction changes every Game Turn as well as the Barbarian Peoples that the Players control.<br/>With its easy to learn rules - players who are familiar with &quot;Hispania&quot;, &quot;Britannia&quot; or &quot;History of the World&quot; will find some similarities and some new features - and the constantly changing Barbarians, &quot;The History of the Roman Empire&quot; can be great fun.<br/><br/>The Players will have to decide how to use their Roman Legions as well as how to use the armies of their Barbarians and of course where to plan new Cities and Forts (for the Roman Factions).<br/>Since it is worth many more Victory Points to control all areas of one color, soon everyone will try to establish his own small empire (and of course to disturb the others), until the more powerful Barbarians like the Goths or the Huns arrive and threaten to take control of the map.<br/><br/>Each turn the Roman Factions spend some of their Victory Points on new Legions and/or Forts or Fortresses. The Barbarians do not use their Victory Points for recruiting Units but rather &quot;mobilize&quot; up to a certain number of Armies (how many units depends on the Barbarian People).<br/>Every game will present you with new situations since the Players will work on and change their strategies and the 45 random cards will influence every game in a unique way.<br/>At the end of the seventh turn, the players total their victory points and determine the winner.<br/><br/>Will the Roman Empire rise to Glory or will it be crushed by the overwhelming Barbarians?<br/><br/>It's up to YOU&hellip;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Easter Island is a tiny triangular speck of land at the eastern edge of Polynesia in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The island has fascinated travelers, mystics, and scientists for years as people have wondered how such a small, isolated area could have been home to a society that created the world's most spectacular outdoor museum. In the 1940s, Norwegian archeologist Thor Heyerdahl sailed the reed boat Kon-Tiki from South America to Easter Island to show that the technology available made it possible for Polynesia to be settled from the Americas. In the 1970s, Erich Van Daniken popularized the idea that the world was visited by ancient astronauts and the beautiful and enormous stone statutes, the Moai, of Easter Island were used as some of his &quot;evidence.&quot;<br/><br/>Today, scientists around the world generally agree that Easter Island was settled from other Polynesian islands to its west, and the extreme culture that produced hundreds of stone Moai is related to other cultures in the region. The history of the island is a history of constraint, and the carving of the Moai, the rapid deforestation of the island, and the limited food sources available all worked together to build an extreme culture that became the victim of its own consumption. In this way, Easter Island today represents more than just a wonderful place to travel, but also is a reminder of the greater resource limits of our entire planet. As populations continue to grow and we put further strains on sources of fuel and food, are we heading toward the same fate that this small island suffered hundreds of years ago? The island today is owned by Chile, and the small population thrives with a few weekly flights to mainland South America and the occasional cargo ship visit.<br/><br/>Moai is a game that closely follows the developments and excesses of the island until the arrival of Dutch Admiral Jacob Roggeveen, the first European to discover the island and name it for the day of his discovery. Combining many of the historical features of the island's culture in an exciting and well-playing strategic game, players can have fun reliving the dramatic history of this exciting little island.<br/><br/>",

Each band has a chief chosen from the twenty available, each with its own unique abilities and characteristics.<br/><br/>The management of each seven-card deck is fundamental, with players using cards to collect resources, place bandits to guard a region, attack the Volantes, assault the prison of the city of Recife, convert accumulated resources into fame, train their leader, and recruit new members for the gang.<br/><br/>You win by accumulating fame points, which are obtained by attacking the Volantes, but also by training your boss to solve his life goal and help him retire in glory. You also gain fame points in several other ways, and whoever collects the most fame wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This is the Christmas themed edition of our wildly popular hand-slapping party game, Taco Cat Goat Cheese Pizza!<br/><br/>The premise of these games is simple - say the next word in the pattern (in this version, &quot;Santa, cookie, elf, candy, snowman&quot;) and at the same time flip a card from your personal deck. If it matches the pattern word you said then everyone slaps the card pile. Whoever is last takes the pile and adds it to their personal deck. Similarly, special cards require everyone do a specific action and then not be the last to slap the deck afterwards. The game ends when one player successfully plays all the cards in their personal deck.<br/><br/>This festive game includes new cards and special actions to add to your game night merriment. It's fast, fun &amp; friendly...the Dolphin Hat way!<br/><br/>",

Each turn player receive a varying number of activations to represent the supply levels, command confusion, fatigue and intelligence of their armies and this leads to an ebb and flow to the battle as each side is dominant at different times.

The five locations are numbered 2 to 6, and at the end of each round battle happens at only one or two of these locations. Each unit that is in a battle location contributes its strength multiplied by the value of the location, and the sum of the contributions from all of a player's units is their strategy rating for the round. However, each player only knows one of the two battle locations, while their opponent knows the other battle location!<br/><br/>The player with the higher strategy rating wins the round and one victory point. The other player not only loses the round, but also loses an amount of morale indicated on the units they deployed to the board &mdash; so be careful about playing too many units as they will cost you morale if you lose the round!<br/><br/>If a player runs out of morale, the game ends immediately and the other player wins. If at the end of seven rounds, no player has ran out of morale, the player with the most victory points wins. In case of a tie (made possible by some special abilities), the player who won the final victory point (in the final round) wins.<br/><br/>",

Miniatures combat itself is asymmetric, as the LEGION player runs an entire army of diverse and fearsome robots, dark matter powers, giant golems, and doomsday devices, while the MAYHEM player gets to build a team of three elite specialized agents, and give them unique upgrades to build on their individual strengths and shared synergies.<br/><br/>The game features a procedural campaign, which has the MAYHEM player keeping their agents' progress and upgrades through a series of missions, while the LEGION player deploys more fearsome and dangerous squads of troopers. Choices made, victories and defeats, and buildings and blocks damaged and destroyed in combat will affect later missions and ensure that every campaign plays out differently.<br/><br/>",

By constructing roads and structures, expanding the population, and mining precious resources, players compete to create the most magnificent settlement. Be cautious, though, as lurking marauders can strike your village at any unpredictable moment!<br/><br/>The game lasts for twelve rounds. At the start of each round, one of the players rolls four dice and then assigns them to specific sections on a special Dice Sheet with symbols. If any sword symbols are rolled (representing marauder attacks), all players mark them on their sheet. If players don't recruit knights by the end of the game, these swords will result in negative points.<br/><br/>Afterward, players simultaneously and independently choose one die each, and after placing their pawn next to it, they use the resources indicated by the die on their Village Sheet. Each die can be chosen by any number of players.<br/>Unless the sword symbol is rolled, the die provides two resources, the first from the outer circle and the second from the inner circle on the Dice Sheet.<br/>Throughout the game, players have opportunities to acquire additional resources by constructing buildings, finding resources in the mine, etc.<br/>Every few rounds, special actions are triggered for certain buildings (with red flags).<br/><br/>After twelve rounds, players tally their points, which are earned by building structures, gathering resources in the warehouse and achieving other scoring conditions.<br/><br/>The game will also have a campaign mode and a cow.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>The game will be funded on Kickstarter from October 16th to November 1st, 2023.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Qwinto: Das Kartenspiel is a card game version of the dice game Qwinto. As in the original game, players each have an individual score sheet, and they're trying to use numbers (1-18) to fill in the empty spaces in three rows, which are colored orange, yellow and purple. Within a row, lower numbers must be placed to the left of higher numbers, and no number can be repeated. In the two- and three-space columns formed by the rows, no number can be repeated, but numbers can be in any order.<br/><br/>Aside from the score sheet, the game includes 32 cards, with the cards numbered 0-6 and -2 in four colors (yellow, orange, purple, gray). Each player starts with a random hand of three cards, then four cards are laid in a 2x2 square. On a turn, a player lays a card from their and onto one of the cards in the square, then sums that card and the two adjacent cards, stating this number and the color of all non-grey cards out loud, e.g., &quot;13 in purple and yellow&quot;. Each player can then write a 13 in either the purple or yellow row on their score sheet. If the number is less than 1 or all the cards are grey, then no one can write anything; if the active player can't write anything on their score sheet, then they must mark a penalty box instead.<br/><br/>If a player has two cards with the same number, they can lay down one of them, then the matching number in an adjacent space, thus possibly changing the sum drastically. A player refills their hand to three cards to end their turn.<br/><br/>When a player has completely filled two rows with numbers or all four penalty spaces on their score sheet, the game ends. Each player tallies the points for each of their rows: 1 point per number if spaces are empty, or as many points as the rightmost number if the row is full. For each three-space column, if all spaces are filled, then the player scores points equal to the number in the pentagon. For each penalty point, the player loses 5 points. Whoever has the highest sum wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Imperialism: Road to Domination approximately covers the period from the 15th to the 19th century. The players control superpowers and attempt to transform them into mighty empires. To accomplish this, they will not only have to look after the economic growth and try to gain social and civilization achievements, but also modernize and expand their fleet and land army. Because being at war is expensive, it is often wiser to resort to plots and lies. Sometimes, making empty promises at the negotiating tables is better than getting involved in a risky and exhausting war, which may empty the treasury and expose you to losing precious prestige. The players have to pay extra attention to the dissenters who, especially in the beginning of the game, have greater military power and will not hesitate to draw others into a religious war. Will you manage to create an enormous colonial empire, military European dominion, or a territorially small but economically strong country? The players&rsquo; choices, luck, and reactions of others will affect the struggle. Creating an empire requires good strategic sense and a flexible approach to changing military and economic situations. The players have to forge thoughtful alliances and avoid wars which they may not win.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to create the most powerful empire. To achieve this, the players will change the reigning rulers, brew plots, conspire, conquer minor countries and overseas lands which will increase the level of goods production in their empire. The players will have to expand their armies and fleet to confront other superpowers. The player with the most glory points wins.<br/><br/>",

Once a member of the Triple Alliance with Germany and Austria-Hungary, Italy now sides with the Entente. Italy's dream is of annexing Austro-Hungarian territory inhabited by ethnic Italians. Austria-Hungary views Italy not only as traitorous, but also as its traditional enemy. The stage is set for a bloodbath. The Italian army attempts to cross a narrow path into Austria-Hungary, across the Isonzo River towards Trieste. There the Austro-Hungarian army is dug in and waiting for them.<br/><br/>May 1916 - The Strafexpedition<br/><br/>The Chief of Staff of the Austro Hungarian army, Conrad von Hotzendorff, feels the time is right to punish Italy. He ignores the German chief Falkenhayn who foresees problems on the Eastern Front. Conrad masses guns and men in the Tirol for a strike to cut off the Italian armies to the east along the Isonzo. The plan looks good on paper, but the attacks will take place across rugged country. The Italians in the southern Tirol have neglected their rear area defenses. Italian reinforcements rush to the area. It is a dicey affair, but the Italian lines hold fast. The peril to the Italian forces along the Isonzo is checked.<br/><br/>May 1917 - Tenth Isonzo<br/><br/>Again and again and again, valiant Italian infantry has been fed into the maelstrom of the Isonzo. Each battle differs from the last only by their increasing intensity. The 9th Isonzo battle brought the capture of Gorizia. Now the Italians work to enlarge their holdings on the east of the bloody Isonzo. In the end, each side is once again exhausted. The Italians have become weary of the war. Yet, the Austrians feel that one more attack along the Isonzo may be the one that breaks their army first.<br/>October 1917 - Caporreto<br/>With Russia just about finished, the German army turns to help its beleaguered ally. Crack German divisions are sent to the Italian front to remove the mortal threat to Austria-Hungary. The Austrians reinforce the front with specially trained assault units. The Italians along the headwaters of the Isonzo are overwhelmed. German and Austrian units pour through the mountain gaps and into the Italian rear. Italian units melt away in the rush to get out of the trap. The gains of the Isonzo battles are permanently lost. Enterprising Austrians cross the Tagliamento River. Further Italian retreats ensue. The rout of the Italians ends along the banks of the Piave, the last natural barrier before Venice and the open country of the Po Valley. But Italy is not defeated, and her citizens rally anew to the cause.<br/><br/>June 1918 - Albrecht &amp; Radetzky<br/><br/>The Germans are on the attack in France. Conrad wants in on the glory. Although the soldiers of the once proud Habsburg armies are weak and emaciated, they will have to go on the offensive one more time. As so often before, the Austrians split their strength between Conrad's armies in the Tirol and the forces along the Piave. Conrad's attacks from the north are ineffective. Once again the Marshal has made unrealistic plans his forces cannot execute. In the rugged mountain terrain only a single division manages to make any gains. Initial attacks across the Piave are successful, but quickly bog down. The Austrians have crossed the river, but cannot push far enough forward on the west bank to keep their pontoon bridges out of range of Italian artillery. Unable to advance, and unable to maintain viable supply lines across the river, they cross back, only to await the end.<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/><br/>       560 Die-Cut Counters<br/>       One 34in x 22in Map<br/>       Scenario Rulebook, Charts, and Tables<br/><br/><br/>Scale is 20km / hex<br/>4 days per turn<br/>Unit Sizes: Division / Brigade<br/><br/>(from the publisher's website and user's description)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Creating unique monsters, powerful devices, and fantastic potions is a dangerous business. As you gain power and succeed in your experiments you must also maintain your laboratory to prevent catastrophe. Take on the many challenges of Palm Laboratory anywhere you go with this handheld resource management game.<br/><br/>Designed in the style of its predecessor, Palm Island, Palm Laboratory is a SOLO ONLY game that brings familiar mechanics with a new style of play. Like Palm Island, Palm Laboratory uses a small deck of 4 sided cards and deck transforming mechanics to flip and rotate cards. As you improve each card, each will increase your resource production, gain more points, or help to achieve the goal of your current game.<br/><br/>Each time you play Palm Laboratory you will select a Primary Goal. This defines the rules for victory or defeat. Some goals add additional cards to you to generate new resources or other goal-specific objectives.<br/><br/>Each turn you will review the top two cards of your deck and take an action listed on the top section of either card, or discard the top card by placing it in the back of the deck. When you take a card action you do so by paying any required cost and then following the action type: rotating 180 degrees, flipping it over, or storing the card by rotating it 90 degrees so it sticks out. After manipulating the card during an action you then place it in the back of the deck. Cards that are stored will stick out the side, which provides resources you can use on future actions.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

On a classical game board, terrain symbols on the map and specially designed rules help to represent weapons effects, which are one of the main sources of casualties during urban fightings.<br/><br/>In the same way, the map system allows the management of distant fire, even from building to building, as well as close quarter battle from room to room. When explosives are used to breach walls, or when a shell hits its target, collateral effects of the explosion are taken into account. It was also critical to integrate one of the major players of today&rsquo;s conflicts, which is the civilian population. The presence of non-combatants often complicates the way forces can use their weapons, especially against irregular opponents.<br/><br/>In addition, the presence of tactical leaders is a real asset for assault squads.

It's a hot day in the old magic kitchen where the little magician's apprentices are learning the art of brewing magic potions. They need to put plenty of ingredients in the cauldron for this, then it will be time to make a fire. But will it be that easy? Leg of toad and stumbling curse &ndash; which of you will be the first?<br/><br/>Magician's Kitchen is played on a square board with five objects placed on it: a cauldron in each corner, and a fireplace in the middle. Each player has four magic ingredients (marbles) which have to be delivered to each of the cauldrons. On his turn, a player takes his apprentice &ndash; a big wooden pawn with a bowl on top for holding &quot;ingredients&quot; &ndash; and places it on his starting location on the board. He puts one of his ingredients in the bowl (or two, if another player has already delivered all his ingredients). Then he uses his magic wand to push his apprentice toward a cauldron in order to deliver his ingredient. If the apprentice falls, his turn ends, and he has to try again on his next turn.<br/><br/>A player who has already delivered all of his ingredients must try to light the fire by moving the fireball (another marble) to the fireplace. If he succeeds, he wins.<br/><br/>Magician's Kitchen uses magnets and metal balls hidden under the playing surface (at random locations) to create &quot;stumbling&quot; points which make delivering the marbles more difficult.

        "description": "Westphalia concerns the diplomatic negotiations and military campaigns that brought an end to the Thirty Years War and Eighty Years War. The question isn't a matter of who &quot;wins&quot; the war - that was decided a long time ago. Instead, each player seeks to arrive at a settlement that meets their own political, confessional, and economic goals. These goals are not mutually exclusive: if multiple players meet their victory conditions, they all win. The trick is, if all six players manage to meet their goals, then the game goes to a scoring round, and only one player wins.<br/><br/>The result is a mix of cooperation and competition between six asymmetric factions (Austria, Bavaria, Spain, France, Sweden, and the Dutch Republic). The game unfolds in alternating Diplomacy Phases, in which anything and everything is up for negotiation, and Military Phases, in which tense cat-and-mouse chases give players the leverage they need in talks.<br/><br/>There is no money in the game, only Debt, and you only ever seem to get more of it. At the end of the game, your Debt is reduced according to your accomplishments, and the remaining Debt is compared to faction-specific benchmarks to check for victory. Additionally, two factions must each ensure that two other specific factions meet their goals in order to meet their own: Austria must ensure victory for Bavaria and Spain, while France must do the same for Sweden and the Dutch Republic. This isn't mutual, however; once Bavaria gets what it wants, for example, it can hang Austria out to dry.<br/><br/>This is a game for exactly six players: no more, no less. It cannot and does not scale to suit other player counts.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The gameplay remains mostly the same as you play the role of a great God or a team of Gods, defending your reign from rival Gods by using the warriors and disciples loyal to you. However, in this version each player chooses to be a God of Egyptian or Babylonian Mythology and uses that God to take control of the cosmos.<br/><br/>When playing with 2 to 6 players, you win by reducing all of the other Gods to 0 energy or by reaching 25 energy. When in a Team Match, you play with 4 or 6 players teamed up in pairs of two. You will have one Main God and a Support God. A team wins together if they can eliminate the opposing team&rsquo;s Main God.<br/><br/>River of Souls also includes six temple cards, your Gods place of worship. Temples provide the Gods, through a High Priest, Energy when they need it. They can be attacked instead of the opponent&rsquo;s God and their Energy is reduced as in a normal attack. A Temple with 0 Energy is destroyed and turned face down.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War&quot; is a tactical combat wargame of the first battle of Bull Run.<br/><br/>The game is played on a map of the area over which the battle was fought overlaid with a hexagonal grid. Units are infantry, cavalry, and artillery, with brigade, division, and army leaders. Each turn is 30 minutes, and each hex represents 1000 ft. Units are basically regiments and batteries. Some infantry regiments with their brigade leader are capable of forming brigades, increasing offensive power at the expense of movement. Batteries can be limbered for increased movement at the expense of firepower, or unlimbered with full firepower and limited movement.<br/><br/>Combat is a modified version of the classic system adopted by the earlier Avalon Hill games.  However, rules for leader command activation, infantry screening of artillery, and infantry forming brigades to prevent soak-off attacks, ranged artillery, rally of losses are give the game a unique flavour.<br/><br/>The major terrain obstacle is Bull Run which provides the Confederate with defensive advantages and hinders Union movement. <br/> The game begins with the Union troops approaching partially hidden, unsuspecting Confederate forces.  As the Union attack develops, additional Confederate leaders and combat units are activated and are rushed to stem the Union advance.  The Union player wins if he is able to capture any of three objective hexes by the end of the game or takes Manassas at any time.  The Confederate player wins if he takes Centreville at any time or prevents the Union player from holding any of objective hexes at the game end.<br/><br/>The game consists of a 32&quot; by 22&quot; mapboard, 260 counters, various charts, a 12 page rulebook and 1 die.<br/><br/><br/>Magazine References:<br/><br/>The GENERAL Index  Article List:<br/><br/><br/>    The GENERAL Vol.20,No.5<br/>        Series Replay - Bull Run: The First Major Battle of the American Civil War, Rex A.

It is a point-to-point movement game, in which your goal is to collect stars.<br/><br/>You move your plane by playing one of the fox cards in your hand, and every player starts with the same set of cards (eight cards numbered 1-5, with duplicates of 2, 3 and 4). Whoever is farthest back on the path to the Little Prince's planet is the active player, and this player plays one card from hand, moving at least one cloud and up to the number of clouds shown on the card. If you land on a star cloud, you take a star from the reserve; if you land on a telescope cloud, you flip one of the tokens at Grandfather's house to see what happens; if you land on a bird cloud, you take one card from Grandfather's deck, which provide different types of movement. If you arrive on a cloud where an opponent's plane sits, you take a card at random from that opponent's hand and give him in return a card of your choice.<br/><br/>When you cross one of the three connecting boards, you take one of the story tiles next to it, with these tiles holding 1-5 stars. Collect both the fox and Little Prince, and you earn eight stars for this pair instead of only two.<br/><br/>If you manage to make it all the way to the Little Prince's planet &mdash; and you'll need to pick up extra movement cards in order to do so &mdash; you receive a star-filled paper plane, with the quickest players receiving the most stars.

It takes place in the Mistfall universe, allowing players to once again take on the roles of iconic Heroes of both Mistfall and Heart of the Mists. Move, plot and fight competitively, cooperatively or solitaire, in a fast and furious mini dungeon crawler of epic proportions!<br/><br/>Each game is played on a five-by-five grid of dungeon room cards, randomized before every game. Players start by choosing their Heroes and placing their tokens in the corner rooms of the dungeon. Each Hero comes with their own set of four double-sided Action Cards placed on the table in front of the player.<br/><br/>During your turn, you will use two of those cards, performing Actions like attacking monsters (but not other Heroes), searching through rooms, moving or preparing for the next rounds. After using an Action Card, you will flip it to the other side, featuring a different Action.<br/><br/>Each Action can be boosted by using the Boon effects from any number of Fate Cards from your hand. Fate Cards are drawn from a common Fate Deck at different points of the game (usually when using the Prepare Action). But Fate Cards can also be used for their alternative Bane effect, which allows you to move monsters, make unexpected changes to the layout of the labyrinth, or snatch treasures from other players.<br/><br/>Each turn will end with the active player drawing one Fate Card for its third and final effect: monster spawn and movement. This is also the time when most monsters will be able to attack the Heroes, dealing damage some of which can be easily soaked, while other have to be placed on their Action Cards, making them unavailable until the Hero is healed.<br/><br/>",

If three of your QUIRKS become extinct, you've lost the game.<br/><br/>In Quirks, players build unusual plants, herbivores, and carnivores by combining cards that show one of three segments of that plant or creature.

Players attempt to create the dominant species of Plant, Herbivore, and Carnivore in the current niche for that turn's climate type -- Ocean, Forest, Plains, Desert and Jungle.<br/><br/>Included are rules for solitaire play, but otherwise Quirks is good for 2-4 players using the standard game.  There are also simplified rules for Quirklings, a streamlined version of the game designed for children of ages 7-11, which can handle 2-6 players.<br/><br/>",

And you still wanted to draw Buckingham Palace in the left corner ... Now it's up to your left neighbor to save you both.

        "description": "(from Compass Games website):<br/><br/>Red Storm Over the Reich is a Ted Raicer game covering the epic final campaigns of WWII on the Eastern Front, as the forces of the Soviet Union smashed the German armies defending Poland, East Prussia, and Pomerania, and advanced across the Oder to Berlin. Included in the game are three scenarios.<br/><br/>The first scenario is historical, which finds the German forces out of position. Their armies will likely be shattered on the first turn, but the victory conditions are tough on the Soviets&ndash; they must do at least as well as historically.<br/><br/>Scenario two has the historic forces, but allows the Germans to implement Operation Sleigh-ride, a sane pull-back of the main defense line along the Vistula out of range of the opening Russian barrage (an operation historically nixed by Hitler) that at least allows for a more orderly flight.<br/><br/>Scenario three combines Sleigh-ride with reinforcements from other fronts. It assumes that Hitler has had an incapacitating stroke in late November or early December, and the new Nazi leadership is sufficiently uncertain of its position that it defers in military matters to Guderian. The Ardennes Offensive is cancelled, as are the attempts to relieve Budapest, as well as substantial forces are evacuated from the Courland pocket. This increases German strength on the main eastern front by approximately 50% and doubles German tank strength, which, when combined with Sleigh-ride gives the Germans some serious fighting strength.<br/> Scenarios one and two can be completed in 8-12 hours and scenario three in 12-16 hours, depending on your individual playing style.<br/><br/>Red Storm is the opposite of 1941 East Front Games: The Soviets have assembled a massive force and will rip gaping holes in the German lines through blitzkrieg-style attacks. The German player must somehow piece together a desperate defense only to have it repeatedly blown apart by the enemy. But time is the enemy of both players in this game. The Soviets need to accomplish their victory by the end of the last turn, satisfying the historical timeline, or they lose the game, and the Germans must delay the Soviet assault on Berlin long enough to prevent the Soviet win.<br/><br/>The rules for Red Storm Over the Reich are moderate in complexity but feature enough chrome for both sides to recreate this desperate campaign. Special rules include: the creation of Kampfgruppe divisions (or not), naval evacuations, panzerfausts, Volksturm divisions, Leaders, Soviet Logistical Constraint, Hitler mandated attacks and more!<br/><br/>Included with each game are two maps each 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo;, two sheets of counters (456 total), rules, set-up charts, tables, dice and game box.<br/><br/>",

Recruit dragons from the racetrack and fire them up to get them racing. The key to your success lies in supplying your racing team with a stream of support from other dragons on the racetrack. In the end only the fastest racer will be victorious!<br/><br/>Dragon Racer is a fast-paced card drafting strategy game that combines card drafting and set collection. Compete for cards to fire up your team of dragons and advance along the racetrack. After seven turns, the player who has gone the farthest wins! You can combine two copies of Dragon Racer to play with up to eight players.<br/><br/>In more detail, each player gets three random level 1 dragon cards and places them face up next to their character to create their racing team. Shuffle the other level 1 and level 2 dragons to create the starting dragon deck. Remove one random upper track tile and one random lower track tile, then place the six remaining upper/lower track tiles colored-side down between the corner tiles.<br/><br/>On each turn, reveal the next face-down racetrack tile and add its associated dragons to the dragon deck. Assign trophy cards to players according to their position in the race. (Skip this step on the first turn.) Deal each player a number of dragon cards (two + the turn number) from the dragon deck. Players simultaneously draft these cards face down until all cards are taken.<br/><br/>One at a time, in reverse trophy order (i.e. last place goes first), players take turns racing. During this phase you reveal all of the cards you drafted, then use them to fire up dragons on your racing team or to attack other players. At the end of the phase you may swap one of the dragon cards you collected with a dragon on your racing team. Finally, the players with the most dragons from each racetrack type are awarded an extra boost, moving them even further along the racetrack.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is really a card game disguised in a rather large box. The object of the game is to get your team through the qualifying for the (soccer) World Cup, and hopefully win.<br/><br/>The game has a board which depicts a a bunch of soccer fields - just placeholders for the cards played in the <br/>tournament: from 16 fields for the first elimination round and the 8 fields for the round of 16, up to the one field used for the finals. There is also a deck of cards for each of the teams involved in the game with two sets of numbers printed on the card depicting the number of goals scored and the number of penalties given to that team. Finally there are counters depicting the 32 teams in the tournament.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with five random cards and the team counters are randomly distributed to each of the players (showing which team each player will 'manage'). Each team is rated either as 0, 1, or 2 - this is the 'bonus' number of goals that team will score in each match it plays.<br/><br/>Each player in turn can play a card onto any soccer field. On the preliminary matches (fields), the cards are placed face-up (maximum of 3 cards), on any other field, the card is placed face-down. Once all the fields are full, the matches are resolved with the winner of the match going on to the next. Once the preliminary matches are resolved and the teams determined for the next round, those cards are flipped over and the results determined. This is done all the way to the finals.<br/><br/>A player can determine where his team will end up playing each subsequent match and play cards face-down to try to get his team to win, but if your team is upset early - all those face-down cards that you played are now going to help some other team and not yours.<br/><br/>",

Each player or team starts the game with a set of brackets or tokens (depending on the version of the game), and the first player to rid herself of brackets wins.<br/><br/>On a turn, all players are confronted with a trivia question, say, &quot;When did the first Star Wars arrive in theaters?&quot; Each player then uses one bracket to mark a particular year or series of years on her individual year chart. Once everyone has placed their answers, the questioner reveals the answer and everyone sees whether that year appears in the range they guessed. If so, they remove that bracket from the game; if not, they keep the bracket. No matter how much you might want to hedge your guesses, eventually you'll need to guess a year dead on, so plumb the depths of your memory and take your best shot!<br/><br/>",

Small war parties often acted according to their own will rather than following orders from &ldquo;commanding officers.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game includes two decks of opportunity cards.  Each player starts the game with one card and, while the Indian player can &ldquo;earn&rdquo; one more by actions taken in the game, the American player may use momentum to &ldquo;purchase&rdquo; additional cards throughout the game.<br/><br/>Pre-game Indian Enhancement and limited American intelligence help provide play balance to an outnumbered Indian army.  Optional Indian reinforcements are also available.<br/><br/>Newtown also includes rules for Indian honor, resolve under artillery fire, ferocity and evasion.<br/><br/>In Oriskany, the Indian player&rsquo;s secret pre-game selection of the ambush hex and the American player&rsquo;s turn-by-turn choice for Herkimer&rsquo;s rate of march will have profound effect on the course of play.  Proximity to Ft. Stanwix is not the only thing that must be taken into account.  If the column is ambushed while moving at an accelerated rate the ambushing Indians receive advantages.  On the other hand, if Herkimer approaches cautiously he can better defend against an ambush but risks losing army morale for progressing too slowly with the rescue effort.<br/><br/>Herkimer&rsquo;s Tryon County Militia is made up of special 2-step, 1-strength point units permitting each unit to take a step loss and continue to fight.  This expedient is used to reflect the intensity of the fighting that occurred between the two forces.  Militia at Oriskany fought like veteran line units, giving and asking no quarter, for nearly six straight hours.<br/><br/>Oriskany also includes pre and post-ambush Sequences of Play and rules for laagering and limbering the American supply wagons, looting, detaching American garrison artillery and the possibility of storms.<br/><br/>2 errata counters are included in C3i #27 (2013)<br/><br/>",

As the city's great families did in reality, you must cooperate with your rivals to reap the rewards of shared commercial ventures and the prestige of successful military victories. But your ultimate goal is to surpass all the others in the race for prestige! Zena 1814 is a game in which cooperation and competition always go hand in hand &mdash; but in the end there can be only one winner!<br/><br/>The focus point is that is possible to place influence cubes on cards, including the ones played by opponents. This causes a very strong interaction among players and plenty of choices.<br/><br/>In each round, players can move their pawns through the game areas and play cards from their hand belonging to areas where they have at least a pawn. On each card are spaces that allow others to influence it; the player who played it must influence it, while the others can decide whether to do it or not to obtain the effect of the card. Each time a player chooses to influence a card played by another, this one gains a smaller one-time bonus. This participation aspect reflects what really happened among historically families in those years...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "I, Dr. Schism, being of sinister mind and not-bad body, leave one bequest to my underlings. The gift of petty conflict!<br/><br/>In Bequest, players will strategically split Dr. Schism&rsquo;s fortune with their villainous neighbors! Each player draws five Asset cards, and splits them into two piles for the player on your right, who will choose one to keep, leaving you the other, while you do the same with the piles split by the player on your left. Once everyone has chosen, you&rsquo;ll collect your spoils, and soon another round will begin, this time going in the other direction!<br/><br/>With a variety of different Asset types to collect, you&rsquo;ll be keeping a close eye on your neighbors to figure out what they&rsquo;re looking for, and how badly they need it. You&rsquo;ll collect matching gadgets for exponentially increasing $ values, Hideouts for set $ values, and try to avoid ending up with Evidence, which count as -$3 each once you have three or more. Global Influence earns you $10 or $20 provided you have more than your neighbors, and Schemes provide unique scoring conditions based on the rest of your collection.<br/><br/>One Asset type is Keys to Dr. Schism&rsquo;s vault, each with a spot in the drafting order for Special Asset cards, which include the Schemes, and powerful versions of the other card types. Will you pick the smaller pile with a Key, and a chance to claim Dr. Schism&rsquo;s $5 Space Station hideout? Or play it safe with a Bunker and two power cores?<br/><br/>Bequest packs a ton of strategy into what looks like simple decisions. Will you be clever enough to walk away with the lion&rsquo;s share of Dr. Schism&rsquo;s estate, and become the next great supervillain?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The war raged across Germany from 1618 to 1630 with the Habsburg, Holy Roman Emperor retaining the upperhand. Then the tide of war changed when King Gustav Adolf of Sweden, the &quot;Lion of the North,&quot; revitalized the cause of the Protestant princes of Germany. Bankrolled by France, the Swedes pushed their advantage towards the Emperor's most valuable ally, Maximilian of Bavaria. Though Catholic, France sought to keep the power of the Habsburgs in check by financially supporting the Swedish King.<br/><br/>From 1632 to 1648, Bavaria and the surrounding area became a crucial battlefront to knocking Bavaria out of the war. The Swedes enjoyed success until fate removed their King and their over-extended forces could not hold onto their gains. After the Swedes suffered a sharp defeat at N&ouml;rdlingen in 1634, France was forced to play a more active role or lose all she had paid for. A series of seesaw campaigns ensued as the French Arm&eacute;e d'Allemagne secured crossings of the Rhine and pushed the war back into the heart of Bavaria. The area became the proving ground of the greatest generals of the age - Turenne, Cond&eacute;, Mercy, de Werth. Neither side possessed a clear superiority of forces so it was a dangerous game of cat-and-mouse, march, counter-march, siege, and surprise attacks. After several years, a combined French-Swedish campaign finally broke the back of the Bavarians in 1646 and Maximilian made a separate peace. It did not last long; after a year he reluctantly rejoined the Imperial cause. Repeating the winning combination of 1646, the French-Swedish army ended Maximilian's enterprise at Zusmarshausen in 1648.<br/><br/>Won by the Sword is the first game in Ben Hull's Great Campaigns of the Thirty Years War series. It is a two-player game of operational warfare in the 17th Century. Armies maneuver on a point to point map of Southern Germany based on the road network available at the time. Each game is centered around a major battle or full campaign season. A Turn is a month divided into a variable number of impulses. Each army has a hand of Campaign Cards that control the amount of activity it may perform, the supplies it must expend, and a special action. Each impulse features one card play per army. Forces are concealed off map so players are faced with limited knowledge of the enemy. The major activities are maneuver, foraging, besieging fortifications, and an occasional battle. Won by the Sword is a low-complexity game with emphasis on the players maneuvering their forces, but many decisions await. The low rules complexity allows each player, rather than being encumbered with rules, to focus on choices regarding how to manage his campaign.<br/><br/>",

Each character has movement, fighting, and search skills; inventory for two or three items; and a unique special ability for use in the advanced game.<br/><br/>On a turn, all of the characters on one team act first, one after another, then the opposite team goes. During your turn, use your action points to move your character and search on the island. If you meet someone from the other team, you can fight them, whether to steal the treasure or simply to set them back. When you search, you might find move and fight tokens to save for the future; flags that let you claim a dock on the island to make it easier to leave; or clues to the treasure. The clue tokens let you play cards, and those cards determine where the treasure will be found &mdash; ideally in a spot more advantageous for you than the other team.<br/><br/>Once the final clue has been found, the treasure is up for grabs, with a team needing to have one of its characters possess it on a dock to which they have access at the start of their turn. Thus, holding it isn't enough as the other team can possibly steal it away on their turn.<br/><br/>",

Each game in Rebel Fury is quick-set-up, quick-playing, and deeply interactive. The density of counters in each scenario is low, allowing you to see and experience the big picture of the battle.<br/><br/>Rebel Fury places you, the player, in the role of the Army Commander (Lee, Burnside, Hooker, Bragg, Rosecrans, Grant).  You maneuver your army to find the enemy&rsquo;s flanks, concentrate your forces for an attack, and determine where to commit your artillery assets.<br/><br/>Units are portrayed at the Infantry/Cavalry division level. The Civil War Heritage Series game system features a new Zone of Influence/Zone of Control mechanic that controls unit formation (March/Battle) based on their proximity to your opponent. As your units close with the enemy, your forces naturally break into battle formation, where they then maneuver the last distance to engage.

Roll the Buccaneer Bones (landlubbers call them &quot;dice&quot;) to send ships out to sea. When you reach the island, you get a special bonus just for being there. But the best part is the treasure! Find the treasure and bring it back to port, then set sail again. The first pirate to bring back three treasures claims the title of &quot;Scourge of the Seven Seas&quot;! Arrrr!!!<br/><br/>Each player in Buccaneer Bones starts with six ships on the six numbered ports of his player mat; each ship is in a sailing lane that consists of a port, a sea space, and an island. On a turn, the player rolls four dice, then rerolls as many as he wants; if he now has a pair, he advances the ship matching the number rolled one space (from port to sea or from sea to island) and if he has a three-of-a-kind, he advances the appropriate ship two spaces (from port to island). When a player has a ship on an island, he receives a bonus:<br/><br/><br/>    When on islands 1 or 6, he rolls one extra die; on islands 1 and 6, he rolls two extra dice.<br/>    When on islands 2 or 5, he can add or subtract one from a rolled die; on islands 2 and 5, he can do this twice.<br/>    When on islands 3 or 4, he can reroll any number of dice one extra time; on islands 3 and 4, he can reroll two extra times.<br/><br/><br/>When a player has a ship on an island, if he has a three-of-a-kind matching that island number, the ship grabs one treasure, then returns to port.<br/><br/>If a player can't advance a ship, he can place his first mate (1) as a scout on an island to grant himself that power on his next turn, (2) as a thief on a treasure owned by a player with more treasure than him, giving him a chance to steal it next turn if he rolls any three-of-a-kind, or (3) as a defender to remove a thief on one of his treasures.<br/><br/>The game ends the round that a player collects his third treasure. If he's the only one with three treasures, he wins; if multiple players have three, then the tied player who has more ships farther from his ports wins.<br/><br/>Buccaneer Bones includes a couple of play variants, including rules for a solo game.<br/><br/>",

Who thought it was a good idea to match chain tracks with a poison needle? That team will need a lot of help from their sponsor to have a chance. Look at their opponents, tentacles with anti-matter flail &mdash; that's a classic. Seems like we are ready to start. It's time to freak out!<br/><br/>In Space Freaks, you are team manager of one of the fighting teams sponsored by powerful megacorporations. Your task is to combine different body parts to design the perfect freak, then lead your team of freaks to victory. The arena is controlled by the arena master, who each turn changes the conditions in the arena. To succeed, you need to complete tasks given to you by the viewers &mdash; or just destroy the other freaks and their base. But don't worry because in Space Freaks everyone wins, either by managing the winning team or by becoming a (body)part of the next winning team!<br/><br/>In more detail, during the game you build your own freaks, one body part at a time, in addition to building turrets, bunkers and droids to aid your team. Your team sponsor might also aid you in the form of items, special actions, or even alien marauders. You score points during play by fulfilling tasks given to your team by the viewers, killing competing freaks, destroying an opposing base, or controlling the center of the arena.<br/><br/>",

In the actual contest, Tsarist Russia resented British expeditions into the Steppe Khanates while Victorian Britain feared that Russian entreaties to Persia and Afghanistan would jeopardize India's security.  So the two imperial powers wove a complex tale of diplomatic intrigue, colonial conquest and proxy wars that spanned 50 years.<br/><br/>In the game, players alternate moving officers (historical personalities) and troops across a point-to-point map of Central Asia in yearly turns.  Imperial powers strive to enlist vassal states such as Afghanistan and Bokhara into their camp through diplomacy or combat.  Vassals offer troops and tribute to their imperial patron.  But there's a twist, vassals closest to Russia prefer alliance with Britain while those closest to India prefer Russia, so an engaging game of move-counter move unfolds across the chessboard of Central Asia.  Random events such as the Crimean War, Sepoy Mutiny and American Civil War intrude to make each game different.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carrousel is a game without turns. The board shows a carrousel with seven spaces in a circle. Placed on this (on five adjacent spaces) are five different-colored horses. The game also contains a deck of cards, each showing three horses in different colors.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player is dealt nine cards and lays them out in front of herself. The object is then to make the three horses at the front of the carrousel be in the same order as on one of one's cards. When this happens, you get a point for that card (put it upside-down in a private score pile) and get to draw a new one.<br/><br/>There are a number of legal moves to make, like swapping the places of two horses, placing the last one first and so on. To score a card, you must perform a move to make the first three horses match one of your cards. If you make a move and they don't fit, you lose one point. If you're not fast enough, someone else will move something, messing up your plans.<br/><br/>The game has been illustrated by Stéphane Poinsot.<br/><br/>From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Here's a strange merry go round!  Its wooden horses, joking and mocking, have come to life and nothing can stop them for turning in any direction!  If you want to ride, you'll have to catch them!<br/><br/>To play Carrousel, you don't have to be a knight, jockey or a cossack.  A little speed and observation will do.  Find the right color combinations and move your horses quickly before your opponents do it for you!<br/><br/>Carrousel is a game of speed and observation by Max Gerchambeaux who, when he's not cooking one of the best cassoulets in Paris in his restaurant, invents smart games for the whole family!<br/><br/>",

One of the others, meanwhile, has been possessed by the Spirit of Fenrir the Wolf, and will try to prevent the Chosen One from reaching the Organ.<br/><br/>The goal of the game, is to identify and deliver the Chosen One and the song of Making (which is composed as part of the game play) to the Inscrutable Organ of Eternity before the 12th hour.<br/><br/>011 is played over 11 rounds, called Hours. Each Hour is divided into 5 phases. All players, in order, must complete one phase, before the next phase begins:<br/>1. Reveal Event<br/>2. Bid for Turn Order<br/>3. Place Clues on the Map<br/>4. Character Actions and Movement<br/>5. Play Location Tiles<br/><br/>Once all 5 Phases are complete, advance the Hour Hand one space on the Ragnar&ouml;k Clock. If the Hand reaches XII (and so, the 11th Hour has passed), the game ends and all players lose! Otherwise, a new Round begins with Phase 1.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To Take Washington: Jubal Early&rsquo;s Summer 1864 Campaign is the third game in the Series: Line of Battle (MMP) series and covers Jubal Early&rsquo;s campaign during the summer of 1864. From June into July, Old Jube swept out of the Shenandoah Valley and across the Potomac River to advance on Washington DC. By threatening the Federal capital, Early and the Confederate command hoped to divert forces from Grant&rsquo;s Overland Campaign, relieving the pressure on Richmond.<br/><br/>Historically, Early narrowly defeated Lew Wallace on the Monocacy River, outside of Frederick, MD. However, this &lsquo;victory&rsquo; cost him precious time and manpower. Though he went on to test the outer forts protecting Washington itself (mainly at Fort Stevens), Early was too weak and too late to take advantage of the once-denuded nature of the fortress garrisons.<br/><br/>As Abraham Lincoln quipped, &ldquo;Mr. Early, you are late.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In To Take Washington, players first fight the Battle of Monocacy. Their relative success or failure there, as well as their raw efficiency, determines when the Confederates show up on the separate Fort Stevens map. An arrival mere hours earlier than their historical appearance makes an enormous difference in the strength of Union forces manning the defenses, since they had been stripped bare prior to Early&rsquo;s advance. Conversely, a mediocre showing at Monocacy will present the Confederate player with a very difficult problem at Fort Stevens. Jubal Early couldn&rsquo;t solve it &ndash; can you?<br/><br/>To Take Washington covers these two related actions on two separate map areas. One (with two map sheets) covers the Monocacy battlefield while the other (with one map sheet) shows the area around Fort Stevens and a portion of Washington itself.<br/><br/>The Series: Line of Battle (MMP) series premiered with None But Heroes, covering the Battle of Antietam, and went on to set a new standard of excellence with its presentation of Gettysburg in Last Chance for Victory: The Battle of Gettysburg. The LoB series rules are the pinnacle of over 30 years of development starting with the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series and its follow-on Series: Civil War Regimental Sub-Series (MMP). The LoB system and battle-specific rules incorporate fresh research while discarding the mistaken assumptions and false impressions that have crept into ACW games of the past forty years. Above all, Line of Battle is designed to capture the free-for-all nature of an American Civil War battle in a fun, fast, and very playable format.<br/><br/>Scenarios: To Take Washington includes twelve scenarios, with one entry point for the full two-battle Campaign Game. Ten of the scenarios use only one map (either a portion of the Monocacy map set, or the single Fort Stevens map).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 15-30 minutes<br/>Hex: 110 yards / 100 meters<br/>Units: Batteries to Regiments<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Three 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheet (840 1/2&quot; counters - 267 playing pieces, rest markers)<br/>One 36-page Line of Battle Series v2.0 rulebook<br/>One 20-page To Take Washington rulebook<br/>Two 6-page dual-side printed LoB Charts &amp; Tables v2.0 booklet<br/>One single-side printed Terrain Key<br/>One Single-side printed Turn Record Track chart<br/>Two 6-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-15 hours<br/><br/>",

Hill's men held out all day against a rising tide of Federal troops from both the 1st and 9th Corps and were saved only by the late arrival of D.R. Jones and Hood's divisions.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that it was a rather sharp defeat for the rebels, Hill remained justifiably proud of the fight his men managed for 12 long hours atop South Mountain. They had given Lee the time he needed to concentrate his army in the face of a suddenly aggressive Federal force.<br/><br/>South Mountain is the fourth game in the Civil War, Regimental Series. With one map and a manageable number of counters, it is the first game in the series to offer a full, intense, battle that is playable in an evening.

        "description": "Iwo, Bloodbath in the Bonins 19 Feb &ndash; 17 Mar 1945, is a solitaire board-wargame using a modification of the Series: Fire & Movement combat system (Decision Games). Developed to portray the mechanized battlefields of a later generation, F&amp;M stresses the use of fire support to generate breakthroughs, followed by a rapid penetration by mobile reserves.<br/><br/>Iwo Jima was a critical point on the flight path of US bombers from their Saipan bases to their Japanese targets. The island would be a refuge for malfunctioning or damaged bombers coming or going. An obvious target for a US amphibious assault, the Japanese had reinforced the garrison and dug miles of tunnels the length and breadth of the island. Their goal was to inflict maximum casualties on the Americans to force them to reconsider the seemingly inevitable invasion of Japan. The resulting battle was brutal, even by the standards of the Pacific War.<br/><br/>On Iwo, the Japanese fought from within an extensive tunnel network, neutralizing the usual fire support effects and limiting maneuver to the US approach to each fortified position. The Japanese units are hidden, their strength revealed only at the instant of combat, so the US player must mass against a position to play it safe, using fire support to suppress the defenders and so reduce attacker casualties (a key victory condition]. On the other hand, the US player must clear the island to win, and time is not on his side. Sooner or later he must take risks to push the battle forward. Taking some terrain, like Mount Suribachi, is critical to weakening the island's defense.<br/><br/>The Japanese defense is handled by a short, simple set of priorities when conducting Japanese bombardments, punctuated with an occasional Banzai charge. A weak attack against a bunker may only displace the defenders to another position, where they will have to be attacked again. The rules include an option for a two-player game, with a second player handling the<br/>Japanese forces.<br/><br/>Note: This is a SOLITAIRE game with two-player rules included.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: 2 days<br/>    Hex: 350 yards / 300 meters<br/>    Units: Company to Battalion<br/><br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    One 17 x 22&quot; full color map<br/>    One dual-side printed countersheet (100 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 4-page Iwo rulebook<br/>    One 8-page Fire &amp; Movement Folio Standard rulebook<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Very High<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 1 (Solitaire game, but 2 or more can play)<br/>Playing Time: 1-2 hours<br/><br/>Players will need to include one 6-sided die for play.<br/><br/>",

Gen. Washington attacks Lt. Gen Henry Clinton's rearguard at Monmouth Court House.  The legend of Molly Pitcher is generally associated with this battle.<br/><br/>The game uses Wellington's Victory's system, modified for the American Revolution era. No cavalry charges and complex rules. The main aspects of the rules include unit facing, morale modified by casualties received, command control and fatigue due to hot temperatures during the battle. Victory is determined by eliminating enemy strength points and capturing the 4 crossroads in the battle area.<br/><br/>Map terrain has five levels in increments of 30 feet, with each hex spanning 100 yards side to side. Each infantry unit represents a regiment (or several regiments for some Colonial units); each artillery unit represents a battery of two guns; each dragoon unit represents a regiment of cavalry. Turns represent 20 minutes of real time. Three scenarios are provided: one introductory involving the hedgerow battle, and two advanced covering Monmouth Courthouse and the Grand Battle.<br/><br/>Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine Nr.90 (Jan/Feb 1982)<br/><br/>",

Larger than life characters such as the fierce SHU general ZHANG Fei, the cunning WEI warlord CAO Cao, and the legendary SHU strategist ZHUGE Liang have inspired generations of people with their stories of valor, deceit, and strategy.<br/><br/>Legends of the Three Kingdoms replicate this historic age and allows players to assume the identities of these fabled heroes.  Combining these heroes with role play, battle, deception, and other elements, we created a fun and exciting game that can be shared with many.  We hope you will have as much fun playing as we had bringing this game to you.<br/><br/>Legends of the Three Kingdoms (a.k.a. San Guo Sha) is a card game based off the Chinese classical novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, and shares many rules with BANG!. The differences are as follows:<br/>1. The Monarch (Sheriff) may get an additional skill related to their kingdom allegiance; players routinely have two powers.<br/>2. Weapons may have their own additional powers.<br/>3. A card to let a player borrow a weapon from another.<br/>4. A card to cancel the effect of other cards.<br/>5. Peach (Beer) may be played by any player when someone loses their last life; there is no exemption of using Peach when there are only 2 players left.<br/>6. The game proceeds counter-clockwise.<br/>7. Reincarnation*: The Dead may return to the game (start with 1 life) when he gets 3 or 4 cards from other players (a player may only give 1 card to the Dead within his round); the risen Dead are not counted to the winning condition.<br/><br/>*(removed from rules since 2010)<br/><br/>*(This version (LTK) has since been phased out for War of the Three Kingdoms (WTK). The alternate gameplay mode of &quot;Kingdom Wars&quot; is only available in English under the new WTK name.)<br/><br/>",

Each player begins with a blank card mat which is slowly filled with cards that represent different units of orcs, goblins, war machines, and treasure.  Each card has its own rules which affect play.<br/><br/>Once a battle line is completed with a standard at the front, a musician at the rear, and all the spaces filled in between, it can be used to disrupt another player's unfinished battle line.  The games ends when a player has all three lines completed.  Each card has a point value which is then tallied and added to a bonus score for any completed battle lines.  The winner is the player with the highest score.  Also, many of the cards used to relate to old Citadel ork and goblin miniatures, in theory.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Chaos Marauders (Second Edition) (Fantasy Flight Games, 2009)(See summary of differences)<br/><br/><br/>",

Or, if you don&rsquo;t have any of the led suit, which alternative market gives you the best chance of profit? Be careful, your opponents can also play Faux Diamonds at any time, and this will cause the markets to fluctuate!<br/><br/>The deck in Faux Diamonds consists of sixty cards, numbered 1-13 in 4 different suits as well as 8 faux diamond cards. In each round, the players start with a hand of ten cards. Each player will select one card to keep facedown as their end of round diamond sale. One player leads a card, and everyone else must play one card, following suit if possible. As you play a card, if you cannot follow suit, you immediately get to sell a diamond in the suit you did play. The player who played the highest card in the suit that was led wins the trick, and also gets to sell a diamond.<br/><br/>The player who won the trick leads a card to start the next trick. After a full Round of nine tricks, each player will then sell their end of round diamond.

        "description": "Paris, XVIIth century. Cardinal Richelieu is centralizing power in the name of King Louis XIII and defends France against those he considers its enemies: the English, the protestants, the Habsburgs and French nobles scheming against him and the crown. Will you side with the cardinal, or will you be seduced by the promise of wealth and power from the queen and foreign nations? Be warned that the cardinal will hinder too ambitious intrigants. Become an influent noble in the court by accumulating prestige and favors. The player most helpful to each faction is also rewarded at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Richelieu is a tactical game with a lot of bluff and interaction, with intrigue everywhere. Every instance of intrigue will pit Cardinal Richelieu against his enemies. The players are nobles taking sides in these intrigues by placing agents with secret values and thus influencing the intrigues. Will you choose to side with Richelieu or the conspirators &ndash; or perhaps even help both? You can keep your support secret or make it directly known to others when placing your agents at the intrigues. It costs money to place agents, but the winning faction gives higher rewards for the players that helped them the most.<br/><br/>The Cardinal's mood is influenced by his success or failures, and he will become intolerant against too influential nobles (i.e. the players), who will have one fewer action to spend during a turn as a result.<br/><br/>There are many possibilities and opportunities to score points for the player who foresees and thwarts the plans of other players. During the game, you will constantly have to choose your side: Will you side with the Cardinal, or will you be seduced by the promise of wealth and power from the Queen and from foreign nations?<br/><br/>Winner of Plateau d'or 2009!<br/><br/>",

This time, Princess Bubblegum and her NiceLands deck take on Lumpy Space Princess&rsquo;s totally rad dual-Landscape deck in a royal rumble.<br/><br/>NiceLands Creatures are all about using the damage on them to make them better. Most Creatures are looking for a particular sweet spot of damage. Sometimes you will want to heal damage from your Creatures to get them there. But sometimes you might actually damage your own Creatures to get them to that sweet spot. This new deck not only brings a new Landscape to the mix, but a whole new style of play.<br/><br/>Lumpy Space Princess&rsquo;s deck is a Useless Swamps and Blue Plains deck. This is the first time a Collector&rsquo;s Pack has featured something other than a mono-color deck. The Useless Swamp side of the deck is themed around discarding cards to power up your Creature abilities. Which is never a bad thing for the swampy side, as they thrive when they have built up a sizable discard pile.<br/><br/>The Blue Plains side of the deck is themed around replacing Creatures you control. Many of the Creatures in this half of the deck get killer bonuses for replacing Creatures that were already in play. It complements the Useless Swamp desire for a large discard pile as well. Such synergy!<br/><br/>",

Create an amazing circus show and breathtaking acts and performances by cleverly stacking different wooden meeples. Acrobats, guest stars, special numbers, and wild animals come together in a dexterity game with rules that are easy and quick to learn.<br/><br/>In Tiny Acrobats, which combines the excitement and thrills of Meeple Circus with new rules and streamlined scoring, you have three rounds to create your show and perform numbers that will meet the public demands, which change at the end of each round. During each round, you select the meeples that you want to add to your troop, then assemble them on stage. Players have a limited time to achieve their prowess simultaneously. Practicing your dexterity, use your meeples to collect applause and earn points. You have to reproduce the figures requested by the public, stage the special arrangements of your guest stars, and raise your troop high in the air because it will bring as much applause as its height. The player with the most applause after three rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, the Russian armies did not comply.<br/><br/>He finally got a big battle at Smolensk, which could be called a French victory...except the Russian armies just retreated and burned. Now under the command of (recalled from retirement) Marshal Kutuzov, the army made a stand near the small village of Borodino, which had only marginal useful defensive terrain but was the best place to stop the French before Moscow.<br/><br/>After two days of skirmishing and probing, the major battle took place Monday, September 7. About 250,000 troops were involved and the two armies lost about 70,000 casualties. It was the single bloodiest day of the entire Napoleonic Wars period &mdash; &quot;Bloody Monday&quot;.<br/><br/>Using the game engine from Moscow '41 (and not VNG's Waterloo 200), the game Bloody Monday provides action and challenges, plus the joy of die rolling. Unlike other VNG products, Bloody Monday uses large 20mm blocks to provide enough detail and different unit types but still keep the game playable in one sitting. Colorful PVC stickers and &quot;fog of war&quot; give players everything they need in an easy mechanism.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In May of 1863 the Confederacy was winning battles but losing the war. In the west Grant was moving on Vicksburg. In the east, the Army of Northern Virginia was holding off the Army of the Potomac, but Lee realized that this could not last forever. Something had to change, he would strike north and take the war to the enemy. After weeks of maneuver, a chance collision between the two armies would seal the fate of the Confederacy. Now is your chance to change history. Can you do better than Lee and crush the Union army as it arrives piecemeal? Or as Meade will you hold the heights and dash the last great hope of Confederate victory? The decisions are yours&hellip; in Gettysburg 150!<br/><br/>Gettysburg 150 is an expansion of the ideas contained in Hold the Line. Like Hold the Line, it uses command action points for units to move and attack. The CRT is simliar, although artillery is weaker at longer ranges due to the greater scale of the battle. However, the board is not modular and infantry units are stronger. Units are division level, with brigade level cavalry. Advanced features like column movement is covered simply with movement bonuses for not moving adjacent to enemy units. More importantly, the game has optional rules to increase realism, including early reinforcements, army demoralization due to heavy losses, and rules to encourage corps organization. The game has 4 scenarios covering days 1, 2, and 3, as well as the Confederate attack on Little Round Top on July 2. Scenarios are playable in 1 hour for the day battles, 20 to 30 minutes for the Little Round Top scenario. The complete 3 day battle is playable in 2.5 to 3 hours.<br/><br/>A division level Gettysburg game in honor of the 150th anniversary of the battle.  This simple fast playing game comes with a mounted 25 x 22 map, two counter sheets, rules, and dice.  You can play the entire battle in 2 to 3 hours, with 4 shorter scenarios.<br/><br/>Players will maneuver the counters representing the Union and Confederate armies across a hex cover representation of the battlefield at Gettysburg.  Each turn players get a number of action points that will allow them to maneuver, fire combat, and close combat enemy forces.  You will always receive some action points, but will never be sure exactly how many recreating the uncertainty of command and control. Victory is obtained by driving the enemy from the field by capturing terrain objectives or eliminating enemy units.<br/><br/>The game uses the popular Hold the Line game system as its base.  Optional rules include a Chaos of War table, force march, and more.<br/><br/>Includes a mounted game board, 2 counter sheets with large 7/8&quot; counter sheets, dice, and rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This third installment in the Space Infantry series takes the core concept of an elite squad of veteran sci-fi soldiers fighting through random obstacles to reach an objective, using only the tools they bring with them and what they can scrounge from the environment to a new level.   Main additions are co-op play, dice, and &quot;node&quot; cards.<br/><br/>The chit-based random number generation system has been replaced with physical dice. Static maps have been replaced with randomized locations on a set layout. Nodes towards a mission goal still exist but are no longer printed on the mission sheet. Instead, a deck of &ldquo;node&rdquo; cards are drawn and placed on an 11 x 17 map sheet as mission progresses.   To further customize the experience, the &ldquo;node deck&rdquo; can be split into specific encounter types such as zero-G, hazardous terrain, science facility, and so on.<br/><br/>Space Infantry: Resurgence also brings together every module, both by LnLP and by the game&rsquo;s developer, including New Worlds, Hordes mode, Steele Bones, and The Last Outpost with new components, systems, and artwork.<br/><br/>",

When three of the buttons of the same zone are revealed, hide them. When you shoot a friend, shuffle the three buttons of the colour of the shot. When you shoot an alien ship, remove it from the board. When you land on a new tile, flip it to reveal its hidden face. There can be nothing, a meteorite or a satellite. When an alien ship reaches the planet, it damages its shield. Once there is no shield left the next damage is the last one and game is over.

The designer has added new pieces and scenarios to this edition of the game.<br/><br/>This 2-player game recreates General Patton's attempt to seize the key city of Metz and to get across the Moselle River before the retreating Germans can form an effective defense.  The U.S. forces comprised of three divisions of the 20th Corps had just completed an epic pursuit across France after the Allied breakout from the Normandy beachhead.  The exhausted Allied forces were at the end of their supply line and has barely enough resources left for one last push. If they had been able to get across the Moselle River, they would have compromised the entire German Westwall defenses. This would have enabled Patton to make an attempt at crossing the Rhine before the end of 1944 and might have ended the war months earlier.  The defending German forces, four divisions of the 82nd Corps of the German 1st Army, were a combination of hastily collected and organized units, including fresh units from the German interior and remnants of units that Patton had been pursuing across France. The battle, which began on 7 September 1944 and lasted for about a week, was a singular opportunity that could have gone either way. Historically, the Germans won, but just barely.<br/><br/>Scale: Each unit is 1 regiment or brigade, each hex is 4 kilometers, and each turn is 1 day.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>&bull; One 4-page, color instructions booklet<br/>&bull; 40 color, die-cut 5/8&rdquo; mounted game pieces<br/>&bull; One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; color game map with tables<br/>&bull; One 4-page, color BATTLESSON (TM) booklet<br/>&bull; Game setup illustration, optional rules, and player&rsquo;s notes<br/><br/>Reimplementation of:<br/><br/>     The Drive on Metz<br/><br/><br/>",

But there is hitch: ferocious monsters are guarding the gems! If the warriors join forces they can defeat them. But the coward who, blinded by his greed, will not fight seriously might get his companions punished by the monsters! The warrior who will remain loyal and will betray at the right time is the genuine hero of this game.<br/><br/>In Dungeon Busters, the players take the role of heroes exploring dungeons and defeating monsters in search of treasures. In order to defeat a monster, every player simultaneously plays a power card face-down then reveals the values. If two or more players play the same value, they are all ignored. If players are defeated the player who played the lowest value should return some treasures as a penalty. If players succeed to defeat the monster, players can divide rewards but the player who played the lowest value will go first.<br/><br/>Japanese summary:<br/><br/>協力なくして勝利なし！裏切りなくして報酬なし！<br/>手札に書かれた数字は武器の攻撃力であり勇気のバロメーター。<br/>より弱い武器で挑めば宝石を得るチャンスと共に、死の危険も迫ります。涼しい顔して嘘をつき、仲間を裏切る事で、より沢山の宝石を手に入れることが出来ます。<br/>真の敵は目の前のモンスター？それとも笑顔で話す隣のアイツ・・・？<br/>「ダンゴーダンジョン！」は、仲間と協力しながら敵を倒しつつも、その仲間を出し抜き裏切る事で真の勝利を手に入れる、信頼と疑惑がせめぎ合う【（非）協力型カードゲーム】です。<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the entry for Rail Baron:<br/><br/>BOXCARS is the predecessor of Rail Baron.<br/><br/>In the late 1960s or early 1970s, previously unknown designers R.S. Erickson and T.F. Erickson, Jr. began<br/>boardgame development. In an era when both the railroad and board gaming industry was in flux, the Ericksons managed to combine elements from the two to create a game that has withstood the test of time. In fact, it provided solid footing for the whole &quot;train gaming&quot; genre.<br/><br/>The Ericksons decided to publish the game on their own, and released it as &quot;BOXCARS&quot; in 1974. It was billed as &quot;The Informative NEW travel game of OLD-time railroading.&quot; For a first-time effort, the components of the resulting boardgame were surprisingly refined and professional.<br/><br/>The single-piece board unfolded to reveal a map of the United States on which routes of 28 historic railroads were traced. The rules of BOXCARS vary from those of Rail Baron in several ways. For example, BOXCARS has no restriction in the re-use of routes: this allows players to circle along the same track as long as desired. BOXCARS also allows a player to trade, sell or auction a RR at any time during the game. Furthermore, BOXCARS lacks the Express and Superchief locomotive upgrades that Rail Baron contains.<br/><br/>Before long, the Ericksons' game caught the attention of The Avalon Hill Game Company (AH). The original designers apparently sold the BOXCARS rights to AH and were obligated to quickly disperse the remaining copies of their game. It is estimated that there were only 1000 copies of BOXCARS ever printed.<br/><br/>AH scaled down the game's physical size to match the &quot;bookshelf&quot; style of many of its other titles, modified the rules, and released it as Rail Baron in 1977.<br/><br/>(Description adapted with permission from &quot;An Illustrated History of Rail Baron&quot;)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "South China Sea (SCS) provides an integrated political-military simulation of near future contention and conflict around the South China Sea.  Players take on the roles of China, the United States, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.  They simulate current political tensions through card play and structured negotiation keyed to real world events in an effort to &quot;move the needle&quot; to their side.  Unfortunately, the cards with the greatest chance of moving that needle, such as Chinese Coast Guard and U.S. Freedom of Navigation Exercise, are also most likely to trigger armed conflict.  If and when that happens, play transitions to traditional hex-and-counter format on a map scaled at 45 nautical miles (nmi) per hex and turns of 3-7 hours.<br/><br/>SCS is derived from Breaking the Chains (BtC), but is definitely a different game.  How do the two differ?  SCS begins with political turns that can lead to victory without armed conflict.  For armed conflict, SCS focuses more closely on the South China Sea (45 nmi per hex) rather than the larger southeast Asian region of BtC (70 nmi per hex) and uses smaller units such as air squadrons, ship pairs, and land battalions.  Therefore, the SCS map shows more detail, but less territory.  SCS employs streamlined versions of BtC's turn structure and strike mechanisms that expedite play by dispensing with numerous cycles and strike paths.  SCS nodded to ergonomics by putting all scores on one side of each counter &ndash; less flipping.  Most important, SCS allows naval units to move more than one hex in a single turn, but includes a mechanism, based on stealth, that enables the other side to &quot;check&quot; multi-hex moves to create a more dynamic, variable, and volatile environment.  This last adjustment allows quick moves at a distance, but prevents close-in ships from &quot;jumping&quot; through the beaten zone of modern anti-ship cruise missiles (ASCM), 290 nmi in some cases.  And, every turn has the option for a negotiations phase with some structure to enhance political play if desired.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "デザインタウン：未開地 (Design Town: Wilderness) is a standalone expansion for Design Town (a.k.a. Flip City), a deck-building game in which you have no hand at all, but instead play cards directly from the top of your deck.<br/><br/>A turn consists of two phases: card playing and building. Players play cards directly from the top of their deck and may choose to continue unless they have three cry-face icons in play, which ends their turn immediately. When they choose to stop, they move to the building phase.<br/><br/>During the building phase, a player can use the coins gained from their previously played cards to buy a new card or to upgrade a card in their personal discard pile. To upgrade a card, pay the cost and flip it over; upgraded cards remain in the discard pile.<br/><br/>Since all cards in this game are double-sided, be careful not to flip them over accidentally when placing cards into your discard pile or when shuffling your deck.<br/><br/>Whenever a player gains eight or more VP during a single card playing phase, the player wins immediately!<br/><br/>",

You arrange a man on each target, and then place the rest on various grey dots on your base.<br/><br/>You each have mechanisms to shoot little balls..catapults and crossbows and the like.  You take turns shooting 2-6 balls (depending on the die roll) at each other's targets.  You continue to take turns until you wipe out all of your enemy's targets.<br/> Connecting the two bases is a cardboard strip with trees and grey circles.  You can spend some of your shots to move a soldier towards your opponent on these circles.  You are allowed to place your shooting device closer to your opponent's base at this time...moving it up to be level with the advancing soldier.  However, advancing soldiers are quickly targeted.<br/><br/>In play, the easy shots (soldiers and simple targets) get knocked out in the first few rounds.  The rest of the game is trying to make the tricky shots.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To set up the two-player abstract strategy game Kamon, shuffle the game's 37 tokens and fill the hexagonal grid with one token on each hex. The tokens consist of one blank token and 36 tokens in six colors and six symbols, with each combination appearing once. (In earlier versions of the game, tokens were valued 1-6 in each of six different symbols, with one hex being left empty.) The blank token fills space and serves only as a barrier.<br/><br/>To start, the black player places one of their pawns on a perimeter space that touches only one side of the hex. The token on this space, e.g. the red fish, indicates where the white player must place one of their pawns on the next turn, either on a red token or on a fish token, and the white player's pawn constrains where the black player can next place a pawn. Players continue taking turns in this manner, and the game ends immediately when one of three victory conditions are fulfilled:<br/><br/><br/>     A player connects two opposite edges of the grid with their pawns (as in Hex).<br/>     A player surrounds one or more hexes with a loop of their pawns without regard as to whether those hexes are empty or occupied by the opponent's pawns.<br/>     A player prevents their opponent from placing a pawn, e.g. by occupying the yellow mountain when no more yellow tokens or mountain tokens are available.<br/><br/><br/>",

This speeds up the game a little in comparison to 1861, and also accelerates the trains somewhat.<br/><br/>This game was originally released as 1867: The Railways of Canada, but is now available as a complete stand-alone game.<br/><br/>",

A Standard rules folder, containing rules common to all four games included in the Quadrigame, is also included.<br/><br/>Scale is 400 meters/hex. 1-2 hours per Game Turn. Game mechanics are a simple movement-combat system with rigid zones of control. Sequential Player Turns, retreat and advance after combat are common to these games and surrounding to cut off retreat is a major strategy.<br/><br/>A new concept, &quot;Attack Effectiveness&quot; is introduced in this set of games. Essentially, attacking units that receive an &quot;Attacker Retreat&quot; result in combat are rendered &quot;ineffective&quot; (may not make further attacks, but still defend normally) for the rest of the day. This restriction is removed once a Night turn occurs. This makes &quot;what the heck&quot; type attacks very risky as one's army can be rendered quickly &quot;ineffective&quot; through a series of low-odd attacks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is an empire of changing flags. The old crown fell, and many stepped forward to claim it. That was two centuries ago.<br/><br/>Now the barons and the princes swear loyalty to whichever claimant-emperor garrisons the nearest army today. The clergy sell their sermons for the highest bidder, and spies whisper promises to mercenary generals.<br/><br/>You are the one true ruler of the broken Empire of Lyssan, and it's up to you to put the pretenders (the other players) in their place before their endless squabbling tears your nation apart. You (and others) will attempt to take control by using castles, knights, nobles, priests, and spies:<br/><br/><br/>    Knights hold territory and fight masterfully.<br/>    Nobles hold territory, support priests, and fight poorly.<br/>    Castles hold territory, spawn new units, and protect knights and nobles.<br/>    Priests manipulate influence and support spies.<br/>    Spies assassinate priests and other spies, and have the devastating power to steal other players' court cards.<br/><br/><br/>Lyssan is an intense board game of strategy, cooperation, and betrayal for two to four players. The winner is the player who claims the most trophies, and each trophy can only be claimed by a single player. One trophy card might call for the player to control the most mines, the next to have most spies deployed, and the next to have the most sophisticated court. An upcoming trophy is revealed each turn, requiring strength, cunning, and adaptability to win.<br/><br/>Lyssan combines tightly designed euro-style rules with the interactivity and flavor of an epic wargame. Lyssan has slim rules comparable to many family friendly games. Yet the play is as rich and interactive as the crunchiest, most grognard-friendly wargames. And Lyssan plays fast. A typical game of Lyssan runs a full hour quicker than comparable games.<br/><br/>Lyssan combines: <br/>A map to be conquered (like Risk)... <br/>...with a few different unit types that act a few different ways each (like Chess or Diplomacy) ... <br/>...with cards that let players pull off devastating surprise moves or permanently improve their abilities. To play one card, you discard others. (Like Race for the Galaxy) These cards can be very powerful, but they can also be stolen by spies. The whole landscape of the game can change in the blink of an eye as ownership of a card changes hands. Get one of your spies into a rival's castle, and you can take over his improvements or turn his own followers against him.<br/><br/>All interrupting effects have been stripped out of the game, so each player can complete their turn quickly, without waiting for the others. The game has been designed from the start to allow timed play, like a tournament chess match. This is good for players who want extra-brisk play, or who just have one slowpoke at the table who needs to be reined in.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Order of Veiel is a cooperative/ion game taking place in a dark and complex fantasy universe. Intended for 1 to 7 players, the game offers a team of adventurers the chance to face the merciless dungeon master and his corrupt hordes of monsters. You must do your best to overcome the torments of the crypt. Mutual aid, reflection and decision-making will be key for your journey.<br/><br/>You can either play against the game or against another player. If you face a player, he'll become the dungeon master by creating the dungeon, controlling the monsters and launching events at the other players. If you face the game, all the above are automated.<br/><br/>All the other player will take control of one of the 13 characters. You'll be fighting monsters, avoiding traps and curses, opening chest and doors, spending money to the smith or the alchemist. Everything you gather in this adventure is for the entire team. You'll think together to optimize your progression to have a chance to defeat one of the 4 bosses.<br/><br/>Combats are turn-based. Heroes take action first. They can either use their weapons, use their skills or use a consummable object. Once they all did an action, it's the monsters' turn. Monsters tends to attack the hero holding the defender token. Some of them can choose their target.<br/><br/>The dungeon is a layout of 6 to 15 cards (at the end of the games). Heroes enter the crypt by turning a card face up (Monsters, chests ...). They resolve the card before deciding to go back to the camp or going deeper in the crypt and therefore turning the next card face up. Once they are at the far end of the dungeon, they can decide to face the boss or the go back to the camp. At the beginning of the game, being a coward is the only option. At some point, you'll have to face your ultimate nemesis. Beat him and you'll win but fail to do so and you'll lose the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is VentoNuovo's continuation of the system created for Moscow '41, now looking at the campaign of Army Group North in Barbarossa. The final chapter of the Trilogy is Kiev '41.<br/><br/>Players take either the German or Soviet Union forces and use colorful wooden blocks to simulate the forces they have involved.<br/><br/>Leningrad '41 uses the same basic game engine of Moscow '41, with a few tweaks and changes to suit the differing conditions in the north. The game brings new wrinkles in as well because the Germans have &quot;allies&quot; as part of their forces-- the small but powerful Finnish Army which sought to recover territory lost in the &quot;Winter War&quot; but did not fully match the ambitions of Germany at destroying the U.S.S.R.<br/><br/>Four weeks after the commencement of Barbarossa, Hitler visited the headquarters of Army Group North.  The F&uuml;hrer&rsquo;s words were dutifully noted in the army group&rsquo;s war diary, and culminated in the following observation: &ldquo;&hellip;the loss of Leningrad might result in a complete collapse.&rdquo;<br/><br/>By the end of the third week in July the capture of Leningrad did indeed seem inevitable.  The Germans had already covered more than half the distance to the city.  And yet, as they advanced into the vastness of Russia, it appeared that everyone on the Axis side of things had a different plan; and as time went by, those plans had a habit of changing.<br/><br/>Hitler did not want his tanks entering the city; but then, he did not want his infantry engaged in prolonged street fighting either.  So, after another think about things, the F&uuml;hrer decided the city should be simply cut off and starved, or relentlessly bombarded and starved&hellip; or the Finns would be welcome to breach Lake Lagoda and flood it.  Whatever the means, the F&uuml;hrer purposed that the &ldquo;Cradle of Bolshevism&rdquo; was to be wiped off the face of the earth, and its population left to dwindle away to nothing.<br/><br/>The problem was, despite the rush of victories, or perhaps because of them, the Germans had precious little idea what to do next. Halder wrote that July: &ldquo;&hellip;there seem to certain differences in von Leeb&rsquo;s and Hoepner&rsquo;s views of what the next moves should be.&rdquo;<br/><br/>They waited to be told what to do, or argued between themselves.  Manstein, commanding one of Army Group North&rsquo;s panzer corps, knew what to do, but he was not in charge of the operation.  Delays accrued, brought on by lack of supply and the first recovery of Soviet forces.  Already within one short drive of Leningrad, the Finns were meant to help, but the Finns had their own plans; and, for the time being, they did not involve doing more than reclaiming what they had lost in the Winter War.<br/><br/>And what of Stalin?  Beyond the speeches, the threats and the executions, he sent Zhukov to the city in early September 1941, and there the man who would eventually oversee the fall of Berlin organized the workers&rsquo; militias and planned a defence that was meant to face the expected German onslaught - an onslaught, which as the weeks went by, never actually came. <br/> As the German player, in reaching for a victory that will have meaning, you are up against the clock, the terrain, and alongside Soviet resistance, the loss of units that some other bright idea from somewhere else will impose upon you.  The forces of Army Group North are not huge, so you must act to avoid your units being dispersed, and have victory in your grasp before another plan takes the panzers away from you.<br/><br/>As the Soviet player you must know what to defend and what to abandon.  You cannot be strong everywhere.  Limited time is the best ally of those defending with limited forces.  Encourage the Germans to use their time up.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a grid of 3 x 3 cards, and during the round, you should try to get your total value of cards as low as possible by replacing high-valued cards with low-valued cards. <br/>The new thing about HILO is that color matters. If you manage to get a whole row, column or diagonal row of three cards of the same color, you may discard the whole row/column. So, even a high-valued card may be worth to take as long as you believe it will be discarded. This also ensures a high level of interaction between the players. Will you leave a card on top of the discard pile that will help the next player discarding a whole row?<br/>The game is played over several rounds until one player has at least 100 points. The player with the least points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each card has a point value, ranging from -3 to 13, shown in the corners of the card. The goal is to have the lowest sum of points at the end of each round, accomplished by swapping, stealing, and getting rid of cards. Points are scored after each round, with the game continuing to an agreed mark when the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>Before the game begins, players have ONE opportunity to look at any TWO of their own cards, returning them to the same face-down position. Players should remember their value and location.<br/><br/>Over a series of rounds, players will draw 1 card and chose to keep the drawn card, exchanging it for one of their own face down cards or immediately discard it, possibly triggering a special ability allowing them to peek at, swap or give additional facedown cards to other players.  When any player feels as though they have the lowest hand of cards in front of them, they call Archduke which triggers the final scoring of each round.  The lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The fighting that month, north of the besieged city of Mantua, proved to be one of the first great challenges in the young General Bonaparte's career. Two Austrian forces under Marshal Alvinczy and Lt. General Davidovitch threatened to converge on the French from the north and east, join together at Verona, and march southwards to raise the siege. Bonaparte's task was to make use of his interior lines around Verona to unite his scattered and out-numbered troops, and defeat the separate wings of the Austrian &quot;pincers&quot; in detail.<br/><br/>BATTLE for ITALY is Avalon Hill's new strategy game for two players which recreates the critlcal period of November. 1796. During a typical game turn, both players attempt to move their brigades by normal and forced marches. Combat occurs when opposing forces move adjacent to each other. and is resolved by a die roll on the Combat Results Table. Important leaders on both sides are represented in play, and their Individual attributes are critical to each players success. Game victory depends on how well the Austrians do in defeating the French and exiting units off of the map to break the siege.<br/><br/>BATTLE for ITALY contains a colorful map of northern Italy around Verona, 100 playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.<br/><br/>Playing Time: 1 1/2 hours<br/><br/>Complexity Rating: 4<br/><br/>(from 1-10, 10 the highest)<br/><br/>source: back of the box<br/><br/>",

Helsinki is based on the design of Copenhagen by the same design team, but with some added complexity.<br/><br/>The center board depicts the Senate Square with 8 spaces (two per side) and 8 cards, with each card connected to two spaces. The player on their turn advances their pawn 1-3 spaces, then must choose to take cards or build a pavilion. Each space is connected to two face up cards, and the player may choose to draw these into their hand (making sure to respect the 7 card hand limit, a key challenge in the game). The cards are in one of 5 colors and show a shape of size 2 to 5. To build a pavilion, the player plays a card showing the piece they want to play, and then must play an additional number of cards of the same color to match the size of the piece. Finally, the piece must be &quot;slid&quot; onto their game board (which also represents the Senate Square) from the side of the Square their pawn is on on the main board. Covering certain spaces earns a coat of arms, which may be spent to use one of the 15 one-time special actions.<br/><br/>Players score points for completing rows and columns, and the player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The battle of Gettysburg was a huge struggle that locked armies of the North and South in three July days of bitter warfare which turned the tide of the Civil War against the Confederacy. Among the many small actions that made up this battle none was more important than the fight for Little Round Top, a rocky forested hill on which rested the extreme left flank of the Union line. It was here that the outnumbered 20th Maine regiment held off repeated Confederate assaults, turning back the South's best chance to win this battle which they could not afford to lose.<br/><br/>Little Round Top is Avalon Hill's new game for two players which re-creates this critical battle. During a typical game turn, both players move their company sized forces over a map of the battle area, positioning them for rifle fire and bayonet charges. Fire and melee combat are resolved by a die roll on the appropriate Combat Results Table. Regimental officers and their command abilities are crucial for keeping the attack moving forward or the defense intact.<br/><br/>Little Round Top comes complete with a colorful map of the battlefield, 100 cardboard playing pieces, and a short rules booklet.<br/><br/>Playing time: 2 1/2 hours<br/><br/>Complexity rating (from 1-10, 10 the highest): 4<br/><br/>",

Players may finance their acquisitions with loans from the Bank, although the interest rate may become exorbitant.<br/><br/>Lancashire Railways is the first game in the Early Railways Series and is the progenitor of later Wallace titles such as Age of Steam and Railroad Tycoon.<br/><br/>",

Al&rsquo;s a bit eccentric; he doesn&rsquo;t trust the cops or banks, so all his loot is in his mansion, guarded by a diabolical security system of explosive traps. The good news is that he&rsquo;s out of town.<br/><br/>It would be a shame if something happened to all that loot, but a Family (working together) that bested Al would make quite a name for itself. Of course, the most fame - and (dare we say) leadership of the Family - goes to the person who walks away from the job with the most loot.<br/><br/>Your colleagues may not agree with you - but you all owe each other favors. Calling in the right favor at the right time is what leadership is all about in this business. The key is to work together to help yourself - and don't get blown up!<br/><br/>In The Mansky Caper, players team up to ransack rooms of Al Mansky's mansion, opening safes to find the valuables inside.  Split loot with others in the room, and watch out for twists of fortune and dangerous traps that can ruin your plans with a bang!  The winner is the player who has accumulated the most loot in their private stash at the getaway car by the time Al&rsquo;s mansion is completely ransacked.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Pocket at Falaise is a game on the final phase of the Allied campaign in Normandy. After the failure of Hitler&rsquo;s counterattack in early August to halt the Allied breakout from Normandy, the German 7th and 5th Panzer Armies found themselves on the verge of being pocketed by converging American and British pincers. On the evening of August 16th the Germans began to pull back behind the Orne and Dives rivers, hoping to regroup for a defense of the Seine, even as the Allies attempted to close the trap on some twentyfive German divisions. Ultimately, about half the German forces in the pocket escaped, leaving almost all their heavy equipment behind. It was a major Allied victory, but not a war-winning one.<br/><br/>At the end of the Gulf War in '91, cable TV news was full of horrific photos from the &quot;Highway of Death,&quot; the route back to Iraq from Kuwait that seemed, almost literally, to be &quot;paved&quot; with burnt-out vehicles. Those who study WWII remember similar destruction... on the road out of the Falaise Pocket... where 25 German divisions raced for survival, while the Allied armies aimed to turn Hitler's delayed counterattack on Normandy from failure to war-ending disaster. In one sense, neither side succeeded. But the devastation was something unprecedented.<br/><br/>Now, you have a chance to do better. The Pocket at Falaise puts each player in the difficult position of trying to overcome the obstacles, both human and mechanical, tactical and operational, that interfered with success in 1944. Award-winning designer Ted Racier explains:<br/><br/>The story of the Falaise battle is that of two German armies trying to escape a trap set for them by their own high command, and of the Allied armies trying to close the trap, despite the hesitations and divisions of their own higher commanders.<br/><br/>While we may think of the Allies as having overwhelming forces, at the actual point of contact, there were relatively weak units trying to &quot;plug the leak&quot; against overwhelming numbers of intensely motivated Germans. The situation means that the &quot;retreating&quot; Germans are actually forced to do a lot of attacking, while the &quot;advancing&quot; allies found themselves in a desperate defense. The Pocket at Falaise uses a chit-pull activation system to capture some of the chaotic and uncoordinated efforts. Players are forced to juggle to make the best out of an increasingly difficult situation, and a combat scale that straddles &quot;tactical&quot; and &quot;operational,&quot; aiming to capture the best of both without adding a lot of fiddly rules. A complete set of solitaire rules for the game completes the package.<br/><br/>Eisenhower called it, &quot;The Great Killing Ground.&quot; What the Germans called it cannot be printed.

        "description": "Players have hands of four cards numbered 1 through 19. Play 1, 2, 3, or 4 cards to place a stone on the gameboard, which consists of 36 numbered squares in a non-obvious order. (The yucata implementation allows for alternate arrangements.) The goal is to claim four squares in a line, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. But multiple stones can be placed on a square, and a square is only safe if a player has two more stones on it than any other player. If four-in-a-row is not achieved within 20 turns, the game ends in favor of the player with the most points.<br/><br/>Fourmation is a version of the game with a modular board published by SimplyFun.<br/><br/>________________________________________________________________<br/>And here the more simple successor of Just4Fun , with colors instead of numbers :<br/>Just4Fun Colours (published by Kosmos in 2010).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blade Rondo is a card battle game from Domina Games for one or two players.<br/><br/>The game distinguishes itself from other card battle games in several ways. One is the way decks are built - out of the forty &quot;key cards&quot;, each player is dealt fifteen and has to choose just seven to use during the match. Stronger cards tend to be single-use, meaning you need to balance longevity and power when making your choices. Additionally the small card set means you can make assumptions about what your opponent might have, though without total certainty.<br/><br/>The game's solo mode isn't just tacked on - 20 cards are included just for use in solo play, and allow you to enjoy the game by yourself. Pawn, the designer, is well known for his previous solo-only releases such as Shephy.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The AI (or an optional second player) controls the North Vietnamese forces through movement and attack rules.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by controlling at least three regions of Vietnam for a majority of the game.

On a turn, someone rolls the two dice, then calls out the sum. Each player either:<br/><br/><br/>    Writes this number in an empty space in their grid, or<br/>    Circles this number in their grid if it had been entered on any previous turn.<br/><br/><br/>Initially, of course, you can only write a number as you have nothing to circle. You're trying to do two things in Knaster: circle lots of numbers, and fill the rows, columns, and diagonals of your grid with &quot;scoring combinations&quot; of numbers, i.e., three- to five-of-a-kind, two pairs, a full house, or a straight. When you place five numbers in a row, column, or diagonal and you have created one of these scoring combinations, then you immediately circle 1-3 numbers in this same line. If all the numbers in a line are circled, you can then circle the number (5-10) outside the grid that's next to this line.<br/><br/>As soon as someone fills in the 25th space in the grid, they let everyone know this, then after one final turn, the game ends. Your score is equal to the sum of the circled numbers outside your grid, along with 1 point for each number circled in your grid. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

At every move you must make decisions that will determine the fate of the men you command. Your troops must face bombardment from the enemy's artillery, tanks and aeroplanes. How many men will you risk on a particular course of action?<br/><br/>A game for 2-4 players where you take a role as a British Company Commander attempting to be the first to reach the &quot;Objective Line&quot;. You start from your own trench and must advance across &quot;No Man's Land&quot; while trying to limit your casualties. It's a &quot;push your luck&quot; game where you roll dice and play cards matching the roll, after which you can decide to try to advance further, or stop and carry out card actions. Pushing too far could incur heavy losses.<br/><br/>",

All players reveal their top task card, which shows the goal that the player needs to hit with his own disc by flicking it with his thumb and finger. Throwing the disc is not allowed! Your efforts are complicated by several obstacles that lie scattered in the playing area, all of which constantly move throughout the game from being hit by snapped discs. The opponents' discs remain in the playing area as well, most likely exactly where they'll be the most disturbing.<br/><br/>A few spots in the arena can grant players a bonus, such as taking a gem, receiving an extra turn, or placing a barrier in the arena. Once a player completes a task, he reveals the next card and starts flicking once again. If a player has finished all eight missions and collected two gemstones of each type, he wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each deck contains cards representing actions, buildings (including 5 church/cathedral cards), and 9 knights.<br/><br/>The cards have three functions: they can either be used face up as an action, knight or building; face down as land or discarded as money to pay for other cards.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a castle card surrounded by one land card of each type. On your turn, you play cards to build your barony and acquire resources, by going through three phases in order.<br/><br/><br/>     Play action and knight cards and use building abilities.<br/>     Add one land or one building to your barony.<br/>     Tax up to four adjacent lands in your barony to draw cards.<br/><br/><br/>To win, you must first build a Church and then a Cathedral in your barony.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Battle Connection (or BattleCON, for short) is a head-to-head dueling card game where two heroes face off against one another in a battle of tactics and strategy. BattleCON builds upon other fighting-type games by placing a focus on tactical positioning, extreme character specialization, and a wide range of viable plays at any given moment. These elements combine to make every match memorable and action packed.<br/><br/>In BattleCON, both players take their actions simultaneously in a turn sequence called a beat. At the start of each beat, players choose their attacks secretly, then reveal them and execute them together.<br/><br/>An attack consists of two cards--a style and a base. The style is specific to your character, while the base is (typically) shared among all characters.<br/><br/>Bases (the right side of the attack pair) typically grant you movement, resistance to stun, and a set priority and range, and power. They are the tactics of combat--heavy punch, light punch, projectile, throw, and the like.<br/><br/>Styles (the left side of the attack pair) are modifiers that add your character's personal touch to the attack. They integrate your special abilities by enhancing attacks with things like time control, life drain, increased speed, the ability to absorb damage, and more<br/><br/>The first complete BattleCON set is titled &quot;War of Indines&quot;, and follows the adventures of the heroes and villains of a fantasy world. Indines (pronounced &quot;In-deanz&quot;) is a fantastic world of ancient magic, high technology, and political intrigue, where daring heroes and epic villains are daily fare, and where there's always an adventure of some type to be had.<br/><br/>",

The game allows you to refight the German invasion of France, and the low countries in May and June of 1940. Doug has been designing and playtesting the game for over 2 years and has some innovative concepts in the game.<br/><br/>Before the game begins the German player picks a strategy card that has various goals for him to attain for victory. Each player has a hand of cards that add to battle, reinforcements, and other elements that occurred or could have occurred during the game. The game is not card driven, but card enhanced. The game is chit driven. The Allied, and German armies are broken up into their larger commands, chits are placed in a cup and drawn during the game turn. When a chit is drawn, the command for that chit is activated for movement and combat.<br/><br/>Victory is determined at the end of the game if the Germans can attain the goals on their strategy card, and for the Allies if they can prevent the Germans from reaching their goals.<br/><br/>",

The treatment is broad-brush and fairly abstract: there is a map and the counters carry pictures of castles and soldiers, but you don't have to start worrying about dice and combat results; this is not a wargame.<br/><br/>Players take turns to conquer as many regions as possible with their own and opponents forces - an intriguing mechanic - then decide whether to tax the hard working peasants or not. Plenty of decision making and room for tactics with a different player/king sequence every time you play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from user review:<br/>Each player assumes the role of a intra-galactic merchant, traveling from planet to planet in a future where wars are unheard of and &quot;Traders&quot; are the heroes of the cosmos. The board shows 36 planets: six clustered together in the center of the board, six more in each of five arms of the galaxy. Planets are connected by &quot;jump lines&quot;: you can jump to an adjacent planet on an orange line, to a planet halfway down a galaxy arm on a purple line, and from one galaxy arm to another via green lines. The length of the jump line also indicates the difficulty of the jump, so to successfully complete an &quot;orange' jump you must roll a 2 or better on a single die, a purple jump requires a 4 or better, and the green jumps necessitate a 6.<br/><br/>As the players scurry about the galaxy, they can pick up and deliver cargoes, which pay both in money and in &quot;Prestige.&quot; These &quot;contracts&quot; vary throughout the game, and only one player can fulfill any given contract. This isn't to say that multiple players can't pick up the named cargo, though. But only the first player to arrive at the contract's destination gets the payoff for a contract; everyone else with the cargo is now just stuck with unwanted junk, and may have to pay a penalty to dump it. Players can also build bases on the various planets as they move around. Building bases earns the players Prestige, and when a player tries to make a jump to a planet with a base, the jump is an automatic success if the player has the owner's permission. Traders obviously have permission to jump to their own bases, but if they want to jump to an opponent's, they will probably have to pay a fee. And since only one player can have a base on any given planet, bases rapidly become lucrative investments.<br/><br/>",

This resulted in changing objectives to the relief of Festung Arnswalde and trying to cut the Soviet supply route towards K&uuml;strin.

        "description": "HATSUDEN is a game of two players with a theme of electricity supply. Although minimal in system and play time, it has a thrilling game plot and the results are never predictable. This is a game for players of all range. Please take a try.<br/><br/>Construct 5 types of renewable energy plant (Solar, Geothermal, Wind, Hydro, Biomass) and complete your supply to the city. Compete for greater electricity, also making sure to keep just the right amount for your city&rsquo;s demand. The special technology cards also play a big role as the game develops. Now, head out to the journey to become a great &ldquo;HATSUDEN&rdquo; engineer.<br/><br/>Goal of the Game<br/><br/>In HATSUDEN, players compete for 1. greater generation of renewable energy, and 2. optimum power supply to the cities.<br/><br/>General Procedures<br/><br/>Choose an open space. Place a power plant card corresponding to the renewable energy type indicated at the top of the column. Once you have placed a plant card, you have now acquired a power supply equivalent to the number marked on the card.<br/><br/>All power plants supply electricity to the city at the end of the row. A city needs a total of 10 supply, and 9 or 11 would also be permissible. If the sum of supply becomes 12 or more after a power plant construction or upgrade, you must flip one（or more）of the other power plant cards in the same row and convert it to a pylon, so the supply level is kept at 11 or less.<br/><br/>When either player completes all ten spaces provided another player takes the last turn to finish off the game. If the last player is not able to complete all 10 spaces, the remaining spaces will be filled with pylons.<br/><br/>Point Calculation<br/><br/>First of all, players calculate the generation for each renewable energy (solar, geothermal, wind, water, and biomass). Cards in the two spaces in the column are added, and the sums of generation level are compared between the players. The player with a greater generation level takes the renewable energy card face down. This will count as 1 point. If it is a tie, neither gets a point.<br/><br/>Calculate the total supply to the city by adding the generation of the plants in the row. If you have a total of 10 supply to the city, you may take the city card face down. This will count as 1 point. If the total supply is 8 or below, you will have 1 point taken away.<br/><br/>Whoever earns a higher total score is the winner of the game.<br/>If it&rsquo;s a tie, the total points from the cities（1 point from scoring 10, and -1 from scoring 8 or less）will determine the winner. If this too is tied, the player playing second will be the winner.<br/><br/>",

To win as Doctor Octopus, players must complete five schemes, such as defeating Spider-Man or amassing and paying power. Those who pick Titania will need to gain strength to become empowered and defeat She-Hulk. Finally, Kang the Conqueror will require players to unleash variants of Kang into other villains' decks and conquer four locations in other villain domains with robot duplicates.<br/><br/>Each of the characters in Marvel Villainous: Twisted Ambitions can be played on their own or be mixed and matched with villains from previous Marvel Villainous releases.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to France! Aces of Valor is a solitaire game where you command a fighter squadron on the Western Front during World War I through a campaign of multiple missions to score as many victory points as possible to assist the war effort. You can play as the Germans, or one the Entente powers (British, French, or Americans). Each aircraft counter represents the pilot and the aircraft combined, and your squadron will have up to eight at any given time.<br/><br/>The player chooses the campaign&rsquo;s duration (8, 12 or 16 missions), and draws a card to determine the objective of each mission, which includes patrols, trench strafing, photo recon, artillery spotting, balloon busting, and bomber escort. The player&rsquo;s flight moves across a gridded map that is a semi-historical representation of the Western front. Anti-aircraft fire is heaviest near the trenches but can happen anywhere over enemy territory. When combat occurs, aircraft are moved to an &ldquo;Initiative Track&rdquo; for up to three rounds of combat, where pilot skill, aircraft performance, and luck all come into play to determine the outcome.<br/><br/>The player earns mission points by destroying enemy aircraft and ground targets, and also by escorting bomber and 2-seater aircraft on successful bombing, photo reconnaissance and artillery support missions. When the flight lands, mission points are converted to victory points or used to repair and replace aircraft as well as upgrade aircraft to newer, better models. The goal is to earn enough victory points to achieve a minor, major or strategic victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Aircraft drawings by Vincent Bourguignon<br/>Counter and Map Design by Mark Mahaffey<br/>Cover Painting and Layout by Ivan Berryman and Randy Lein<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the introduction:)<br/><br/>Retro is a tactical World War II infantry combat variant rules set. Gamers may utilize these rules and the components of The Avalon Hill Game Co's Squad Leader, Advanced Squad Leader, or other popular tactical wargames to recreate World War II battles in a simplified, playable format. Though Retro enables you to make use of Squad Leader and ASL components and modules, it is not endorsed nor authorized by The Avalon Hill Game Co or other publishers. Retro should be viewed as an unoffical variant to these fine games, and presumes that players own official modules and rules.<br/><br/>Originally appeared in issues #1-#4 of Panzerschreck magazine, published here as a 48-page booklet with two pull-out charts.<br/><br/>Signficantly strips down the sequence of play, armor rules, and morale rules of ASL. A significant innovation is the concept of &quot;hesitation&quot; (which replaces most of ASL's defensive fire rules), where units moving in the open and in range of the enemy must test to determine if they freeze in place and don't carry out their move.<br/><br/>Designed with solitaire players in mind, or anyone wanting to play these classic tactical wargames with less rules overhead.<br/><br/>",

Don't wait too long for the perfect combo &ndash; the board will fill up quickly with tentacles, and the Kraken is always hungry!<br/><br/>The Refuge: Terror from the Deep also features new 1-4 player solo and cooperative gameplay in which players work together to defeat the Kraken!

        "description": "&euro;uro Crisis is a tactical as well as a satirical game for 3-4 players about the financial crisis in Europe. The players take the roles of banks with the goal of enriching themselves at the expense of the struggling states.<br/><br/>One game lasts for three years, with each year divided into four quarters. In each quarter, all players choose their action simultaneously and resolve them in turn order. As an action you can borrow money from the European central bank just to lend it in another action to the struggling states. You'll get good interest rates, especially when the state is nearly broke! But always be aware of the possibility that a state might have to restructure its debts.<br/><br/>From your earnings, you can buy gold and weapons. Gold is used to bid on privatizations of state property, which is the one thing that will truly be worth something at the end of the game. Your weapons can be used to defend your privatizations from an angry mob &mdash; or you can give them to decent citizens, just to see how the new privatization of another bank becomes public again. Last but not least, you have to be a good lobbyist to gain exactly the government or the reforms you want.<br/><br/>In the end, the player with the most points wins. Beside the privatizations, mainly income, but also gold, weapons and money add a few points.<br/><br/>&euro;uro Crisis is entertaining, with a lot of interaction and invites everyone to gamble with borrowed money &mdash; just like the euro crisis...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the game:<br/><br/>The Wars of the Roses (1453-1485) were the result of the struggle for the English crown between the Houses of Lancaster and York ... both descended from the Plantagenet line ... both with equal claim to the throne.  By the end of the bloody struggle, both houses would be extinct and the crown grasped by the first of the Tudors.<br/><br/>Sun of York is a card game depicting the tactical battles fought between the two royal houses.  Represented by the cards are all the day's major leaders, including King Henry VI (too weak a leader to maintain control of the kingdom), Margaret of Anjou (Henry's strong-willed and manipulative queen), King Edward IV (organizational genius and longest holder of the Crown), King Richard III (charismatic leader of questionable morals) and Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick (the &quot;King Maker&quot;).  Troop cards include Levies, Longbowmen, Knights, Cavalry, and mercenaries from the Continent, among others.  Terrain features and Special event cards are also included.<br/><br/>Every major engagement (and a few minor ones) is included in Sun of York, for a total of eighteen scenarios in all!  Rules for randomly generated scenarios are included as is a campaign system allowing players to fight out the Wars to their bloody conclusion.<br/><br/>Components include 200 cards, two player aid sheets, and one sheet of 234 status markers.  <br/>[This is a desktop published game.  Players are required to assemble all game components.]<br/><br/>Now also available (August 2011) through GMT Games as a boxed set!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Circus Train, by designer Tom Decker, is a 1-5 player game in which you are the owner and operator of a small circus train in prohibition-era America. In this game, you and your opponents are vying to employ the best talent while putting on the most magnificent show each month. While touring the country by train, you will have the opportunity to perform while adding talent to your show through hiring the performers stranded in cities by defunct circuses. Just remember to keep an eye on your wages, because your talent definitely will.<br/><br/>Through clever card hand management, you control the movement of your train around the American northeast, making strategic business decisions about talent, performances and payroll in this fast-paced strategy game. Each turn represents one week of real time, and after six months, the circus season closes for the year and the game ends with one player declared as having The Greatest Show on Earth.<br/><br/>Inspired by Sara Gruen&rsquo;s novel, Water for Elephants, Circus Train Second Edition includes thematic elements such as improving your show&rsquo;s reputation by picking up alcohol for your talent and staff (legally, in Canada), the high costs of supplying big cats and elephants, and the ability to &ldquo;red light&rdquo; (firing by throwing off the train) disgruntled talent or talent that has simply become too expensive to maintain. These elements are blended into the game&rsquo;s mechanics, keeping it all simple while adding layers of depth and strategy.<br/><br/>",

Complete sets are also available and individual cards may be ordered through the Columbia Games web site.  All artwork and graphics in the Dixie series (each regiment card is drawn with its historical uniform) was created by RPG/Historical artist, Eric Hotz (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.hotzartworks.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.hotzartworks.com</a>).<br/><br/>The Dixie system is an expanded version of Columbia's tactical battle board system used in such games as Napoléon: The Waterloo Campaign, 1815.  Each unit card shows its unit ID, its Combat Value (CV--the number of dice rolled), and its Firepower (the number needed to hit a target).<br/><br/>The game is played without a board; the table is divided into three battle line areas for each player (left, center, and right).  Players deploy cards face down into their three battle line areas.  Player's hands act as the Reserve area.  Each turn, every unit may either move or fire.  Movement consists of advancing into the opponent's battle line areas to engage.  Combat consists of rolling dice equal to the unit's CV with hits occurring for each die that is less than or equal to the unit's firepower.  For each hit taken, a unit must make a morale check, rolling equal to or less than their CV or &quot;rout&quot; (i.e., be discarded).<br/><br/>Play continues until one side is able to occupy unopposed two of the three opponent's battle line areas.  Rules are included for fighting a second day.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Peptide is an open-drafting card game with resource management elements. Basically, players compete to link amino acids side-by-side, forming what&rsquo;s called a Peptide Chain (in biology, this process is called RNA Translation). In order to do so, players must first select from a number of available open-drafted face up cards, which in the game represent cellular organelles. Each organelle rewards players with either molecular resources or cellular actions. Final scores are based upon the types of amino acids in your Peptide Chain, and the player with the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Starmada is a board game of starship combat. At its most basic level, players take command of space fleets in a general attempt to reduce each other to just so much space junk. At its most advanced, the game can be customized to breathe life into any science fiction background that players might imagine.<br/><br/>Novices shouldn&rsquo;t fret; the core set of rules has been designed with simplicity and ease of play in mind, accessible even to beginners. On the other hand, seasoned veterans should find the concise nature of the rules quite refreshing. It allows players to concentrate on the finer points of squashing their opponents rather than arguing about rules interpretations, without sacrificing any of the flavor or excitement of more complex games.<br/><br/>Simple, but not simplistic, is the guiding principle.<br/><br/>The Admiralty Edition represents the latest incarnation of the Universal Game of Starship Combat. Included in the 80-page Core Rulebook:<br/><br/><br/>     The &quot;essential&quot; Starmada rules, including a new inertia-based movement system. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Over 80 different options from which players may pick and choose to create the perfect game. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     A fully-customizable weapon design system, with almost five million different combinations. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     A complete set of rules for fighters, allowing for nearly half a million different types of small craft. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     A comprehensive construction system, allowing players to design their own starships with which to do battle. <br/><br/><br/>In addition to the core rulebook and 48-page Starmada Universe guide, a number of different settings are planned for the near future, including collaborations with several other companies.<br/><br/>Available both in Print and PDF print-n-Play.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Imperial Starmada Sourcebook<br/>    Starmada: Dreadnoughts<br/>    Starmada: Hammer and Claw<br/>    Starmada: Iron Stars<br/>    Starmada: The Admiralty Edition – Rules Annex<br/><br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Klingon Armada<br/>    Romulan Armada<br/><br/><br/>Later editions:<br/><br/>    Starmada Nova Rulebook<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Perryville: The battle for Kentucky, 7-9th October 1862, One of the more obscure of all major Civil War actions, Perryville was the culmination of Braxton Bragg's invasion of Kentucky in 1862.  The game recreates the events of October 7-9th, 1862, both what actually happened and what might have been...<br/><br/>In the fall of 1862, the young Rebel nation launched two invasions into border state territory. One ended in the bloody Battle of Antietam. The other&mdash;lesser known&mdash;effort culminated in the Battle of Perryville. Bragg&rsquo;s campaign to seize Kentucky from the North was of critical importance. A crippling blow dealt here would have transferred the war from Tennessee (and further south) to the Ohio River. U.S. Grant&rsquo;s efforts at Fort Donelson and Shiloh would have been voided. The war in the west would be fundamentally altered in the South&rsquo;s favor. As it was, Bragg was unable to bring in the available Confederate forces and fight a decisive battle against Buell. In this game, however, the player can take an active hand in drawing on all the Southern forces to bring on the battle that might have been.<br/><br/>With one map and 280 counters, Perryville makes an excellent starter game for players new to the successful Civil War, Brigade game series. With both the latest edition of the rules and a smaller battle to work with, new players will be able to quickly garner the skills needed to compete successfully in the other (larger) series games.<br/><br/>Perryville is game number 6 in the Civil War Brigade (CWB) Series by The Gamers (now Multi-Man Publishing).<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 30 minutes<br/>Hex: 200 yards<br/>Unit: Infantry/Cavalry Brigades &amp; Artillery Battalions<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22&quot; X 34&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32 page CWBS 2nd edition revised Rulebook<br/>One 8 page Perryville Rulebook<br/>Two six-sided dice<br/><br/>Players: 2 (suitable for solitaire play)<br/>Playing Time: 4-16 Hours (varies with scenario played)<br/>Complexity: Moderate<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this light, humorous, and fast-paced card game that parodies geek culture and co-habitation, players are roommates just trying to get through life with as little work as possible.<br/><br/>At setup each player is dealt a Job card which lists their free time, income, a special ability that they possess and their Slack goal. Players are also dealt five Life cards. The space directly in front of a player is their Room, where cards will be played during the course of the game. Slack can be represented using any available chit or counter, but every player begins with a Slack total of zero.<br/><br/>Players take turns as follows:<br/>-Draw Life cards until they have six in hand. (NOTE: Some Jobs vary this to five or seven cards.)<br/><br/>-Make &quot;variable&quot; rolls. Some Job cards have variable free time or income; their values for this turn are decided in this phase (rolling a 1-3 gives them   the first amount; rolling a 4-6 gives them the second). If there are any &quot;uninvited&quot; people in a player's room, he or she may also roll to &quot;get rid of&quot; them (by rolling a 4, 5 or 6) and either send each such person to another room or discard them (if they cannot be played to any other room).<br/><br/>-If any of the player's in-hand Life cards are green Person cards, they may roll to &quot;call&quot; the person to their room. A successful roll (3-6) gets them invited in; otherwise, they are discarded. Some people are &quot;uninvited&quot; (causing bad things to happen), and may be placed without a roll in any player's room. (See above for &quot;getting rid of&quot; these people.) Pet cards, such as Cats (which don't require a roll to enter a room) and Dogs (which may or may not need to be &quot;called&quot;) can also be played in this round.<br/><br/>-For each unit of free time the player's Job card gives them, they may perform one action (play a red Activity card) or go shopping (play any number of blue Thing cards). Some of these cards may have a cost; the total cost for all cards played in a round cannot exceed the income given to them by their Job card. (NOTE: Free Time and Income may be modified by certain Whenever cards played on the player by themselves or other players.)<br/><br/>-At the end of a turn, if a player has more than five cards in hand, the player must discard cards until they have five or fewer. If desired, players can discard all the way down to one card. (NOTE: It is also legal for a player to play ALL the cards in their hand and have NO cards at the end of a turn.)<br/><br/>-Additionally, some Life cards are orange &quot;Whenever&quot; cards which can be played at any time.<br/><br/>-Activity cards and Thing cards typically list a Slack value which is added to the player's Slack total, though some have random Slack totals and some have Slack totals which vary during the game. TV Activity cards and some Whenever cards can be used to cancel cards as they are being played, and some cause previously-played cards to be discarded. Some cards add or subtract Slack from every player's total, while others cause a player to change their Job card (and hence Slack goal). Many cards alter the effects of other cards.<br/><br/>The first player whose Slack total equals or exceeds their Slack goal is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Can you save Halloween and find the missing candy?<br/><br/>The Pumpkin Problem, title #3 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an escape room style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.<br/><br/>When you have solved a puzzle, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next.<br/><br/>The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required. Knowledge of traditional Halloween topics is helpful, but that information is also provided in the app if you need it.<br/><br/>Most groups take about an hour to solve the game. You can write on the cards to help solve puzzles, but this is not required (or you could use penny sleeves) and the game is otherwise non-destructable. So while you can't play again yourself, you could give the used game to someone else to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In December 1944 Hitler launched a massive offensive against the weakly held Ardennes forest section of the Allied front in Belgium. Achieving complete surprise, the Germans nevertheless faced tough resistance from the battle's opening days, and the offensive was virtually over 10 days after it began. There followed a bloody Allied counterattack which gradually erased the bulge the Germans had created in the Allied line.<br/><br/>But you probably know all that. Yet another Battle of the Bulge game? Why yes. But one with a different approach. Specifically, award-winning designer Ted S. Raicer has taken a modified version of the chit pull system pioneered in GMT's The Dark Valley: The East Front 1941-45 and brought it west for an exciting new take on this classic wargame subject.<br/><br/>The scale of the map (which takes up about 2/3rds of a standard 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo; map sheet, the rest given to tracks, charts and tables) is at 3 miles to the hex.  Allied units are mostly regiments and brigades, ,with most German armor and infantry divisions divided into two kampfgruppen (battle groups),  German artillery, Greif commando teams, infantry trucks, and the Von der Heydte paratroop unit are included as Asset markers, as are Allied artillery, scratch units, and engineers.<br/><br/>The game runs from December 16 1944 to January 16 1945 when the Allies reunited their divided front by recapturing the key town of Houffalize.  Each turn through December 31st equals 2 days and the turns in January are three days long. The full campaign lasts thirteen turns while a scenario for just the German offensive is six turns long. But with The Deadly Woods' chit system and its multiple Action Rounds, a lot can happen in only six turns.<br/><br/>Each side gets a number of Action Chits each turn, which vary both in number and type.  These include multiple Reinforcement chits which determine the arrival Round (but not Turn) of Allied and German reinforcements. There are German Logistics Chits which introduce historical supply effects. There are Movement or Combat chits which allow a player to choose. There are also Movement chits and Combat chits which limit the Active Player to the capability listed on the chit. And there are special chits, such as the German 5th Panzer and Allied Patton chits that allow some combination of Movement and Combat.<br/><br/>After the Initiative Player chooses the first chit played, the remaining chits are drawn randomly from a cup. A player may draw up to two consecutive chits and then enemy player must get the next chit.<br/><br/>Armor is severely limited in moving through other units along roads and bridges and at projecting ZOC into woods terrain. Combat may result in losses, retreats, surrender, or stalemate.<br/><br/>Each turn should take roughly an hour for players who know the rules.  The German Player can win an instant victory by exiting units off the north map edge west of the Meuse or by holding 5 objectives at the end of a turn.  Otherwise the game is won on geographic Victory Points. (The Germans also gets Victory Points for crossing the Meuse in supply, even if they are forced back across the river, so he has a reason to push even when the arrival of the British makes an Instant Victory impossible.)<br/><br/>So another Bulge game, but one with the historical action and decisions of games with a much bigger footprint and playing time. And with a unique take on the chaos and friction of the battle that makes it a great choice for solo play. Even if you are bulged out, you'll want The Deadly Woods in your collection!<br/><br/>Components<br/>22&quot; x 34&quot; map<br/>1.5  5/8&quot; countersheets<br/>Rulebook<br/>Player aids<br/>Playbook<br/>Game box or ziploc<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First Ascent is a rock climbing-themed strategic board game. The goal in this medium weight, competitive game is to gain the most points by climbing the best route up the mountain and becoming the most skilled climber! Each player assumes the role of a unique asymmetric character, and throughout the game they will be building their route up the mountain, managing resources, achieving objectives, and increasing their efficiency by accumulating skills and gear! This game is for 2-5 players and takes 45-90 minutes to play.<br/><br/>Gameplay overview: <br/>In First Ascent, the goal is to gain the most points by creating the best route! Points are gained in four ways: <br/>1) Climbing pitches &mdash; use your climbing skills, gear, water, and psych to pay the requirements to move on to a tile &quot;climb the pitch&quot;. Draw a climbing card and resolve the events that may involve resource management, board manipulation, or selfish vs altruistic decisions. Each tile is worth 1-5 points with higher point value tiles requiring more resources.<br/><br/>2) Objectives &mdash; achieve shared and personal objectives that relate to the path of your route. Plan carefully and manage resources to execute the path that will contribute towards achieving your objectives.<br/><br/>3) Technique bonuses &mdash; the climbing skills and gear cards contain symbols representing climbing techniques of precision, power, balance, and pain tolerance. Match three technique symbols on the cards you play to climb a tile and earn +2 bonus points. These can add up significantly, so choose your resources wisely.<br/><br/>4) Summit &mdash; reaching the top of the mountain is great, but climbing is about the journey. Gain +1 summit bonus point for reaching a peak.<br/><br/>If you don't have the required resources to climb, you can &quot;risk it&quot; by rolling the risk dice to climb a tile for one less resource. You may get away with a check mark and succeed without consequence, roll minus two cards and give them to another player, or roll minus one card and one psych which you give to another player. As long as you have the assets to lose, you will climb the tile, but at a price.<br/><br/>When you begin to ascend the mountain start in any tile on the first row. Next climb to any adjacent tile and leave your rope behind to mark the route you've climbed. Two climbers can not occupy the same tile, except for a summit, so you may compete with other climbers on the mountain for the prime locations.<br/><br/>As you climb the mountain you will practice your skills and become a more efficient climber. The engine building component of this game grants you an &quot;earned asset&quot; after you play four cards of a specific skill type or gear. These tokens stay on your climber asset board and count towards fulfilling the required assets of future tiles.<br/><br/>This isn't a race to the top, its about creating a strategic route that will reward your cunning and planning. The game ends when a player has used all seven rope lengths and climbed their eighth tile.<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to create the greatest First Ascent?<br/><br/>",

The game is designed to put the emphasis on command and control on the battlefield, with the players commanding a company a side plus a range of support platoons.  The rules cover infantry and armour combat between 1939 and 1945 and may be used with our four theatre specific handbooks which provide full information on organisational structures and weapon capabilities.<br/><br/>The smallest tactical unit in I Ain't Been Shot Mum is the infantry section or squad of the weapons team with support weapons such as mortars or machine guns.  The basic command units are the platooons.  The rules handle fire by section or weapons team and the turn sequences are dictated by the Game Deck of cards which can be tailor made to suit any specific situation.  With sections covering infantry and armored combat, artillery and air support, and morale covered by the elegant and &quot;test-free&quot; shock system, the rules allow smooth flowing games where the players have minimal contact with the rules and maximum contact with the tactical situation.<br/><br/>Included in the rules is the Normandy Handbook which covers the periond June to August 1944.  There is a scenario generator which will provide fast set-up games with no advanced planning, a section on writing historical scenarios and four specific scenarios, two starter games and two historical actions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lord of the Rings: the adventure deck game is a solitaire game, that takes from 5 to 15 minutes to play.<br/><br/>In Lord of the Rings: the adventure deck game, the player is Frodo, whose goal is to reach Mt.Doom, drop the One Ring into the volcano's lava, and save Middle Earth.<br/>He has to hurry, as Sauron is gaining power, so the journey cannot last more than 25 days.<br/>In his journey, Frodo will encounter friends who help him (from Aragorn to Legolas) but he'll also encounter enemies (like Trolls and the Nazgul) that threaten Frodo and make his mission harder.<br/><br/>From the rules:<br/>&quot;Consider the card as a crossroad: therefore you are given choices on where to travel (up, left and/or right).<br/>The Directions show numbers (which range from 1 to 5) and show how many cards need to be drawn in order to proceed with the quest.<br/><br/>B. Each card shows an aggression number (ranging from 0 to 3) which represents the attacks you have received while travelling.<br/>Sum the aggression numbers  of each card you draw to get an Attack value which represents the amount of wounds you have sustained this turn.<br/>At any time, if the total attack value is higher than Frodo's wounds, the player immediately loses the game.<br/><br/>This means that the Attack value will be the sum of all aggression numbers of cards drawn this turn.<br/><br/>Example: if the player chooses directions with a high destination number, which makes him move faster, he will finish the mission within the preset time of 25 days/turns, but will also increase the chances of getting damaged and killed.<br/><br/>At any time, but before drawing cards from the quest deck, you can use the RING which will turn Frodo invisible and, therefore, immune to all the attacks received (consider all aggression numbers as 0). BUT doing so will also bring the Witch King closer to you. Any time you use the Ring, put a token on the the Witch King Track on the play mat.<br/>The first time you use the ring, put a token on the Ring symbol on the play mat: this is a reminder that the ring has been used at least once.<br/><br/>While drawing or before drawing (depending on the item), the player will have the chance to use one item he is equipped with.<br/>The player can use only one item per turn.<br/><br/>C.  Card Effects can be good or bad, depending on the card.<br/>A player resolves the card effects ONLY of the last drawn card of the turn. Unless otherwise stated, the ONLY thing the player should take into account while drawing the cards is the aggression number.<br/><br/>Example: if the player chooses a direction with a destination number 3, he draws (one at a time) 3 cards, adding the Aggression Numbers of all 3 cards and resolving ONLY the effects of the 3rd card.&quot;<br/><br/>Each turn, the player will have many choices to make, from deciding if he wants to rest (and recover his wounds), to which direction to go; from using potions or other items (like the Ring), to going looking for Aragorn to help him against the Witch King.<br/><br/>Main game mechanic: push your luck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As a peasant of unquenchable thirst for fame you embark on a quest to become the greatest Beast Slayer the world has ever seen. Why though risk your own neck? Try faking a creature&rsquo;s assault on an unsuspecting village, disguising yourself as a Beast from the Barn. But always remain watchful &ndash; you&rsquo;re not the only one who desires to become a famous beast slayer. Other peasants, jealous of your glory, will do what&rsquo;s in their might to humiliate you and take away your fame. They will make fake quests, play filthy tricks on you, make the beasts stronger and expose your deceptions.<br/><br/>Stwory z Obory (&quot;Beasts from the Barn&quot;) is a dynamic card game full of negative interaction with Slavic fantasy backdrop and a humorous flair. The aim of the game is to get 7 glory points, which are received for defeating a beast or making a quest.<br/><br/>To fight with the beast you use the bought equipment, disposable bonus cards, potions and rolls of the die. In the deck of cards you will also find events as well as special cards, which help you fight or mess with your opponents&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

Today the preparations for the opening of the new exhibition start: Slip into the role of a tour guide, visit the museum rooms and study the paintings as best you can. Choose the best route through the museum and find on a coherent sequence. Those who succeed in doing this can present their tour to inquisitive tourists at the end and receive commendation and prestige.<br/><br/>On your turn, you must perform these actions in order:<br/>a) movement: you must play a card from your hand (value 0-8) in front of you to move your pawn through the museum.<br/>b) study: you must play another card (value 0-8) face down into your pawn's area, next to the painting.<br/><br/>Now it's the next player's turn. After everyone has had 4 turns, complete the dealing phase:<br/>Distribute the paintings to the players with the highest total value in each area and place the paintings in front of you.<br/>Important: The order of your collected cards may not be changed at any time!<br/><br/>End of game &amp; scoring:<br/>Sum up the values of the various icons (=tours) on your collected paintings that are lined up &quot;consecutive&quot; one after the other. Add the values of your cards that are still in your hand. The player with the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Your deck of cards contains primary and secondary weapons systems, thrusters, special abilities, and various other high-tech instruments of war. Draw cards and place them onto the table as fast as you can, but be careful or you might overheat! If you don't wish to play a card, place it face down and it acts as cover for the round, absorbing a bit of damage from your opponent. The action is in real-time, but a game round ends when a player snags the FIRE! button from the center of the table. The speed of the Mechs are calculated, which determines the engagement range. Then weapons are fired and internal heat is generated. Quick reflexes are helpful, but a quick mind will win every time!<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn the German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Spiel des Jahres&quot; contains events related to the games of the year, the sometimes odd jury decisions and almost anything, true boardgame geeks should love. It can be played as a stand alone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;1866: The Struggle for Supremacy in Germany&quot; is a two-player simulation dealing with the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 in Central Europe. One player controls the forces of Prussia and its allies, to include the young Kingdom of Italy and the other player controls the forces of Austria and its German Confederation allies. Using a shared deck of 55 Operations Cards, each player makes decisions concerning the deployment, combat and political-military operations in support of his forces and his general strategy. Orders of battle include all the historic corps/divisions (with some brigade counters) and all major generals involved in the conflict. The mapboard covers an area from Hamburg to Florence and Metz to Cracow. The system includes unique mobilization rules that reflect the difficulties of mobilizing for war while attempting to garner as many victory points before war is actually declared. Once war is declared, you must fight with the forces mobilized, so shrewd judgement is required as to what to mobilize, where those forces will operate and who commands them. Always waiting in the wings is the French 2nd Empire under Napoleon III, prepared to intervene if neither side appears able to clinch a quick and decisive victory. Other features include cavalry superiority, railroads, Prussia&rsquo;s mobilization advantage and coordinated attacks. 1866 includes two scenarios, the Mobilization to War scenario (the Campaign scenario) and the Seven Weeks War scenario (covering the post mobilization situation). The cards are sub-divided into Mobilization and War decks, which are combined after war is declared.<br/><br/>&quot;1866&quot; is designed by John B. Firer (designer of &quot;Spartacus&quot;). In addition to the basic game components, &quot;1866&quot; includes a comprehensive Playbook, which includes an extended Example of Play, Designer&rsquo;s Notes, Optional Rules, a select Bibliography and complete and extensive Card Explanations.<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Average<br/>Time Scale: Weekly turns<br/>Map Scale: Point-to-Point depiction of Central Europe from Denmark to Northern Italy and East Prussia to Eastern France<br/>Unit Scale: Corps/division<br/>Players: 2 players<br/>Playing time: 4 &ndash; 6 hours for the Campaign Scenario<br/><br/>",

Five Arab armies, poised at the borders of the newly declared state, launch their determined invasions &ndash; and each must be pushed back in turn before any reaches West Jerusalem, the new Israeli capital.<br/><br/>As the headlines unfold and the vast forces of the Arab League relentlessly press forward, can you successfully allocate the precious few resources of the new Israeli Defense Force (IDF) to conduct daring offensives that will send them reeling back? Can you push the Arab legions back so far that an armistice can be achieved and these threats removed? Or will you be over-whelmed and defeated, seeing Zionist aspirations crushed?<br/><br/>Wargames recreate situations so that they can be studied and played, and Israeli Independence is particularly well suited to classroom use.

England has built an extensive empire on which the sun never set, vastly extending its domain beyond the British Isles on the spur of the Plantagenets, a royal lineage that dominated much of medieval European history, a dynasty forged from steel and blood, a lineage that would prevail for more than half a millennium. Plantagenet is a name that inspires admiration among enemies and fear among allies.<br/><br/>Henry II, the first Plantagenet king to extend and stabilize his domains, contracted a political marriage with Eleanor of Aquitaine, a marriage intended to generate heirs to the throne. This strategic alliance by marriage produced four heirs: children who would rebel against their own father, more than once, leading to war, bloodshed and pacification, the stuff history is made of.<br/>Who is going to inherit the throne? Who will prove to be worthy of the illustrious name of Plantagenet? After years of battles and rivalry, only two of the heirs survived.<br/><br/>The first, opposed by his own father, is a man with a destiny marked out by his own land, which he rarely set foot on as he was preoccupied for his entire life in conquests beyond the British Isles. The hope of an entire era would depend on his choices. The difference between being the usurper or the chosen one would depend on his actions. He is Richard I of England, better known as Richard the Lionheart.<br/>The other, the last born, was far removed from the throne. Overshadowed by his own family, derided by his own people and saddled with the unfortunate title of &ldquo;Lackland&rdquo;, John Lackland had the opportunity of a lifetime: Richard left for the Crusades and John could claim the throne for himself in Richard&rsquo;s absence. But would he have the mettle of a king? Would he surpass his more illustrious brother Richard? Would he be able to counter his brother&rsquo;s supporters?<br/><br/>A wise choice as to with whom to form an alliance is crucial to one&rsquo;s place in history. Only brave choices will crown the true king of England, and only those who loyally and valiantly supported him in the conquest and administration of the kingdom would be remembered in history. This is a choice that only the strong and the wise would make.This is history.<br/><br/>In Richard I, the players assume the role of the characters who remained in England when King Richard I left for the Crusades. They have to decide which side to take without knowing whether Richard I will return home a victor with glory and riches, or he won't come back at all (but there are many possible intermediate outcomes).<br/><br/>During the game, the players take turns to influence the different characters available in order to earn prestige points (PPs) for themselves, but also to use their powers to influence the Crusade from far away by sending resources. A player might even decide to betray his own side, if worrying news were to come from the East...<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the outcome of the Crusade leads to an increase of PPs for the players who were deployed by the faction which has achieved its goal, but the game has only one winner: the player who has accumulated the most PPs, regardless of the faction to which he belongs!<br/><br/>The object of the game is to amass the most Prestige Points (PP) by wisely choosing alliances and exerting influence on the performance of the Crusade.<br/><br/>",

Players then put in turn a card on the table, *trying* to put theirs in chronological order. A player may, instead of adding a card, claim that the order in which the cards were put is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/>If the order was correct then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order was incorrect then the previous player, who accepted the order as correct, receives three cards. The first player that gets rid of all the cards wins.<br/><br/>Bluffing is as least as important as knowledge in this game. Most events are rather obscure or are hard to date exactly, so this ain&rsquo;t no game for the nerds/geeks of this world, even they might think so, because it&rsquo;s full of surprises and pure fun. Highly Recommended, because Anno Domini is a blast to play, is a very enjoyable social event and you even learn something from it.<br/><br/>Unfortunately there is no English edition in existence, but this game could be a good way, to improve your already existing German skills or a very good reason, to learn German language in the first place.<br/><br/>The Set &quot;Anno Domini - Im Namen des Gesetzes &quot; contains historical events related to things that went wrong completely. It can be played as a standalone or together with the other sets, which is the best way of playing it.<br/><br/>Part of the Anno Domini series<br/><br/>",

Each player assumes a secret mask with hidden VP-bonus and sends out a &quot;dancer&quot; to fulfill various functions at 6 different &quot;stages&quot; (or rather &quot;adventure places&quot;). Players can try to accumulate spell cards, heal, trigger events, fight monsters for treasure, or fight other players for VP's. The spell cards are musically themed with names like &quot;Nocturne&quot; or &quot;Fugue&quot;.<br/>The game uses a small deck of (very sturdy) cards, and the assortment of game elements allows for a variety of strategies. Although the game utilizes relatively few luck elements, it becomes chaotic through the many different effects of the cards and the variable dancer powers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Relive WW2 in Europe from 1939 to 1945. Two to five players, with excellent solitaire suitability. <br/>&quot;Black Swan&quot; is a block wargame with over 200 combat units. A game turn is three months (a season) and there are several three-season Scenarios and two Campaigns (1939 and 1941).<br/><br/>When in 1939 Hitler ordered the invasion of Poland, few in Germany - and probably in the rest of Europe - believed that France and Great Britain would have declared war.<br/><br/>In the previous months Hitler had broken the Treaty of Versailles, by which the harsh conditions imposed had humiliated and starved the German population for years and led to a political reunification of the original German Reich: restored the Rhineland, annexed Austria and invaded Czechoslovakia, with the tacit consent of the other nations, Great Britain and France above all.<br/><br/>So his assumption that he could have done the same with Poland had a logical basis. Instead this time events went another way. <br/>Most European countries had been so devastated by WWI that few wanted another war. Ignoring the German preparations for a renewed war of revenge based on the new Blitzkrieg tactics, France developed an old fashioned concept of static border fortifications - the Maginot Line - and Chamberlain's Great Britain focused entirely on diplomacy in an attempt to deal in a gentlemen fashion with the rapacious and very ungentlemanly Nazi regime.<br/><br/>Even after the fall of France, which surrendered in a few weeks after a blitz attack across the Ardennes - almost the same move adopted at the beginning of WWI - Great Britain still tried to reach an agreement with Hitler.<br/><br/>This did not happen and Great Britain remained alone, with no American help, and was on the edge of the defeat, having to choose between an unfair peace or the threat of an invasion. It was only one man, the freshly appointed prime minister Winston Churchill - going against any logic and even against his own political peers and the Crown - that wanted to resist, and the outcome of the Battle of Britain later proved him right. <br/>However many months would have to pass before the Soviet Union first and the US later would join the Allied cause to restore peace in Europe, at the cost of millions of deaths....<br/><br/>As the Axis Powers you have to swiftly win the war, either by a Mediterranean strategy to break the British Empire, or an all out effort to demolish the Red Army. If a Decisive Victory is unobtainable, you can still go for a Strategic or at least an Economic Victory.<br/><br/>As the Allies, you must survive the initial onslaught and prepare for a long war of attrition before dealing a deathly blow to the Reich's body. <br/>I hope you will enjoy Black Swan, and that it will answer some of your questions as well.  I look forward to the conversations that will follow its release.<br/><br/>Historical Intro<br/>To strive in this world is to abide in the planes of chaos.<br/>Nowhere is this more readily apparent than in war. The belief in a cause, the assurance of a plan, the security of ordered ranks and painstaking calculation, all these are thrown into the hazard of conflict. Nothing ever survives.  Everything is changed.  In the aftermath, the world must always be rebuilt out of expediency and pretence.<br/><br/>Since antiquity, some have known this as &ldquo;The Black Swan.&rdquo;  It is the rare and unlooked-for event, something that is entirely unexpected and presages abrupt reversal.<br/><br/>In martial terms, The Black Swan symbolizes the unravelling of apparent certainty, together with man&rsquo;s desire to contrive notions of opportunity, or excuses for defeat, whenever he dares play with the volatile flames of ambition. Napoleon&rsquo;s fortune succumbed to this very phenomenon the moment his army moved against Russia. By the time of Waterloo, the great improviser of battlefield success had truly become the shifty and evasive apologist for disaster.<br/><br/>And then it was Hitler&rsquo;s turn.  Lying in a hospital bed come the end of The Great War, whose four year course was the embodiment of bold assertions gone awry, the infantry corporal simply could not accept the sudden and supposedly unforeseeable collapse of his beloved army.  What had gone wrong?  That army stood everywhere on enemy ground. Russia had succumbed and was occupied, and the French had been bled white.  It could only be betrayal - betrayal by communists and the craven factions in government.  These were his &ldquo;Men of 1918.&rdquo;  The German army had not been defeated.  The soldiers had simply been stabbed in the back.  And one a night in early 1933, as he stood on the podium in the packed Berlin Sportpalast, that is the story he told.  He would still be telling it twelve years later.<br/><br/>But the swan is no respecter of any cause or purpose.  Whatever things were, and whatever they become, the constant truth is, as Yeats put it: Things fall apart, the centre cannot hold, mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.  Whatever is gained or lost is not merely about having one good plan or a single bad one; rather, it is about what ensues when all plans inevitably founder.  Even if you cannot predict what is unpredictable, you should at least prepare for it the best you can. Men make plans to give order to chaos.  Whoever does that best will emerge victorious.<br/><br/>Play Black Swan with Orange Swan: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/334141/orange-swan\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/334141/orange-swan</a><br/>Play Black Swan on Vassal: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://vassalengine.org/wiki/Module\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://vassalengine.org/wiki/Module</a>:Black_Swan<br/><br/>",

Through action points, players move their troops across the battlefield and fight fiercely to death, but only if they learn to play their cards wisely they will be able to claim victory.<br/><br/>Each player plays one card face down. The two cards are revealed simultaneously. The player with the highest number wins the initiative. Starting with the player who has won the initiative, players take turns playing their cards as action points.<br/>Victory conditions: the Black Guard troop is eliminated (Christian); 8 or fewer troops on the battlefield and no Christian in the Muslim zone (Muslim); double or more troops than the rival (Both players).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In May of 1940, the Germans launched Fall Gelb (Case Yellow). Scores of German divisions flooded through the Ardennes and across the borders of France, Belgium and Holland. The blitzkrieg tactics first used in Poland, in 1939, had been put into action again&mdash;and perfected. For over six weeks the Allies, including the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), put up a staunch defense. Despite their defiance, they could not withstand the fierce onslaught of the German Wehrmacht, the fearless Fallschirmj&auml;gers and the notorious SS.<br/><br/>Heroes in Defiance depicts the full range of the battles for France and the Low Countries, from the first Fallschirmj&auml;ger airborne assaults in Holland to the closing of the pocket of the BEF and the remnants of the French Army at the Channel ports. The module combines all the scenarios and components from Heroes of the Blitzkrieg and its expansion, In Defeat, Defiance, into a new and updated complete game in the Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical Series. Heroes in Defiance also adds five new scenarios (two previously unpublished) and eliminates the need for overlays with additional maps. It&rsquo;s the blitzkrieg of 1940 at its best!<br/><br/>UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.  We add some every few weeks.

Or perhaps an innocent shipwrecked sailor in need of help? The Captain considers the tone of the voice, there is certainly something more haunting within the call, a fear. A shark? A tidal wave? What is upon on that horizon? In the blackness of night?<br/><br/>Earlier in the evening a floating body was pulled aboard. Dead. Scrawled in its flesh were visions of impossible Sea Serpents, man-like forms of Seaweed, satanic Crabs, and a haunting ancient people. It could not be real?! The Sea Peoples?! Sirens?! Impossible! The journey has been far too long and demanding, the crew, weary. They will get to port soon and be home with their families. What is on that horrible Horizon?!! A Kraken?! A Hurricane?! It could not be! There is a story of a Witch, a Sea Witch! But it cannot be real?!<br/><br/>The Captain, composing himself, whispers a prayer and asks, &quot;What is it? What do you see?&quot;<br/><br/>Sea Evil is a horror simulation experience. Unlike games that tend to aim for a perfect balance, Sea Evil's main focus is delivering the terrifying experience that occurred on this Halloween night. Characters and situations are not balanced to equal one another but created to simulate the actual experience as it happened. The game begins with a whaling ship on the sea waters, Evil begins to unfold each turn adding greater potential to destroy the Whalers. Through sea navigation and harpoon hunting skills the whalers can possibly reach the shining rays of a coastal lighthouse. THE WITCH RETURNS! DARKNESS DESCENDS UPON THE WATERS!<br/><br/>Sea Evil is a tactical hex and counter game with each token representing an individual character. Characters have sheets with some individual stats related to speed, strength and will to live. The Whalers can win if they can navigate themselves to the Lighthouse or slay the Sea Witch. Evil triumphs if it can destroy the Whalers in the waters.<br/><br/>Sea Evil, and Halloween Nightmares Horrorgame Magazine are a very visceral experience and we have rated it X. Anyone one under the age of 18 is NOT permitted to play. Pregnant or players with a fragile or nervous disposition are strongly encouraged NOT TO PLAY THIS GAME!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each square of the board has 1, 2, or 3 markings in it. The starting player (black) moves one of their pieces, moving it 1-3 squares depending on the number of markings on its starting location; a player can move a piece orthogonally in any direction, making 90&ordm; turns if they wish. A piece cannot move through other pieces, but if it ends its movement on an opponent's piece, that piece is captured and removed from the board.<br/><br/>After the first movement, the player looks at the number of markings of the square where their piece landed, then they take the neutral mana bird from the side of the board and place it on an unoccupied square that has the same number of markings. The next player must move one of their pieces standing on a square that has the same number of markings as the square where the mana bird is located &mdash; moving that piece a number of squares equal to that number &mdash; then they'll move the mana bird in a similar manner based on where that piece lands.<br/><br/>If the opponent places the mana bird on, say, a 2 square and you have no pieces on a 2, then you can either (a) move any of your pieces a number of squares equal to the markings on its starting location or (b) reintroduce one of your captured ronin on any unoccupied square of the game board. If you can't move a piece on the appropriately numbered square since they're all blocked, then you can move any of your pieces.<br/><br/>Whoever captures the opponent's Da&iuml;mio first wins!<br/><br/>A winner of the 1987 Concours International de Créateurs de Jeux de Société.<br/><br/>",

You have two distinct tactical options: raiding (stealthy movement and silent killing) and assault (speed, aggression and liberal use of firepower). Whichever way you decide to tackle your mission, you have just 60 minutes to accomplish it before the Stronghold is locked down &ndash; after which, escape will be impossible.<br/><br/>Playing the Stronghold Commander offers a strategic as well as tactical challenge. You take control of the Axis war base, deploy your Sentries to create defensive zones and send out a senior Officer to investigate reports of intruder activity.  When you have identified the threat and located the agents, raise the alarm and mobilise your Guards. Don&rsquo;t let them leave your Stronghold alive!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A long time ago in a land far, far away, there was a thriving valley with various inhabitants. They wandered aimlessly in need of a true leader to guide them. Are you the king who will lead them the way? Do you have a strategy to acquire their trust, and are you cunning enough to challenge other would-be kings? They cannot be trusted as they will do anything to claim the crown you deserve. No sacrifice is too big or small for them. They may think being king is as easy as summoning subjects to their side, squeezing the gold from their pockets through taxes, and arranging some marriages, but only a true king will be able to keep up the morale and lead the inhabitants through the ever-changing circumstances in the valley and the hills.<br/><br/>In King of the Valley, you must obtain the highest reputation of all the kingly contenders, with reputation being determined by influence, bonuses, and gold. To set up, lay out 25 of the character tiles from age I in a 5x5 grid, with each king starting on a different tile and with 2 gold in their reserve.<br/><br/>On a turn, you can first choose to acquire a tile from the &quot;hill&quot; for the listed gold price; the hill has two columns of six characters, with the characters costing 2-10 gold based on their height on the hill. When you acquire a tile, add it to your personal castle board. Characters have 0-5 influence, with the 1-5 influence characters being sorted by type and with the 0-value jester standing in for a character of your choice (but still being worth 0 influence). You then move your king orthogonally or diagonally, stopping on the character tile you want to claim; alternatively, you can move across 2-3 identical characters in a line, stopping on the space after them in order to collect them all! Add these character tile(s) to your castle board, and if you now have face-up characters with influence from 1-5, you can turn them face down to claim a kingdom bonus of points and coins.<br/><br/>To end your turn, refill empty spaces in the grid by choosing one column of the hill, then drawing characters from it as needed to fill empty spaces. Finally, draw character tiles from the stack to refill the hill, thereby giving everyone a glimpse at what can come on the playing area in the future, not to mention what can be acquired if you have enough coins in hand.<br/><br/>Specialist characters show up on the board &mdash; the priest, the wizard, and the tax collector &mdash; with you receiving immediate bonus actions should you collect them.<br/><br/>When the hill can't be fill completely, the game ends. All characters in your collection add their influence points to your score. Collecting 3-5 knights in the same order grants you bonus points, as does each pairing of a farmer with a farmer's wife. Add any kingdom bonuses to your sum, then whoever has the highest reputation wins.<br/><br/>",

Epic.<br/><br/>The Titans, war engines of the Collegia Titanica, are massive fighting machines as tall as skyscrapers.  Each carries an arsenal of deadly weapons powered by the fury of its plasma reactor and is protected by void shields and meters-thick armor.  The ground trembles before these steel giants and whole cities are reduced to burning rubble by the earth shattering energies of their weapons.  In their long shadows march armies of Knights, sworn warriors of the Adeptus Mechanicus encased in tank-sized suits of battle armour.<br/><br/>Ranged against the Imperium's Titans are the Gargants of the Ork Clans; vast, crude idols to the Orks' brutish gods, wrought in scrap metal, and bristling with primitive but potent weapons.  The embodiment of Orkish battle-lust and crazed genius, these metal monsters rumble across the battlefield on armoured tracks, grinding to dust the shattered remains of civilisation.<br/><br/>Contained in the box are an Imperal Imperator-class Titan, two Ork Mega-Gargants, ten Imperial Knights, twelve Ork Bonebreaker tanks and nine card buildings, plus rulebooks, datasheets, unit cards and counters to pit these mighty war machines against each other in Epic scale battles.<br/><br/>",

Try to build as many houses as you can while keeping in mind which houses in your hand can be built at the end.<br/><br/>In Town 77, each player has a hand of tiles, with each tile showing one of seven house styles in one of seven colors/patterns. (The color/pattern of a tile also shows on its reverse side.) The game has 49 tiles in total, one of each possible combination. Each player starts with a hand of random tiles.<br/><br/>The first player places a tile in the upper-left corner of an imaginary 7x7 square, then on each subsequent turn a player adds a tile to a row or column in this square so long as this tile is adjacent to at least one other tile and the color/house style isn't already present in this row and column. After playing a tile, a player can choose to draw a new tile or not. Once you lower your hand size, you can't increase it again. If you can't play on a turn, you're out of the game, and once everyone is out, whoever has the fewest tiles in hand &mdash; or who played latest in the event of a tie &mdash; wins.<br/><br/>If you play your final tile, you win, but if you don't draw new tiles, you might find yourself unable to play!<br/><br/>",

Players take command of platoon sized units representing German, British, Australian and Italian infantry, tanks and artillery. Standalone addition to the Panzer Grenadier series of games.<br/><br/>After shipping troops and supplies to the Italian colony of Libya, the army there finally invaded British-held Egypt in September 1940. A series of campaigns followed as first one side and then the other gained the upper hand.<br/><br/>Afrika Korps covers the battles from the first segment of this campaign, in the Panzer Grenadier game system. The fifty scenarios range from the initial Italian raids of June 1940 to the Allied &ldquo;Operation Brevity&rdquo; of May 1941. Actions range from small but intense infantry fights to wide, sweeping tank battles. Afrika Korps is a complete standalone game, not requiring any other products for full enjoyment.  All the troops and tanks of the British, Australian, Italian and German armies that fought in Libya and Egypt are included.<br/><br/>Afrika Korps has the largest playing surface in the series, with three 22x34 maps printed on heavy paper.  Of the 50 scenarios, 40 of them only require one map, and only 2 require all 3.<br/><br/>Note that this game has garnered quite a lot of criticism for the depiction of some of the Italian standard infantry counters unarmed with their hands in the air (surrendering), which none of the Allied counters have.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Panzer Grenadier: Sinister Forces<br/>    Panzer Grenadier: South Africa's War<br/><br/><br/>This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>",

The players travel from Hanse city to Hanse city in wagons filled with valuable beans, where they can deliver bean orders and buy more beans. When a player is in a city and has an order card and the necessary beans to fulfill the order, he may deliver the beans and collect the value of the order from the bank. When two or more players are together in a city, they may trade beans among themselves. Trading beans is important as it allows players to get rid of unwanted beans and acquire needed beans. In addition, a player will buy beans in the city, if it has the type he wants. From time to time, the bean supplies will be replenished as described on new harvest cards.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>A Fantasy themed miniatures wargame without the miniatures.  Will you play as the ubiquitous Elves, the barbaric Uthuk Yllan, the stalwart Dwarves, the vile Undead, the medieval Knights, the desert dwelling Acolytes, the mighty Dragon kin, or the vicious Orcs?  Players choose a faction from the eight available in the base game and an army point value for the battle. Each must then build an army using the double-sided cardboard disks and battle it out.  At least half of the army points must be from one faction and the remaining points are made up of like aligned or neutral disks and spells.<br/><br/>Each double-sided disk represents either a faction homeland (your starting area), a terrain (ruins, forest, swamp etc... with effects on combat and line of sight), a spell(levels 1-3), a missile or one unit with its alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil) with values for its Attack, Defense, Toughness, Movement and the army point cost of the disk. The disks have varying sizes (Giants and Dragons tend to be larger) and most units have a wide variety special abilities such as flying, the spell-casting ability or the missile ability to launch boulders, bolts, arrows or fireballs for example.  Players take it in turn activating 3 units(disks) and resolving battles, casting spells, and firing missiles.<br/><br/>Activated Unit disks are moved around the table by flipping them end over end a number of times up to their movement value.  If the disk lands on top of an opposing army disk a battle ensues with the top disk (the attacker) doing its attack damage value to the lower disk (the defender) who applies its defense value to the attacker if the damage is equal or greater to either unit's toughness it is either wounded or killed. Combats can involve numerous disks upon top of each other and are resolved top down. Missiles can be fired by missile capable units at disks within range by dropping them upon the target from a foot above the table. Those which land upon the target do damage otherwise they miss or can hit other disks they land on.  This can result in 'friendly fire' damage on your own troops and adds an element of luck/dexterity to the game.<br/><br/>The game rules come with multiple scenarios that accommodate 2 to 8 players.  The  victory goal of each scenario can vary from king of the hill, to enemy elimination, to just about any combat scenario victory condition one could imagine.<br/><br/>",

With their land and honor on the line, each aristocrat is rushing to gain the favor of the daughters, and to cast derision on his opponents.<br/><br/>In Seven Sisters, a hand-management, area-control Euro-style board game, the players play the roles of wealthy aristocrats who are trying to gain the favor of the king's seven daughters, who happen to be named after the seven deadly sins: Wrath, Greed, Gluttony, Lust, Sloth, Pride, and Envy.<br/>  <br/>The game consists of four rounds, with the players being dealt six cards each round. Using five of the six cards, players influence the sisters by sending servants to do the sisters' bidding. Multiple options when playing each card create opportunities for players to use both strategic and tactical play to influence the sisters more than their opponents do.<br/><br/>Each round after cards are played, scoring occurs with each sister granting her favor (victory point) and a special reward or action to the player who has influenced her most that round. These rewards and actions are thematically tied to the name of the sister (e.g., Greed rewards players with gold). Gaining this favor is important not only for the victory point, but also to gain advantages and resources for following rounds.<br/><br/>After four rounds are played and scored, another scoring round happens immediately. Victory points are tallied, including bonus points for having gained the favor of all seven sisters and for having the highest quantity of unused resources remaining (gold, fruit, and servants). The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bao is an abstract strategy game from East Africa, especially Zanzibar and mainland Tanzania. It is generally reckoned to be the most complicated of the Mancala family games that are played in many parts of Africa.<br/><br/>On a Bao board each player has two rows of 8 holes, into which counters (seeds) are placed. Moves are made by taking more than one seed and 'sowing' them along the row of holes. Depending on where the last seed is placed, you can take the seeds from that hole and continue the sowing, possibly capturing seeds from your opponent in the process. The aim of the game is to empty your opponent's front row of seeds or make it impossible for him to move.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Take The &quot;A&quot; Chord, a.k.a. Aコードで行こう, is a trick-taking card game in which players become jazz musicians and compete in the strength of the chord.<br/><br/>Cards come in five suits (colors) labeled A-G, and in a trick, you must play a card of the same suit led &mdash; unless you have a card in the same letter as a card previously played, in which case you can play that. Why would you do that? Because initially the highest-valued letter in the game, e.g. C, is determined randomly, with the other cards being ranked lower in C in order: C is higher than D, which is higher than E, etc. with G higher than A. When you play the same chord &mdash; that is, letter &mdash; as another player, you make that chord the new highest-valued letter for subsequent tricks.<br/><br/>What's more, if you play the same chord as the player who started the trick &mdash; that is, if you improvise &mdash; not only do you change the highest-ranking chord, that trick goes unresolved and you start a new trick with the winner of that trick taking all tricks played since multiple instances of improvisation can take place.<br/><br/>You score a bonus for improvisation, but you don't want to take too many tricks in a round as that will cost you points in the long run. Score well, lead the band, then step aside for others to (possibly) take things too far. After multiple rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The 2015 edition of Take The &quot;A&quot; Chord included rules only for three and four players, while the 2021 edition contains larger components and rules for 2-4 players.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>ジャズがテーマのトリックテイキングゲームです。プレイヤーはジャズミュージシャンとなって、和音コードの強弱で競います。 コードの強さが変わる転調がこのゲームの主導権を握る鍵です。勝利したトリック数によって得点をえることが目的ですが、あまり勝ちすぎてもいけません。<br/><br/>",

Search rubble, organize your defense, eliminate zombies and abobe all, do not leave your companions behind, because once infected they may well join the ranks of the enemy.<br/><br/>In a world inspired the greatest genre films, Off the Dead mixes shivers, cooperation and individual strategy, altogether in a deliciously crazy atmosphere.<br/><br/>Box Contents:<br/>87 cards including: 5 survivors, 36 rubble, 36 zombies, 5 zombified survivors, 4 infection tokens, 5 game aids, 1 die, 1 rulebook.<br/><br/>Mechanics:<br/>The goal of the game is simply to kill all the zombies that are drawn from the deck and lose as least human players as possible.<br/>Each player plays as follows during his turn :<br/>1. Action #1 (attack a Zed, search for an item OR give an item to another player).<br/>2. Zed action (they are generated, they advance and infect player).<br/>3. Action #2.<br/>4. Infection (counter incrementation : after 4 steps, player is out).<br/>Player attacks are solved by a die roll with weapon modifier.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game play in Disney Villains: The Card Game is simple, but the villains rarely stay loyal to you, possibly giving points away to other players.<br/><br/>In the game, each player takes their own villain deck, which consists of cards numbered 1-6 three times in various colors. Shuffle your deck, then lay one card face up and take four cards in hand. On a turn, you must play one card from your hand that matches the number or color of the card on top of your pile &mdash; but if the card you would play matches the top card of your left- or right-hand neighbor's discard pile, then you must play it there instead!<br/><br/>Maybe you can choose a card in hand that matches only your top card? If you have no valid play or don't want to give points away to someone else, you can play the card face down on your stack, showing the hero on the card back. On your next turn, you can play any card you like on your pile &mdash; except if it matches a neighbor's top card, of course, in which case you must give it away. (You can't play on a neighbor's hero card.) Whatever you do, refill your hand to four cards at turn's end.<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been played, everyone scores for the cards in their pile &mdash; but first they must count the number of hero cards in their pile. However many heroes they have, they must remove all matching number cards prior to scoring. If you have four heroes, for example, you must discard all 4s &mdash; and this is bad since all cards score points equal to their value. If you have nine heroes, then you first discard all 6s, then all 3s. Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>Disney Villains: The Card Game includes two special cards that each player can shuffle into their deck prior to play. (Reshuffle if you flip up a special card initially.) When you play a special card, discard it to the center of the table instead of playing it on your pile.

        "description": "In terms of its gameplay, Qwirkle Cards plays somewhat like Rummikub, with players laying down cards/tiles from their hand onto the table and possibly moving things around to create new sets.<br/><br/>In more detail, players start with a hand of nine cards from the 108-card deck; each card shows a colored symbol, with each of the six symbols appearing three times in each of the six colors. Whoever has the most cards in hand of one symbol or one color (but without duplicates) starts the game by laying these cards face up on the table as a set. Players then take turns in clockwise order.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player must add at least one card to the table; if she can't, she draws nine new cards, shuffles her old hand into the deck, then plays. When she plays, she can play as many cards as she likes as long as they share a color or symbol. She can create a new set if she plays at least three cards or she can add her cards to existing sets (as long as she doesn't duplicate a color or symbol) or she can do both. On her turn, she can move cards from one set to another, possibly using these cards with cards that she plays in order to create a new set.<br/><br/>The point of this gameplay is to create qwirkles, that is, a set of six cards that contains either each symbol in a single color or each color in a single symbol. When a player creates a qwirkle, she claims this set from the table. After a player's turn, she refills her hand to nine cards.<br/><br/>The game continues until the deck runs out of cards. Each player then takes one final turn, including the one who took the final card, then whoever has claimed the most qwirkles wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a light game -- lighter than air, one might even say -- in which each player starts the game with a card assigning a secret interest in three different balloons.  The balloon markers are lovely little brightly colored plastic gadgets, and on your turn you roll a die and choose which of the eight you want to move.  Some spots you land on give you a free roll; from some you can only go backwards.  With much shucking and jiving the balloons gradually float and bump up toward the finish line whilst players feign disinterest in their own colors in hopes they'll be promoted by others.  When all three of your balloons reach the finish, you can claim victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Factory 42 is a Euro-style board game for 2-5 players. The game tells the story of the workweek of Marxistic dwarves in a steampunk industrial setting, placing the player in the role of factory Overseers. It combines worker placement and a cube tower to create a resource management puzzle. Factory 42 is a cutthroat competitive game with elements of co-operation and deals involving Economics, Fantasy, Industry and Negotiation with a pinch of satire, but not too much to make it a Humor game. It satisfyingly blends two-fold tensions: camaraderie forged in shared goals, and the opportunistic trampling of temporary competition. A tight game of glancing blows and communal glory creating a wicked blend of sharp elbows and shared ambition. Visually, Factory 42 takes its influence from 1920&rsquo;s Soviet Union propaganda, fantasy literature and elements of pre-WWI Prussian decor.<br/><br/>The general process control at Factory 42 is as follows: <br/><br/>         Receive work orders/requisitions from the government<br/>         Receive some of the requisitioned resources (as determined by the cube tower)<br/>         Load resources (and spike additional resources) onto railcars<br/>         Transfer the railcars to docks at individual manufacturing facilities<br/>         Burn leftover resources to generate steam<br/>         Trade resources on the open market<br/>         Use steam and resources to manufacture requested items.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>    Capricious Bureaucracy:* Resources made available to all players, making up a common pool, are delivered via the Bureaucracy Tower; a mechanic that can deliver or withhold resources in a random manner. This replicates the notion that &ldquo;the powers that be&rdquo; redirect funds/resources by tying them up in red tape, trapping resources that would otherwise normally be available for the general populace. What goes into the tower does not always come out, or may have been held up during some unknown bureaucratic process, to later materialize when least expected<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Requisition:* Tactical decisions start with the acquisition of resources vital to the production process. The order of worker meeples on the requisition line dictates the volume of resources acquired for the common pool (available to all) and the number that can be obtained and stored in a player&rsquo;s personal warehouse. Choices made here can benefit a player&rsquo;s future actions but may also unwittingly aid a rival, making each choice so very important.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Loading:* Players can tactically direct their workers to the loading bays where resources are loaded onto lines of rail transport. Order here can be extremely vital to one&rsquo;s success. Misjudging the order (or cunningly foreseeing the future) may lead a player to have to load a cart for a rival rather than for one&rsquo;s self. Alliances may be made during this process, just as enemies can be made of rivals, depending on choices made when loading<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Shipping and Storage:* Once loaded, each rail cart proceeds to the shipping location awaiting direction. Workers have the option of forwarding on the loaded carts to player&rsquo;s docks. Once more order of placement is paramount as carts are only shipped in order. A cart may not contain useful resources and so could be sent to a rival, taking up valuable storage space, or maybe it will benefit a rival in an attempt to build a verbally agreed alliance. Often a cart has been loaded with a wide variety of resources and only part of this precious load is of use. Limited storage space in player&rsquo;s personal docks and warehouses dictates the shipping decision-making process as much as a rival&rsquo;s needs<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Trade and Research:* Commodities may be traded on an ever changing market, often enabling an unnecessary resource to be exchanged at a price, for something of more use. Research is equally important, allowing players to expand storage facilities, improve  material handling in the manufacturing process or even learn how to use Invention cards to add special actions/abilities during play<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Manufacture and Accounting:* The government dictate what should...no, what must be manufactured during a game round. The government orders must be completed or many, sometimes all players suffer sanctions. A degree of cooperation is needed here for the greater good of Dwarven society, but on an individual level, completion of a government order leads to reward and ultimately progression on the path to victory<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player takes her character sheet, miniature and 7-10 action cards.

Each hero player has four actions in a round, and the players can play in any order they wish; the actions are move across the base, attack an enemy, or use a special power on a played action card or the hero's character sheet.<br/><br/>Professor Skarov then receives a number of action points based partially on the heroes' actions, and he uses these to activate himself, his minions, or his robots, with these figures also performing move, attack, or special power actions.<br/><br/>As the players complete (or fail to complete) objectives, the newspapers report on who did what, and the sum of those reports determine who comes out on top.<br/><br/>",

The flipping action takes some practice but once you get the knack of it you can be quite accurate.<br/><br/>To win Carreau you need to accumulate 5 points.<br/><br/>Sometimes a flip can cause the target ball move into a new position this is likely to cause a spontaneous &lsquo;Ooo&lsquo; or &lsquo;Ahh&lsquo; as the situation completely changes.<br/><br/>On very rare occasions a flip will cause the target ball to exit the playing surface - this flip is called &lsquo;Carreau&lsquo; and it is worth 3 points. The person performing this flip is likely to shout &lsquo;Carreauooooooooh&lsquo; and spontaneously perform a dance.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the original company website entry:<br/><br/>Japan entered the modern age in 1868, with a new young emperor determined to make his island nation a world power. After decades of steady progress, Japan began its own practice of colonialism, defeating China in 1894. As the Japanese began to infiltrate the semi-independent Kingdom of Korea, they ran into Russian agents doing the same. Despite Japanese offers to negotiate, the Russian Tsar Nicholas II was set on war.<br/><br/>Great War at Sea: 1904-1905, The Russo-Japanese War covers the naval side of this turn-of-the-century conflict, which opened with a Japanese surprise attack on the Russian Pacific Fleet&rsquo;s base at Port Arthur in northern China. There are 19 scenarios, or game situations, provided, including the climactic Battle of Tsushima. There&rsquo;s also a campaign game, in which players can &ldquo;game&rdquo; the entire naval war.<br/><br/>The Russian fleet is a mixed bag of modern battleships and ancient ironclads better suited for a museum. The Pacific Fleet that begins the game in the Far East has modern ships stationed at Port Arthur and a cruiser squadron in Vladivostok. Between them lies Korea, occupied by Japan. The Russian strategic situation is difficult.<br/><br/>The Japanese have a better fleet; though not as large, their armored cruisers outclass their Russian counterparts and their torpedo boats are more numerous and more effective. They are also better-led after the death of the Russian Admiral Makarov.<br/><br/>The map covers the Japanese home islands and the seas around them. As with other games in the series, it&rsquo;s divided into zones approximately 31 nautical miles across. Fleets attempt to locate one another on this map. When contact is made, play moves to a tactical map where ships manuever and fight. There are special overlays for Port Arthur and Chemulpo, so players can use the actual terrain of these key coastal zones.<br/><br/>The original 1999 game included:<br/><br/>210 Counters<br/>    One 25&quot;x30&quot; strategic map<br/>    One 25&quot;x25&quot; tactical map<br/>    16 page Rulebook<br/>    12 page Scenario book<br/><br/>The game is being re-implemented in 2013 as Great War at Sea: Russo-Japanese War with a revised map, updated counters, new scenario book and new box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players try to move their grasshoppers across the board to their opponent's corner while simultaneously stopping their opponent from doing the same. A random tile layout makes the board different each time you play.<br/><br/>Your grasshoppers have hidden numbers 1-9 (1-7 in the online version) and the more you can get to the opposite corner, the better your score. The hoppers move 1, 2, or 3 spaces, depending if they jump from a water space, a flower or a leaf. The hoppers move forward to empty spaces, but can jump backwards if they are taking an opponents' piece. Captured pieces are also worth 1 pt each.<br/><br/>When the board is laid out, the players sit at opposing corners, so the hoppers move orthogonally on the board, but diagonally to the players' view. This can distract you such that you don't quite recognize when a capture might happen.<br/><br/>One of the best features of Subulata is that one hopper may threaten other hoppers without being at risk itself. This allows you to build an attack from which there is no defense. As the game opens, you might choose to move to attack, or try to slip by safely. But that leaves your home free to be occupied.

Each player represents the commander of one faction&rsquo;s forces. Unfortunately, each player&rsquo;s position as a Governor / Viceroy / Satrap is tenuous in relation to their larger civilization which is why you were assigned here, to the armpit of space and with scant resources, instead of to your glorious core worlds controlling the newest and best forces.<br/><br/>In the grand scheme of things, you seek to build a good reputation and make the best of your near-exile to the Star Borders, so that you can leave by advancing your career and family name.<br/><br/>Star Borders is played on connected maps arranged to represent a contested region of space. Players vie for dominance in the regions created by controling planets, nebulas, and asteroid fields. One player controls the movement and combat of the Alliance (blue) spaceforce, while the other controls the movement and combat of the Imperium (red) spaceforce. Each player, in turn, moves and then engages in combat with his units, in an attempt to capture (or prevent from being captured) key locations (e.g., planets) on the map.

        "description": "&quot;War is merely the continuation of policy by other means.&quot; &mdash;Carl von Clausewitz, On War, published 1832<br/><br/>Your goal in The March of Progress is to control countries through the playing of action cards so that you generate victory points (VPs) during scoring. Whoever has the most VPs at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>In the game, each side has a hand of eight action cards, ranging from Move to Attack to Recruit. Each player simultaneously chooses one card to play each turn, then reveals and carries out the action. Cards stay discarded until a player plays their score card after which they regain all played cards.<br/><br/>The March of Progress includes an introductory scenario based on The Thirty Years War to set out the core rules of the game. The game includes four additional historical scenarios: The Age of Marlborough, Vive l&rsquo;Empereur, World War 1 in the West, and World War 2 in the West. Each scenario changes the set-up and tweaks the rules to give a flavor of strategy in different time periods. The scenarios create a varied and challenging two-player game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Randomize the event and award cards into a single deck, with the cards being separated into groups based on the player count. On a turn, you reveal an event card from the deck, then perform two actions (whether the same or different) from these four:<br/><br/><br/>    Purchase an animal, staff, or facility card from those available on the market, then add it to your zoo.<br/>    Draw the top card from either the animal deck or the staff/facility deck, then either purchase it or discard it.<br/>    Purchase the top card of either discard pile at a discount, albeit not a card you discarded this turn.<br/>    Exchange an animal in your zoo for one of equal or lesser cost or star value in the market or on top of the discard pile.<br/><br/><br/>After you acquire a pair of animals, you receive an immediate bonus of 100. You can also earn money from event cards, with staff and facility cards granting discounts and other benefits.<br/><br/>After a certain number of rounds, the first set of award cards will appear, with the awards being handed out one by one or returned to the bottom of the event deck in case of a tie. Sample awards include most felines, most money in hand, and highest total star value. As soon as a player has collected three awards &mdash; or four awards in a two-player game &mdash; that player immediately wins. If no one wins during the first award ceremony, then complete another round of events, after which more awards will be distributed.<br/><br/>",

The paths all meet in Moscow, where the danger of a coup exists if any of those People markers makes it that far. In addition, three tracks representing the Soviet economy, media and culture greatly impact the overall situation. A card draw determines which paths and tracks move against you this turn, and the number of &quot;Efforts&quot; which you earn that you can use to move them back in your favor (if the Effort die roll succeeds). The presence of Gorbachev himself gives you additional Efforts -- but he is often on vacation!<br/><br/>Managing Efforts is key to the game, and you never have as many as you want. You can obtain more by calling in the KGB or gambling away your army in Afghanistan and Eastern Europe, and your nuclear missiles, in disarmament deals: a short term strategy that can cost you victory points in the end. You can even abandon your Warsaw Pact allies to win Western goodwill (and more Efforts) as the Cold War comes to an end. Your success at disarmament will depend on how the US President views your policies, making the 1988 election -- George H.W. Bush vs. Michael Dukakis -- important.<br/><br/>Each risky gambit is aimed at averting a military coup against you, which can end the game suddenly. Your success (or failure) in controlling the five paths of public opinion helps determine how many individual Politburo members are still on your side when a coup plot is hatched, so the better you play the game, the less chance the coup gets off the ground.<br/><br/>Can you hold the Soviet Union together long enough to achieve a treaty with your restive Republics and win the game?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The sole hope for relief from a slow and painful death lies in the hands of the plague doctors. Dressed in black cloaks, and masks stuffed with vinegar-rags and spice, the surgeons roam the Burgus streets searching for the infected. To these they offer salvation, saving their flesh from death, while gaining prestige with the princely court and &mdash; why not? &mdash; one or two shiny coins!<br/><br/>Will you prove yourselves as valorous surgeons, up to the tasks you're called to resolve? Will you expand your influence with good works, draining infected swamps and building plague hospitals? Or will you give in to the facts of life, and death, raking in whatever coins you happen to find?<br/><br/>1347 is a strategic game in which players are plague doctors with the aim of gaining as much fame and prestige as possible to become the most important of the town. Each player has resource cards, money, grave diggers, and five influence tokens at their disposal to invest in order to defeat the plague and enrich themselves. There are three stages that will repeat for three periods (that will vary from 6 to 9 game rounds):<br/><br/><br/>     Investments -&gt; Each player, turn by turn, will invest one influence token (from 0-4 influence points) in one of the six areas of the board, each one with different actions allowed. All the investments are hidden. Investments go on until all players remain with no tokens.<br/>     Actions -&gt; Starting from Area 1, all invested tokens are revealed. The player who invested the most is the only one who can exploit the actions allowed from that area. The other players who invested can convert their &quot;unused points&quot; in money or grave diggers. So losing is also a strategy. In case of tie, the first player, or the nearest one in clockwise has priority, in any case the first player will change at the end of each round.<br/>     Upkeep -&gt; In this stage players collect money from the Agrus (the country), can heal their recruited plagued commoners, or can maintain their healed commoners. Healed commoners give players new influence tokens to invest and an ability to exploit as long as they remain healed.<br/><br/><br/>There are many kind of actions players can do: recruit commoners, transform grave diggers in peasants to collect money, build expansions to enforce their influence to specific areas, etc.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the players obtain 1 wealth point (victory points) for:<br/><br/>     Each influence point (the value shown on each influence token held);<br/>     Every five coins;<br/>     Each subject card;<br/>     Each development held;<br/>     Every three gravediggers held (including the player's reserve and those assigned to the Agrus).<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

For example, there is a gambler card with target number 5 and reward amount 3.<br/><br/>After optionally hiring a new gambler, the player who begins the round plays a number card face up. For the initial round, it would be 1 or 0. Then, other players play one of their number cards face down. After that, reveal all the number cards and add up the numbers. If that total equals the number of a gambler cards, any player who hired that gambler gets the reward accordingly.<br/><br/>Play continues this way until a player collects 15 coins or more.

The dice are eight-sided, printed in full color, and about 2 inches to a side. Each die is pre-cut and scored, and assembles with just tabs and slots. The &quot;paper&quot; in these paper dice is 12-point coated cardstock, which makes these dice solid enough to withstand any amount of normal play.<br/><br/>Diceland: Space is a 50-die expansion for Diceland, which comes in two different 25-die boxes. The set introduces new abilities like Cloak, Remove, Dodge, and more, and gives players their first chance to construct customized Diceland armies. Each box contains two major armies, one smaller one, and a strange and wonderful 25th die.<br/><br/>Space: Terrans vs. Urluquai includes an 11-die Terran army, featuring a fast-moving wing of Scouts and a powerful 15-point Destroyer; the 8-die Urluquai army including both a Corvette and a Fighter with the Cloaking ability; and the 5-die Zorg army, with a fat carrier and a unique Tender which can teleport enemies off the board. Also in the Terrans vs. Urluquai box, you&rsquo;ll find the friendly Klakar Frigate, an impressive 16-point frigate that&rsquo;s a perfect addition to any army that can afford him.<br/><br/>Space: Garthans vs. Muktians includes an 11-die Garthan army, featuring both the Light and Super Carriers as well as a vast array of small Fighters; the 8-die Muktian army featuring a mix of unusual ship designs; and the 5-die Tan Ru army, featuring a powerhouse 15-point Decimator and a wing of three mindless Drones.

Everyone who voted correctly moves ahead one or three spaces on the scoring track, and the questioner moves ahead one space for each person who voted incorrectly. If you pass a certain space on the scoring track, you retrieve your 3x token (if you've used it).

The game scale is given as: 1.2 miles across per HEX; Units are Regiments up to Divisions. Complexity is rated 'Low' while Solitaire suitability is rated 'High'.<br/><br/>This is a game on the Ludendorff 'Peace Offensive' in an attempt to work the German forces between the British and French Armies. If the Germans can pull it off, then they'll force the French to fall back to defend Paris while entrapping the British against the coast, thereby forcing them to surrender. Using the tactics of the successful 'Russian' Front forces, developed by General Oskar von Hutier, the 'Stosstruppen' head off to engage the enemy while the Allies amass their 'Tank' forces for a counter-attack.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The award winning game Orcs Must Die has made its way to the table top! Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame dares you to preserve your stronghold sieged by orcs. You have traps &amp; weapons galore, and can team up with your friends to obliterate the nasty orcs and their grotesque allies.<br/><br/>Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame includes scores of figures of favorite heroes, plus hordes of orcs, crossbow orcs, kobolds, gnolls, trolls, ogres, and more. Build an exciting fortress using a tile-based system, then watch as swarms of baddies plunge through your defenses to abolish your Rift.<br/><br/>Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame  actually consists of TWO separate games! One is based on the heroic Order, while the other is for the Unchained. Both are complete stand-alone games. In Order, you&rsquo;ll play heroes such as Maximilian the War Mage, Gabriella the Redeemed Sorceress, and others, while fending off the villainous orc onslaught. In Unchained, you play opposing heroes, such as the Kobold King or Midnight the assassin, facing down assaults by human soldiers, lions, elves, bears, dwarfs, and the like.<br/><br/>How Is It Played?<br/>First, you and your friends choose your heroes &ndash; each individual game supports 1-4 players, who must co-operate to survive the enemy onslaught. Each hero has his own individual sheet, with his unique characteristics, special ability, and his secret superpower, that he needs to save for just the right moment. He also comes with his own special figure and his own weapon cards that no one else has access to.<br/><br/>When you think you are ready to go, choose a difficulty level, and a map &ndash; you can select one of the maps we&rsquo;ve included, or create one of your own! A typical map is made up of from 4 to as many as 13 tiles (or even more, if you are inventing your own design). The game has a lot of pieces to play with, but the map itself is reasonably tight, and will fit just fine on a typical gaming (or dining room) table.<br/><br/>Finally, the fight begins! Each turn, waves of orcs and other monsters move pitilessly through the map, relentlessly aiming for your poor Guardian, trying to destroy him and your Rift. You and your allies run around the map, placing traps in the various parts of your map, battling the invaders, and performing a host of other actions.<br/><br/>You earn trophy skulls for killing your enemies, and these act as the game&rsquo;s &ldquo;cash&rdquo; &ndash; spend them to buy new weapons, magic amulets, and a host of other items. You also can spend skulls to place traps, and to upgrade your Guardian, making him better-able to hold off the orcs, gnolls, and other enemies.<br/><br/>But over time your enemies accrue in strength, too! You have to face three Onslaughts, and with each Onslaught, your foes increase in might. If you do not lay a solid groundwork for your defenses with upgrades and trap placements in the early part of the game, you may face doom later on!<br/><br/>Combat is straightforward and fast &ndash; you roll various colored dice depending on what type of weapons and upgrades you own. Remove &ldquo;killed&rdquo; enemies from the map, only to see them replaced by new waves each turn. The fun continues. The game builds up over time to a crescendo of doom, in which the last few turns see you frantically try to finish off the final waves of the onslaught before your crippled Guardian is destroyed!<br/><br/>Head-to-head play?<br/>If you or your friends own both the Order and Unchained versions of Orcs Must Die: The Boardgame , you can go head-to-head, pitting the regimented Order against the legions of the Unchained in an epic conflict. You and your friends will split into two teams &ndash; one side fights for the Order, and the other will control the Unchained.<br/><br/>Each side has its own heroes, its own armies, its own Items, and its own traps. Your hero can defend your own citadel, or seek to lead your armies to victory inside the enemy lair. With friends to help, your faction can station heroes at both tasks, and even switch off duties. The game supports up to 4 players per side.<br/><br/>",

As a challenge is defeated, another takes its place, with 57 challenge cards in total. As you face the challenges of the Well, you may play a skill card from your hand only when it matches the color of the challenge card, e.g., if you're facing a red challenge card, then you may play only a red skill card. Some cards have two colors, and some are white, that is, wild. If the card you play does not defeat the challenge, you'll be able to add some progress to it and attempt it again, though you may suffer a penalty for doing so.<br/><br/>Other seekers can provide help by playing one of their own cards as a boost, but beware. Running out of cards nets you an exhaustion card before you can draw a new hand. Exhaustion cards are never good, but some are worse than others.<br/><br/>Defeating a challenge provides you a reward, such as regaining health or delving deeper into the Well, which is represented by discarding unseen challenge cards. Once you've made your way to the bottom of the Well, you'll face Scorn himself. All Seekers share a health pool, and if the pool reaches zero, you're defeated. This is a game that requires teamwork and persistence as the wells of Atios are unpredictable and quite dangerous.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

After her revolt succeeded in burning three major towns and slaughtering tens of thousands of Roman citizens and allies, the Emperor Nero seriously considered whether this distant land was worth the cost to stay. Governor G.S. Paulinus&rsquo; remarkable victory (perhaps at the location later known as &ldquo;Watling Street&rdquo;) reaffirmed Roman domination. They would remain in Britain for over 300 more years.<br/><br/>But it might have been different. Can you as the leader of a various cluster of independent Celtic tribes cause enough trouble and loss to make the Romans leave your island? Can you as the commander of scattered Roman troops snuff out the rebellion more effectively than Paulinus? Will London burn or be saved?<br/><br/>Boudicca: The Warrior Queen represents a full upgrade of the Druid: Boudicca's Rebellion, 61 A.D. game Richard H. Berg designed for West End Games over 25 years ago. Along with great counters and map art (including the period road net and location of tribal centers), you&rsquo;ll find streamlined mechanics, more involved possibilities and &ldquo;what ifs?&rdquo; - and a game driven by card play, somewhat like that used for Hammer of the Scots.<br/><br/>",

The map is broken up into irregular &quot;spaces&quot; containing land, shallow or deep sea. Land spaces may contain airbases and/or ports; sea spaces may contain standing detection patrols (SOSUS, etc).<br/><br/>Pieces are double sided cardboard of 3 different sizes (capital ships/task forces, small ships/submarines, and aircraft) with the back only giving the basic information (a formation of aircraft, a submarine silhouette or a Task Force symbol) to keep the specific information of the unit secret from the opponent. Each unit has a detection rating and an attack rating.<br/><br/>Each side starts each turn with a random number of detection attempts (2+d10 for NATO, 2+d6 for Soviet). Pieces are moved on the board (ships/subs up to 3 spaces, aircraft up to 1, 4, or 8 depending on type). As opposing pieces are moved into the same spaces, detection attempts are spent trying to locate the enemy units in the space (usually d10 &lt;= detection rating). Detected units are turned sideways so both sides can see it. Once units are found combat may be initiated.<br/><br/>Combat is done in two attack phases. Dice are rolled vs. the attack rating of the attacking unit(s) (usually 1 d10 but there are exceptions) and hits are determined and resolved simultaneously. Ships that did not fire in the first phase conduct a second attack phase. Units can be in combat if not detected but upon firing become detected (which means undetected units almost invariably shoot in the second phase). Hits are again determined. 1, 2 or 3 hits (subs, small surface ships, large surface ships) are required to destroy a unit. Aircraft are destroyed only if the hit on them was a rolled 1 or 2. Victory is determined by scenario conditions. There are several optional rules, none of which appear to significantly increase the complexity of the game.<br/><br/>",

The first major clash of arms in the western theater of the American Civil War is about to commence!<br/><br/>In Clash of Wills: Shiloh 1862, you and your opponent each control one of the opposing armies. As the Confederate player, you open the battle with a devastating surprise attack on the Union camps around Shiloh church. If you can rout the disorganized blue coats and take Pittsburg Landing before reinforcements arrives, you can deal a potentially fatal blow to the invading Yankees. As the Union player you must survive the initial onslaught and hold back the advancing rebels on the first day of battle. Then, the next day, you can deploy your full forces to crush this latest threat to the survival of the United States. Whose will prevails?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Mounted game board of the United States in 1824, 200 cards including 80 event cards describing the various events during the election and the time period.

Briefly, starting with seven columns each, on a player's turn, he may move several columns to the tail end of one existing column so as to form a new word (or the beginning of one).  The openings thus created are filled with newly drawn cards.  You score the words you built based on the consonants' values and the length of the word (multiply the consonants' total by the number of cards).  Completed words may be retired to score.  If you manage to end the game with all your letters being part of complete words, you've Balied the game and your score doubles (triples in the Aladdin edition).<br/><br/>",

Next is either the Interstate 500 or Suburban Gauntlet.  After this is the Beltway Expressway, with a Car Pool Express Lane for the lucky bastards with three or more commuters on board.  Finally, there is the Inner City Maze.<br/><br/>You normally roll two dice, but some road signs reduce that number to one die.

If the Master Builder is the only empty fist, it gets to pick from its hand. If one other player had an empty fist, they secretly pass a piece to the Master Builder. If more than one empty fist matches the Master Builder's choice, no-one builds.<br/><br/>Play continues with the next player being the Master Builder and so on until somebody clears their hand. If you still hold pieces, Towers lose you 15pts, Gates 10pts and the Walls from 1-6 pts.

Stalingrad: Verdun on the Volga is divided into several two-player scenarios (based on the historical German offensives in September and October). The game enables you to re-fight one of the most important battles of World War II in a single evening (a victory point check at the mid-way point that can keep games under three hours) using Rinella's favorite area impulse game system.<br/><br/>- Turns represent four days of historical time.<br/>- The unit scale is roughly regimental, with some battalion-sized formations, versus battalion scale with some company-sized formations.<br/>- Only three units types - infantry, armor, and pioneer.<br/>- An accurate modeling of German combat attrition. Based on most recent publications utilizing post-Cold War Soviet sources (primarily Glantz).<br/><br/>",

Each round, players roll their individual pools of dice, then decide what area of the city they want to focus on trying to capture. Meanwhile, the current Don is able to make players an offer they can't refuse and steal dice from their limited supply. Staying on top proves difficult as every stolen die moves other players up the ladder toward taking over as Don, so the tension rises with each shake of the dice.<br/><br/>With multiple ways to use each die you roll, players never find themselves at the mercy of the dice, instead using what they roll to make their opponents beg for mercy.<br/><br/>",

They always say the suburbs have it better, right? They weren't hit nearly as hard; we've found a sturdy house. It still has a roof and everything. We're hungry, tired, and it's a struggle to hold back the dead from their nightly assaults, but we're still here, we're not going down yet.&quot;<br/><br/>Zpocalypse 2: Defend The Burbs is a standalone tower defense-style game, evolved from the original Zpocalypse, a survival board game set in a post-apocalyptic wasteland.<br/><br/>Like the original, two to five players each control their own squad of survivors equipped to the teeth with weapons, food, and items. In this game, your actions as squad leader allow the survivors to choose their tasks on the daily action board. Each choice has limited space and will come with benefits (potential for more supplies) and costs (like all things in the Zpocalypse, it's never pleasant!)<br/><br/>With gained experience, your survivors level up on a variety skills. Rather than picking your path for you as in the original game, now you have the ability to carve out your survival scenario for yourself, but be careful what you wish for.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The eternal war, the Meeple War, is over for a while now. The meeples are free and live happily in their land. (Note: Its location is being kept a secret as you surely understand.) But that dream world is now troubled... Humans have discovered it and are kidnapping meeples to force them to work in their boardgames. There are only two possible outcomes: Fight the humans, as hard as that would be for the tiny meeples, or build rockets to leave for a new and peaceful planet!<br/><br/>Leading your meeples, you will use trains that lead to different places in which you'll be able to enroll new meeples, repair your wounded foes, acquire resources, build rockets, and fight humans. But be prepared: Your glory will depend on the outcome of the end of the game. If the humans succeed in invading the meeple world before you can escape with the rockets, the one who fought the best will be rewarded; if not, the one who most helped the escape will be. Choose your side wisely!<br/><br/>Save the Meeples is a worker placement game in which placement is disconnected from action, so you have to program your placement in a certain order, but you will take actions in reverse order.<br/>What's more, the winning conditions differ greatly depending on how the game ends ( fight or fly !), under the control of the players, not chance.<br/><br/>",

Two special forces camps, a handful of elite soldiers, and thirty miles of rugged, jungled terrain were all that stood between the onrushing NVA and their objective, the strategic town of Pleiku. The NVA quickly surrounded and besieged the camps, threatening a quick and easy victory over the outnumbered II Corps defenders. Desperate to hold back the tide of Communist soldiers, the South Vietnamese commander asked the U.S. for help.<br/><br/>The newly formed 1st Cavalry Division, fresh in country and bivouacked at nearby An Khe, rushed to the aid of the beleaguered garrisons. With its complement of over 400 combat helicopters, the 1st Cav was completely airmobile. While the helicopter's mobility guaranteed quick movement and ready resupply, it did not guarantee victory. The soldiers that the unblooded Americans faced were tough, well trained veterans. Victory would not come easily for the Americans.<br/><br/>Between October 23 and November 25, 1965, a desperate struggle between a full North Vietnamese Army Division and the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division took place west of Pleiku in Vietnam's Central Highlands.

        "description": "Note: The cardlist shows a card with the name Nightmare Fuel. The card was renamed Blood Transfusion, but the cardlist was not updated. You have the correct cards, though.<br/><br/>Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Adventure Time Card Wars is the most epic card game ever found in the Land of Ooo, or anywhere for that matter! In the Adventure Time episode &quot;Card Wars&quot;, Jake begs Finn to play his favorite trading card game. Finn accepts, despite warnings from Beemo on how very competitive Jake can be while playing the game. Finn and Jake battle against each other to decide who will be the Dweeb and who will be the Cool Guy.<br/><br/>Now fans can play the actual Card Wars game in Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, with all of the action taking place in four combat lanes.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player has two Action Points to spend on Creatures, Spells, and Locations, and cards cost between 0 and 2 Action Points to play. When you summon a Creature, you choose which lane you want to place it in; some Creatures have FLOOP abilities that allow you to use their special abilities. When you attack with a Creature down a lane, you might find an opposing Creature, or you might get to deal your damage straight to your opponent's Hit Points. Reduce your opponent's Hit Points from 25 to 0 and you're the Cool Guy (and you win the game)!<br/><br/>In Adventure Time Card Wars: Ice King vs. Marceline, which contains all new cards other than a few rainbow card repeats, the Ice King and his IcyLands deck take on Marceline's dark and crafty Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck. IcyLands creatures are all about attacking directly. They would prefer to avoid attacking other creatures. One way they can find some clear lanes to attack down is through frozen tokens. Through various means, these chilling tokens can be placed onto your opponent's Landscapes. Opponents will find playing creatures onto frozen landscapes rather difficult. Where the Ice King finds an opening, he will strike as hard as a blizzard!<br/><br/>Marceline's deck is a Useless Swamps &amp; NiceLands deck. This is the first time that NiceLands has been paired with another landscape type, and the chemistry is going to burn hot! The Useless Swamp side of the deck is themed around denial, discard, and dirty tricks. Some of the Useless Swamp Creatures are willing victims to your dark tidings. When they go, they leave a lot of destruction in their wake. The NiceLands side of the deck is themed around creatures with exactly five damage on them. This is a tweak to the NiceLands strategy as seen in the original NiceLands deck. There, the creatures thrived with various different amounts of damage on them. Now the trick is to get as many of your creatures as you can to have exactly five damage on them. When that happens, look out!<br/><br/>Each Card Wars starter set has a pair of different forty-card decks and is ready to play right out of the box. Mix the decks together to come up with your own righteous combos!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from VaeVictis website:)<br/><br/>On his way to the Holy Land, Richard Coeur de Lion (the Lionheart) arrived at Cyprus. The ruler of the island, Isaac Dukas Comnenus, tried unsuccessfully to repel the Crusaders&rsquo; landing before falling back to Nicosia to regroup his forces. Once assured of the safety of his fleet, Richard set off into the interior of the island. Isaac marched against him, hoping to confront him in a vast plain favorable to the maneuvers of the redoubtable Byzantine cavalry. The clash occurred near the village of Tremithousa on May 21, 1191. The cavalry charges were horrendous and for a time the issue was in doubt, but the Anglo-Normans&rsquo; heavy knights finally prevailed. Isaac was captured, and this caused the Greeks to rout. Richard, now in control of Cyprus, could resume his journey to the Holy Land.<br/>He joined Philip Augustus at Saint Jean d&rsquo;Acre, which fell on July 12. When Philip returned to France, Richard gained sole command of the Crusader army. He marched south with the intention of liberating Jerusalem, but on September 7, 1194, Saladin attacked the Christians as they made their way down the coast. Showered with arrows, the Hospitaliers launched a premature charge, forcing Richard to give the signal for a general attack. After a violent counterattack, Saladin&rsquo;s troops were finally vanquished by one last charge of the Crusaders. Richard the Lionheart soon reconquered the coastlands, after which he negotiated an agreement with Saladin which allowed pilgrims free access to Jerusalem.<br/><br/>Tremithousa and Arsuf 1191 are the 31st and 32nd battles of the series Au fil de l&rsquo;&eacute;p&eacute;e / By the Edge of the Sword, launched in issue 26 of the magazine Vae Victis. The game includes two battles won by Richard the Lionheart during the course of the Third Crusade, the first battle being fought on Cyprus against Isaac Comnenus and the second in the Holy Land against Saladin.<br/><br/>Le Lion et l'Ep&eacute;e / The Lion &amp; the Sword includes :<br/><br/>    two 59 x 40 cm maps (one sheet backprinted), <br/>    216 double-sided die-cut counters and markers, <br/>    rules and scenarios booklet <br/>    player-aid card in color.<br/><br/><br/>Units : 1 strength point per 100 combatants<br/>Map scale : 250 m/hex.<br/>Turn : 30 minutes<br/>Complexity : 6/9<br/><br/><br/>Battles: Tremetousia (Cyprus, May 21 1191) and Arsuf (Holy Land, September 7 1191).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Knights of the Round Table must assemble once again to protect King Arthur's kingdom from numerous threats. But wait &ndash; these aren't the knights of old, but rather their children. Can these newcomer knights prove up to the task of tracking the dangers out there and putting a stop to them before it's too late?<br/><br/>In Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game, the players (mostly) work together to complete quests before the danger level of a quest gets too high.<br/><br/>In game terms, the quests are represented by five types of cards, with each card showing 1-3 swords, as well as a number from 2 to 5 or a question mark. These cards are shuffled together with Morgan le Fay cards (which curse the players when they appear) and Merlin cards (which remove some aspects of the curse) to form the rumor deck. Each player receives a secret loyalty card at the start of the game, with at most one person being a traitor to the cause. On a turn a player either:<br/><br/><br/>    Reveals a rumor card.<br/>    Attempts a quest.<br/>    Accuses a knight.<br/><br/><br/>To reveal a rumor card, the player flips it onto the top of the revealed stack of cards. If it's a quest card, players try to keep track of the total value of cards from that quest, with ?s each worth as many points as the number of ?s revealed of that quest. If a Morgan le Fay is revealed, players can no longer speak to one another; in addition, Morgan twists the values of some cards or removes some from play. Merlin allows players to speak once again.<br/><br/>Players are trying to stop quests when the total value is 11, 12 or 13. Any lower, and they arrived too soon, wasting time; any higher, and they arrived too late. To attempt a quest, the player points to the top quest card and says, &quot;It's time.&quot; The player then reveals all cards in the deck. If the sum of that quest is 11-13, then the players receive 1-3 white swords, as shown on the quest cards. If lower, they receive one black sword; if higher, 1-3 black swords. All other quests are checked to see whether the players were too late, then the stack resets. A failed quest rewards the attempter with a special bonus card for later use.<br/><br/>Once three swords have been claimed, whatever the color, a player can choose to accuse another player of being traitorous to the cause, winning a reward if correct and a penalty otherwise. If the players collect seven white swords, they have stopped Morgan's forces and win. If, however, they collect seven black swords first, then Arthur's kingdom falls.<br/><br/>Reimplements<br/><br/>    Shadows over Camelot<br/><br/><br/>",

It contains 8 pages of full-colour images in the centre, a weapon summary and quick reference sheet at the end. The combat rules and shooting were identical to those of Necromunda. The much more complex nature of the rules meant that games were intended to be played on a much smaller scale than the current Warhammer 40,000 rules.<br/><br/>Box Contents:<br/><br/>Game rules and background:<br/>Warhammer 40,000 Rulebook<br/>Warhammer 40,000 Wargear (weapons and wargear rules}<br/>Warhammer 40,000 Codex lmperialis (background for game factions plus rules for different units/characters}<br/>Warhammer 40,000 Codex army lists<br/>Warhammer 40,000 Battle for Armageddon scenarios (scenarios that make use of boxed game miniatures}<br/>Warhammer 40,000 How to paint your models<br/>How to play Warhammer 40,000 (a &lsquo;getting started&rsquo; run through of the rules)<br/>Warhammer 40,000 Rules summery card<br/>Warhammer 40,000 Weapons summery card<br/><br/>Miniatures:<br/>20 Orks (bolt pistol and axe)<br/>40 Gretchin (autogun)<br/>1 cardboard Ork dreadnought and stand<br/>2 Space Marine Sergeants (bolt pistol and chainsword)<br/>2 Space Marines with flamers<br/>2 Space Marines with rocket launchers<br/>14 Space Marines with bolters<br/><br/>Vehicle Datafaxes:<br/>1 Space Marine Rhino<br/>1 Space Marine Dreadnought<br/>1 Space Marine Predator<br/>1 Space Marine Land Raider<br/>1 Space Ork Dreadnought<br/>1 Space Ork Battlewagon<br/><br/>Wargear Cards:<br/>1 Bionic Eye<br/>1 Combi-weapon<br/>1 Conversion Field<br/>1 Displacer Field<br/>1 Firepike<br/>2 Haywire Grenades<br/>1 Retractor Field<br/>1 Scanner<br/>2 Vortex Grenades<br/>1 Web Of Skulls<br/><br/>Mission Cards (one of each pair is green and the other is blue):<br/>2 &lsquo;Engage and Destroy&rsquo; mission cards<br/>2 &lsquo;The Assassins&rsquo; mission cards<br/>2 &lsquo;Dawn Raid&rsquo; mission cards<br/>2 &lsquo;Take and Hold&rsquo; mission cards<br/><br/>Play aids:<br/>20 cardboard ruins<br/>3 squad references cards (1 Space Marine, 1 Ork, 1 Gretchin)<br/>Victory point record chart<br/>1 vehicle turning template<br/>1 Thudgun template (made of four connected 1&rdquo; blast templates)<br/>1 blast template &mdash; 1&quot;<br/>1 blast template &mdash; 1.5&quot;<br/>1 blast template &mdash; 2&quot;<br/>1 blast template &mdash; 3&quot;<br/>2 vortex templates &mdash; 1.5&quot;<br/>1 hand flamer template<br/>1 flamer template<br/>1 heavy flamer template<br/><br/>",

The Five Points area of New York in the mid-1800s was a lurid geographical cancer filled with dilapidated and unlivable tenement houses, gang extortion, corrupt politicians, dance halls and drunkenness and gambling. This was a place where all manner of crime flourished, the residents were terrorized and squalor prevailed. This is the setting over many decades through the nineteenth century.<br/><br/>Five Points: Gangs of New York is a game of struggle for political control of Manhattan in the mid-19th century. As the leader of a powerful political faction, you manipulate gangs and influence politicians behind the scenes to seize control. Effective use of your resources will gain influence, win elections, and let you control the destiny of New York; fail and you will be less than a footnote to history.<br/><br/>Several tools lie at your disposal if you have the strength to acquire and use them. Your loyal rabble will execute your will. Controlling districts with your rabble could give you access to a limited number of important buildings: Tammany Hall, Board of Elections, 5th Ward Offices and many others. Your control of these buildings may provide influence and special powers. Bid for control of election-influencing manipulations that may swing the vote.<br/><br/>In Manhattan, your burgeoning political machine may affect politics in America's great city for over 100 years. At the heart of this machine are the gangs of New York who enforce the will of the bosses and determine elections before the first vote is cast.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hard Vacuum is a sci-fi space combat game based in a fictional World War II. The players take on the roles of pilots from either the U.S. Space Corps or the German Raummacht in about a dozen well balanced scenarios spanning from around 1942 to 1945. The game requires you to supply the playing surface (the rules are designed for either a hex field or a completely free form field) and the dice (which ideally should read 0-5 instead of 1-6). The counters are supplied on a laminated piece of paper roughly the same quality as the cover of the book, you must cut them out.<br/><br/>Each turn begins with each player secretly marking down how much thrust they are applying to which thrusters on their ships. These are simultaneously revealed, and thrust markers are added/removed as needed. Because space is a vacuum, thrust applied in one direction will mean you go in that direction until you compensate for it!<br/><br/>The next part of the turn is the combat phase. Players must roll the dice to determine if they can still see their opponent. If they can see their enemy can they shoot. All the players fire their weapons simultaneously, and then they apply the results of hits and criticals at the same time. The turn is now complete.<br/><br/>There are significant technological differences between the American and German spacecraft. The German craft are generally more powerful, but have a limited supply of fuel and weapons, while the American craft are weaker, but their fuel and weapons supply automatically recharges each turn.<br/><br/>Hard Vacuum is aimed at any fan of classic sci-fi, dogfight, or space combat games. It has a lighter, almost comic book quality in its setting and the game does not get bogged down by complex rules or mechanics. Once the game mechanics are mastered (which does not take long), a complete game can be played in under an hour.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     Hard Vacuum: Science Gone Mad<br/>     Hard Vacuum: War's End<br/><br/><br/>",

For the ghosts, the goal is to inflict at least &pound;45,000 of damage (in tribute to Special 45 &ndash; Old Faydhutee Single Malt) on the manor, whether it is inflicted by the ghosts or the hunters. The ghost hunters want to stop the ghosts before they achieve their objective.<br/><br/>The dual-level game board represents a manor floor composed of 36 rooms, with each room being a tile representing a value from &pound;1,000 to &pound;6,000; each of the four ghosts corresponds to a room type and will hide beneath a tile of this type, starting its devastation of the hotel by removing tiles adjacent to the one it's hidden beneath. The ghost hunters must try to determine where the ghosts are hiding based upon the tiles destroyed. While doing this, though, the ghost hunters will also remove tiles &ndash; thus destroying them and adding to the total damage &ndash; to see whether a ghost is hidden beneath.<br/><br/>The ghost hunters must think carefully and logically over which tiles to remove while the ghosts have to use cunning and psychology in order to cloud their investigation and remain concealed. Will the manor come through this madness intact?<br/><br/>",

The game system incorporates a number of concepts from two of the highly playable games on the same subject: Bitter Woods by The Avalon Hill Game Company and the iconic battalion level Wacht am Rhein from SPI in 1977. In addition, the command and control concepts devised for the TAHGC version of The Siege of Jerusalem were utilized.<br/><br/>The Divisional compositions include HQ, the front line battalions and the combat support battalions: recon, engineers, anti-tank, anti-aircraft and artillery. The individual field battalions perform game functions that attempt to simulate the battlefield actions of their real-life models. The aircraft squadrons include those that were most numerous over the battlefield in December 1944: P47, B26, ME109, JU88 and ME262.<br/><br/>The game map is at the scale of one hex equals a mile and was developed using the 1-50,000 1943-1944 GSGS 4040 and GSGS 4507 topographical maps. Players will easily recognize the influence of the Bitter Woods game map as terrain is easily recognized and differentiated.<br/><br/>Game concepts include: HQ activation status (active or resting), fatigue and exhaustion, command and control, formation supply, supply by air, German fuel shortages, American supply dumps,  ground conditions, atmospheric conditions, air strafing and interdiction, construction of defensive positions and bridges, demolition, sacrosanct formation boundaries, limited winter movement across rivers and streams, strategic movement, infiltration due to limited visibility, over-run of vulnerable units, German night combat advantage, Kampfgruppe Peiper Breakout, German Nebelwerfer Operations, German FA Operations, Allied FA Operations, Time on Target, terrain effects for ground combat, weapons effects on ground combat, exploitation after combat, etc.<br/><br/>5 full size game maps (65&quot; x 48&quot; total playing area); 12 counter sheets (2304 playing pieces).<br/><br/>Time Scale: 4 turns per day.<br/>Map Scale: 1 mile per hex.<br/>Ground Unit Scale: Battalion.<br/>Air Unit Scale: 25 aircraft per counter.<br/>Number of Players: 2 to 5.<br/>Solitaire suitability: 6 out of 9.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Roll dice as in Ancient Rome, trying to form the highest possible Roman numerals from your results. But don't be too quick to roll for the highest value because &quot;Alea iacta est&quot;; the dice might no longer form a valid Roman numeral. What's more, the results you roll must be placed in ascending order on the scoresheet.<br/><br/>In R&ouml;misch Pokern, each player gets six action cards. On your turn, you first roll a die. After each roll, you must decide whether to stop or to continue by rolling an additional die. You may continue to roll as long as your results can still form a Roman numeral. If you end your turn with a valid number, this number is noted in your column of the scoresheet. You can decide in which of the seven rows the number gets written. The only restrictions are that the numbers must be in ascending order from top to bottom, and you cannot repeat a number.<br/><br/>If you rolled an invalid number, or the number is already in your column of the scoresheet, your turn ends. All is not lost, though! You can still use your action cards to turn a bad roll into a good one; however, you must make this choice carefully because each action card still unused at the end of the game provides bonus points! The game ends when someone has seven numbers in their column of the scoresheet, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A tower building game.<br/><br/>Jenga is played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.<br/><br/>Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.<br/><br/>The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top. The loser is the person who made the tower fall (i.e. whose turn it was when the tower fell); the winner is the person who moved before the loser.<br/><br/>The same game concept was published in 1984 by Fagus under the name &quot;Hoppla - eins zuviel!&quot;<br/><br/>According to the designer, the game was developed from Takoradi blocks/bricks. &quot;Jenga&quot; is Swahili for &quot;build&quot;.<br/><br/>",

In Doodle Dungeon, each player works on their own dungeon blueprint. Drafted cards determine which elements &mdash; monsters, traps, and treasures &mdash; they have to add immediately. After fourteen cards have been drafted, the blueprint is passed to the next player, who then draws the route an anthropomorphic test hero will take because these days, even in the dungeon business, nothing works without quality inspection. The players receive their own blueprints back and try to keep the dummy hero from killing their monsters, stealing their treasures, and &mdash; obviously &mdash; making it out alive. They can use the drafted cards to fight off the hero or to support the heroes in their opponent's dungeons. In the end, only the creator of the most devious dungeon will triumph.<br/><br/>Doodle Dungeon combines the rewarding elements of creating, then defending one's own dungeon, and mixes it with engaging draft-and-draw gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NHL Ice Breaker is licensed by the National Hockey League and features the league&rsquo;s 30 teams plus national teams. You get all the great action of the game on the ice with NHL Ice Breaker. Game play is built around CSE Games' specially-designed 54-card playing deck (52 standard suited cards plus two Jokers). Each action in NHL Ice Breaker is based on the basic principle of high hand wins. Opponents play their card(s) at the same time to battle for puck possession, and the player with the highest hand gets to execute his/her action indicated on the card(s) played.<br/><br/>As players win hands, the puck is moved up the ice (game board) and toward the opponent's net. Along the way, players may land on special &ldquo;Ice Breaker&rdquo; squares, which can shift momentum in an instant. Ice Breaker actions include penalties, big hits, turnovers or great passes. Once in the Shooting Zone, it's a classic contest of shooter versus goalie. Did you play your cards right?<br/><br/>NHL Ice Breaker separates itself from other hockey-based games in that it has a true hockey 'feel'. The game is both accurate and fast-paced. Combining elements of popular card games, players must decide how best to play their cards. Cards can be played individually, in pairs, two pair, or three-of-a-kind. It is up to the player to decide which cards to play and how to play them.<br/><br/>The learning curve of NHL Ice Breaker is remarkably low. Typically, the game is learned within a couple of minutes, aided by the built-in familiarity that the playing deck offers. NHL Ice Breaker is designed for one to four players, ages eight (8) and up.<br/><br/>For more information, check out <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.csegames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.csegames.com</a>.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Game simulates the legendary world of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Barsoom. Players are involved in Barsoomian epics in the role of one hero or one of his companions, and strive to perform as nobly as those heroes of the past. There are evil villains to be met, Martian wildlife to be tamed, great treasures unique to Barsoom to be gained and lovely lasses to be wooed and won.<br/><br/>Players do not strive for victory points, but for greater glory, high romance and their attendant acclaim.<br/><br/>There are two major parts to the game, the Dueling game and the strategic game. Man-to-man combat, and then the campaign type game (Strategic) where players take on the roles of heroes and villains, a delicate blend of negotiation and action is needed to succeed in this sci-fi epic.<br/><br/>",
