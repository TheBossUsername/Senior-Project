        "description": "In Gter Ma, you play one of two sides: a thief who is trying to steal a gter ma (an ancient Tibetan Buddhist teaching) from a monastery or the lone monk who is trying to protect it with the help of his trusty, if a bit senile, Tibetan mastiff.<br/><br/>If you play as the thief, you&rsquo;ll be trying to sneak through the tall grasses into the monastery in the dead of night when the monks are all asleep, tiptoe past the guard dog who isn&rsquo;t as vigilant as he used to be, and steal the gter ma from inside. Then, you&rsquo;ll sneak back out and sell those sacred teachings for as much as possible on the open market.<br/><br/>If you play as the monk, you&rsquo;ll be trying to stop the thief from making it into the monastery by laying traps<br/>on the front lawn. Being a devout pacifist, though, none of your traps will harm the thief - but they will make enough noise to rouse the attention of your very old guard dog, who will then fiercely protect the door, making entrance impossible.<br/><br/>Download the game for free here: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://bit.ly/121IEBx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://bit.ly/121IEBx</a><br/><br/>",

The last crew to stop here didn&rsquo;t make it off the island, and their treasure is just lying out in the open for the taking.<br/><br/>Luckily, you have a good apothecary on board, and he&rsquo;s able to compound an antidote for you. of course, like any good pirate apothecary, he&rsquo;ll give you one for free to get you started, but the rest are going to cost you. So, off you head to Scorpion&rsquo;s Cove to seek your treasure. The bold will get more gold - but they&rsquo;ll also get stung more. The cautious may not be injured, but they won&rsquo;t make nearly as much. Choose wisely...<br/><br/>On each player's turn, he or she may draw any number of cards from the deck. If a player encounters three or more scorpion cards, he'll be stung - and without Antidote cards to cover the stings, he'll have to be carried back to the ship by his crewmates, who'll take all of his treasure while he's unconscious. The player with the most treasure at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

Extort conquered regions between missions or send raiding parties in search of valuable and elusive Artefacts.<br/><br/>We Are Darkness can be played in its default Campaign Mode over multiple sessions or in the Free Play Mode, allowing the players to choose a set of objectives and face the challenges of a single, longer quest providing them with an opportunity to try different ability and equipment loadouts.<br/><br/>In We Are Darkness no two sessions will ever be the same, as every mission (both in the Campaign and in the Free Play Mode) is generated using a random set of locations and enemies. As your Characters grow in power, the defenders of Elsemore learn new tricks to stand ever more valiantly against the coming Darkness.<br/><br/>A simple but robust combat and magic system, a strong tactical aspect, and an immersive, gritty story &ndash; all that and much more await you in We Are Darkness, a true resurrection of the classic cooperative dungeon-crawl experience.<br/><br/>",

(Modern Armored Conflicts) is a tactical land-combat simulation that covers (at least initially) the 1970s Central<br/>Front with the US, USSR, UK, and FRG forces well represented. The game scale is 3 minutes/turn, 250m per hex. The 'standard' unit is the Platoon, but individual squads, sections, or vehicles may be used as well (these are called 'Elements' in the game). The goal of the game design is to allow a game with up to 1 (or possibly 2) Battalions on each side but keep a sufficient level of detail that each major-caliber round fired is accounted for. The maps provided are based upon real locations in the Northern / Central German theatre covered by the game.<br/><br/>The basic counter represents a Platoon; each platoon has a number of Strength Points equal to the number of squads or<br/>vehicles in that platoon. The game system allows one to account for each major-caliber round fired without requiring<br/>the tedious book-keeping that often occurs in such detailed-level games.<br/><br/>GAME CONTENTS:<br/><br/>1 x Rules Manual (~50 pages), 12 x Color Cardstock Reference Sheets, 10 x full-color Map Sheets (each 11&quot; x 17&quot;) (some<br/>maps are geomorphic, some are stand-alone), 2 x Ten-Sided Die, 1 x CD-ROM with &gt; 200 user-printable Unit Data-Record<br/>Sheets / off-board Artillery Record Sheets / and Bonus Materials, 2 x 1/2&quot; Counter Sheets (560 counters total), 12<br/>Scenarios included with guidelines on how to create your own.<br/><br/>",

RAL uses an activation point system coupled with an Active-Reactive player status to activate the models.<br/><br/>However, each turn the players need to try and &lsquo;steal the initiative&rsquo; by betting some of their teams activations.<br/><br/>Win the bet and you steal the initiative for that turn, lose the bet and you find yourself on the back foot, having to try and react to the opponents moves in the hope you can hold them&nbsp; back long enough to steal the initiative back next turn!<br/><br/>The Active-Reactive player system brings with it the fluidity of the sports pitch to your gaming table! The players take it in turns to activate a model but being the reactive player means your players on are on the backfoot and the opponent can run run straight past you before you can muster you defences and stop the rush towards your goal zones!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Decampment is a free roam survival board game in which you and up to three other players battle the Esoteric Order of Dagon and each other while collecting four keys in order to escape from the town of Innsmouth. Decampment is the first game to be released by F Squared Game, an upcoming tabletop game company created by two friends who were inspired by the works of H.P. Lovecraft and want to keep the competitive spirit alive between family and friends. F Squared games has been working on Decampment for a little over a year before launching. Enlisting the help of family, friends, and fellow board game enthusiast for countless hours of play testing to ensure it is an enjoyable, simple and affordable game for everyone.<br/><br/>Decampment is a very simple game, unlike most other RPG style games. It is very easy to understand and anyone is able to play. Most aspects of the game are determined by the roll of only one die. We wanted to keep this game simple because we find it harder to enjoy, let alone finish, the more complex games and tired of reading large rulebooks before even attempting to play the game.<br/>Here is a brief overview of the main parts of the game. <br/>-Movement around the Board: Roll a die and you're on your way, you are able to move any one of the four directions throughout your move as long as you don't touch the same space twice in one move.<br/>-Battling with Hood Cards: Hood Cards have an attack and defense number listed right on the card. To win the battle, you simply have to roll one die a higher number that the card's listed defense number. If you fail to do so, the attack number on the card comes into play. The difference of your roll and the attack number is the amount of life points you lose.<br/>-Dueling with other players: Very similar to facing the hood cards, but both players have one die and roll against each other. The difference in the rolls is the amount of life points the defeated player loses.<br/>-Weapon Cards: Weapons are very helpful and are taken from hood cards if you successfully defeat them. They modify your attack rolls by adding the fixed number listed on the weapon card and work against hood cards as well as dueling with other players.<br/><br/>",

This supplement by Richard Clarke presents us with twenty-one scenarios for I Ain't Been Shot Mum from D-Day itself. Focussing on the US beaches (a Commonwealth version is to follow) it looks at both the amphibious forces and those airborne troops who held the line around St-Mere-Eglise. Some scenarios are linked, others are stand alone, but together they form a patchwork of actions that bring to life the heroism and desperation of that day.<br/><br/>",

The seven types of mana are: Fire, Ice, Earth, Thunder, Light, Dark, and Arcane.<br/><br/>In Mana Wars, players each start with a beginning deck of cards and draft different cards based upon the mana types that they channel. As the game goes on, your mage will change considerably.<br/><br/>The 3 types of cards in Mana Wars are Spells, Reactions and Augments, and Aspects. Spells are cards that are cast on your turn, while reactions and augments affect spells or aspects that are being cast. Aspects are powerful defensive enchantments that allow your mage to gather mana to increase their power.<br/><br/>Each round, players are able to do a variety of actions with the main goal of killing the other players. Players can either move and cast a spell or aspect card, move further if no spell is cast, or they may channel mana, allowing them to purchase new spell and aspect cards.<br/><br/>",

It was designed to offer players a simple combat system for resolving large fleet actions between opposing starship forces within a reasonable block of time. T&amp;T can also be used to resolve battles from a campaign setting.<br/><br/>In 2041 an alien space ship crashes in Washington state. Using that technology the USA develops humanity's first starships. In the meantime a cold war is brewing between the US and its allies and China and her allies. Habitable planets are discovered and in 2050 the exodus from humanity's cradle is on with the colonization of New Earth. Planets controlled by China and her allies secede from Earth and in 2126 Worlds War III begins. The Earth based states claim neutrality in the war. In 2128 with the war still unresolved an alien Starfleet attacks and captures Earth. With a tenuous truce arranged, the relief of Earth begins. The human fleets engage a new foe.<br/><br/>The game manual includes rules on movement, sensors, tachyon guns, torpedoes, probes, fighters, point defense, armor, tow beams, damage resolution and more. The rule book includes guidance for customization and the creation of your own ships. Four combat scenarios are included.<br/><br/>Also included in the rule book are a number of items designed to be photocopied for play. These include ship fleets, torpedoes, fighter squadrons, ship design forms, ship log forms (both long and short) as well as several charts and tables. The game is played with stand D6 dice (a minimum of three are required).<br/><br/>A line of 1/2400 starships model kits in plastic were created by Detailed Casting Products.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "I-GR-Making is a dodgy trick-taking game with an idol group theme. From a deck of 24 cards, players draw 1-5 cards each to use for the trick-taking. The cards that remain in the deck decide how many rounds the game will last, and what rule each round will follow: highest wins, lowest wins, etc.<br/><br/>Once the deck is finished, the game ends. Each player scores as many points as the cards of the color he has the most of, minus the value of the rest of his cards. This method of scoring, combined with the fact that having a small hand gives the player advantages, makes for a pretty weird game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Trenches of the Great War is a strategy board game set during the grind of trench warfare in World War One.  Two-to-four players are pitted against one another as one of the four main powers on the Western Front.  You will command both common and specialist troops from the armies of Britain and France or Germany and Austro-Hungary, including soldiers distinctly unique to each.<br/><br/>Every play-through will be different.  Hazards are deployed before the start of each match, including barbed wire and craters.  The mechanics for every weapon is distinctly different.  The Maxim and Vickers guns will chew an arc across the board.  Snipers will pick off single targets daring or foolish enough to step up to the edge of their trench.  Riflemen will make their slow, bolt-action attacks or grapple in melee combat with bayonets and hand-to-hand weapons until one comes out the survivor.<br/><br/>Combat outcomes, be they melee or ranged, will be decided with alterable randomness.  The default chances to hit are decided between the unit&rsquo;s skill and cards drawn from the deck.  Each player is dealt a new hand of cards at the start of each of the eight turns.  First the attacker has the opportunity to influence an event where the random card drawn is not in their favor.  The player can choose the card best suited from their hand to turn it in their favor.  In return, the defender can then counter, if they so choose, with a better suited card they choose from their own hand.  This influencing with cards can go back and forth until one player runs out of cards or decides they have expended enough.  It will be a bloody day along the trench.  Will it be that of your soldiers or the enemy&rsquo;s?<br/><br/>Adding to the replay potential are the missions that players will be issued to complete.  Players could be tasked to capture and hold locations in the dangerous No Man&rsquo;s Land, to make hazardous excursions to retrieve pilots and the film from downed biplanes, or even going Over the Top to seize the enemy&rsquo;s trench.  Each of these missions, and others, change the nature of the experience.  The tactics to cover a sortie to a biplane won&rsquo;t work to invade the enemy&rsquo;s trench.  How to place machine guns for maximum effect, when and where to bombard the enemy with poison gas, and where to drive a charge of riflemen towards are all in the player&rsquo;s power.  Wise tactics will mean the difference between success and yet another bloodbath.  It will take more than firepower to live through the day.  Each commander will need cunning, thoughtfulness, and a patience to time their attacks and defenses to best effect.<br/><br/>",

In about 15 minutes, you will have a final score, shots on goal, goal scorers, full goalie stats, and full stats for a about three or four selected skaters.<br/><br/>Every player has an offense rating and defense rating.  Each period, you choose two forward lines and one defensive pairing from each team.  You compare each player's OFF and DEF rating to come to an overall rating.  Use that rating along with a roll of the dice to determine how many shots are taken that period.  Then roll on the goalie's card to see how many of those shots were let thru.<br/><br/>After the game goes final, you can then roll for stat lines of a few selected players.  Stats kept are goals, assists, SOG, and PIM.  Since you already know the shots and goal totals, you can already generate a full stat line for the goalie.  I'll also provide a chart to allocate any other goals scored to be able to list who scored the goals (regardless if you want to track that player or not)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets is a dual layered game that features a simplified method in which games can be completed in 20 minutes and an advanced game in which a game with full stats will take about an hour. Neither version will require constant external chart look ups or other methods that can slow down a game&rsquo;s pace. With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets all of the action comes from each team&rsquo;s rating sheet.<br/><br/>Let me stress that this is NOT a quick play game. All action is resolved possession-by-possession, just as in real basketball. With the simplified method, you are tracking only the team&rsquo;s score and fouls which allows for quicker game times. However, you&rsquo;ll still visually see why a team wins or loses. With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets each team&rsquo;s card is formulated to accurately replicate all aspects of a team&rsquo;s play. Each team is rated offensively for field goal percentage, three point shooting, propensity to commit turnovers, ability to get open shots, propensity to commit offensive fouls, free throw shooting, offensive rebounding, and ability to hit contested shots. On the defensive side, each team is rated for their ability to contest shots, propensity to commit fouls, ability to force turnovers, defensive rebounding ability, and two point and three point field goal percentage allowed.<br/><br/>Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets also features a unique Power System that incorporates strength of schedule as well as home court advantage. With the Power System you can accurately match-up power house teams against the cupcakes and be assured that the results will mirror real life.<br/><br/>The advanced game features all of the above, but also brings individual players into the mix. Every player for every team is accurately rated to perform as they did in the college basketball season. Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets features a unique system that doesn&rsquo;t require manual substitutions on the part of the gamer. This system means that you don&rsquo;t have to track player minutes or other minutia for realistic performances. With Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets every player will perform as they did during the college season. You&rsquo;ll have nights where your starters are &ldquo;off&rdquo; and nights where a bench player provides a spark, leading your team to victory.<br/><br/>And while the substitutions are handled within the game engine, don&rsquo;t think that coaching decisions were left out. As the coach, you decide when to implement the full-court press. You&rsquo;ll decide when to &ldquo;sag&rdquo; to stop the opponent&rsquo;s inside game or stretch your defense to pressure the perimeter shooters. On offense you decide the pace in which your team plays. Do you fast break, or use the entire clock to limit the opponent&rsquo;s possessions? Best of all, each coaching option is just that, and option. If you have designs on being the next great college coach, you can implement them all. If you prefer to watch the game unfold, you can implement none. Either way you&rsquo;ll still end up with realistic results!<br/><br/>Take the court today and see if you can guide your favorite team to the ultimate goal of Cuttin&rsquo; Down the Nets!<br/><br/>",

When players land on a space owned by another player they must pay rent. Rent is determined by the location of the property and the number of improvements on the space. Some spaces instruct a player to draw a card which can be beneficial or harmful to the player. Players must avoid going bankrupt to stay in the game.

        "description": "For 1000 years the two rival citadels of the lands were at war with each other. Each citadel was ruled by a mighty master who marched their armies to battle for control over the vast magical pools known as Esper. The Esper imbued their great civilisations with magic, miracles and power. Decade after decade the violence and bloodshed escalated and the increasingly desperate masters performed cursed rituals to gain the advantage. Successive masters and their courts performed dark blood magic and offered tainted Esper to the gods of the cosmos.<br/><br/>Then one night at the sign of the Dread Moon a meteor crashed into the realm and obliterated nearly all life. The Esper turned into fiery Embers which cursed and twisted the lands and its inhabitants beyond imagination. Now nothing remains. Vile Phantoms, deformed creatures and shadows stalk the few remaining survivors.<br/><br/>It has been another 900 years since that fateful impact. The old masters have suddenly been bought back to life having been reanimated by the cursed Embers. They are but mere shadows of their former selves. Their only memory being the wars, anger and hate for each other. Both masters seek to resurrect their long lost champions, drain the lands of its few remaining resources.  Their quest is to rebuild their fallen citadels, summon elemental servants and raise Warbands from the dead. You are the master of the citadel! War will come again.<br/><br/>The goal of Master of the Citadel (MotC) is to create powerful Warbands capable of laying siege to your opponents citadel gates and destroying their city. You begin the game with a champion who you must advance into a powerful character capable of defeating powerful creatures summoned from beyond the spirit realm. Victory in these battles will reward you with the resources you need to scavange legendary weapons and armour, summon elemental servants to do your bidding, develop your citadel and construct deadly warbands.<br/><br/>MotC uses a unique battle system in which your champion summons the spirits of fallen enemies to fight in deadly combat. By performing a cursed ritual you set the difficulty of the encounter and the rewards you get scale accordingly. Victory may yield fate cards that provide hidden bonuses.<br/><br/>Summon elemental servants to boost your champions equipment when needed using MotC&rsquo;s unique flexible battle system.<br/><br/>Build paths, activate mysterious obelisks, explore abandoned keeps and harvest resources such as wood, stone, gold and cursed embers. <br/> Map tiles are colour coordinated and randomised meaning the available resources and strategic locations vary with each game.<br/><br/>Use your citadel board to enchant your champions' equipment. Build warband training grounds, citadel buildings and manage your resource pool.<br/><br/>Accumulate vast resources to build dreaded Warbands of wretched knights, dark mages and undead rangers. Use these warbands to fortify strategic locations, build mines, scout for stat boosting relics.<br/><br/>Then once your powers are at it's peak you are ready to siege and destroy your opponent.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Story<br/><br/>Triple-G is known to many different peoples and creatures by many different names, but most of them know it as the Grey-Green Giant.   It is a very large world located in the Interior of the Expanse, almost directly in the center of Trader's Void.  You would think then that it is a vast hub of activity, given its location, but alas it is not.  You see, for a very very very long time the Gibs and Nowans have slaughtered each other all across the Expanse, and a good-sized majority of that slaughter has happened on Triple-G.  All living things on Triple-G have lived under the constant yoke of their terrible war, until recently... when they vanished!  No one knows why, not that anyone even knows why they were fighting in the first place, but they left Triple-G, and according to rumors, they left the rest of the Expanse as well, and slinked off to their homeworlds to do Void knows what.  And who cares! Because they're gone, it's a miracle, and needless to say, there has been much celebrating.  It is an exciting time to be alive, to be a free person, to be an info collector, to be anyone on Triple-G, but unfortunately we must remember that it is also an ominous time.  Though the Gibs and Nowans have left, they leave behind many vacuums.  Vacuums of space and power that will be quickly filled by the unknown.  Already there are stirrings in the shadows of the townes, and though for the first time in a long long time there are brave travelers heading outside the gates, most never return.  When you consider what you are going to do now, you must exercise extreme caution, and realize the effect your actions will have.  Our eyes need to be wide open, and our minds sharp, both inside the gates, and out.  It is a delicate time in the Expanse, so we must tread delicately.<br/><br/>Kav Moggleberry, Expert Info Collector - Address to new travellers at the first traveller's guild annual raffle and bake sale<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>Tired of the cowards that huddle in fear in the stronghold of Gorth, you gear up and head outside the gates into the unknown landscape.  Explore ruins, find ancient destroyed cities, discover strange abandoned sites, experience new creatures, meet new cultures, but most importantly... find out more about the ominous unknown threat that whispers in the shadows, and threatens all of the free peoples of Triple-G!<br/><br/>Development<br/><br/>Currently playtesting Zone 1: The Green Hills of Gorthicon - Players must clear the Lost Pass before the Ominous Whispers track gets to 6.<br/><br/>",

They eat, they laugh and dance with a lot of action. Of course they make photographs, as everyone wants a picture of him/her with friends to take home. Who gets the most photographs wins. And it works like this: Roll the dice, quickly look for the pictures and grab them fast.<br/><br/>Janosch Bildersuche (with Janosch being an artist and author of childrens books and Bildersuche meaning picture search) consists of 25 cards, each depicting two of Janoschs characters, and 2 6-sided dice that have stickers with these characters on them. All cards are put on the table for everybody to see. The dice are rolled. The first player to find the matching card - depicting the 2 characters that were rolled - touches it with one hand, and if correct gets to keep it. After all picture cards are rolled and found the player with the most cards is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "2-8 player word game that's all about 4-letter words.<br/><br/>Gameplay is simple: write down as many 4-letter words as you can think of within 30 seconds. The words you chose are based on certain criteria established by a roll of the Game Mode die, which includes 6 different game modes: Starts With, Ends With, Dual Rune, Rhymes With, Relation, and Weak Link. The first three modes are letter-based, and decided on the roll of a D20 letter die. The last three modes are word-based, and decided on the flip of a Word Card. Only 4-letter words are allowed (no plurals), and only unique words earn you a point (ie. if another player has the same word as you, neither of you earn a point for that word). First player to 44 points wins.<br/><br/>The game has unique custom packaging, in an engraved wooden box that measures on 3.5&quot; x 5.5&quot; (just a bit bigger than an index card!), and has a wood-and-glass timer, and wooden and bone-colored dice to keep with the old-world runic theme.<br/><br/>",

Each spell card has an immediate effect as well as a lasting Resonance effect. These abilities are used to try and destroy an everlasting onslaught of monsters approaching the castle walls which will move toward the castle each turn as determined by the roll of dice. Defeated monsters are harvested into players' decks by the Soul Crystals they leave behind, to even further boost each player's deck during play.<br/><br/>BattleMage is for 1-4 players (yes, there is a solitaire play variant!) and takes 45-60 minutes to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ringames Words is a fun and innovative game of linguistic competence, where vocabulary and visual dexterity are the protagonists.  Be the fastest to discover the best combination of letters to form the longest word.<br/><br/>The game is played on a board composed of seven concentric circles.  The circles are filled with letters of the alphabet and each letter is on one of two background colours.  The circles can all be rotated to help in forming words.  Each player in turn has ninety seconds (sixty in the advanced game) to form the largest possible word.  Words must be composed of letters with the same background colour that are in a straight line from centre to outside of the board or vice versa, or in the form of a v.  Once used a word cannot be repeated for the rest of the game.  The roll of a dice may require a player to take an &ldquo;informative hexagon&rdquo; with a goal for their turn.  If the goal is met, they will score bonus points, if not, their turn is void.  Scores range from one point for a four letter word to 50 points for an eleven letter word.  The game ends when a player completes their twelfth word.  Most points wins.<br/><br/>A note about playing time: it is highly dependent on the number of players and their experience with the game.  The estimate of 30 minutes is for a two-player game.  With the full complement of eight players, that could rise to 90 minutes.<br/><br/>",

Players take control of a party of characters and fight through the deadly streets of Nevermoor to save the city from certain doom.<br/>The Miniatures<br/><br/>Nevermoor utilizes 40mm pewter cast miniatures to represent the various characters within the game world. Each miniature is created with a mixture of hand sculpting and 3d modeling to create a true to life scale. Each character is designed by Creative Director, David Tepfer in a variety of poses and varying equipment to give each party (no matter the guild) a unique look. Initial designs, artwork, and sculpt pictures can all be found in the &ldquo;Guild Models&rdquo; section of this website.<br/>The Game<br/><br/>Nevermoor is a small scale miniature game. Each party only consists of five models which are divided into one of three party roles:  Leader, Striker, or Tank. The small scale nature of the game allows for truly deep character construction. Each character can purchase upgrades throughout the game, gaining new attacks, skill, and equipment. All of this makes a perfectly paced game whose action slowly increases until it reaches its breaking point in the final few turns!<br/>The World<br/><br/>The King of Nevermoor has gone mad! A mythic plague has taken hold of the city and corrupted the minds and bodies of its citizens. The plague is revered as a gift of the gods by the infected and turned these deformed monsters into &ldquo;holy&rdquo; zealots. In his madness, the King has sealed off the city to cleanse the uninfected. The city&rsquo;s remaining guilds have taken to the streets in attempt to liberate the city but the mass hysteria and rioting has turned the city into a war zone.<br/><br/>The tabletop is packed with buildings, winding streets, and claustrophobic alleys. This unique layout makes playing Nevermoor feel like a massive game of cat and mouse. Hidden traps and ambushes are favored to the open fight in Nevermoor; favoring the clever planner over the brute.<br/><br/>",

Players accomplish this by rolling the die and following the rules based on what is rolled.  The die has three faces that are a simple orange square, one face with a yellow star, one face with the word &quot;right&quot; and one face with the word &quot;left&quot;.<br/>Every third square that is rolled during the game give the roller an opportunity to take a chips from someone.  Every time a star is rolled the player takes a chip from someone.  Rolling right or left changes the direction of play.<br/>If a player loses all three of &quot;their chips&quot; they are out of the game and they must forfeit all of their chips and any others they have won to the player who took their last chip.<br/>The winner is the player who is left with all the chips form all other players.<br/>Setup take 15 seconds.  Games typically last 20 minutes or less.<br/><br/>The game is similar to the 1983 dice game LCR.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "I am Providence<br/><br/>1-4 players <br/>Worker placement<br/>Variable player powers (advanced version)<br/><br/>I am Providence, sets the players in Arkham. Mass and its surrounding areas.<br/><br/>Players will place their workers at different locations to gain types of resources that will help fight the terrors that will visit Arkham.  You'll collect lore, arcana,  and research resources, in addition to gaining the trust of cultists who will help usher in some of the more advanced terrors to Arkham. You must know your enemy and their plans if you wish to defeat them.<br/><br/>The game will have a built in time mechanic that will unleash unspeakable terrors on the town unless the players choose to confront it first.<br/><br/>The eldritch deck will contain 3 levels of terror which will visit the town.  Each time the game is played the deck will vary, as a certain number of cards is added to each of the three levels, changing with the number of players. <br/>Example. There are 18 level 1 terrors, in a typical game there will be only 6 in the level 1 deck. When setting up the game players will randomly choose 6 terrors and shuffle them.  Ensuring that you'll always have a fresh, exciting game as you never know what horrors may come to town.<br/><br/>Battling an ancient evil one won't always be easy, but will undoubtably increase in difficulty as the game progresses.<br/><br/>When battle commences, a player will flip the top of the eldritch deck and have to have the corresponding resources to defeat the terror. <br/>Defeating the terrors that confront Arkham will earn you valuable Elder signs (victory points) as well as possibly gaining additional resources.  Encountering these ancient terrible entities won't be easy on your psyche though, defeating or even just encountering these awful creatures can affect your sanity.<br/><br/>Collect too many insanity cubes and one of your workers will be eliminated from the game and have to check in to Arkham Asylum.<br/><br/>The game progresses through all three levels of the Eldritch deck, culminating with a final battle with an Elder god.<br/><br/>When a player defeats the final Elder God in the deck the game ends and Arkham is temporarily safe.  The player who has gained the most Elder Signs will claim victory.<br/><br/>In the advanced game, players will become famous personalities from the Lovecraft Mythos, gaining benefits and even possibly penalties based on the chosen characters.<br/><br/>I am Providence will be deeply rooted in the Lovecraft Mythos, never straying from the original source material. Many authors have continued the work of HP Lovecraft, expanding his Mythos and building a world of terror. We will focus solely on his writing and works for the base game.  (Though who knows of we'll see a return to Arkham in expansions).<br/><br/>Artistically, I am Providence will capture the theme and essence of the late 60's and early 70's American International Pictures movie one sheets.  The goal is to present I am Providence as a lost movie title in their series of films that were based on the works of Poe, though their films &quot;The Dunwhich  Horror', 'The Haunted Palace'  and 'Die, Monster, Die' borrowed heavy from Lovecraft.<br/><br/>",

Players start in the dark forest and walk through the circles of hell in order to reach Purgatory. To pass from one circle to the next, players must collect a &quot;coin of clemency&quot; in every circle. To gain these coins, they answer questions and solve tasks. Questions are about the daily life in Dante's Florence, the Middle Ages, and the creatures and sinners that players encounter during their journey. All questions are multiple choice and require no previous knowledge of the Divine Comedy; they can be answered using deduction and working with the other players.<br/><br/>Tasks often require cooperation, e.g., a player has to select a prominent sinner from real life and send him to an appropriate circle while the other players have to guess the circle. Players interact a lot during play, both helping and misleading one another, stealing and donating coins. Players can also use &quot;coins of indulgence&quot; to get favors from other players or &quot;coins of clemency&quot;.<br/><br/>The player who collects all &quot;coins of clemency&quot; and passes Lucifer in the last circle wins.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>Dantes Reise durch die H&ouml;lle basiert auf dem ersten Teil der G&ouml;ttlichen Kom&ouml;die von Dante Alighieri, dem Inferno.

Sie beantworten Fragen und l&ouml;sen Aufgaben, um diese M&uuml;nzen zu erhalten.

Five powers struggle for dominance through military power, cultural and scientific prestige, far distant explorations and diplomatic back-stabbing. England, France, Germania, Spain and the Ottoman empire are all equally strong and for the moment they maintain a power balance. However, anything may disrupt this delicate state.<br/><br/>As a player you take the seat as chief advisor to the ruler of one of the five powers. You are the true power behind the throne. Use resources to grow the empire and make cultural progress. Send trusted emissaries and generals to other nations in order to gain influence via diplomatic trickery or military skills. Gather the best captains to explore the New world or the far east. Ally with the minor powers of Europe in order to influence them into aiding you against your enemies. Use the ruler as long as it fits your plans and find a new when they don't. Your next move will change the power balance in Europe. Make your move, but choose your actions carefully.<br/><br/>In brief, the game is played on a large map of Europe. Players take turns using cards for their effect or for action points (AP). With APs they may perform different actions engaging leaders of their power. Each power have a certain number of leaders with different strengths available for use. These leaders may be used as ambassadors acting on your behalf in the courts of Europe, as explorers or colonizers bringing back knowledge and treasures from distant countries, as patrons of the arts or the scientists or as military generals conquering the lands of your enemies. The power who first conquer a defined amount of key spaces in Europe or collects most victory points (VP) after a number of turns wins the game.<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>     1 Game board<br/>     108 Strategy cards <br/>     36 Conflict cards<br/>     50 Character tokens <br/>     110 Influence discs <br/>     100 Victory point tokens<br/>     5 Players screens<br/><br/><br/>",

If no one matches the active player, no one scores points; if everyone matches, then everyone but the active player scores 2 points; if some number in between match, the correct guessers score 2 points while the active player scores 1 point for each correct guess.<br/><br/>Players use their 20-sided die to track their score, and the first player to reach 20 points wins!<br/><br/>",

As you progress through the game, your fate will be determined by your strategy and dice rolls; this combined with a random map creation element guarantees that no two playthroughs will ever be the same.<br/><br/>Players will choose one of six pre-made characters, all of which come equipped with innate abilities that will aid them on their journey. Characters are represented by their respective token on the board, and their Character Card, which will track their points, items and power-ups.<br/><br/>Having chosen their characters, players set off in exploration of the island to discover its hidden secrets by creating and exploring the map as the turns progress. The starting map tile is placed first with each character token on the tile. At the beginning of each player&rsquo;s turns, he/she picks up and places a map tile into play, and places a special markers called an Event or Loot Tokens if the tile requests.<br/><br/>Events are then triggered when a player moves onto a space with an event token by drawing the appropriate number of cards from the corresponding deck, and then continues their turn as normal.<br/><br/>Antillia&rsquo;s Event and Loot card decks will be comprised of over 170 beautifully illustrated cards.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players will accumulate gold and items for defeating the many monsters and challenges on the island. Items retained in the players&rsquo; inventory spaces will each have an intrinsic gold value of bullion coin that adds to your final score. Keep in mind, other players may try to obtain your gold or loot by any means possible. Keep a sharp eye out for thieves and backstabbers.<br/><br/>Combat is turn based and the attack order is decided by the highest AP score when an attack is declared; attack power is determined by dice roll damage indicated by the player&rsquo;s equipped weapon.<br/><br/>Upon vanquishing the game&rsquo;s boss, a portal opens allowing all players the chance to escape the island. Those who manage to escape Antillia add up their total gold and item value by counting all gold coins earned and item value in their extended inventory. The player at the end of the game able to escape the island with the most gold value wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "C'est la Guerre is an adaptation of the popular De Bellis Antiquitatis (DBA) rules to the &quot;horse and musket&quot; era (i.e., early 18th century through the Napoleonic era).<br/><br/>There are several adaptations of DBA which have been made for the horse and musket period.  Unlike DBA, armies are not limited to a fixed number of units (e.g., 12), instead using point values to construct approximately balanced forces of varying size.  Generals and sub-generals are rated on their ability, resulting in larger command radii for more capable generals.  For a single command &quot;pip&quot;, a general is able to order all units, lines and columns within his command radius.  Combat is different than DBA in that units may be disordered and take casualties resulting in degraded performance until they can rally or reform.<br/><br/>",

That is of course, if there is a victor at all. Known only to the King and his closest<br/>trustees, the Challenge is actually a real threat against the kingdom. Thus meaning it will place the<br/>Champions in real danger. They must face deadly monsters, tricky traps, and even the threat of<br/>each other. However, they may be forced to work together if they wish to survive.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>The game starts by choosing the Challenge. Each challenge is played on a different Location tile<br/>and a deck of cards with unique monsters, traps, events, and Boss Monster. Next the players choose<br/>their Champions. There are four clans to choose from with a male and female version of each.<br/>The Champions have unique attributes which make playing each one a bit different. On a turn,<br/>each player has 3 Action points to spend. Actions include recovering, exploring, attacking,<br/>making skill checks, and commanding a pet! While exploring, they will earn Challenge points for<br/>defeating monsters and escaping traps. Each Challenge has a few events that must occur before the<br/>Boss shows up. This can happen at anytime during the game and players might not always be ready!<br/>Players will find powerful treasures like weapons, shields, and talismans that will make them more<br/>powerful. Collecting as many challenge points as possible before the Challenge is completed is the<br/>primary goal, next to surviving of course!<br/><br/>Clans of Rivaland:<br/><br/>Slayers<br/>Shaman<br/>Marksman<br/>Machinist<br/><br/>",

Draw a card from the deck, then play a card.<br/><br/>You can add a body part to your alien - you need to collect a body, a head, two antenna, two arms, two wings, two legs and a tail - or you can play a card that affects an opponent by stealing one of their body parts or one of their cards.<br/><br/>Watch out for the red cards - these must be played immediately and could wipe out your hand.  And there's one card in the deck that destroys your entire alien!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;The year is 2027 and the federal government of the United States, hobbled by the second great depression, is on the edge of collapse. A number of Insurgent factions have sprung up hoping to undermine the government and send the country into a state of anarchy, in the belief they stand to gain power or wealth in the coming lawlessness.<br/><br/>Choose your side: Become one of three insurgent factions bent on sowing chaos by launching ever greater terror events, or make one last stand on behalf of the United States. If you can stand firm and keep this country from descending into anarchy you will restore the people's faith in its government and keep the American dream alive.&quot;<br/><br/>Threat Level Red is a game for 4 players where three players play the role of insurgent factions attacking from within the united states, and one player takes on the role of the hobbled, fading federal government.<br/><br/>As an insurgent faction your goal is to increase the anarchy level in the US to 20 by launching insurgent events. Each turn begins with a hidden token deployment phase where you must secretly plant sleeper cell and insurgent event tokens in major cities across the country. Once all the insurgent player's plans are set players then take turns revealing one secret token at time. Each sleeper cell token you activate increases the action points available to you to play your event cards, but also gives the US player more information about where you are planning your next event. Do you carry out small safer operations to draw additional event cards, cell tokens, and earn resources, or do you try to go all out and launch a major, but risky offensive by playing one of your major event cards? Once your organization has grown strong enough anything is possible- from a simple bomb threat, to hacking the nation's closed circuit TV network, or for the most powerful and violent factions building the dreaded suitcase nuke, but if the american player can deduce where your next event is taking place you stand to lose everything.<br/><br/>As the government player you seek to foil as many insurgent events as possible. If you can foil 12 insurgent events, or survive 5 game turns without the anarchy level rising to 20 points you are victorious. Unfortunately you are understaffed and nearly out of resources to face the burgeoning threats facing the nation. You begin the game with a small number of agent units that you must allocate between the major geographic &quot;zones&quot; of the united states. At the start of each turn you gain a small number of reinforcements: additional agent units and counterplot cards. Your counterplot cards will let you set up wiretaps, border patrols, undercover agents. Each time it is your turn you may send up to one agent token per &quot;zone&quot; to investigate a face down enemy token. If you correctly select a location of an insurgent event that event is discarded and you gain 1 stability point, but if the hidden token you reveal turns out to be an enemy sleeper cell the agent will most likely be lost in the ensuing gunfight. Since you have far fewer agents then your enemies have sleeper cells if you were to send your agents in to investigate every hint of insurgent activity you would soon be out of agents and quickly overrun. So instead, watch closely, let the insurgents overextend, give them enough rope to hang themselves before making your move. If you wait too long you risk letting another terror attack slip through your fingers, but if you strike at the right time even a small handful of well-trained agents can topple these immense terror networks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Botchee Deluxe is a dice game where players will be attempting to create specific number patterns using one of six different modes of game play. The dice are sometimes rolled and sometimes simply used to represent a player's number. The game comes with two different plastic grids that the dice site in, allowing for customizable play and shifting of game difficulty. Most of the games play much like Suduko, with number patterns being required across rows and columns. But some of the games also allow for speed play and solo play. The entire game fits in a small plastic case, making it an easy travel game.<br/><br/>A few examples of the game modes of play include:<br/><br/>o Region: This game mode uses columns and rows in the game frame. A row and a column region extends from one side of the game frame to the other. A box  region can only be located in one of the game frame corners. Players take turns selecting one of the dice and placing it in the game frame. The goal is to be the first player to complete a number sequence using one of the 3 regions.<br/><br/>o Speed: This game mode is all about solving the same Sudoku like puzzle using the Region play mode as quickly as possible. A stopwatch or other timekeeping device is necessary to play this game mode. The winner is the player with the best time.<br/><br/>",

The winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/>Hooey<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ve got to be sharp. You&rsquo;ve got to be shifty. Announce which cards you&rsquo;re laying face down. Whether you tell the truth is up to you. Any player can then question your honesty. If they&rsquo;re right - you get the pile, if they&rsquo;re wrong - they do! First player to get rid of all their cards wins.<br/><br/>Rats!<br/><br/>Kid's game of pure luck. Cards are dealt face down to all players. Turn up cards in rotation and put them in the center; if you turn up a Big Fat Rat (rather than a Random Rat), you get all the cards in the center, unless the next player can also turn up a BFR. Object is to collect all the cards.<br/><br/>Royal Fluster<br/><br/>Players are dealt five cards from a modified standard deck and attempt to put together a Royal Flush by drawing and discarding cards. If you discard an Ace, you must draw a Fluster card and follow the instructions, hoping not to be harmed. The first player to make a royal flush wins the game.<br/><br/>Spit!<br/><br/>Each player deals 4 stacks with 7 down and the 8th card up. Play with only one hand (right, unless left-handed).

Keep playing until ALL have used all their card piles.<br/><br/>Three Throws<br/><br/>This game has a theme of rock-scissors-paper. It is played in two different rounds. In the first round, players take turns turning up cards on a face-down tableau. If they turn up a set of winners, these cards are taken into hand. When all of the card possible are taken, the second round begins, which is essentially a game of war between players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "'Thick as Thieves' is a cooperative board game  based on the idea that all players are working together to steal an item from a well guarded museum.  You&rsquo;ll have to work together to infiltrate the system, sneak past guards, and get past the alarms and locked doors.  Be careful though, there isn't always honor amongst thieves.  At any time, if the opportunity presents itself, a player may choose to betray everyone and steal a secondary item they've been eye-balling since before the heist even started!<br/><br/>Each player is a thief with different abilities moving silently (hopefully) around the museum at night dodging roaming guards and security cameras.  When they reach a designated location, they attempt a challenge based on an attribute that each character has a varying amount of (Brawn, Brains, Sneak, Charm).<br/><br/>Once they succeed in their challenge, players get to choose a card that allows them to trigger a change in the board's circumstances.  They can turn off security cameras, move guards, turn off the lights, unlock doors or turn off alarms. If everything goes smoothly, your team will work like clockwork to steal the one item you're all here for.  If all goes smoothly.<br/><br/>Not only do the players have to work precisely, but they have to work quickly before the next guard shift comes in.  As the game progresses, a deck of cards is pulled changing the position of the guards and moving the clock ever so dangerously close to the end of the game.  Get your item out of the museum before the deck runs out!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "St. George and the Dragon is played on a round board shaped like a wheel with 14 spokes, with a pattern of points on those lines starting from its center and radiating out to the edge of the board. Longitudinal lines are also drawn connecting the points. The central circle is green and is called the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair.  At four equidistant locations on the outer circle, an additional three points (connected by lines to each other and to three points on the board&rsquo;s outer edge) form Knight&rsquo;s Castles, one each named for St. George, St. Patrick, St. Andrew, and St. David. The Dragon&rsquo;s lone piece begins the game on the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair; the Knights&rsquo; three pieces each begin on the points of the Knight&rsquo;s Castle.<br/><br/>Beginning with the Knights and ending with the Dragon, players take turns rolling a die and moving according to the results. The player will move any one of their pieces the exact number of points rolled on the die, in any combination of directions, so long as the lines between points are followed and points are not crossed or landed on a second time.  Pieces cannot move to or jump over occupied points, except when the Dragon captures a Knight. Dragons move in the same fashion as Knights, but when their move ends on an occupied point, that Knight is removed from play. The Dragon may win the game by taking two of each Knight&rsquo;s pieces. Knights may not capture or slay the Dragon, but may win by reaching the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair central point with two of their pieces. The first Knight to do so wins the game.  A Knight may not pass over the Dragon&rsquo;s Lair as part of a move; they must land there only on the end of their move. Having landed on the board&rsquo;s central point, the Knight is then removed from play and set behind his Castle to keep score.<br/><br/>The game can be played by two, three, four, or five players.  For five players, one each plays a Knight and one the Dragon. For four players the game is the same but St. Patrick&rsquo;s Knights are not used.  For three players, one player takes the Knights of St. Andrew and St. George, one player takes St. David and St. Patrick, and one the Dragon. For two players, one will play all four Knights and the other the Dragon.<br/><br/>St. George and the Dragon takes its inspiration from the old tale of the same name.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Red Queen is a card game pitting a team of 2 to 5 players against the infamous Queen of Hearts, a character as unpredictable as Lewis Caroll described in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland. Using deduction to work out how best to advance their plans, the team must assemble an army of soldiers to challenge the Red Queen.<br/><br/>In The Red Queen, the player cards are facing outwards in such a manner that all players except the one holding them will know what they are. Each round players will be able to give clues to one another to lift part of the mystery surrounding the pool of cards they collectively possess, build their army, or use special roles actions to help them in this endeavour.<br/><br/>... meanwhile the evil Red Queen will continually interfere with the team using a set of treacherous actions in the hope to make them lose 'heart', literraly, the currency representing the team's morale in the game. Her own army will also grow throughout the game, putting the team under pressure to raise their own as efficiently as possible.<br/><br/>The game features a strong thematic element and role cards based on characters directly inspired by Lewis Caroll's work. Alice herself takes on a key role too, unsurprisingly, but as an outsider will be of equal support to both sides and it is up to the players to make the most of her abilities.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the year 2025 and the entire world has fallen under the reign of a group of super villains known only as &quot;The Collective&quot;. People are oppressed and the world has fallen deep into darkness with little hope of even a glimpse of light. In this dark world, a group of superheroes has risen to combat the villains and retake the world from their grasp.<br/><br/>Each mission is deadly, as both villains and superheroes must enter combat, defend themselves, and collect the previous element &quot;levinium&quot; or face destruction. Levinium is the heroes's hope of taking down the villains.<br/><br/>Reign of Evil is a print-and-play game in the genre of superheroes and supervillians. The game uses a card mechanic, and no dice, in order to perform combat. It plays quickly with minimal down time for players. Players move figures around the board to collect levinium until all wound markers are exhausted, until the deck runs out, or all levinium pieces are gone. Alternatively, players can play timed games. On their turns, players draw a hand of cards that contain a mix of Move and Action cards. Using these cards, players move around the board and take various actions, such as combat or collecting levinium.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Be the first to get released from the Infamous Dartmoor Prison. Shrouded in mist and mystery! A game of twists and barbed wire turns.<br/><br/>THE GUV'NOR! You play rival prison gangs; the Landing Mob, the Kitchen Gang, the Gym Boyz, the Garden Crew, the Laundry Syndicate and the Library Club<br/><br/>Win the game by earning 20 parole points and be the first to get released!!<br/><br/>The game is designed by people who know what it's like, so the game has an authenticity beyond the traditional escape scenario!. In this game it's a bad move when a gang member escapes, because it weakens the gang left inside!<br/><br/>Players compete to gain territory across the prison map.  Winners place their cards in one of the vacant cells in the block.  The block makes a decision by a majority vote about who is to be The GUV&quot;NOR.  Unless one player has more than half the cells deals need to be done between players. Players then move along the track (called the perimeter wall) and where they land decides what actions take place.  Actions can change the number of cards in the block, place or remove trouble cards on the prison map, or require the block to make decisions.  Decisions will be determined by both the cards in the block at the time and the relationship  between the players.<br/><br/>This game enables all members of the family to play as it provides lots of times when &quot;I win you lose&quot; scenarios to arise.<br/><br/>Simple rules means they are easily mastered and that enables more sophisticated game play as players try to use the rules to get ahead.<br/><br/>Further rules including challenging the leadership of the GUV'NOR - making  regular decisions about who to back and what parole points to deal with  and lockdown - which gives the current GUV'NOR power to make the decisions the block did, including being ale to win a leadership challenge whatever the number of cards in the block raise tension as players try to find away to either stay in control or wrestle it away from others without the wrong rivals taking control.<br/><br/>If no one player dominates the Block then deals have to be done between players to form packs. But trust no one. Each turn players roll a dice and move around the board along the perimiter wall as they serve their sentence and have to make decisions about who they support. Decisions are determined by the number of gang member cards they have in The Block. Each turn can change the number of cards a player has and so alter their influence. Players have to manoeuvre themselves through their sentence until one player has gained 20 parole points. Points are lost or gained by getting caught by the staff, taking control of the Block, time served and from doing deals with other players to get their support.<br/><br/>This leads to a fast paced game, players are constantly changing sides, working out who best to support, and not getting caught by the staff. Watch as the  staff increase security, send you to solitary and threatens lockdown!   It is an exhausting game of wit, strategy, coercion and survival that brings out the best and the worst in participants! In the end you don't just win you probably get rehabilitated!<br/><br/>The rules are designed to be interdependent, hence the block makes decisions that effect the level of security.  At both extremes, ie too high or too low the scale has a trouble space.  If the scale is on trouble and all of the trouble cards are placed on the map then trouble starts.  this is a spontaneous battle for territory that lasts 4 turns and enables a potentially dramatic change in who runs the block.  This rule, like many others provides an exciting tension where players can predict what could happen next (within the dice roll) to change who is winning or what opportunities were lost to defeat who is currently in charge.<br/><br/>The game is very visual, so it matters where the players pieces are along the perimeter wall, how many cards are held in the block, what bonus cards are in solitary, whether the prison is in lockdown or not, and how many trouble cards there are on the map.<br/><br/>",

Play the leader of your own faction - THE ARMY, NAVY, AIRFORCE, BIG BUSINESS, THE PARTY AND THE FAMILY. Win by getting BRINKMANSHIP points, which reflect how good you are at manipulating your opponents and surviving as you raise the levels of international tension to nuclear levels. Win by getting to 20 points without blowing up the World<br/><br/>The Armed Forces, Big Business, The Party and the Family compete to fill the Central Committee with their supporters. The player who runs the Central Committee is The Leader!  There can only ever be one Leader, so it is importnat to understand the rules of the game and use them to your advantage! If no one player dominates the Committee then deals have to be done. Each turn players move around the board along the demilitarised zone which runs along the perimeter of the board and have to make decisions. Decisions are determined by the number of cards they have in The Central Committee. Each turn can change the number of cards a player has and so alter their influence. Players have to manoeuvre themselves through the politics until one player has gained 20 brinkmanship points. Points are gained by taking control of the Committee, time as Leader and from doing deals with other players to get their support.<br/><br/>At the same time the committee decides the level of international tension.  As public parades whip up popular fervour and brinkmanship is taken to a nuclear level so the opportunities for players to decide how to run the World's most secret State determine who ends up winning the game and who gets manipulated.<br/><br/>This leads to a fast paced game, players are constantly changing sides, working out who best to support, and not getting caught out in political exile. It is an exhausting game of wit, strategy, coercion and survival that brings out the best and the worst in participants! In the end you don't just win you have an great evening's entertainment!<br/><br/>Each space on the demilitarised zone offers the opportunity for the composition of central committee to change as players are beset with show trials, parades, rocket launches, 6 party peace talks and nuclear tests!<br/><br/>Past deals, double deals, double cross and you see where the strategy starts. Each player's strategy will be determined by their own strength of character, belief in their own destiny, how well they can manipulate others to support them and how they make best use of the opportunities as they arise.<br/><br/>As the game evolves so moments of growing tension occur as the population get ever more excited with increasing parades across the the Country, international tension nears extreme levels, infighting means there are no clear alliances and the date of the next central committee election approaches, only to be disrupted by a spontaneous war game! and rocket launch. Leadership crisis and mayhem. But then players only have themselves to blame as what happens is a result of the choices players make in the central committee. Ultimately players have the choice to create a peace agreement where the right strategies are promoted rather than a dash to the winning line! It is interesting to see how as a player nears the winning line that choice becomes more challenging!<br/><br/>As they say - Your best strategy is paranoia, take brinkmanship to a nuclear level and tale control of the Worlds most secret State!<br/><br/>",

First person to score two Imperial Goals cards is the Emperor. Just be wary of those pesky Rebels that show up to ruin your plans anytime you roll a 12.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Life's tough for goblins.  As if the klastra birds and grignak spiders weren't enough, there's also the constant possibility of having your house blown up by your neighbors (not always on purpose, it's just that most goblins are too curious for their own good).  Mix that with a goblin's natural packrat tendency and what do you get?  A lot of junk left behind in storage (a booming industry for the last 79 years), usually without an owner.<br/><br/>In Goblin Garage Sale, players are goblin entrepreneurs hoping to get lucky.  Gobo Storing Places Inc. is having a large blind auction of many of its storage garages.  However, players are allowed to see only part of the items in the garage. Using their specific knowledge, players bid their hard-earned monies against the others for the contents.  To the winner: the garage!  Hopefully, it will be filled with glorious junk that the player can add to his personal hoard (for the goblin with the greatest hoard has the greatest bragging rights). If you're lucky, you may even find more monies for future bids!  Just hope that the unfortunate former owner didn't hoard useless things, like soap, and pray that when you open your garage it isn't full of horrors, like kittens (how embarrassing) or even a grignak spider (run!).<br/><br/>Goblin Garage Sale is a game of bluffing and luck.<br/><br/>",

Some spaces give you points automatically, some tell you to draw a card, some do nothing, and some will tell you to go to other spaces on the board (generally further back) - however you win by getting the most points, NOT by finishing first, so this isn't necessarily bad.<br/><br/>At the end of your trek around the board, you come to the 'Self Reliance' square where you 'wish' on a star (choose one of 3) and then attempt to roll one of the two numbers on it (they have 1-6, 2-5 and 3-4 on them) If you roll correctly you collect the points and you are done. Otherwise you draw a card.<br/><br/>After 2 players have landed on their wished star, the game ends. The player obtaining the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>The game consists of:<br/><br/>     A Game Board<br/>     64 cards<br/>     5 marbles (pawns)<br/>     1 Die (D6)<br/>     Instructions<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Turn based tactics meets collectible card gaming in a Japanese RPG-style online game by the creators of Star Ocean &amp; Valkyrie Profile<br/><br/>Take a collectible card game, add turn-based strategy, and bring it to life with stunning Japanese artwork and story-driven role-playing. This is Alteil: Horizons, the all new sequel to one of Japan&rsquo;s most popular online card games, soon to be ready for fantasy, tactical combat, card game, and anime enthusiasts worldwide.<br/><br/>Four Gods Sleep Under Lavato&hellip;<br/><br/>Harness Their Power!<br/><br/>You are an Iczer, a summoner and master strategist tasked with protecting the world of Lavato from the forces of Batora, the embodiment of evil accross all dimensions. An ancient struggle between Batora and the four Old Gods of Lavato drained the Gods of power, sinking them into a sleep that has lasted thousands of years. But the Gods still influence Lavato from the depths of slumber&hellip;<br/><br/>One night, a new Prince is born, and the sun suddenly rises. Night becomes day, and a miracle is proclaimed. The Church of the True God takes advantage of the miracle to orchestrate the installation of the Solar Prince to the throne - and the ensuing power struggle plunges Lavato into war.<br/><br/>With the violence, tragedy, and death of the war, Batora&rsquo;s hunger for evil and chaos is stoked - and he&rsquo;s set his sights on Lavato again! But with the Old Gods deep in slumber, who will protect Lavato from Batora&rsquo;s endless rage?<br/><br/>Now is the time of the Iczers. They&rsquo;ve studied the legends of Lavato&rsquo;s Old Gods. They&rsquo;ve learned to command the Gods&rsquo; powerful Four Spheres of Influence. They&rsquo;ve mastered the art of using these Spheres to summon heroes, monsters, and dragons to battle the forces of chaos and evil. Will you be the brave Iczer who saves Lavato from destruction?<br/><br/>As in any collectible card game, a game of Alteil: Horizons begins with carefully crafting a deck. There&rsquo;s a universe of over 1,000 cards to choose from, each representing the factions, heroes, villains, monsters and magic of Lavato&rsquo;s past and present. Your collection begins with any of four free 30-card starter decks, themed around the four Spheres.<br/><br/>Once you&rsquo;ve challenged another Iczer to a duel, use your resources wisely to play your cards. Spell cards represent your command of the Spheres; unit cards represent your ability to summon heroes and monsters. Each unit is a fully fleshed-out combatant, complete with hit points, attack and defense power, agility, and range. Combat takes place on a battle grid - maneuver your units so that their unique abilities fit your winning strategy. And their abilities really are unique! A fighter with two swords might be able to hit two enemies at once; a mage can tap into your resources to play spells that wreak havoc on the entire battlefield! You have complete control of each unit&rsquo;s abilities during combat.<br/><br/>A number of features set Alteil apart from the other online card games out there. For example...<br/><br/>Range based grid: position archers behind your front-line fighters to launch a ranged attack. Position your mages in the rear to protect them as they cast powerful defensive and offensive spells.<br/><br/>Resource recycling: when a card dies, you get back the resources you spent on it. Two small soldiers die? Use the Spell Points they originally cost to bring out something big and scary.<br/><br/>Revival system: if a unit dies you can spend a copy of it from your deck to revive it on the battlefield. Keep your best soldiers alive to execute killer multi-unit combos!<br/><br/>Soul Cards: influence the pace of the game by choosing your starting Life Points and Soul Skills. Give yourself stronger Soul Skills and less Life for a more offense-based approach, or give yourself more Life Points to buy time for a crafty strategy.<br/><br/>Day/Night cycle: as duels rage on, the sun rises and sets. Units like the Undead and Werewolves are stronger at night - while a holy warrior gets bonuses under the first rays of morning - so summon them when they&rsquo;ll be most effective!<br/><br/>Alteil has over two thousand individual pieces of art completed already. It&rsquo;s got the visual style and story of a Japanese RPG. It&rsquo;s got unique game mechanics. We hope you&rsquo;ll become a huge fan. We already are. This is Alteil: Horizons.<br/><br/>",

This has been done before by professional and amateur outfits, but for the first time, modern Conflict Simulation Techniques have been employed to provide more &quot;realism&quot;.<br/><br/>The game is designed for two players, but if desired can be played by up to four. Various techniques are included for shortening or lengthening the game.<br/><br/>Each turn , the various players will attempt to determine the location of their opponents ships, and to direct fire into those hexes in an attempt to sink enemy ships. The player in each game who has the last vessel afloat will be declared the winner. It is possible that in a particular game the players may be unable to damage each other further. This can only happen when one  has a submarine with no torpedoes left, and the other has a ship with no ASW capability. In this case, the game is a tie.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "To Market The New Tractor Game is typical roll and move board game about farming and agriculture made at Harborne, England by Chad Valley Games in approximately 1950s. The game involves various farming related obstacles and successes, mainly based around farming machinery. So for example successes include &quot;You now have your new tractor - succeed as usual&quot;, &quot;A post hole digger to re-fence your field - go forward&quot;, &quot;Ploughing demonstration - go forward&quot;, &quot;Good hammer milled feed keeps up milk yield - transport box moves churns easily - go forward&quot;. Obstacles include &quot;Tractor oil should have been changed - go back&quot;, &quot;Your field is flooded - go back&quot;, &quot;Tractor neglected - go back&quot; etc. <br/>The first player to finish exactly on 200 has arrived at the market and is the winner.<br/><br/>The graphics on game board are lovely. The course goes through typical English landscape starting at an old farm house, and then through country lanes, ploughed fields, past the &bdquo;Ferguson School of Farm Mechanisation&ldquo; (Massey Ferguson farm machinery), past streams, bridges, churches, farmyards, hay bales, and various farm vehicles to a market in a little town at the end. The board provides an image of a lost, bygone England.<br/><br/>",

As the title suggests &ndash; it has a mountaineering theme, which is highlighted by the image on the box lid.<br/><br/>It is a simple race game, played with dice and counters. But what makes it more attractive is that the board &ndash; which is stored folded in the box needs to be stood up inside the box base to form a mountain. You start at the bottom of one side and the first person to reach 100 is the winner. You go up one side and then down the other. Instead of &lsquo;squares&rsquo; on a regular board this one has numbered holes. The reason for this is that the counters slot into those holes. There are four 1&frac12;&rdquo; high metal climbers. They actually look as if they are Boy Scouts. The figures are identical except that their shorts are different colours. They are red, yellow, green and blue.<br/><br/>",

Battle your way to the top by attacking other chef's reputations, enlisting the services of food minions, making magic in the kitchen, and getting your hands dirty by taking the plate to speed up your burger-making skills.<br/><br/>Burger Blitz's main mechanic is press-your-luck dice rolling. What you roll determines 6 different bonuses you can earn that round - Reputation, Burger Ingredients, Pepper, Mayo, Attack, and Tips.<br/><br/>In addition to dice, there are 24 minion cards which players can purchase. These minions give players permanent bonuses they can use every turn.<br/><br/>Finally there are magic cards. Magic cards are earned every time a player completes a full burger. These cards are powerful but can only be used once. Play a mayo token with a magic card to boost the effects even more.<br/><br/>Burger Blitz is easy enough for young children to learn but has enough depth and strategy to entertain seasoned gamers. Included in the rulebook are several variants recommended for more casual or more cutthroat games.<br/><br/>",

This game  is in memory of all the people died during the March 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami.<br/>Each player represent a Japanese Rescue Team and will try to solve the problems ariring in the Japaed on the map.<br/><br/>The objective of the players is to reach the level 8 of the Level of Saved Lifes Track (LSL) depicted on the map, which means having saved most of the affected population and thus avoiding to reach the level -7, which would mean the loss of too many lives.<br/>Each player chooses its set of Japanese Rescue Teams (JRT) and deploy the Team 1 in a city on the map. All the Problem Tiles are put in a cup and shuffled together.<br/>The Sequence of play is like the following:<br/>The playing player rolls the d12 die: if the result is 1-6 a new Problem arises (go to c); if the result is 7-12, no new Problems! (go to e.)<br/>c. Roll the d12 die to see in which city the Problem occur (each city has a name and a reference number)<br/>d. Take one Problem Tile form the cup, see which kind of problem is shown and put it near the city rolled during c.<br/>e. Every Player can move his/her JRT in any city shown in the map, normally where there is a Problem or Ruins; there he/she tries to solve a Problem, starting from the playing Player.<br/>A JRT can try to solve one Problem per turn, so if there is more than one Problem Tile in a city, the playing Player must choose which one will be tried by his/her JRT.<br/>If the JRT manages to resolve the Problem, raise by 1 level the LSL Track, turn the Problem tile on the Ruins side.<br/>If the JRT does not manage to solve the Problem, the Problem remains and at the start of the next turn, will decrease the LSL:<br/>The players have to clear Ruins in order to avoid negative DRM in solving the Problems.<br/><br/>A nice small cooperative game!<br/><br/>",

Players will attack nicely illustrated battleship profiles by tossing and  dropping  darts along with rolling balls.  While tradition pointed darts can be used,   the more graphic play uses dart(s) or ball(s)  dipped in washable collorinfg for graphic splatters that mimic highly visual and realistic explosions.  The game can be very simple dart toss game or be more complex by using the written game guide rules.   Game play utilizes an eraser head dart but players can choose their own metal/plastic point type darts.   The duration of play is between 20 minutes to more than an 60 minutes, depending if you play one, two, or all three parts.  You can play the game in teams, family play or solo.

        "description": "Based on the song by Jonathan Coulton, Re: Your Brains pits 2-5 players against each other and the zombie horde.  Players play food and office supply cards face up in front of them to give them bonuses, play weapon cards to destroy zombies, and play any card face down in front of their opponents to create more zombies that want to eat their brains.<br/><br/>Each player starts out as a heroic human and can win if they are the sole survivor, OR they can become overrun by zombies and become a zombie master.  Each zombie master has a different victory condition.<br/><br/>This game should not be confused with the other card game of the same name.  Same inspiration; different implementation.<br/><br/>",

Someone shuffles the deck, then each player receives ten cards face down, which they place in a row in front of them. Playing simultaneously and as quickly as possible, players reveal these cards (without rearranging them), then start taking cards one at a time from those scattered in the center of the table and placing them on one of the ten cards in front of them, thereby creating stacks of cards as the game progresses. If a player draws a thunderstorm card, she can place it on any stack.<br/><br/>As soon as a player has ten number cards in ascending order from left to right, she yells &quot;Stop!&quot; and ends the round. If she's correct, she scores 10 points, plus 2 points for ending the round. Each other player scores points for the number of cards in order starting from their left stack. In addition, each card with a lightning bolt (whether in order or not) is worth 1 point, while each thunderstorm card is worth -1 point. Players then shuffle the cards and start another round. Whoever reaches 50 or more points first wins!<br/><br/>",

The ships are represented by pieces of wood with holes drilled to hold small flags; the position of the flag in a ship represents its speed. The color of a flag represents how many operational guns the ship has.<br/><br/>Movement is performed by spending one knot (movement point) for each intersection moved and/or each 60 degrees turned. Ships may not sail directly into the wind, which may shift at the start of each round (based on a die roll).<br/><br/>When a ship fires at a target it declares whether it is aiming at the decks or the rigging and rolls on the appropriate table. The die roll needed to hit further depends on the number of guns the attacker has, the class of the target (1st, 2nd, or 3rd rate), the range, and whether the target is beam on or end on to the attacker.<br/><br/>There are a few additional rules for heaving to and boarding.<br/><br/>The rules were published in Games &amp; Puzzles #1 (May 1972).<br/><br/>",

There are other spaces where Golf Pro cards are drawn, which can be used for benefits on later strokes. Golf Pro cards are also awarded for under-par holes and exact putts.<br/><br/>The rules were published in Games &amp; Puzzles $3 (July 1972). A sample hole is given; players are encouraged to make their own based on courses they like. Lists of the cards were made available by the magazine if you sent in for them.<br/><br/>",

Have you ever wanted to drunkenly race to the top a mountain while knocking your friends off? The correct answer is &quot;Every waking second!&quot; Basically, if you are over 21 (or 20 if you live in Iceland) the choice to buy this game is obvious. Bring this game to parties and it will instantly become a staple of all the parties thereafter.<br/><br/>A mix of dice rolling and strategy make an exciting, heart racing board game that is also a drinking game. You and your friends try to stop anyone from reaching the mountain-top before you. Each turn you roll the dice and push yourself or others up the mountain, in an attempt to reach the top and knock your others off. As you go up the mountain you lose and gain points on certain spaces and the game ends when someone reaches the top. If you go over the top you have to start all the way at the bottom.<br/><br/>Bottoms Up To The Top is a board game first and a drinking game second. Most drinking games seem to not be too much fun without the drinking, this game could easily be enjoyed no matter what state of mind you are in. Bottoms Up To The Top is a game for all kinds of people over the legal drinking age and not made exclusively for heavy-drinkers or moderate partyers. B.U.T.T. has separate rules for non-drinkers and drinkers.<br/><br/>",

To start, deal the cards evenly among all players, with players leaving those cards face down in front of them. Place one card face up in the center of the playing area; this forms the &quot;Fast Lane&quot;, and the final digit on this card (and each other card) is what's important during play.<br/><br/>Playing at the same time, everyone picks up and scans their cards, trying to find a legal play, specifically a card with a final digit one number higher or lower than the top card of the Fast Lane. As soon as someone plays such a card and announces the number of the card played, players must now find and play a card matching this new top card. If a player has a wild card, he can play it at anytime, announcing the number that it represents. The first player to play all of his cards wins, while the losing players must perform all of the exercises on the cards they are left holding. Anyone holding a wild card must perform their exercises twice!<br/><br/>For a speedier and wilder game, place two cards in the Fast Lane. Now everyone has two stacks on which to play!<br/><br/>",

Players start the game with a Tactical Deck of 10 cards, made up of 7 basic resource cards and 3 Solo Vigilante mission cards, and 80 Life Points.<br/><br/>During every turn, players draw 5 cards from their own Tactical Deck and use the 5 cards to acquire more powerful cards (Resources, Plans or Mission). Players may also play Plan or Mission cards if they are part of the 5 drawn cards. Plan cards help players complete Missions.<br/><br/>Playing a Mission card leads to a draw from the Warzone deck. If the player fulfills the requirements of the drawn Warzone card, he completes the mission and gains the Valour points and benefits listed on the card. A failed mission leads to loss of Life Points listed on the same card. Reaching 0 Life Points leads to the skipping of the next turn, and reduction of maximum Life Points by 20. When the maximum Life Points reaches 0, the player is out of the game.<br/><br/>The player with the highest number of Valour points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Coping is performed by rolling a large dodecahedron; the result may let the family member cope with the problem and advance, or it may require help from a family member at another growth level, in which case that member has to be moved.<br/><br/>Family members may get &quot;promoted&quot; to later growth levels. The levels are designated by plastic rings of different colors placed on the pieces.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to get all of your family members home first, but the real objective of the game is educational.

Through blind inspiration (drawing cards) and expert cut-and-paste editing (arranging cards on your board), you strive to complete your chapter before it's too late.<br/><br/>In the card game Invasive Species, players create a story by using 36 cards that have numbered text showing where each card should go in the story. Each turn, a player draws a card and decides whether he wants to keep it or give it to his opponent. He places any kept cards on his personal board, with the goal of creating an ascending numeral sequence. When the deck runs out, players take turns sliding misplaced cards into their correct positions.

Greg Stachowski added this information, &quot;The rocket looks to be pretty generic, perhaps based on a Kosmos. The spacecraft above each of the rockets is clearly a Vostok. Actually the artwork is damn good, those are pretty accurate renderings of all the spacecraft, even down to little details like the curved antennae on the Vostok or the hexagonal base frame on the Ranger (in fact given the accuracy of the others I might hazard a guess that it is a 1964 or later Ranger (6 through 9) due to the rectangular rather than trapezoidal panels).&quot; Greg's identification of the satellites is in a labeled image he prepared.<br/><br/>",

Players draw fortune cards with different combination of symbols, which they can choose to keep or swap for new ones. Based on the fortune cards in their hand, players take turns to place game tokens on the board and claim the fortunes on the corresponding cards. Most often, players have multiple board locations available and can choose their tactic based on the fortunes they most wish to claim and on the combinations that yield the highest number of points.

        "description": "Huey Leader puts you in the cockpits of the Vietnam War&rsquo;s best Close Air Support aircraft. In Huey Leader, fly search and destroy missions to attack enemy troops, fly missions to deploy US ground troops into hostile Landing Zones and then provide Close Air Support to help the troops complete their mission, and even fly resupply missions to keep US Forward Bases supplied.<br/><br/>Huey Leader is based on our popular Thunderbolt-Apache Leader game system. If you've played TAL, you'll be up and flying missions against the Vietcong in minutes.<br/><br/>The game places you in command of the pilots and aircraft of a squadron of U.S. Close Air Support (CAS) aircraft.<br/><br/>A major part of the game is mission planning. You decide how to arm your aircraft and which pilots are best for the mission. Pilots are rated for skill level. Deciding which pilots to fly each mission is a major consideration. Your pilots will become fatigued with every mission. If you fly a pilot too often, his skills will degrade. Your pilots also gain experience with every mission flown. This makes for some great decision-making. Should you keep flying the top pilots and further fatigue them to get the job done, or fly the new guys to prep them for the tough missions ahead?<br/><br/>Missions are quickly resolved using an area movement system to display tactical combat over the target. Speed and realism take top priority in this game. Terrain cards randomly generate each battlefield. The cards include mountain ranges that block lines of sight from both you and the enemy forces. If you plan it right, you get to fly nap of the earth through the canyons and come screaming over the ridgeline to rain fire down on the enemy before they can react. Beware! During each battle enemy air defenses will pop-up on the map to ruin your day, so watch were you&rsquo;re flying!<br/><br/>You get to resolve every shot taken at you by enemy AAA, and every air to ground attack you make against the enemy targets. Each enemy tank, APC, Infantry Squad, Machinegun Nest, etc is represented by its own counter on the battlefield.<br/><br/>While performing each mission, you get to decide how your pilots engage the enemy Vehicles, Troops, and AAA Sites. This makes for some tough choices. Do you hit the high value targets first, or take out the enemy AAA assets first?<br/><br/>Your aircraft are usually able to survive more than one attack. These aircraft are rugged and made to soak-up damage. This also factors into your decision-making. How long should you loiter over the target blowing-up enemy targets before heading for home? If your aircraft is too shot-up, it may not be able to fly for days.<br/><br/>Huey Leader features an operation combat sheet that tracks the progress of enemy formations attempting to overrun your sector. You get to select the formation you want to engage each day and assign the air assets you think are best suited to the task.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve included the cards for every pilot to progress in experience from Newbie, to Green, Average, Skilled, Veteran, and Ace!<br/><br/>Key Design Features: <br/>An all-around excellent solitaire game. <br/>Manage your pilots as well as your hardware to be a successful squadron commander. <br/>Intuitive, fast-playing game system.<br/><br/>Huey Leader includes the following aircraft:<br/>UH-1 Iroquois<br/>CH-47 Chinook<br/>AH-1 Cobra<br/>OH-6 Cayuse<br/>A-1 Skyraider<br/>AC-47 Spooky<br/><br/>Component List:<br/>165 Full Color Cards<br/>2 Full Color Counter Sheets (352 counters)<br/>3 Full Color Counter Sheets with Terrain Hexes (18 counters)<br/>22&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; Full Color Tactical Sheet<br/>1 Full Color Air Base Sheet<br/>1 Full Color Player Log Sheet<br/><br/>Scheduled Campaign List:<br/>Westmoreland's War 1/1965<br/>Operation Hump 10/1965<br/>Khe Sanh 1/1968<br/>Tet Offensive 1/1968<br/>Easter Offensive 3/1972<br/>And more!<br/><br/>Target Audience: <br/>This game is perfect for both expert level military gamers as well as first time gamers. The core rules are easy to grasp and very intuitive, while still giving players a wide variety of decision-making options and tactical choices.<br/><br/>Each mission requires only in 30 to 60 minutes.<br/><br/>Each campaign consists of 2 to 10 Days in which you&rsquo;ll fly one or more missions each Day.<br/><br/>",

The game represents a vast journey across the entire world of Thexia. During the game players will capture monsters of their own which they will train. There is no limit to how powerful your monster can become! They will face several encounters like Duelers, Bandits, wild monsters, traps, and other challenges. As they travel between the regions they will discover ancient dungeons filled with rare monsters and treasure. Players will also complete quests that earn them fame which increases their chances of being chosen to be a Guild member. The game can be played competitively or semi-cooperatively if players want to team up against each other to speed the journey along.<br/><br/>The game is divided into basic and advanced versions. The basic version is much faster to play and simply requires removing a few components and not using some of the content such as the monsters unique abilities. The advanced version is played using all components and takes about 2 hours to play. There are also components that allow for custom character creation which allow a player to save their information to continue playing again possibly using expansions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A simple and quick game of dice rolling set in a fictional Japanese role-playing game called Bravura Burst. The game is played with two sets of unique six-sided dice. The first set of five dice have six different role-playing attributes on them such as strength or charisma. The other set of dice represent the six different types of jobs the heroes in your party can have based on the attributes they rolled. There are also Fool dice for characters that could not get a job.<br/><br/>On the first four turns, players will roll the five attribute dice up to 3 times in an attempt to give one of their four heroes a job (such as rolling at least three strength to create a Barbarian, or two intelligence and two charisma to create a Summoner). Among the six available job dice there are 24 unique jobs (and one more for the unique Fool Die) to play with.<br/><br/>Once everyone has rolled up their individual parties of four, they have a competition against a deck of cards that represents monsters and traps in a dungeon. They do this by drawing the top card of the dungeon deck and rolling the dice representing their party up to three times against the numbers and tricks on the card. The player is trying to roll enough damage to defeat the monster and enough blocking or healing to stop as much damage as possible. Traps works slightly differently with the party trying to disarm them with either job dice that can do so, or by trying to roll various specific combinations of attribute Dice to manually disarm them. Once they make their final roll for the turn they add up the numbers and see what they scored.<br/><br/>The competition is score based with a very simple system. Players gain 1 point for killing monsters and disarming traps, and another point if they can end the turn having blocked or healed all the damage that monster or trap just did. If a player can both defeat a card and block or heal all the damage in the same turn they gain 3 points instead.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Immortal Saga is a collectible competitive card game set in the distant past on ancient Earth. The gods have discovered an unbound power that they receive through human worship, and they thirst for it more than anything else in the universe. We were once used to collect raw materials for the divine sky-chariots to haul away into the heavens, we were nothing more than creatures created by the gods for slave labor&hellip; until the divining occurred.<br/><br/>We rebelled against the creators. Fed up with our defiance and costly ignorance, the golden ones ascended into the heavens, much to our surprise. Then, slowly at first but with increasing frequency, our children were born with gifts. We learned that the gods wanted to apologize and through freeing us from their whips and even granting our children the power of the ascended, the beings we once dreaded, were loved as fathers and mothers. We came to accept them as divine beings, for does not a father or mother disciple their children before they are allowed to make decisions that affect their lives? The gods are benevolent and we even have come to depend upon their charity.<br/><br/>All they ask is for our worship and the rains shall fall, the crops shall grow and we shall be at peace&hellip; or so we thought. Without worship, the gods cannot function and if one loves their god and their way of life, they will fight for it. So, our leaders, mortals and Immortals alike, have created vast armies to spread the word of our benefactors, the supreme beings that rule over us, like omniscient parents.<br/><br/>The characters are played by Immortals that have been gifted by their god&rsquo;s, powers of immense potential and limitless possibility. For their gifts, the gods require the Immortal peoples to pontificate the benevolence of the heavenly-ones through words, actions and deeds. Some Immortals find that politics of leadership and the courts are their strong-suit but more often than not, they take to the fields of battle to vanquish the antithesis of their deities. Killing mortals and Immortals, the demi-gods of war shall know no bounds and shall be bound only by their master&rsquo;s will.<br/><br/>Players create characters through an easy but in-depth creation process. Each character has a school where he learned to use his powers, skills that he picked up to help him during his adventures, techniques which are the moves he uses to engage his foes, equipment to deal damage and blunt attacks, and of course his deck of power. Characters move upon a semi-randomized board as they try to knock their opponents out cold.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Alien Attack! is a strategy board game for 2-4 players that pits them against an impending alien invasion - and each other. A ground war with the aliens seems inevitable as the first waves of enemies approach. Players take the role of weapons development companies seeking a contract with the Earth Defense Force.<br/><br/>Defeating aliens gets you brownie points, but sloppy work will let the next player sweep up the wounded remains. Balance subterfuge and self-promotion while blowing up aliens to claim ultimate victory!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t=========The game is comprised of multiple player rounds over the course of three waves of invading aliens, with the starting player rotating between each. At the start of each round, cards can be played to give an advantage or disadvantage to yourself or other players for the duration of the round. Most player-to-player sabotage happens at this time, so players go into their turns aware of what odds might be stacked against them.<br/><br/>Once a round has begun, players each do the following as a complete turn:<br/><br/>- Receive energy tokens and event cards;<br/>- Commit energy tokens to their weapons;<br/>- Use event cards for their action, or as currency for upgrading weapons or hiring employees;<br/>- Fire charged weapons into a 3x3 grid of aliens.<br/><br/>Each weapon has its own targeting system and damage types, with stronger weapons needing more energy to fire. Each alien has their own Rock-Paper-Scissors style strengths and weaknesses against damage types.<br/><br/>Players keep alien corpses for end-game points, but can trade them for additional event cards on the Black Market. Weapon upgrades and employees also provide points at the end of the game, but on a handicap system - more points are awarded for weaker weapons or poor employees, awarding clever strategy over pure luck.<br/><br/>The game typically ends when the Wave III deck empties and the 3x3 grid can no longer be stocked, but there are a few conditions where all players lose if they can't coordinate their efforts well enough!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Alien Overlords, a sci-fi strategy game, players control fleets of starships and attempt to conquer or destroy the 24 planets on the game map. Players start with only one or two planets. Gobble up as many Neutral Planets as you can before enemy players' ships threaten your planets and Home World.<br/><br/>Before play begins, each player picks technologies and bonuses that influence their strategy for the game. The game features three classes of starships: Frigates, Cruisers and Battleships. Frigates are cheap to build, Cruisers move the fastest, and Battleships dish out the most damage. Planets are also of three sizes according to the resource value of that planet. Custom average dice are used for battles, allowing an element of chance while making it difficult to win or lose by luck alone.<br/><br/>Focusing on combat and strategic movement rather than resource management, Alien Overlords plays quickly. Technologies are chosen at the start of the game rather than researched during the game. If a ship is damaged it either explodes or repairs itself so that players do not have to keep track of damage. Over 50 unique, interesting, and sometimes funny Situation Cards give temporary bonuses or allow players to steal from, sabotage or destroy enemy forces.<br/><br/>Alien Overlords allows freedom of ship movement across the map rather than using &quot;space lanes.&quot; There is only one type of Resource to manage, an income based on the planets under a player's control. Number and locations of planets on the game map can be adjusted to suit the number of players, the desired game length, and for variety.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the elegance of chess, checkers, and go, and inspired by the beauty of deep space, DeltaV is the game of spatial combat.<br/><br/>Someday, humanity will harness enough energy to become a starfaring species. But what then? Will we explore the stars, united? Or will humanity fragment into the bubble of space around the Solar System? We're apparently alone in the galaxy, and if we turn inward, against each other, the war will be more frightening than any fought so far.<br/><br/>In the game of DeltaV, you can find out if you have what it takes to survive spatial combat. Fight against one to five other fleet commanders over a region of space. Deceivingly simple, the DeltaV board contains only as many positions as a standard checkerboard. But in three dimensions, those positions can have much greater significance.<br/><br/>One board supports up to six players, and multiple boards may be combined for even larger battles.<br/><br/>",

The game has a hidden strength factor the effectively simulates the raw, unseasoned troops in the actual battle.  There are also provisions for artillery fire, and terrain modifiers.  Victory is obtained by eliminating the opposing player's 6 strength General, two 3 strength generals or all the enemy troops.

A chesimal that has lost its brain can no longer move, although the remaining units of the chesimal stay on the board, blocking friendly pieces and subject to capture by enemy pieces.<br/><br/>The game, an introduction to the idea of chesimals and activators, is played on a 16x24 board, with 32 units per side forming 4 chesimals. Each chesimal is a mix of 3 different short range chesslike units, each of which moves differently. Two of the chesimals are &quot;royal&quot; units, consisting of a royal brain, 2 knights, and 4 &quot;men&quot;, pieces that move like a king but are not royal. The other 2 pieces contain a brain, 4 men, and 4 rooklike or 4 bishoplike pieces, which only move 1 or 2 squares/turn.<br/><br/>Players alternate turns, moving 1 chesimal/turn. The object of the game is to capture your opponent's 2 royal brain units before losing both of yours.<br/><br/>",

Especially when there are Goblins stealing your equipment, Undead hunting in the catacombs and Mayhex! magic getting in the way.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Each pack consists of a deck of 108 unique cards.<br/><br/>Every card has two dice (scores ranging from 2 to 12) and a coin (either a Head or Tails) printed on it (to enable you to Dice Duel or Coin Duel). You don't require anything else to play.<br/><br/>Mayhex!'s 108 unique playing cards consist of Positive Cards, Negative Cards, Action Cards, Mayhex! Cards, Infection Cards, and Uninfected Cards.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Like any good card game, Mayhex! requires both skill and a touch of luck to win.<br/><br/>At the start of your turn you must select a card from the Well. You must play one card from your Hand on either yourself, into the Pit or more enjoyably into another player's Lab.<br/><br/>How your friends will laugh when you make them Dice Duel to see if their entire Hand must be placed directly into the Pit or maybe you&rsquo;ll give them minus 25 points or better yet, an Infected Card.<br/><br/><br/><br/>We'll be uploading how to play Mayhex! tutorial videos to the Thornway Games website in late February 2015.

Occupying the center of the board are four large square safe zones where pieces may move and not be captured.  Nine pieces per player are used, in red, white, blue and gold, with their starting positions marked on two rows of squares close to each side of the board.  The game may be played individually or in partnership, and is essentially the same as Checkers but for the extra players and safe zones.  Capture is compulsory when not in the safe zones.  Promotion occurs by reaching the opposite end of the board.  Last player with pieces remaining wins the game.<br/><br/>",

First player places a card (by choice or randomly) on the left side of the game board, next player (clockwise) places a card (also by choice or randomly) on the right side of the game board. Now the first player rolls the MathDice.<br/><br/>As soon as the dice cup is lifted an equation is revealed. All players calculate the result and then try to find it among all of the answer cards spread over the table. He or she who finds the answer first grabs the card and places it next to him/her in such a way that all players may reach it. The answer card now constitutes one point.<br/><br/>Once the answer card has been found the dice cup is passed on to the next player (still clockwise), the played cards are removed from the game board and a new turn begins.<br/><br/>Should an answer that has already been taken by a player come out again, everyone may try to steal that answer. Again fastest hand wins. If a player grabs an answer card that he or she has already has by his/her side, a special card is given to remember that extra point.<br/><br/>The game is over when all cards have been played. The winner is the one with the most answer cards. In case of equality the digits on the answering cards are counted, higher number wins (i.e. &quot;2&quot; is one digit and &quot;1.25&quot; is three digits).<br/><br/>To sum up the idea of the game:<br/>Finding the answer was easy - but where is it?<br/><br/>",

Each player starts the game (sitting across the board from one another facing a long side of the board) with 12 stones placed in the nearest row, 10 identical pieces starting one each on all spaces except the two corners each of which is occupied by an activator. A supply of neutral colored stones and of additional pieces in the player's own color (designated white and black) are also needed.<br/><br/>All stones move like rooks in chess, i.e., vertically or horizontally in an unobstructed line.<br/><br/>The object is to create a situation where one has at least twice as many pieces on the board as one's opponent or where the opponent has no legal move. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>What's notable here is the use of two activator pieces based on an a notion created by designer Joe Joyce, as per the contest mentioned above. This allows captured pieces to be removed from play, converted to immobile neutral pieces or replaced by a piece of one's own color, depending on how they are captured.<br/><br/>",

Choose your skier and your equipment wisely, avoid the pit traps and skier attacks, deal some damage yourself, and plan the smartest course. Do this, and you may just win the game.<br/><br/>Players score points for speed and points for pain. Do one. Do the other. DO BOTH! Players score 1 point for each point of damage dealt and 1 point for each space they are ahead of the last place skier at the end of the game when a skier crosses the finish line.<br/><br/>",

But not every hiding place actually contains loot so the players help Capt'n Sharky to find out where the gems are.<br/><br/>Players move their pirate pawns along the row of island tiles by playing one of six movement cards. The card hand is repleneished only after all cards have been played. Whenever a pirate lands on an empty tile he gets to place the treasure chest on the tile and opens it to checks whether he's found something. When all gems have been found, the player with the most gems is the winner.<br/><br/>A variant requires players to catapult the gems into the ship's hold in order to score them.<br/><br/>The island tiles and the treasure chest use magnets to make the chest display different symbols when it is placed on a tile.<br/><br/>This game is basically a smaller carry-along version of Capt'n Sharky: Abenteuer auf der Schatzinsel with a few differences in implementation.<br/><br/>",

Important regional sub-centers of some countries are also connected to the network. Existing train connections are shown on the schedule as rails.<br/><br/>The goal is to create a train through Europe, and only through team work can players hope to achieve this challenge. Each player takes the role of the Minister of Transport of the EC countries. In the EC, the ministers meet regularly in the Council of Ministers of Transport. The Common Community Commission proposes the construction of a particular route. The European Parliament may accept this proposal or reject it. This also applies to the Transport Ministers Council, which will decide after discussing the planning and financing of the track.<br/><br/>Any Minister of Transport can try to fund the project through national budgetary resources, which he can invest in the construction of the Euro-train. In addition, the Transport Ministers Council may fall back in the game on loans from the European Investment Bank (EIB) and funds from the EC transport budget.<br/><br/>Until all the capitals of the community are linked by the Euro-Express, the Council has to overcome many hurdles and crack many hard nuts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "VludKin ClaNz is a card game for two players about the struggle of the VludKin for control over the Vlud, the energy upon which their world is built. Each player starts with two VludKin cards from different ClaNz, and their goal is to not have the lowest influence VludKin when the game ends, and therefore be the player controlling the Vlud.<br/><br/>This is an original &quot;stack-building&quot; card game for two players, with a set of rules that are quick and simple to learn, but offering numerous strategic options and dirty tricks on the path to victory.<br/><br/>Each player receives two random VludKin cards from different ClaNz, and during the game they draw a card from the central deck which they then try to win with one of their VludKin, rolling over that VludKin's Influence modified by the card. If this card is an Influence card, they can then place it under one of the VludKin, altering their Influence value based on the Clan type shown on the card. If it's a Power card, then they can carry out the special action on that card before it is discarded.<br/><br/>Failing to win a card will earn the VludKin a -1 Influence token to their total, and they can get rid of these only through trading an Influence card matching their Clan or the use of certain power cards, which might actually move all the tokens to an enemy instead. If an Influence card is failed, then the other player gets a chance to win it. If a Power card is failed, then the power is automatically played by the enemy VludKin opposite; sometimes it's in your advantage to fail a Power card...<br/><br/>During the game, the stacks of cards under each VludKin are built, changing their Influence up and down over turns until the game ends and the player with the lowest VludKin loses. With the ability to play Influence cards on the other player's VludKin and with the use of Power cards to move Influence cards around the stacks, a level of strategy is added to the simple core rules.<br/><br/>The game ends when either a VludKin reaches ten Influence or the central deck is empty, so through the use of Influence and Power cards a tense game builds in which the balance of Influence can change right up to the end on the asymmetrical board game playfield. There is little down time for the players and no hidden hands of cards, so this provides an exciting head-to-head experience.<br/><br/>VludKin ClaNz comes with eight VludKin from four ClaNz, two copies of each of the twelve different power cards, and forty Influence cards. Adding extra sets of the Power and Influence cards gives you the option to customize the central deck to how you want to play, and also gives the option for a longer game.<br/><br/>Can you gain influence over the VludKin in this original card game?<br/><br/>",

Each player then places his first eight mice in a 3x3 grid with the middle square left empty. The neutral mice are kept as a hand of cards.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he can move one mouse one step. A mouse that moves into the middle empty square has escaped, and the opponent's mouse with the same number is defeated (turned over). Each mouse has a special ability that affects only the two adjacent mice; for example, the fighter mouse protects the adjacent mice from being defeated, the nurse mouse heals a defeated mouse, the speed mouse allows adjacent mice to move twice, and so on. Each time a mouse exits, the active player can place a neutral mouse from his hand on one of the corner squares, if available.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players receive one point per escaped mouse, but some of the mice give an extra bonus depending on the order in which they escaped. This order is determined by the two neutral mice set aside at the start of the game.<br/><br/>",

Dogma is a party-style card game simulating the back-and-forth dialogue between roleplayers and the game master in an RPG session.<br/><br/>Each player selects a team of heroes from the available line-up, then receives six quest cards and a number of play cards that signify dice numbers.<br/><br/>Taking turns, players ask an opponent for a quest; that player unveils one of his quests, then the asking player tries to solve the quest by rolling as many dice as he has heroes, activating their abilities to generate resources such as &quot;battle&quot;, &quot;magic&quot;, &quot;thievery&quot; and so on. Each quest has its own clear requirements, and if the player manages to generate the correct resources, he gains the victory points the quest generates; if not, these points go to the quest owner.<br/><br/>After the dice roll, players can adjust the values of the dice by playing cards from their hands, either elevating, lowering or re-rolling the dice rolled. After this is done, the dice are applied to the lineup of heroes, activating different abilities.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Its not easy to be a Master of Evil. The working hours suck... Finding efficient minions is a pain... and keeping your well-earned treasure safe from the hands of the so called &quot;Heroes&quot; ends up being a full-time job. But... this is YOUR JOB and fame in the Inner Circle of Evil is everything to you so why not show the other Masters how a demonic job is really done! Masters of Evil is a game for 1 to 6 players where each player takes the role of an Evil Master that is repelling the attack of a variety of heroes trying to gain as much reputation as possible by imprisoning the heroes when defeated.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game 5 hero cards are dealt to each player so 3 can be chosen. Those heroes will be attacking your Den. Each turn a Monster is Summoned and you will have to place one of your minion tokens on one of your heroes that have that monster symbol. If you complete a card by filling all the monster, traps, and spells symbols you defeat that hero and can claim it as a reward by imprisoning him/her into your dungeon cell. Some heroes provide a special reward when defeated... from adding an extra monster to getting a special Overlord ability.<br/><br/>After placing minions a die is rolled to determine if a type of hero attacks. To repel an attack you can remove monsters from that hero card for a value equal, bigger or lower than the hero attack (defined by the roll of 1D6). If you repel the complete attack you are undamaged. If you repel a portion you can get the rest of the damage by reducing your life (which begins with 10). Also you can simply nullify the attack of a hero by distracting them with one of your treasures. Spells can be used to change the summoned monster type and Traps can nullify any attack (even if they are not in the card of an attacking hero).<br/><br/>When the 6th hero is collected by any player the game is over and the scoring phase begins. Players get the points in the hero cards but also get points for the most types of each monster and if they collect at least 3 cards of a Hero Type.<br/><br/><br/>No es facil ser un Se&ntilde;or del Mal. Las horas a las que hay que levantarse apestan... Encontrar sirvientes eficientes es un dolor de medula... Y conservar tu &quot;bien merecido&quot; tesoro de las garras de los heroes termina siendo un trabajo full-time. Pero es tu OFICIO y la fama adquirida en el circulo Interno de la Maldad lo es todo para ti... asi que porque no mostrar a los demas Se&ntilde;ores como se hace un buen trabajo demoniaco! En los Se&ntilde;ores del Mal los jugadores toman el rol de Se&ntilde;ores Oscuros que estan repeliendo el ataque de audaces heroes aprisionandolos cuando son derrotados para asi ganar la tan preciada fama.<br/><br/>Al comienzo del juego se entregaran 5 cartas de heroe a cada jugador de las que seran elegidas 3. Esos heroes atacaran tu Guarida. Cada turno sera Invocado un Monstruo y tendras que colocar un token de minion en uno de los heroes que tenga en su carta a dicho monstruo disponible. Si completas todos los slots de la carta derrotas al heroe y puedes reclamar la recompensa aprisionandolo en una celda. Algunos heroes proveen recompensas especiales cuando son derrotados... desde otorgar un monstruo extra a darle al Overlord una habilidad permanente.<br/><br/>Luego de colocar los minions se tira un dado para determinar el tipo de heroe que atacara. Para repeler un ataque se pueden remover monstruos de la carta de dicho heroe por un valor igual, superior o inferior que el ataque del heroe (definido por un D6). Si repeles completamente el ataque no eres da&ntilde;ado. Si solo se repele una porcion recibes el resto del da&ntilde;o reduciendo tu vida (que comienza en 10). Tambien puedes anular un ataque entregandole uno de tus tesoros. Los hechizos pueden ser usados para invocar un monstruo diferente del que se ha invocado y las Trampas anulan cualquier ataque (incluso si no estan en la carta del heroe atacante)<br/><br/>Cuando un jugador aprisiona a su sexto heroe el juego termina y comienza la ronda de puntaje. Los jugadores obtienen puntos por cada heroe capturado, pero tambien por mayoria de determinado tipo de monstruo y variedad de heroes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Deductio is a French card game for 2-8 players.<br/><br/>The rules of the game<br/><br/>Beginner<br/><br/>Choose the number of cards you want to play with. To start, 3 cards per player are dealt.<br/><br/>Example : you have 3 players and you decide to play with 3 cards. Take the numbered cards from 1 to 10. Mix them up, and distribute them face down. The last card is placed onto the table.<br/><br/>The oldest player begins. He multiplies a couple of his cards and then announces the result.<br/><br/>Example : the first player has cards 2, 5 and 8. Consequently he can associate 3 couples of cards : 2 and 5, 2 and 8, 5 and 8. He chose the first and declares : &quot;10&quot;.<br/><br/>His opponents have to deduce which couple it is.<br/><br/>Example : to obtain 10, you can either have the 2 and the 5, or the 1 and the 10. In that case, the second player has the 1 : thus he validates the first hypothesis.<br/><br/>Players take turns in a clockwise direction declaring a multiple, until one player has identified which card is on the table. He says &quot;Deductio&quot; and declares the number of the hidden card without showing the card to the others. If he is right, he scores a point. If he can identify the cards in each player's hand without any mistake, he scores a bonus point, and the hand is over. If he is wrong, he loses 1 point and the hand goes on.<br/><br/>The first player to score 10 points wins the game.<br/><br/>Experienced<br/><br/>Play with 4 cards or more following the same rules. The number of possible couples (for example, 6 couples for 4 cards) and the multiples related to each value increase.<br/><br/>In turns, each player can play the joker card. He puts it in front of him and turns it face down once used. It will allow him to pass his turn once without declaring any number. It can be played at any time.<br/><br/>",

In that sense, it will be something new for many boardgamers.<br/><br/>Using a slight variation of Ye Olde Igo-Hugo play sequence, the game system highlights the firepower of the British Martini Henry rifle, the value of a solid defensive position, and the greatly superior numbers of the three Zulu Amibutho (divisions) that gave them something like 40-1 numerical superiority at times. And all of this without having to move hundreds of counters around, another innovation. The map scale is 1&rdquo; = 4 yards. All of which plays in a couple of hours.<br/><br/>",

Question order is determined based on where a player lands on the board using a die roll. Once all six chips have been obtained, the player moves to a leprechaun space in the center of the board and answers a question in the category of their opponent's choosing.  Once this is answered correctly, the player must return to their start space and answer another question of the category that matches the start space color.

The game ends -and the counting of victory points starts- whenever a player's population reaches zero, four recruitment piles are empty or a player has lost his last hero token.<br/><br/>The game is played by two players or any multiple of two, using an extra copy of the game for each extra pair of players. When more than two players are around the table, Marches of Mists is played as a team battle with phases of interaction between allies known as Councils; it is an epic experience that needs perfect knowledge of the game's cards and strategies, especially when more than four players are involved.<br/><br/>Set in a singular fantasy world, Marches of Mists is currently illustrated by Camille Mazauric and it is the first game developed by Bruno Gaia with the help of Youri Faja, the designer of &quot;Requiem&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is a trivia game bearing the name of Myron Cope, former color commentator for the Pittsburgh Steelers.<br/><br/>The instructions say this game is to be played while watching football, and when &quot;your favorite team&quot; does good things listed in the instructions (touchdown, interception of other team, first down, etc) to spin the spinner and contribute a chip of the color of the region to a kitty. There are 6 regions, 2 of each color red, yellow or blue.  However, on half of the six regions, one for each color, the spinning player is supposed to also take trivia cards, and save them until a commercial break or a penalty in which that player will be asked the questions by the player to his left. For each question the player answers he gets chips from the other players if correct, gives chips if incorrect. The color of the chips exchanged are based on the difficulty of the trivia question, with yellow being the easiest , red in the middle, and blue the hardest. Once the questions are asked, play rotates to the next player to be in charge of the spinner during the next bit of football action. Chips are given and gotten, but no one is ever eliminated, just the balance of chips sways. Player in charge of the spinner when time expires also gets the contents of the kitty being collected through the game.  Chips won from the various rounds of trivia, as well as the kitty are totaled.  The chips yellow, red and blue are worth 1,2,and 3 point respectively.  Player with the most chips is the winner.<br/><br/>Having heard sports commentators, including Myron, I believe this game is supposed to feel like being a color commentator, where during the football game you do not say much, but then when nothing is happening, the color commentator sweeps in with his trivia, stories, or other banter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game of robot combat for 2 &ndash; 4 players<br/><br/>Robot Combat is a game of arena-style robot combat.<br/><br/>In Robot Combat you randomly pick a combat style robot, which you will maintain, upgrade and fight within the Robot Combat arena. You start with a basic level 1 combat robot and your goal is to improve upon your robot design by upgrading to the strongest level 3 robot and winning the championship. You can do this by winning auctions for new or used robot parts or winning a robot combat match! <br/>You are given a chassis type, an initial drive train, armor, a weapon systems, a motor system, and 12 voltage batteries for each system; everything! During phases of the game you can either bid on new types of Robot Parts for a better deal OR bid on used parts directly from players.<br/><br/>You begin with a small amount of funds to help you upgrade your robot. When you are ready and your robot is fully functional, you can place your robot on the competition circuit and fight against other robots for prizes or money! In the end there can only be one combat champion robot!<br/><br/>During combat you will use movement cards to control your robot's drive system within the combat arena to help maneuver your robot into the best fighting position with your weapon. Watch out though, as you move or get knocked around the arena, the combat arena has offensive and defensive weapon systems of its own such as; spikes, ramps, saws, lifters, hammers, etc... these systems try to destroy or inhibit your robot! If your robot becomes immobile, you lose and the match is over!<br/><br/>The combat arena is a hex style attack grid.<br/><br/>As you move your robot around the arena you will try to make contact with your opponent which will cause either LIGHT, MEDIUM, OR HEAVY damage.  The damage to your opponent&rsquo;s robot will depend on the level of your weapon or the level of the robot!  Also, when you make contact you can cause different issues with the robots such as; power failure, loss of control, loss of maneuverability, electronic failure, motor failure, battery failure, etc...   These different issues will cause robot part to breakdown.  When a breakdown occurs, you can repair the part or replace it with another part.  Each part has a life span and can only be repaired once, the second time the part breaks down it&rsquo;s destroyed!<br/><br/>Robot Combat is a turn-based system with rounds and phases. In between matches you will be able to sell or buy new or used parts for your robot to help fix or repair the broken parts before the next match; if you can't fix your robot before the next match, you will have to sit out of the competition until your robot is fully functional.<br/><br/>Winning each match earns you a trophy and money or parts, if you can upgrade your robot to the highest level and win the most matches; you will earn glory and prestige to become the Robot Combat Champion!<br/><br/>",

Each player gets dealt 2 cards (as in poker).<br/><br/>The first choice is do you use a QJP tile? This will change 1 or both of your starting cards. You can then choose to use your Joker. If you play your Joker and you end the round with the best hand you win an extra Heart Tile. If you have the worst hand, then you don't lose a heart tile.<br/><br/>The hand then plays out, as it would in poker, however, hands  are all revealed so everybody can see what people have. There is no gambling. You all see how everybody gets on. Then the player with the worst hand, loses a heart. If you lose all your hearts then you are out. Last player standing wins.<br/><br/>Although the game uses a poker mechanic, it differs as all players show their hand, so there is no gambling. It turns it into a co-operative game style with lots of players hoping one will do badly. It also differs from poker with the use of the QJP, Joker and Heart based structure, which are tokens/tiles and not gambling chips.<br/><br/>",

Those starting from routes A or B are Allied Agents. Those starting from Route C are the Gestapo.<br/><br/>The game is a simple roll and move game where you must follow instructions on special squares. Unusually for these type of games, if you land on the same space as another player, you must &quot;fight to the death&quot;. Each player rolls one die repeatedly until one player rolls a six. That player 'kills' the other player. A &quot;Dead Man&quot;  is out of the game. First to reach the HQ wins.<br/><br/>",

Upon entering each of the four temples, the player must defeat the Temple Guardian and return the funerary jars to the King's Treasury &mdash; all before Khepri raises the new sun.<br/><br/>Carter's Quest is solitaire tile-laying adventure game set in the 1920s. Portraying the world-famous archaeologist Howard Carter, the player lays tiles beginning at the King's Treasury and must find the four funerary jars and return them to the Treasury before the sun rises. Along the way, the player will collect weapons and provisions to help defend himself from the wrath of the deadly, sometimes poisonous, creatures inhabiting Tutankhamen's tomb. Find the jars, return them to the Treasury and save the world. Otherwise, you're devoured by the Pharaoh's curse.<br/><br/>Carter's Quest is a variant of Zombie in my Pocket, but this game employs a unique, dice-rolling combat system in which the items a player finds are used to modify the combat roll. Players are also at risk of being poisoned by some of the creatures in the game and will need to find the antidote or rest in the Priest's Temple; otherwise they will be consumed by the toxins and lose the game.<br/><br/>",

Kids make signals out the back window, just hoping to hear that horn blast away as the trucker goes by and we benefit everyday from these massive machines moving goods and materials from coast to coast over the maze of our highways.  Hauler is a game dedicated to the Big Rig Trucker in all of us!<br/><br/>Hauler is a game for 2-5 players where the goal is to build a deck of resources that will give you the most victory points.  VPs are earned on cards or by running routes off of route cards purchased with Green Stamps (Money in Trucker Lingo).  Green Stamps are earned playing cards out of your hand each turn.  Green stamps can be used on your turn to purchase route cards, truck cards, fuel cards or action cards.<br/><br/>The rules of the game are complex.  Think of Hauler as part deck builder and part strategy board game.  Each turn a player can drive up to 12 hours each turn per truck or you draw 5 cards from their deck and purchase additional cards based on the green stamp value of the cards in play. Of course, there are complications and strategy to be had, as other players may be eyeing the same route you just passed on picking up, or may get to a hitchhiker before you if you take an extra deckbuilding turn. The decision is yours, and makes for great strategic conundrums in this 90-120 minute game.<br/><br/>",

Afterwards the King will order hunt Werewolves or Vampires. Hunters will think first to retire or not to retire. If they decide to hunt, they must fight with the beast orders by the King. Queen will be a partnership of the King.<br/><br/>",

A powerful German panzerkorps has a combat power of 4, and German units have step reduction.  The airwar is abstracted as in BC, and there is a Katyushas (rocket) unit.<br/><br/>The combat odds round-off (including UP) and expansion rule is retained from Barbarossa's Climax, as are other rules, but much more playably in the smaller - more introductory level - format.<br/><br/>The game is free to print off, assemble, and play.<br/><br/>",

Every capture results in a pillar being erected on the square where the capture took place. Pillars belong to the captor and move as chess queens. They can neither capture nor move over pieces.<br/><br/>Stacks can be split or joined. Whether a stack is vulnerable to capture is determined by the number of adjacent squares. Pillars take away such squares and thus heighten vulnerability of adjacent stacks.<br/><br/>A player wins by eliminating all of the opponent's stacks from the board (regardless of any reserves either player might have in hand) or by leaving his opponent without a legal move. Cooperative cycles are inherently possible, but in regular play the game will seldom end in a draw.<br/><br/>The game can be played using simple generic material: a chess board, draughtsmen, and chess pawns to represent pillars.<br/><br/>",

Each player then takes it in turns to play a card of the same colour until each player has played one card to end the turn.<br/><br/>The next turn begins with the player who player the highest card on the last go and continues until players have no cards left in their hand.  However if you don't have a card of the current colour you can play any card you want and force the player who has played the current highest to pick up all the cards in play.<br/><br/>",

Then the trapper rolls the die and places that many fences on the board in the slots between squares. There are 5 total fences in the game. Once all fences have been placed, the trapper must use the already placed fences.<br/><br/>The game ends when either the rat cannot move, or the rat reaches a cheese square on the opposite end of the board.<br/><br/>The d6 is missing, so I'm unsure of its marks, but the instructions indicate that it has at least 1 blank spot, and it's reasonable to assume it goes no higher than 3, since a higher roll would be an automatic win for the trapper.<br/><br/>",

They handle armoured vehicles, gunships, power armour, aliens, humanoids, bugs, robots&hellip;<br/><br/>A player shoots and/or moves a unit or individual/model, then rolls to see if he can activate another unit that round, and so on until a roll to get another unit to act fails, then the other player has a round. The chance of getting 2+ units to respond in a round depends on the motivation, communications and the like for the unit/individual/model involved... but it a case of shoot first, then move, then combat.<br/><br/>Morale includes a form of pinning/going prone as a voluntary action against incoming fire to reduce the risk of, erm, death, and the main element is that all units/individuals/models start to test once a certain level of casualties have been sustained by your army (not per unit). Level of losses at which you test is worse for militia-type units, better for regulars and much better for special forces.<br/><br/>A points system is included in the rules, as well as ideas for linking games from one to another.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Palatine is a social strategy game that takes place during the decline of the ancient Roman Republic. Players take on the roles of noble families jockeying for power amidst increasing corruption and unrest.<br/><br/>Gameplay consists of players bidding against each other on a randomly ordered selection of cards, then playing those cards. Cards represent opportunities for advancement in Roman high society, such as the acquisition of government positions, the leading of military campaigns, or the construction of public works. Cards tend to grant players tokens  &mdash; influence, denarii or legions &mdash; and those tokens are used in bidding for more cards.<br/><br/>Victory can be achieved either by acquiring a predetermined number of legion tokens and storming Rome or by having the most influence tokens of any player when the deck has been exhausted.<br/><br/>The game allows for strategy as confined by the luck of the deck's shuffle as well as trading, player cooperation and player competition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the not too distant future the hydrocarbons have run out! But not to worry, because nuclear power is here and it&rsquo;s totally safe&hellip; honest. Sure there have been some mishaps along the way, but today&rsquo;s super clean super efficient nuclear powerplants are a true wonder of modern science.  The technology has come so far so fast that it has left a trail of obsolete and faulty industrial sites in its wake. Don&rsquo;t worry though these relics of the nuclear revolution are nothing to be concerned about.  They&rsquo;re mostly away from the populated safe-zones, they&rsquo;re guarded by very competent Securobot staff and in a lot of them rad-levels are approaching acceptable.  It&rsquo;s in these crumbling industripolis that we find our setting for Atom Raider.<br/><br/>Atom Raiders are the dregs of society, a kind of Atomic scavenger they trawl dead powerplants for the old unstable and yet very lucrative fissionable material.  Mostly it&rsquo;s locked away in huge old reactor stores and normally guarded by the stupid but formidable securobots.  The only law force that can put up with those kind of rad-levels for more than a few shifts.<br/><br/>In Atom Raider misdirection is the name of the game. Infiltrating players guide their stealthy Raiders through the darkened maze of corridors using subterfuge, bluffs, feigns and cunning to be the first to reach the reactor doors. The Securobot player must use his memory and powers of deduction to uncover which of the abandoned facility&rsquo;s many shadows conceal the nefarious Raiders.<br/><br/>The game play is very simple, but varies greatly with the number of players. The gaurds player has two guards under his control and may move them 1D6 each. If a guard managed to draw a line of sight to a shadow they can reveal it. If it contains a Raider then they are discovered and for them the game is up! The Raider players similarly have 2D6 which they get to use to move any shadow that they like. Could be the shadow with the Raider under, could be a bluff. If they make it to a vault with a Raider still undiscovered then they win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hired by various sages, historians and merchants, the players must enter a newly unearthed, ancient underground stronghold,in search of 13 Relics.  The Relics were broke apart and scattered through the dungeon's 5 chambers. Once inside, though no one can leave until all of the chambers are free of Relic Cards.  The Players will need to find the two parts of each Rlic to make a match, allowing them to utilize it's magic (+1 Combat for instance).  While exploring the Dungeon, the Players will come across a host of Monsters, trapped within the Dungeon with them.  They must also evade devious Traps, evade diabolical Shadow Magic, find secret doors, and hunt for helpful potions to help them along the way.  Will the Players help one another survive and escape, or will they attempt to match the most Relics?  They may have to do both.<br/><br/>Players will have two different colored dice that they will roll at the start of their turn.  One is for movement, the other, the Dungeon Dice, will determine whether a player will have to draw a card from the Dungeon Deck, based upon 2 numbers from 1 to 6 that each player must choose at the beginning of the game.  When one of the five chambers is emptied of it's contents, it will collapse, never to hold a card again.  Each time a collapse occurs, the players must add another chosen number, increasing their chance of drawing from the Dungeon Deck.  Once all chambers are free from Relic Cards, the exits will open allowing Players to leave.<br/><br/>Players can decide the ultimate victory for their play.  Simply escaping the dungeon, making the most matches, being the last one alive are all valid goals for which to strive.  A standard win however, is to escape the dungeon with the most matches.<br/><br/>",

The playing area is separated into squares, some with position names inscribed on them, some bearing the letter &quot;D&quot; (for decision card), and others blank. There is a space for the decision cards which are shuffled and placed face down in a pile. The ball is moved in accordance with dice rolls, with the aim being to maintain possession by ensuring that the ball lands on one of the dice roller's own position squares. If the ball lands on a &quot;D&quot; square play continues as per the instructions on the decision card at the top of the pile. If the ball lands on a blank square, possession goes to the other player. When playing from a position square both dice are rolled; when intercepting the ball from a blank square only a single die is used. The ultimate aim is to score goals (worth 6 points) and behinds (worth 1 point) by moving the ball through the appropriate posts at either end of the playing field.<br/><br/>",

Once movement has been performed it&rsquo;s time for any creatures of opposing wizards sharing a space to battle to the death, during the battle phase a creature can battle a wizard and if they win that wizard is eliminated and their part in the game is over. Once all the battles have been fought the wizards can summon a new creature to aid them in the conquest, if they happen to share a space matching their own element type they can summon two. Lastly new spells (creature counters) are collected and replenished, some are expired and returned to the counter pool ready for the next turn when each wizard left in the game must gather their thoughts and put their minds to their next strategy and prepare for the actions from the remaining wizards left in the game.<br/><br/>Each turn is broken down into steps which each wizard will perform before the next step begins. By placing their wizard and creatures in strategic positions the players can gain an important edge over their opponent that could be the difference between success and failure.

Players have 5 different game play styles to choose from and can play with different amounts of cards, in a half deck, full deck, or custom deck format. This is an &ldquo;E-Rated&rdquo; card game, sure to get your family involved, and easy enough for anyone to enjoy.<br/><br/>There are 10 decks to choose from: Ninja, Pirates, Aliens, Robots, Monsters, Undead, Ghosts, Vampires, Werewolves, and Zombies.<br/><br/>The game is designed to bridge the gap between games for really young children such as: &quot;Uno,&quot; &quot;Crazy 8's,&quot; and &quot;Old Maid,&quot;  and games for older children such as:  &quot;Magic the Gathering,&quot; &quot;Pokemon,&quot; etc.  It is designed to be an easy to pick up and play card game for children ages 6+, families, and casual players.  There are multiple ways to play the game, multiple decks to build, and players can even make up rules once they get comfortable with the gameplay. The trading card and custom deck options are just that...options, and are not required to play the game, unless you want to, and that is always welcomed!<br/><br/>War Fighters can be played by anyone, of any age, at any time, in multiple ways, without having to spend hours on rules getting confusing.<br/><br/>Basic Game Play (#1):<br/>-Divide one deck in half evenly and give each half to a player.<br/>-Each player will receive:  5 square fighters (Paper), 5 circle fighters (Rock), 5 ex fighters (Scissors), 4 attacks, 2 blocks, 2 truces, and 2 star leader fighter cards for a total of 25 cards in the basic version of the game.<br/>-Each player shuffles their half decks<br/>-Each player puts their decks to the left as their &quot;draw pile.&quot;<br/>-Each player draws 5 cards.<br/>-At the same time, each player plays a fighter card in the play area between them.  A fighter card will have a symbol of a circle, square, ex, or star on it.<br/>-To determine who wins, Square beats Circle, Circle beats Ex, Ex beats Square, Star beats all.<br/>-If both players play the same cards (ex:  circle vs. circle) then &quot;war&quot; is initiated and each player draws 3 cards from the draw pile and places it face down into the play area, and then plays another fighter card for the win. War continues until someone wins.  Each time the same cards are played, war is initiated again.<br/>-The winner of each round gets all the cards in the play area and puts them into their &quot;discard pile&quot; to their right.<br/>-When the cards in the play area are the same, players must draw the 3 cards and lay them face down followed by another fighter card.  However, when the cards are different (ex:  circle vs. square) a player can then decide if they want to use an &quot;attack&quot; card, &quot;block&quot; card, or a &quot;truce&quot; card.<br/>-An &quot;attack&quot; card is basically a &quot;+1&quot; or &quot;one up&quot; to the other player for the win.<br/>-A &quot;truce&quot; card means you do not want to fight anymore and want your card back, so both players get their cards back.<br/>-A player can choose to &quot;block&quot; an &quot;attack&quot; card as a defense to try and win the round.  A &quot;truce&quot; card cannot be blocked in the basic version of the game.<br/>-After each round, each player draws back up to 5 cards for the next round.<br/>-Each player can use their full hand in each round as needed, but can only use one fighter card during a round, unless  &quot;war&quot; has been initiated and the three face down cards need to be drawn.<br/>-It takes one attack and one circle to beat a square, one attack and one square to beat an ex, and one attack and an ex to beat a  circle card.<br/>-If a star card is thrown, it takes two unblocked attacks plus any fighter card (square, circle, ex) to beat the star card<br/>-The objective of the game, or how to win, is to collect all the leader cards from the other player.<br/>-On a 5 card hand, if a player does not have any fighter cards, they must show the other player their hand to prove they are not cheating, hand over one of their cards, shuffle all their cards, and draw a new 5 card hand.<br/>-During war, if a player does not have a fighter card to finish the round, that player must count the number of cards in their hand, shuffle all their cards, and draw another hand with that number of cards.<br/><br/>Game Play #2 - (War Strategies):<br/>-During this game style, players can choose to use attack, defense, and truce cards in order raise the stakes before going to war and/or to cancel out the war.  So, when players use the same cards (Ex:  circle vs. circle), the attack, block, and truce cards can now be played.<br/><br/>Game Play #3 - (Aggressive Vs. Defensive):<br/>-In this style of play, one person gets all the attack cards to start with, while the other gets all the blocks and truce cards.<br/>-As an additional rule, one of the players can get the &quot;power&quot; card as well.<br/>-The &quot;power&quot; card acts as 2 attack cards.  When used as an attack card, if a player wins the round, the other player's fighter card is taken out of the game until it is over, making the game go even faster.  Star Leader cards cannot be taken out of the game since they are needed in order to win the game.<br/><br/>Game Play #4 - (Power Cards):<br/>-In this mode, the loser of the previous round gets to use the power card to help &quot;even the odds.&quot;<br/>-One power card comes in each box.<br/><br/>Game Play #5 - (Custom Deck Options):<br/>-In this option, players can play half decks, full decks, or customs decks, and build their own decks to battle with.<br/>-Players can choose if the cards are deck specific as well.  For example, if one person uses ninjas and the other uses pirates, the you can assume that pirates do not know how to throw ninja attack darts or stricken, and therefore the cards are no good to pirates and only the ninja cards the player acquires can use those attacks.  This option is a bit advanced so most players who play this tend to put the other players fighter cards to the side and use the attacks, blocks, truce, and power cards in a non-deck specific mode.<br/><br/>Extra Game Information:<br/>-This game is very open so players who are comfortable with the rules tend to master it and then make up their own rules for added fun.<br/>-All decks play the same, but have different artwork to cater to everyones passions.<br/>-This game can also be used to play &quot;matching games,&quot; where you lay cards face down and try to pair them up.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There was an old Lady who swallowed a fly...  This trick-taking game is themed on the popular children&rsquo;s song. The object is to take tricks by playing the highest-ranked animal card. Problem is, when an animal card is played, its rank changes and usually for the worse.<br/><br/>Before each round, ranking cards are placed on the table in a row in order of rank:  fly, spider, bird, cat, dog, goat, cow, horse. The fly is the lowest ranked at the start, and the horse is the highest. The animal cards are shuffled and dealt. The start player plays a card, and the corresponding card in the rank row is shifted down one space. If an animal is already the lowest ranked animal, it is moved to the furthest space on the right and becomes the highest ranked animal.<br/><br/>Play proceeds clockwise. In turn, each player plays a card. A player must follow suit if possible, otherwise he may play any card.  Each played card causes the corresponding card in the rank row to shift down as described above.<br/><br/>After everyone has played, the player whose card matches the currently highest ranked animal wins the trick (regardless of suit). If two or more players have played the same &lsquo;winning&rsquo; card, the player who played first wins the trick.<br/><br/>This is a 3-4 player game. Partnership rules are included as well.<br/><br/>",

He/she can defend it or ally to it. To ally, he/she needs to play a card with the same numeric value, without taking into account the faction. The joint attack passes to the next player. This third player can ally or defend too. To defend, he/she needs to play cards from the opposite faction and with a higher number value than the attacking ones. After defending, each player can add more cards to the attack.  If the attack is defended properly the attacking and defending cards are discarded. If it is not, the defending player puts in his hand all attacking and defending cards. When the deck runs out, the first player who runs out of cards is the winner. Also, there are special cards which modify a little bit the game rules.<br/><br/>",

Under a share-the-wealth scheme it is proposed that the Government shall make every man a king and give each person an equal share of the money, after which time each must take care of himself. If a man has good luck and is a shrewd manager, he may beat the game of &quot;inflation.&quot; If he isn't, he will be no better off than theretofore and distribution of the wealth of the country will not have availed him anything&quot;.<br/><br/><br/>This game is played like modern Monopoly. From Wikipedia: &quot;Inflation board game came to the attention of Parker Brothers management in the 1930s, after they began sales of Monopoly. Copeland continued sales of the latter game after Parker Brothers attempted a patent lawsuit against him. Parker Brothers held the Magie and Darrow patents, but settled with Copeland rather than going to trial, since Copeland was prepared to have witnesses testify that they had played Monopoly before Darrow's &quot;invention&quot; of the game. The court settlement allowed Copeland to license Parker Brothers' patents&quot;.<br/><br/>",

If a huntsman moves on to the same straight line as the stag (providing there is no obstruction of wall or rock in between) the stag is counted as dead and is removed from the board. There are five stags to bag and the winner is the huntsman who bags the largest number of stags.<br/><br/>The huntsmen throw the dice in turn and move along the brown dots according to the number cast. They can only move from dot to dot along the straight lines. They cannot turn corners and they must move the exact number or not at all. If a huntsman moves on to the same straight line as the stag (providing there is no obstruction of a wall or rock in between) the stag is counted as dead and becomes their trophy.<br/><br/>The part of the stag is played by the two huntsmen in turn as follows: a huntsman moves his own piece first then if he wishes he can move the stag either one or two dots in a straight line.<br/><br/>Although the game is undated, Robert Ross &amp; Co were based in Southampton from 1945 to 1952.<br/><br/>",

It was superseded by In Harm's Way Tactics which incorporates many of the mechanics of HofI.<br/><br/>Heroes of the Imperium is a cooperative card/board game set in a science fantasy universe called the Imperium Chronicles. Up to five players work together as heroes on missions against the enemies of the Imperium (Solo play is also supported).<br/><br/>Each new game begins with players choosing from one of six hero archetypes: Assassin, Duelist, Grunt, Medic, Officer, and Psi Mage. Each hero is represented by a Stat card listing his attributes and default abilities/attacks. Each hero also has a deck of Ability cards from which the player can choose up to five. Some Ability cards are marked as &quot;Advanced&quot; and count as two cards. This allows players to choose fewer, but more powerful cards if they wish.<br/><br/>Once player have chosen their heroes and Ability cards, they select a mission to be played. Each mission description includes which enemies will be encountered and what goals the player must meet to win. An Encounter deck can also be used (especially for solo players) to randomize which enemies will be fought during the mission.<br/><br/>Each mission also includes a map of the game board. The board consists of several tiles that players assemble prior to the beginning of play. Paper miniatures, representing both heroes and enemies, are placed on the board and moved on a turn-by-turn basis. Each turn allows players to carry out several actions including attacking, movement, and using items. Control of the enemy side is either done by a single player who chose not to have a hero, or by hero players on a rotating basis.<br/><br/>Enemies in the game are grouped into three main factions: the primitive Ferans, slave-trading Ougluks, and the technologically advanced Warlock Industries. Each enemy, like the heroes, has a Stat card listing its attributes and default abilities/attacks. They do not, however, get additional Ability cards.<br/><br/>",

The player then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player two and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player Two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to Player One to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the Brainbox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins! For 1 player Look at the card as above for ten seconds. Then turn the card over and answer all the questions (use a pen and paper to record the answers). If all questions are answered correctly the card is kept. If any answers are incorrect, the card has to be put back in the Brainbox. See how many cards you have after five or ten minutes.<br/><br/>",

Meeples which pass space 17 are also eliminated. Each player has 4 meeples. The player of the last meeple to occupy the bock, gets the rest of the coins in the cash box and wins the game. Meeples which get thrown out by other meeples can be brought back into the game again, if they are not thrown out by other meeples of the same color. If a meeple has passed the bock it can be brought back to the starting Point, if it gets on Space 13 or 17 (or is thrown out by an opposing meeple).

There are 16 goods cards.<br/><br/>Players draw money cards from pile and use the money to buy goods offered for sale. The twist is that items, or a collection of items must be bought with the exact amount. So if a player makes a partial payment &quot;on account,&quot; then a following player can get the item by paying the exact balance due. On his turn a player may also aggregate items into a collection. The total cash in the game is exactly equal to the total value of all of the goods. The winner is the player with the highest value of goods when all goods have been bought.<br/><br/>",

Each player gets a bingo tablet which has the numbers 1-15. In the middle of the table, the chips come. There always three quizzes played. In the first round of quiz is about the four corner squares on the bingo tablet. Who could cover these fields with answer chip first, wins that round. The moderator asks a question from the question stack, the player who first gets &quot;BINGO&quot;, then may say the solution. If you are correct, he or she is allowed to occupy a corner with a chip, the answer is wrong, the player has to suspend for one round.  Once all questions have been asked a map, the next red card is drawn. Once all of the corner squared occupied, the winner gets 5 points credited, all the other players get as many pluses as they have covered chips. After the second game round begins. The chips from the first round, however, remain lying on the tablet. During the second round should you fill the middle of the first three rows of chips, also get all the players according to the number of chips on the tablet points in payroll. The winner will be credited 10 points this time. As the yellow question cards are taken. And here, the chips remain on the panel. In the third round, the game works gain similar to the previous one has here blue cards, the player must now cover all remaining fields with chips and the winner gets 20 points added to his or her account. Those who could collect the most points after all three rounds, may eventually challenge the Super Bingo round. If he or she wins the round, so doubled his/her score. Otherwise, they halved. We play with final game screen, which is a 5x5 large square with the number 1-25. Now the hourglass comes to train. The player has the task within 60 seconds to form a line of 5 fields with the chips either horizontally, vertically or diagonally. It is also worked here with the blue question cards. The player always calls the first field which he/she must prove with a chip, then reads the question before the host. If this answered correctly, a white chip is placed on the field, otherwise a black chip is placed. Now the player is called quickly to the next field on which he/she would place his/her stone.<br/><br/>The game ends after 60 seconds. The winner is the player who can have the most points after all four rounds.<br/><br/>",

First player to throw down three successive attacks or to push their opponent off the end of the strip score a touch. First to 5 or 15 wins the bout. The strategy recalls real fencing, but so does the speed, sometimes giving you no time for strategy.<br/><br/>",

With what little hope remains, we band together and make our Last Stand.<br/><br/>Last Stand is a cooperative survival simulation. Players will find themselves in a massive city with dwindling resources that is slowly being overrun with Infected. During the day, players can explore and take actions. They will have many opportunities to build bases, get supplies, assign survivors, fight and make use of special abilities. When Night falls, the Infected roam, but they are not the only threat.

This value indicates how many adjacent spaces you must control to claim that space. Take turns competing with your opponent to take spaces that allow new moves while also limiting your opponent's options.<br/><br/>Quot encourages players to anticipate their opponent's moves and develop a strategy to secure the largest area as possible.

Another example is the fire champion having preload damage type power cards(Preload is a type of card where you use currency to determine the time or damage a card will perform before its played) where as the imagination champion will be very location specific.  All that to say, skilled play will be vital to winning, not just having the best cards.<br/><br/>Awaken Destruction will give you all the tools you need to build a great deck to start and you compete to make them stronger. There are no additional packs to buy after the initial purchase unless a champion update comes out. Your starter deck will have the maximum number of each card your champion can have and then you can tailor it down to your style of game play. There is no random card pack selling going on in AD. If a champion update is released, you will know every single card in that update before you buy it.  We feel this method allows players to spend more time playing and less time spending.<br/><br/>You haven't played a card game like this before. I never played TCGs prior to designing AD. When I created this, I had no idea what was already out on the market or what had come before me.  I created a game I felt would be very fun to play,  a skill based game that rewards a players abilitiy to think and adapt changing strategies as they play.  You are not out of this game just because you are down at the moment.  Cards and luck can change in an instant. Its kind of an emotional rollercoaster at times.  Ive been down and out for what I thought was a no win senario and the independant enemies came in and rocked the other player and gave me that little window of hope that I was able to use to finish the match.  On the other hand, I been in games where I thought I had it in the bag and and I few heals from killing bonuses and the other player was right back in the game, so you never really know how it's gonna turn out.  Which is why having the ability to adapt different play styles mid-game is going to be what seperates the good players from the great ones.      <br/><br/><br/>",

These points (24 of them) are referred to as stations.  The two players have different colored pieces.  There are three sizes of game piece; each player has two statesmen (large,) four politicians (medium,) and six voters (small,) for a total of twelve, referred to as that player's phalanx.<br/><br/>The game begins with players taking turns placing any one of their pieces on any one station.  Like Mill, when a player is able to line up three of his pieces in a row, he is then entitled to remove one of his opponent's pieces, but in the case of this game, only voters may be removed in this fashion.  Unlike Mill, pieces in Politics may jump and capture each other as in Checkers, in any direction, once the initial placement phase is concluded.  A piece may only jump a like-sized or smaller piece.  To win, one must reduce the opponent to only two pieces, or to immobilize his remaining pieces.<br/><br/>",

You are a witch of the classic green skinned, pointy hatted variety, in competition with your weird sisters for that iconic status symbol: loads of warts!<br/><br/>Each card is an ingredient, and the cards interact based on their colors. As you add them to your cauldron, they have various effects, and when you have all four colors present, your potion goes POOF! If you had the right stuff in there, when the fumes clear out you'll be wartier than ever. All your sisters will be jealous.<br/><br/>But that's not all. In the heap of entrails and goop lie some of those most dreaded ingredients: healthy vegetables! Toss them into your opponents' cauldrons to spoil what would otherwise have been an absolutely disgusting brew, or, if you've got just the right color balance, you can use them to set your potion off with only minimal side effects!<br/><br/>Gameplay is three rounds. Each player gets 1 poof per round and may play 1 card per turn unless a card allows otherwise. When a player has poofed, their cauldron is reheating and is closed until the next round, so they may only play cards into other players' cauldrons until then. Cards may add or remove cards from cauldrons, cause players to draw or discard cards, give or take away warts, and plenty more specific gameplay-manipulating effects.<br/><br/>Number of players for one deck can be 2-6, although larger numbers of players can be supported by simply mixing in an additional deck.<br/><br/>",

Each player (one with black pieces, one with white) has eight pawns, four knights, two cannons, and one king.  Each piece is capable of capturing enemy pieces, and has a different method of movement.  The king piece cannot be captured, but can be put into check as in Chess.  A player's king must be moved to the central gold hex to win the game.<br/><br/>According to one account, the game's inventor lived in New Zealand.  The exact method for each piece's movement is currently unknown, though there is some mention of the cannon pieces moving somehow laterally.<br/><br/>This game is not to be confused with another Jaques game called Hexagony, which used hexes in a much different and smaller configuration, and with different pieces.<br/><br/>",

There are two built-in flaps on either side that can cover up one row each, making the board 8x8, or can be opened up, resulting in an 8x10 board.  Two lines through the board divide it into four quadrants.<br/><br/>Two players each have a variety of pieces in their own color.  For the basic 8x8 game, starting positions are very similar to Chess, but with differently named pieces, including Workers, Merchants/Banking, Labor/Transportation, Agriculture/Manufacturing, Capital, and Government.  Government is essentially the King piece, and to win the game, the opponent's Government piece must be &ldquo;cornered,&rdquo; that is, prevented from moving.  The movements and capturing for the game's pieces however do not correspond exactly to those of Chess, and in some cases are governed by the four quadrants of the board.  In the 8x10 game, extra Workers are placed on either side in the additional rows, as well as new Government Commission/Corporation pieces.<br/><br/>The game was meant to be manufactured with a cover that would rest on the flaps and the board's outer rim and seal it up with pieces inside for easy storage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grisleigh End<br/><br/>The Time: The 1930&rsquo;s, the Golden Age of Mystery<br/>The Place: Grisleigh End, ancestral seat of the Redmayne family.<br/>The Goal: To inherit the vast wealth of the Redmaynes by collecting fragments of shredded wills naming you heir.<br/>The Conflict: Opposition from other potential heirs, and the house called Grisleigh End.<br/>The Game: A boxed boardgame developed by the Council of Creators as the first in a suite of interconnected mystery-themed games set in and around this misty manor in the Welsh borderlands.<br/><br/>Lord Redmayne, Baron of Grisleigh End, has passed without a clear line of inheritance.  Having no children of his own issue, any claim to his rather sizable fortune must issue from his legal will.  Unfortunately the Baron not only wrote many different wills in the last years of his life, it seems he tore them all to shreds.  The six known claimants have been given twelve hours to prove their rights to inherit.  As one of these claimants, you must search the Baron&rsquo;s country manor to find fragments of the will which name you as heir.<br/><br/>Would that it were only that simple.<br/><br/>The other potential heirs are collecting their claims as well, and there&rsquo;s nothing to stop them from picking up your fragments to keep you from having them.  Some might even stoop so low as to steal claims you&rsquo;ve already gathered!  Keep in mind that opportunities also exist for collaboration, however, and that a winning strategy often includes working with your opponents when the time is right.<br/><br/>As if the competing heirs weren&rsquo;t enough to complicate your efforts, the End itself is an ode to the many peculiarities of the Redmayne family.  An ancient structure, expanded and updated haphazardly many times over the centuries, even the oldest members of the staff know only a portion of its secrets.  These individuals are key to your success, providing invaluable aid not merely in collecting your claims but also in successfully traversing the dangers of the house which may at times seem an implacable opponent.  For as you race from room to room, the house itself will interfere with your movement.<br/><br/>Grisleigh End is also a tribute to the mystery fiction and the authors who have entertained generations of readers.  The artwork references hundreds of golden age mystery novels and short stories, from The Abbey Grange by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle to The Zero Clue by Rex Stout, and dozens of mystery authors represented, from Margery Allingham to Israel Zangwill.<br/><br/>",

There is no die to determine the movement of the meeples. Instead each player gets 3 wooden disks. At each turn each player choses between 0 and 3 disks, which he hides in his closed hand. All players reveal their disks at the same time. Each player moves one of his meeples according to the sum of the number of his own disks and those of the player on his right side. If a meeple lands on a space with a red dot, it has to start again (There are a lot of red dots!). If it lands on a red cross, it is eliminated from the game. Landing on a green space means that the meeple has prematurely reached the finish line.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns drawing a card and asking one of the two questions of the player to their left.  If the player gets the question right, they keep the card, if they don't, the card goes back to the bottom of the deck.  The goal is to spell out &quot;CLEVERDICK&quot; before anyone else.  The only wrinkle is that there are also blank cards in the deck - no questions - and the player drawing one of these cards has to try and bluff the other player by making up a question.  If they pull it off, they keep the card and take one from the player, if not, the bluff-callin' player keeps the blank and take one from the asker.<br/><br/>Note: &quot;Cleverdick&quot; is actually mild slang in the UK, the equivalent of &quot;smarty pants&quot;, you're not actually calling someone a &quot;dick&quot;!<br/><br/>",

One deck is a regular deck of playing cards, and the other deck has from one to 3 numbers on them that range from zero (the Bupkis!) card up to 4 figures. Each number card has the four arithmetic operators (plus, minus, multiply and divide) on the bottom left with some or all of them in a darker font. The darker operators are the ones the player is allowed to use during the hand.<br/><br/>Each round the players are dealt 10 cards and randomly take a Number Card. The players must use the allowable operators on the Number Card to use all the Playing Cards in their hand to total the number or numbers on their card. The player who goes out receives the total of the cards left in the other player's hand as a score. The score is subtracted from the starting score of 500. The first player to reach 0 points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

If a meeple lands on a space of another color, it has to go back to the last free space of its own color. The same happens when a meeple is thrown out by another meeple. The first player who gets all 3 meeples on the the center spaces wins the game.<br/><br/>",

This is not obvious. Instead, it appears to be square due to the commonplace elongation of the diagonal dimension and/or shortening of the orthogonal dimension which is the universal convention for representing them.<br/>This implicates why a perfect mapping onto the surface of a 3-D sphere, from a circle rather than a square, is ideally suitable and achievable.]<br/><br/>Fortunately, the players are not required to deal with any complex, confusing 3-D curvature characteristic to a spherical playing surface.<br/><br/>This is the advantage to using flat 2-D representations of a spherical-surface, 3-D chess variant.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MicroSport Shuffle is a game of dexterity and skill based on popular British pub games dating back to the 15th Century.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player flicks four coins across a board marked with horizontal bands called beds. If a coin lands entirely within a bed (that is, without touching a horizontal line), he scores a point. Points are scored after each flick, so earlier coins may score multiple times, as long as they bumped into another bed. After his turn, the four coins are removed from the board and the game proceeds with the next player.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to score three points in each of the five beds. If a player lands a coin in a completed bed (where he already has three points), a point is awarded to his opponent instead. The winner is the first player to score fifteen points.<br/><br/>",

And neither village will be at peace until either the enemy's residents, or the other's rogue, is destroyed!<br/><br/><br/>    Includes 2 8-card decks (5 Peasants, 2 Guards, 1 Rogue per player.).<br/><br/><br/>The objective of this game is to expose the other player's Rogue card, or kill all of their Peasants, before they can do the same to you. Each turn, the players draw 3 cards and each choose 1 from the other player's hand before discarding and drawing another 3 cards. Should a Peasant be revealed, nothing happens. Should a Guard show his face, your opponent gets to reveal an additional card from your hand for that turn. Should the Rogue be revealed, you win. This was designed as a very quick, as well as easy to learn, mini-game.<br/><br/>One final mechanic worth mentioning: should a player have their Rogue card in hand and it is not revealed that turn, both decks and discard piles are reshuffled and their opponent removes one of their Peasants from their deck.<br/><br/>",

Choose wisely - you can never recruit two rounds in a row.<br/><br/>The Activation Phase is where most of a action takes place. Move and attack with any units you can with the hopes of slaying an enemy unit and receive it's bounty of 1 coin. Or, if the unit is already carrying a coin it's a race straight back to it's home square, where it can lock it down and finalise their role in the game.<br/><br/>The Purchase Phase simply lays down the opportunity to gain the upper hand via the purchase of an upgrade.

This means games will always be different since the strengths and weaknesses are randomized at the start of every game.<br/><br/>A winner is declared when all of the opponent's ships are destroyed. Different scenarios offer different win conditions, such as whoever earns the most victory points after 5 rounds or who can capture the mine first.<br/><br/>The game is also unique because of the pieces. The ships are hand-made out of wood in a tiny workshop in the USA., assembled by the one-man-team known as Alexander Shen. Because they&rsquo;re made of wood, they are also completely open to endless customization op-tions.<br/><br/>",

While the game is obviously suitable for children, some of the instructions to be followed seem equally suited to an adult drinking party. Landing on the famous statue of Lorelei, the player must sing a verse of &quot;Ich Weiss nicht, was joll es bedeuten&quot;, and if any player lands on the town of Oberwesel, everyone must immediately rise and belt out a verse from a Rhein song of their choice!<br/><br/>The First Edition is usually dated to c. 1910, while the Second Edition (with a painting of the town of Bacharach on the box cover) dates to c. 1924.<br/><br/>",

Unparalleled action And no dice.<br/><br/>Path of Bones uses dominoes - &quot;bones&quot; - instead of dice to run its combat system. Engagements run on a two-tiered system: troops mass and press their advantage together; heroes combine their marital arts styles into devastating attacks.<br/><br/>The rules provide an intriguing system of simultaneous attack and defense based on the two sides of the dominoes drawn by you and your opponent. Equipment and character types provide options for over forty different types of common troops. There are thousands and thousands of ways to combine the martial arts styles from the rules to make heroes ... and a guide to customizing the system to your own tastes.<br/><br/>With the base rules you get nine combat scenarios:<br/><br/>     One set allows a band of heroes to progress through a traditional Chinese story<br/>     Another sets the stage for fighting the Mongol Invasion of Japan<br/>     A set up for the epic climactic battle of the Forty Seven Ronin<br/>     Each combat scenario is playable as a stand-alone game, with options for replay value<br/>     Twenty-five pages of print-and-play terrain to support the scenarios right away<br/><br/><br/>The game plays well from as few as forty to fifty figures total (both sides) up to about five hundred. It was playtested with 25-28mm figures using standard size dominoes and 15-28mm figures using mini dominoes. Bones are used to measure movement as well as resolve combat.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to travel from the starting spacees (1-4) to the summer vacation spots (A-D). The 1st player to get all 4 meeples to his vacation spot, wins the game.<br/><br/>Each spinning of the roulette wheel determines the moves of all 4 players (A-D) at once. For the different kind of meeples, there are different rules of how and when they move and what happens, when the meet each other. So for example, the woman can carry a man of any color (this symbolizes them forming a pair) and the letter causes man and woman to step a few spaces back, while they are busy with reading. Some encounters even cause the meeples to get sent back to their home to start anew.<br/><br/>This game most likely was published in the 1930s.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pleiades, an early adaptation of dominoes to triangular pieces, was granted a patent in 1879.  The game consists of a central six-pointed star piece, each point being marked on both outer edges with a number of dots from one to six, and thirty-six triangular tiles marked along their edges with numbers ranging from one to six.<br/><br/>To begin the game, the tiles are placed face down and shuffled, and two or more players draw an agreed upon number.  The player who has drawn a tile with three sixes goes first, matching a tile to one of the central star's numbered edges.  The players then take turns matching their tiles to the original in order to create a hexagon shaped star adjoining the central piece.  If no match is possible, a player must pass.  The player who completes the hexagonal star gets one point, and the next player begins another star by matching a tile to the central star.  If no player can match a piece, that star is blocked and play begins on another.  The player scoring the most points (there are a maximum of six) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players are walked through the last moments before the bay doors open, connecting to the mainframe computer and assigning the positions of your R.A.T.s (Recon Attack Team). A high-tech feel is produced through bullet holes, digital accents and blue metal artwork, both across the game board and cards.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:<br/>Players take turns moving their team (consisting of one Champion and four R.A.T.s) to the center of the board. R.A.T.s are divided into melee and ranged fighters, each with unique and limited moving patterns and attack abilities. Your Champion may move one space in any direction and is the only character who can complete the game by grabbing the Standard.<br/><br/>R.A.T.s engage and run interference while your Champion navigates the battlefield. Power cards and specialty cards provide unique abilities, buffs, advantages and pitfalls which can enhance your ability to harm or hinder opponents.

If the player is unsatisfied with their dice roll, they may remove one of their dice in order to reroll all of the remaining dice and trap a higher number of slimes for the turn. Gameplay and turns continue this way until the Slime deck is completely gone through twice, then the players reference the Score Reference Card to figure up their scores and determine the winner.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/><br/>Each Slime is worth 1 point on its own, but additional points bonuses are awarded when certain criteria are met, such as collecting 1 of each color or the most of a specific color.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chanakya's Chakkravyuh is a unique learning tool in the form of a financial board game. Its main purpose is to help players from all walks of life (including common man, entrepreneurs, corporate professionals, students, educators, home makers, investors) attain financial literacy. Minimum age is 15 years and above.<br/><br/>Inspired by the 2000-year old wisdom of prominent Indian economist Chanakya, this game enlightens individuals on how to manage money and connect financial knowledge to resourceful opportunities, which are ever-present in today's changing world.<br/><br/>The player initially chooses a dream out of various dreams listed on the board. Each dream has a purchase price listed on it. In order to win the game, the player must purchase his/her pre-selected dream.<br/><br/>There are two parts in the game, the first is Chakkravyuh and second is Rajmarg. All players start inside the Chakkravyuh. In the first part of the game, a player may not have enough money to buy his/her dream. Chanakya's Chakkravyuh simulates real-life investment opportunities, various market scenarios, and unforeseen life situations to throw challenges that the participants have to tackle. By successfully navigating these challenges and deriving &quot;passive income&quot; (income where each rupee works to bring you even more rupees), participants eventually build enough income generating assets to move into the second part of the game, i.e. the Rajmarg. It is in the Rajmarg that the player can acquire their pre-selected &quot;dream&quot;.<br/><br/>Even though there is no official time limit, the entire game normally lasts about 4 hours. The first player to purchase his/her dream wins the game, and that is officially the end of the game.<br/><br/>The experiential nature of a game-based environment makes the process of learning a lot more fun, and there is also a sense of competition among the participants.<br/><br/>Besides gaining financial knowledge and learning how to leverage passive income, participants will understand the real difference between an asset and a liability. Additionally, important lessons will be learned in basic accounting principles, debt financing, interpersonal communication, negotiations and joint deal-making.<br/><br/>No background in business or finance is required. Absolutely anyone can play this game.<br/><br/>",

They are meant to be carry-on or gifts, suitable for children (&quot;Mitbringspiel&quot;). Some of the cubes contain actual games, others contain magic tricks, puzzles etc.<br/><br/>20 pieces of cloth are placed in the middle of the table. Each player has a clothes line.<br/><br/>On your turn you must throw a die and you get a cloth in the corresponding color, which you hang on your clothes line. If no cloths of that color are left then you receive nothing.<br/><br/>If you throw a sun you must take a sunbeam and place it aside (there are 6). If the sun in the die is shining you can chose any cloth from the middle, but if its unhappy you must return one of yours to the middle (or one of an opponent if you don&rsquo;t have any left).<br/><br/>The game ends when the sixth sunbeam is taken. The player with more cloth on his clothes line wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You and your fellow explorers have discovered the underground city of Agartha!...and its fabulous gems!  Unfortunately, removing the gems has disrupted the integrity of the area, and now the whole city threatens to collapse around you!  Your only hope is to work your way through the city and figure out which gems act as the keys to stop the collapse.<br/><br/>But be careful!  The more you move throughout the city, the faster it weakens, and the sooner it will collapse...<br/><br/>...and if that wasn't enough!  The gems are all cursed!  If the you're skilled enough to survive, be sure you have the least cursed gems...or else the consequences will be swift and painful!!!<br/><br/><br/>Players use deductive reasoning to establish which gems were removed from play at the beginning of the game.  This is accomplished by strategically moving along a play area composed of tiles that the players may rotate, push, and move between.  Rotating and pushing tiles speeds up the end of the game, so it's best to be judicious in how often you do so.<br/><br/>A cooperative game, if the hidden gems are not identified by game's end, then there is no winner.  However, if the group does solve the mystery, then the player in possession of the least cursed gems is victorious!<br/><br/>",

You win if you are the first player to have no tiles remaining. With more than 2 players, continue playing to determine runner-ups.<br/><br/>The unique beauty of Aatheuo comes from the spatial-reasoning involved in re-arranging the board in any way, as long as all of the basic properties of the sequences and sets are maintained.<br/><br/>Aatheuo was chosen as an Official Selection in IndieCade 2012, in addition to being featured as a night game at IndieCade. There are no concrete plans for bulk physical manufacturing of Aatheuo sets, but a digital version is in pre-production.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Paddington Photo is a roll and move game with a twist. The game is a small box game. It consists of a 3-piece (puzzle type) game board, 3 cardboard figures (Paddington, Mr. and Mrs. Brown) and 25 plastic chips as well as 2 colour dice. The game board has spots in red, blue yellow etc. round in a circle. In game variation one all 3 figures are placed randomly on the board. On his turn a player rolls both dice. He/she assigns each roll to a figure on the board and moves two figures according to the die roll. E.g. the dice show red and yellow: then the player must move 2 of the three figures. One on any red space, one on any yellow space. When the three figures are located next to each other a photo is shot. The player achieving the photo shot gets a chip as reward. Once a photo is completed the middle figure runs away to the opposite space of the same colour. After 20 photos are shot the game ends, player with the most chips wins. In a variation a photo is especially well taken when Paddington is in the middle. Then the player gets 2 chips for this kind of photo shot. After all 25 chips are exhausted the game ends.<br/><br/>",

It takes place directly after Dawn &ndash; Rise of the Occulites and has you representing an Occulite Tribe that didn&rsquo;t quite collect enough Sungems for the Long Dark. You do not need to have played Dawn previously or be aware of the Rise of the Occulites setting, but knowing the setting obviously helps with understanding the theme of the game.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the only Tribe that is undiscovered at the end of a Round. The player with the most wins after three Rounds wins. Draws go to the player who has the most Sungems in total after those three rounds.<br/><br/>On average games/rounds take 10-15 minutes depending on the number of players. Games of Sungem Run! are tense and exciting as you try and find out who the other player&rsquo;s Tribe is and then how to expose them without exposing yourself. A game of sneakiness, misdirection and deduction, Sungem Run! is a blast to play!<br/><br/>",

Each character has his or her own Specialties that give them advantages over the other players.<br/><br/>Players explore the dark corridors of an infested office building, represented by a 72-card Encounter Deck in the middle of the playing area. The Encounter Deck is separated into four stacks known as Corridors. Players take turns moving through the Corridors, flipping cards and facing the challenges that are revealed. They can fall into Holes or be struck by Debris. They can rescue Bystanders, with welcome benefits. They'll find Perks, special items that help them throughout the game. But they'll also encounter the deadly monsters known as Ghouls, giant, green creatures of destruction that can be defeated only by the mysterious substance known as Ghoo. The stronger the Ghoul, the more Victory Points are earned by its defeat. First person to 10 Victory Points wins the game!<br/><br/>",

The pew-pew die is marked on each side with one or two triangular symbols denoting attack and defense capabilities.<br/><br/>Each players starts with the pew-pew die in his or her hand and mixes it around in their palm before starting. Facing one another, the players open their hands revealing the die faces. Each player can then twist their die up to 90-degrees either clockwise or counter-clockwise to orient the faces into a desired attack and defense configuration.  The players then determine the result of the initial round based on the attack, defense and orientation of the pew-pew die and then make moves from this initial position to conclude the game.<br/><br/>For each round thereafter a player's die can only be changed in the following ways:<br/><br/>1) A die can be rotated 90-degrees clockwise or counter-clockwise only after flipping<br/><br/>2) A pew-pew die can be flipped onto its front (the side closest the opponent), left or right sides<br/><br/>Play proceeds for as many rounds as the players desire, up to a pre-determined number of wins -- typically three works best.<br/><br/>This game is inspired by the dice jousting mechanism used by Bushi Shogi.<br/><br/>",

In addtion, if you think the other player is bluffing, you can call out &quot; You Liar&quot;. All the other player must then decide to either think the call is correct or not.<br/><br/>The losing team will take negative points. When a player reach a certain number of points, the game ends. That player loses and the rest win the game.<br/><br/>The game will be themed in the same world as the game Gold Rush.<br/><br/>",

The game is played on an 11x11 checkerboard, though the published edition's board uses circles for the active squares, leaves out the unused squares, and has lines connecting the circles diagonally to show where pieces may move.<br/><br/>Each player has twelve stackable checkers of their own color, and begins the game by placing them on the five outer circles of each side of the board, with four pieces centered on the next inner row, and three centered on the row after that, leaving twelve open circles in the center of the board.<br/><br/>The rules are the same for ordinary Checkers, including movement, capture, promoting pieces by reaching the furthest row on the other side of the board, and compulsory capture.  To this, Super-Chex adds the ability of pieces to move vertically along the outer rows of the board, essentially a double move, so long as the outermost circles are vacant.<br/><br/>The last player with pieces on the board wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Tracks contains two types of spaces : straight section, or curve. The average length of a lap is between 40 spaces (fast tracks) and 60 spaces (long tracks). For the moment, there are 9 tracks : Monaco, Canada, Belgium, Japan, Italy, Catalunya, Singapore, China, Le mans.<br/><br/>Grand-prix Elite uses plastic racing cars (dimension = 27 mm long).<br/>Six-sided dice are used for Wear tests, Skid tests, etc...<br/>Optional rules include weather variation and Event cards.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY : each player has a certain number of Speed cards. In order to move his car he plays 1 Speed card. <br/>Then the Speed card goes to his dashboard : this is now the current speed of the car. <br/>Each turn, the player can increase or decrease this speed by 1 level. <br/>Also, extra movements are given by a Tyre-Setup card located in the dashboard. The Tyre-Setup card represents the strategy chosen for the car (soft, hard or rain tyres, aero grip, suspension, etc..)<br/>Once moved, a car can engage another car in order to gain its position.<br/><br/>Each player faces 3 challenges in this game :<br/>a) Damages. The number of Speed cards owned by the player is also the number of damages his car can absorb without consequences. Powerful Speed cards often leads to damages (due to engine wear or dangerous curve)...Some cars are fast but fragiles, so pit stops will be necessary in this case.<br/>b) Curves. Each curve has an optimal speed. If a car's speed exceeds the optimal speed while taking the curve, the car can goes off track (and possibly taking damages). <br/>However, a driver has 3 choices when his car is about to take a curve : short, medium, or long trajectory. With a short trajectory, you go faster, but it's risky. With a long trajectory, you take the curve more easily, but you become an easy prey if engaged by opponents...<br/>Here, tyre and set-up strategies are very important things for purpose of taking a curve.<br/>c) Ghost cars. In addition to his normal car, each player controls one or several Ghost cars. Ghost cars follow their own rules, and symbolize the bulk of lapped cars driven by anonymous drivers. Their purpose is to annoy other players.<br/><br/>",

The board is comprised of 133 dots connected by lines, with 11 dots on each corner and 45 in the center of the board.  The eight star points are in four colors, each color matching the star point on the opposite side of the board.  The players' pieces begin on a star point of the same color, and the objective is to be the first to move all of a player's pieces to the opposite star point and win the game.<br/><br/>Rules for movement are the same as for Halma and Chinese Checkers, meaning that players take turns moving one piece at a time in any direction, and that players may jump their own or other players' pieces.  Pieces are not removed from the board.  The pieces must move only along the lines connecting the dots on the board however, and Ching Gong for Four's board is unusual in this regard.  Not only does it have eight points or corners instead of four or six, but not every dot is connected to the other.  Half the dots are connected to eight surround dots, the other half only four surrounding dots.<br/><br/>This game is not to be confused with another game from the same publisher, Ching Gong for Two, which is played on a standard Chinese Checkers board and has three colors of pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The board represents a spider's web. The spider's den is in the center. 19 pieces are used: one spider, 13 common(yellow) flies and five blue(green) flies. Blue flies count three and common flies are one for a total of 28 points. One team is the flies the other team is the spider. Object of game is to score 15 points. Flies attempt to get into spider's den and score according to their values. Spider seeks to consume flies and keep them out of his den.<br/><br/>Moves are somewhat like checkers. Spider jumps the flies and removes them from the board. Flies do not jump. Common flies may only move forward or around the circle. Blue flies may move backwards as well.<br/><br/>Flies start first. The spider may move in a straight line on any of the lines running toward the center as far as he please. He cannot pass over the double circle either going out or coming in without stopping there one move. On all the circles except the double one the spider cannot move any further than the flies can (one space). On the double circle the spider may move 1/4 of the way around at one move. The spider may jump in any direction as many times as his moves entitle him to. He is requited to stop at the next crossing beyond each fly jumped. If several flies are in position with but one crossing between each fly he must jump all such flies (no matter what direction it takes him) stopping at the next crossing beyond the last fly.<br/><br/>The spider may jump from his den and take any fly on the double circle unless there is another fly in front of or behind it. It also enables him when on the double circle to take a fly standing on the crossing 1/4 the way around if there is no fly on the next crossing beyond and none between. The spider may move clear across the double circle passing through the center on his way and jump a fly on the opposite side of the double circle if there are no intervening flies and none beyond the fly to back him up. The spider may move from the double circle to the outside circle in one move (nothing intervening) but cannot return to the center when outside the double circle without stopping one move on the way at the double circle.<br/><br/>",

When they land their piece on a color that matches their pieces, they can make another attempt to flick a wink into a cup.  If they manage to get their piece to the end of the trail, they place one of their winks into the cup at the end of their trail and take their piece back.<br/><br/>The cups at the end of the trails are worth 25 points each, while the one that can only be reached by the tiddlywinks is worth 50 points.

On Map 9x9 there will be cities to attack and either plunder them or conquer to gain resources bringing players closer to victory.<br/><br/>On their turn each player will throw dice depending on their logistic power to bring more troops, send them for quest, prepare the attack, build forts or sending spies to see the defense on city they wish to attack.<br/><br/>",

The black ant player sends workers out to find breadcrumbs and twigs and return them to the anthill, and sends soldiers out to protect the workers. The red and player has a small number of ants who invade the area and try to capture the workers.<br/><br/>The black ant player does not know where the breadcrumbs and twigs are, as they are among a bunch of pieces randomly placed face-down on the board at the start of the game. Other pieces are impassable obstacles and an antlion which immediately kills the ant finding it.<br/><br/>There is also a solitaire scenario in which the player controls the black ants and has to get a certain number of breadcrumbs back to the hill. Making this difficult is Eglantine the praying mantis, who moves around the board randomly and kills any ant it gets near.<br/><br/>",

Pieces may move in any direction.  Cattle pieces move to an open adjacent circle or by jumping a friendly or opponent piece to a vacant circle on the other side.  Cowboys move this way, but also may jump over any number of pieces in a row to reach a vacant circle on the opposite side.  Pieces are not removed from the board.<br/><br/>The first player to move all of his pieces to the opposite side and match the piece numbers to the board numbers wins the game.

The patients on the ward are dreaming of the traumatosaures, creatures from another dimension, who appear in the hospital and try to absorb the patients so they can return home.<br/><br/>The game takes place in hourly turns over the course of one night. One player takes the role of the nursing staff, who move around getting treatments (pills, injections, and electroshock devices), administering treatments, waking up sleeping patients, and moving patients from room to room. However, they do not have free choice when moving the nurses; for each one a die is rolled, giving two possible rooms they can go to.<br/><br/>The traumatosaure player moves the traumatosaures that have appeared in the hospital (because the matching patients fell asleep) and moves them, also using die rolls, which now determine how far to move (half speed if the patient is now awake). The traumatosaure player also has a certain number of &quot;AARRGGHH&quot; tokens which can be used on patients to make it harder to help them.<br/><br/>The advanced game adds fixed events which take place each turn.<br/><br/>",

The Socker then holds a rubber cup in one hand and rolls a pair of six-sided dice.<br/><br/>Whenever the Socker rolls a seven or eleven (SOCK-O!) he must then slap the cup down and try to catch one or more of the balls in the ring.  If he catches someone, they must give him a chip.  If he fails to catch someone, he must give them a chip.  Players who pull away prematurely are penalized a chip.  If the Socker mistakenly slaps the cup down, he is penalized a chip for every player whose piece is still in the ring.<br/><br/>The Socker continues rolling the dice until he has had three SOCK-O's, at which point he trades with the player to his left and play continues with the new Socker.  The player with the most chips when the game ends (by default or agreement) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each of these additional cells is called a Fortress and belongs to a player.<br/><br/>Each player has three kinds of pieces in their own color: one General, four Officers, and seven Soldiers.  To begin the game, the General pieces are placed in the middle triangle of the first row adjoining that player's Fortress.  Filling out that row are the four Officers.  The next row inward has seven triangles and each are occupied by Soldiers.  These two rows are known as each player's Zone.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to move a General into an opponent's Fortress.  A cell may be occupied by only one piece at a time; players capture each other's pieces by landing on the same cell and removing the opponent's piece from the board.  Capture is not compulsory, and continuing moves after a capture is not permitted.  Movement of the pieces is through the sides of the triangular cells, not the points.<br/><br/>A Soldier moves to one adjacent cell in any direction except backwards towards his home Fortress.  An Officer moves across two adjacent cells, unless there is a piece he wishes to capture in one adjacent cell.  After capturing, he must remain in that cell until the next turn.  While in their own Zone, Officers may not move back towards their own Fortress.  Once out of their Zone, Officers may move in any direction.  Generals move across one or two adjacent cells in any combination of directions, so long as they do not return to the same cell on the same turn.<br/><br/>The first player to move his General into an opponent's Fortress wins the game.  Since it is possible for any piece to capture any other piece, it is possible that all three Generals could be captured and no player would win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kastellet is a game for two, played on a hexagonal board comprised of sixty-one smaller hexagons, five to each side.  The central hex is referred to as the Point, and may not be played upon by either participant.  There is a unique neutral piece called the &ldquo;Roy&rdquo; which is used to mark the Point.  Each player has thirteen pieces in their own color, as follows: five Flag pieces, four Maces, three Lances, and one Bar.  Only one piece may be on a hex at a time; landing on an occupied hex is a capture, and the opponent's piece is removed from the game.  The object of the game is to continually &ldquo;cover&rdquo; the Point by always having at least one piece ready to move onto it.  Should a player lose his pieces covering the Point and not be able to move another piece into covering position on the next turn, he loses the game.<br/><br/>The game begins with the players at opposite ends of the board, with a five hexagon side closest to them.  Their five Flags are placed on those closest five hexes, the player's back line.  Flags only move forward to one adjacent hex, toward the opponent's end of the board.  Should a Flag reach the center hex of the opponent's back line, on the next turn (if it has not since been captured) it can be exchanged for that player's Bar piece, which is held in reserve at the start of the game.  The Bar can be placed anywhere on the board, but will remain there for the rest of the game, unable to be moved or captured by either player.  No further moves are allowed for that turn.<br/><br/>Maces begin the game two to a side on both ends of the players' Flags, extending around the rim of the board.  Maces may move to any adjacent hex, in any direction.<br/><br/>Lances begin in the central three hexes of the third row of hexes inward from the players' back lines.  The movement of a Lance is through the points and lines of the adjacent hexes to one of up to six hexes just beyond.  The game's hexes may have three alternating colors so that the color-bound moves of the Lances are obvious.  Because of its position on the board and its style of movement, the central of the three Lances begins the game covering the Roy.<br/><br/>",

There are three long sides of the board, equivalent to six of the cell's sides in length, and three short sides, two cells in length.  The overall shape is of a triangle with it's points cut off, and the game's pieces (Stones) share this shape.  Half of the board's cells are recessed, and divided into three color groups: black for a triangular Field in the center of the board, and red, yellow, and green for each of the Camps in the corners of the board.  In each of the recessed Camp cells are a number of dots in one of these quantities: one, three, six, ten, and fifteen, with the smaller quantities being closer to the center of the board.<br/><br/>Each player starts play with nine Stones of the same color as his Camp, placed in all the cells of his Camp.  The game is played only in the recessed cells of the board.  Players take turns moving their Stones one at a time in an attempt to move all the stones of their color into one or both of their opponents' Camps.  Stones may move to any one vacant adjacent cell (there are up to six adjacent recessed areas) per turn, so long as they do not re-enter their own Camp.  Stones may jump over one opponent's piece to an empty adjacent cell on the opposite side; stones are not removed from the board.  Jumps over friendly Stones are not allowed.<br/><br/>The rules allow for final scores to be tallied based on the number of dots covered by each player in their opponent's Camps, and for alternate winning conditions.<br/><br/>",

World isn't in ruins (it's not a full post apocalypse but pretty messed up) but in a very bad state. Some terytories are in better shape, a rich ones of course live in a good cities with clean air water and ecologically clean food, poor people aren't so lucky they have to deal with desease, poor salaries raiders etc. Political map changed dramaticly some contries disappeared a new one emerged. The name of the game has a relation to the actual document of WWII between Germany and USSR the original text in ussr was kept in the special folder under number 34. The realtion is spiritual of course, it can give the mood of the uncertanty there is peace for now but for how long and at the same time war is continuing but on the different fronts in trade in politics and in actual &quot;undercarpet&quot; secret  combat by mercenary pmc.<br/><br/>A few words about gameplay:<br/><br/>Players control a group of mercenaries,who  is trying to survive in the world.After choosing a spawn region  players start roam the world map in turn base manner, trading, finding themselves in different random events,building their base and of course taking missions . Countries autonomously  act with each other,influencing the market  and  political situation(some political events can create a job oportunity with bigger challenge  and at the same time with bigger profits and reputation points). As for missions-There are many types of them they are played on a smaller maps with terrain also in the turn based manner(One of the things that we want to make is a very tactical game play where diceroll isn't a decisive thing but human skill is). All in all the game has more  of  rouge like feel  than a  classical wargame with particular objectives.  The process is the main fun part,but global goals also here(Player can get a citizenship of particular country and lead it to world  domination,take hold of the entire PMC market and be the one who pull the strings,also there are  some endings that are closely lore related).Also battle system can be used just for skirmishes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For almost three hundred years no Coldrum set foot in Mossdown, a largely self-imposed exile recently ended by my acquisition of the ruins of our ancestral home. With the restoration of Coldrum Manor ongoing, there has never been a better time to document its history, and it seems apt that it should be a Coldrum to relate the tale.<br/><br/>Coldrum Manor, more commonly known as the derisory &ldquo;Redcap Manor&rdquo;, was built atop Mossdown Hill, a site long associated with spirits and faeries. Legend speaks of a series of standing stones that once stood near the hill, and Roman records of the area describe pagan rites involving human sacrifice. The strategic location of Mossdown Hill has long been recognised, and several strongholds have been constructed at this site over the last one thousand years.<br/><br/>'Redcap Manor' draws from the most traditional tales of haunting in the British Isles, in which it was faeries, not ghosts, that kept people awake at night. In 'Redcap Manor', each player represents one of four Edwardian investigators sent to the titular mansion, to gather as much evidence for the uncanny as they can over three nights. To this end, the protagonists will use the recently-harnessed power of electromagnetism against the Fae.<br/><br/>'Redcap Manor' is an auction/bluffing card game, divided into three turns representing the three nights of terror. Each turn, the players select a number of Haunt cards from their hand, to be secretly shuffled into the Haunt deck for the next night. Haunt cards are divided into three types: Fae, Presence, and Influence cards, each of which is countered by a different Ward card. Each player then places one of their three Ward cards face-down, and takes it in turns to uncover the top-most Haunt card. Eight cards are revealed per turn, representing eight hours before the dawn. After revealing a Haunt card, a player may choose to flee the Manor, but may not re-enter that night. The Haunt card remains face-up, and may be taken by subsequent players, together with any newly revealed cards. Alternatively, the player may take the Haunt card(s) - any Haunt cards countered by their Ward are taken as evidence (victory points); however, if the top-most card is not countered by their Ward, it is taken as a curse. Each Haunt card (24 unique cards, one for each hour of each night) has its own effect, influencing how the game is played. The player must determine whether taking a curse is worth the opportunity to acquire more evidence.<br/><br/>At the end of the third night, the player with the most evidence points is the victor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What do you get when you mix Chaos, Cribbage, and Carnage?<br/><br/>War Elephant Racing (W.E.R.) is a fast paced game of chance and skill. War elephants will be bumping and crashing into each other on a tight course sending the others into a spin that will cost them crucial game points. Players must carefully balance a number of objectives, be quick with reactions, and recognize all of the scoring combinations to be able to beat their opponent. It is a game where experience counts for a great deal although a little bit of luck always helps. New and young players will be able to jump in fairly quickly and give the vets a run for their money.<br/><br/>War Elephant Racing uses Xhaos cards to spice up the race and increase the competitive action. Xhaos cards are special cards that call upon a special ability of an elephant of renown to give the players huge advantages to use against their competition. Special timing will provide the players with an edge over the other war elephant racers.<br/><br/>War Elephant Racing is played closely to Cribbage, each player is dealt war elephant racing cards and then must take turns laying one card at a time from their hand to attempt to get pairs, runs, and target numbers to score points. Each point allows the player to move their elephant an equal amount of points. Once each player has played all of the cards from their hand they then take turns adding up the different combinations of &quot;points&quot; in their hand to move their elephants. Players move around the tight track for six laps.<br/><br/>While players are moving their elephants if they land in a space that has another elephant they &quot;bump&quot; them. When a bump occurs the bump dice are rolled allowing the elephant to pass through, or send the bumped elephant in a spin, or send themselves in a spin costing valuable points.<br/><br/>War Elephant Racing also has &quot;Xhaos&quot; cards which allow them to make ranged attacks, powerful bumps, throw spectators in the path, and more. The xhaos cards are a great fun edge that each player will have to help them win the race. Almost all of the xhaos cards are named after famous elephants in history, and their effect in the game is related to their fame.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An adult card game that will have you laughing all night. You will be amazed about what you will find out about your friends.<br/><br/>It's a simple and fun adult card game that is different every time you play, as different groups will respond in different ways. You will find out more about your friends or new people at a party. You will be amazed and surprised about the answers you get to intimate, probing questions. We are sure you will be surprised about what you learn about your friends.<br/><br/>In its simplistic form, a dealer reads a question from the deck and you anonymously answer 'Yes' or 'No'. The dealer tries to guess how many answered 'Yes' or 'No', and if they guess correctly, they keep the question card. If not the dealer decides which stories they want to hear why people answered 'Yes' or 'No'. If the dealer wants to hear the 'Yes' stories and you as a player answered yes, you can choose to tell the story to win the card, or keep quiet and remain anonymous. If there are more than one 'Yes' cards, then multiple people can tell their stories and the dealer decides which story wins. At the end of the game, the player who has gathered the most cards wins the game.<br/><br/>The great thing about this game is that you have the freedom to choose to remain anonymous or to share the stories behind your answer - so you decide on what to divulge to the group you&rsquo;re playing with, it allows you to freely express something in public without the repercussions.<br/><br/>The game provides the environment to share stories and situations and engage in conversations that you would not normally engage in. You will be amazed what you find out about your friends. Is an adult game(18+), so as you can imagine there are some pretty risque questions.<br/><br/>Here are a couple of 'tame' sample questions in the deck:<br/><br/>Have you ever had a DUI?<br/>Have you ever been arrested?<br/>Have you ever lied on a tax return?<br/><br/>",

Your tank, marked by a unique color, carries a special payload that must be fired from &quot;The Zone&quot; to disable the enemies communications base. Reach The Zone with your commander, and you win. Capture the enemy commander, and you win.<br/><br/>So how do you do it? To reach The Zone, you must navigate the terrain and capture or circumvent enemy tanks. To capture a tank, move your tank into the space it occupies.<br/><br/>Each space on the board features one of four types of terrain, either dirt, grass, hill, or mud. Each space gives you a different combination of attack and movement range when you move from that space. You can get stuck in the mud with a movement of zero, or blast down a hill with a movement of 2! Your attack range is consistently 1, except for when you have the high vantage point of the hill space.<br/><br/>This has the feel of a classic strategy game like Othello or Stratego. It's very simple to learn but hard to master. Understanding the terrain and effectively positioning your forces will be the key to your success. Pretty simple, right? Then get moving, Commander!<br/><br/>",

This is done by moving round the board, drawing cards and sometimes having to answer questions related to different countries. The card also has an amount on it in the thousands which is then converted to Rands using the exchange rate of the land you just moved onto. There is also then a multiplier done based on the colour of the square you landed on. There are also Action and Bonus squares giving you a 2 &amp; 3 times bounces. You keep doing this and the first person to 1 million Rand wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MazeScrolls are a series of maze puzzles games in the form of scrolls. They are a new kind of game genre: the pen and paper maze puzzle dice games for multiple players.<br/><br/>There are 8 different MazeScroll designs and each one uses different graphics and offers different game-play. The eight MazeScrolls are the following:<br/><br/>- Galaxy Far, Faar, Faaar Away<br/>- Perimeter Perplexity<br/>- De Stijl Mile<br/>- Daedalus Treasure<br/>- Lovers Duel<br/>- Daedalus Palace<br/>- Crossing<br/>- Skritches, Skretches and Skrutches<br/><br/>MazeScrolls are a game of meandering journey that can be played by a single player or multiple players. Players can race from one end to the opposite end or they can start at opposite ends and attempt to find each other. Players can also &quot;duel&quot; by first collecting power points so that when they meet-up the one with the most power wins.<br/><br/>Players play the MazeScroll games using a pen, pencil or colored pencils. When the game is done, the finished MazeScroll becomes a piece of artwork that is also a record of their play.<br/><br/>",

Once you get a run you put it down, but to keep it in play, you have to answer a question related to the birds in the run. You could skip this part for younger players. With the questions, it makes it an educational game. It is easy to teach and learn. There are also joker cards counting as any card. You score points for the amount of runs you have down. You also score negative points for the cards in your hand once the game ends. The worst card to end up with in your hand is a joker, losing you 50 points. The winner is the one with the most points.<br/><br/>",

Late at night, they confronted each other in a sudden darkness and dangerous hand-to-hand combat.<br/><br/>The Crossroads is a brief paper-and-pencil game for two players. In a room of 3x3 grids, players take actions concurrently each round and record them on sheets, then make an announcement required to settle their acts.<br/><br/>The basic acts include:<br/><br/>Move: Move to an adjacent grid.<br/><br/>Research: Get the last entry and left directions and round numbers in your position in 8 rounds from the opponent. You have to take a Move act next round.<br/><br/>Attack: Attack the opponent in your position, if he ends round here and doesn&rsquo;t take an attack action, you win. You have to take a Move act next round.<br/><br/>Pursuit: Move and attack the opponent. You have to stay in the new grid without any actions next round.(3 uses only for each player)<br/><br/>For each Move round a player may also take a Challenge, declare his current position and earn points. In a series of consecutive challenges, it&rsquo;s 1 point for the first challenge, 2 points for the second, 4 points for the third, 8 points for the fourth and later ones. After 20 rounds without a successful attack, the player has the most points win the game.<br/><br/>",

That's all up to you!<br/><br/>Xhaos Theory is a scalable miniature wargame allowing players total control over size and setting. You can play a full out large scale battle, or a small skirmish with Xhaos Theory.

It is centered around the British attack on the town of Villers-Bocage and the larger Operation Perch against German positions west of Caen, in Normandy, on 12-14 June 1944. It features engagements between the British 7th Armoured Division-the famed 'Desert Rats' - and the 50th Infantry Division against the elite German Panzer Lehr Division, the 2nd Panzer Division, and the 101 st 55 Heavy Panzer Battalion. 15 Scenarios cover the desperate struggle for the town of Villers-Bocage, 50th Infantry Division's attempt to drive Panzer Lehr out of its positions west of Caen, and panzer ace Michael Wittmann's daring, single-handed counterattack against a column of British armor that changed the course of the battle. A Campaign Game, an Historical Summary, Orders of Battle, and Designer's Notes are included to help put the scenarios in the larger context of operations in Normandy and allow players to design their own scenarios.<br/><br/>",

Firefights center on the machine gun- placement of your MG42's and .30cals are crucial to glorious success or ignominious defeat!<br/><br/>Scale: <br/>1 figure = 1 soldier or vehicle<br/>1 inch = 2 yards<br/>1 turn = approximately 30 seconds<br/>Combat Lull = 2 to 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Keeping track of units stats is made easy with quick reference cards included with every pack, detailing the capabilities of every squad, leader, heavy weapon and vehicle.  Squad level games are fast and furious, taking about 60 minutes to an hour and half.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Squarit is a played on a board containing 16 squares each surrounded by four spaces for tiles, with each pair of adjacent squares sharing one tile space. Each tile space has a specific tile that can be placed on it. The squares are numbered from 4-64 by fours. The edges of the board are also numbered, from 1-4.<br/><br/>The game can be played in two ways. In the aptly-named &quot;Game of Chance&quot; two to five players take turns drawing a tile and placing it on its designated space. The player placing the fourth tile around a square scores the value of the square multiplied by the value of the edge of the board corresponding to the played tile.<br/><br/>The &quot;Game of Skill&quot; is for two players. The scoring rule is the same, but here each player starts with half the blocks and can choose which one to play, generally speaking. If three sides of a block have been played this forces the fourth side to be played as soon as possible, and if that is the third tile for another square it forces that fourth tile immediately, etc.<br/><br/>The designer patented the game some years before publishing it.<br/><br/>Note that the board shown in the patent is not exactly the same as the published version, as the rules state the squares in each quarter of the board sum to 136.<br/><br/>",

The ships are deployed on a map of the Pacific with a grid divided into red and white squares.<br/><br/>On a turn a player moves one piece (or possibly more than one, as the rules are a bit unclear). Battleships and cruisers can move several squares on a turn but are restricted to squares of a particular color. Submarines only move one square a turn but can use either color. Submarines capture enemy ships by landing on them, but the larger ships capture by jumping.<br/><br/>Each side starts the game by mining ten squares on their shores; when an enemy ship crosses such a square a card is drawn which may have a bad effect.<br/><br/>Each side has four objective cards which they randomly select one of at the start of the game, keeping it hidden from the opponent(s). The game is won by the side achieving its objective first.<br/><br/>The game can be played by more than two players by dividing one or both sides between players.<br/><br/>",

The game pieces are the heart, Amor, the devil, 3 male guardian hearts, 7 female guardian hearts and 2 impetuous hearts. They are used to protect the player's heart and impede the opponent's Amor. To do this, the pieces can move in specific ways (like in Chess) and can block or eliminate one another. The devil is the only piece, that can eliminate Amor. When Amor gets in a straight line with another's heart, he can shoot it and wins the game. The game can be played by 2 or 4 players.

Players have to match the corresponding pieces to the different cutouts, which go into different (walled) areas of the game box.<br/><br/>There are several options for play:<br/><br/>(For two players) With the green board in place, give each player a set of the animal pieces, so each player has one of each animal. On their turn, a player rolls the die, and fits the piece shown on the die into the matching hole. When a star is rolled, any piece may be selected. The object is to put all of the pieces into the holes. When the board is lifted, players can see that all pieces are in the correct stable.<br/><br/>(For two players) Place the blue board on the box. Rules are the same as the green board rules, above, except when the board is lifted, the animals are not yet in the right stalls. The second phase begins. The players win if they can sort the animals into the correct stalls.<br/><br/>The components can also be used in more open-ended play:<br/><br/>(For several players and one adult) Only the game box is used, no board is placed on it. The adult tells a story, and the players must do what the story tells them (&quot;The chicken goes to the chicken coop&quot;). The instructions provide ten examples, and more can be created by the adult. For more advanced play, the story can give a sequence of moves (&quot;The cow jumps from the stable to the gardens&quot;).<br/><br/>(An adult and a child) The boards and wooden pieces are not used, only the box. Questions are asked about the scenes on the game box.<br/><br/>- Who lives in the garden? <br/>- Where are the two chicks? <br/>- What color are the animals? <br/>- How many beets are in the pigsty? (2) <br/>- How many apples are in the basket? (4)<br/><br/>",

The Confederate Army is continuing its attack on the Union army, who are retreating towards the safety of Harrisons Landing. This is the largest set battle to date comprising of three battlefields, White Oak Swamp, Glendale and Malvern Hill. The battle is fought over two consecutive days.<br/><br/>Historically it was the best chance that General Robert E Lee would have to break the Union army. The forces are evenly balanced but the Confederates are facing the largest concentration of artillery that the Civil War would see.<br/><br/>Retreat to Harrisons Landing initially has a time limit of 36 bounds in which the Confederates must attack and gain objective ground, the game also comes with additional play options. The games design allows for a fast, fun and realistic game within a 6-8 hour period of continuous play. The game gives a flavour of the American Civil War period and a simple chain of command solution adds intrigue to the game.<br/><br/>Combat is designed around the three factors that appear on the unit counters, these indicate the Range, Attack and Strength of the represented unit. You don&rsquo;t even need any dice to play the game since a dice tile system is included with the game, but if you want to roll dice then it&rsquo;s the simple six sided variety that you will require.<br/><br/>The game board is designed to be used either 2 dimensionally as a straight print and play or 3 dimensionally. The 3D game board gives you a realistic feel to the terrain and shows the tactical dispositions of all the game counters.&quot;<br/><br/>- information from Wargame Shop<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a project of an 8th grade school class in Altensteig/ black forest/ Germany. The game is about an old tradition in this city: On christmas eve big fires are lit on two hilltops in the city. Torchbearers light their torch on one of the fires and spread out in the darkness to make a torch chain across the city.<br/><br/>The game contains a gameboard, playing cards (people: the torch expert and torch novices, several kinds of wood needed for the torch fire = a tree and a wood base, then the wood that is to be stacked), action cards for the players to select their appropriate actions, 5 playing pieces, a torch point marker, one d6 die for dice duels and one die for the actions (one action, two actions, rainy day, unhappy face = sick torchbearers). Then there is the fire itself considering of a stack, a base and 14 wood pieces (actually from plastic).<br/><br/>Gameplay: Each player gets a pawn, action cards, and 3 people cards and 3 wood cards. The game has two phases: first the fire is prepared: Torch bearers have to be found, the wood has to be gathered. Then the wood is stacked. When 14 stacks have been reached (the point marker or one of the player pawns reaches past 14 wood on the game board) the fire is ready to be lit. There is a final dice throw, and then the winner is the one having advanced the furthest up the game board, meaning the one who stacked the most wood.<br/><br/>For the first phase a fire master is chosen - the first one rolling a 6 with the d6-die. Then each player chooses an action - gathering wood or getting torch bearers. The action die thrown by the fire master determines if an action is successful (no rainy day, no sick persons are rolled) and if successful if a single or double action is possible. If more than two players want the same action they roll the d6 to determine who can have a go.<br/><br/>The fire master title changes clockwise to the next player each time a turn is finished.<br/><br/>In the second phase the players - who have to have at least 3 torch bearer cards, one of them being an expert, first plant the tree, then the wood base, then wood stacks. For this they need to have the appropriate type and amount of wood cards. More than two people wanting to do the same roll it out with a d6. The action die determines if an action is successful (no rain), if torch bearer cards must be given up (sick persons) or an action can even be done twice. For a successful action the player pawn is moved one space up on the game board, for a double action two spaces. The point marker moves up one space up too (but only one even when two actions are made). Once the full stack of 14 is reached, either by a player pawn or indicated by the point marker, the game enters its last phase. To maximize their score each player can roll the d6. The player furthest behind has as many die rolls as are players present (e.g. player in 4th place can roll 4 times). If he/she rolls a 6 he/she can move up 4 spaces, player in 3rd place can roll 3 times and move up 3 spaces when rolling a 6 in these 3 rolls). Then the game ends and the player who is up the furthest is the winner.<br/><br/>Apart from the cards the game contains a 3D-woodstack to visualize the fires progress.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bellum se ipsum alet - the Board Game is a game about war and devastation during the Thirty Year's War. The players take on the roles of commanders and have to fight not only each others on the battle field but also the devastation that follows the war. Bellum se ipsum alet is a tactical game but unlike many others in the genre, the resources are not unlimited. The players must continuously feed their armies by storming and occupying cities but the cities will continuously fight to free themselves and for each new occupant, there will be less to plunder. Add to this a battle system where the players need to balance between wasting soldiers to win the battle and saving them for the next battle. Each player must thus find a way to make best use of the scarce and diminishing resources at hand to be able to deliver the final blow at the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>Game mechanisms include:<br/><br/>1. Tile laying: You gain influence by simply passing through areas and leaving your influence tiles behind you. However, you must defend your influence not only against your opponents but also against the cities, that eventually will revolt and reclaim the influence. <br/>2. Resource economy: Your army is no better than your economy, its strength is linked to supply from cities and if you lose the cities, you will eventually (but not immediately) lose your army and the war. <br/>3. Hidden bidding: The battle system is a kind of \\&quot;hidden bidding\\&quot;, which does not reward the player with the strongest army but rather the player who throws in just about more soldiers into the battle. The more you spend, the more you lose, and like Pyrrhus, you may find that your victories are so expensive that they will cause you to lose. <br/>4. Changing game board: The more the cities are conquered, the more they are devastated and the less they will contribute to your army. Your army must claim the victory before there is nothing left to feed it with.<br/><br/>Bellum se ipsum alet is the second game in the Nova Suecia series.<br/><br/>",

The players are competing against each other to be the first shopper to save an amount of money predetermined by the group before play begins. An end goal of $25 is the normal amount for a 4 player, 30 minute game.<br/><br/>You save money as a thrifty shopper by rolling the six (6) dice provided. Each side of each die has either a monetary amount ($1, $2, $3, $5 &amp; $10) or a special character ($, a circular arrow, X or Gift Card) on it. Earning money is as simple as rolling the dice and matching like amounts. After any roll, you must add at least one die to the scoring pool (these are the dice you are attempting to match like amounts with). You may stop rolling to score the amount of money shown on the dice once you have at least four (4) like amounts in your scoring pool. You may continue to roll the remaining dice, if you choose. You may also attempt to roll for the straight. A straight is one of each of the five different dollar amounts on the dice. If a player manages to roll a straight without using any &ldquo;Wild&rdquo; faces, that player may then choose to score $7.00. Should you not be able to add a die to your scoring pool, or once you have scored, your turn ends and the turn passes to the next player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this custom card game, players are adventuring archaeologists trying to remove the most valuable set of items from a seismically unstable cave. The deck contains 54 item cards and 14 seismograph cards. The item cards show an item name, its volume, its weight, and its value. These quantities range from 1 to 5. The seismograph cards show a picture of a seismograph and a number from 1 to 5.<br/><br/>To play, all the cards are shuffled together and the deck is cut into 4 face down piles. Players take turns using action points to uncover cards from the piles and add items to (or remove them from) their backpacks. The backpacks hold a maximum weight of 15 and a maximum volume of 15.<br/><br/>When seismograph cards appear they are put in a separate pile. When the total of the numbers on these cards reaches 21, each player takes one final turn and the game ends.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the one who, at the end, has the most total value for the cards in his or her backpack.<br/><br/>",

On each turn a new debt issue comes into the world economic circuit, which can be purchased in successive turns, and the price will vary as dictated by the rating agencies and the European Central Bank.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to buy the largest possible number of companies for which we have to get the maximum amount of money on successive shifts, buying and selling bonds of debt to debt reserves of the countries they last or the bankrupt companies.

        "description": "Christina Regina - the Board Game is a game about politics and intrigues in 17th century Sweden where each player represents a faction with a hidden agenda. The end of their intrigues is the newly appointed queen Christina of Sweden and their means include persuasion, agitation, manipulation and even assassination. This is achieved by carefully steering the queen towards influence tiles bearing their faction colors and away from other influence tiles. At the same time, they must closely monitor the other players' actions to guess their agendas. But beware, if your own agenda is too obvious, you may yourself become the victim of your opponents' intrigues!<br/><br/>Game mechanisms include:<br/><br/>1. Tile laying: Tiles are laid at the start of the game and make every session unique. <br/>2. Asymmetric scoring: There are no &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; tiles but they all score differently for different players. <br/>3. Hidden agendas: The players do not know how much the other players score until the very end. <br/>4. Guessing game: Based on how players play, the other players may gain points by guessing their agendas (or lose points by guessing wrong).<br/><br/>Christina Regina is the third game in the Nova Suecia series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Vasa Regalis: The Maiden Voyage is a game of the building and launching of the Vasa ship. The players take on the roles of shipyard leaders in 17th century Stockholm who have been given a royal order - the building and launching of the greatest battle ship ever seen. But to manage the delivery, they must procure goods, craft them into building material and use them to build the ship. At the same time, they must make a profit by secretly deciding how much to use for the ship and how much to keep for themselves. The players' total contribution determines the fate of the ship. If she is successful, the player who put most aside wins but if she is a disaster, only the player who put most into the ship will be spared the King's wrath. Each player must thus closely monitor the other players' strategies to determine whether to spend or to save. The victory conditions will not be clear until the game is over - but then it is too late to change the strategy.<br/><br/>Game mechanisms include:<br/><br/>1. Role-based: The players choose roles to perform actions, actions that give some players more benefits than others. <br/>2. Economic balance: The players need to balance between the good types (wood, cloth, iron and sculptures) so that they always have something to work with. <br/>3. Ambiguous victory conditions: The victory conditions depend on the sum of the players' actions and will not be clear until the game ends. <br/>4. Guessing game: A player strategy is not visible to the other players and must be deduced from their actions.<br/><br/>Vasa Regalis is the fourth game in the Nova Suecia series.<br/><br/>",

If you've ever liked UNO, Then you'll love DD Mau!<br/><br/>The deck consists of 80 playing cards, 52 of which are numbered 1 - 13 in four colors.  The remaining 28 cards are &ldquo;Power Cards&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Players get rid of their cards by following the color, matching the number of the card on the discard pile or by playing a &ldquo;POWER CARD&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The hand is over when any player gets rid of all the cards in his or her hand. That player SUBTRACTS the total points from the card or cards that player went out with from their base score. All other players ADD the total of the card or cards in their hand and add it to their base score. The game is over when any player's score EXCEEDS 505 points. In the event that a player's score is 500, 501, 502, 503, 504 or 505 then that player's score is reduced to 400 and play resumes.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the lowest score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blankety Blank is based on the UK BBC TV quiz show of the same name first introduced by Terry Wogan in 1977, itself based on the 1970's version of the US Game Show MATCH GAME.<br/><br/>The game involves guessing the missing &quot;blank&quot; in a sentence. The sentence itself often gives an innocuous clue to the blank. Players then compare answers and score points for matching answers.<br/><br/>One player acts as quizmaster and the other players take turns to be a &quot;contestant&quot; and a &quot;panelist.&quot; The quizmaster decides who the first contestant is going to be the first question is read out and the contestant and panelists write their answers on the sheet provided.<br/><br/>When everyone has recorded their answer, the contestant reads out his answer first, followed by each panelist in turn. Each time that the answer of the contestant matches that of the panelist the contestant gets a point.<br/><br/>The two contestants with the highest number of points then go on to play the &quot;Super Match Game.&quot; In this game there are three possible answers to each question--the answers are worth 50 points, 100 points or 150 points. When a player matches any of these answers, they record the number of points won. The player with the most points at the end of the Super Match is the winner and goes on to the Head to Head game, the last round.<br/><br/>Blankety Blank: Travel allows 3-9 players where the base game allows 3-6, and may be played alone or with the base game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sight Word Spy 1 is a fun and challenging game designed to reinforce sight words and develop spelling skills. The game contains 57 of the first 100 sight words children need to learn to become fluent readers. Each card has one sight word that matches with every other card in the deck!<br/><br/>To play the game in a whole group, pass out one card to each student. The other cards are placed around the room. Children travel around the room to find the sight word on each card that matches with one of the words on their card. Children can write the matching words and/or make a tally mark for each match they find as they go around the room. Students can also work with a partner to find the matching words.<br/><br/>When playing in a small group, one card is dealt to each player with remaining cards face up in a pile in the center.The first player to find their match calls out the word and takes that card. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>",

You are in charge of a group of servants and responsible for extinguishing the fire that has broken out in the royal castle of Tre Kronor. Your servants must set up a human chain together with the other players' servants and pass water buckets to each other. You must also save the possessions from the burning inferno but not at the cost of letting a room burn down. How should you prioritize? What if the other players WANT the room to burn down so that they can steal possessions for themselves? What if you want to do it yourself? Beware, if the entire castle burns down, all players lose!<br/> Game mechanism include:<br/><br/>1. Changing game board: The basic game board is fixed but the spread of the fire is unique for every game. <br/>2. Interdependence: The players cooperate to extinguish the fire. <br/>3. Asymmetric scoring: The score from a room depends on whether it is rescued or burns down. <br/>4. Hidden agendas: The players decide whether they want a room to be rescued or burn down. <br/>5. Guessing game: By guessing the other's agenda, a player can benefit from their actions or disrupt their strategies.<br/><br/>Tre Kronor Infernum is the fifth game in the Nova Suecia series.<br/><br/>",
