Four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles know they must find a way into the skyscraper in order to battle the vicious SHREDDER and stop his plans. But as they make their way through the sewers and along the city streets, they encounter SHREDDER'S henchmen trying to stop them. A ride on the subway can help the Turtles get closer to their goal. A side trip to Baxter Stockman's lab will slow them down. Which Turtle will make it past their enemies and defeat THE SHREDDER? Will it be you?&quot;<br/><br/>There are two sets of rules for the game. The basic game is a simple roll-and-move affair for kids, but the advanced game is much better, and plays somewhat like a stripped-down Buffy the Vampire Slayer.<br/><br/>",

A special team of archaeologists, from all over the world, ventured to the site to solve its puzzle, allowing them inside. Therein, a massive man-made cavern, stretching for what seemed to be a mile straight down, could be seen. But just as the team decided to leave, the door slammed shut, sand slowly started filling the room, and the team was faced with new puzzles to solve. Can they do it in time?<br/><br/>In the real-time cooperative game Curio: The Lost Temple, players take the role of the archaeological team as they try to escape the Lost Temple. To do this, they need to communicate and collaborate to solve an unending slew of puzzles.<br/><br/>Unlike other games in this genre, Curio: The Lost Temple is endlessly replayable, even by the same players. Using a unique module-based system, players manipulate, sort, rotate, and search puzzle components to arrive at a distinct answer.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This card is called the &quot;odd one out&quot;. Players can start any number of sequences, but they can have only one sequence of each color, so the maximum number of sequences is five. Any number can occur only once in a sequence and its mandatory to have one and only one &quot;odd one out&quot; card in the sequence.<br/><br/>The goal is to have the most points by the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Players play the part of sheriffs in the Old West, each trying to capture the highest value collection of outlaws in their jails.<br/><br/>Your jail (aka Calaboose) is a collection of cards kept face up on the table in front of you.  Jails can only hold 5 outlaws at any one time, and each outlaw has a &quot;strength&quot; rating.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can either place an outlaw from your hand into an empty slot in your jail or into someone else's jail.  The outlaws each have &quot;power&quot; ratings.  An outlaw can be sent to replace a weaker outlaw in someone else's jail.<br/><br/>You can defend your jail.  If someone sends an outlaw to your jail, you can eliminate him with one of your outlaws - but you have to send your defender to someone else's jail.  That person can defend against you, of course, so each turn has the possibility of generating a chain reaction that involves multiple players around the table.<br/><br/>It's a lighthearted social game with a solid core of strategy. Higher value cards tend to be weaker, and sets (or &quot;gangs&quot;) are worth much more than singletons.  Everyone at the table can see what's in your jail, so as you gain the advantage you also acquire a bullseye. Attacking another player's jail may backfire on you, so you have to be careful and constantly adjust your strategy to the cards on the table.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When Scrabble was introduced in Sweden in the mid-1950s, it was translated as Alfapet, and sold under that name for decades. In the early 1990's, the rights to the game reverted to the original publisher for some reason, but the rights to the name Alfapet stayed with BRIO.<br/><br/>BRIO had purchased Alga some 10 years before and had made them BRIO's board game arm, phasing out the old board game brand Joker who had been used for all the Scrabble-Alfapets over the year. So BRIO gave Alga the task to invent and publish a new letter-tile-laying game with the name Alfapet, while firstly  Spear's (one edition of Scrabble) and later their new owner Mattel, Inc. (all subsequent editions in Swedish) started publishing Scrabble in Sweden under its original name. It might be interesting to note that Joker's last Alfapet (of Scrabble type) and Spear's first was virtually identical to each other, save some names and logotypes.<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\tJoker's last edition of Scrabble<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t  \t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\tSpear's first and only edition<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t \t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\tAlga's first edition of &quot;new&quot; Alfapet<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/><br/>The name Alfapet was much more known, so this game sold better (most people who had heard of &quot;Scrabble&quot; thought it to be the English version of &quot;Alfapet&quot;).<br/><br/>To a large extent, Alfapet and Scrabble are very similar games. The boards look a bit different; in Alfapet, there are for instance squares that decrease the number of points you get for a word, and there are +4 and *4 squares. With special arrow tiles it is possible to make a turn in the middle of a word. With a stop tile, you are allowed to lay a word directly after another without actually using the letters from the original word. It is also legal to lay a word in parallel adjacent to an existing word, as long as all the words thus created the other way are legal.<br/><br/>To celebrate Alga's 90th anniversary a special limited edition was released called Alfapet Limited Edition. The only known difference in this limited edition is that it has a new dark design.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Scrabble<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player finds himself making both tactical and operational level decisions as well as strategic ones. Much of the richness in the game stems from the fact that the Chinese player must seek to win with the Nationalist or Koumintang forces while at the same time limiting growth to the Chinese Communist strength.<br/><br/>Published in The Wargamer Magazine issue 37.<br/><br/>",

The dice are used as the race cars with the speed recorded on the die so everyone can see the state of the racers with just a glance. The cards are used both as the track which is customizable to the players taste  and as a means to maneuver by matching the track sections you travel over with the same types from your hand.  Some track cards have hazards on them allowing you to put obstacles in your opponent&rsquo;s way forcing them to expend cards or take damage.  Racers also have Nitrous Oxide tanks for an added boost for passing or just staying ahead of the pack.<br/><br/>",

The object is to get a piece to the opposite end of the board.<br/><br/>The basic game is played on a 3&times;10 board and has an addition type of piece, the ship of the dead, which can be used to make a piece invulnerable (temporarily, it is to be supposed).  The advanced game is played on a 5&times;10 board and does not use these pieces.<br/><br/>The B√ºtehorn Spiele (Buchholz Verlag) edition was published in 1979 and won the Spiel des Jahres special award for the most beautiful game in that year.<br/><br/>Hexagames (I) reprinted it in 1983/86 with revised rules by Manuel A. Widmaier (concerning the basic movement of the High Priest and the variation Seti-Beth , now with 2 Pharaohs for each player instead of one !).<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to collect objects to help you or hurt your opponents, and to become types that can use those objects. You can play as multiple types. At the end of the game, a fast-paced lightning round can make or break the winner.<br/><br/>This is a game for 2-6 players. Or, it can be combined with Zombie Ninja Pirates and played with up to 10 players.<br/><br/>There are 3 kinds of cards. Type cards give you points if you are that type at the end of the game. Action cards will allow you to play a quick action, such as become a Type (like the &quot;Bite&quot; card, which lets you become a Vampire), or remove a Type from another player (like &quot;Hair Remover&quot;, to remove a Werewolf type). Finally, Object cards you want to try to collect, and will give you points if you are a type that can use that Object. For example, &quot;Sparkles&quot; are +3 points for Fairies, but -3 points for Vampires, because we all know that real Vampires *don't* sparkle.<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Zombie Ninja Pirates<br/><br/><br/>",

A bright sunny day &ndash; scarlet strawberries, sweet-scented raspberries, tasty apples, still warm pink scum, the humming of bees... Or a winter evening &ndash; cold outside, warm inside, a burning lamp, tea is ready &ndash; all that's left to choose is cherry or peach? Gooseberry or currant? Why not open a few jars and taste some of each. Of and it would be lovely to bake some pies with jam...<br/><br/>Now you can not only eat jam, you can play The Jam. In this game you need to make all sorts of jam and bake pies. At the start of the game each player has a hand of four cards and a task sheet; the sheet shows different combinations of jam and pies that you need to make to earn extra points at the end of the game. Players receive points by completing tasks, and also for each jam they make and each pie they bake. The one who has the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>All cards in the game can be used as either an Ingredient (the image at the bottom of the card) or a Recipe (jam, pies or fruit salad &ndash; the upper part of the card). At the beginning of the game the top eight cards are placed on the table face up, forming the Basket with Ingredients, fruits and berries.<br/><br/>How do we make jam? A player plays a jam Recipe from his hand, then places the necessary Ingredient on top of it, which he takes from the Basket (&quot;Raspberry jam&quot; from the hand + Raspberry from the Basket and so on). Fruit salad and pies are made a similar way, only to make a pie you need to use a completed jam Recipe (by yourself or one you received from trade) instead of taking it from the Basket.<br/><br/>The game is turn-based, and each player's turn has a few phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw a card &ndash; take the top card from the deck.<br/>     Trade &ndash; players can trade Recipes they made with other players.<br/>     Play a card &ndash; you can make jam, bake pies, make a fruit salad; you can use one of the special rules; finally you can play a card as an Ingredient and place it in the Basket.<br/>     Discard &ndash; you must discard Ingredients used to make a Recipe on your previous turn. <br/><br/><br/>The game has a few special cards with special features:<br/><br/><br/>     &quot;The Bear&quot; goes to the player with the most baked pies and awards him 10 points &ndash; but eats one of the pies.<br/>     &quot;Karlsman&quot; goes to the player who can offer him the most jam; he grants 7 points but eats the jam.<br/>     &quot;Cone jam&quot; can be made using any Ingredient, and can then be used to make any pie.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends once all the cards are used, including cards in the players' hands. Points are counted to see who the winner is. Different players complete the tasks on their task sheets differently: Some try to make &quot;Winter jam&quot; or bake &quot;Pies for granny&quot;, while others collect &quot;Favorite fruit&quot;. At the end of the game it becomes clear who made the correct choices that led to sweet victory!<br/><br/>",

The aim is to score 10,000 or more points (although with 6 or more players you can decide to play to 5,000 or 7,500 points).<br/><br/>There are 110 cards - 14 each of 1-6, 22 Farkles and 4 score summary cards. Each player is dealt one card BUT all players can play off anyone else's cards. The rest of the deck is placed in the middle of the table and each player takes it in turn to draw one card from the deck and place it in front of themself or another player. The goal is to create combinations that score (eg three 1s = 300 points, three 6s = 600 points, six of any number = 3,000 points and so on). If you create a winning combination you can either slide it to the center of the table for potential scoring or leave it where it is to try and build a bigger score. You can stop drawing at any time and score any cards you've placed in the center. However, if at any time you draw a Farkle card you MUST stop drawing, and any cards in the center can't be scored and become part of the face-up cards in front of you. You keep your Farkle card to one side and no other players may take it but you may use it to score later. Farkle cards are scored whenever their owner makes a successful scoring combination. The first player to 10,000 points (or the agreed total) wins!<br/><br/>The publisher places no limit on the number of players.<br/><br/>",

Maybe it's going to be you, but first you'll have to take out your brothers. <br/>Shootings, cops and bribes: you'll have to handle your resources with care to obtain the respect that a New York underworld Boss needs!<br/>La Famiglia is a game with high player interaction in which you'll have to carefully manage your hand to use each card's power to the max. Each turn you'll play exactly one card, representing a gangster that you want to add to your den, using a mechanic of interlocking card colours. You'll use its effect to gain respect points or to damage your opponent's dens, but be careful: each card played will attract the attention of the police, that will eventually raid you.

        "description": "Witty Pong is the first release from French publisher MyWittyGames, which invites gamers to fund projects that they want to see released.<br/><br/>As far back as 2005, designer Antoine Bauza was trying to encapsulate the essence of ping-pong in a board or card game, but his design efforts never came to fruition, so the project was shelved &ndash; until mid-2010 when he chanced to show the prototype to Bruno Cathala. Cathala suggested a few changes, then the pair worked together to bring the game to the table.<br/><br/>In Witty Pong the ping-pong table is recreated by laying four cards in a 2x2 square, with a ball token being placed on one of the cards. On a turn, a player flips a card and places it on one of the three cards not covered by the ball. Two situations can occur:<br/><br/>&bull; If the card depicts a ball somewhere in the artwork, the player must move the ball token to a new card. If he says anything or hesitates too long, he loses one of the three banana tokens with which he started the game.<br/><br/>&bull; If the card doesn't have a ball on it, the player must say the &quot;proper&quot; word, with the word being determined by the letters and colors on the three uncovered cards. The word starts with &quot;P&quot; or &quot;T&quot; depending on which letter shows more frequently, and ends with &quot;ong&quot; or &quot;ing&quot; depending on whether more blue or red paddles are showing. If he says the wrong word or takes too long, he loses a banana.<br/><br/>Lose all your bananas, and you're out of the game. Last moneky standing wins. The game includes advanced rules that change what to say if the same letter or color is on all three paddles; additional rules allow for competitive play in which players can steal bananas from one another if they say the right word first.<br/><br/>",

Whoever has the most frogs left in the tree wins that round. Includes 24 frogs, 4 launchers, base, tree trunk with tree top and 4 tree limbs and instruction sheet. Requires 3 &quot;AA&quot; batteries.<br/><br/>The flexible, rubbery plastic frogs are shaped to hang easily from the tree branches, but when the branches pop up, these little amphibian friends tend to go flying.<br/><br/>The brown tree trunk and blue game base are made with a sturdy, durable plastic. The green branches are made lighter for extra spring when the frogs land -- and when time is up. The lily pad-shaped catapults work really well -- so well, in fact, they'll fly too if you don't hold them down with a finger.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "extrapolated from session report:<br/><br/>The theme of the game is based on the legendary necklace of Saba, which went to the grave with its owner upon her death. Sadly, dastardly grave robbers plundered the tomb and the valuable gems which comprised the necklace were scattered across the globe. Now, a wealthy sheik is anxious to reassemble the necklace and present it as a gift to his lovely bride. Players are charged with the task of assisting the sheik, attempting to purchase the many gems at auction and then reassemble the necklace in the proper fashion.<br/><br/>The board depicts the frame of the necklace, with space for its 36 missing gems. In total, there are 44 gems in the deck, many of which will ultimately prove to be forgeries. Depending upon the number of players, each player receives from 3 - 7 gems to begin the game, along with $20,000. Four gems are revealed from the remainder of the deck and positioned into the frame.<br/><br/>The game is played in two major phases. During the first phase, players alternate placing a gem up for auction, ala Modern Art. The auctioneer receives the funds from the high bidder, who receives the gem. The winner has the option of keeping the gem, or placing it into the frame. If placed in the frame, the gem earns $2,000 for other gems it touches and those radiating from it in straight lines, including itself. During phase 2, the reward is reduced to only $1,000 per gem.<br/><br/>Following an auction, the auctioneer has the opportunity to purchase another gem from the deck for $2,000.  <br/>Phase 1 ends when the gem deck expires. Phase 2 then begins with players reconstructing the necklace. In turn, each player places a gem into the frame and earns funds as described above.<br/><br/>The twist in the game are the rules which must be followed in reconstructing the necklace. The main rules are:<br/><br/><br/>     The necklace must be symmetrical, with left and right halves containing the same jewels in the same places. All cards appear twice in the game, so what appears on the left side must appear in the same position on the right side. The only exception to this is the center column. Any duplicate pieces are considered forgeries and are worthless. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Pieces of jewelry containing the same type of gem must be placed in uniform columns. Thus, the first gem placed in a column dictates what kind of gem must appear in that same column. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     The number of gems on a card can only be one greater than the number of gems on the cards directly above it. <br/><br/><br/>Once the first gem is placed in a column, it 'locks' that column AND the corresponding symmetrical column. Only gems which meet the above rules can subsequently be placed there.<br/><br/>The game ends once the necklace is completed. The player with the most money is victorious.<br/><br/>",

An object for which he already 3 or more copies in its collection. In this case he sells the object to any fellow player who has from 0-4 copies of the object in his collection. The fellow player cannot reject the purchase and must pay the seller 20000. The buyer moves his marker to the appropriate field. If this causes the marker to move to the third position, he should immediately receive a bonus of 30,000 marks from the bank.<br/><br/>Note: the fourth and fifth objects of a type are thus always sold; one never receives these two objects from an object card that they have won for auction.<br/><br/>Buying more than 3 types of art makes ones collection decrease in value.

Two or more numbers can be combined to form multiple digit numbers.  The players race to form a valid equation with some or all of the their cubes.  He calls &quot;TUF&quot; and starts a 3 minute timer.  If another player forms an equation with more cubes, he starts a 2 minute timer and calls &quot;TUFFER&quot;.

(How little things have changed since...)<br/><br/>Your net worth is kept track of using a slide rule of sorts, dubbed the &quot;ladder of success&quot;.  The first player to move into the Ritz by buying or winning steps on his ladder wins.  You can buy into up to four opportunities at once; when you land on another player's opportunity, you can attempt to &quot;bail him out&quot; of it by paying the bail out price and beating him on the dice.<br/><br/>The &quot;Chance of a Lifetime&quot; circle is entered on doubles or by landing on an entry space; if you enter it, you may roll as often as you wish, hoping to land on the Big Deal space (which gives you 3 ladder steps) or another good space (where you sell your opportunities for varying profit).  Of course, the circle also includes bad spaces, so there is considerable risk...<br/><br/>A few other spaces round out the board, giving you the opportunity to challenge other players (swapping a ladder step) and other things like that.<br/><br/>The game is sort of a cross between Can't Stop and Monopoly.<br/><br/>",

If the player lands on a brick, stick or straw square they take a house piece of that type from the pile on the table.

Players are aiming to collect both pieces of each house, which are slotted together in front of them.<br/>If the player lands on a wolf square, they spin the wolf spinner. If the spinner points to a stick or straw house, the player may take one of those pieces from another player saying &quot;I&rsquo;ll huff and I&rsquo;ll puff, and I will blow your house down!&quot; If they do not need the house piece, because they have already completed that house, they take the piece and return it to the relevant pile on the table. If the spinner points to the brick house, the wolf cannot blow it down, so the player cannot take another player&rsquo;s house piece.<br/>When a player has assembled all three houses, they have to continue to play in order to reach the safety of the middle of the playing board (throwing the exact number, or more to move there). Other players can still take pieces of their completed straw and stick houses.

        "description": "From the back of the box.<br/><br/>Fleet Admiral is a card game about becoming a fleet admiral.  Take your intrepid crew on missions, earn prestige, upgrade your ship.  Solve a galactic crisis.  And do it all faster than your opponents, because they want to be in charge too.<br/>End of box<br/><br/>You are in command of a space vessel from one of the major powers of the Portable Galactic Empire (Human, Brerasan, Hragsh or Jasl-Riin). You want to become the fleet admiral.<br/><br/>You begin the game with a frigate from your race with a power/up grade cost of 1.  One level 1 crew member (orange shirt AKA (also known as) Operations, or a green shirt AKA Marine, or a blue shirt AKA Command) think Star Trek shirts with the colors changed.<br/><br/>You also draw one level 1 Component card.  there are four types (weapons, power, sensors and defence). Each of these card types has three specialty sub groups in their category.  When you add these cards to your ship you put them under your player board (ship), similar to Glory to Rome.<br/><br/>Game play:<br/>There are two decks of cards (component and crew).  On your turn you go on a &quot;mission&quot;.  An 8 sided die is rolled. Four symbols on the die match the crew deck, 4 match the component deck, 1 thumbs up and 1 explosion. If you roll a symbol with one of the two deck symbols you draw one card from that deck.  On the upper portion of the card there will be one or two symbols.  If you don't have Crew or Components that match the symbol or symbols the mission is failed. If you can match the first card you must roll again and draw another card. Now you must be able to match up evenly with what is on the cards to what is on your ship.  Lets say the first card required a missile.  This is a subset of the weapon card.  So if you have a weapon card on your ship it must also be specific to the missile to pass phase one of this mission.  The second card drawn required an orange shirt.  Lets say you only have a green shirt assigned to the security section of your ship.  No worries. As captain you count as one crewman of any shirt color.  You have passed the second part of the mission. You could push your luck and roll the die again for a third part of the mission, but if you fail the requirement of the third card the entire mission fails.  So you stop at two.  You may now attach these cards to your ship if you wish. The first card was a crewman. You assign his orange shirt self to your medical station. The second card was Defenses, sub-set shields. You put it on your ship.  These cards now help you win future missions.<br/><br/>If you roll the thumbs up symbol you pick a card from either deck and auto pass that stage no matter what.  If it is the explosion the whole mission is failed, no matter what.  There are a few more rules in this area but that's the bulk.<br/><br/>As missions progress you can use cards earned from winning missions to upgrade your ship.  Bigger ship equals more crew that can be attached and more powerful weapons.  When you upgrade to a battleship a crisis starts to perk.  This is abstract.  At the beginning of a players turn (battleship or higher in possession) a crisis chit is placed in a pool on the table.  Once that pool grows to double the amount of players a crisis has begun.  If the pool grows beyond four times the players at the table everyone loses the game.  You knock the chits down on your turn by taking cards you have won during the mission and instead of adding them to your ship you discard them. Each won card discarded removes a chit.<br/><br/>There is some coop stuff possible on missions and if you beat the crisis you add up the point totals on your ship cards to determine the winner or &quot;fleet admiral&quot;.<br/><br/>A light game that could be used as a filler or just with beer and pretzels.<br/><br/>A little tongue in cheek ship captain card play fun that takes about half an hour.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "15 Minutes to Self-Destruct is a co-operative game of escaping a spaceship that is about to explode. Preferably before it explodes. The problem is, the self destruction sequence has been set by the ship's AI running wild, and that same AI is still trying to stop the players from fleeing. To successfully flee, the players have to activate the escape pod by turning on 13 switches all over the ship. To reach the switches they have to unlock the doors that block the way between them.<br/><br/>The way all this happens is simple: on your turn you can either roll the dice to unlock doors on your half of the ship OR move your astronaut through doors that have previously been unlocked. You try to reach the switches to be able to turn them on. Sometimes you roll a dice combination that you cannot use. When that happens you have to draw a card that may lock unlocked doors, or deactivate activated switches. To win the game, all astronauts have to reach the escape pod in the center of the board before the time has run out, after all switches have been turned on.<br/><br/>The game is played using a free timer app downloaded to a smartphone. The timer also plays atmospheric sounds that remind the players of the urgency of the situation.<br/><br/>",

Set in the Olaf mansion, one player is Count Olaf, while the other player(s) are the Baudelaire children. The game lasts roughly 24 turns, which is how long it will take Mr. Poe to travel to the bank and back to the mansion to visit the children. While he's gone, it is Count Olaf's job to successfully play Tragedy cards to damage The Guardians health (by moving into a room in the manor on which The Guardian's marker is in then playing a special card), while the children attempt to collect items in the manor with which they can thwart Olaf's schemes and restore health to The Guardian. The children win if Poe manages to get back from the bank, but Olaf wins if he drains all of The Guardian's health and kills him. The theme is extremely well used in this high-presentation childrens game.<br/><br/>Excerpt from the box:<br/>&quot;If you wish to play a game where the hero always wins, the villain is forever defeated, and innocent children are brought to warmth and safety, then I encourage you to put this box down immediately and for something involving lollipops, ponies, or educational flashcards. The lives of Violet, Sunny, and Klaus Baudelaire are fraught with sorrow, mis-fortunate, and unpleasantness, and the game in their honor contains the exact same things.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Throughout the course of the game, players can also recruit Alchemists, Professors, and Artificers to their cadre of loyal vassals, each with their own unique abilities.

Become the likes of the notorious Dick Turpin, the suave Claude Duval or the Wicked Lady Katherine Ferrers.<br/><br/>You may form alliances with other players or strike it out for yourself, but be warned alliances between these knights of the roads do not last forever.<br/><br/>Start the game by selecting your highwayman. Then draw a number of coach cards equal to the number of players. Secretly pick which coach to rob then negotiate with other players at the same coach whether to share or fight for the spoils. If there are no other players then you rob the coach. But be warned some coaches are more heavily armed than others or may even be an ambush.<br/><br/>Your goal is to amass as much loot as you can whilst avoiding the Red Coats and the Tyburn Gallows.<br/><br/>",

By rolling the dice, players move around the board game and as they pass over the positions where the envelopes are, they pick up the tile and see if it has the secret formula printed on the bottom of the tile.  The winner of the game is the one that exits the board game from one of its four entrance/exit gates.<br/><br/>There is a clear moving piece representing a security guard that moves around from one room to another room.

Players will draft troops, acquire demonic spells to challenge or be challenged by other players in a series of epic duels. Victors of the duels are awarded souls as bounties.<br/><br/>During the game, players will deduce their teammates, fend off challengers and win duels to stay alive in order to collect as many souls as possible. The faction with the most number of souls shall be the ultimate winner!<br/><br/>The duel:<br/>On his turn, the player must either initiate a duel with any other player or change all 5 cards on his hand at the cost of forfeiting his next turn. (only applicable if no cards on his hand has damage point on it.)<br/>After choosing the opponent to duel with, the player must play any combat card face down. The opponent will respond by also placing the combat card of his choice face down. Once both sides have decided that they are ready, the dueling combat cards are revealed. By default, the player with the higher damage point wins the duel and gets to draw a soul card while the defeated player loses 1 health. If the player choose to play any action combat card during or after the duel, the outcome of the duel will depend on the function of the action card. E.g. If negate (action) combat card is played, the whole duel is annulled and nobody wins or loses the duel.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/>The goal is to collect souls by dueling against opponents or even your own teammates. When a faction has been eliminated, the total number of souls per faction will be tabulated and the faction with the most souls wins!<br/><br/>",

For thrills and entertainment, only courageous and brave souls dare drive these bumper cars. With your band of young punks, you must prove to the world that you can drive better than your opponent, and claim the best part of the track for you and your team.<br/>Players drive bumper cars for their respective teams. The basic principle of the game is to push other cars out of the way in order to be in a better scoring position at the right time. The corrupt operator rampages through the Autodrome while busily maintaining the bumper car attraction in perfect working condition. Both teams try to convince the operator to give them unfair advantages.<br/>From time to time, the operator has to repair the overhead grid. Damaged grid sections are marked by signal bells. If a bumper car hits any of the bells, the car is expelled and the grid must be repaired. The operator immediately assesses the position of all cars to determine if a car is traversing a section currently under repair. If so, that car becomes disabled.<br/>Players score points by placing &amp; keeping their cars on higher-value sections and by pushing their opponent&rsquo;s cars onto lower-value sections of the Autodrome. A player can also score points by pushing an opponent&lsquo;s car off the track.<br/>In order to maximize the fun and to keep the game entertaining and challenging, the operator reassembles the Autodrome in a new configuration prior to the start of each game of &quot;Crash by Crash.&quot;<br/><br/>",

In fact, so poorly they had to be taken away because their Immortality was wearing rather thin.<br/>And... as Fate would have it they died right on time, left, right and center. The best place for these unfortunate victims was somewhere deep, dark and damp. Not too much unlike a pit (and people were dying to get there).<br/><br/>Plague! Is a germ-free board game, we hope, for those of you who dare to transport wagon loads of infected victims to their final resting place, a deep pit at Clarks Hill. <br/> Object: Inspired by the yodel 'Bring out your Dead' the object of the game, for those who wish to play, is for each player to control a wagon which is used to visit the houses. Plague victims are 'claimed' and taken away to a burial site. All this whilst avoiding rats and fleas. The first to 'bury' 99 victims wins (remember, you're only doing your job). The winner must now go off and infect the rest of England.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Stratos, players assume the role of rival tribes vying for control of a newly discovered land. Players succeed in their quest by hiring and developing groups of characters that can accumulate resources and exercise unique abilities. Players collect resources from the game board through character actions and spend them to hire new characters and advance their tribe.<br/><br/>Stratos has 5 character classes, each serving a distinct function. The 5 classes and their (promoted forms) are the Peasant (Cultivator), Archer (Marksman), Soldier (Knight), Explorer (Swashbuckler) and Mage (Sorcerer). Each promoted class gains expanded abilities compared to its original version. Enhanced abilities include greater attacks (Knight vs. Soldier), access to stronger spells (Sorcerer vs. Mage), improved resource harvesting (Cultivator vs. Peasant), expanded movement (Swashbuckler vs. Explorer) and increased attack accuracy (Marksman vs. Archer). Characters move from space to space on a tile-based board which can be arranged randomly or according to set maps. Each character can perform up to 2 unique actions per turn with movement being a repeatable action. Available character actions (dependent on class) include Harvest, Travel, Search, Attack, Shoot, Defend, Cast and Use.<br/><br/>Points are awarded by defeating characters, casting unique spells, discovering treasures, hoarding resources, promoting characters and occupying key map locations.<br/><br/>The first player to reach a pre-determined number of Prosperity points (default 10) is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Stratos is a product of Board and Tale Games Inc., a Canadian boardgame publisher based in Hamilton, Ontario.<br/><br/>",

The game is for 3 - 7 players and takes less than an hour to play.<br/><br/>Dubious Alliance is best described as a 'cooperative backstabber'. Players work together to survive the Orc realm of Hirntodia. To win, a Player must 'lie, cheat and steal' to negotiate favorable cards (magic, treasure, victory) and gain the highest Prestige value in trading cards by trading away negative cards (Traps, Monsters and more).<br/><br/>However, because you are a band, you can't out right kill your competition. If an Orc player dies, the game ends and everyone loses! So on the one hand, you are working together to survive and on the other, you need to keep your competition weak so you can win... truly a Dubious Alliance.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "M is for Mouse &mdash; alternatively known as A bis Z or Der kleine Rabe Socke: Buchstabensuche &mdash; is a children's game in which players want to rid themselves of cards in hand. Each card features two letters on it as well as two images familiar to children. Each player starts with three cards in hand, and three cards are laid out on the table.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player covers a card on the table with a card from their hand, matching one of the letters on the covered card with an image on the card they played or vice versa. Thus, you could play a card with an A on top of a card showing an apple, or you could play an apple on an A. After playing, you cover this letter on the central letter board to show that no one else can use this letter for the remainder of the round. If you can't play, you must pass. Whoever plays last will have hand size that's one card smaller at the start of the next round, and whoever manages to reduce their hand size to zero wins.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to get rid of your cards, which represent (among other things) the money you have left in this poker game. Of course, a lot of the cards make you draw more cards, and a lot of them require that you have a Brain.<br/><br/>Dead Money is a quick-playing and clever variation on a classic Cheapass game, and it features glorious cowboy zombies by artist Brian Snoddy.<br/><br/>",

If your goods weigh more than the goods that Aunt Trudel has set aside, then you get nothing!<br/><br/>In Tante Trudels Tr&ouml;del, players shop from a 5x5 array of goods, each with their own basket. One item &ndash; a coat hanger, a vase, a dollhouse couch &ndash; is placed on most of the spaces in the array, while a few spaces are covered with vouchers. Three items are set aside at random, and those are the goods that Aunt Trudel will weigh at checkout to see whether you'd met her tough standards.<br/><br/>All players start on the same corner of the game board with a shopping basket. On a turn, a player rolls a die, moves her basket that many spaces around the game board in a clockwise direction, then picks up one item (or voucher) from the row that her basket is next to and places it in her basket. If a player's basket lands on the same location as an opponent's basket, then the player can take an item from the opponent instead. If a player picks up a voucher, she can exchange it later for another item on the board, putting the voucher in its place, in addition to taking an item. The first player to circle the board has the option of then moving counter-clockwise to pick up more goods; everyone else is finished once they circle the game board.<br/><br/>Each player in turn then weighs her goods against Aunt Trudel's holdings using the funky cardboard scale included in the box. If your goods weight more than Trudel's, you're out; if not, then you're still in the game. Of those players, whoever has the heaviest goods wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Super All Green was originally published in 2014 for 2-4 players, and a second edition was issued in 2015 as ALL GREEN for 2-6 players.<br/><br/>ALL GREEN is a card game that simplifies the rules and play of Japanese Mahjong by reducing the types of cards and scoring hands. This edition is very portable, with two decks of small sized cards. One deck is the Tenbo cards, showing scoring points in values of 10P, 5P and 1P. The other deck is only the green bamboo suite (Ryuiso), hence the game being called all Green. The other Mahjong suites and tiles, such as Dragons, are not represented.<br/><br/>As in Mahjong, players repeatedly draw a card from the deck and discard one from their hand, trying to build a scoring combination from the five cards they hold after drawing. The combinations in All Green are simply a pair (the Head), and either a Run (Shuntsu) or a Meld.<br/><br/>Based upon the value of the winning hand, players discard their points cards accordingly. The first player to get down to zero wins, or the player with the fewest points after two rounds.<br/><br/>RULES:<br/><br/>From the Tenbo points deck, players get a 10P, two 5P, and five 1P cards, giving a total of 25 points.<br/><br/>Then, after shuffling the bamboo deck well, players are dealt four hand cards each. The remainder are placed face down as a draw deck. Play goes clockwise, with each player taking turns to draw one card from the deck, and discard one card from their hand.<br/><br/>Once a player has a Pair and a Run or a Meld, they call and score. Then they discard Tenbo cards for the score. Players reshuffle the bamboo deck and play another round, until one players gets to zero points. More usually, play continues until everyone has lead twice, at which point the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>„ÇΩ„Éº„Ç∫„Å®„Éè„ÉÑ„Å†„Åë„ÅÆÈ∫ªÈõÄ„Ç´„Éº„Éâ„Ç≤„Éº„É†„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ<br/>5Êûö„ÅÆ„Ç´„Éº„Éâ„ÇíÊèÉ„Åà„ÇãÁ∞°ÊòìÁâà„ÅÆÈ∫ªÈõÄ„Ç´„Éº„Éâ„Ç≤„Éº„É†„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ<br/>„Åù„Çå„Åû„Çå25ÁÇπ„ÅÆÁÇπÊï∞„ÇíÊåÅ„Å£„Å¶„ÄÅÁÇπÊï∞„ÇíÂèñ„ÇäÂêà„ÅÑ„Åæ„Åô„ÄÇ<br/>Ë¶™„Åå2Âë®„Åô„Çã„Åã„ÄÅË™∞„Åã„ÅÆÁÇπÊï∞„Åå0Êú™Ê∫Ä„Å´„Å™„Çã„Å®ÁµÇ‰∫Ü„Åß„Åô„ÄÇ<br/>ALL GREEN is a simplified Mahjong card game. Unlike Mahjong which has 34 types of tiles, this game only has nine types of bamboo cards and green dragon cards.<br/><br/>Each round, players are dealt four cards each. They take turns drawing one card and discarding one card until someone completes a winning hand of one pair and a set of three cards (in sequence or of a kind). The winner gains points from opponents according to the difficulty of the winning hand.<br/><br/>Players initially have 25 points. A game consists of rounds equal to twice the number of players, but may immediately end when a player has negative points.<br/>At the end of the game, the player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Your hand is made up of eleven cards, each with a letter on it in one of three colors (blue, green, or red), in addition to several wild cards scattered throughout the deck.<br/><br/>To get rid of your cards you must first meet the goal of the round, which is to play a particular number of pure or mixed words (made up of letters of one color entirely or a combination of colors, respectively) as determined by a set of included cards.<br/><br/>Once a player has made their first goal, they can then get rid of their remaining cards by changing their own words or those of their opponents, by inserting letters, covering letters, or adding prefixes or suffixes.  First person to get rid of their entire hand wins the round and scores the points for every card remaining in his/her opponents' hands.  Highest score after ten rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "450 Things to Do in Your Life is a voting game where players guess which activities their opponents would like to try and vote accordingly. It is a perfect game to get to know each other better and get the party started!<br/><br/>In 450 Things to Do in Your Life you will find 75 double-sided playing cards, each side contains three different activities. The lead player opens the card, and the player to the left side of him or her calls a random number of the activity. The lead player reads the task out loud.<br/><br/>After that, each of the players assesses their readiness to perform a particular task with a set of special voting cards that go from 0 - &quot;I wouldn't do it - not in a million years&quot; to 3 - &quot;Wow, I'd love to try it!&quot;.<br/><br/>When all the players have voted they try to guess an approximate amount of points on the voting cards - a player who will be closer to the correct answer gets one winning point. So in order to win the game it is important to know and feel the other players: what they think of practical jokes, what will be considered funny, and what will be rejected as a stupid idea. The first player to reach 12 points wins the game.<br/><br/>During the game the players will not only have fun but also learn a lot about each other, and, perhaps, they even learn something new about themselves. Finally you can actually think about all the fun and crazy things to do in your life, like: &quot;Am I ready to shave my head? Or scuba dive, or kiss a frog?&quot;<br/><br/>Find out how well you know each other in this quirky party game!<br/><br/>",

Fight monsters, find hats, forage for food all while taking in the nuance and cunning of haiku!<br/><br/>This game pits players against a series of Quests to stop the &quot;Order of the One Extra Syllable&quot;, who are creating discord in the world.  Each player selects one of the four heroes, who proceeds to The Shop to spend any coins he or she may have on new gear (better weapons, healing fruit, bicep oil, or lucky cream), and then ventures forth into the first Quest.<br/><br/>The series of Quests are six separate decks of Quest cards, which include monster cards and saving throw cards.  If you draw a monster card, you roll appropriate dice for your attack, add any modifiers your character has, then subtract that number from the monster's hit points.  If the monster is still alive, you roll to see what attack it makes on your character.  Your character and monster fight until one of you dies.  If your character survives the fight, he or she gains one or more souls (VPs) and a number of coins (for spending at The Shop).  If your character does not survive, well ... we hope you have collected some souls so you can return to the game!  As a survivor of one or more monsters, you might draw a saving throw card from the Quest deck -- your character could gain treasure, hat racks, fruit, or a disaster!  Roll well when disaster hits!<br/><br/>As your character proceeds through the six Quest decks, the other players' characters are proceeding through the same Quests, and collecting souls.  The hero with the most souls at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>The game also includes the &quot;Tower of Many Muses&quot; expansion, with guest haiku written by Ryan North, Robin Laws, MC LARS, Ali Spagnola, Parry Gripp, Jim Zub, Becky Cloonan, Masked Intruder, Lunar Baboon, &amp; more!  You play this expansion cooperatively as you fight monster after monster, trying to survive to the end of the deck!  Those who survive should write a haiku about their adventure ...<br/><br/>",

Will you survive this bloodcurdling knock-out race? Who among you is the true Survivor?<br/><br/>Goal of the game:<br/>The player who, after the Merge, has cast the most votes for the last standing tribe member wins Expeditie Robinson.<br/><br/>Game-play:<br/>Expeditie Robinson is played in 2 phases:<br/>1. The Team Phase (2 islands)<br/>2. The Merge (1 island, every man for himself)<br/><br/>The Team Phase (2 islands)<br/>Each team tries to accomplish 3 different missions before the Team Phase ends.<br/><br/>With each of the three missions the teams can earn an extra voting card to be used in the next phase.<br/><br/>The 3 missions<br/>&deg; Have more tribe members (pawns) than the opposing team.<br/>&deg; Have &ldquo;explored&rdquo; (turned over) more island tiles than the opposing team. <br/>&deg; Have more provisions left than the opposing team.<br/><br/>The teams take turns.

It doesn't matter if the tile has been explored already. by doing this you can explore the tiles you've added and find provisions. With these provisions you can feed your tribe members and build tools.<br/><br/>During a turn a team can perform every possible combination of these two actions. As well as actions, you are always allowed to make a campfire and tools without the cost of action points.<br/><br/>Elimination challenge<br/>Whenever the 'Elimination challenge' tile has been revealed the challenge is played. The teams each take their own sets of dice and take turns. They must try to build a tower of six dice, with &ldquo;6&rdquo; at the bottom, followed by &ldquo;5&rdquo;, then &ldquo;4&rdquo;, then &ldquo;3&rdquo;, then &ldquo;2&rdquo;, and finally &ldquo;1&rdquo; on top.

Players that belonging to the team that won a mission during the Team Phase gets 1 extra vote for every mission they won.<br/> Voting<br/>Players cast their votes in secret. Putting every voting card they possess into a slot in the voting tray. <br/>On the voting tray each slot has its own color. These colors represent tribe members. Casting a vote into the red slot means voting for the red tribe member. Of course you will do what you can for your chosen tribe member to be the last one standing.<br/><br/>The knock-out race begins<br/>Just as in the Team Phase, a player playing his turn has the two same action points and actions that can be used.<br/><br/>The players try to find food for the tribe member they voted for so they stay in the game. But not to obvious, otherwise they might get discovered and thrown out by other players.<br/><br/>One by one the tribe members will get eliminated. The game will continue this way until there&rsquo;s only one tribe member left. This is the last standing tribe member, in other words, the true Survivor.<br/><br/>Now the time has come for an exciting moment &minus; who voted for this tribe member and how many votes did he cast?

It features four butt characters that the players can play as, and plenty of uniquely drawn toilet papers.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the player with the most sets of toilet paper when the game ends. This is done by gathering toilet paper cards and laying them down when you have a full set that matches your butt character. There are plenty of action cards to steal, draw, or otherwise shift the game in your favor, and some that can be used to change the butt characters. The game ends as soon as the last space ship part is drawn from the deck.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to collect 5 points. Each fishing boat and hunter you shove off the board gets you one point. On your turn, you may shove three ice floes onto the board. But be careful, because if you shove an animal off the board, your turn ends immediately! The first player to collect a combination of 5 fishing boats and hunters ends and wins the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each magician now has the task of convincing the King that they are the best Court Magician. To do this, they organize a grand tournament of magic with various competitions. For each contest, players must make a fabulous creature composed of a blend of three real animals. These chimeras then compete in various events to determine the best magician.<br/><br/>The three-ingredient creatures are created simultaneously by all players drawing from the three decks of creatures before them, placing the cards facedown on one of the four contest areas before them. (Each player possesses a large square representing each of the four contests in their personal play area.) Once players have chosen their three ingredient creatures for each of the four contests (twelve in total), they may switch ingredient creature pieces between their four different contest tiles.<br/><br/>Contests may include mud-wrestling, funniest creature, battle to first blood, potato bag race, and the prettiest creature. Only four are chosen from the deck of available contests, and only the players in first and second place in each contest receive points. The first player to complete their selections for all four contests may declare they are finished, putting a time limit of 30 seconds for all other players to complete their choices.<br/><br/>Voting takes place between players to see who has the best creature featured in each contest.<br/><br/>Three rounds are played with the aforementioned steps, with creature and contest cards being reshuffled and redrawn. Each round is roughly 10-15 minutes, totaling to 30-45 minutes per game.<br/><br/>",

A Triominos fits if it is placed so at least one side is completely in contact with another, and all sides that stick together must match in color and figure.<br/>If you succeed in this, you will be rewarded with a counter.

The player with the most counters win.<br/><br/>Joker:<br/>(Using the joker is not advisable for the first playthroughs.)<br/>The joker counts as any figure or color and can be used anywhere a normal correct Triominos could be placed.<br/>You can replace a joker on the table, with another Triominos that fits the position. If you do so, you can add the joker to your rack, but will not earn a rewardtoken.<br/><br/>2nd level of play (aged 6 and upwards), to become more familiar with counting points:<br/>In this version of the rules, you play without the reward counters.<br/><br/>The only differences to the above rules are, that drawing Triominos does not cost you points, and points are counted as the total value of the figures on the Triominos you have placed. The score is then tracked throughout the game.

        "description": "The King is dead! Who will lead the Zeethvahs? According to Zeethvah tradition, every warrior is eligible to rule. The rules of succession are simple.... one year from this date, the warrior that has aquired the most riches or has performed the most heroic deeds will become OUR NEW LEADER!<br/><br/>The goal of the Snarf Quest Card Game is to take our hero Snarf through a grand adventure and acquire as much treasure as possible. Each player is making his own adventure for Snarf. At the end of the game, the player with the most treasure is declared to have the best Snarf adventure and becomes king of the Zeethvah village and WINS!<br/><br/>There are two basic departures from most card games. One, everyone draws from the same deck (known as the storydeck). Two, nobody ever holds cards in his hand. All cards are displayed where everyone can see them.<br/><br/>During each players turn, he controls Snarf (represented by the supplied miniature) and his actions. You must spend Action Points to move Snarf up and down the storyline (ten cards placed side by side next to the storydeck). As these storylines are activated, they are removed, the story line moves together and a replacement card is placed in the storyline next the the storydeck (the draw pile). Activated cards can help you or hurt your opponents, depending on what happens in the storyline. At the end of the game, the player with the most Treasure Points, Wins.<br/><br/>The basic game comes with 50 cards, a snarf miniature and is made for 2 to 3 players. However, with each additional 20 cards you add to your deck, one more player can be added. 5 is the recommended maximum. 20 card expansion sets can be purchased that also include a new miniature. Each of these expansions is based around a different character from the Snarf Quest comic strip. This is not a collectable card game, all starter and expansion decks are identical.<br/><br/>In 2003 the game was reproduced as a new version of the game which comes with a 100-card deck and one Snarf miniature. There are no expansions for this edition of the game.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Snarfquest Expansion 1 (Suthaze)<br/>    Snarfquest Expansion 2 (Telerie)<br/>    Snarfquest Expansion 3 (Aveeare)<br/>    Snarfquest Expansion 4 (Raffendorf)<br/>    Snarfquest Miniatures Bonus Pack<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player takes the part of a bad director attempting to make the worst B monster movie possible.  Movies are filmed by playing cards representing the seven main elements of a motion picture: Movie Title, Actor, Plot, Monster, Special Effects, Set Location, and Finale.  Each movie element card is rated in the industry standard &quot;star&quot; system where 1 star is very, very bad and 5 stars is Oscar quality.  Cards can be played either on yourself or your opponents, but there is one major hitch: every movie element is played face down and you can't look at any of them after they are in play, including the cards that you yourself played! Additional special cards add hilarity to hijinks.  Making a bad movie has never been so hard!<br/><br/>",

Shells numbered 1 through 10 are hidden in your command bunker with higher numbered shells having more firepower.  Players simultaneously select one of their ten shells then both players lower the bunker to reveal the value of the fired shell.  The player with the higher value shell totals the value of both shells and moves the slide that number of spaces towards his opponent.  If the shells are of the same value, both are discarded and the tanks are not moved.  If the opponents tanks are moved back over the land mines, the player that had the higher total can pull on the lanyard.  If the opponents tank is moved, it is destroyed and is out of the game.  Both of the fired shells are then removed from the game.  The game is played in two rounds but tanks destroyed in the first round are not replaced for the second round.

Units moving using the actual historical map features.<br/><br/>In February 1864, US Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick conceived a bold stroke against the Confederate capital, which local Union sympathizers had correctly reported as wide open to attack. The goals of the raid were to release the thousands of Union prisoners of war held in Libby Prison and on Belle Isle, as well as inflicting damage on key Rebel installations like the Tredegar Iron Works. Secret orders also authorized the killing of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and burning the city to the ground.<br/><br/>Historically, at the last minute, Kilpatrick lost his nerve and withdrew without firing a shot. The game begins at that point, but with the assumption the Union commander's nerve holds. As the Union raiders enter the city, it's a race against time as they seek to commandeer transport for the sick, wreak destruction across Richmond as slaves and panicked civilians fill the streets, and escape before Confederate army reinforcements begin pouring in from all directions.<br/><br/>",

These are revealed simultaneously and cross-referenced. A chart then shows you which page to turn to see  the results of the maneuvers. Players usually end up wounded or in a better position to strike a killing blow.<br/><br/>Warhammer Warriors is slightly more stream-lined than Lost Worlds and plays faster. Warhammer Warriors does not have &quot;behind you&quot; maneuvers and there is a lot more shooting/ranged combat. All characters have a Deathblow maneuver which speed up games if you're in a good position.<br/><br/>Kal Jerico is number #1 in the series.<br/><br/>",

They have convinced Bilbo to embark on a most unexpected journey &ndash; but first Gandalf, along with the Dwarves Dwalin, Kili and Fili, must find the other ten Dwarves who are lost in the Hobbit holes of Hobbiton.<br/><br/>In The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, the players first build the game out of LEGO bricks, then they take turns rolling a special six-sided die. If a player rolls 1-3, he moves his figure the number of spaces rolled and uses a torch to lift a piece out of the Hobbit hole on which he landed. Hopefully the bottom of the piece shows a Dwarf. If so, the player keeps the Dwarf and play passes to the left. If a player finds a Hobbit instead, he lifts a piece out of any other Hobbit hole on the board in an attempt to locate another Hobbit; if the player finds a match, he keeps the pair of Hobbits and is rewarded with the opportunity to peek at the bottom of a piece from any other Hobbit hole.<br/><br/>Instead of a Hobbit or Dwarf, some pieces feature a picture of breakfast. Matching two breakfasts allows a player to take a Dwarf piece already obtained by an opponent and return it to the Hobbit hole of his choice. The last possibility when revealing a piece is to find a picture of a rune. Matching two runes allows a player to select another Hobbit hole of his choice; if he finds a Dwarf in this location, he keeps it and play passes to the left. The custom die also features a picture of a map on one side. Rolling the map allows a player to move to any Hobbit hole on the board.<br/><br/>After all ten Dwarves have been found, the player with the most Dwarves wins. The game comes with variant rules, including one that shifts the location of Hobbit holes by swinging portions of the board into different configurations. Another variant requires players to find Thorin, the leader of the Dwarves, last. Another places Bilbo in one of the Hobbit holes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stworze is an adventure game set in slavic mythology, legends and folk tales. The game takes us on a journey across the Land, a world rich in lore and deities. Players assume the roles of eight mythical creatures (Stworze is an antiquated Polish word for creature, English counterpart could be ellen-g«£st), who will use their strength and artfulness in order to either help or harm people of the Land in everyday life. By fulfilling  unique quests they try to spread the influence towards the entire region. With every action Stworze will fight their way to dominion over the Land and its people.<br/><br/>The first Stworze to complete all missions from the unique quests deck becomes the winner. Each quest requires action, and each action demands operations on the board. Those actions expand the influence over the Land which helps us to become the only Guardian of the region.<br/><br/>As an action we can help or harm people, complete a quest or set rampaging crowd to a Stworze&rsquo;s lair. Completing an action brings you one step closer to the unavoidable events - eg. Dziady (Grandfathers) or Jare Gody (Slavic spring equinox festival).<br/><br/>The game offers two variants:<br/><br/>1. For beginners <br/>You create your missions deck according to the printed numbers on cards<br/><br/>2.For experienced players<br/>Recommended after playing at least one game and familiarising with all the components. A player creates the missions deck as they wish. Additionally, one chosen card is given to each of the opponents.<br/><br/>Update :<br/><br/>Stworze International edition (Essen Spiel 2018) :<br/><br/>- new Action: Duel<br/>- Rest action and Lair action become one<br/>- some minor differences<br/>- 10 miniatures in the box<br/><br/>",

The millionaire's lavish property must be sold off to satisfy his debts, and you are one of the creditors!  You may not need a diamond-encrusted watch or a rare fossil collection, but with 2-6 creditors sniffing around, maybe you should just take all that you can grab?!<br/><br/>Playing a round of Foreclosed! is simple, but the strategies are endless. Each turn, you'll be awarded a single item from Wealthy Uncle Moneybag's outrageous collection. If you receive some expensive silverware which you're not interested in collecting, and another player has received the fancy automobile you had your eye on, just make that player an offer.<br/><br/>If the other player wants to keep their item, they'll be forced to &quot;protect&quot; it by paying more money than you offered them. If a player does not have enough money, or does not want to spend the money they have, they must accept your offer. Once all players have had a chance to make offers, the round ends and all acquired items are added to their new owner's collection. Sometimes you will find it is just as rewarding to force other players to spend their money protecting items you didn't really want in the first place!<br/><br/>Foreclosed! lasts thirty minutes and can be played by 2-6 players.<br/><br/>For added depth and challenge to the game, Foreclosed! includes action cards for experienced players.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>Vasaran Alla  - peli ahneille neuvottelijoille.<br/><br/>Hyvin suosittu ja rikas filmit&auml;hti on tehnyt yll&auml;tt&auml;en henkil&ouml;kohtaisen vararikon!

The player who can endure the snakes, piranhas, bandits, tropical storms, and rival explorers to return safely to New York City with the statue is the winner.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to find or capture the priceless statue, El Dorado, in the South American Jungles and bring it back to New York. Along the way you will find treasures and spend your fortunes on crucial equipment and transportation.<br/><br/>There are three important regions on the board: The Northern part (Silver Zone) contains four hidden maps which will significantly aid you in your search for El Dorado. Deep within the Silver Zone lies the dark Amazon jungle, where fortunes are doubled but risks are also significantly increased. The third region is the Southern part of the continent (Gold Zone) where El Dorado waits for its finder.<br/><br/>Several ways exist to become the winner in this race which is known to turn friends into enemies. Fly to the Silver Zone to find one of the four maps, or risk everything by flying directly to the Gold Zone to immediately begin your search for El Dorado.<br/><br/>Watch out for bandits, snakes, spiders, piranha, tropical downpours, blowguns and rival players.<br/><br/>",

After the first roll the player must hold at least four dice. At the end of the second rolle the player must have at least six dice held. You score points by rolling the same number on your dice.  If you roll a pair of 2s, you get two points.  If you roll a pair of 6s, you get six points. For each additional die with the same number you score that number again. So, for three 6s you score twelve, six for the pair of 6s and six for the additional 6. Four 6s would score 18 and so on. There are also bonuses for all evens or odds, six or more dice of the same number or in sequence.<br/><br/>What makes the game unique is that it uses four different types of dice, each with a different highest number. For example, the game has two 10 sided dice and their highest number is 10. They are the only dice that can make a pair of ten. All dice have the numbers 1-4 on them, so it is much easier to get lower numbers.<br/><br/>Each turn players have to use strategy to determine which dice they&rsquo;ve rolled are the best to keep and the best to re-roll.  Do you chance it and try to roll another 8, or play it safe and hold a pair of 4s?  Figuring out the right move in a game with countless possibilities will keep you thinking, laughing and cheering for hours on end.<br/><br/>",

That's not the issue here &ndash; let the mice do what they want!<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls eight six-sided dice up to four times, keeping dice between rolls if desired. After finishing, she claims a number card if she's rolled that number on that many dice; e.g., if she's rolled a 4 on four dice, she claims the 4 card. After claiming a card, she either starts a new stack with that card as its base or places that card on top of another card she already has &ndash; but only if that card is lower than the top card of the stack.<br/><br/>If a player takes a 1 card, she can place it either glass case side up on top of a stack &ndash; closing that stack (since nothing can be placed on a 1) and protecting it from being stolen &ndash; or mouse side up; a mouse side-up 1 can later be placed on a stack, and a player can have only two of these cards. When a player closes a stack with four, five or six cards, she takes a bonus card from the table, with earlier claimed bonus cards being worth more points.<br/><br/>If a player can't take any cards, she takes a gift card, which she can spend on a later turn to rotate a die to show a particular face. A player can hold only one gift card.<br/><br/>When three of the number stacks are empty, the game ends immediately. The player with the most stacks claims a 12-point bonus card, then players tally their points. Each closed stack is worth the product of the largest number in the stack and the number of cards in the stack; each open stack is worth the sum of the cards in the stack.

Each player with a token then says how many of the depicted item are shown on the cards in the central pile. Whoever is correct (or closest) wins the harvest card. The stack is cleared, then the game continues. Whoever collects the most harvest cards wins.<br/><br/>In the second game, each player has two harvest cards face-up before him and a deck of windfall cards. Now players are trying to slap the deck when any of the three items appears at least 11 times in the pile. If the slapper is correct, he wins a harvest card; if not, he loses one of those in front of him. Again, the player with the most harvest cards wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Red Code instructions.<br/><br/>1.0.<br/><br/>Welcome to Red Code, a board game where you take control of a WWII military ship. Re-live epic battles with your family and friends. Manage your crew to carry out manoeuvres with your ship, attack the other players&rsquo; ships and co-operate with players in your faction to achieve victory.<br/><br/>1.1. Characteristics:<br/>The players play 1 on 1, or combine into 2 factions of 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3. The game takes about 45 minutes and is for players over 8 years old.<br/><br/>1.2. Prologue:<br/>The game combines simple mechanics, the placement of crew, to choose different manoeuvres. Take advantage of the possibilities offered by the terrain and your boat to sink the enemy.<br/><br/>2.0. Objective of the game:<br/><br/>2.1. Arena mode<br/><br/>The first group to sink the enemy ships is the winner. You don&rsquo;t use the score card for this mode, as the sinking of all the enemy&rsquo;s ships implies that the enemy player has been eliminated.<br/><br/>(Games of 2 vs 2) The first side to lose a ship receives 2 order cards. There is no effect for ships sunk after that.<br/><br/>(Games of 3 vs 3) The first side to lost 2 ships receives 2 order cards between the players of that side. In other words the first team to be reduced to just 1 ship will receive 2 order cards. There is no effect when other teams are reduced to 1 ship later.<br/><br/>2.2. War mode<br/><br/>The first side to get 5 victory points is the winner. Sinking an enemy ship earns you 1 victory point. This is shown by advancing your score token on the score card by 1 position.<br/><br/>When a ship is sunk, it is returned to the beginning map card and flipped over to show that it will miss the next turn. When the ship is restored after being sunk, it is fully restored (crew, repairs and breakdowns) and you can choose any one of the available spaces on the beginning card to place it in.<br/><br/>A player who sinks a ship receives an order card.<br/><br/>3.0. Contents:<br/><br/>15 map cards<br/>30 order cards<br/>3 blue control cards<br/>3 red control cards<br/>1 scorecard<br/>18 red cubes<br/>18 yellow cube<br/>36 white cubes<br/>6 ship pieces<br/>2 score tokens<br/><br/>3.1. Map cards:<br/><br/>The map cards are divided into 4 boxes, which each count as one space for movement. Only 1 ship can occupy a box.<br/><br/>Islands: These are impassable, so ships can not move over them, and they block line-of-sight for firing.<br/><br/>Running water: When a ship enters this box, it automatically receives +1 movement which must be used to move to a neighbouring box. If that neighbouring box also has running water, the ship gains another +1 movement, and so on.<br/><br/>3.2. Control cards<br/><br/>There are 3 kinds of ship in Red Code: Submarine; Destroyer; Aircraft carrier. These have some similar manoeuvres, but also some manoeuvres which are unique to that kind.<br/><br/>On the control card, yellow cubes (repairs) and red cubes (breakdowns) are used to show the state of the ship. Once both of these characteristics have been reduced to 0, the ship is sunk. During the game, any damage taken by the ship reduces the amount of repairs. When the number of repairs hits 0, remove a breakdown token and put 3 repair tokens back on the control card (1 breakdown = 3 repairs). You are not allowed to exceed the amount of breakdown and repair spaces available on the control card.<br/><br/>Another area of the control card shows what your crew (white cubes) are doing, and this is used to manage the different manoeuvres. At the start, all ships have 6 crew, placed on the crew area on the control card. The control cards each have 4 common manoeuvre boxes and 4 unique manoeuvre boxes.<br/><br/>Crew: These are used to pay the cost of your ship&rsquo;s manoeuvres. You use up your crew during the battle, but also recover crew each turn during the battle. [Representing the energy of your crew, rather than individual crew members] The crew are the engine of this game, and so good management of your crew is what makes your ship more lethal.<br/><br/>Manoeuvres: You must choose appropriate attack or defence actions at particular points to manage your ship effectively. Manoeuvres with a crew member already on the square can not be used during that turn.<br/><br/>&bull;    Movement: Move one square. Can not be responded to.<br/>    &bull;    Repair: Regain 1 repair cube.<br/>    &bull;    Torpedo: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces.<br/>    &bull;    Orders: Draw one order card. Can not be responded to.<br/>    &bull;    Immersion: Move two squares. Can not be responded to.<br/>    &bull;    Countermeasure: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum of 2 spaces, and you regain 1 repair cube.<br/>    &bull;    Heavy torpedo: Does 2 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.<br/>    &bull;    Floating mine: Does 2 repair damage plus 1 crew damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.<br/>    &bull;    Missile: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces. Can not be responded to.<br/>    &bull;    Depth charge: Does 2 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.<br/>    &bull;    Shield: Cancels the current manoeuvre, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.<br/>    &bull;    Assault: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 1 space.<br/>    &bull;    Air support: Does 1 repair damage, at a maximum distance of 3 spaces.<br/>    &bull;    Radio support: Regain 1 repair cube at a maximum distance of 2 spaces. Can not be responded to.<br/>    &bull;    Medical equipment: Regain 1 breakdown cube, at a maximum distance of 2 spaces.<br/>    &bull;    Radar: Does 1 repair damage plus 1 crew damage at a maximum distances of 3 spaces. Can not be responded to.<br/><br/>Available manoeuvres: Manoeuvres that do not have any crew on their squares are available to be used. The players can only use these manoeuvres on their turn and can only use the manoeuvres on their ship, except for the response manoeuvres. Manoeuvres that can be used as responses are marked in yellow on the control card and can be used both on your turn and the other players&rsquo; turns. Note that the manoeuvre selected must be available to use - it must not have any crew on it. And responses can only be made when the player whose turn it is has executed a manoeuvre that allows responses.<br/><br/>For example: The counter measure manoeuvre has a distance of two, and can repair 1 damage and do 1 damage.<br/><br/>Visual field: This shows what your ship can see and where it can carry out actions. It includes the boxes in a straight line horizontally, vertically and diagonally from your ship and depends on the distance that the specific manoeuvre you want to use has. For example: If an manoeuvre has no distance, you can only carry it out on yourself, but if a manoeuvre has a distance of 2, then it can be used on any ship that distance or less (horizontally, vertically or diagonally only) including your own ship. [In the example picture, the red destroyer can target the blue submarine but can not target the blue destroyer.]<br/><br/>Note that the enemy ships have the same effect as islands in blocking your line of sight.<br/><br/>3.3. Order cards.<br/><br/>These provide certain advantages in the game, providing bonuses, hurting the enemy or modifying the characteristics of the ship (movement, repairs, manoeuvres, etc.). Only 1 order card can be used per turn, but the effects can be used on any target on the table, regardless of distance or objects blocking line of sight. In other words, order cards are not affected by the visual field. In addition, order cards will always be executed and offer no chance for the enemy to respond. Each player may not have more than 3 order cards in their hand at any time.<br/><br/>&bull;    Ambush: The target ship loses 2 repair.<br/>    &bull;    Deserter: The target ship loses 1 crew from the reserve. This crew member can be recovered in the crew recovery phase.<br/>    &bull;    Boatswain: The target ship recovers 2 crew.<br/>    &bull;    Atomic bomb: 2 repair damage to all ships in a 2 by 2 square (4 spaces in total).<br/>    &bull;    Evasion: The target ship gains +3 movement.<br/>    &bull;    Captain: 1 repair damage to the target ship, and then you draw 1 order card.<br/>    &bull;    Mechanic: The target ship gains 2 repair.<br/>    &bull;    Intercept: 1 repair damage to the target ship, and can not carry out any manoeuvres until their next turn. This means that the target ship will not be able to respond to any manoeuvres until its next turn.<br/>    &bull;    Kamikaze: 1 breakdown damage to the target ship (remember, 1 breakdown equals 3 repairs).<br/><br/>4.0. Beginning of the game<br/><br/>4.1. Preparation of the table:<br/><br/>Shuffle the map cards and place face up a 3 by 4 formation (see example picture). The 3 cards left over are not used in the game.<br/><br/>4.2. Preparation of the ships:<br/><br/>The players are divided 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2 or 3 vs 3, depending on the number of players. Next, each player selects a ship from the 3 available, and also takes the corresponding control card. Each player fills up that control card with the red and yellow cubes (repairs and breakdowns) indicated on the control card, plus 6 crew members.<br/><br/>The two teams have a starting card in opposite corners of the board, and the team members put their ships into one of the 4 squares in their starting card.<br/><br/>4.3. Start the game.<br/><br/>Shuffle the order cards and deal out one initial order card to each player. Place the remaining deck of order cards in a pile face-down next to the board.<br/><br/>5.0. Turn phases<br/><br/>5.1. Recover crew<br/><br/>At the start of your turn, you always replace 2 crew into your reserve, either from the manoeuvre spaces or from the pile of withdrawn crew (see the radar and floating mine manoeuvres and the deserter order card).<br/><br/>You choose where to recover the crew from depending on what manoeuvres are needed for your next turn.<br/><br/>5.2. Management of manoeuvres<br/><br/>You use the manoeuvres available to your ship to try to sink the enemy. The manoeuvres cost crew to carry out the action (according to the number of boxes for that manoeuvre), but also depend on the line of vision of the ship. The target must be within the action&rsquo;s range and on a straight line either vertically, horizontally or diagonally.<br/><br/>5.3. Possible responses:<br/><br/>Responses are manoeuvres but can be used in your turn or the turn of another player. For example: Immersion can not be used as a response, but torpedo can be used as a response. The last manoeuvre declared is the first to be carried out. For example, if a player launches an action in front of an enemy and they launch a response which the initial player then responds too, then the response of the first player is completed, then the response of the opponent, and finally the initial manoeuvre. If in the middle of this chain of events a ship is sunk, further manoeuvres in the chain targeting that ship will be wasted but the manoeuvres will still be treated as spent, which means that the crew spent on the manoeuvres will remain spent and the manoeuvres will be unavailable.<br/><br/>",

Everybody will immediately try to find a suitable word. When enough words have been found will Meggie, the heroine of the story, move towards goal; if not will Capricorn move forwards. Only if Meggie manage to reach goal first will the gamers win the game!<br/><br/>The game is based upon the highly succesful children's book &quot;Inkheart&quot; by Cornelia Funke. The novel is about the power of the word, and game designer Klaus Teuber of &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot; fame have captured the enthralling and tantalizing atmosphere of the struggle of young Meggy and her father Moe on one side against the evil Capricorn and his henchmen on the other.<br/><br/>Moe has the fantastic ability to read characters out of a story and into life. By this he brought Capricorn, the super-villain, into our world, who strifes to get all of his evil henchmen out of his book to help him with his bad deeds. But for this, he requires Moes services...<br/><br/>The trilogy has captivated children all over the world, and a major movie was released in March 2008.<br/>So hopefully will we soon see an English language edition of this game.<br/><br/>This is a game in the Kosmos line of literature-based games.<br/><br/>",

The reader (who puts a Michael Feldman bobblehead in front of them) cannot score that round. The outrageous questions are multiple choice (A,B or C) and are based on general knowledge and opinion polls.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>Players to either side of the reader are the 2 contestants; the rest are the audience. Audience members choose and reveal their answers and then try to convince both contestants to vote for their answer. (They'll get points for their persuasive powers, even if it's the wrong answer.) After discussion and debating, the contestants vote for their answers and scoring chips are awarded.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>Anyone with the right answer to the question gets a chip. If both contestants choose the correct answer, they and everyone else with the right answer get an extra bonus chip. If both contestants choose wrong, they get no chips, but any audience member who chose the same wrong answer as both contestants gets a chip for successfully influencing them. The bobblehead is passed to the left and the new reader asks the next question. Play proceeds until someone wins the required number of chips (10-16, depending on the number of players).<br/><br/>",

As long as any player still wants cards, gems are added to a pile. The round ends only when no one wants to take any more cards.

        "description": "Inverted Dice is a challenging tactic dice game for smart adults and curious children. The game introduces a new way to look at dice rolls &ndash; a way to regard five normal six-sided dice as one big twenty-sided die (with some odd probability properties). Normally, you would throw some dice and use the sum of the numbers being shown. In this game, you use the sum of the numbers not being shown:<br/><br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/>\t\t<br/><br/>Such a sum is called an inverted dice sum. <br/> You need five dice to play. The structure of the game is a bit like the one in Yahtzee, with a similar score chart and three rolls (or fewer) per turn.<br/> There are twenty rounds in the game. In each round, players take turns rolling five dice, trying to reach one of the inverted sums 1 to 20 (it has to be a number that the player has not previously achieved or zeroed out).<br/> After each inverted dice roll, the player chooses which dice to keep, and which to reroll. A player may reroll some or all of the dice up to two times on a turn, making a maximum of three rolls each turn.<br/> If a player achieves an available result, it is registered in the score chart.<br/> If the player fails (after three rolls), a number must be recorded as zero points.<br/> Every player must put either a score or a zero into a score box each turn.<br/> The game ends when all score boxes are used. The player with the highest total score wins the game.<br/><br/>Players can receive maximum three bonuses by achieving all scores in one or more bonus sections.<br/><br/>",

However, as is typical in romantic comedy anime, your characters might fall in love, usually unreciprocated, and will then ignore your orders to instead follow their love around the board.<br/><br/>Each turn in the game has 9 phases, most of which are brief.<br/>1) Initiative - Figure out turn order, based on player strength.<br/>2) Libido - All characters gain Libido, which they can use to move and fight.<br/>3) Voluntary Movement - players move their characters, then 4) Automatic Movement - characters may be dragged towards a Love Interest or Rival.<br/>5) Love - Characters may fall in love based on the Looks and Gender of other characters in that city.<br/>6) Combat - Characters in cities fight, gaining Notoriety for the player.<br/>7) Domination - Players can try to use any characters still conscious to Dominate cities, spending Notoriety Points to better their chances.<br/>8) Firing &amp; Recruitment - Players can fire characters and recruit new characters, spending Notoriety Points to do so.<br/>9) Mutual Love - Characters in love with each other and alone together in a city lose all of their libido.

Road warriors rule the highways in souped-up vehicles decked out with guns, armor, and turbo-charged engines. The best of these gasoline gladiators have come together to compete in the arena of death. The winner is awarded fuel for a year, water for a month, and the glory of the kill. The losers are wreckage.<br/><br/>In Wreckage, each player controls one of eight different vehicles and equips it with weapons, armor, and other equipment of his choice. By playing cards from their vehicles' steering decks, the players drive their vehicles around the play area, collecting gas and blowing each other's cars to scrap metal.<br/><br/>Wreckage is a fast-paced game of turbo-charged mayhem for 2-4 players ages 10 and up, and can be played in 20-60 minutes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is a game where everyone simultaneously plays a unique number face down card a la Take 5 (6 Nimmt).<br/><br/>There are 5 suits arranged in a circular pattern. The idea is you score the points based on the first person to hit their number traveling clockwise after the current number, e.g. if the colors are Green, Blue, Red, Yellow, Orange, Green, Blue, etc. and the current target card is Orange 6, then the first number after orange 6 wins a number of points equal to the interval. For example, orange 7 would win 1 point, but if it were not there and Green 1 were next closest, it would win 5 points. If the next closest card were orange 5 (unlikely but possible), it would score 49 points.<br/><br/>Each player also always has in hand a Shit! card which cannot score, but playing it is the only way to get another card in hand. Strategy comes from watching when people play cards and how many they have left. Time it right and you can play while everyone else is drawing for monster points.<br/><br/>It's a fun 20 minutes. The rules are in English.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Autobridge is a bridge teaching and solitaire playing device and series of play sheets dating back to at least 1938 (according to Encarta). At least two major versions have been produced. A large sized version about 18x11 inches and smaller version about 8x6 inches. While the specific materials and details of design have varied over the years, the fundamental design has remained. It is a board which may be opened to insert a sheet with cards indices and suits printed on it. The covering board is closed and the hand is played by opening windows. The player decides on their own play and reveals the next window to see what the expert recommends. An accompanying booklet explains the expert's recommendation.<br/><br/>The system can be used to teach the completely naive novice to highly advanced players. Many supplementary sheets were produced over the decades.<br/><br/>Mainly a teaching aide, there is no scoring, per se.<br/><br/>Experts who have contributed to the Autobridge system include: Ely and Josephine Culbertson, Charles Goren, Alfred Sheinwold, Alan Truscott, Barry Rigal, Albert Morehead, and Richard Frey.<br/><br/>Most versions found in online auctions appear to date from the 1950s.<br/><br/>",

Later Joker (BRIO's board game division) would re-release the game in the early 1980's, followed by Alga in around 1985 (when Alga had been purchased by BRIO and replaced Joker as the companys board game arm.) It is now out-of-print.<br/><br/>The game is played in three stages. In the first stage you have to take the map pieces from the other players.<br/><br/>Second stage: When you have all the pieces, you know where the treasure is located (since you would know which part Captain Kidd has swallowed = missing) and you can rush away to the hidden place to get the treasure chest.<br/><br/>In the third and last stage, you have to run away, either with the raft or with one of the rowing boats the player arrived with. All the time the other player can get the map pieces or the chest from you, so you need to be quick and careful.<br/><br/>Of course the pirates may duel with pistols and shoot with the cannon - placed in the centre of the island - at each other!<br/><br/>The game were sold with fine metal (tin) playing pieces: six pirates, a raft, a cannon and, of course, the treasure chest (fitted with a steel ring so it could be hung on the pirate playing piece representing who had custody of the treasure!).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Espionage game where players must steal the diplomatic bag of any one opponent and return it to their own headquarters to win; a 'capture the bag' game you might say.<br/><br/>Players start on the outer track of the board where they move around gathering pieces of equipment (ladder, revolver, dagger, earphones, passport, wire-cutters) needed for the bag-capture 'mission'. As each piece is obtained, it is placed near the player's HQ on the inner part of the board. Once five pieces of equipment have been so placed, the mission can begin.<br/><br/>The mission takes place on the inner part of the board. Here, each player has a home territory of 5x5 squares and these areas are separated from one another by a wall or fence. On his turn, the player rolls a special die and uses it to move his equipment pieces toward an enemy HQ. The barriers can be breached by moving a ladder or wire-cutter onto them, or alternatively the passport piece can be moved onto the central checkpoint square to allow other pieces to pass through here. Each type of equipment has a point value (gun = 6, dagger =5, etc). When two opposing pieces occupy the same square, the one with the lower value is removed (both are removed if they are of equal value). Players cannot continue missions with fewer than five pieces of equipment and are forced to return to the outer board to acquire replacements before continuing. If a player manages to land a piece onto an opposing diplomatic bag, it is captured and he can start to move both pieces back towards his own HQ as a single unit.<br/><br/>While moving on both the inner and outer board, the player may have to draw a chance card of some sort, and this is where the game's chief gimmick comes into play and from where it takes its name. These cards all have the word 'Microdot' on them, written in dots. One of these dots contains a very small number or letter and the included plastic magnifying glass is supposed to be used to read it (but this is not really necessary). The letter/number is then referenced on the relevant 'decode' chart and the instructions followed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A self-contained spin-off of the Star Trek Customizable Card Game from Decipher, Tribbles is a fairly straightforward card game where you are trying to empty your 7 card hand in order to score points (&quot;tribbles&quot;) that you have been able to play. Each card represents a certain quantity of &quot;tribbles&quot; (1, 10, 1000, or 10,000.) The game play follows a sequential order, with each player needing to play the next higher value of tribble out of his hand than the one played immediately before.  If no such card is held, the player must pass and draw a card from his personal deck. There are also optional effects on each card, some reminiscent of Uno (among them Skip and Reverse), that vary the play sequence, score some special points, or allow a player to discard a card. A round ends when either a player is out of hand cards or all but one of the players are out of cards in their deck. Only the player who goes out scores points for his Tribbles played that round. Five rounds make a game. The player who scores the most tribbles in those five rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>The game provides four pre-constructed decks totaling 112 cards, which are color coded to fit a theme. These cards can be interchanged to create different decks. To make the game even more customizable, &quot;tribbles&quot; cards from the ST:CCG expansion set &quot;The Trouble With Tribbles&quot; are compatible with this game. These cards can increase the highest tribbles card to 100,000, plus add a new special ability (a bonus for collecting a specific set of cards) and different combinations than those included in the boxed set.<br/><br/>Also included in the game are reference cards which list the makeup of each standard deck and explain what the special effects are. In addition, you get a scoresheet and even a small pencil.<br/><br/>",

You compete as one of 7 real medal winning decathletes:  Jim Thorpe, Bob Matthias, Vasily Kuznetsov, Milt Campbell, Rafer Johnson, CK Yang, Bill Toomey.  A fictional 8th player is a composite althete composed of the best performance of each event from these 7 athletes.<br/><br/>Each event is simulated by rolling 3 special dice to generate a number which is used to read a result on a table for each althete.  Some events allow a choice of trying an average attempt, a safe attempt, or going all out (which increase the risks of fouling or injuries).  In events like the high jump and pole vault, the more attempts made the greater chance of fatigue.  Injuries and fatigue affect the results of later events.<br/><br/>Each event is converted to the standard scoring table for the decathlon.<br/><br/>Also known as Track Meet.<br/><br/>",

Basic and Advanced variants allow 2 to 4 players, with up to 8 in a variant for children.<br/><br/>Each player has two ships on a square grid board. The number of moves a ship may make is based on the direction the ship is traveling relative to the wind. Moves can consist of advancing forward one square or turning 90 degrees. Wind changes randomly every time a three minute timer expires before a player's turn.<br/><br/>Each ship begins the game with three magnetic prize disks representing the ship's strength. Ships may fire when their broadside is facing an adjacent or nearby enemy ship. The number of dice rolled depends on each ship's strength (i.e. the number of prize disks). If the attacker's top roll is higher than the defender's top roll, the defender is deprived of a prize disk.<br/><br/>Prize disks can be recovered by spending repair cards. Each player starts with a fixed number of repair cards and they are never refilled. Optional advanced rules include the drawing of random effects cards on each attack, attacking enemy repair ports, boarding damaged ships, mists that provide sanctuary from attack, and ramming.<br/><br/>",

The structure of Kit &amp; Caboodle draws on the complexities of probability, set theory, the riddle of evolution, and the psychology of perception.&quot;<br/><br/>Actually, it is a dice game very similar in gameplay to Yahtzee or Kismet. Players have six dice, and roll any or all dice one, two or three times attempting to obtain dice combinations fitting a scoring category. Players fill scoring boxes and add them for a total score. The player with the highest total score wins the game.<br/><br/>Instead of number combinations, though, you are mixing and matching animals and their characteristics (plus a moon and and planet!). For each turn you must fill in a category on the scorepad. So there are decisions such as whether to use a bird for a Bird Caboodle, a Wings Kit, or a Shells Kit.<br/><br/>Not all seventeen figures are on all the dice, as they are six-sided, so you must keep in mind that some rolls would not work, ever. Also figures aren't represented equally but are merely an assortment. For example, there are 4 birds, all green; there are 2 &quot;boo&quot; but only one of all the other purple letters, 3 moons, 2 green planets, and 2 pterosaurs (one of each color).<br/><br/>",

Playing time 40 - 180+ mins depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>The game Cat Attack is based on the trials and tribulations of the domestic cat. The board represents a local neighborhood. Each player is a (model) cat that lives in its own house. To win the game a cat must fill its larder with six items of food. There is milk at the Dairy, vitamins at the Vet, fish from the Fishmonger and a tin of cat food from the corner shop. There are also (model) birds and mice, which the cats have to catch. Of course, each cat begins the game with nine lives; any cat that loses all of its nine lives is out of the game. Players are dealt a hand of Mog cards; these and a die provide the means to move the cats, birds and mice. The players can choose to move their cats along garden walls or paths or, the more adventurous can travel round the road, this route is a lot quicker but there is a car. Cats can raid other cats larders and attack one another. A pack of Curiosity cards dictate, at random, when the shops open and close and movements of the (model) car. A Curiosity card is picked up when a cat lands on a Curiosity square. Some of these cards are good news but you know what happened to the curious cat!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scabs &lsquo;N&rsquo; Guts Board Game is a totally new and exciting &quot;meducational&quot; board game that's packed with interesting and occasionally disgusting medical facts about how your body works. Players or teams take turns to move around the fun and factual body-shaped game board while attempting to correctly answer the multiple choice questions from one of three unique body categories: Scrapes and Scabs, Blood and Guts or Blubber or Buff. When a player or a team correctly answers one question from each of the three categories, they pick up a random question card and have the chance to win the game if they answer correctly. As players move around the body, make sure to keep an eye out for Miracle Cure and Strong Immunity cards that can improve your health and help you win the game. But watch out for the Accidents Happens and Couch Potato cards that could make you ill and slow you down. Scabs &lsquo;N&rsquo; Guts, it&rsquo;s just what the doctor ordered. For 2 or more players.<br/><br/>",

Each player is given 60 seconds to draw a shape with a loop of string, move it around, and interact with it, trying to help other players guess that word, then as many other words as possible in the time allotted.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they draw the top card of the deck, with each card showing four numbered objects or phrases; the top card of the deck will show 1-4 numbers, and those numbers indicate which objects the drawer can choose to depict with the string.<br/><br/>When the drawer is ready, they flip the sand timer, grab the string, and start &quot;drawing&quot; &mdash; but they can interact with that drawing to help others guess the object, such as strumming a guitar, moving the tentacles on an octopus, or twirling the rotors on a helicopter. The drawer can't make any noise, and part of the string has to remain touching the table while they animate their drawing. Otherwise, the drawer can get crazy with it.<br/><br/>The other players call out their ideas, and when a player guesses the word correctly, they receive the card, then the drawer quickly moves on to their next drawing. When time is up, the drawer scores 1 point for each word that was guessed correctly, and each player scores 1 point for each correct guess they made.<br/> The game contains three types of challenge words that are harder to draw, but worth 2 points if guessed:<br/><br/><br/>    2-Player: Make the drawing in the air with another player.<br/>    Don't Look: Draw with your eyes closed.<br/>    Forbidden Word: Guessing a certain word costs a card.<br/><br/><br/>After everyone has had two turns as the drawer (or one turn in a game with seven or more players), the game ends, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

If there are four players then the game will be played with four complete sets (for example 4 jacks, 4 kings, 4 queens and 4 aces), when playing with 5 players the game will be played with 5 complete sets, when playing with 6, 6 complete sets will be used and so on.<br/><br/>Before a round starts the cards are shuffled and all the players receive four cards that they will hold in their hands and keep them secretly. Then every turn each player will simultaneous pass a card to the person on the left.<br/><br/>When someone has a complete set in his hands, he gives a not too obvious signal for example constantly blinking an eye or shaking his head. (From that point on the player with the complete set must pass on the card he receives in the same turn to the left in order to keep his set complete.) All the players have to copy the secret symbol. The last person to react looses the round and receives a letter.<br/><br/>The first time you loose a round you get the letter E, the second time a Z, the the third time another E and the fourth time a L. You are the EZEL (donkey) and you loose the game.<br/><br/>The game can also be played as a drinking game where the loser of a round has to drink.<br/><br/>",

Only those who choose wisely and collect the right combination of crew mates will have a chance to outmaneuver their enemies. You should not shy away from stealing your rival captain's crew or treasure points and gaining the upper hand while hiring crew members. Only the captain who is clever and combines cards with foresight will set sail as one of the most infamous of pirates. Once you have hired your crew it's time to say &quot;All Hands On Deck&quot; and you are ready to gather valuable treasure points.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>Each player has got a deck of cards in front of him or her, but during the game players can draw from any deck. At the beginning of a turn players each draw 3 cards without looking at them. Then a player counts down from 3 and all players start looking at their hand, then putting one card aside and the rest on the deck in front of them. The first player to do so is going to be the next first player and will start drawing cards at the beginning of the next turn. The card you have put aside is your hidden crew. As soon as you have got a combination of 2 or more cards in your hidden crew you can shout &quot;All Hands On Deck&quot; and play one set of cards for an effect and the treasure points they are worth. Afterwards the next turn starts with the new first player.<br/>When all cards are gone, the game is over and the pirate with the most treasure points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Players have to make a stack 15 chips, while not spending more than a set amount of Clout on the stack. Players take turns throwing the chips into the play area, and depending on how they hit the table, the individual effects of each chip occur. Chips have stats, abilities, and powers that affect game play. Some of the powers and abilities include protection, poison, weaken, and the strengthening of other chips within a radius of where the chip lands. After the chips land on the table, players can decide to attack other player's chips. Further chip effects can come into play in these situations. For example, chips with the Taunt ability force attacking chips to attack them before any other chips. Chips are eliminated from the play area as play continues. After throwing and playing out all their chips, players count all their Clout still in the play area plus extra points for proximity to other chips. Whoever has the most Clout points wins.<br/><br/>Some chips are common, while others are unique, adding to the collectability factor. In addition, there are various &quot;types&quot; of chips including effects, characters, and bases, to name just a few. Where chips land on the table and how players throw will have a significant effect on how the game will play out. The chips are approximately the same weight and style as casino poker chips, not cardboard. Physical skill will be a factor in game play, so gamers can start practicing their chip tossing now with the poker chips they already own.<br/><br/>This is the first set in the Clout series of games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SUMMARY:<br/>The Fruit Ninja Card Game is based on the popular Fruit Ninja video game popularized on the iOS and Andriod mobile platforms.  In the video game, fruit (and bombs) are tossed into the air and the player makes gestures to slice as much fruit with their sword as possible while avoiding bombs.<br/>The Fruit Ninja Card Game is a very simple push your luck card game that makes thematic use of simply cutting the deck of cards.  By cutting the deck and selecting cards based on the risk associated with the color coded card backs, players attempt to be the first to either collect one of each of the 7 types of fruit or collect 25 pieces of the same type of fruit.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>After shuffling the deck of cards, the starting player cuts the deck while making the sound of someone making a sword chop.  That player chooses either the top card from the bottom section of the deck or the bottom card from the top section of the deck (a choice between the two inner cards of the split deck). By looking at the color of the card backs, the player can asses the risk of choosing a particular card.  Some cards have a higher risk of being a bomb while having the potential to contain more pieces of fruit.  The player continues their turn as long as they avoid choosing a bomb card.  As long as the player only finds fruit cards, they continue adding up fruit and splitting the top section of the deck remaining from their previous split.  If the player chooses to stop, they get to keep their fruit cards and pass the deck to the next player.  If at some point the player chooses to cut the deck and chooses a bomb card, they end their turn and loose any fruit that they have revealed during that turn (while keeping fruit earned on previous turns).  Three types of power bananas can be played from a players saved stash of fruit to perform one of the following actions based on the type of fruit: steal a fruit, ignore a bomb or take an additional turn.  While very simple, this card game remains thematically true to the simple video game that it is based on.<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/>103 Fruit Ninja Cards + 1 sheet of rules in English<br/><br/>FROM THE BOX:<br/>Based on the hit game.  Make Sensei proud!  Cut the deck--select the top or the bottom.  The first player to collect one of each fruit or 25 of any fruit wins!  The colors on the card backs will help you choose.  Be wary! Bombs end your turn and you forfeit this turns bounty.  Power bananas grant special ninja powers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Stumped adds a huge twist to the traditional deck-building game: buildable miniature wooden trees. Your objective is simple: successfully grow a 10 leaf tree before your opponents do. But actually doing this can get a bit tricky, with a huge variety of 165 different cards, ranging from some downright nasty attack cards, to more growth-focused and defensive cards (scroll down to see all of them). Every game has a fresh set of challenges, opportunities, and strategies. You might try and truncate your trainee's tree, or you might just end up Stumped.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The fast flowing game play is perfect for casual and serious gamers ages 12 and up!<br/><br/>Each player selects a color for their tokens, and then places their Victory tokens and Royal Support tokens on the map. They also gather their Colony tokens in front of them in preparation for conquest! Set-up concludes with each player receiving their starting cards.<br/><br/>During your turn, you get to play those cards.<br/><br/>Cards can be played for their text. There are two types of cards: Action cards are tan, and you play them during your turn. Reaction cards are red and are played in reaction to other players' playing cards. Each player, on their turn, can play as many Action cards as they are able to.<br/><br/>Every card can also be played to perform one of several basic actions. A card can be played to do any of the following: build a colony, reduce a colony, repair a colony, or adjust Royal Support.<br/><br/>Once you have finished playing cards, you get to tally up your points for the turn. You receive one point for each successful colony you have on the map, and a bonus of two more victory points for each of your export or regional monopolies!<br/><br/>Each of the other players then takes a turn. Once everyone has had a turn, advance the Time Counter.<br/><br/>The game ends when you move the Turn token into the Game Over square. The winner of the game is the player with the most Victory Points!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Cultists of Cthulhu, you play as a student or professor at Miskatonic University, working with your friends to investigate the horrors invading your school. Unbeknownst to the rest of you, one of your friends is secretly a Cultist, eager to sacrifice the rest of you to their dark master.<br/><br/>The Academics must work together to accomplish the goals of the scenario before the stars align and the Cultist is able to pull off their scheme, reveal themselves, and summon a Shoggoth, a flight of Night Gaunts, or reveal themselves to have been a Mi-Go the whole time, to pick three example Cultists from a single scenario, the Fungi from Yuggoth.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds, consisting of each player taking a turn, and then one University Phase. On a turn, a player draws an Event card related to their location, resolves it using a push-your-luck ability check mechanic which forces them to make trade offs between personal harm or harm to the group, and then takes two Actions: Move, Fight, Search, Steal, Trade, Use an Item, or a Scenario specific event. The University Phase consist of moving any monsters that may be on the board, followed by the starting player drawing two University cards, selecting one to play and one to shuffle back into the deck without revealing. These cards are all bad for the Academics, but in different ways and to different degrees, so this is another opportunity for the Cultist to secretly advance their own agenda. The starting player then passes the Starting Player token to their left and a new round begins.<br/><br/>The Academic players are trying to complete their Scenario specific goals before the Cultist kills them. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth scenario, the Academic goals are: A1: assemble a complete Elder Sign, A2: take it to Chapel, B1: find the Necronomicon in the Vault or Library, B2: use it as described on its card. Players gain Elder Sign pieces by successfully completing Events, by searching, or by making them in the Art Department with a Finesse check. Players look for the Necronomicon in the Library with Reason checks, or the Vault with Focus checks. Events also have a chance of advancing the Star Chartz The Academics win if they complete their goals before the last of them is killed, the Cultist wins if they kill all of the Academics. When the Star Chart reaches a certain number, the Cultist may reveal themselves to gain some horrid benefit. For instance, in the Fungi from Yuggoth, all players know that the Cultist is trying to get the Star Chart to either 15 so they can reveal themselves to be a Mi-Go in a human costume, or 20 so they can summon a trio of Night Gaunts, or 25 so they can summon a Shoggoth. All players know these are the options, but only the Cultist knows which one they are actually trying to do.<br/><br/>Cultists of Cthulhu is a big-box, semicooperative, thematic game of mystery, investigation, teamwork, and betrayal. The board is modular, and assembled at the beginning of each game in a rapid-fire, real-time setup. With this very fast, unique map setup, 12 characters, 4 different scenarios, each with multiple possible hidden Cultist goals, Cultists of Cthulhu provides near infinite diversity and replayability.<br/><br/>Featuring an ability check mechanism using custom dice which allows for meaningful decisions every turn, an innovative combat system, dark, suspenseful art, and gripping theme music, Cultists of Cthulhu has been called &quot;possibly the next Arkham Horror.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Instead of a 9x9 grid, players will now play onto a 4x4 grid, with 16 victory cards comprising the spaces of that grid. Frame cards surround this grid to label the rows (A-D), columns (1-4) and 2x2 regions (labeled with card suits).<br/><br/>On a turn, a player plays a &quot;hand&quot; card that specifies a row, column or 2x2 region and claims one victory card in the appropriate location. (Alternatively, a player can use a kicker card as a joker.) Each time you claim a victory card after the first one, the card must match the color or shape on the victory card that you claimed the previous turn. Once all players pass, the round ends and empty spaces on the board are refilled with victory cards. When the victory card deck is exhausted, the game ends and the player with the most victory cards wins.<br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    Blockers!<br/><br/><br/>",

Food Fight is a quite detailed, &quot;wargame representation&quot; of a school cafeteria food fight.<br/><br/>The players control a student each with an action point allowance and an appearance rating which determine how much food he can absorb before being out. Characters that are better at attacking generally also have a lower threshold for absorbing damage. There are also 6 staff members who try to apprehend the students.<br/><br/>The game also has details for multiple types of foods with various ratings for each projectile's: range, slipperiness (used when they land on the floor), to-hit values and damage numbers. All results are determined with a simple d6 roll and you can even send an entire tray flying with or without food and cafeteria tables may be flipped over for even more mayhem.<br/><br/>The advanced game adds a lot to the game. The combat chart lists 30 food types each with 3 different attack modes and 7 ratings for each. There is an accuracy modification chart included. The &quot;last man&quot; standing wins.<br/><br/>",

A circuit of palaces is seeded with the items, and a marker shows which palace is being auctioned. As players bid, they move a gondola along the circuit, which points which the next auction will be when this one is resolved. Players start with 30 points on the scoring track, and there's a marker to allow debt on the same track. Debt costs double at the game end. There's also a marker to allow you to bribe the auctioneer and take a lot for no cost.<br/><br/>A series price tiles show the potential value of the next completed lot. So you might get to sell your pictures for 16 each, but you might be forced to sell when the price is only 4 each.<br/><br/>The game is totally open, and you can do the maths to work out the potential benefits to each player, but the game remains fun and quick. Tying the next auction to the current price is a clever idea too, and it can be worth bidding a bit more to control where the next auction will be. Long out of print, Canaletto stands up well with auction games like Medici.<br/><br/>This later saw incarnations in 1996 as Le Jardin and 2000 as Der Garten des Sonnenk√∂nigs.<br/><br/>",

Your mission is to have your character accumulate supplies like food, fuel, weapons, and medical kits, as well as scout locations that may serve as a haven in which to start over. Originally tailored to survival enthusiasts that wanted a real survival scenario (no zombies).<br/><br/>You start off in once-peaceful center city, now controlled by raiders out to get what you have. There are plenty of resources out there, but you have to get to them and survive various encounters and attacks to reach towns that have potential as safe havens. You&rsquo;ll have to plan your route to include spots that have the assets you&rsquo;ll need to stockpile. Some of these spots are controlled by raiders, and you&rsquo;ll have to survive attacks to gain the items you need.<br/><br/>Once you&rsquo;ve scouted locations, you&rsquo;ll have to return to center city for your family and more supplies.  You then pick a location as your final destination. If you can get there with the required supplies and survivors before anyone else, you win the game.<br/><br/>The game dynamic revolves around the management of assets while you are traveling to your destinations. You'll be tempted to use them to gain an edge in an encounter, but you have to stockpile them to be able to win the game. Different gameplay styles and a unique route traveled in each game, plus game-changing Bonus cards, add variety.<br/><br/>",

In addition, each die face contains not a number, but a colored dot of yellow, red, or blue.<br/><br/>The game lasts six rounds, with each player taking five successive rolls of the dice and scoring after each roll. After the first roll of each round, the player must pick up a specific set of dice, such as steam, and roll them again, striking at least one of the dice still on the table. Skill in precise dice rolling can result in a high score. Players receive points for different combinations, such as a set showing all yellow sides for ten points. Strategy comes into play as certain target scores and scoring combinations can result in large bonuses.<br/><br/>",

The name of the game is a portmanteau word from the German Schriftrollen (Scrolls) and Pflaumen (plums).<br/><br/>The 77 scroll cards are shuffled and the top 11 removed from the game without looking at them.  Deal each player three scrolls and give each player seven plum tokens, which are both money for bidding and victory points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each scroll is a rule of the game that must be followed when the scroll is played.  If a rule cannot be followed, the scroll is burned in the fire - that is, removed from the game.  Examples include, &quot;Each player must put three plums in the garden,&quot; if at least one player has fewer than three plums.  Or, &quot;The player with the most plums must give all other players a plum,&quot; if two or more players are tied for having the most plums.<br/><br/>Players take turns reading the scrolls they wish, enacting the new laws, all of which involve plum distribution in some way.  You don't have to enact any of your scrolls unless you have more than five, at which point you MUST activate (or burn, if illegal) enough to bring your hand down to five cards.  A player then draws a scroll, reads it silently, and auctions it off without telling the others what's on it.  He may bid for it himself.<br/><br/>The game ends when either all scrolls are taken or when the text of a read scroll requires the game to end.  The player with the most plums wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "How well do you know your Disney characters? Find out with the Disney Charades Game, which is based on the old Charades parlor game. The game includes 250 character cards showing both famous and not-so-famous characters (such as Dumbo, Donald Duck, Hercules and Mulan) from movies, original videos, and old cartoons. There are also 50 color-coded cards with easier-to-guess characters (such as Winnie the Pooh and Cinderella), so younger children will have an opportunity to act out their character assignments.<br/><br/>In each round, team members try to guess as many cards as they can before time runs out. In the first round of play, say anything as a clue. In the second round, say only one thing. But it's actions only in the third round. Score points for the cards your team guesses before time's up.<br/><br/>",

Afterwards the second player takes one of the remaining dice and moves his pawn. Then the third player follows, etc.  The last player in a round must take the last remaining die.<br/><br/>Once all players have moved the start player rolls the large white die and move the Phantom accordingly.<br/><br/>Then all the dice are passed to the next player in a clockwise direction who follows the same procedure.<br/><br/>The Phantom<br/>The player who rolled the black dice in this round moves the Phantom.  After all players finish their turns with the black die, he rolls the white die and moves the Phantom in any direction.  Afterwards the next player in a clockwise direction receives all the dice and the next round begins.<br/><br/>How Does the Phantom Move?<br/>The Phantom leaves his Start place in any direction.<br/>The Phantom may land on and over wall spaces and can also stop there. Phantom can move through rooms. It enters and leaves a room from any space.  The room represents a space and costs one point of movement.  The Phantom may not enter the End Space or a Violin Space.  He also may not move over them.<br/><br/>The White Phantom Die<br/>It shows 1 - 5 pips and a Phantom.  The pips mean that the Phantom is moved a corresponding number of fields. If the white die shows the Phantom, the Phantom must be moved into an arbitrary room.  Then the player throws the white die one more time and the Phantom moves that number of spaces from the new room. The Phantom is an Obstacle. No pawn may land on or pass through a space that the Phantom is standing on.<br/><br/>The game ends when the player that possesses a Violin and the required number of Roses can enter the End space.  A player that reaches it only by exact count is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It was met with mild success with just over 15,000 copies sold. It did, however, have three basic issues:<br/><br/>1. Hoarding: players were not required to make a play during their turn so it was possible to just collect dozens of cards then try to play them all at once. Although not a winning strategy it did kind of take the fun out of the game when someone did this.<br/>2. Two Players: The game was always best with four players. Although you could play with two people it wasn't much fun.<br/>3. Bluffing: It turns out that while some people loved the bluffing element, the majority did not care for that part.<br/><br/>NOW BETTER THAN EVER!<br/><br/>With the release of the Ten Year Anniversary Edition, all three of these issues are fixed. You can't hoard, playing with two players is definetly fun, and bluffing is now listed as an &quot;Advanced Play Option&quot; not part of the regular rules. As a bonus, the game is also fun with more than four people which was not even possible in the original release.<br/><br/>GIVE IT A TRY!<br/><br/>So if you have never played Bag-O-Loot before or if you played the original version get a copy of the new rules and see what you think!<br/><br/>",

Beginning with the active player, each player plays his or her round. After the round of the active player, the person to the left (clockwise)<br/>of the active player becomes the new active player.<br/><br/>Each round consists of 2 phases:<br/>The phase of the active player: the active player plays a dish card and draws new cards from appropriate decks.<br/>The phase of the remaining players: (it begins at the same time as the phase of the active player) each of the remaining players has the opportunity to prepare the dish played by the active player.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of the turn of the active player in which the last card is drawn from the face-down deck. The remaining inactive players may prepare the dish depicted on the card played in this round by the active player, provided that they have the necessary ingredients at their disposal. The game ends after the turn of the active player is over. To calculate the final score, each player sums up the Taste Points from the dish cards (prepared dishes) collected in his or her score pile. Additionally, players receive 1 Taste Point for each full meal consisting of 3 different types of dishes.<br/><br/>",

There are 7 people on board: The Captain himself, the captain&rsquo;s close friend Albert, the Digger who will dig for the treasures, the Gunner who will keep the natives at an arm&rsquo;s reach from the adventurers, the untrustworthy Boatsman, and, of course, two Mutineers who are just waiting for the right moment to seize command of the ship.<br/>Every time the ship reaches a new island, the Captain must choose one other crew member to take with him ashore to find treasures. The others must stay behind and look after the ship.<br/><br/>The Captain, however, is a very old and senile man. His eyesight is bad, and on top of that, it is a very dark and foggy night. So it is very difficult for him to know who is who among the crew members. To get ashore with the Captain, and get a fair (?) share of the treasures, the crew members are willing to do whatever it takes to fool the poor Captain: Including lying, tricking and conspiring.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Silent Planet, players are given the task of forming alien teams, but they are not allowed to speak to one another in the vacuum of space, so they can solve this task together only by using their non-verbal communication skills.<br/><br/>In more detail, the deck consists of 55 alien cards numbered 1-5, with more 1s than 2s, more 2s than 3s, etc. The deck also includes nine Xs, which can stand for any number. At the start of the game, you receive a hand of nine cards. Look at those cards, then arrange them in a face-down row on the table in the order of your choice, then reveal as many cards as you wish. These cards are now out of play, but you can (ideally) use them to convey information about what remains hidden in your row.<br/><br/>As a group, you are trying to form alien teams that consist of five cards of all five numbers or five cards of only one number. On a turn, all players but one collectively decide &mdash; without saying anything, but using any gestures they wish &mdash; which face-down card to reveal in the row of the player who is not taking part in the debate. Once this card is revealed, place it in the center of the table. Then the next player in clockwise order sits out while all other players decide which one of their cards to reveal and add to the team currently being formed.<br/><br/>If a card is added to a team that would break that team &mdash; e.g., adding a 3 when the face-up cards are 1 and 1, or adding a 2 when the face-up cards are 1, 2 and 4 &mdash; then you remove all face-up cards from play. X cards don't have a locked-in value, so you can consider them whatever value is needed to maintain the validity of a team. If you create a valid team of five cards, great! Put it aside, then start a new team. If you manage to create as many teams as the number of players at the table, you win; if you run out of cards and can't create enough teams, you lose.<br/><br/>",

Each player controls one of the dens, and each card in her/his hand represents one of the thieves in his/her den.  Each player chooses which of her/his thieves to make active, knowing which thieves are in every player's den (and knowing that they know which cards s/he is choosing between).  Guessing which thief another player is making active can help block and/or steal from that other player.  Players bluff and back stab their way to victory, using the lower class thieves in the city -- including the Pickpocket, the Urchin, and the Woman of Easy Virtue.

Now six dwarfs, the brothers Barbarscia and Dueforge, their friends Gronkia and Musgro and the twins Sandi and Rimba have to face Mortimer, the supreme demon.<br/>The players must choose one of the six Dwarfs, roam in the cemetery and explore the crypts of the Kings, where there are battles between Good and Evil. If the Dwarf wins the combat he gains new followers; if the Dwarf loses the combat, he becomes himself a monster (Ghoul, Werewolf or Vampire).<br/>To gain his humanity again, he must attack his ex-friends. A Dwarf can attack other Dwarfs to take objects and followers. When a Dwarf has 3 followers of his own Clan he can face Mortimer. If he wins he will be remembered for eternity.<br/><br/>",

All players, including the player who read the card, place their &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; voting card face down in front of them based on their own personal experience: &quot;Yes&quot; if you have or &quot;No&quot; if you have not.<br/><br/>Players now place one of their own tokens on the Yes/No section of all the other players, guessing whether each player said &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot; to the action on the question. At the same time all players (except the reader) have to guess what percentage of people who were polled on the question card said &quot;Yes&quot; and place one of their tokens on the percentage circles in the middle of the board that they feel is correct. Starting with the player whose turn it is, reveal your answer and score the points, one for each correct guess for each player and two for each correct guess in the percentage area.<br/><br/>During the game, players have one opportunity to &quot;Double Down&quot;, (i.e. place 2 tokens on one of the percentage circles in the middle of the board). After scores have been written, players take back their color tokens and the next player will be the reader.<br/><br/>Ending and Winning the Game:<br/>Play continues until one player accumulates the required amount of points as outlined in the beginning of the rules. Now you will find out who actually is the most &quot;NORMAL&quot;.<br/><br/>",

In Ice Cream, you have the chance to demonstrate your business skills by running an ice cream stand. You have just four days to bring in as many customers as you can - will you be the prince of pistachio, the countess of chocolate... or just a drip? Start Scooping!<br/><br/>Players receive a random ice cream card at the start of the game and every round.  The ice cream card shows a carton of ice cream in one of six flavors.  It can supply an unlimited amount of that flavor during a round. During the round, players take turns drawing an ice cream scoop card, placing it on an existing ice cream cone or starting a new cone.  Once all the cones are made, players take turns serving cones, collecting the scoop cards from a cone that they can supply.  They must be able to supply the flavors for all the scoop cards in the cone, except possibly the flavor for a single scoop card, which they would discard.  If a player cannot serve a cone, they must draw another ice cream supply card instead.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, a player receives a point for each scoop card collected, as well as for excess ice cream supply cards.  All scoops and all ice cream cards used to supply scoops are shuffled back into the deck and a new round begins. Whoever has the most points after four rounds wins.<br/><br/>This game includes rules in English, French, German, Swedish, Spanish, Japanese and Korean.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Walking Dead Card Game, based on Wolfgang Kramer's 6 nimmt!, features the same basic gameplay as that card game while adding six character cards and two modes of play: Survival and Hero.<br/><br/>To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal a number of cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.<br/><br/>In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a zombie point value. In Survival mode (for 3-10 players), players want to collect as few points as possible, while in Hero mode (for 2-6 players) you want to collect more zombie points than anyone else. In Hero mode, each player has a single-use character card that can give you an extra advantage in the round in which you play it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Marauders is an adventure-strategy game in which players explore a treasure filled island and try to outwit each other in a race to unlock a series of 6 clues that reveal the location of a hidden ancient artifact. The game is unique in that there is no &quot;point system&quot;. The game is simply won by the first player to find and recover the artifact.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling the dice, moving &quot;Scouts&quot; throughout the island, collecting jewels and other resources, and unlocking and trading clues.<br/><br/>The game's signature feature is its suspense inducing mechanism for trading clues: before any trade takes place, the two players involved must secretly decide whether to honor or dishonor the trade. Dishonoring a trade gives a player the chance to steal the clue from the other player without giving up his or her own clue, but is risky and can have serious consequences. Throughout the game, players balance the risks of earning clues on their own (which takes time), trading clues with other players (which means giving up hard earned secrets), or dishonoring trades and stealing the clues (and making enemies).<br/><br/>The game ends in a flurry of last minute deals and trades as Players try to outwit each other and unlock that one last clue...<br/><br/>HISTORY<br/><br/>Marauders was released in 2012 by Tolman Games. The 1st Edition is a prototype ready version and has a limited print run of 1,000 copies. Tolman Games released this 1st Edition through a Kickstarter campaign in September. The 2nd Edition will be updated based on feedback from Players of the 1st Edition, and is scheduled to be released as a larger print run in 2013.<br/><br/>Marauders can be played by 2 players, but 3 to 4 players are recommended.<br/><br/>",

Getting the right letters ends the heartache and leads to victory. Who ends up winning the heart of Don Juan?<br/><br/>Don Juan is based on the principle of &ldquo;I split, you choose&rdquo;. Per turn, the active player divides letters in different piles. Afterwards, each other player chooses a pile, with the remaining pile left over for the active player. The piles  consist of love letters in the colors of the players, but also of special letters such as the coveted gold letter or the dreaded bad letters.<br/> During the course of the game, getting hold of three love letters in your own color earns you a heart point. Whoever is first in collecting three heart points wins the game. However, bad letters penalize the players with broken heart tokens. By strategically mixing good and bad letters in piles, players are forced to deal with a dilemma every time they need to pick their pile. Which are the least worst piles of love letters and which piles let you win the game?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Quick Game Rules is basically rock-paper-scissors with cards (water beats fire, fire beats snow, snow beats water).  Each card has a numeric value from 1 to 12, which is used to resolve winners when the symbol is the same.  The player who wins the most battles, wins the game.<br/><br/>Under the Standard Game Rules, each player starts with a deck of 20 or more cards.  The decks are shuffled and players maintain 5 cards in their hand.  Combat can now be affected by special powers on some of the cards (for instance, &quot;fire cards become snow for this round&quot;).  The winner is the first player to collect either a set of the three cards with the same symbol and with different number colors or a set of three cards with different symbols and different number colors.<br/><br/>",

A sack is filled with many more bad things, along with one good thing, which is made of hard rubber.<br/><br/>On a turn, roll the six-sided die, then place it on the &quot;shrink your pile&quot; space. Next, draw from the sack either the one good thing or as many bad things as is indicated on the central display, which starts at 2 and increases to 8, resetting to 2 anytime a 6 is rolled on the die.<br/><br/>Whatever you draw, hold your clenched fist (or fists) out to the player on your left and say, &quot;My hand is full of bad things. Will you take them?&quot; If they decline, ask the next player. If everyone declines, then you keep any bad things in your hands; if you had the good thing, however, give away to other players as many bad things from your pile as the number shown on the die, then return the good thing to the sack.<br/><br/>If another player accepts your offer, they add the bad things to their pile or (if you held the good thing) they give to you bad things from their pile equal to the number on the die, then return the good thing to the sack.<br/><br/>If you ever have at least ten bad things in your pile, you're eliminated from the game. When only one player remains in the game, they win.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to get the combination shown on the player's card within the number of rolls given to score points. If a player is unable to complete a card an opponent can try to steal it for half points by rolling the remaining dice and if successful will be able to attempt their own card in the same turn, but failing the steal will end the turn. When all cards are claimed, the person with the most points wins.<br/><br/>The game comes with five dice, twelve cards, and a rule sheet that are all stored in a small plastic case for easy transportation and storage.<br/><br/>",

To do this, you'll need to use the dice well and take risks during play. The first player to reach the top level of the board wins!<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll six dice &ndash; five standard d6 dice and one symbol die &ndash; then use either the symbol on that special die or the sum of one or more numbers to jump your Doodler to an open pad that's horizontally adjacent or close overhead on the next level. (Each pad has a number on it, and to jump to a pad, you need dice that sum to that number.) If you fail to do this, you fall straight down to the highest unoccupied pad &ndash; which might take you all the way to the bottom of the game board! The symbols on the dice let you slide a row left or right one space, reroll your other dice, or move an unoccupied level to the top of the game board (effectively pushing players down). If you do jump or use a symbol, you can reroll the remaining dice to try to move again or you can stop where you are.<br/><br/>If you land on another Doodler, that player falls straight down. If you land on a power tile (which are not recommended for the first game), you acquire a propeller hat, shield, jetpack or jump shoes to use on a later turn; flip over a trampoline or springs, and you jump again immediately. Doodle Jump also includes monster, UFO and black hole power tiles for expert play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/>&quot;Aloha, Holiday Island. Island tourism grew explosively around 1960 and travel agents searched desperately for new paradise beaches. Your travel office asks you to explore new holiday destinations. Your task is to find the best beaches and the most attractive locations.&quot;<br/><br/>Aloha is a nice mix of tile play and push-your-luck. Players are travel reps trying to secure the best beaches by placing sun loungers on beaches as they explore the island. The tiles show a good mix of land and water, with 1-3 golden beaches on most tiles. On your turn, you jump your rep to a new place, then draw a tile. This must be placed adjacent so you can walk straight onto it, otherwise your turn is over. If you walk on, and it has a beach, you have the option of dropping a lounger in your color onto it on its side.<br/><br/>Then you can decide to push your luck and draw another tile. Each time you walk on, you may drop another lounger, but these go onto their sides. When you decide you've done enough or cannot move on anyway, you stop drawing and turn your loungers upright. But if you draw a tile you can't place so that you walk on, you lose all the loungers on their sides back to your pot. The tile still gets placed, and the game has a clever rule. Whenever a tile is placed, it must go where it touches the most tiles. So if the tile is going next to where you stand, sometimes you have no choice, the game forces its placement. But usually you have a few choices and these are crucial to pushing your luck.<br/><br/>Finally, when all the tiles are down, the island is scored. The longest beach gets a 10pt marker, the next a 9pt marker and so on (with rules for tie-breaks). Then, the player with the most loungers on that beach collects to points markers (more tie-breaks). Also, any loungers still in your pot are also worth 1 pt each.<br/><br/>At first, you think you must fight over owning beaches, and try to wrest back control of a beach. But in fact you will only win by occupying several beaches, and often you only need 3 or 4 markers to secure control. Being able to start a beach, get control, then extend it to get most points will win. Players can be unlucky and draw un-walkable tiles a few times, but this means you are not picking the correct places when jumping.<br/><br/>As the game ends, your options reduce, but you should have done your work already. The result is a nice looking island, with lush jungle and bluewater inlets, dotted with lots of loungers.<br/><br/>You have nothing to do till your turn, but if you make the right choices, you should have a winning chance. Knowing when to go one more tile matters, and knowing when to stop. Players with lots of loungers left in front of them can still win, but may have wasted their opportunities.<br/><br/>",

The players move the little witch and her raven Abraxas around to help them do her good works. If they succeed within a set number of rounds, all players win (the player who helped most wins a little bit more). Otherwise, all players lose.<br/><br/>The playing field consists of the inside of the box, which is filled with a number of steeples with loose tops. Above them, held by wooden sticks in the corner of the box, is the (cardboard) sky. The little witch moves on her broom among the churches, held and led by a magnet above the sky.<br/><br/>There are 13 cards (hidden after the games starts) showing the good tasks, each with a colored chip corresponding to a location in the 'city'. In each player turn a task gets selected. The player now has to remember the correct card and fly the little witch between the high church towers to the correct location, without accidentally knocking down one of the tipsy tops.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Dead Hand Chaos Poker deck adds a twist on traditional poker. Play virtually any poker game you can think of (7-card stud, 5-card draw, etc). At the end of a hand, if there are still two or more players left for the showdown, the top card from the draw pile is turned face-up. 60% of the cards have a hidden message on the face of the card. By tipping the card back and forth in the light, a particular card or hand will be revealed in the varnish of the card. The named card or hand (if any) is dead and out of play.<br/><br/>For instance, if the King of Spades is flipped up, the hand with the low spade is dead. If a seven is flipped, all Wild cards are dead.<br/><br/>Even with its unique twist, Dead Hand is primarily a straight-forward game of Poker. The Dead Hand mechanic ends up only effecting approximately 20% of the hands played. So don't use the mechanic as a crutch, you've still got to play good poker.<br/><br/>That said, you may find that the added element of chance keeps people in the game longer and folding a bit less than they might otherwise. A reference card is included, so you can watch which cards have been played and have a better idea of which hands are more likely to be killed by the Dead Hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thanks to the Google Assistant, the quiz game kNOW! asks questions that would never have been possible before in a tabletop game. The answers to many of the 1,500+ questions change daily and vary depending on where you play: &quot;When will the sun rise tomorrow?&quot;, &quot;How far is it from here to Honululu?&quot;, or &quot;What time is it in Sydney now?&quot; Google's free digital voice assistant has the answers to these and many other questions. Players might also be challenged by tongue twisters and other odd phrases. For additional variety, new questions and theme specials will be added &quot;in the box&quot; for free.<br/><br/>Thanks to the digital timer, the game takes as long as players want, with a rules explanation via the Google Assistant. If you don't have online access, kNOW! is still playable without the voice assistant.<br/><br/>The game comes in two versions, one featuring only the game and one packaged with a Google Home Mini.<br/><br/>",

The best hand in each realm wins, and a Warrior is summoned from the winning cards &ndash; but the weakest cards also summon the most powerful Warriors, with the 2 card in each suit (Fire, Metal, Earth, Water, Wood) summoning a mighty Dragon. With these recruited Warrior tokens, players advance on their opponents to gain ascendancy in the Realms. They can also wager and collect Legend cards, which when combined into sets can be used to powerful effect, including bringing forth uniquely damaging Warriors.<br/><br/>",

Otherwise, the card can be discarded at the moment there are more than one person to guess left. <br/>     The player who guessed the facial expression immediately takes 1 white from the draw pile card and scores 1 point.<br/>     The current player then draws a new card to make others guess another facial expression and so on until the end of the hourglass.

The first squirrel to gather 15 pine cones in his hoard wins.  Spaces on the track give you one to three pine cones when you land on them, and the special die makes you lose your move now and then --instead, every squirrel gets a free pine cone.<br/>   The tricky part is that your wheelbarrow tips over and loses its contents whenever you exceed its capacity: six pine cones.  Every other squirrel laps the track in the opposite direction to yours, so there are plenty of squirrel encounters.  Every time you leap over another squirrel (going one way or the other), you can steal from or give to him up to three of your cones.  Therein lies all the strategy.<br/><br/>",

Each round relies on players&rsquo; own movie knowledge, so you can never play the same game twice. You guide the game; we just give you the tools to best show off your skills. Whether it&rsquo;s a fiercely competitive game with your best buds, or a fun family night, Movie Buff brings it!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to create Takes to complete the Scene. A Take is laying down at least one each of all four Trivia Cards (Movie, Actor, Role, and Quote) connected to one specific film. A Scene is our fancy &ldquo;movie speak&rdquo; way of saying the cards you have been dealt.<br/><br/>Shuffle and deal ten cards to each player. The remaining cards become the Draw Pile. The person who most recently saw a movie begins game by playing one Trivia Card face up in a Play Pile, and naming an Actor, Movie, Role, or Quote, starting the Scene. Player 2 will then play one Trivia or Strategy card face up. Play continues clockwise, with each player using the cards in their hand to keep the Scene going until one player gets rid of all of their cards. If you do not have a playable card, take a card from the Draw Pile and your turn is over. The game ends when one player completes the scene, discarding all the cards in their hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Best of British Game Rules<br/>A game for 2 teams of any number or 2-6 individual players.<br/><br/>The Team Game is great when you have a mix of younger and older players. It makes best use of everybody's knowledge. The individual game is great if you want to be more competitive.<br/><br/>CONTENTS:<br/>Best of British Playing Board<br/>400 Best of British Question Cards<br/>6 Playing pieces<br/><br/>TEAM RULES<br/>PREPARING TO PLAY<br/>Unfold the board and lay it on the table. Each team selects a playing piece and places it on the Start Space on the board.<br/><br/>Split the players into two teams. The oldest player in each team will become the first Question Master for their team. The team containing the youngest player will start.<br/><br/>THE QUESTIONS<br/>There are four questions on the back of each card. The first question is beside the Red Square followed by the White, Blue and Green.<br/><br/>There are three kinds of question cards:<br/><br/>Picture cards - on which there is a picture that the questions relate to.<br/><br/>Common Theme Cards - on which all the answers have a common theme.<br/><br/>Pot Luck Cards - on which there are random Best of British questions.<br/><br/>THE BOARD<br/>The board is a path from the outer Start space into the Winning Zone in the centre of the board. The spaces on the board are made up of the four different colours that match those on the Question Cards. The first four spaces on the board match the order of those on the cards.<br/><br/>After the first four spaces the colour order becomes random so just answering one question correctly can sometimes mean a big leap forward.<br/><br/>PLAY<br/>The Question Master for the team containing the youngest player picks up the first Question Card from the box making sure the answers are concealed from all the players on both teams.<br/><br/>If it is a Picture Card, the picture is shown to all the players on both teams. If it is a Themed Card, the theme is read out to all the players on both teams.<br/><br/>The Question Master reads out the Red Question to the opposing team. If that team answers correctly they move their piece onto the first Red Space on the board. The same team is then given the White Question, moving their piece onto the White Space if they answer correctly and so on down the card.<br/><br/>If at anytime a question is answered incorrectly then the Question Master can put the same question to the members of their own team for a bonus move. If they answer correctly they move their own piece onto the next space on the board that matches the colour of the question. The original team is always given the first chance to answer each question. After the Green Question has been played the card is placed to the back of the card box.<br/><br/>The Question Master for the other team now takes out the next card from the box and plays the card to their opponents in the same way.<br/><br/>The two teams take alternate turns at being the Question Master and also alternate the roll of Question Master within their team.<br/><br/>When any team answers a question correctly and there are no spaces left matching that colour left on the path, they move their piece directly into the Winning Zone.<br/><br/>WINNING ZONE<br/>Once inside the Winning Zone a team no longer moves their piece after answering a question correctly. The first team to answer any bonus question correctly after having entered the Winning Zone wins.<br/><br/>INDIVIDUAL PLAY<br/>The oldest player becomes Question Master for the first game and asks the first card to the player on their left. The bonus opportunity for any incorrect answer passes firstly to the next player to the left and so on. The order of play then continues in a clockwise direction.<br/><br/>Source: Publisher's Website<br/><br/>",

Picture cards are placed between two number cards. If the picture card is a Pac-Man card, the two number cards which bracket it are added together.<br/><br/>If the card is a Ghost card, the number card on the right is subtracted from the card on the left. So opponents are allowed to place ghost cards and number cards on opponents game boards in an attempt to hinder point scoring.<br/><br/>There is also a Pac-Man eating a Ghost card which acts as a multiplier between the two numbers.<br/><br/>Players play one card per turn, and the person who reaches 100 points if the winner.<br/><br/>An advanced version would subtract points from the players running total if the three card combination included a ghost and the subtraction resulted in a negative total.<br/><br/>",

Only successful jumps and formations will score you points with the jury.<br/><br/>Boogie Beasts is a card game under time pressure, where bluffing and lying is expressly allowed. Teaming up with other jumpers increases your potential score, but also risks failing the jump all together.

Each player get 6 warriors, 3 rangers, 2 guardians, and one time lord. Guardians can capture warriors and rangers; rangers can capture warriors; the time lord can capture rangers and guardians; but the lowly warriors are the only ones who can capture the time lord and win the game. Captures are made by moving next to rather than on top of enemy pieces. Each piece can move only one space at a time but they can also &quot;warp&quot; by leaving the board and leaving a 4-D marker behind. The piece can then stay in the warp zone for up to three turns or warp back onto the board up to two spaces away from the 4-D marker. This game has an inconveniently small gameboard and plastic pieces that look like little futuristic chairs.<br/><br/>The game was first published in Games &amp; Puzzles magazine. The designers produced it as a standalone game later the same year, and it was later licensed by TSR.<br/><br/>",

This is done by placing their plunger in one of the vacant spaces on their side of the board and then banging it.  If their opponent has a piece in that corresponding space, it will pop up into the air.  Pieces captured in this way remain out of the game until that player moves his king up to the dividing wall, at which point he can claim a captured knight piece back (but also tips off his opponent that his king is in the front row).  The first player to move two pieces into the front row (next to the dividing wall) wins the game.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, you roll the die, then take one of three actions depending on the roll:<br/><br/>&bull; Move one frog 1-3 spaces.<br/>&bull; Leap one frog over an adjacent frog to an empty space, repeating the leaps if you want to and can.<br/>&bull; Move the stork onto a frog that hasn't reached the safety of home, and remove the frog from the game.

Each frog at home scores 1-3 points depending on its location, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Variants include splitting movement across several frogs and racing towards a common home area shared by all players.<br/><br/>",

Each game is played for 12 rounds and in every round one ship card can be 'won' by playing steering cards: Steering cards of the same wind direction as the current ship card count with their full value of points, cards with a wind direction perpendicular to that on the current ship card count with half their value and cards of the opposite wind direction count as zero points. The player who played the lowest point value gets the ship card. After 12 rounds, the player with the LEAST total of points on his collected ship cards scores the most victory points (depending on the number of players). There are, however, several possibilities to score extra victory points for certain combinations of ship cards. Thus, collecting ship cards may also be a good thing if a player can obtain the right combinations.<br/><br/>",

When the fires of the revolution died down, a political game began to establish the only proper totalitarian regime. The players take the roles of animal dictators who will stop at nothing to gain absolute power over the global Farm.<br/><br/>1984: Animal Farm is a negotiation game for 3 to 5 players that's based on the concept of forced cooperation. On one hand, players share some business with their neighbors; on the other hand, they are divided by the will to win. The game favors efficient strategy, slick negotiations, and successful bluffing. At the same time, it forces the players to form temporary alliances with their enemies and keep an eye on their friends. All this makes each round of the game abound in heated talks (both public and secret), pacts, promises, and betrayals. Special abilities drawn before the game, along with the winning conditions, guarantee that no two games will be the same.<br/><br/>&quot;Remember, fellow revolutionaries: All animals are equal, but some are more equal than others!&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Dungeon Hustle, 2-4 players are archetypal fantasy characters running through a dungeon picking up swords, keys, shields, scrolls and potions. Each item comes in different colors, and to pick them up, you must hustle through a path of dungeon tiles of matching color; once you step on a new color (or a corner space), you pick up the tiles that you had stepped on. If, for example, you start on a red key and move on a path that consists of a red sword, another red key, a red shield, and finally a white sword, you stop on the white sword, then pick up all of the red items, including the one where you started movement. You use these items to fight monsters, fulfill quests, and purchase other items.<br/><br/>Dungeon Hustle includes a few semi-cooperative elements. A character can help give a power to another character, for example, and is then rewarded for doing so. More importantly, you must all work together to stop monsters from escaping the dungeon. After a certain number of monsters escapes, the game ends, and whoever has the most victory points at that time wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from the general Comment:<br/>This is essentially a card game. Cards come in four basic suits plus a special gray &quot;political power&quot; suit. The cards have values from 5 - 50, with the most cards in the middle of the range. In your turn, you challenge an opponent to a duel in one of the suits. You play a card in any suit (not necessarily the one you are challenging in) , then your opponent plays a card in the same suit. Players can alternately withdraw, or keep going. You then play a different suit - in the same manner, adding up your total score. The suit you challenged in counts double. If the defender withdraws, the challenger places a base (i.e. scores a point) on the defender. If the challenger withdraws, he just finishes his turn without scoring. However, the loser forfeits all cards played (redrawing, but perhaps taking poorer cards), and the winner holds his played cards, and takes the loser's cards into a pool which can score points.<br/><br/>If no one withdraws after all four suits have been played, players may add gray cards in an attempt to take the lead. Ultimately, a player will pass or run out of gray cards, at which point the high score will win the hand.<br/><br/>",

Ground-unit counters represent infantry battalions (500 to 600 men), artillery battalions (12 to 18 guns with crews), armored reconnaissance squadrons (eight to 12 vehicles and their crews), a heavy machinegun company (120 men with heavy machineguns), and special forces teams (25 to 50 men). Ship and submarine counters each represent one vessel.<br/><br/>Each turn represents between one to three days, depending on the current operational tempo. Each inch on the Tactical Area Map equals five miles. Each inch on the Strategic Sea Area Map equals 100 miles. The game uses an adaptation of the system originally created for our Red Dragon Rising game.<br/><br/>Special rules cover such things as: Operation Black Buck, decisive leadership, Exocet missiles, stealth aircraft, reinforcements, off-map areas, naval transport, airbase limits, submarine operations, strategic airlift, rebasing, ship repair, special forces raids, the Total Exclusion Zone, aerial interception, cross-decking, naval surface actions, ground assault, heliborne movement, the Argentine mainland, protected targets, entrenchments, mountain combat, severe weather, and much more.

Movement is accomplished by flipping the disk over a number of times equal to it's movement.  Combat occurs when a disk overlaps an enemy disk.  Anyone familiar with Diskwars will feel at home with this game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "COMPONENTS<br/>20 Ship tiles (4 aircraft carriers, 4 submarines, 4 destroyers, 4 battleships, 4 patrol boats)<br/>8 attack dice<br/><br/>Battleship Express comes with two different games: The Captain&rsquo;s Game and The Admiral&rsquo;s Game. The Captain's Game ignore the ships powers on the cards.<br/><br/>Each player receives 5 ship tiles, one of each ship: Battleship, Destroyer, Aircraft Carrier, Submarine, Patrol Boat. Each player places them in front of them in any order to make up their fleet.<br/><br/>On a player's turn they choose one of the ships in their Fleet to attack with and move it to the front of their line. Next the player chooses a ship of an opposing player to attack. The attacking player can only choose one of the first 2 ships in the line to attack. The attacking ship tile shows how many dice to roll. Roll that number of dice and check for hits. Each of the 8 dice is the same. 5 of the sides match the colors of the 5 ships, and the sixth side is a &ldquo;burst&rdquo; or &ldquo;wild&rdquo;. IF the player does not sink it, the dice are passed to the next player.<br/><br/>Set aside any hits and then re-roll based on the attacking ship&rsquo;s powers. Once the number of hits equals or exceeds the defense number on the ship that's defending, it is sunk removed from play and the attacking player gets a point. The first player to an agreed number of set points wins. Here&rsquo;s a breakdown of the individual ship powers:<br/><br/><br/>     Battleship: Declare target. Roll all 8 dice a total of 4 times. Bursts do not count as hits.<br/>     Destroyer: Declare target. Roll 6 dice a total of 2 times. Bursts count as 2 hits.<br/>     Aircraft Carrier: Roll 6 dice THEN declare your target, then roll 1 more time. Bursts count as 1 hit. The Aircraft Carrier can also attack from anywhere in your line, so you don&rsquo;t have to move it to the front where it is vulnerable.<br/>     Submarine: Roll 3 dice a total of one time. A single Burst will sink whatever you are attacking. Submarines can attack any ship at any place in a Fleet.<br/>     Patrol Boat: Roll 5 dice a total of 3 times. Bursts count as 1 hit.<br/><br/><br/>Part of the Hasbro Express Line.<br/><br/>",

There is always a plenty of those who are eager to take this place, so when such a chance comes up, they&rsquo;re ready to take it by all means.<br/><br/>The city of Urbis is ruled by the City Council elected by the residents. The main objective of the game is to become the Head of the Council. Like all the other players, you are a Council member who is responsible for the well-being and prosperity of the city.  Each Council member (player) has an access to the city treasury and guard, and is obliged to follow the Council&rsquo;s decreets. Each councillor is in charge of one of the city blocks (represented by a board given to each player in the beginning of the game) and aspires to develop his block either quickly or proficiently. Gold and silver from the treasury are distributed depending on the buildings that have been put up on the block. However the block residents are always on the lookout: no one wants to live close to the cemetery, gibbet or prison. Take thought for the residents, spend some money, and these grim buildings will appear on the neighbour&rsquo;s block instead of your own. Hospital is also an essential city institution but it demands substantial charges to maintain. Taking this into account a player might awaken his inner dictator and build up his block with slums and honky-tonks, regardless of the residents&rsquo; needs, because the first player to fill all the building slots on his block becomes a winner.  Which way is the best? To consider the block residents or to just execute the will of the Council? To turn your block into a dark place or a blooming garden? In Urbis you&rsquo;ll have to make decisions promptly.<br/><br/>",

And what a Fief!!! ... an uncultivated land piece with a village of wanderers! And as if it was not enough, the neighboring Fiefs have been granted to your worst adversaries, who will not hesitate to try to kill you! Maybe it is not a reward, but a punishment?<br/><br/>Medievalia is a strategic game where each player represents a Feudal Lord trying to prevail over his neighbors. <br/>During the first phases of the game the players develop their Fief by increasing the number of cultivated fields and the population. Subsequently, they will begin constructing buildings, specializing the population in several professions and abilities, and then they will start creating their army. All these operations are performed in the same way: the player puts in the cards from his own hand. Every card that comes in play costs a certain amount of resources and it can produce a certain amount of resources. Producing more resources during the game allows playing more and more powerful cards and provides more maneuverability.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.giochix.it/scheda.php?item=1417&amp\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.giochix.it/scheda.php?item=1417&amp</a>;crowd=0&amp;lingua=0<br/><br/>",

A card is secretly drawn and a &quot;clue giver&quot; tries to get his team to say the word on it...without using any of three related words that are also on the card. The team has a timer during which they score as many clues as possible.  The number correct is the number of squares the token is moved.<br/><br/>One difference from the original game is that the &quot;buzzer&quot; is actually a plastic squeak toy instead of the harsh electric buzzer.  The clues are also much easier, common words than in the adult game.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Taboo<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Obscura tempora is an easy card game settled in the Dark Ages. Each player is a faction that tries to expand his power and starts with a castle and a town. He can add towns and abbeys to his belongings, and also build ports, markets and walls on his towns. Each castle, town, abbey, market and port is worth a money card each turn, but only one per turn can go safely into the castle: the others must be kept in towns and abbeys. Towns can be pillaged and abbeys can change ownership thanks to the action cards: militia, catapults, saracene pirates and bishops.<br/>The goal is to reach a certain amount of money, but every turn the choice is between keeping it or spending it to get more action and building cards.<br/>The drawings are by Valeria De Caterini, an Italian artist and writer of children books.<br/><br/>",

As those who recall their university days will recall, stress is always right around the corner, and stressed students can&rsquo;t hope to succeed. Students can just try to avoid stress or they can look for relaxation by interrupting their opponents&rsquo; own attempts to study.<br/><br/>At the end of the game&mdash;which comes when a player draws the second special card announcing the end of semester&mdash;players calculate their scores, and the player with the highest final score wins.<br/><br/>",

The participants play the role of dwarf treasure seekers who decided to pay a visit at a dragon&rsquo;s den while the dragon was away. They managed to get inside. Unfortunately, while they were plundering the treasure, the dragon return unexpectedly. Certainly, it will not be polite towards anybody caught stealing its possessions. It is a common knowledge that dwarfs tend to be greedy and it would be considered a dishonour to simply throw away the precious stuff. For that reason you need get rid of the treasure in a clever way&hellip;.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to dispose of the gold completely or to have the fewest Gold coins the moment the Dragon arrives. As we know, dragons have the sixth sense that helps them localise gold and valuables. The dragon will focus on the most greedy treasure hunters. The arrival of the beast will cause such a confusion that only one dwarf will be able to escape and others will be burnt to ashes.<br/><br/>The cards<br/><br/>There are three kinds of cards in the deck:<br/>dwarf cards- the ones you play in your round (a coin symbol),<br/>counteraction &ndash; the ones you play to respond to other players cards&rsquo; effects (a shield icon), dragon&rsquo;s card.<br/><br/>Each card has its own name (usually a dwarf quotation) and a graphic symbol of its effects.<br/><br/>The game setup<br/><br/>Shuffle the cards carefully. Put the Dragon card at the bottom of the Deck.<br/><br/>Each player collects 20 gold coins and draws 4 cards from the top of the Deck.<br/><br/>Place the remaining gold next to the Deck. From now on it is called the Dragon&rsquo;s Treasure.<br/><br/>The game overview<br/><br/>The person who is most generous starts the game. Continue playing your turns clockwise. At the beginning of his or her turn each player draws a number of cards so they have a total of 4 cards in their hands.<br/><br/>In their turns the players can:<br/><br/>    play any number of cards and resolve its effects,<br/>    discard any number of cards.<br/><br/><br/>Important: the amount of gold and number of cards is known to all the players during the whole game.<br/><br/>",

The puzzles range from single to four card ones, and from light to quite heavy.<br/>Players can use hints to help with the solving, but it costs them Reputation cards. Giving a wrong answer also makes the players lose a Reputation card.<br/>The more Reputation Cards the players have left at the end, the easier it is for them to follow the &quot;Hunch&quot; found on the remaining cards, and ultimately choosing the correct option in the &quot;Final Choice&quot;<br/>The high age recommendation comes from a few graphic details in the story. These can be skipped by parents playing with their children (12+), as long as they are aware such exist in the game.<br/><br/>Challenge Level 3/5<br/><br/>",

Any tiles that can't be used are left on the table and turned over again where they are. No tiles may be added to or removed from a row on a scoreboard that contains only one or two tiles. If none of the tiles turned up can fit on a free row, the player must declare one of his free rows invalid by placing one of the tiles turned up face down on the first square of the row (the others are returned to the table face down).<br/><br/>Game ends after the tenth round, and the winner is the one with the most points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION<br/>Aliens are among us! Coming from a distant planet they do not have peaceful intentions: they are ready to assimilate humanity to make us blue, small and flabby just like them. And since the day was not already awful enough, they want to start right from your city. They are plenty, smart and wicked, just like fag ash, but do not panic: as current lodger of planet Earth, we still have some aces in the hole to play.<br/><br/>On our side, we have unshakable field agents, tough to the bones and loyal to the cause, although limited when it is time to take action. We can also count on a brilliant group of scientists: if these eggheads could just work together, they might indeed find a way to prevent the imminent invasion... too bad that at the first warning they fled and scatter to the ends of the city! They might be braniacs but definitely miss the guts.<br/><br/>As part of the resistance, your mission is to coordinate the agents on the field and gather all the scientists before the aliens complete their plan of conquering the city. You shall send orders from your secret headquarter, but be aware: the enemy is looking for you, and if it manages to localize you, it would assimilate and bring you by its side with no hesitation! If that happens you will end up in the perfect situation to undermine all the effort of your former comrades.. the Earthlings!<br/><br/>COURSE OF THE GAME<br/><br/>The game is divided in three stages that repeat until the end of the game:<br/>1. Event execution (carried out by the architect)<br/>2. Players&lsquo; turns (carried out by all players clockwise)<br/>3. Consolidation (carried out by the architect)<br/><br/>1. Event execution <br/>The invasion is underway! At any moment an alien attack or a stroke of luck can completely change the situation...<br/><br/>The architect turns over the top card of<br/>the events deck and execute its effects.<br/>Then, he discards the card.<br/><br/>2. Players&lsquo; turns<br/><br/>Each player will be able to command agents in the city or to plan the best strategy to pursue his/her goal. Beware, though: with each action there is the risk of being detected and assimilated by aliens! The alien players may choose to stay hidden until the end of the game or to reveal themselves (without showing their cards)to be in favor with other alien players at the price of exposing themselves to the opposing faction.<br/><br/>During his/her turn a player may have to perform risky actions that require to draw a given number of assimilation cards. Once drawn, the cards must be kept secret and cannot be revealed to other players. By drawing at least<br/>one Assimilated! card a player becomes an alien. From this very moment on, his/her goal is to let the alien faction win the game! If the assimilation deck is empty the player can still perform his/her actions without drawing any card. An alien player drawing a Human card is still alien. Moreover, drawing two or more Assimilated! Cards does not change the situation.<br/>Once alien, alien forever!<br/><br/>3. Consolidation<br/><br/>After all players have completed their turn, the field is prepared for the next stages.<br/><br/>THE GOAL OF THE GAME<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to save all the scientists on the map before the invasion is completed. To archive this objective you must keep out the aliens from the rescue. Keep your eyes on your neighbours, they may no longer be the friends you used to trust, not anymore.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rail Raiders Infinite is a chibi sci-fi western board game for 2 to 4 players. Raid the Interstellar Express space-rail to earn loot, infamy, and the ire of C.O.W. and the Galactic Central Bank. In order to loot the train you&rsquo;ll need to first dispose of the meddlesome Tinstar Lawbots, who will do everything in their power to stop your heist. Team up with other Raiders, or do what bandits do best, double-crossing them when their chips are down. Anything goes when you&rsquo;re out to make a big score!<br/><br/>In Rail Raiders Infinite, players assume control of a bandit raiding the Interstellar Express space-rail. Raiders move from car to car searching for loot. The player who gets the biggest haul of double-dollars before the train makes it to the station wins the game. Combat and other actions are determined by rolling a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; of five or more custom poker dice. The player who scores the highest hand wins the roll.<br/><br/>Train Cars, except for the locomotive and caboose, always start the game face down showing the roof side of the car. This way raiders don&rsquo;t know where the richest opportunities or the most Law Bots are beforehand. When a Raider moves onto, or starts its turn on, a face down car it may turn that car face up. Once a Train Car is turned face up, then Loot tokens are placed on the car and Long Arm of the Law cards are drawn equal to the numbers shown on the car.<br/><br/>Each player takes control of a single Raider. Each Raider has a model and a card with a unique ability which only that Raider may use. A Raider may take three actions during its turn from the following choices: Move, Search, or Showdown. Any action type can only be performed twice during a player&rsquo;s turn. So while a player gets to take three actions only two of them can be the same type of action.<br/><br/><br/>     Move: The Raider may move to an adjacent train car.<br/>     Search: The Raider may reveal a Loot token and draw the number of Loot cards shown. A Raider may not Search if a Lawbot is on the same train car.<br/>     Showdown: The Raider gets into a shootout with Lawbots or opposing Raiders!<br/><br/><br/>At the beginning of a Raider's turn, a High Noon card is drawn. High Noon cards have special effects which may affect the turn's game play. Additionally, the High Noon deck serves as a timer for the game. Once the High Noon deck has been exhausted, the train has reached the station and the Raiders need to jump off the train or be captured!<br/><br/>Long Arm of the Law cards tell you how many, and what type of, Lawbots to place on the train car. Some Long Arm of the Law cards even have special effects that may swing the tide of the game allowing Lawbots to roll more dice, gain rerolls, or even speed up the train!<br/><br/>Poker dice are used to resolve shootouts and other situations within the game. Each die features six values: 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, and Joker. Players roll a hand of five dice and then attempt to make the highest poker hand from the results. The player with the highest hand wins!<br/><br/>",

Each character has a variety of characteristics.  Each player also gets some question cards.  Each player then takes turns asking their question to the other players.  If you get a Yes, you may draw another question card and ask another question.  If you get a No, you may ask no more questions, but may try to guess the identity of all the players.  A nice mechanism for showing if the player is right is part of the game.  When a player makes his guesses a box is handed around and each player puts a chip in the Yes side if his identity was correctly guessed or a chip in the No side if it was not.  The guessing player looks at the results and the game ends if all the chips are in the Yes side.  Else the game continues.<br/>There are also some oddball characters that will either: always lie, always answer no, or answer yes or no to any question.<br/><br/>",

If the player lands on an as-yet-unowned property, he has the opportunity to buy it and add it to his portfolio or allow the bank to auction it to the highest bidder. If a player owns all the spaces within a color group, he may then build houses and hotels on these spaces, generating even more income from opponents who land there. If he lands on a property owned by another player, he must pay that player rent according to the value of the land and any buildings on it. There are other places on the board which can not be bought, but instead require the player to draw a card and perform the action on the card, pay taxes, collect income, or even go to jail.<br/><br/>",

Each round, three to five plus/minus cards are laid out based on the number of players, with +1 being the highest value and -2 being the lowest. Task cards are then laid out below each plus/minus card other than the -2; these task cards show either a sum or an image of three dice with specific pip values. Once the cards are in place, players start rolling their dice simultaneously, setting aside any they want to save while trying to match what's shown on one of the task cards.<br/><br/>As soon as a player meets a task with her dice, she can throw her claim card on it, which prevents others from claiming that task. Once all but one player have claimed a task, the round ends. Whoever failed to complete a task loses two blitz tokens, while everyone else loses one, holds onto the same amount, or gains one based on the plus/minus card associated with their completed task.<br/><br/>Players then set up a new round by dealing out new task cards and rolling dice once again. When a player has to return a blitz token but is unable to do so, the game ends and whoever holds the most blitz tokens wins.<br/><br/>",

What's more, your dreams have told you that the time has come, the stars have aligned so that you can perform the &quot;Ritual of Appeal&quot; and bring the Grand Octopus to surface once again. To perform the ritual, however, you need the right magical components, components to be found in a famous English university for young wizards and witches &mdash; and you're not the only one seeking them.<br/><br/>In each round, players secretly place their cultist and monster tokens on locations, then reveal those locations at the same time. If only one cultist group occupies a location, that cult gains strength &mdash; but if two or more cults want the same spot, they must negotiate or both lose cult strength. If, on the other hand, a rival monster occupies the location, the cultist is eliminated. Gulp!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zombies, Run! The Board Game is a digitally-enhanced boardgame set in the Zombies, Run! universe. It combines the co-op strategy of tabletop games like Pandemic with the dynamic narratives of digital games like The Walking Dead, powered by Six to Start's own brand of app-driven audio storytelling.<br/><br/>Players gather around a printed map of Abel Township, the home base of the Zombies, Run! universe. The map shows nearby towns, forests, farms, along with vital information about the location of zombies, supplies, and other settlements. Working together, the players embark on missions across the map, searching for supplies, rescuing survivors, and investigating the cause of the outbreak.<br/><br/>But danger is never far away, with our unique real-time &quot;running&quot; card mechanic forcing players to use all their skill, nerve and co-ordination to survive. Will they reach their destination safely, or will they fall prey to the pursuing undead?<br/><br/>During a mission, the players act as &ldquo;Runners&rdquo; sent out by Abel. Our companion iPhone/Android app uses audio and on-screen prompts to immerse the players in the game and story - informing them of threats, opportunities and events. Players can choose to investigate these, finding life-saving supplies, new storylines, or perhaps a hidden horde of zombies!<br/><br/>Uniquely, players must react to situations in real-time, making tough decisions as the pursuing horde draws closer.<br/><br/>The missions they choose and the decisions they make will constantly transform the game world and map. Settlements become overrun with the living dead and must be crossed out on the map, or marked with warnings. Hidden trails are found, opening new paths to explore and new secrets to uncover. Reports are heard on the radio of hordes moving in from the East - but how close, and how fast? The players track their story on the map itself, with annotations, stickers and counters turning the game board into an ever-evolving picture of the world.<br/><br/>",

The bottom row will consist of 7 cards, with the peak consisting of a single card.<br/><br/>The player works to remove all cards from the pyramid by making sets of two cards that add up to 13.  Aces are worth 1, Jacks are 11, Queens 12, and Kings 13 (and can be removed individually).<br/><br/>The remaining cards make up the Stock, or draw pile, and can be used to make sets.<br/><br/>The game is over if no more sets can be removed from the board, and a score is given by the value of cards left in the pyramid.  Thus, a perfect score is 0.<br/><br/>",

Then turn those systems against your opponent!<br/><br/>Space Base Mutiny is a fast-paced game with a sci-fi theme. The goal is simple; a player wins when he or she has used up all of her tokens. On your turn, you can use a unit to invade an enemy space OR remove a unit from a system you control to use that system's power. You then check to see which systems (if any) you gained control of.<br/><br/>The game features Area Collection Powers. When you occupy 3 spaces of the same color, you gain control of that color system. Each system gives you a special power that you can use on future turns. You can use the Weapons System to attack 2 adjacent units, the Air Lock System to jettison 2 enemy units into the vacum of space, the Gravity System to tumble units around the base, and the Command System to negotiate disarmament.<br/><br/>In addition to these system powers, each token has one of 6 unique race powers. Each time you place a token to invade a space, you trigger that tokens's race power. Cyborgs hack into the systems, Parasites infect enemy tokens, Telepaths use mind control to attack adjacent tokens, Space Worms breach the hull to attack outer tokens, Humans negotiate disarmament, and Blobs copy the race powers of the tokens they attack.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Risk Battlefield Rogue combines the tactical squad-based team play from the award-winning Battlefield series with the strategy and skill of the Risk game.<br/><br/>The game comes with nine different scenarios, each with its own victory condition. In each scenario, you choose tiles to combine to form the battlefield. Then, you use squads to achieve your objective. You might be fighting to control a zone, placing units in a certain location, or eliminating your opponent's units. There are three levels of play: Boot Camp, Intermediate, and Advanced. The Advanced mode includes rules for air support, destructible cover, special commander powers, and class-specific powers.<br/><br/>On their turn, players will draw cards based on how many and which type of control points they own, move aircraft, fight other aircraft, move one squad, and fire with one squad. The game's cards allow players to recruit new units, call in airstrikes, or manipulate combat odds by upgrading the specialized attack and defense dice to more powerful ones with better results. The winning player or team is the one that accomplishes the stated victory condition on a scenario, usually by holding a specific set of territories or eliminating an entire opposing force.<br/><br/>",

Most of them show a single letter and a point value, which is the higher the more rarely that letter is used in the German language. There are also joker cards (can be used as any letter), and delete cards (can cover up letters at the start or end of a word).<br/>Each player gets 7 cards.<br/>The expandable card holder, in which the letter cards are placed to form words, is set to three slots (maximum length is 9).<br/>To determine a start player, each player tries to form a three-letter word from his/her cards. The player whose word has the highest point value puts a three-letter word into the card holder, his/her points are written down and he/she refills his/her hand to 7. Players then take turns building words from their letter cards. Turn length is determined by a sand timer.<br/><br/>Rules for building words:<br/><br/>     A new word is constructed by putting cards over the previous word, or by adding an additional letter.<br/>     The new word must be at least three letters long.<br/>     The new word can be up to one letter longer than the previous word.<br/>     At least one letter from the previous word must be re-used.<br/>     Creating a new word by adding only a delete or joker card is a valid move.<br/><br/><br/>A player can exchange cards from his/her hand for cards from the draw deck at a cost of -2 points per card.<br/>If a player manages to create a new word before the timer runs out, he/she gets the corresponding points. Bonus points are given for using three or more new cards.<br/>A player who couldn't create a new word gets an additional card. At the end of his/her turn, a player always refills his/her hand to 7.<br/><br/>The game ends when the draw deck has been exhausted and <br/><br/>     a player has no cards left, or<br/>     all players have passed once.<br/><br/><br/>Players add up their points from all rounds. Remaining hand cards count negative points, according to their point value.<br/>The player with the highest total wins the game.<br/><br/>",

You may soon regret your nefarious dealings, though, as your enemies may lose, but that doesn't mean you're safe from them!

        "description": "In 1884, the major European imperialist powers &ndash; Great Britain, France, Germany and Belgium &ndash; were busy struggling to get a piece of the cake that was colonial Africa. At first they sent missions dedicated to exploration, but this quickly changed to vying for favorable concessions, treaties, and even settlements. This race for supremacy and the desire to be the first to establish a foothold in Africa provoked an endless series of confrontations and conflicts.<br/><br/>In Expedition: Congo River 1884 &ndash; the first title in Rivero's &quot;Expedition&quot;-series, which will take place all around the world &ndash; a paddle-wheeler steamboat is about to leave Leopoldville (now Kinshasa) and sail up the Congo River bound for the remote village of Kindu in the heart of deepest Africa. While the travelers aboard the steamer are of many different nationalities and professions, they all share the same spirit of adventure. Each player controls a group of these travelers and must compete with their opponents to take command of the colonial stations found at each stop along the steamer's trip upstream. Players gain victory points for each station under their command. The player with most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player is given the task of convincing someone else that certain crazy subjects &ndash; such as glitter monsters or magnetic hands - are better, worse, or just plain weirder than others. If you can successfully do this and earn the most points, you win and get to demand that all of your friends do everything you say for the next 24 hours&hellip; Ok, that&rsquo;s not really true. Turns out we can&rsquo;t force mind control on your opponents, but at least you win the game!<br/><br/>Each game is different, because the players get to change the story every time they play depending on which transmog words are paired with each question. Jetpack Unicorn is easy enough for true beginners to pick up, but it&rsquo;ll keep even the most advanced storytellers entertained for hours on end!<br/><br/>265 cards.<br/><br/>",

Players start from Home Port as merchants and set out on a trading voyage. By throwing the die, they sail to exotic ports like the Pearl Coast, the Jewel Coast and the Spice Islands. When they arrive at a port they pay a trading fee and draw a card which tells them what cargo they have bought. Cargoes range from codfish and coal to precious spices, pearls and diamonds,!<br/><br/>Players might also draw a pirate card while trading. They then have to decide whether to rob other players - or continue as honest merchants. Players could also draw a warship card - in which case any pirate who attacks them or anyone else nearby will be in for a nasty shock! The top card in each player&rsquo;s pack shows whether they are merchants, pirates or warships. Since they don&rsquo;t show each other their cards - no-one really knows what they are (until someone decides to turn pirate by attacking another ship).<br/><br/>Players who are robbed can get their revenge by calling in the Navy and chasing the pirate down before he or she can reach Home Port! Things are made even more exciting by the &lsquo;Treasure Chest&rsquo; cards which players draw every time they roll a &lsquo;one&rsquo;. They then find out whether they have landed without any wind in the doldrums, - or been blown by a hurricane to a distant port, - or have found buried treasure - or other such twists of fortune!'<br/><br/>",

Shuffle the treasure tiles, then place them in a face-up stack on the table.<br/><br/>To start a turn, the player rolls both dice, then moves either Pirate Joe or the monkey one or two spaces clockwise (to a new island) depending on whether the pirate die shows 1-2 sabres or 1-2 bananas. She then moves Coco Capitano a number of spaces equal to the number of pips. If the captain shares a space with one of the other figures, she ends her turn empty-handed; if the captain is alone, she collects the top treasure from the stack and places it in front of her.<br/><br/>She then has the option of stopping and keeping the treasure, or of rolling the dice again. If the captain lands on an occupied space, she loses all the treasure gained this turn, placing it on the bottom of the treasure stack. She keeps taking turns until she stops or runs out of luck.<br/><br/>Once all the treasure tiles have been claimed, the game ends and players tally their scores, earning 1 point for a treasure chest, 2 for barrels, and 3 for bags. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>Variants: For younger players, ignore the points and instead see who collected the most tokens.

They found these so delicious, that they would often spend years at a time, just sitting in their towers, hardly moving at all, enjoying this delicacy.  Now and then, they would ascend to the top of their towers, and, just for the fun of it, would spit out dice in all directions out over the surrounding lands. As a result, it wasn&rsquo;t long before they were known far and wide as the Dicemouths.<br/><br/>However, one day the rain of fried dice dried up, and the Dicemouths got extremely hungry.  But they remembered all the dice that they&rsquo;d spat out in the older, better, times.  Looking around, they found that many of them had developed into full grown dice trees, covered in fresh ripe fried dice.  But when the dicemouths tried to leave their towers to pick the dice, they found that they&rsquo;d got so fat that they couldn&rsquo;t get out through the doors.  They were trapped in their own towers.<br/><br/>But just before it was too late, one of the dicemouths, who&rsquo;d saved a few dice in his tower, had a brilliant idea.  He spat out a die, just as they had always done, but this time, as the die shot out from the tower, he kept tight hold of it, and he and his tower were dragged along behind the flying die.  In this way, he managed to reach the dice trees, picked their fruit, and passed them on to all his friends, saving the race of dicemouths.<br/><br/>Soon, all the dicemouths were able to travel this way.  And they developed a race, held every year, a dice tower race.  And nowadays, every year, the winner of the race is crowned as King of the Dicemouths.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pan tu nie sta≈Ç! Demoludy is a reimplementation of a Reiner Knizia game Gem Dealer. This game is also a sequel to the game Pan tu nie sta≈Ç! (which is a Polish version of Great Wall of China).<br/><br/>The mechanics were wrapped into a theme of 70's and 80's in communist countries of eastern Europe. In this game players take a trip from Poland, travelling by popular in that time cars and try to collect a set of items bought in four (out of five) different countries. The countries presented in the game are: GDR (German Democratic Republic), Czechoslovakia, HPR (Hungarian People's Republic), Turkey and USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics).<br/><br/>Every round is an auction. The starting player takes one tile of a chosen color (country) and place it in the middle of the table. She then make a starting bid which has to contain at least one card of a matching color. The next player may present a higher bid or pass. After every bid or pass a player draws one new card from the deck and adds it to her hand. The player who already passed is omitted. The auction continues untill all but one player pass. The winner takes the tile, puts it in his car and starts a new round.<br/><br/>The first player to collect a set of four tile in different colors is the winner.<br/><br/>The game also features advanced rules. In this variant in order to win the players have to collect the four color set of tile with a value of at least 10. There are also action cards which can help to it's owner or mess up with other players' cards.<br/><br/>Demoludy vs Gem Dealer - differences<br/>- In Gem Dealer starting player receives one card less than the others. Every player gets 5 cards at the beginning of Demoludy.<br/>- In Gem Dealer there is a rule that if you lose a bidding contest while using wild card 10, you lose one of your previously gathered gem. There is no such rule in Demoludy.<br/>- There is an advanced variant in Gem Dealer in which you have to gather 5 different gems, while in advanced variant of Demoludy you need 4 different items with a total value of 10 or more.<br/>- There are no action cards in Gem Dealer which are in Demoludy.<br/>- Demoludy also contains the expansion for Pan tu nie sta≈Ç! (Great Wall of China): Bazar R&oacute;≈ºyckiego (which would be translated to: R&oacute;≈ºycki's Bazaar)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Website<br/><br/>Cyberpunk: The Collectible Card Game is a game based in the near dark future of the Cyberpunk world. The world of Cyberpunk is a world in which corporations are the elite ruling class, dark soldiers of fortune rule the streets, and everybody has a price. It is a world based very much on authors like William Gibson, Bruce Sterling, Neal Stephenson, and movies such as &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Johnny Mnemonic&quot; (which was based on a Gibson story), and &quot;The Matrix.&quot;<br/><br/>Combining the elements of these popular worlds, Cyberpunk the CCG is a game where the player sits down to play the special agenda of one of the world's ruling groups (or Sponsors.) The player brings Hackers, Gangers, Rockers, Solos, and many other characters into a cohesive team under their command and then sends them on missions (Black Ops). Once the player has scored 100 ops points by completing missions (each mission is worth a different amount of points) the player wins. However -- in this world of intrigue and backstabbing - style is just as important. A player can also win if they manage to gather 100 points of style. The final way that a player can win is through the special agenda of their sponsor; each of the seven sponsors has a different agenda.<br/><br/>2013 Edition released in December, 2003 as a limited edition; 2020 Edition released February, 2004<br/><br/>",

Each player, in turn, tries to make a sentence or phrase using the tiles in their hand and intersecting those tiles already on the 15 by 15 game board.<br/><br/>The tiles are used to make &quot;Rebus&quot; words or sentences (similar to using the letter tiles in Scrabble to make words) which are placed on the squares of the 15x15 grid game board. A Rebus is a word or sentence where a symbol replaces part of the word or sentence. For example: if you laid a tile with a picture of a letter &quot;S&quot; followed by a tile with a picture of an &quot;oar&quot; (from a rowboat) the the Rebus would read: &quot;sore&quot;.<br/><br/>The rule book comes with a description of each tile (in case you didn't know just what the picture is) as well as an example of use for each tile. These descriptions come in very handy when playing the game both for stopping player arguments as well as helping out stumped players.<br/><br/>Players score three points for each tile used. Premium squares give players bonuses. Using all eight tiles held scores a fifty point bonus.  Highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The players assume the role of monarch in ancient Egypt and attempt to influence the country's government and economy. They send merchants to the market to collect goods to develop their province, recruit workers to build pyramids, and claim fertile land on the banks of the Nile. The player who succeeds in developing his province best by cunningly making use of the privileges of the pyramids and claiming a large area on the banks of the Nile wins the game and becomes Egypt's new leader.<br/><br/>Watch out for beggars, thieves and sneaky bluffing monarchs from other provinces. They want the same as you: power over Egypt.<br/><br/>",

Problematically, several captains often show up for the same adventure.  So how shall we figure out who gets what loot?  We&rsquo;ll gamble for it of course.  That&rsquo;s the pirate way!<br/><br/>Captains Wager is a betting and hand management game which combines classic elements of poker with the kind of clever card play gamers expect from more modern card games.  It accommodates 2-5 players and plays for about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>In each round of the game players receive a hand of 4 crew cards (with values from 1-20) which they play in an attempt to win encounters by committing the highest valued card.  The crew cards also have effects which give players the opportunity to take actions in addition to providing their value towards winning the encounter.  Players who judge their hands to be strong based on their values and/or abilities can bet on them in order to increase the reward for winning.  For players unsure of their hand, but who still want to play the abilities of their crew, they can take a loan token worth minus 2 and still stay in the hand.  Players who have less confidence in their crews may fold to avoid risking their own precious gold.<br/><br/>By winning encounters players may claim treasures and items which give them special abilities and the gold necessary to win the game.  The airship pirate who has claimed the most gold at the end of the game receives the title of Pirate Admiral and declares victory over the competition.<br/><br/>",

Each player has two moves each turn. They first turn over a card. Second, they pick any face up card and move it according to chess rules. To win the game, a player must capture all of his opponents' Kings by checkmate. Once a King is captured, all the pieces from his team are removed from the board.<br/><br/>Positional Cardchess: The only difference between Cardchess and Positional Cardchess is the initial setup. In Positional Cardchess, the eight cards of highest value are placed face down on letters A, R, D, C, H, E, S and S in the same order as traditional chess.<br/><br/>Memory Cardchess: All player cards are shuffled together and placed face down on the board in a configuration which depends on the number of players. On each turn, players have two moves. They first turn over a card. The card remains face up if it is in their suit. If it isn't, the card must be clearly shown to other players so they can memorize it. Second, players move the card they just turned over or any other previously exposed card according to chess rules. To win the game, a player must capture all of his opponents' Kings by checkmate.<br/><br/>Traditional chess: The game board and cards allow to play a traditional game of chess.<br/><br/>",

In Campaign Mode, you play all seven cases in order. In Case Mode, you can play cases 2 to 6 as standalone Detective Rummy games one at a time. Since new &quot;Game Changer&quot; cards are discovered in each case in different orders (if at all) each time you play, cases will never resolve the same way twice. You can play both the campaign mode or the individual cases as many times as you like.<br/><br/>",

Teams are chosen and 13 cards dealt to each player. Then each player declares Pass or Play, depending on whether they think their team can win at least 10 of the tricks. If a player says Play in Round 1, they are the &quot;dummy.&quot; They lay all their cards down and declare which color will be trump (or no-trump). Each player then declares their hand's pip strength (small dots on some cards) and color count (largest quantity of one color in their hand). Starting on the dummy's left, cards are played. You must follow suit if you can; highest card  of the 4 wins. [Note: if no one calls play in Round 1, players will bid on how many tricks their team can win.] After 13 tricks, one team scores points as indicated on a chart. If the declaring team fails to make their bid, the opposing team scores. Play ends after four rounds.   <br/><br/><br/>",

Players then take time to sort out their hand as they want to play it. When everybody has fixed their hand, the first trick is lead. You may only play a card from either END of your hand, you may NOT re-order your hand or choose from the middle. Score the tricks you won. Each card with a Blind Hen has some eggs on it, the eggs count against you - minus one point each. But if a trick has more than one Blind Hen in it, you total the Hens and multiply with the total eggs to give the score for that trick.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is based on the ancient Chinese game of Choi Dai Di (Known as 'Big Two' in English, similar to Pusoy Dos in the Philippines).  This special deck, however, has 60 cards, instead of the standard 52, which changes (for the better) the odds of the game and increases the strategy involved.  Another difference from the classic game, is that the publishers have added a game board for keeping score, adding even more strategy, because players have choices on how to move their pawns.<br/><br/>The game starts with a round of the Golden Deuce card game - lay down higher tricks than the other players for control of the lead. Be the first player to lay down all the cards in your hand, and you gain points for all the cards left in the other players' hands.<br/><br/>Moving to the game board, each player strategically moves any of their pawns the number of spaces to match the points earned in the card game round. Players can choose to move all of their pawns around the board at once (and therefore be able to block out opponents) or move one at a time (and capitalize on the amount of spaces moved).<br/><br/>Once all players have moved, another card game round starts, and the game ends when one player has moved all of their pawns to the finish.<br/><br/>",

For 16 quarterly turns, these forces must battle across a unique map that combines area and hex movement to represent the theater  of war from Pearl Harbor to India.<br/><br/>Naval forces are organized into Task Forces, and are then moved with hidden composition to conduct such naval missions as; shore bombardment,amphibious assaults, carrier strikes and more.  Four different types of aircraft (army air, naval air, bombers, and super bombers) are operated from either Army air bases or Naval Task forces.  Ground units range from airborne brigades to Chinese Armies.<br/><br/>Despite its scope, East Wind Rain is an easily playable game that will appeal to both the wargamer and naval enthusiast alike. A simple one turn Midway scenario provides an easy to handle intro to the rules and game system. Midway, Solomons, and Marshall campaigns introduce players to the economics and planning of operations.  There is also a campaign game in which players may plan and fight the great campaign that decided the mastery of the Pacific.<br/><br/>(from the back box)<br/><br/>",

Miss and everyone else gets a shot, so players get skipped quite often.  Don't want to give up control?  Use a blocking chip to get a new turn.  The goal is to reach the Fireball in the center with no Challenge Cards.  You must play these on other players to get rid of them.  Each one has a tongue-twister, riddle, logic question, or tough knowledge bit on it.  If they're wrong, discard the question, and the next person goes.  If they are right, he or she gives you a card and you discard the played one.<br/><br/>Black Hole cards are the comedy part of the game: when you land on one, have a person read it to you and do whatever the outcome is, after everyone is finished laughing.<br/><br/>So it's a race to get rid of cards and get to the middle.

Wherever a player lands on a territory, he or she has choices to make about what actions to take, whether that be to capture the port, pay the owner a dock fee, or attempt to wrest control of the port from the current owner.  Players draw cards that have good or bad effects on the Pirate's Booty or Captain's Log spaces, and further spaces have effects on players<br/> Players gain points by holding territories, having Great Treasures, or by defeating the Commodore.

        "description": "This abstract game cleverly exploits its theme of warring spiders to introduce children to thinking games.  The board represents a web with two nests at opposite ends, and stands up between the players.  Each player uses his side of the board to move his spiders on (three small ones and a large one).  Each spider has two long flexible legs with which it steps over the web; each leg ends in a peg which fits into holes in the web.  The catch is that if you insert your peg in a hole occupied by an opponent's spider, it pushes his peg out.  A spider hanging by only one leg is a &quot;dangler&quot; and is in danger of being pushed off the web altogether (and out of the game) should the opponent push its other leg out.  Re-attaching a dangler uses up one's entire turn.<br/><br/>The object of the game is either to eliminate all of the opponent's spiders or put a leg in his nest.<br/><br/>On your turn, you move two different legs, belonging to the same or two different spiders.  The small spiders' leg span confines them to adjacent holes.  The big spider, the Daddy Long Leg, has a greater span and can use holes two spaces apart.  A move consist of detaching a leg, pivoting around the other, and plugging the free leg back in.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dread Draw is a strategy card game of press your luck competitive fortune telling.<br/><br/>Setting Up a Game:<br/>At the beginning of the game each player is dealt 10 cards face down. These cards form each player&rsquo;s Life Deck. Players can never look at the cards in their Life Deck unless the game or a card effect allows them to.<br/><br/>Playing the Game:<br/>The game is played in a series of rounds. During each round, players take turns in trying to summon cards. A round ends when only one player remains, making that player the winner of that round. A new round then begins.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each eliminated player will take damage, which is represented by discarding cards from their Life Deck. If you are eliminated and have no cards in your Life Deck, then you are defeated and are out of the game. The last player remaining in the game wins!<br/><br/>The Turn:<br/>The player who was randomly chosen to go first takes the first turn of the opening round. On your turn, you must try to summon a card. Initially, you&rsquo;ll try to summon a card from the Draw Deck, but as the game progresses you might be able to summon cards from your reserves as you accumulate them. To summon a card from the top of the Draw Deck, reveal that card. If its strength is greater than the strength of the last card you summoned, then you&rsquo;ve successfully summoned that card. Place it to the right of the last card you summoned. This is known as Escalating.<br/><br/>If you summoned the card successfully, you may use any Summon ability that it may have; though using it is entirely optional. If the card&rsquo;s strength is not greater than the last card you summoned, then discard the card you drew from the Draw Deck, and you are eliminated from the round. Discard any other cards you summoned this round.<br/><br/>After a player summons a card, or fails to summon a card, play passes to the player with the lowest total strength among their summoned cards. If there is a tie, and the current player is one of the tied players, then the current player takes the next turn. Otherwise, play passes to the next player to their left that is tied for lowest. If the Draw Deck runs out of cards, shuffle the cards in the discard pile to make a new Draw Deck.<br/><br/>Ending the Round:<br/>A round ends when only one player remains in the round. The winning player adds up the damage values of their summoned cards. Each &lsquo;Red dot&rsquo; on a summoned card represents a single damage point. Each opponent takes that much damage, starting with the player to the winner&rsquo;s left, and going around the table. Once each player has taken their damage from their Life Deck, the winner discards their summoned cards and becomes the starting player for the next round.<br/><br/>The Life Deck:<br/>Whenever you take damage, draw that many cards from your Life Deck and choose one of them to go to your reserves. Discard the other cards.<br/>If you&rsquo;re out of cards while drawing, you are still in the game &mdash; you don&rsquo;t get defeated until you take damage while having no cards in your Life Deck.<br/><br/>If an ability allows you to gain life, put that many cards from the Draw Deck on top of your Life Deck without looking at them.<br/><br/>The Reserves:<br/>Whenever you place a card in your reserves, put it next to your Life Deck so you don&rsquo;t confuse it with the cards you summon during the round. If the card has a Reserve ability, you may play it now. Whenever you must summon a card, you may choose to summon one from your reserves instead of revealing a card from the Draw Deck. You can choose any card with strength greater than the last card you summoned this round and put it to the right of that card. If it has a Summon ability, you may play it &mdash; play then passes per the normal rules.<br/><br/>Abilities:<br/>Most abilities on cards have a keyword that tells you when to play that ability. Playing summon, reserve, and aftermath abilities are always optional. <br/>Summon: Play this when you successfully summon the card.<br/>Reserve: Play this when the card is placed into your reserves, regardless of where it came from.<br/>Aftermath: Play this when you are eliminated from a round or at the end of the round that you won.<br/><br/>Cards have special abilities that do not fall under any other ability category are considered to be &ldquo;always on,&rdquo; even while they are in your reserves. These abilities are not optional.<br/><br/>Telling the Fortune:<br/>Once the game is over, if the winner had any cards left in their Life Deck, they use those cards to divine the future. That player shuffles those cards and lays them out, face-up, one at a time. The first card represents the present, the second represents the immediate future, and the rest divine the far future. It&rsquo;s up to the players to interpret what those cards mean.<br/><br/>",

This signal wants to lead you to a certain planet, but instead of space coordinates, you receive only a strange sequence of flight instructions for your spaceship.<br/><br/>Can you identify the right target planet from this signal? And what will you find when you get there?<br/><br/>During the game, you follow a signal and travel from planet to planet. Each round a different player takes the role of 'the Source' of the signal. He wants his fellow players to reach the planet from where he is sending his signal. They, as the Crew, therefore have to decode the Sources signal which he performs as a kind of flight simulation using his hand with 'taps' as stopover landings on planets on the way.<br/>In this cooperative game players loose if fuel runs out (6 incorrect guesses at the target planet), or win together if they managed to follow the signal with their rocket to 12 (different) planets.<br/>The game includes a variant for professionals, and helper cards to adjust difficulty in addition to the starting difficulty <br/>level.<br/><br/>The person giving hints can only 1) show the length of the flight by 2) how long he keeps his hand above the table<br/><br/>",

You are going to fight beak and claw with those other vultures for the sake of first dibs on dinner. But don't get too greedy, or you might wind up with little more than scraps.<br/><br/>Vulture Culture pits five or more &quot;friends&quot; against each other in a feeding frenzy free-for-all. The game takes place over five rounds, each of which represents the revelation of a fresh carcass to consume. Yummy. The vulture that escapes the scuffle with the fewest feathers ruffled will enjoy the privilege of prime pickings among the tasty treats available. Conversely, the most beat-up buzzards develop an attitude adjustment, which just might earn them the edge next time around.<br/><br/>Every round, each player receives the same three actions: one each of Attack, Avoid, and Assist. Each round consists of a series of Attacks which take place without a conventional turn order. Attackers choose the strength of their attack, but increasing the strength makes it increasingly likely that the attack will miss its intended target and strike another bird instead. Additionally, every Attack presents an opportunity for all players to Assist with the devious deed at hand, or Avoid taking damage should events go awry. The catch? Every action can be played only once. You can block any one Attack and take no damage, but that leaves you vulnerable for any other actions that occur that round. Success requires roughly equal parts of clever hand management and deft social manipulation.<br/><br/>Vulture Culture was created to combine the thrill of thematic games like Munchkin and Cosmic Encounter with the mechanically-minded strategic sensibility of eurogames like Power Grid and 7 Wonders, all in less than an hour.<br/><br/>",

Those stacks consist of 2 different card types: Material and Action. To get better material cards, you need the right action cards on your hand to counter certain effects and be able to take the materials on your hand. Material cards from your hand can be built into a nest by playing them on the table in front of you. A nest consists of a maximum of 6 cards. Goal of the game is to score as many points as possible with different combinations of cards in your nest.<br/><br/>Another option to get the cards you need is to trade with other players, but not in a direct way. Depending on the number of players there are some cards available as an exchange stack. Players can trade cards from their hand with the exchange stack.<br/><br/>Each material card has one of three types, one of four themes and an individual value between 1 and 3. To build the perfect nest you require 2 cards of each type, preferably of the same theme and with an individual value as high as possible.<br/><br/>The game ends when one of the adventure card stacks is used up or one of the Dodo characters has lost all of its hit points.<br/><br/>Dodoresque consists of 90 cards, over 60 of them with unique artworks of our Dodos and their adventures.<br/><br/>Dodoresque: Jungle Fever can be combined with Dodoresque: Cherry Blossom to be played with up to 8 Players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To win you must be totally sane after a fixed number of turns. This is quite difficult, so the player with less &quot;insanity points&quot; will win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The objective of the game is to get from start to finish by solving the clues on the question cards. Each player moves along the track on one wedge (1/8 slice) of the board, towards the center.<br/><br/>One player takes a card and reads the category (Place / Events / Person / Thing / Side Track) and the clues one at a time, and other players try to guess the answer. The six clues on a card may be read in any order. The clue reader may give the hardest/most vague clue first.<br/><br/>The fewer clues you need, the farther you will move forward. Players move ahead seven minus the number of clues read before they gave the answer. If a player only needed one clue, they move six spaces. If they needed all six clues, they move one space. The player who solved the clue becomes the next clue reader. If no one solved the card, it passes to the left.<br/><br/>Players have two free guesses at the beginning of their score track, and one free guess once they enter the red zone. After that, they move back one space for each incorrect guess.<br/><br/>If a player lands on a space with a triangle, they draw a Venture card and follow the instructions. If they land on a red space with an arrow, they fall back to the space indicated.<br/><br/>The first player to reach the center of the board wins. It does not have to be by exact count.<br/><br/>",

NOIRE &ndash; the first voice-controlled murder mystery board game<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s been a murder in the small town of St. Noire &ndash; and the killer has promised to strike again! Can you solve the mystery before time runs out and the killer gets away? Find the clues, question suspects and trust absolutely no one. Someone is lying, and if you&rsquo;re going to crack the case, you&rsquo;ll need to figure out who&hellip;your move, Detective.&quot;<br/><br/>St. Noire is an Alexa-enabled physical board game. Therefore you will need an Alexa device to play the game.<br/><br/>The premise of the game is similar to Clue in that a murder has been committed, and the players are attempting to deduce the identity of the murderer, the weapon, and the location.<br/><br/>However, the execution and mechanics are significantly different than Clue as seen in the &quot;How to Play&quot; section below from the publisher.<br/><br/>Of note, Nolan Bushnell, one of the co-designers of St. Noire, also co-founded Atari Inc. (Pong, Atari 2600, et.al). He is also credited with Bushnell's Law which posits games will be rewarding if they are &quot;easy to learn and difficult to master.&quot;<br/><br/>How to play, from the publisher's site:<br/>&quot;Pay close attention&hellip; You only have 'til the end of night seven to solve the case.<br/><br/>To deduce who the killer is, explore the different locations in town to find the right murder weapon, and confirm suspects' whereabouts on the night of the murder.<br/><br/>Not everyone will give an HONEST answer when asked where they were or who they saw the night of the murder. Compare suspect&rsquo;s answers and look for inconsistencies to figure out who is telling the truth and who is lying. Be careful -- liars will always lie, but not all liars are the killer! Nothing they say can be trusted!<br/><br/>On every turn you can choose to either:<br/><br/>Examine a location for evidence.<br/>Choose to question a townsperson about where they were and who they saw on the night of the murder.<br/>Accuse a suspect.<br/>To win the game, identify and accuse the correct suspect before the end of night seven. The killer is caught. You save the town.<br/><br/>Lose the game by making two incorrect accusations or making an incorrect accusation at the end of night seven. The killer skips town.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The person telling the story can also choose to answer with &ldquo;Not Important&rdquo; if players start getting too far off track.<br/><br/>Mind Maze allows players to test their skills of deduction and investigation, and to get to the bottom of the mystery with as few questions as possible. Players take turns asking questions, and lose a point for every question they ask. Points can be gained by asking specific key questions which also help players to figure out the true version of the story. This encourages players to think carefully about the questions they ask and to work together.<br/><br/>",

There&rsquo;s only one thing to do &ndash; Fling Poo, in zero-gravity!<br/> Space Poo is a fast-paced game where players take on the role of monkeys on a space station in the middle of a poo fight. Your goal is to be the last monkey standing, who is also the cleanest one. Each turn, each player gets to draw and play a card, usually to either fling poo or clean himself off.  Out of turn, players have the opportunity to play cards to foil other players' poo flinging.  If you get covered in too much poo, you're out of the game and the last monkey standing wins.  But watch out! Things can go wrong on the station and they spell disaster if you don&rsquo;t deal with them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Some may know the classic White Elephant gift exchange game as Yankee Swap, Dirty Santa, Thieving Secret Santa, or Parcel Pass. The White Elephant Card Game simulates this classic holiday game in a quick, light family card game.<br/><br/>In the White Elephant Card Game you play the part of a no-good cheapskate, unwilling to spend a measly dime on the people on your gift list. However, you will be attending several White Elephant parties. You can take some junk from your attic and exchange it for treasures to give as gifts. If you &ldquo;play your cards right&rdquo; you could fill your gift list for free and no one will be the wiser!<br/><br/>Each player has a Gift List Card, a list of three people for whom to acquire gifts. The Gift Cards in their hand constitute their &ldquo;attic&rdquo;. There is one &ldquo;White Elephant Party&rdquo; for each card in a player&rsquo;s attic.<br/><br/>For each &ldquo;party&rdquo; a player &ldquo;brings a gift to the party&rdquo; by placing one Gift Card from their hand facedown on the table in front of them. The first player begins by selecting one of the gifts and &ldquo;opens&rdquo; it by turning it face up. The next player may then select a new gift, or &ldquo;steal&rdquo; an opened gift by taking a face-up Gift Card from a player who has an open gift. When a player steals an open gift they hold it in their hand until a new gift is opened. This way a gift may be stolen only once until a new card is turned over. When a new card is turned over all stolen gift cards are placed face up so the next player may steal any opened gift.<br/><br/>This continues until the last gift is opened. At this point each player keeps the gift they have and a new party begins. This continues until all of the Gift Cards have been played. At the end of the game each player counts only the one highest-numbered Gift Card they received that matches each color on their gift list. The total of these cards is the player&rsquo;s final score. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

You will have to be clever to estimate the number of outlaws needed to attack &ndash; and watch out for the Sheriff and your opponents!<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. Each round, players bid on the right to perform the next bank robbery by placing a number of outlaws in the center of the playing area; each player starts with eight outlaws. Alternatively a player can skip the round or postpone an attack until after other players bid, but doing so will cause one or more of his outlaws to become wounded. When a player bids outlaws, the sheriff token moves a number of city tiles equal to the number of outlaws bid (in most cases). If a sheriff lands on a player's Chief of the Outlaws token &ndash; as these tokens are located on city tiles and not used for bidding &ndash; one of that player's outlaws is wounded.<br/><br/>The winner of the bid attacks a city, most likely netting him gold and possibly giving him new outlaws (as they are freed from that city's prison), but which city is attacked is determined by the difference between the winning bid and the lowest bid. Thus, bids from the other players will influence the winner's gains &ndash; and if the winner lands on the city tile where the sheriff is located, he gets nothing. The player with the second highest bid attacks the stagecoach and gains one silver.<br/><br/>If a player claims something from a city tile, it's flipped over and now has a different power for the remainder of the game, allowing a player who lands on the tile to steal gold or silver cubes from an opponent or wounding one of that player's outlaws. After each round, players collect the outlaws they used to bid and &quot;wound&quot; the healthy outlaws by flipping them over to their wounded side. A wounded outlaw who is wounded again is removed from the game. (Prisoners come into the game wounded, so they can be used only once.)<br/><br/>The game ends when no player has any outlaws remaining or all players refuse to bid in a given round. The player who has collected the most gold and silver wins!<br/><br/>",

The first player chooses the color of his gear (silver or copper), which will remains his color for the rest of the game.<br/>At your turn, you draw a card, and place one card from your hand. These two phases (drawing and placing) are mandatory.<br/><br/>Below the type of the cards:<br/><br/>    Padlock : cannot be rotated, even by a joker card<br/>    Rotation : identified by their arrows. Allow the player to rotate one adjacent card by a quarter turn in the arrow direction<br/>    Joker : purple cards. They bear both colors. When placed, they allow the player to rotate any card by a quarter turn. The color association between gears must always be respected when placing them.<br/><br/><br/>When placing a card, you are free to decide whether to use its power or not.<br/><br/>",

The player with the most influence counters at an oracle can take either the points for the oracle or the spell card there. The player with the second most influence gets whichever the first player didn't take. Spells have one-time effects that alter different aspects of the game.<br/><br/>Influence is gained at the oracles both by playing cards and rolling a die. This gives a mix of random chance and control over the game. If a player tries to get influence in a position occupied by another player's influence counter, they must duel. This is a RPS mechanic with a twist. If both players choose an &quot;earthbeast&quot; in the duel, the defender wins.<br/><br/>When all oracles are scored, the player with the most total votes wins.<br/><br/>This is a reworking of Reiner Knizia's Vegas. Maginor adds some cards, spells, and a different &quot;dueling&quot; mechanic.<br/><br/>",

The other player(s) become the mob. The mob divides one hundred mob tokens as evenly as possible. One mob player, acting as host, reads a question and its three possible answers aloud. The mob players use their tokens to secretly choose one or more answers.<br/><br/>When the mob players have finished distributing all of their tokens, the contestant may ask for one of three helps before giving a response to the question. The helps one response of the contestant&rsquo;s choosing), Trust the Mob (the contestant is forced to choose whichever response has the most tokens on it) or Ask the Mob (this eliminates one wrong response). The contestant can use each help only once.<br/><br/>If the contestant gives the correct response, the money is added to the bank equal to the level the player is on multiplied by the number of tokens the mob has put on the wrong responses. The levels start at $1000 and ascend to $10,000. The mob tokens that are on the incorrect responses are out of play.<br/><br/>The game is over when the contestant gives an incorrect response. This means the money in the bank is divided among the mob players who still have tokens.  The contestant wins $1,000,000 when the mob loses all its tokens. The contestant can quit the game before ascending to the next level and keep whatever money has been accumulated in the bank.<br/><br/>Players continue the game until each player has been the contestant. A running total of the scores of each game is kept. The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>Considering that the television series uses 101 contestants, this is reasonable faithful translation of the television series.<br/><br/>Intended for 2 - 4 players Ages 12 and up<br/><br/>",

Each player gets three town cards of identical strength and five randomly dealt hero cards with values ranging from 1 to 5. Players are dealt hands of five action cards they can use to attack players towns and heroes or to strengthen their own heroes and towns. Gold cards are also in the action deck which allow players to bolster the value of an attack card. Battling players each roll a die and add the  scores of either their attack and gold cards (for the attacker) or the hero/town and training cards (for the defender). Play is simple and quick for a battle card game. The randomly assigned heroes can create unfair situations, however.<br/><br/>",

Then you draw exactly three butt groups from the butt bag. Once you have drawn all the butts from the butt bag, you choose which one butt group you want to score. Not only you yourself though but everybody will get butt points for each of their butts in the butt group that you are scoring. The next player will then add a random special butt to the butt bag before they, too, draw all the butts. These change the game up a little but, more importantly, each player butt is also worth an additional butt point for each special butt that is in play.<br/><br/>Once you reach at least 28 butt points, the game ends with the next reset. A reset happens either because a player decides against adding another special butt to the bag or because there happens to be one or more special butts in each of the three butt groups that a player draws.

With a little luck, you'll make your mark on history! Each player's turn comprises of either buying or selling from three Store Cards (Saloon, Mercantile, and Gunsmith)and using Rations to gain Stamina. Once that part of the turn is completed, 1 card is revealed (based on Notoriety gained throughout the deck)from the massive 173 card deck. There are four card types within the deck: Duel Cards, Critter Cards, Range Cards, and Calamity Cards. Depending on what is revealed, you might have to use your bullets to defeat a Duel Card or Critter Card, you might have to forfeit supplies or cards when a Calamity is encountered, and you might gain supplies when a Range Card is revealed. The game ends when all 9 Duel Cards have been defeated or when every other player has died. Then each player calculates their Bounty! Highest Bounty wins!<br/><br/>",

Played cards are placed on the table next to previously placed cards. The new card has to be of an immediately higher or lower value and of the same suit, or it has to be of the same value and from another suit. Players can only play 1 card per turn. A joker card can be played at any time and at any place while a 'give or take 2 card' (used to have another player take 1 or 2 extra cards or to remove 1 or 2 cards from the table) can be played at any time except as a player's last card. When a 'give or take 2 card' is played it goes back into the stack of cards and the stack is shuffled again. The first player to have no card left wins.<br/><br/>",

Be the last player in the game to become the 'sole' survivor.<br/><br/>- - - - - - - -<br/><br/>And adopted from their guide on how to teach the game:<br/><br/>- Players sit in a circle<br/>- Place the little plastic sneakers in the middle of the table, one less than the number of players<br/>- Shuffle the cards and deal 4 to each player<br/>- Players simultaneously select a card from their hand and place it face-down to their left (last player is creating a discard pile with his selected cards)<br/>- Players then simultaneously pick up the card to their right (first player takes from the draw pile)<br/>- Goal is to obtain an hand of 4 cards all of the same value<br/>- Wilds can be used for any card value to create four of a kind<br/>- When a player collects a 4-of-a-kind set, he grabs a sneaker from the middle of the table.  Then all other players can take a sneaker, regardless of what is in their hand<br/>- If draw pile is exhausted, dealer shuffles discard stack to become the new draw pile<br/>- The player who did not get a sneaker receives a penalty letter &ndash; S.<br/>- As rounds continue and players spell S-N-E-A-K-S from penalties.  When a player completes the word SNEAKS, they are eliminated from the game and 1 sneaker is removed from the center of the table<br/>- The last player in the game is the WINNER!<br/><br/>- - - - - - - -<br/><br/>I assume that the &quot;dealer&quot; (first player in the chain) shifts from round to round, otherwise they'll get all the wild cards that aren't dealt out at the beginning).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Dragon Stripes, players test their luck as a knight approaching a dragon, with the knight trying to pick up as many gems as possible along the way. (In an earlier version of the game, Die Augen der Kali, players moved a figure toward the goddess Kali, collecting gems as they move.)<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with 40 gems. Shuffle the deck of 51 cards: 38 footprint cards, 10 stop cards, and 3 danger cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player places the knight before the first stripe on the dragon's tail, then reveals the top card of the deck. If they reveal a footprint card, they advance the knight this many stripes toward the dragon's head, then place gems next to the knight equal to the number on the current stripe (which range from 1 to 17). The player then decides to either reveal another card or hold. In the latter situation, other players can offer to take over the current player's turn by paying them a bounty based on the number of gems currently next to the knight. If someone takes over the turn, they must reveal at least one card as the new active player; if no one does, the current active player collects all of the gems, then the next player takes their turn.<br/><br/>If the active player reveals a stop card, they lose 1/4 of their gems (rounding down), then the knight retreats to the dragon's tail and the next player takes their turn.<br/><br/>The first time the active player reveals a danger card, this is treated as a stop. The second danger card is also treated as a stop, but the penalty for being stopped now (and by future stop cards) is 1/2 of your gems. The reward, however, is that each time the knight moves forward, the number of gems placed next to it doubles.<br/><br/>Dragon Stripes ends one of two ways: Either a player reveals the third danger card, which causes them to lose all of their gems, or a player moves the knight past the 17th stripe to the dragon's head, at which point they claim all gems that remain in the dragon's hoard. Either way, whoever has the most gems at this point wins.<br/><br/>",

The Castle of each player sits in the nearest right corner of the board.<br/>The first player that captures an adversary Castle (or conquers the last piece of one colour) wins , thus ending game.<br/><br/>Turn action: movement and capture<br/><br/>On his turn, a player can move one of his square-shaped pieces. All the pieces (but the Castle, which as said before can not be moved) are equal to each other. Each of them can move in 4 diferent ways, according to the side of the piece facing &ldquo;north&rdquo;, north being defined as &ldquo;forward&rdquo; from the POV of the owner of the piece. So for example &ldquo;north&rdquo; for the player sitting on the east side of table will be westward, wile for the player sitting on the north side of the table it will be southward, and so on.<br/><br/>On his turn the player can move one of his pieces in one of these <br/>2 ways:<br/>    - just rotate the piece in place (thus changing the piece movement<br/>            type for the next time he will decide to move it);<br/>    - move the piece and then (optionally) rotate it;<br/><br/>A player can capture other players' pieces by moving one of his piece on a square occupied by an opponent's piece. Pieces can never &ldquo;go through&rdquo; or &ldquo;jump over&rdquo; other pieces, both of the same or different colours.<br/><br/>Each piece can be oriented in four different ways (one per each side of the piece) enabling it to four different kind of movement.<br/><br/>The active roles is the one facing &ldquo;north&rdquo;.<br/><br/>These are the four roles a piece can assume:<br/><br/>- Warrior:<br/>        it moves 1 square and can't go backwards, in other words it can<br/>        move to one of the 5 squares adjacent to it (W, NW, N, NE, E);<br/>- Blade:<br/>        it moves 1 or 2 square &ldquo;forward&rdquo; (N);<br/>- Catapult:<br/>        it can move up to 3 squares diagonally going only forward, as<br/>        usual (NE, NW);<br/>- Shield:<br/>        the only role that can go backwards, it can move up to 2 squares<br/>        going South or just 1 square going diagonally (SW or SE).<br/><br/>Begining of the game<br/><br/>The first player to move will be the one opening the table. Then it will be the player on his left the one to move, and so on, going clockwise.<br/><br/>We advise you not to distract from what the other players do: you can lose the game even if an enemy don't conquer your Castle (one wins, all others lose).<br/><br/>",

Be careful: triggering an alarm, lollygagging around or sticking your nose in the wrong crate can open up a whole world of ugly - be it Reavers, Alliance, or the sinister Hands of Blue!<br/><br/>Fail and it&rsquo;s all over... but succeeding means you and your crew walk away with more than a fistful of credits!<br/><br/>",

During the game, players accuse one another through confidential markers, which send others to death through family trial.

The other players simply move a pawn on the board and are awarded points by the priestess based on how their actions (including seemingly irrelevant ones like body movement or tone of voice) correspond with the rules. At the end of a round the priestess receives the same score as the highest-scoring adept, encouraging her to make the rules difficult but not impossible to guess.<br/><br/>",

The harder the target is to claim, the more points that card is worth.<br/><br/>To set up the game, shuffle the 45 target cards, then lay them out face up in stacks of 15 in the three card trays. On a turn, a player can roll the dice up to three times, setting aside any dice that she wants to keep after each of the first two rolls. If a player could claim a target card after the first or second roll &ndash; such as a card showing three-of-a-kind &ndash; but decides to roll again, she can no longer claim that card after a future roll. Once a player claims a card, her turn ends and the next player goes, rolling all six dice to start the turn.<br/><br/>If a player doesn't claim a card, however, the next player has the option of immediately claiming a card that matches the dice previously set aside or keeping those dice set aside and having only two rolls on his turn to try to claim a card.<br/><br/>Some cards have icons that allow whoever wins it to take a special action, such as a bonus turn or theft of a card from an opponent.<br/><br/>After a player has claimed a certain number of cards (4, 5 or 7 with four-to-six, three or two players), that player can decide to end the game. The game ends automatically once a player has claimed six, eight or ten cards (again, based on the number of players).

        "description": "Walk the Plank is a fast-moving card game for three to nine players, ages eight and up. The object is to win the most battles in any given round to become Captain for the next round. But be careful &ndash; if you don&rsquo;t win ANY battles in a round, you&rsquo;re out of the game. You&rsquo;re dealt fewer cards in each successive round, and the player who wins the final round wins the game! Play is fast and furious, with an average game time of only 10 minutes.<br/><br/>Walk the Plank comes with a deck of 68 cards. The deck has sixty-five numbered cards, two Walk the Plank! cards, and one Sea Monster! card. The sixty-five numbered cards are divided into five suits: Doubloons, Hookhands, Monkeys, Parrots, and Peglegs. The cards in each suit are numbered 1 through 13, with 1 worth the least and 13 worth the most.<br/><br/>The first dealer, or Captain, deals 7 cards to each player in the first round of seven. Subsequent rounds deal one less card. (Round 2 is 6 cards, Round 3 is 5 cards, etc.) The Captain then turns over the top card on the deck so that everyone may see it. The suit of the card revealed will be trump for the first round. The trump suit is the most powerful suit in any given battle. For example, if Monkeys are trump, then a low card in Monkeys will beat even a higher-numbered card in any other suit. If the card the Captain turns over is a Walk the Plank! or a Sea Monster!, there is no trump suit for this first round. In every round after the first, whoever is Captain chooses the trump suit after looking at his or her cards.<br/><br/>The suit of the first card played in a battle is called the current suit. If this card is a numbered card, it may or may not be from the trump suit. If the first card played in a battle is one of the three special cards, there is no current suit for that battle, but each player still has to play one card.<br/><br/>You must play a card of the same suit as the first card played in each battle, if you can. We call this following suit. So if you have any cards in your hand of the same suit as the first one played in a battle, you have to pick one and play it. You don&rsquo;t have to follow suit if you have no cards in the current suit. You don&rsquo;t have to follow suit if you have a special card (Walk the Plank! or Sea Monster!), unless you choose not to play the special card.<br/><br/>Walk the Plank! will win any battle, beating even the highest card in the trump suit&mdash;think of it as a &ldquo;wild card&rdquo; worth one more than the highest card in play. When someone plays Sea Monster!, no one wins the battle, no matter what cards<br/>have been played. The player who played Sea Monster! doesn't win the battle, but he/she does gain control. (So he/she gets to choose the current suit for the next battle by playing the first card.)<br/><br/>The player who wins the battle in the round becomes the Captain in the next round, which means you get to play the first card in the next battle.<br/><br/>If you win one or more battles in a round in which no other player wins a battle, you win the game!<br/><br/>",

The Allies are gathered to attempt their breakout and begin the race toward the German frontier. Each player has Combat Units and Headquarters available, and is capable of maneuvering across the map and engaging enemy pieces in combat. You must master the deceptively concise rules for Activation and Movement Point expenditure. And at any given time, you will face the decision of which army to Activate in any one phase - and your opponent will have an immediate opportunity to react . The most interesting aspect of the game is that it seriously tries to model time over the course of the player's turn. You activate HQs, which can then control a varying number of infantry or armor units, depending on nationality. There is a track display that you use during movement/combat. As you make decisions about which actions to take, you branch along the track, limiting your options about what you can do next. Essentially this captures the passage of time required for certain actions. It's easier to play than it is to describe.  For example, suppose you have an armor division near the enemy and a couple of infantry divisions further away. If you move up the infantry to attack and make a breakthrough, the armored unit will probably not be able to move very far through the breach. In effect, the armored unit has spent most of the turn waiting around for the infantry to get in position and make its attack.  The game puts emphasis on elite units on both sides and on the brittleness of the powerful British formations (no replacements).

The first player plays any card, then calls &quot;Higher&quot; or &quot;Lower&quot;; the next player must play an appropriate card or pass, laying down her cards and stepping out of the round. Instead of playing higher or lower, however, a player can play a card of the same value, saying &quot;Double up&quot;, which forces all subsequent players to also play a card of the same value.<br/><br/>Two escape valves exist in the game: A player can always play a 7 &mdash; the large joker &mdash; no matter what was played previously, with this player calling out &quot;Higher&quot; or &quot;Lower&quot; as normal. A player can play a 1 &mdash; the small joker &mdash; no matter whether &quot;Higher&quot; or &quot;Lower&quot; was called, but a 1 can't be played on doubled cards; the 1 can itself be doubled, with only a 7 being able to break the doubling.<br/><br/>As soon as all but one player have passed for the round, the round ends and the lone player still in the round receives one point for each played card. A round might also end by players running out of cards in hand, but the final card played in a round that ends this way cannot be a joker (unless a joker was also the next-to-last card). Once a round ends, players have the option to ditch their hand, after which everyone refills their hand to seven cards and a new round begins.<br/><br/>The first player to have at least sixty points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each card is illustrated with shapes and numbers.  The game play is simple - just match the shape or number on your card with the shape or number on the previous card.  The first player to get rid of all their cards is the winner! Like Uno without the special cards!<br/><br/>There are five suits: stars, circles, squares, crosses and triangles. You can change suit by laying the same number as has been laid in the suit you lay down yourself. Also, the card numbered 20 (WHOT Card) can be used to change from a suit to any other suit at any time.  When the first person has finished, the others count up how many penalty points they have on the cards they have left in their hand. (Star cards count double as indicated by the second smaller figure in the small star). More recent decks also give the suits different colours, stars are blue, circles yellow, crosses red, triangles green, and squares purple.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Whot! was invented (but, apparently, not patented) and trademarked by William Henry Storey, of Southend-on-Sea, England in 1935. It was first marketed by the company Storey &amp; Co of Croydon, which he set up in 1930, but was soon acquired by Waddingtons of Leeds, and was popular in Britain in the 1950s and 1960s.&rsquo;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At first you think you are playing good old Monopoly where they just add some extra buildings to give a little twist. But the longer you play, the more you realise they actually made a whole new game. You start with more money than usual, which gives you the idea you will last longer (with a bit of luck maybe). The fact that now you can build right away when you bought a property, gives so much dynamic to the game. No more waiting until you have the whole set, or not having the set because one player refuses to trade. Even with a couple of single properties you can win the game.<br/><br/>But not so fast. Everybody wants to win of course. And with the 80 extra buildings they added to the game, nothing was ever so uncertain. On every property you can build residential or industrial buildings. The first is not protected against negative buildings (hazards) and requires positive buildings otherwise the property becomes worthless. The industrial buildings on the other hand are protected but they cost twice as much! So you will have to make choice. And the added electronic device will, besides timing deals, always indicate how many buildings you can exactly make.<br/><br/>There is also no community chest anymore, only chance. But they have changed the content of the cards which makes the game less predictable and more fun to play- watch your buildings being crushed because of an earthquake or not getting your rent because a player evades the number thrown with the dice.<br/><br/>Besides these changes, there are many more twists to the game which I will not reveal here but be sure that they all add to the greatness that once was and that now has even become better.<br/><br/>Monopoly City made its first public appearance at the Nuremberg Toy Fair 2009.<br/><br/>",

Players assume the role of one of two great warlords - Lord Forseti and Lord Gorganun. Forseti has more powerful units; his armies are the greatest in the world, and they fight much better than Lord Gorganun's. However, Lord Gorganun has a magical edge. He controls more powerful wizards than does Lord Forseti, and he can gain allies in the magical fairy people known as the Cadmin and the mighty dragon, Terromax. What Forseti has in military strength, Gorganun makes up for in total available units and magical prowess.<br/><br/>",

Players may travel from class to class in order to learn more powerful spells with which to duel opponents or they may venture to the common areas of Hogwarts and procure magical items that may help during a duel.<br/><br/>Each player takes a mover (Harry, Hermione, Ron or Malfoy) and a matching spell book. When a player enters a classroom, they may take a spell card and load it into their spell book. Each player can perform every spell, but some students are more proficient than others with certain spells. The Spell Books &quot;de-code&quot; the spells and tells players how well their characters can cast spells.<br/><br/>But be forewarned, students can only duel in the designated dueling club area in the center of the board. If players challenge each other outside of the dueling club, they may test their skills in one of three wizard games.<br/><br/>Be the first player to defeat all other players in the dueling club and be the ultimate wizard!<br/><br/>",

They are based in a mining town, from where they venture out into the surrounding wild territory.  When a player strikes it lucky, he stakes his claim and rushes back to the town to register it.  A registered claim becomes a Mine and its owner collects gold nuggets every time he lands on it.  He will try and carry his nuggets back to the Bank and on the way the other players challenge him and may rob him of his gold.  The first player to get five nuggets to the Bank is the winner.<br/><br/>From the box:<br/><br/>Goldrush is a game for 2, 3 or 4 players and takes about one hour to play.  The rules are simple to follow and luck and skill are well blended to make it enjoyable for each member of the family or children of different ages on their own.<br/><br/>When you play Goldrush the fun starts from the from the first move.  You re-live a time of high adventure when reckless men staked all they had on one lucky strike.

        "description": "The first thing you should know about Granjeros is that it belongs to a new breed of games, the &quot;B Games&quot; family. B Games seek to teach values and principles about building a more fair and sustainable world, in a fun way. Some of these principles are: Acknowledging a new meaning of success, promoting collaboration, environmental awareness and protection, and social development among others.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>The game is a 4 to 5 player game where each player is a farmer who has come to a land full of opportunities to develop in a sustainable manner plots of land. Although each player is competing with other players to win the game, collaboration, trust and and holistic approach to growth are quintessential to progressing in the game. Thus players compete and collaborate with each other as well as become accountable as a group for the common resources that impact the whole system. The game ends when one or more players reach a total of 7 B points. Yes!, in a Granjeros game there can be one or more winning players simultaneously.<br/><br/>Granjeros is a turn based game fashioned under European style boardgames. That means that although one player holds his turn, other players play along actively while not in their turn. There is always something to do wether you it is your turn or not.  The central hexagon is where the water well is located. The water well is a key element of Granjeros gameplay as it influences all players in every turn and will determine the conditions for harvesting and selling crops. Inside the water well you will find 7 water buckets.<br/><br/>Each turn has the following structure &amp; steps:<br/><br/>a) Take a bucket of water out of the well (put it in front of you).<br/>b) Throw the 8 harvest dice. Check for &quot;pairs&quot; of vegetable/fruits.<br/>c) For every pair, reward each player the corresponding vegetable/fruits and number according the type of plot he has [orchard, barn, farm or industry].<br/>d) Invest resources [land, technology, farmers, seed] to develop your plots either individually or in collaboration with other players.<br/>e) Negotiate and dialogue with other players to plan for future developments. <br/>Regardless that it is somebody else's turn all players are entitled to negotiate and dialogue at all times during the game.<br/><br/>Every time you evolve your plots, either individually or collaboratively, to higher level of development you will earn B points. First player(s) to reach 7 B points win the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "INTRODUCTION:<br/>Table Land is populated by humans, dwarfs, elves, orcs and barbarians. It is a world in permanent war for the control of the territory. Play and become a true Lord of Tierra Mesa by beating your rivals.<br/><br/>AIM OF THE GAME:<br/>The aim of the game is to achieve, before the other players, a combination of 5 cards with the same value, or to form an army with 5 consecutive cards of the same race or where each value accords a different race (Unbeatable Run).<br/><br/>You will become Lord of Table Land in several ways:<br/>1.    Gathering together an army of 5 consecutive cards (run) of the same race.<br/>2.    Gathering together 5 cards of the same value (archers, princesses, catapults&hellip;)<br/>3.    And finally, the Unbeatable Run; you can get an army alliance gathering 5 consecutive cards of a different race each.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who gathers one of these combinations.<br/><br/>BEFORE THE GAME:<br/>-    Shuffle the cards.<br/>-    Hand out 5 cards to each player.<br/>-    Allocate the deck of cards facing down, in the middle of Table Land.<br/>-    The first game starts with the player who owns most hairs in his ears, continuing then, in a clockwise direction. The following games are started by the winner of the previous game.<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been distributed to the players the game stars. The player that starts the game draws one card from the central deck, looks at it, and gets rid of the card which is not convenient for him. Each player should always have 5 cards.<br/><br/>Each player discards should be placed on Table Land, ALWAYS in front of the player, creating a deck where the last discarded card is shown. This way there should be as many discarded decks as players.<br/><br/>When a player gets rid of a card and puts it on its deck facing up, any interested player can take it. How? The interested player should cover it with its hand. The fastest player covering the deck is the one that gets the card. This player should then discard one of his cards. Then, the game continues in a clockwise direction starting from him.<br/><br/>This way the game continues until one of the players gathers 5 cards with the same value or 5 consecutive cards of the same race or the Unbeatable Run. The player should let the other players know during his turn by placing the discard card facing down and by showing his 5 wining cards, he gains the victory by beating his rivals.<br/><br/>WINING COMBINATIONS:<br/><br/>Option 1 &ndash; Whoever wins 5 games is the winner of the whole game.<br/><br/>Option 2 &ndash; After each game all card points must be counted, except those from the winner, being 100 points those from the action cards. The player with fewer points after 5 games is the winner.<br/><br/>Option 3 &ndash; After each game only the winner&rsquo;s points must be counted, in this situation the value (each value corresponds to a different race) of the Unbeatable Run is three times the addition of the values. The game finishes when one of the players reaches 1000 points or a previously agreed quantity.<br/><br/>These are not the only possibilities, players can agree on other options for victory.<br/><br/>ACTION CARDS:<br/><br/>This game has a series of action cards which are used for the interaction between players to threaten their rivals:<br/><br/>Skull (2 cards): If a player places this card on the other player&rsquo;s deck it means that all his troops have been killed. He must place all his cards, facing down, beneath the central deck and draw 5 new cards.<br/><br/>card swap (1 card): If a player places this card in another player&rsquo;s deck, both players must swap one card.<br/><br/>hand swap (1 card): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that you swap your hand of cards with that player.<br/><br/>steal 2 cards for the deck (2 cards): Placing this card on to other player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the attacking card) randomly takes 2 cards from the other player&rsquo;s hand, and then this player must immediately pick up two new cards from the central deck. The 2 cards that have been taken from the player&rsquo;s hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.<br/><br/>steal 3 cards for the deck (1 card): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 3 cards from his rival&rsquo;s hand. Then, the rival should draw 3 new cards from the central deck. The cards taken from his hand must be placed beneath the central deck without looking at them.<br/><br/>steal a card (3 cards): Placing this card in another player&rsquo;s discard deck means that the player who has placed the card (the assailant) randomly takes 1 card from his rival&rsquo;s hand, and keeps it. Now the victim has 4 cards, therefore he must pick up a new card to have 5. The assailant has now 6 cards therefore he must discard one of them to have 5 again to continue the battle.<br/><br/>Potion (2 cards): the joker substitutes any other card concerning value and race. It can NOT be used as action card. One player can have on its hand up to two jokers.<br/><br/>FAQs:<br/><br/>- Which discard cards can I pick up? You can only pick up the last card that has been placed at the top of the discard deck from the player that&rsquo;s on its turn.<br/><br/>- After an action card who continues? The player next to the player who has discarded the Action Card, always clockwise.<br/><br/>- Do runs or the Unbeatable Run have to start from number 5? Runs do not have to start from 5, as long as they are always consecutive numbers.<br/><br/>- What should it be done if the extension of Tierra Mesa cannot be cover and a player does not reach their rivals discard decks? Instead of hunting the card with the hand you should scream Guar!!! The one that screams it first takes the card.<br/><br/>- Can I draw one card from any discard deck while other player is drawing a card from the central deck? When a player picks up a card from the central deck the possibility of taking a card from a discard deck is blocked.<br/><br/>- If I take a card from a discard deck, can the card that appears underneath be taken later on? NO. Those cards were previously played, therefore, you should pay attention!!<br/><br/>- What should it be done when the central deck finishes?

        "description": "Massilia the beautiful &ndash; its strategic location on the Mediterranean has made it an important trading port of the Roman Empire, bringing prosperity to the city. Its market has become one of the most popular on the coast, and merchants are fighting to be able to install their stalls. Competition is tough to make a fortune, especially since the customer is demanding. This requires having well-stocked stalls to attract the wealthy customers and increase its reputation. But be careful not to incur the wrath of the consul as this could cost you. However, you can always count on the gods and goddesses to give you a boost, with, of course, some offerings. And yes, everything is paid in this world ...<br/><br/>In Massilia, each player will be able to use different colored dice to perform actions. There are four different colors corresponding to four different actions. On his turn, a player can choose a die and perform the corresponding action: Buy goods at the port, move a client or the consul on the market, make offerings to divinities to recover bonuses (cards), and buy reputation. The value of the die shows the number of times that the action may be made. The goal is to obtain the highest reputation at the end of the day by setting up stalls on the market to sell goods at the best price that the player will have bought in port.<br/><br/>",

Your grades have slipped. With only a few weeks to go you need to raise your grades and fast!  There is only one solution..... if you can&rsquo;t pass&hellip;.CAST!<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>Alchemist Academy is a fast, light-hearted card game for 2 to 6 players and is played in 30 to 60 minutes. Alchemist Academy is a hand management card game relying on 2 decks of cards, a Spell Deck and Shop Deck.<br/><br/>The game includes 23 different spells within the spell deck, which consists of 64 cards in total. Along with 6 different component cards which are required in different variations when casting a spell, this deck consists of 120 cards in total.<br/><br/>Each class (round) players attempts to cast spells on each other and themselves to increase their grade (score). Each of these spells require the correct components in order to cast it. These components are drawn from the Shop Deck.<br/><br/>Some spells are quick and easy to cast and only require 1 or 2 common components to be cast, however these only give the caster a small bonus. Other spells require rare or unique items to be cast and while this might take longer to obtain the right components, the resulting spell is far more powerful.<br/><br/>If the spell is successfully cast, there will be some sort of effect and the player who cast the spell gains points.<br/><br/>",

The white man . . . must build a rail line, establish ranches, and create towns -- while protecting them from destruction by marauding Indian war parties. The Indians must prevent this encroachment by destroying what the white man builds while avoiding elimination by the usually superior Cavalry forces. Hidden movement through the use of dummy counters allows the [Indians] to often escape detection and combat. Event Cards are picked during the game to provide an extra challenge of the unexpected for the players.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Heuchel und Meuchel has a medieval look to the board and tiles, as players try to move characters of different social class up the courtly ladder to their goals. The tiles are of six characters; The Fire-Eater, The Minstrel, The Quack, The Bishop, The Lady &amp; The Prince, each tile having a distinctive background pattern. There are 6 tiles of each, numbered from 1 to 6. The board is a simple grid of columns, having starting and finishing squares with patterns matching the tiles. Players draw 6 tiles each and place them on their starting squares, stacking them if necessary. Then they move a tile, or a stack or an upper part of a stack, up their column to the next free space.<br/><br/>When you place a tile, if there is another player's tile on the same row with the same value, it is taken under protection of yours, by placing it under yours to make a stack. You then have another move. So if the 4 Minstrel ends on the same row as the 4 Lady, she is taken under his wing. This can be done in the finishing area too and if this reveals a tile beyond its station, that is removed as a penalty to its owner. When a tile reaches its matching finishing square, it is turned over and is done with. When only one player can move, the game ends and you score. For each tile that reached its place or beyond, you score its value, deducting any penalties. Most points wins. There is a variant using a die to control your moves.<br/><br/>An odd movement game, with some thought and memory needed for the knock-on effect, but not a great game. Nice to look at though.<br/><br/>",

You must clear your hand of 10 cards, by placing successive cards face down on the deck, bluffing as necessary. So the deck is started by a player laying 1s, the next player lays 2s, one by one and so on. At some point, your bluff is called. If you were false, draw more cards. If you were true, your opponent draws. There are action cards, including a sack of lies which has no value and so you must lie when playing it.<br/><br/>Playing Scheinheilig your goal is to get rid of the cards in your hand.<br/>In total, there are 70 cards numbered evenly from 1 to 10, 26 Angels (Jokers), 8 Devils (don&acute;t want those) and 8 &quot;skip a turn&quot;-cards. Every player starts the game with 10 cards and play proceeds clockwise.<br/>The youngest player starts and has to discard cards with the number &quot;1&quot; face down. At least he has to pretend to discarded 1&acute;s. A player can put down any number of cards. The next player can then either accept whatever was just discarded and discard 2&acute;s on his own or he can question one of the cards just discarded and turn it face up. If he was right and card does not show the correct number, the player who tried to discard a wrong card has to take back the questioned card and all cards on top of it. On top of that he has to roll the die and draw that many cards from the deck. If the questioned card had the correct number, the questioning player has to roll the die and draw that many cards. Angels are always considered the correct number, Devils never. Whenever it is your turn, you can also just draw a card and end your turn. Whoever gets rid of all cards first, wins.<br/><br/>",

By ship to Barcelona? Or by car or train to Milan? No matter how you do it, travel throughout Europe! With a good plan, the correct tickets, and some luck in your luggage, you'll lead a travel party to multiple destinations and use insider tips to make side trips. A slew of information in words and pictures for 155 cities is awaiting your visit!<br/><br/>The players travel by car, train, ship and airplane from city to city and control private and public destinations with three travel companies. The goal is to visit as many destinations as possible in six differently colored regions. Whenever a player reaches a destination, he lays the corresponding city card in front of himself. The game ends when a player has at least ten city cards (or nine cards with five or six players) in six different colors before himself, although the round is played to its end. The winner is the player who visited the most destinations in all six colored regions.<br/><br/>New game mechanisms: Europareise possesses novel game mechanisms that differ from the familiar travel games in the Ravensburger catalog (Deutschlandreise, Weltreise). Movement doesn't come from dice, but rather from tickets for planes, ships, trains, and cars. To keep the lines from tangling on the gameboard, no flight lines or ship lines are marked on the gameboard. The players travel from a ship's harbor with a ship chain to any harbor within reach of the ship chain. Travel by airplane is done similarly.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The game has some similarities to Monopoly but adds a number of twists.<br/><br/>Players buy companies and/or stocks/funds from a range of international banks. The dividend of the funds and stocks is determined through rolls with one or two dice. Players have to pay rent when landing on someone else's company. The rent is a fixed cost depending on if the company has buildings or not. Players can at times during the game be forced to put one of their companies up for auction.<br/><br/>The players move on the board using markers. The players can optionally buy one of two types of cars that will cause the player to move across the board at different speeds. Using &quot;the wreck&quot; the player always has to roll two dice. The more expensive &quot;sports car&quot; gives the player the option of using one OR two dice when rolling for a move.<br/><br/>Every time the players are back at the beginning on the circular board they get and/or pay interest depending on how much money the player have in the bank and if there are any outstanding loans. The current interest rate is determined every now and then using dice rolls.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player with 4 million in cash OR the first player who owns a complete corporation (all companies in a group) and 1.5 million in cash.<br/><br/>",

Lairs, Treasures, and Knights add special twists to the trick-taking.<br/><br/>Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Powerful, majestic, brilliant, conniving, &amp; greedy, they live in a highly structured society centered around age. There are five different draconic races, each of a different color: red, blue, yellow, green, and purple; and one all powerful prismatic Queen, the mother of all races. Each of the draconic races is subdivided into three basic age groups: drakes being the youngest, dragons being middle age, and wyrms being the oldest of all. The older the beast, the more powerful and greedy it becomes. In fact, the oldest of each race, called a Great Wyrm, is so consumed by its greed that its lust for treasure becomes its greatest weakness. Of all dragonkind, they alone are willing to risk all to potentially increase their hoard size. This often leads to their downfall.<br/><br/>The object in this trick-taking card game is to be the player with the most points (indicating draconic power) at the end of six hands (referred to as cycles). You receive points by accurately predicting the number of tricks (referred to as gatherings) you will take and also by taking special card combinations. You want to avoid taking cards with negative points values.<br/><br/>",

However, for a truly winning holiday, you must work out the best moment to return home. This is exactly what you will have to do in &ldquo;Camper Tour&rdquo;. The aim of the game is to complete the longest journey, returning home and consuming all the available Camper points. The game is divided into two distinct phases: the outward journey and the return journey. The length of each player&rsquo;s outward journey depends on the decisions and strategies they adopt during the game. 4 campers start their journey building, along the way, the route: everyone has its expectations to satisfy (represented by the 25 tokens to be played during the game) and typical situations to face (positive or negative unforeseen events). Will you be able to put your energy to good use and complete the longest journey, returning home just at the right time?<br/><br/>",

The remaining tiles are placed openly on the table. Each player now tries to connect his/her tiles into one picture. Players can take turns taking tiles from the table. A player who took a tile is allowed to put one back there as well, but that is not mandatory, so players can opt to increase the number of their tiles.  <br/>When no one can place any more tiles, the scoring starts. All tiles a player couldn't use counts 2 negative points. Each placed tile counts two points; this is doubled if the tiles form a closed ring. Points can also be scored by connecting the thin vines. The player with most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

In any case it&rsquo;s a game with a pinch of &laquo; take that &raquo; and cutthroat maneuvers where you&rsquo;ll get to experience the best UFC games ever. As you may wonder, UFC stands for Ultimate Farming Championship. In 2042, the European Union has long since cut off financial aid to farmers. In order to get out of this situation, farmers created a competition for the installation of electric fences, which very quickly attracted the attention of the public and sponsors.<br/><br/>So now is the time for you to enter the arena and become the best electric fence installer. During your turn, move your tractor along the paths on the board. Place electric fences behind you. As soon as you surround a plot with your fences, take control of it. As soon as you control a certain number of plots (depending on the number of players), you win the game. However, it will not be that simple. You will need to be on the lookout, as your opponents will try to stop you by cutting your electric fences or playing event cards...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The mission of each player is to scout the jungle and collect as many different animals as possible, for as many points. You turn over a face-down card on a grid of cards, and replace it with a card from your hand. The catch is that each row and each column may never have more than one of each animal. Animals have different point values on their cards, and only one card will count positive points - more than one of a type will count negative points at the end. Hyenas, however are always negative.<br/><br/>Originally Published in German as Alles f&uuml;r die Katz:<br/>The title means &quot;Everything for the Cat&quot; and may have an idiomatic meaning of &quot;all for nothing.&quot;<br/><br/>In Alles f&uuml;r die Katz The animals in the zoo are loose and players must attempt to collect one of each type out of a face down grid which represents the zoo, but must avoid collecting any black cats which do not belong in the zoo. Adults should be sure to use the Advanced Rules to ensure an interesting game. Otherwise, the rules are the same as the English version (7 Safari).<br/><br/>",

Before play begins, a scratch round occurs; i.e., a roll of the dice determines which racehorses have been dropped from the race. During the course of the game if any player is unlucky enough to roll the number of a scratched horse they are forced to pay money to the pot. If, however, they roll the number of a remaining horse, that horse advances a spot to the finish.<br/><br/>The game ends when a predetermined number of races have run or a set time has been reached. The player with the most money at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

The player with the lowest score after nine-rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>1 - Each player chooses a Flickin' Chicken. Pay attention to the color, this is YOUR chicken!<br/>2 - Designate someone to be the score keeper. This person will keep score during the game using the included Score-Keeper and pencil. Write each player's name in the Score-Keeper.<br/>3 - The youngest player takes the Target Disc first. They will be the first to throw the disc and their Flickin' Chicken.<br/><br/>PLAYING EACH ROUND<br/>1 - Flickin' Chicken is played in 9 rounds. The person with the lowest score after nine rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>2 - At the start of each round, throw the Target Disc as far as you can. For the first round, the youngest player throws first. For subsequent rounds, the winner of the previous round, play paper-scissor-rock, flip a coin or other tie-breaking ritual to determinate the thrower. Greco-Roman Wrestling is not reccomended.<br/><br/>3 - Taking turns, and starting with the Target Disc thrower, each player throws their Flickin' Chicken at the Target Disc, trying to land any part of their chicken on the disc. If you land any part of your Flickin' Chicken on the Target Disc on your first throw, this is a &quot;Pollo-In-One&quot;. Everyone should congratulate you, as it's quite a feat.<br/><br/>4 - After everyone has thrown, it is now time for your next throw (if needed). The player whose chicken landed furthest from the target disc will go next (throwing from where the chicken landed) continuing with the next furthest player, so forth and so on.<br/><br/>5 - Repeat this until everyone has landed any part of their Flickin' Chicken onto the Target Disc. Once you hit the target disc, remove your chicken from play. Keep track of your throws as each throw is equal to one point.<br/><br/>6 - When every player has landed their chicken on the target the round is over. It is now time to score the round.<br/><br/>7 - Repeat the above until you have played all nine-rounds.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/>1 - The target Disc has 2 sides, a Bonus side and a Penalty side. Each round is different depending on which side of the Target Disc is facing up after it lands!<br/><br/>2 - If any part of your Flickin' Chicken is TOUCHING the center white circle of the Target Disc then score accordingly and as follows:<br/>&quot;Penalty +1&quot; - Add one point to your score if any part of your Flickin' Chicken is touching the Penalty Circle.<br/>&quot;Bonus -1&quot; - Deduce one point from your score if any part of your Flickin' Chicken is touching the Bonus Circle.<br/><br/>3 - After determining if any Bonus or Penalty points apply to a players score, write their score in the Score-Keeper using the including pencil.<br/><br/>4 - After 9 rounds of play, tally up the players' scores. The player with the lowest score wins! (from the Rules-book)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the TV show of the same name that challenges the public to bet big or risk losing everything.<br/><br/>Just like the TV show you begin with a million pounds in your possession, bundled as sets of &pound;50 notes. Over a series of rounds you then run the risk of losing some or the entire amount. The game continues until you complete all the questions, or are left with nothing. How do you win or lose money? Well you must answer questions correctly, with a sequence of multiple choice questions consisting or four, three and then two possible answers. <br/>That&rsquo;s where the fun starts. The board game consists of four trap doors that you can place money on to pick your answers. You can put money on as many doors as you like, but must leave one empty. There&rsquo;s only ever one right answer, so if you spread money across multiple doors you will always lose some of it (or all if the empty door is the correct one).<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to collect as many families of three identical monsters as possible, without being fooled by similar-looking impostors!<br/><br/>When the game starts, each player (using one hand only) must turn over and pick up as many &quot;monster&quot; tiles as possible, one by one. Each tile thus collected is placed face down in the player's other hand. Once a player has placed a tile in their second hand, they cannot look at it again or put it back on the table. Any mistakes will cost you dearly, with penalty points at the end of the game for incomplete and mismatched families.<br/><br/>A limited number of &quot;trophy&quot; tiles are laid out face up alongside the &quot;monster&quot; tiles. Bonus points are awarded for each &quot;trophy&quot; tile at the end of the game. At any time, a player can pick up the highest-value &quot;trophy&quot; tile still available and place it in their other hand. The player must then stop playing. When the last &quot;trophy&quot; tile is taken, all the players who have collected a &quot;trophy&quot; tile and stopped playing start calling out a ten-second countdown.

Two brainstorming teams race to create a list of five things that fit one of two contrasting categories &shy; and then try to guess what the other team has written. Teams can use hints, hand gestures and sound effects to come up with the correct answers. <br/> The game unit is the centerpiece of This Vs That: a sleek electronic game module that not only provides the categories at random, but doubles as the timer and scoreboard for both teams. Game action gets loud and intense as teams scurry to identify their top five answers, and then again as they trade lists and try to identify the top five answers in their opponent&rsquo;s category. Here's the catch... the time it took for one team to come up with their list is exactly how long the other team gets to guess... and vice-versa!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Wizard W&uuml;rfelspiel, players place bids each round as in the Wizard card game, but now they're bidding on how many symbols of a certain color will be rolled on the seven dice. The six-sided dice feature blue, red, yellow, and green symbols on four faces, along with a wizard on a fifth face and a jester on the sixth.<br/><br/>At the start of the round, the seer places a circle on their bid for the round on his score sheet, a bid that specifies a color and a number from 1-5, e.g., blue-4. In turn, each other player places a bid that differs from all other bids placed this round. The seer then decides what color wizards will count as for this round.<br/><br/>The seer then rolls the seven dice up to three times, keeping as many dice as they like after the first and second rolls. If a non-seer's bid is met after the first or second roll, then that player places an X through their bid. If the seer has rolled three times or made their bid, all players stop. If at this point anyone has made their bid, they X the circle; otherwise they write the difference between their bid and the number of that color rolled on the dice in the circle. Instead of writing this difference, a player can cross off the number of jesters showing on the dice in the jester row, assuming the number is from 1-5 and the player has not Xed this space previously.<br/><br/>Whoever bid the highest amount in a different color than the seer becomes the seer for the next round. The game lasts multiple rounds, ending once one or more players has nine Xs in their bidding area. Players then score points, earning 1-5 points for each successful bid and losing points for the differences they recorded. Whoever scores the most points wins!<br/><br/>Wizard W&uuml;rfelspiel includes ten spell cards that you can optionally add to the game. Each spell alters the results of the die rolls or bids in some way.<br/><br/>",

Finally, it will be up to you to steal your friends&rsquo; turns right from under their noses, or sick the Pig cards on them.

It is intended for 2 to 6 players, ages 8 and up.  The game is comprised of 96 playing cards consisting of either a &lsquo;FRONT&rsquo;, &lsquo;MIDDLE&rsquo;, or &lsquo;BACK&rsquo; portion of 32 particular animals.  Each animal is illustrated across the three cards, and includes a fun fact about that animal and a corresponding &lsquo;strength&rsquo; value ranging from 1-10 (e.g. a mosquito is strength-1, and a grizzly bear is strength-10).<br/><br/>Gameplay occurs as players mix and match &lsquo;FRONT&rsquo;, &lsquo;MIDDLE&rsquo;, and &lsquo;BACK&rsquo; cards in their hand to create entirely new creatures, and stage attacks against the creatures in other players&rsquo; hands.  For example, the &lsquo;FRONT&rsquo; of Octopus (4), the &lsquo;MIDDLE&rsquo; of Hippopotamus (7), and the &lsquo;BACK&rsquo; of Armadillo (1) combine to create OC-POTA-DILLO (12)!<br/><br/>",

Hiring Nerds (engineers) creates better products, which attract more users, who in turn generate money. Hiring Suits (Sales) generates more money, which can be used to hire more nerds. At the end of every year the best products steals users from the other products during showdown. Employees initially are very eager to stay with a company, but over time are more likely to move to competing companies, unless they get further (monetary) incentives.<br/><br/>Each player starts with 2-4 products (depending on how many players there are) and four event cards. The game is played over several years. Every year each product gets one turn, i.e. every player gets to play 2-4 times per year. Players adopts users, based on the number of engineers and a die roll. Then they earn revenue, based on the number of users and the number of suits. Third, the player can use money to hire more employees. Soon, no more new hires are available, and players must steal (or &quot;poach&quot;) employees from other players. The other players try to spend their money to prevent &quot;poaching&quot; from happening. During the product show down at year's end users shift towards products that invested wisely. Outside the regular turn order, event cards can be played by any player at any time, both to further their own objectives as well as to hinder other players.<br/><br/>To win, a players needs to obtain the largest number of users. Players need a good mix of nerds and suits, and make smart decisions throughout the game. The constant back and forth over limited resources (employees) is different from many other resource based games and adds a lot of fun. The winning strategy depends to a large extend on guessing/reacting to other player's strategy.<br/><br/>",

They learned that these ancients simultaneously built pyramids towards the sky and had an extensive knowledge of the stars. It was rumored that perhaps they were the original colonizers and space-farers of the first human age.<br/><br/>Now, at the edge of a colossal black hole, a pyramid-craft known as the Zoneplex has emerged with legendary markings and glyphs of the deep past. The known empires have sent their elite warrior-monk mystics on a one-way mission to gain control of the Zoneplex, to emerge victorious and ultimately control the pathways of the universe and time itself.<br/><br/>Zoneplex is a game that combines a tile-laying/exploration mechanism, a collaborative battle system and a zone control system to create an intriguing adventure in an alien pyramid.<br/><br/>The game works in 2 phases with the first phase players not counting Influence points until the pyramid is completed.<br/><br/>In phase 1 players strategically lay tiles determined by action cards to build their pathway through the Zoneplex pyramid whilst being cognizant of the Sacred Symbol card that they are bestowed with before the game begins. While building strategically players also confront creatures within the pyramid which they must collect to become worthy to enter the Eye and win the game. The players control the Zoneplex by gaining Influence points which occurs when a Player places a spirit-stone on the board. Spirit Stones not only sustain one's Influence points but can also be removed to gain bonuses in combat.<br/><br/>In phase 2 after exploring the pyramid, the players reveal their Sacred Symbol cards and count influence points, then a cutthroat race for survival and worthiness begins as players vie to enter &quot;The Eye of The Zoneplex&quot; to become the decisive winner or stand their ground with the most influence points as the action cards run out.<br/><br/>",

Dunnigan turned his eye to the Western Front. Combat Command was described as &quot;Platoon-Company Level Combat, France 1944&quot;.<br/><br/>From the Design Notes:<br/><br/>&quot;PanzerBlitz (published by Avalon Hill) proved to be a very popular game.  It was complex, but most people were enthusiastic about its apparent realism and authenticity.  In point of fact, PanzerBlitz was not all that realistic or authentic.  The game did have its good points.  That it moved at all was a credit to its play-mechanics.  What was lacking was an awareness, and implementation, of some of the more critical aspects of small unit operations.  Chief among these aspects is the &quot;confusion factor&quot;, which becomes nearly decisive at the platoon level.  Other aspects left untreated in PanzerBlitz were the near simultaneity of action and reaction at that scale, as well as a more realistic handling of combined arms coordination.<br/><br/>Not all of these problems (nor others unmentioned) have been solved in Combat Command.  By merely changing the cale and some of the combat and movement mechanics, we have introduced more change in the game than these innovations themselves suggest.  One rather obvious result is that the game is simpler, easier to play.  This is essential for any game.  Too much time spent on the mechanics makes the simulation more of an exercise than a game.  The game-system for platoon level simulation as it now stands in Combat Command is not yet perfect.  But we do feel it's superior to the system we first introduced in Tactical Game 3 and PanzerBlitz.  We are working on still better game-systems for this scale of operations.  When we finish them, we'll publish them!&quot;<br/><br/>The Combat Command game system was quickly discarded as the seventies saw SPI release a string of &quot;new and improved&quot; tactical wargame systems.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Microgame #21 in the Metagaming Microgames series is a wargame module meant to be the character-combat engine for a &quot;Starleader&quot; RPG that was never produced.  It concerns combat in the &quot;30th century of the Space Era (SE)&quot; between defenders and attackers aboard a &quot;Kyrathan 'Royal' class warp yacht&quot; named (conveniently enough) the &quot;Trek Heaven.&quot; It's a hex-and-counter game, but has character sheets; players can allocate resources to create characters as they would in an RPG.<br/><br/>The official rules offer four scenarios, designed to ease the players into increasing complexity and role-playing elements: &quot;The Rescue of Princess Rulian&quot; (one rescuer trying to save the kidnapped princess vs. one terrorist), &quot;Krotic's Treasure&quot; (one rich guy and three thugs vs. four pirates), &quot;Random Piracy&quot; (three crew and one die worth of passengers vs. eight or fewer pirates), and &quot;Random Raids&quot; (all conditions GM- or player-designed).<br/><br/>Approximate playing time is very fuzzy -- obviously the &quot;Rescue&quot; scenario will play much more quickly than a complex user-designed &quot;Random Raid&quot; with lots of role-playing. The maximum number of players isn't necessarily 2, but all of the official scenarios assume only 2 sides or factions. To support more players, teams or special user-designed scenarios would be called for.<br/><br/>",

If the moved piece (or stack of pieces) would land on an occupied space, it covers any pieces located there.<br/><br/>Whenever the first piece of a color is moved over a scoring gate &ndash; of which there are four on the track &ndash; all towers are scored. If a multi-colored tower is on a raised section of the track, the player who owns the top piece earns as many points as the number of pieces in the stack; if such a tower is on the ground, the owner of the bottom piece scores points instead. Each turn before moving, a player can spend a point to move one of his pieces to the top or bottom of a stack.<br/><br/>The game ends once three pieces enter the scoring area at the end of the track &ndash; earning 2-4 points in the proces &ndash; and whoever has collected the most points wins.<br/><br/>Part of the Schmidt Spiele Easy Play line.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Alpha Omega, players assume the roles of the commanders of the Human, Drove and Rhylsh space fleets.  The game features scenarios set chronologically in the fictional distant future setting: from the civil wars of the fledgling Human space empire, to the first alien invasion by the Droves, and the confrontation and eventual alliance between the Humans and the Rhylsh.<br/><br/>The Droves and the Human/Rhylsh factions have different technologies between them, affecting the way their units move and the weapons they have to destroy each other with.  Both sides can deploy fighters, assault ships, destroyers, carriers, battle cruisers, and various other vessels.  Mines can be laid to defend outposts and star bases, but can be swept aside with mine sweepers.  Cargo can be captured, and sensors can be jammed to help cloaked ships infiltrate further.<br/><br/>Each scenario (battle) is resolved as follows.  In the first phase, each player secretly writes down the movement and actions of his units.  The orders of both sides are then simultaneously resolved in the following phases.  After the moves and actions have been resolved, the players repeat the cycle, secretly plotting their orders and openly enacting them.  Combat actions are resolved by rolling dice and consulting the effects from tables.  Play goes on until the scenario's duration has elapsed or a side's Victory Conditions have been met.<br/><br/>",

Once you blow off all 4 limbs (head, left arm, right arm, legs) of the opposing robot, you win the game. A unique stacking mechanic makes building your robot visually appealing and functions as an important part of the gameplay. Attacks and defenses are determined by die rolls. Years of playtesting with multiple teams across the country (Maine, Minnesota, Wisconsin and North Dakota) has developed the game into a highly competitive format that is appealing for hardcore gamers and still very fun for the casual gamer. Rule variations support new players and tournament rules for more hardcore players.<br/><br/>",

The game features music from the original &quot;Tetris&quot; game and will randomly choose pieces that you must play. (That piece symbol will light up, and the next piece - yours if playing solitaire or your opponent's - will blink.) There are five levels of difficulty - the time allowed to drop each piece is less at the higher levels.

There are two types of cards. First, the traditional Top Trumps style cards with minorities and their statistics rated from 1 to 5 stars, such as share of population or affluence. Second, there are Action, Booster and Community Cards which helps the players complete their groups or stopping other players from reaching their goal.<br/><br/>Every player receives two minorities cards and a third card which could be a minority- or an action-card. One round is played in two phases, in the first phase another player is challenged. Both parties select one statistic and a card, the player with the higher total ratings wins the cards and puts them on his victory pile. In the second optional phase action cards can be played. Players then restock their hand to three cards. The game ends when no more challenges are possible. The player with the most minorities wins.<br/><br/>",

Many civilizations were already on the brink of collapse, and had already left their deteriorating home worlds behind in search of resources, peace, and solidarity.<br/><br/>As new civilizations arrived in the TAU CETI system, they settled among the planets, terraforming them into more hospitable worlds. With this mass migration a new alliance was quickly formed, known as the TAU CETI Authority, which encouraged diplomacy among the different cultures and emerged as the new economic power.<br/><br/>Trade began, with each civilization utilizing their strengths and comparative advantages to maximize productivity. Heralded among the civilizations, a sense of friendship, economic prosperity and peace enriched the star system.<br/><br/>But all is not well.

The fragile new alliance&rsquo;s existence is now being threatened! The most skilled Command Ship captains and emissaries from each race are being called upon to assemble a team of specialists, explore the star system for answers, and restore stability before all is lost.<br/><br/>Tau Ceti: Planetary Crisis is a 1-5 player semi-cooperative game centered around an economic engine, asymmetric powers, and strategic manipulation. Tau Ceti tells a story of a newly formed alliance between several alien factions in a time of galactic declension, who compete for influence as they lead their civilization through a crisis-ridden star system.<br/><br/>With multiple paths to victory, you are free to Explore the mysterious outer reaches of the star system for knowledge, Recruit Specialists to help you resolve crises, exploit opportunities through Trade, Buy/Sell commodities as the market fluctuates across planets, Complete Missions for money, Build Orbitals and Defend them against enemies, Acquire Exotic Technologies, and Upgrade your starship's systems for greater advantages as you navigate the cosmic environment.<br/><br/>Tau Ceti has all the elements of a 4X game, but allows you to advance at your own pace with &agrave; la carte advanced rules, and can be played in 1-2 hours.

Finding those specific items will allow escape from the Sanitarium.<br/><br/>The cards form the map of the winding hallways, items scattered all over.  Players must explore the layout (which will differ with each play) to find items that provide them useful powers, and also their Safe Things.  Dark Hallways within the Sanitarium will spawn shadows, which will in turn chase the players.  Getting caught by a shadow might earn you a hallucination.  Hallucinations...are bad.<br/><br/>The enemy of the players is time.  The deck of item and event cards is the timer for the game -- when it runs out, everyone still inside succumbs to their madness!<br/><br/>Sanitarium is fast-paced and easy to learn.  It plays in 30-45 minutes.  Coop, competitive, and solo scenarios are all provided.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes a partner figure and places it on the start space. The 6 partner cards are shuffled and each player takes one - this card shows which partner you want/need in order to get into the 7th heaven. (Partners are not the fellow players at the table - but the chosen partner card of the same color as the wooden piece).<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 12 sympathy cards. These cards are played on your turn and are used to move or exchange a partner figure. There are 3 different types of sympathy cards: the cards with the numbers are used to move the corresponding colord figure on the board; the cards with an arrow moves the corresponding piece forward to the space of another playing piece; finally the cards with the text are played and the actions carried out immediately.  Alternatively, each numbered or arrowed sympathy card can be used to exchange partner cards with another player.<br/><br/>The game starts with a player playing a numbered Sympathy Card and moving the corresponding piece forward that number of spaces, then drawing a new card. The next player then takes his turn, etc. Play continues in this manner - moving or swapping pieces until a player is able to get to the finish (7th Heaven) while holding the correct colored partner card for his playing piece. If no-one makes it to 7th Heaven, the game ends when the last sympathy card is played. The winner in that case is the player with the correct partner card who is closest to 7th Heaven.<br/><br/>",

The standard game is known as the Block game.  Forms of this game are known in many different areas of the world with similar rules.  Puerto Rican Dominoes, Latin Dominoes, and Cuban Dominoes are all forms of the Block game.<br/><br/>Another main variety of Dominoes games are based on the &quot;Fives Family&quot;.  Five-up, All Fives, Sniff, and Muggins are all part of this family.  This variation adds the ends of the dominoes to make a multiple of five for scoring.<br/><br/>Other popular Dominoes games include 42, ChickenFoot, and Mexican Train.<br/><br/>",

During each round, players can meld herds of herbivorous dinos to earn points at the end of the round, play egg cards in hopes of adding to an established herd later in the game. There are several calamity cards that can be drawn, or played by another player, to throw a wrench into a player's plans. Some of these include meat-eating dinosaurs, egg-eating cards and gene pool disasters.<br/><br/>The larger your herds, and the more herds featuring different types of dinos, the more points you can earn at the end of each period. The player with the most points after the Cretaceous period is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Make it to Green River valley with a one of each type of horse (eight types)<br/><br/>Game 3: Same as game 2, but the goal is to arrive at Green River Valley with three pairs of horses that each have attributes in common (same color, etc.)<br/><br/>All three are simple games and follow the basic: &quot;Roll dice, move piece, read card&quot; type, with a little variation. The map has some interesting choices - different routes converge at some areas forcing players to choose which way to go, since landing on another player's token allows you to &quot;steal&quot; a horse.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best part of the game is the artwork and background. The horse cards are beautifully drawn and the descriptions on the back of each include detail on the color, markings, and some interesting horse facts. Best for the kids of horse enthusiasts, or kids who are horse enthusiasts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The humorous card game Big Badaboom features a lot of explosive action, high player interaction, a non-sequential order of play, some nifty new mechanisms and some proven old ones, numerous chances to stick it to your opponents in nasty ways, and stunning graphics.<br/><br/>The players of Big Badaboom take on the roles of wretched goblins in penal servitude to the cruel High Necromancer. Their task is to sit in an explosive-proof dungeon and through reverse-engineering examine various explosive contraptions manufactured by the necromancer's enemies. But the task to gain hands-on knowledge about what makes the devices go off and what damage they can do is no picnic, and not even a lifetime of resurrections can change that. The goblins want out and the only way to do that is to survive long enough to earn the gold coins needed to bribe their way out of their miserable situation.<br/><br/>To win players need to keep their heads, perfect their timing, make every card count and, above all, make sure not to be the one holding the bomb when it explodes.<br/><br/>Compared to the original game, Big Badaboom has five more bombs, five more mechanisms, and a new category of cards: the resurrection cards. These optional cards add even more slapstick humor to the game. The resurrection cards are placed in a separate pile, and whenever a goblin is caught in an explosion and resurrected, the player draws one card. On it the player will find an annoying, but hilarious, side effect that the goblin has gained for the next round as a result of the explosion. Finally, Big Badaboom comes in a stunning &quot;anarchist bomb&quot;-style case.<br/><br/>Reimplements<br/><br/><br/>    Badaboom<br/><br/><br/>",
