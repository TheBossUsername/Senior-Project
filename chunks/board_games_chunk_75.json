        "description": "Dream Shift is a solo print-and-play card game.  It is designed to be quick and fun.<br/><br/>In Dream Shift, the player must battle his or her nightmares in a constantly shifting dream world.  Each dream setting or nightmare is a manifestation of the dreamer's subconscious attempting to communicate with the conscious mind in order to resolve various issues.  Maybe the dreamer needs to learn something about him- or herself.  Perhaps he or she has some fear or guilt that must be overcome.  The Dream deck contains both Setting and Nightmare cards.  The player begins with one Setting and one Nightmare, and must resolve issues presented by these cards in order to draw a new Dream card to replace either the Setting or the Nightmare.<br/><br/>To do this, the player has access to Power cards.  These allow the player to resolve issues on the Setting and Nightmare cards, which will shift either the Setting or the Nightmare and present new issues to resolve.  The player must make careful use of his or her Power cards to strategically draw additional Power cards or to shift the dream.  The game ends when the Dream deck is empty, or when the player is &quot;stuck&quot; with no Power cards to resolve the issues presented.<br/><br/>",

Great fame and glory will be bestowed on those who manage to defeat one of the many dragons that prowl the land, but they will not be able to do so without the aid of a knight. Those seeking a gentler path may make a deal with the merchant, court the princess or gain a small favour from the jester. And the belligerent will seek to harm their opponents by banding with the black knight or by persuading a thief to perform his nefarious deeds. Can you become chief noble by the end of your time in Pellinoria?<br/><br/>The game is played over 4 years of 4 seasons each. Before each year, the cards are laid out so that each corresponds to a number. Then, during each season, the players roll their dice, assign pairs of them to cards that match the value rolled and take the relevant actions. At the end of the game, the player with most victory points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Designer John Theissen has another compact operational sandbox for ACW gamers to play around in. While the game has some similarities to his MORE AGGRESSIVE ATTITUDES, important differences in scale and emphasis result in a unique experience that's specific to the factors that doomed the Union's 1864 Red River Campaign.<br/><br/>Each side has three Leaders whose presence is generally required to launch an attack, but there the similarities end. The Union army is larger but also more cumbersome, being dependent on slow-moving and vulnerable supply trains. A rigid leadership structure makes coordination difficult, and one of those leaders is going to sit on his hands in Alexandria for the first third of the game instead of advancing toward the Union objective: Shreveport.<br/><br/>The Confederates have less strength points to throw around, but they have a much more flexible command structure, and don't have to worry about their own supply. Slowing the Union advance (not that they need much help) and launching well-chosen attacks, supported by well-timed Special Events cards, is key for the beleaguered butternuts.<br/><br/>Within these parameters, there's ample room for players to experiment, with multiple ways to approach your objectives (and to frustrate your opponent's). There's only a handful of units on each side, but plenty of hexes to maneuver in. It's a challenging game, while remaining short enough to play in a single evening, and simple enough to serve as an excellent introduction to operational scale gaming.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mystery Detective is a mystery solving party game that you can start playing almost as soon as you open the box.<br/><br/>One player, the Chief, takes one of the 100 illustrated cards and reads it to himself. The front of the card has the mystery, the back the solution. Then he reads the front of the card to the players and shows them the illustration. The other players are the detectives. Singly and together, they try to solve the mystery by asking the Chief questions. But he can only answer Yes, No, Close, or Not Relevant.<br/><br/>Here is the first mystery:<br/>A woman dies because she was on the phone too long.<br/><br/>We often talk too long on the phone but don't die! What's going on?<br/><br/>The detectives discuss and try to form theories that can be proved or disproved by their questions:<br/>A lovers' quarrel?<br/>Was the woman killed by her husband? - no<br/>By her lover?- no<br/><br/>Okay, maybe international espionage:<br/>Was the woman a spy? - no, not relevant<br/><br/>Hmm. Maybe we can localize this.<br/>Was the woman lying down?- no<br/>Standing up? - no<br/>Sitting?  - YES!!<br/><br/>Now we're getting somewhere&hellip;<br/><br/>Bit by bit the detectives try to piece together the mystery. Often a question from one detective will give another an idea for a whole new line of questioning. There is no winner or loser but when you finally solve the mystery, you feel brilliant!<br/><br/>The mysteries, while not all crimes, are morbid and twisted and often very funny. You need to discuss, question and think outside of the box in order to solve them. Great fun, you can play almost anywhere, anytime. In the car, at the dinner table or at a gathering, all are perfect for this co-cop mystery solving game.<br/><br/>This volume contains 100 cases. <br/>For Black Stories fans, this first volume includes new translations of Black Stories 1 and 2.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When you want to instruct one of your Characters to interact with another entity (with another ID), you must play the correct Action card and read the matching paragraph, numbered with the combination of the 2 IDs. example: The player wants Simon to scavenge a metal cabinet, so they assign him a Rummage card. This action lets Simon (904) interact with the cabinet (124):  the player must read the Paragraph 124-904 in the Storybook to discover the result of the interaction.

The frogs can hop hon themand eat the insects. Each player controls a frog with a rolling tongue, which can easily catch the insects.<br/><br/>During his turn, each frog has two actions (also identical) to choose from the 4 avalilable: jumping on an adjacent free water lily, bouncing on another frog to reach a free water lily, replace a free water lily, or roll the tongue to catch insects /  kiss the Princess. But you can kiss the Princess only if you have collected a sufficient number of insects.<br/><br/>Each frog has its own asymmetric power and, every Princess needs a different collection of insects to be kissed and change the rules in a different way. Adapt your strategy to the actual Princess and to your power, and slow down the leader. May the prince with the longest tongue win!<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Ne 'Il Principe Ranocchio', ogni giocatore impersona un principe trasformato in un Ranocchio dal malvagio stregone di corte (che vuole sposare la Principessa impunemente). L'Obiettivo di ogni giocatore &egrave; tornare umano, ma per farlo deve accumulare potere mangiando insetti per poi ... baciare la Principessa!<br/><br/>Lo stagno &egrave; rappresentato da un tappetino playmat, su cui vengono piazzate le ninfee su cui i ranocchi possono saltellare e gli insetti che devono catturare. Ogni giocatore controlla un ranocchio con la lingua srotolabile, con cui pu&ograve; agevolmente acchiappare gli insetti.<br/><br/>Durante il proprio turno, ogni ranocchio ha due azioni (anche uguali) a scelta fra le 4 disponibili: saltare su una ninfea libera adiacente, rimbalzare su un'altro ranocchio per arrivare su una ninfea libere, ricollocare una ninfea libera, oppure srotolare la lingue per acchiappare degli insetti o ... baciare la principessa. E' possibile baciare la Principessa soltanto se si sono raccolti un numero adeguato di insetti.<br/><br/>Ogni Ranocchio ha il proprio potere ed ogni Principessa richiede una diversa collezione di insetti per essere baciata e modifica le regole in un modo diverso. Adeguate la vostra strategia alla Principessa in gioco e al vostro potere, e rallentate chi &egrave; in vantaggio. E che vinca il principe pi&ugrave; linguacciuto!<br/><br/>",

To insure the security of the Macedonian Hegemony, and to wrest control of the Persian Empire&rsquo;s territories bordering on the Aegean and Mediterranean, Alexander launched an invasion of Anatolia. The first major battle was fought against the Persian satraps of Anatolia at the Granicus river. Alexander&rsquo;s forces garnered a decisive victory, and in response Darius traveled west to personally organize his troops for a showdown with the Macedonian interloper. The two sides met along the Pinarus river that flows into the Gulf of Issus. The fates of two empires were about to collide.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In the advanced rules, there is a following suit rule and the two cards play a much heavier effect on play, identifying one team as good and one as evil, thus associating that team with the two 'evil' suits and vice versa.<br/><br/>The players take tricks, winning them by playing a higher card of the led suit or by playing the highest trump (i.e. a major arcana). At the end of the game the cards taken by winning the tricks are added up (face cards, aces and some major arcana are worth more points).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Epic Picnic is a fast and crazy card game inspired by a verbal memory game from childhood, corrupted with humor from adult life (ages 17+!). You might bring figgy pudding on a picnic, fashion a makeshift weapon out of Peter Piper's pickled pecker, or inherit a Nicaraguan death squad from your grandfather.<br/><br/>Best of all, it's super easy to pick up and play!<br/><br/>Players reveal cards from a common deck to represent the ridiculous and terrible things they are bringing on the picnic (or one of 9 other scenarios) while at the same time trying to stay focused and remember what everyone else is bringing in order. Miss just one card and you're out of the game in this last-man-standing, brain-hemorrhaging face-off!<br/><br/>The rules also contain several variations and plus an alternate method of play -- Picnic Frenzy -- where players recite just one card per turn, making for much faster gameplay. Played in rounds and featuring 5 second turns, it is perhaps even more challenging than the original!<br/><br/>",

Sufyan, his cousin and the formidable governor of Syria to construct a fleet and carry on the war against Byzantium. From the highlands of Armenia to the shores of Crete, the elite Syrian army and navy seeks to overwhelm the last stronghold of the Byzantine Empire, Constantinople.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for them, the new emperor, a callous youth named Constans, is equally determined to stop them. Coming to the throne in the wake of murder and revolt, the young sovereign commands only the battered remnants of the army, but it is now fighting on its home ground.<br/><br/>Apocalypse in the East  by designer Jason Juneau, features yearly turns, regimental sized units, special rules on the Empress Fausta, and random events including the Monothelete Controversy, earthquakes, nepotism by Caliph Uthm&atilde;n, purges in the Byzantine high command and the introduction of Greek Fire. Can you take the helm of the Syrian army and navy and storm the greatest citadel on earth, or will you instead prevent it and maintain Byzantium&rsquo;s role as Christendom&rsquo;s eastern march?<br/><br/>",

In this game you will have the opportunity not only to find out about a number of interesting places in Latvia, but also to travel in your own way. You can use boats, trains, and even airplanes to travel, if you have enough tickets for it; if you don't, you'll have to stick to your feet. But watch out for other travelers. They are likely to put obstacles in place to be the first to travel Latvia!<br/>&mdash;description from publisher (translated)<br/><br/>The game area is a map of Latvia, its territory is divided into 4 historical counties with a total of 60 viewing objects connected to different roads - pedestrians, railways, rivers and air. Each viewing object have its own information card with a description of it and a small bonus that the player receives after visiting it. To win, you have to visit 4 objects, one by one in each county, and complete the end-of-game task that the players roll out at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>On his own move, a player can move on the card for up to 3 steps. Pedestrian roads are free, others need tickets. They can be obtained by stopping on a blank, unnumbered field. In the same way, you can get opportunity cards that can be played before you go, helping yourself or interfering with other players.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Fuel consumption is basically one unit every time the die is rolled, and running out of fuel can force a landing at an emergency air field or cause a pilot to bail out.<br/><br/>The game is interesting because of the scale plastic planes used as playing pieces (actual reproductions of the F-105) and in the cardboard 'control panels' which players use to keep track of altitude and fuel. The rules also include a two-page insert describing &quot;the world's most powerful one-man airplane&quot; in detail.<br/><br/>",

Has a somewhat unique speed-based initiative system where units locked in battle engage in a hierarchical fashion (spells first, missile weapons next, etc).  Units move in formation with a leader counter commanding.  The leader counters act like initiative chits.  Combat resolution is fairly normal, a modified CRT system with major column shifts.

Each round consists of an Auction Phase (one auction) and an Action Phase (executing one or several actions on the board). After every Third Round, a Scoring Round occurs. Power Cards are awarded, according to the distribution of Agents in each Site. Some of these Power Cards award a single Victory Point, which is needed to win the game. After 3 Rounds, the cycle begins again. The game ends immediately, if a player acquires the required number of Victory Point Cards or if, after a Scoring Round, there aren't enough new Power Cards to place 3 Power Cards for each Site. The game is a compelling race against the clock, as the players struggle to choose the right Auction Cards, effectively distribute their Agents on the game board, and win Power Cards that allow them to execute special actions early in the game (often, confounding teams of rival Agents), and award Victory Points later in the game.<br/><br/>",

You start by drawing the top card of either the draw or discard piles, and end your turn by discarding a card --or by playing nothing and saying &quot;Pass&quot; (to build up your hand).<br/><br/>You may play tricks of three cards of any event suit to roll the two dice for your piece in that event. Free cards are used to round out incomplete tricks.<br/><br/>If you have a trick on the table from a previous turn, you may add the appropriate Good Start card to it --this gives you an extra roll of the dice. You may also play Bad Start cards on other players' tricks, to prevent them from playing Good Starts (but not from adding tricks).<br/><br/>A player who goes out (played all his cards, with or without discarding) gets a free dice roll in the event of his choice.  The deal then passes left, and both the draw and discard piles are picked up and shuffled anew (as at game start).<br/><br/>No two pieces may occupy the same spot; if you cannot pass, you stop behind.  As pieces pass the finish lines, medals are awarded as appropriate for that event.<br/><br/>Three players: the fourth team isn't used.  Two players: Each player runs two teams; each trick is good for two separate rolls in that event, one per team.<br/><br/>Scoring: Gold is worth 8 points, silver 4 and bronze 2.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fire Fight, Modern Miniature skirmish rules<br/><br/>These are a comprehensive set of rules for small unit actions since 1945. They are designed to give a playable game whilst recreating the uncertainty of modern warfare, to this end the &lsquo;old fashioned&rsquo; method of drawing chits is used to control initiative whilst for playability the hit chance of some weapons has been reduced, however it still does not pay to advance in the open towards an alert sustain fire machine gun.<br/>With these rules any action from the desperate battles of the Israeli War of Independence as described in 0 Jerusalem, to the siege of Hamburg from the Zone series can be fought, not just those in Vietnam on which many other rules concentrate.<br/>I would like to thank the staff of Heroic Miniatures and Wallasey Immortals Wargame Club for their help in testing the rules.<br/><br/>A game turn is thirty seconds long, composed of a variable number of phases between five and ten seconds depending on the initiative of the troops. The ground scale is one centimeter equals one meter which is near enough one to one for 20mm or 1/76th figures. If you wish to use 1/200th a ground scale of five millimeters to one meter is more appropriate.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Realistic game of modern naval warfare, without getting the player bogged down into too any technical details.<br/><br/>It is appreciated that modern naval vessels are equipped with highly sophisticated electronics and weapons systems, but their prime object is still to destroy enemy shipping or incoming missiles. It is therefore assumed that Ship&rsquo;s Captains and Gunnery Officers will be aware of the best means to fight off incoming attacks and will use all available missiles and gunnery to its best advantage, as they close to tactical battle range.<br/><br/>A percentage system has been adopted and therefore a lair of percentage dice will be needed to play the game. The dice -one red (10&rsquo;s) and one white or black (units) are always thrown in pairs (e.g. an 8 on the red dice and a 2 on the white or black dice represents a throw of 82%). All figures in the tables are basic percentage chance of hits or detection, after this has been amended by the tactical factors which may apply, the final score is arrived at. A throw of this percentage or less is sufficient. A short measuring tape is provided for use when moving ships but an expanding metal tape will be of use for measuring the ranges of long range weapons.<br/>GROUND SCALE: 2 cm = 1 Nautical Mile<br/>TIME SCALE : 1 move = 5 minutes<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Miniature rules<br/>Although our title gives precedence to armored warfare, this set of rules is equally suitable for combat between infantry companies, and is the first to make realistic provision for all the fringe areas such as communication, engineering, air attack, obstacle clearance, fighting in fortifications, off-table fire, air observation, target location, weather, all types of terrain, and the reaction of troops to combat stress.<br/><br/>The rules are designed to be equally suitable for the old favorite 1/72 scale models and figures and the newer scales down to 1/300 which are revolutionizing modern period war gaming.<br/><br/>The period covered by this set has been selected to include the rise of the fast tank and the independent armored formation, the Spanish, Abyssinian, Sino-Japanese, Russo-Japanese and Russo-Finnish Wars, all the campaigns of the second world war from the invasion of Poland to the Russian sweep through Japanese Manchuria, and the Korean War.<br/>A companion set covers the period from 1950 to 1975, which sees the introduction of anti-tank guided missiles, helicopters, range finders, and efficient A.P.D.S., H.E.S.H. and H.E.A.T. ammunition for tank guns.<br/>A third set covers the whole period from 1925 to 1975, but from the point of view of infantry platoon level combat, and is suitable for figures from 1/72 to 1/35 scale.<br/><br/>This particular period is a very complicated one, with old weapons being replaced by new in an ever proliferating series.<br/>As usual, we include quick reference sheets to avoid leafing through the complete text in a frantic attempt to find the bit you want.<br/>As it is impossible to include details of all weapons on a single sheet, it has instead those that are reasonably universal, together with blank spaces into which you can copy from the main text those others you want to use.<br/>After all, not many wargamers habitually use both Centurions and 1920 vintage Vickers Mediums at the same time, but please don&rsquo;t take this as a challenge!<br/><br/>We presume throughout that a player will have a general knowledge of the weapons he elects to use, and so include performance details only.<br/><br/>One change from our previous sets of rules is the use of alternate instead of simultaneous movement. This is partly due to the reduced validity of a strict time scale in tank versus tank engagements where an exchange of fire is normally completed and one tank disabled in 10 to 15 seconds at close range. It also speeds up play, giving a truer flavor of fast moving tank action, and enables you to tell at a glance which party in an exchange shoots first.<br/><br/>Other innovations include a one to one figure scale and an arithmetical instead of a logarithmic ground scale. A model or figure therefore always represents a single tank or man, not a platoon or section, and a millimeter measured on the table always represents one meter.<br/>Metric measures are used because all campaigns were fought with metric maps, even the one inch ordnance survey has a 1,000 metro grid.<br/><br/>Finally, this is the first set of rules we have produced where we can claim relevant personal experience, one of us having served in the Desert and in Western Europe during the Second World War, and the other having been in turn a field engineer, a tank gunner with experience of Churchill and Sherman and later tanks, and an infantryman.<br/><br/>Includes the rule book and a Quick Reference Sheet<br/><br/>",

Rules, charts, a map, two dice, and twenty miniatures.<br/><br/><br/>from a merged game<br/>The object of Witch's Caldron is for the Witch and her Servants to defend the treasures of her cave from the Wizard and his Adventurers. The Wizard has 20 turns to invade the Witch's cave and escape through the three Magic Gates (not from the cave) with as many treasures as possible. If within 20 turns, all of the treasures have been removed from two of the three Magic Gates, but the Witch's magic sword has not been captured and removed from the cave (immediate win for Wizard), the winner is determined by awarding the Wizard points for treasures removed from the cave and awarding the Witch points for Wizard's Adventurers killed. Combat results are determined by &quot;casting spells&quot; and rolling dice.<br/>The playing board is 16 squares by 19 squares. The game includes 20 metal figurines, including the Witch and her eight Servants and the Wizard and his 10 Adventurers.<br/><br/>",

If the rack moves past the Try Line at either end of the field a Try (Touch down)  is scored.  Players hold cards in their hands which they use to influence play in the rack.  The Cards represent players on the field and special actions that they may do.  The idea of the rack is that your opponent can see where you cards are, just not exactly which players they are.  This means the game has a memory component to it.  The game tries to focus on Rugby's ideas and leaves out many of the finer points in an effort to keep the game simple. The Game is currently free to download from the web as 4 small pdf files which include cut out plans to build the card rack.<br/><br/>",

When shares are bought or sold the price goes up or down one unit for every block of shares traded - with the value of the shares being tracked on the board.  As the share price swings players attempt to buy low and sell high in order to generate the most profit.<br/><br/>The Advanced Game:<br/>In the advanced game players are also allowed to take out loans and put options.  Various random events, such as market trends are also introduced through the use of the Market Die.<br/><br/>For both versions of the game the values of the various trades are recorded on the score pads.  In the basic game the winner is the first to accumulate 1 Million starting from a 100K stake. In the advanced game the target is 2 Million, but free of loans and put options.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Being an Account of the Art of War During the Time of His Grace The Duke of Marlborough&quot;<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>Fusil and Fortress is a Systems Analysis Classic Series game which offers the player an incredible amount of detail while providing a game which is easy to learn, interesting to read, and challenging to play. Fusil and Fortress is designed as a two-part game. Sections one through nine contain the rules required to play the tactical game, with Section three devoted to history, tactics, and organization. Sections ten through fourteen contain the rules for siege warfare, supply, engineering, and administration. Fusil and Fortress is not designed as a multi-level game in which you must learn more and more complicated rules. Once you have read the game, you can play it. We do this for two reasons. Our games are clearly written and our design staff feels that the wargamer has a lot more common sense than many games give him credit for. As an added bonus, Fusil and Fortress is designed to be played with or without an umpire.<br/><br/>We feel that Fusil and Fortress will be one of the most engaging games you have ever played. The reason for this is that all our designers are wargamers and understand problems with rules.<br/><br/>Designer's Notes<br/><br/>Because Fusil and Fortress is the first commercial wargame to effectively address warfare in the early 18th Century, the design staff felt that it was appropriate to discuss certain elements of game construction because of the radical departure from traditional game mechanics.<br/><br/>In most games, actual formations are sacrificed in order to cram the appropriate number of figures in the proper space. Thus, a one-deep line of figures may represent a two- or three-deep line of actual soldiers. While this method of game design may be perfectly acceptable for other eras, it would not be for the early 18th Century. Linear Infantry formations and numbers of ranks were of paramount importance and it would be impossible to use one rank of figures to represent more than one rank. Therefore, we have sacrificed a little space for accuracy and detail unknown in any other game. The upshot is that a unit will operate in the correct linear space in the proper number of ranks, but it will occupy an area slightly deeper than it actually would have. The rules have been formulated to mitigate this depth.<br/><br/>This unique design enables Fusil and Fortress to demonstrate the differences in the Dutch, Swedish, and French methods of musketry in a way you can actually see so that you can make them work the way they actually did.<br/><br/>The rules for artillery have also been designed to accurately represent the &quot;fall of shot&quot; and the occasional ricochet. The windage gauge is normally placed near the target which results in a smaller angular deviation of shot as the range increases. The inaccuracy of this method is obvious, and we have corrected it. Because of the design of the artillery firing system in Fusil and Fortress, no artificial additions for enfilade fire or other tactical advantages are needed.<br/><br/>The siege rules are a wargaming first and we do not believe that anything like them can be found anywhere. We have done everything possible to create in miniature the Vauban method of siegecraft and fortification. In conjunction with these unique combat and siege rules, we have also provided every last detail for engineering, supply, and administration, so that you can even &quot;pay&quot; your troops if you want to. You do not have to use all the information in Fusil and Fortress to have an exciting early 18th Century wargame, but when you do want information, it is there.<br/><br/>We feel that keeping these design differences in mind will help you understand the game better and enjoy it more. Good gaming.<br/><br/>",

So the fort has the size of a large 4 x 4 square enclosing 4 squares like a court.<br/>From the two sides of the boards opposing the fort two players start from given starting points with four &ldquo;tourists&rdquo; to reach the fort. <br/>The &ldquo;tourists move in a kind of three-dimensional &ldquo;knight-move&rdquo;, so, after two steps on the same level it can jump one step vertically, or even after one step on the same level two steps vertically. This means that on the flat &ldquo;desert&rdquo; they have to cross first on their way to the fort, the figures are quite lame. For this there are four &ldquo;helping stones&rdquo;, which can be used as a stair. But you can not just put them wherever you want, but on the imaginary cross-points constituted by two movable strategic bars on the side of the board. Each of these bars contains three marks, so there are nine cross points where you can build &ldquo;helping stones&rdquo;.<br/>In each turn a player can move one of his &ldquo;tourists&rdquo;, one &ldquo;helping stone&rdquo; or one bar to constitute new points.<br/>The player who first enters the fort with three of his figures, one of them on a tower, is winning the game.<br/><br/>",

You throw one heck of a party and you invite all who want to come and join in. And when they leave, you give them a thank-you present.<br/><br/>On the 10th of September 2005, the Deutsche Spielemuseum (the German Game Museum and brainchild of Peter Lemcke) celebrated in style in its current hometown of Chemnitz, in the German state of Saxony, by attempting to break a world record in conjunction with that other birthday kid, the &quot;Settlers of Catan&quot;. A more than 300 meter long game table was erected, offering room for 1000 Settler players, who all could participate on one gigantic Settlers map, using 17,500 Settlers' hexagons in the process. As it happened, 816 participants sat down to invade the ribbon island and the record stood.<br/><br/>To mark the occasion, a commemorative Settler expansion, themed on the German state of Saxony, was issued by Kosmos, in a limited edition of 1000, one for each participant. Klaus Teuber was on hand to sign his life away.<br/><br/>Saggsen Gadan presented two new scenarios for Settlers, both requiring game pieces from the basic set to play. Special game pieces needed for these Saxony scenarios were also included, ready to cut out. Instead of the usual variable game-set-up of the basic game, the two scenarios both use a ready-made map. There is one scenario map printed on each side of the expansion sheet, in the same vein as the game boards from boxed historical theme set expansions.<br/><br/>1. Saggsen-Gadan:<br/>For this game variant, players must colonize Saggsen using the usual building and resource trading mechanisms. Through progressive development, different manufacturers can be founded, whose products subsequently can be turned into victory points. But be warned: Saggsen is sliced up by many rivers, that can only be crossed at bridges. To become King of Saggsen you will have to make your influence count in the seven regions of the state. Who is the first to obtain 10 victory points?<br/><br/>2. Catan-Offensive in Chemnitz - a quick scenario for 2-3 players:<br/>By utilizing the resources obtained through building and trading, players aim to populate the city of Chemnitz bit by bit. As the game progresses, players can obtain colorful postcards of historical buildings, museums and leisure facilities. These postcards can then be exchanged for victory points. Karl Marx, after whom the city was known in its East German days when it was called Karl-Marx-Stadt, now takes over the role of Joker/Robber.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    CATAN<br/><br/><br/>",

To do this, you are employing the best animators (as well as the cheapest) you can find.  These animators churn out image after image, but with one problem.  They don't have a script!  Luckily the inventors working (slaving) for you have developed the first and only Anime Plotting Device(TM).<br/><br/>As the characters of your various anime are added to your highly advanced, computerized environment, they appear in a fully constructed three-dimensional holographic matrix, awaiting your every whim!  Unfortunately, this same system was also sold to your competitors (Your poor scientists were immediately executed, of course), and you are now forced (by contract, naturally) to share the warehouse-sized holographic matrix with your sworn enemies...<br/><br/>Being the sleazy MegaCorp president that you are, you decide to sabotage your competitor by slipping strange plots into their episodes, as well as trying to advertise your own shows by adding your characters in to kick some anime butt.  Your competitors waste no time in retaliating.  Soon, a malfunction in the Anime Plotting Device(TM) leads to a startling discovery:  the anime has become tangible, physical.  The anime is real!<br/><br/>Desperately, both you and your competitors hire insanely overpriced engineers to fix the problem.  The characters themselves, luckily, do not realize that they are real, and continue to do your bidding.  They still appear in the matrix as normal - through the scanning of the animators drawings.  They just do real property damage now.  Your competitors, never to be out done, do the same.  In a fit of desperation, you find yourself forced to bring occasional live humans into the unstable matrix to help, fight, and eventually to die.  They die only because, once something has entered the matrix, it's in there until it's dead.  Your best director found this out a little late for your liking.  After tangling with a 20mm anti-tank cannon wielding BU-11 Model Combat Boomer with a troubled past, he became but a memory.<br/><br/>...<br/><br/>Object of the game...<br/>Anime Madness(TM) is a game for two or more players, with plenty of room for house variants.  The object of Anime Madness(TM) is to become the reigning MegaCorp by doing one of two things.  You may either drive your opponent from 20 Ratings Points down to 0, becoming the only thing on television, or you may raise your Ratings Points up to 40, becoming the coolest thing on television.<br/><br/>",

They are specifically designed for jet versus jet combat and unlike other products that go into too much detail, each player can handle several aircraft. The rules operate in three dimensions while only physically using two, height being indicated beside an aircraft.<br/><br/>There are guns, air to air rockets, Infra Red and Radar guided air to air missiles, SAM sites, etc. Data for over 200 aircraft in use by many nations from the 1950&rsquo;s onward are included.<br/><br/>The skill of aircrew is very important and the system provides for this. The players can decide how good the crew are by deciding the level of training they think is appropriate, though a random system for skill generation is also provided.<br/><br/>Radar and electronics are handled within the rules by means of a Tech Level system that allows for systems to be improved or obsolete within the game, but without extra complication. Ground attacks are possible as part of the game mission mix, though the effect of the attack will depend on using the right weapon. SAM and AAA sites are also included.<br/><br/>Note<br/><br/>The game rules were developed specifically with jet fighters in mind and the data calculation reflects this. We took a decision NOT to include propeller driven aircraft (with a very few specific exceptions), and this has provoked comment from some users, especially if fighting the Korean war.<br/><br/>Summary of Contents<br/><br/>INTRODUCTION: Scales; Definitions and concepts; Technology Levels; Designers&rsquo; Notes<br/><br/>MEN AND MACHINES: Aircrew Training and  Skills; Skill Rolls; Dazed, Wounded or Dead Aircrew; Crew Survival; Aircrew Experience; Aircraft Capability; Equipping Stores; Miscellaneous Stores; Jettisoning Stores; Destruction of Aircraft<br/><br/>SETTING UP A GAME, DEPLOYMENT: Points Values; Organizing a Game; Starting the Game; Deploying Surface Targets; Deploying aircraft; Off Table Reserves; Air Superiority Missions; Ground Attack Missions; Intrusion Missions; Interception Missions; Rearming and Repairs; Victory and Defeat<br/><br/>SEQUENCE OF PLAY: Ending the Game; Summary of Crew Activities and Skill Rolls<br/><br/>FLIGHT FUNDAMENTALS: Formations and Movement; The Effect of Altitude on Performance; Speed and Fuel Use; Order of Movement Actions; Movement; Turning; Effects of Damage on Turning; Climbing; Zoom Climb; Climbing Half Loop; Diving; Diving Half Loop; Displacing Models and mid air collisions<br/><br/>GAME ARCS<br/><br/>RADAR AND DETECTION: Contact Markers; Detection&mdash;Visual; Detection&mdash;Search Radar; Detection of Objects on the Ground; Losing Contact<br/><br/>SHOOTING GUNS AND AIR TO AIR ROCKETS: Guns; Arcs of Fire; Lines of Fire; Target Priority and Timing; Aircrew Shooting; Shooting Procedure; Modifiers; Hitting the Target; Multi-barrel weapons; Automatic Hit Bonus; Ammunition Supply; Damaging the Target; Critical Hits; Effect of Formations on Shooting; Air to Air salvo rockets; AIR-2 Genie air to air nuclear missile<br/><br/>SHOOTING AIR TO AIR MISSILES: Air to Air Missiles; Obtaining a Lock; Losing a Lock; ECM Aircraft; Breaking a Lock; Firing Missiles; Damaging the Target<br/><br/>ATTACKING A SURFACE TARGET: Spotting the Target; Identifying the Target; Attack and Ammunition Types; Attacking an Identified Target; Defensive Fire; Attacking an Unidentified Target; Ground defenses; Unlisted Air to Ground Weapons<br/><br/>GROUND DEFENSES: AAA Guns; Air defense Zones; SAM Batteries<br/><br/>AIRCRAFT DATA: Understanding the Aircraft Data Tables; Filling in the Aircraft Record Sheets; Data for Civilian and Transport Aircraft; Data for Combat Aircraft; Aircraft in Action<br/><br/>TABLES: Payload types and location; Miscellaneous Equipment; Surface to Air Missiles; Air to Air Missiles; Air to Surface Weapons<br/><br/>1 AND 2 SEATER RECORD SHEET; LARGE AIRCRAFT RECORD SHEET<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During Robert E. Lee's first invasion of the North, Lee learned of a threatening Federal advance East of Hagerstown, Maryland. Because Stonewall Jackson was besieging Harper' Ferry, he instructed Daniel Harvey Hill to hold the South Mountain passes in the rugged Blue Ridge, just East of Boonsboro. It was essential to delay McClellan&rsquo;s progress so Jackson would have time to take Harper's Ferry and reunite his scattered divisions before the Army of the Potomac caught him unprepared.<br/><br/>Despite strong defensive features the numerically superior Federal forces should have overwhelmed the rebels but the inaction of Pleasonton and Burnside squandered their advantage. In the end Lee's defense of the South Mountain passes cost him 2800 casualties as opposed to the Federal losses of 2300 and led directly to the fearful slaughter at Antietam.<br/><br/>Fire on the Mountain concentrates on the action around Turner's Gap and Fox Gap, emphasizing the difficulty of mountainous terrain and the seesaw nature of the battle into which reinforcements continue to trickle and the effects of officer casualties. The game uses simple mechanics to simulate movement, artillery, cavalry, leaders, and difficult terrain, with a unique combat system that allows the game to move quickly while still simulating the tense nature of the battle.<br/><br/><br/>Game scale<br/>Unit size: Brigades<br/>Game Turn: represents 1 hour<br/>Hex Scale:300 yds per hex<br/>Playtime: 2 and 1/2 to 3 hours<br/>Complexity: Low to Moderate<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Brusilov Offensive<br/>Imperial Russia's Last Campaign, 1916<br/><br/>In mid-May 1916, the Allies were faced with two crises.  At Verdun the French army was gradually being bled to death, and in Trentino, the Italian army was rapidly nearing its breaking point.  As in August 1914, the Allies sent out a call of au secours to the Russians.<br/><br/>The Russians responded on 4 June with an offensive along the entire line of General Brusilov's Southwest Front.  This operation resulted in the capture of some 150,000 square miles of territory, inflicted losses of over 3/4 million, and force the Central Powers to weaken their offensives.  As great as it was, however, the Brusilov Offensive was not the strategically decisive victory the Russians needed to stave off internal collapse.  In the game the Russian player must break through the Central Powers line and encircle masses of enemy troops, while the Central Powers Player must make careful withdrawals and timely counterattacks.  For both Players, the game is demanding and requires coherent planning and careful execution.<br/><br/>",

A short game, not only for the break between two lectures. Printed on ecological hemp cloth. Unusually packed in a silver aluminum cylinder. Limited Edition.<br/>   <br/>The special reason for using hemp cloth for the board was a word joke (hemp = Hanf in German): Hanfried == Han(f)fried == Hanf-Fried. The price of the game was exactly 15.58 Euro, motivated by the year 1558 when Jena University was founded.<br/> Information from the designer: I realized one very personal copy with wooden board (instead of hemp cloth) where the (neutral) Hanfried piece is a real silver coin. Two pictures of this item are found in the picture gallery.<br/><br/>",

The game is designed to be played by two teams, but it can also be played by four individual players. The goal is to be the first to get four Touchstones by answering trivia questions correctly. The game includes 2,000 trivia questions in four categories. Book of Mormon, Bible, Hymns, and Prophets/Prophecy. Categories are chosen by rolling a die (which the game refers to as the &quot;perfect polyhedron.&quot;<br/><br/>In the basic version of the game, players need only collect four touchstones to win. In the advanced version, players need to collect one touchstone from each category.<br/><br/>The answers to all questions are referenced to the scripture or hymn they come from so that players can study subjects they didn't know.<br/><br/>The author originally wanted to reprint Celestial Pursuit, but felt that the questions and rules were too complex for family play so he created 3P2K instead.<br/><br/>From the Publisher:<br/>&quot;3P2K has long been on the mind of one of Celestial Pursuit's authors. Realizing from his own family the need for Gospel-based alternatives to the modern world's fast-paced entertainments, the author created Plain &amp; Precious Parts 2000, or 3P2K.<br/><br/>The 1984 version of Celestial Pursuit seemed too difficult and timebound in its adult questions and too complex in its rules to simply be reprinted. 3P2K was therefore created to best serve LDS families in the year 2000 and beyond by emphasizing gospel principles and naturally creating opportunities for doctrinal discussion.<br/><br/>By focusing on four basic areas of Gospel knowledge (Bible, Book of Mormon, Hymns, Prophets &amp; Prophecy), 3P2K simplifies question content and lends timelessness to referenced answers. Specific attention was given to the idea of plain &amp; precious parts of doctrine as the questions were written. Many questions are based on truths learned from the Joseph Smith Translation of the Bible and from footnote references in the LDS Scriptures. Providing both adult and child cards allows family participation from the simplest Sunbeam to the sagest scriptorian.&quot;<br/><br/>Related game:<br/><br/>    Celestial Pursuit<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Experience the adventure and romance of Isle Royale National Park...yesterday and today!&quot;<br/><br/>This game provides players the opportunity to explore the geography and history of IRNP as a boardgame.  It's a standard roll-and-move format, on a large 14x40 inch roll-up board.  All players start at one end of the island.  Four dice (provided) are rolled, and players use the value on a single die or pairs of dice to see if they can equal the mileage to proceed to the next location.  Water routes are sometimes available, and you can use those if you roll trips or a four-straight in three rolls, Yahtzee-fashion.  There are penalties for being landed on.<br/><br/>The locations are campgrounds, scenic sights, fire lookouts, etc., with each type worth so many points to the player landing there or passing by.  Points are tallied on a provided pad with a provided pencil.  Some sights allowed the drawing of a Fortune Card, which can add or subtract additional points.<br/><br/>The board is very attractive and informative, and the four pawns with the game are solid copper lathe-turned figures.  I imagine the game-play might be just a notch above the average roll-and-move, due to the complexity of the path network, the varying values of the stops, and the &quot;Can't Stop&quot;-ish dice selection mechanic.<br/><br/>",

The game comes with two sets of cards and figures. The cards can be creatures or spells. Each creature card has an associated figure that can be played in the board. The board is composed by 6 modular boards which must be placed at the beginning of the game: forest, ice, desert, swamp, lake and plain. The position in which they are placed is very relevant, since the creatures abilities are affected by the kind of landscape they are standing in.<br/>The object of the game is to be the first one in defeating the adversary&rsquo;s leader, which is protected by 2 gemstones and his army.<br/><br/>Eprion is not just a game. It comes with a very well written book with the story of this world where you can learn about the story of almost every character of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is set during World War Two, where you are a German tank commander who has to get his battle-worn tank safely back to friendly faces. The only way back is through a small village, but this contains elements of enemy infantry.<br/><br/>It is a card driven game, and there are two types of card. Terrain cards, which is the pack you are trying to go through as quickly as possible, where the last card is always the Bridge card. There are also Event cards which mainly contain enemy soldiers. Each card has an activation number, the activation level is decided by shuffling activation cards into the Terrain deck. So the further into the village you go the more likely you are to meet enemy opposition.<br/><br/>You give orders to your crew, spending order points. Example: prepare main tank gun, load main tank gun, move turret, observe etc. Your tank creates noise which attracts enemy soldiers and the terrain you move over may also have a bearing on this as well.<br/><br/>Combat is a series of dice rolls, not everyone's favourite part of the game but most wargamers will be okay with this. Also included are the use of Sch&uuml;rzen (side skirts), Zimmerit paste, PIAT attacks, a Sherman, and tank traps.<br/><br/>",

Pharaoh is dying, and, in a break from tradition, has decided that he will name an heir who will best serve Egypt's interests rather than hand the nation over to his handsome but rather dim-witted first-born son. Each player is the leader of a powerful Egyptian Noble Family with the ambition to rise to the level of Pharaoh. Rival Families will provide stiff competition, and all will have to contend with the force of nature that dictates the pattern of Egyptian life -- the River Nile. In flood the Nile can provide increased harvests but may also damage structures, whereas severe drought will cause starvation and suffering.<br/><br/>Pharaoh has issued several decrees. He demands a great harvest, sufficient people to build yet another mighty monument to himself upon his death (most likely a pyramid, although occasionally the Pharaohs preferred big cat-like things), as well as in increase in the worship of (read: sacrifice to) his favorite gods. In return for excelling in these areas of ancient Egyptian life, Pharaoh is willing to make you his heir. Oh, yes, one last thing -- Pharaoh also rewards the Families that develop the most valuable buildings and the most desirable land districts...<br/><br/>Rules can be found on the Piecepack Wiki.<br/><br/>Game System<br/><br/>    Piecepack Game System<br/><br/><br/>",

As a chief, you have to earn your right to rest in that pyramid. Free as many souls as you can to obtain your last sleep's place.<br/><br/>Each player has a chief and two slaves. The chief moves very slowly but can steal collected souls from other player's slaves. The slaves are fast and can collect souls to bring them to their chief. But the pyramid's maze is changing with every turn and your just-so-well-constructed escape-way is not blocked. Keep cool, because the more souls you deliver to your chief at once, the more score. But be warned: If you're too greedy, it may be over too fast and you'll end up with nothing.<br/><br/>Aztekz is a very complex collecting-game with very simple rules and a lot of strategic possibilities.

Each British base or stand represents a formation of 100 men while the French are formed in bases or stands of 150 men.<br/><br/>&ldquo;The battle for Quebec 1759 was a part of the Seven Years War in North America between the England and France. The British General Wolfe sailed up the St Lawrence River with over 250 ships and boats in late June of 1759 from the fortress Louisbourg. The British knew very little about the City of Quebec, which they sent General Wolfe to attack, other than that the city was the capital of New France.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;When General Wolfe and his soldiers landed on the Isle d' Orleans they discovered that the City of Quebec sat on top of a 350 foot cliff over looking the St Lawrence River . . . On September 13th General Wolfe made the amphibious landing that led his soldiers up to the Plains of Abraham. The whale boats and flat bottom barges took Wolfe's 4,800 men over in two trips. When General Montcalm woke in the morning he found out that the British were just outside the City on the Plains of Abraham.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The designer&rsquo;s foreward notes: &ldquo;Not all of the rules listed below apply to this battle. These rules were written to be a general set of rules to cover the entire musket era of warfare.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;The battle for Quebec can be looked at in three different view points. These three view points are the campaign for Quebec, the greater battle for Quebec, and the lesser battle for Quebec.

        "description": "Fourth entry in the Battles of Middle Ages series, featuring the battles of Benevento 1266 AD and Tagliacozzo 1268 AD, opposing the lasts of the Hohenstaufen against Charles of Anjou, champion of the Pope.<br/><br/>Battles of the Middle Ages is an easy to learn war gaming system that recreates several of the most famous battles of the Medieval period of history, from the end of the Dark Ages to the dawning of Renaissance. These games are designed to be fast and furious, easy to learn, and to play but with enough historical research to make them true to the history.<br/><br/>Benevento, 1266<br/>The battle of Benevento is one of the most important battles of the long, vicious struggle of strength between the Papacy and the Ghibellin dynasty of the Hohenstaufen family. After the death of Frederic II, King of the Two Sicilies his bastard son, Manfredi d&rsquo;Altavilla, raised an army against Pope Clement IV. After a fierce battle, Manfredi was defeated and died in battle. He was made immortal by Dante Alighieri, who put him in Purgatory and said of him &ldquo;Biondo era, e bello, e di nobile aspetto&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Tagliacozzo, 1268<br/>This battle may be considered the end of the Ghibellines, with the defeat of the last heir of the Hohenstaufen family, Conradin of Svabia. Similar to the earlier battle of Beneventor, it was mostly a clash of knights, resolved by the cunning of Charles of Anjou, who was not reluctant to sacrifice two-thirds of his army to surprise the Ghibellins who thought they had already won the battle before it was even fought (and acted accordingly).<br/><br/>Originally, available only as print &amp; play through Wargamesdownloads.com.<br/>A second edition was published by High Flying Dice Games. The rules were extensively re-written for clarity and bring into compliance with the other games in the Battles of the Middle Ages Series. The Benevento game has a new variant scenario. In addition, the second edition features new artwork<br/><br/>",

Depending on his quality he will have a certain number of command points (variable by dice roll) to use in that turn. Easy things take few command points, more complex things take more points.<br/><br/>The rules are designed to play quickly, each scale ten minute turn should, with a couple of games under your belt, take no more than ten minutes of real time, so there will be less down time than many &quot;IGOUGO&quot; rule systems.<br/><br/>",

If a player runs into a Police Dog (again, literally a dog dressed like a police officer) or triggers the alarm, they lose a life. Lose 9 lives, and it's game-over for that player. The first player to remove the jewels from the safe wins.<br/><br/>The game uses a roll-and-move mechanic. On his turn, a player rolls the dice, and may then decide either to move his Cat Burglar, or to move one of the two Police Dogs.<br/><br/>The board is assembled from four large puzzle-piece shaped segments, which depict various rooms inside the mansion. A plastic dial is inserted into each corner of the board, which players use to track lives. A fifth board section, made from plastic, depicts the vault room, and sits in the middle of the board. This section has a safe which the players must crack, and several of the spaces on the middle section are alarmed.<br/><br/>The key feature of the game is the plastic &quot;vault room&quot; which sits in the middle of the board. All the spaces in the vault room are potentially alarmed - There are small metal contacts embedded in each space. Some of them are decoys, and some will trigger an alarm when the metal base of the cat burglar pieces comes into contact, completing an electronic circuit. The safe itself is a dexterity mini-game; although players are given the combination for the lock at the start of the game, if their hand shakes, or they get the combination slightly wrong, it triggers an alarm.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/><br/>4 Mansion Room puzzle-piece board sections<br/>4 Coloured plastic Cat Burglar pieces with a metal base<br/>2 Plastic Police Dog pieces<br/>4 Plastic Gems (one of each player colour)<br/>4 Plastic dials for tracking lives (one of each player colour)<br/>1 Plastic vault room plus battery cover<br/>1 Plastic safe core plus lid<br/>Dice<br/>Rulebook<br/><br/>",

The game covers American Revolution conflict in the Northern colonies from July 1775 through potentially December of 1779.  Voluntary combat for adjacent units, with volley combat being decided on a matrix table weighing unit types and total strength factors against a die roll (similar to Lou Zocchi's Luftwaffe combat table).  Additional &quot;bayonet&quot; combat also possible, based upon net relative strengths of attacker/defender, with terrain and die roll bonuses.<br/><br/>Advanced rules allow for &quot;command counters&quot; to replace units on the map, allowing for unknown unit strength.<br/><br/>According to the designer notes published within the magazine, the game was a prototype design being prepared for Avalon Hill, and CONFLICT Magazine was being authorized to distribute it &quot;...to assure that the test version will appear with a minimum of error and/or distortion.  We want your assistance in making this the kind of game which belongs in the Avalon Hill lineup.&quot;  The subscribers and other play testers were encouraged to submit their critiques of the game to Lou Zocchi, and the six best would receive copies of the final game published by Avalon Hill.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The train car you are on has broken away from the rest of the train, slowed to a stop, and now is heading back down the hill, towards the Train Station that's overlooking a canyon. The car is barely moving, but seems to be picking up speed, the smart thing to do would be to jump now...but, there still some time and the car is not moving that fast yet, you are sure you can toss off some your suitcases (with all your ill-gotten gains) before you have to jump. Too bad the other passengers seem to have the same idea.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to score the most points by getting  your suitcases off the train car. Suitcases have a point value from 1-7 points. There are also bonuses and score multipliers that can increase the points earned. You will at some point want to get your passenger off the train, because if the train does crash (which is very, very likely) you don't want to be on it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This supplement to the game Hammerin' Iron (1992) describes itself as more of an expansion than a rewrite.  It is intended to be played with 1/600 scale miniatures, although conversions to other scales would be relatively straightforward.<br/><br/>Hammerin' Iron 2 is a set of rules designed to covers river conflicts of the American Civil War, 1861 to 1865.<br/><br/>This rules system uses a hex movement system that is described as original to Peter Pig.  This system requires that each ship miniature be placed upon a 5.5&quot; hexagon cutout.  The hexagons are used as a 'floating' hex grid radiating from each ship miniature.  These hexes offer the ease of a hex grid in regulating movement, but since rotations of odd angles (for example, 34 or 52 degrees rotation) are possible, this system is free of the constraints of a traditional grid which would limit ships to 60 degree rotations.<br/><br/>Combat is based on a dice-pool system, in which to-hit modifiers affect the number of dice rolled. Each dice result of 5 or 6 (on a d6) is a potential hit, which is then tested against armor deflection. Potential hits not successfully deflected score hull hits.<br/><br/>A major change in this rules system compared to the first edition is the omission of the ship schematics and crew counters (in which individual crew counters were moved about the ship to allocate crew to various ship functions).  However, if one views Hammerin' Iron 2 as an &quot;expansion&quot; rather than &quot;rewrite&quot;, then one is open to include the crew and schematic rules from 1st edition in the Hammerin' Iron 2 rules.<br/><br/>Equipment (in addition to the rules) required for play include:<br/><br/>     Ship models (1/600 scale preferred)<br/>     approximately 12 hexagons cut from 5.5-inch plastic or cardboard circles<br/>     approximately 16 six-sided dice<br/>     cardstock or felt cutouts to represent sandbars, shallows, shorelines etc<br/>     cotton (white or black) to represent damage to ships<br/>     notepaper and pencil<br/>     order cards (can be cut from rulebook, or alternatively prepared from cardstock)<br/><br/><br/>",

These &quot;scorecards&quot; form the board.<br/>The cards A-K-Q-J-10-9-8-7-6 from the other deck are shuffled and each player is dealt 12 cards. They reveal one of them simultaneously. If two or three are of the same suit then that suit is trump. If all three are different then the trump suit is the fourth one - that is, the suit that nobody chose. However, if any two are of the same rank then the hand is played at no trump.<br/>Then tricks are played, and at the end of the play players puts a counters on the scorecards representing the number of tricks they won (Queen represents 0). If it's occupied by an opponent's counter, return it to its owner and substitute one of your own, if two of you win the same number, and the appropriate scorecard is either blank or occupied by the third player, leave it unchanged.<br/>You win a game by finishing with three counters in a row, whether horizontally, vertically or diagonally, after everyone has recorded their score. If two or all three players achieve this simultaneously, the winner is the player whose line of three cards has the highest total face value.<br/><br/>",

The sequence, which represents the events that would take place in about the amount of time it would take a typical gun crew in the 18th century to load and fire a large cannon, is repeated until the victory conditions of one side have been achieved, or all the ships of one side have been lost or have fled.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zomboree is a large group social card game (6 - 16 people) where players take on the roles of various survivors in a town under seige by zombies.  Each turn is affected by an event card drawn for that day.  Each turn is divided into two phases: Day and Night.  A 90 second timer is provided with the game to provide a  fair length for both phases.<br/><br/>During setup, survivor cards will be handed out.  One of the survivors will be Patient Zero and become a zombie at the end of the first day.  Each survivor starts with one item.  After everyone has an item, the group elects their leader.  Since no one knows anyone else's role, it is possible to elect Patient Zero as the group's leader.  Anytime the leader becomes a zombie, the survivors must elect a new leader before beginning the day phase.<br/><br/>During the day the elected leader of the survivors draws resource cards and the survivors discuss how to divide them up.  Some of the Survivors, however, are infected and will eventually join the Zombies attacking the Survivors.  At the end of each day, players check their character cards to see if they have become a zombie.<br/><br/>During the night, the players who have become zombies play attack cards of various types against the remaining survivors.  The survivors must work together to defend themselves using the resources they found during the day to resist and shunt off zombie attacks in order to survive.  Those who cannot stop or deflect a zombie attack, become zombies who will get a zombie attack card the next night.<br/><br/>The game's scenario runs for one week's time, from Sunday to Saturday.  Each turn an event card shapes both the day and night phases.  Each day the survivors use their drawn resources to make a plan for resisting the zombies.  Each night the zombies attack the survivors and try to wipe them out.  The game ends after the night phase on Saturday when those still alive win by surviving the zombie apocalypse, or else when all survivors are   dead (or undead, as it were).<br/><br/>",

(2) it can move one square on the rank or file and then while still moving away from the square from which it started, moves one square on the diagonals. This is not a line move but a move from point to point and can not be obstructed by any other piece. See figure 1.<br/><br/>THE JESTER- Moves one or two squares on the diagonals. Unlike the Bishop the Jester can change directions while in motion, if desired. It may not return to the square from which it stared in the same move. See figure 2. For the first move from its initial square the jester may jump two square diagonally. All pieces with the exception of the Pawn, capture in the way it can legally move.<br/><br/>The King is also afforded an additional special move;<br/><br/>KING'S FLIGHT- is a move made by the King when in check by the Chancellor.

Every square has a matching tile; tiles are drawn when a player takes his turn. On his turn he also has to answer a question about Austria, drawn from the deck of trivia cards. If he answers correctly, he puts that tile on the corresponding space on the board and moves his pawn forward. As soon as all tiles are on the board, the game is over and the player whose pawn has advanced the most spaces is the winner. <br/>Special tiles award extra points or penalties to the drawing player. There are two types of questions - the blue ones are easy and the red ones are hard. Players have to agree which set they want to use.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battles by Gaslight is based on the popular Gaslight Victorian science fiction rules, but is designed to allow players to fight larger battles with several players each controlling four or more units.  Game mechanics have been streamlined to allow players to control more units; however, the flavor of Gaslight has been retained.  48 pages.<br/><br/>Units in Gaslight generally consist of ten figures led by one or more Main Characters, in Battles by Gaslight this is expanded so that a player will control three or four entire units each led by a (Main Character) Commander which are in turn led by an overall Army Commander. A player may also control vehicles and their crews. The games are a combination of unit actions and individual heroism in the tradition of adventure novels and swashbuckling films.<br/><br/>Command and control is accomplished now through a combination die roll and card-draw turn system. Movement is based on moving entire units as they activate, keeping them within distance of their Commander. Firing is done by units as a whole now instead of individual figures like in Gaslight (although Main Character Commanders may fire separately) and the firing procedure is still very streamlined. Morale is handled in a similar fashion to Gaslight with minor adjustments.<br/><br/>The authors made the specific design choice not to build their own world for these rules.  Instead the rules allow for the use of any vehicles, weapons, and creatures that players desire for their personal perception of Victorian science fiction.<br/><br/>",

Can you successfully get the Olympics buildings built on time, and turn a profit on the investment?<br/><br/>Players start with an unimproved city on a 20 x 20 grid, and must plan for the construction of 6 Olympic Complexes, housing for the athletes, hotels for the fans, all while trying to improve the mood of the city.<br/><br/>The player must evaluate locations based upon the price of the property, the proximity to other locations, and in reaction to 10 random event cards.  Some events describe extra unforeseen costs, while others provide revenue generating opportunities.<br/><br/>Generating revenue is very important, since the player will acquire a significant debt from the purchase of the properties and costs of construction.

Nevertheless, the intersection of the Tsar&rsquo;s domain, Austro-Hungarian territory and the Ottoman Empire was a nexus of instability fuelled by long standing ethnic and religious differences as much as foreign policies.<br/><br/>Aeronef Over The Aegean: Wrath of the Syren is a mini-campaign of linked Aeronef scenarios following the adventures of Hungarian Baron Lantoz as he takes his flagship, the Syren, on a mission of vengeance, against the Turks, for his slain family.<br/><br/>The three scenarios provided will present different challenges to both players: The Hungarian player must preserve his ship and crew from one battle to the next, choosing which engagements to pursue and which to avoid. The Turkish player must battle through some deliberately unbalanced scenarios initially, keeping an eye on the overall picture. The scenarios themselves are short with limited numbers of vessels, enabling players to resolve this mini-campaign in a single evening.<br/><br/>",

Straight from the tabloid headlines, these unsolved mysteries, urban legends, and other phenomena are here to be finally solved or debunked by your Investigators.<br/><br/>Assembling your own teams of Paranormal Investigators (or PI's, for short), players must rely on the diverse backgrounds of their PI&rsquo;s to solve a host of strange Case Files. Once solved, these cases can be saved for the end of the game or used to solve larger cases and gain strategic advantages over your opponent.<br/><br/>Players begin the game with only a couple of Investigators and a handful of Paranormal Aid cards. Each PI has their own unique background in various paranormal fields. Certain PI's also have a &quot;Debunk&quot; background, which allows players to attempt to solve a case by debunking it. Paranormal Aids can be used to add a background to a PI or increase it. Players also have the option of using these aids (as well as any solved cases they have) to enlist additional PI's or perform other actions, such as allowing PI's to add their backgrounds through partnering.<br/><br/>Players take turns revealing cases on a Case Files card layout and attempting to solve them. These cases cover many paranormal backgrounds (cryptozoology, unexplained phenomenon, supernatural, extraterrestrial, demonic, and cursed) with five levels for each one. Each level needs the equal and matching background to solve it (for example, a Level 5 Supernatural Case File needs a combined Supernatural background of 5 to solve it). Each level on a Case File also equals the number of points it is worth at the end of the game.<br/><br/>At first, players will only be able to solve a limited number of these cases. But, as they enlist more PI's and use their aids/solved cases, players will slowly be able to solve larger ones. While the larger cases are worth the most towards victory, they also have powerful secondary abilities (like abducting an opponent's PI or stealing one of their solved cases). Players must weigh their options when doing this since cases that have their secondary abilities used are discarded and can't be added to a player's end game total.<br/><br/>The player that does the best job of building their team of Paranormal Investigators and managing the most strategic use of their Paranormal Aids and solved Case Files will end the game with the largest number of combined Case File points and be declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

But these Moos are difficult to capture and you need special tools if you want to stand a chance against the other cowboys who have also discovered The Field.<br/><br/>Pull together 3 tools to specifically utilize against the different types of Moo. You can wield an EMP Rifle to take down Cyborg Moos, or trail Zombie Moos along with a Brain on a Stick. You might need a Steel Stetson to protect yourself against Dragon Moos, a Puzzle Box to trap Ghost Moos and don't leave your Faithful Companion at home, he'll help you round up any Moo you want!<br/><br/>Capture 25 different Moos, or get a pedigree herd of 15 on one type to win against the other cowboys.<br/><br/>This is a game with entry level tactical play. Choices are available in every step. It is meant to be a fun game for anyone to play and accessible to all levels of experience. Specifically, the game is designed to help bring players who have not had much experience with tactical play into the broader gaming market. The steps of the game are as follows:<br/><br/>Rustle:  Draw the top two off of the deck, or one off the discard pile.  If there are not enough cards in the deck, shuffle the discard pile, place it face down and continue.<br/><br/>Round-up:  Wrangle cows and play action cards or sit-a-spell.  If you choose to wrangle or play action cards you may play as many as you are able (including multiple sets of tools).  To sit-a-spell you may discard any number of cards from your hand at once and draw that number from the deck. If you sit-a-spell you may not play cards, and you may not sit-a spell if you have played any cards.<br/><br/>Portal: Roll the Moo Dice.  (A 6 sided die with 1 color for each Moo type and two opposite faces colored black). Place one Moo of each indicated type in the field according to the Moo Placement Rules.  If all four dice show black then a Stampede has occurred.<br/><br/>Mosey:  Move one Moo of each color in the field one space if possible.  If there are no Moos in the field, or if none of the Moos can be moved, then skip this phase.  If there is only one Moo of a color in the field you must still move that Moo.<br/><br/>After the Mosey phase, if you have more than 7 cards in hand, discard in the order you choose until you only have 7.<br/><br/>",

The pawns can move only diagonally, one square at a time in four directions.<br/>2. When two or more opposing pawns are in adjacent squares, then:<br/>        a.

        "description": "In the days when the world was still young, a race appeared full of splendor, dignity and beauty. They lived in harmony with their world and the power of their artifacts flowed through everyone and everything. Thus it happened that they isolated the mysterious essence of time itself and put it in twelve mighty crystals to keep it there. In the center of a hovering island, they created the enormous Citadel of Time where they used the pulsing power of the crystals to find out what was, what is and what will be to change the way of the universe.<br/><br/>For milleniums, this sign was anticipated and dreaded. Darkness fell over the island as two of the four suns eclipsed. The colossuses would come to posses the astral body of their creator. The Citadel of Time would fall...<br/><br/>In Kolossus, each player starts at one corner of the world with five warriors, two guardians, and one mighty colossus, with players pairing into alliances. The creatures have different strengths and abilities to move across the map, and using their abilities wisely is the key to success. With the use of mana, players can enhance their creatures' abilities to make them harder to beat or to hit stronger.<br/><br/>The aim of the players is to reach the Citadel of Time and control it as long as possible because the alliance controlling the Citadel receives a time crystal for every turn it does so. To win, an alliance needs to have the most time crystals at the end of the game or to expel all creatures from one side from the island.<br/><br/>",

In Station Fall, dice represent mining stations that attack their competition while falling through the Martian atmosphere. After landing, these stations work in groups to mine diamonds from specific geological formations. The first player to control six mines wins in this lightly strategic game of dice rolling and area control.<br/><br/>Player turns consist of three phases: Terraforming, Recruiting, and Deployment. Terraforming expands the play area by adding new mineable Tiles to the board. Recruiting new Stations is done by rolling and re-rolling Station Dice; each Tile can only be mined by specific Station Dice combinations, for example: sets, straights, larges, odds, etc. The Deployment phase is when you place your Dice on the board. As Stations are deployed, they attack and possibly destroy enemies in neighboring sectors. Each Tile grants an advantage for either mining or deploying Dice to them. And no turn is ever wasted, with single use Utility Cards that are provided to players who are either unable or unwilling to make a deployment.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Who hasn&rsquo;t been to the toy store or the dollar store and seen the plastic army men and said &ldquo;There has to be a game there&rdquo;?  Well I asked myself that often and finally took the plunge and wrote one.  Originally the game was only army men but I couldn&rsquo;t resist the idea of using cowboys, Indians, and for some odd reason, firemen.  After all we are already playing with plastic dudes, we can include them all!<br/><br/>The basic idea here is to go to the Dollar store, spend less than $10 and have a fun miniatures game for two people.  This doesn't include terrain of course.  I recommend playing at the FLGS!  (buy something when you are there)<br/><br/>All the units are put into a bag and mixed up. The first player pulls a guy out of the bag and decides if he wants to keep him or reject him. Rejected units form a pile (not returned to the bag). If you keep certain units you get a bonus draw (if you keep an Indian you can draw a bonus guy from the bag or from the reject pile). The next player than can pick a unit from the bag OR the reject pile, if they pick from the reject pile they also get a second unit from the reject pile on top of any bonuses the first unit gives. So if I took an Indian from the reject pile I&rsquo;d get to take another unit from the pile AND a unit from the bag or pile, the bonus units do not give extra units however)<br/><br/>Terrain is placed, units are placed near the edge of the table and it&rsquo;s time to play. Basically it goes like this. Both guys flip cards from a deck, face cards are set aside, when the total you flipped equals 10 or more they stop. The total is the number of 6 sided dice they get for the turn. These are assigned to the individual units. Army men can have a maximum of 3 dice for example.<br/><br/>Now players take turns. On your turn you activate one unit. That unit then spends at least one die. The dice are used to move, shoot or perform special actions. Moving units are subject to opportunity fire, units performing opportunity fire are subject to covering fire. Of course these actions cost dice, and that limits what else they can do. Dice are indeed a precious commodity!<br/><br/>Remember those removed face cards? They are used to activate special powers and leadership powers. Your special power is determined by what the majority of your units are. Mainly army men? You get the artillery strike! Mainly Cowboys? You get the high noon duel! Leadership powers include healing, damage reduction and group fire. Another tough decision is how to spend those face cards!<br/><br/>The round ends when all the dice are spent. First check to see if any unit has died (taken enough wounds). Yes you don&rsquo;t realize you are dead until the end of the round. Well you can be killed outright during the round but you get to spend all your dice on a retaliatory strike! No dice are wasted! (except for all those ones I rolled) Next you check victory, if you roll a singe d6 and its higher then the total number of guys you have left your army runs away! It&rsquo;s possible that both armies run away on the same turn. Then no one wins, or both people do, fight about it.<br/><br/>",

The smaller board consists of 37 cells, four to each side of the larger hexagon. The larger board consists of 61 cells, five to each of the larger hexagon&rsquo;s sides.  Both boards are set between two players with a point closest to each player.  On the smaller board, each player has 13 pieces, arranged on every cell of their half of the board, with a row of vacant cells in the middle.  Likewise on the larger board, but with 24 pieces per player.<br/><br/>Other than the varying boards and arrangement of pieces, the difference between Pskov and Shashki is in the promotion of pieces; in Pskov Checkers, pieces can only be promoted on the farthest corner cell, closest to the opponent, rather than the furthest row as in Hexdame.<br/><br/>",

It's a paper and pencil game for 1 or 2 players simulating a game of American Football. All you need to play is something to write on and something to write with. That means it's free!<br/><br/>The game is played in 4 quarters. Each quarter consists of a player taking a turn on offense and on defense. Offense always starts at their opponent's 35 yard line.<br/><br/>Offense: You have 4 downs to score. Write the appropriate letters in a 6-digit code to represent your play:<br/>Run = three 'R's <br/>Pass = two 'P's<br/>Hail-Mary = three 'P's<br/>Field Goal = one, two, or three 'F's (depending on field position: &gt;30, 10 - 30, &lt;10 yard line)<br/><br/>Defense: Without seeing your opponent's play, choose 3 distinct numbers between 1 and 6. These are the left-to-right digits in the offense's play that you block this down.<br/><br/>A run is successful and moves the offense 10 yards if at least two 'R's are unblocked. <br/>A pass is successful and moves the offense 20 yards if both 'P's are unblocked.<br/>A hail-mary is successful and results in an instant touchdown if all 3 'P's are unblocked.<br/>A field goal is successful if at least 1 'F' is unblocked.<br/><br/>If you score a touchdown you can attempt a field goal from the 5 yard line or attempt a 2-point conversion from the 5 yard line.<br/><br/>",

With everyone playing at once, players place one or more fuel balls on their landing pad, place their spinner ship over these balls, then moves their ship in circles so quickly that centrifugal force holds the balls up and doesn't let them fall through the hole in the bottom of the spinner ship. Place your ship on top of the mother ship and let your fuel balls fall inside; if someone else places a spinner on top of yours, you're pinned until their fuel is loaded, so you want to get in and out as quickly as possible &mdash; but that's tricky to do because if you don't spin your ship quickly, your fuel will eject before you've reached the mother ship!<br/><br/>If you drop a ball, you pick it up, then place it on your landing pad later for another go.

They seek out and attack other OpFor and MERCS.<br/><br/>The Infected have a chance to turn other OpFor into Infected. Infected OpFor are replaced with special Infected OpFor cards and are marked with a token. Infected OpFor have altered priorities and do different things. The mini-campaign in Blood Contagion revolves around the MERCS going deep into a lab, finding the cure, not letting the Infected get out-of-hand, and saving as many Infected as possible.<br/><br/>Additionally, the Infected bring with them a completely new way for the MERCS to lose: if ever there are 15 Infected in the structure the MERCS have been defeated.<br/><br/>This Mission Pack is a Myth Crossover. The Infected can also be used as Minions in Myth.<br/><br/>The Infected Minions are tough to kill. They have 3 Vitality. On a successful attack, the Infected roll a 1FD. If the Infected rolls the Darkness symbol, the Hero cannot produce treasure. Additionally, if that Hero while infected becomes adjacent to other Heroes, then the infected Hero rolls 1FD for each Hero adjacent. If the roll matches the defining attribute, then the adjacent Hero becomes infected and can no longer generate treasure either.<br/><br/>",

Action cards and team placards have unique actions and abilities.<br/><br/>The Collector's Edition box also has an Embossed foil stamp on the cover and is signed and numbered.  There will only be 300 units of this version ever manufactured.<br/><br/><br/>In Thrash-Car, you build your racing team from the ground up. As the team owner, you choose your crew, car, and strategy, then help them drive their way to victory in some of the wildest and toughest race conditions you have ever seen.<br/><br/>Each driver is trying to get around the track and survive it. The track is made of random cards drawn from the track deck, and each card has a target attribute, a target number, and a damage value. The attribute determines that base attribute from your car you are using to build your base roll modifier. The target number is the number you have to roll on a ten-sided die or greater to succeed and move to the next track space. Damage is how much damage your car takes if you fail your roll.<br/><br/>When you go to move, the other drivers can play up to one card on your action stack (this is the screw your neighbor part). The draw deck plays one card, then you can play up to two on yourself. These cards will result in a modifier for your roll to move. You add or subtract that number from your car's base and roll the die. If you make the target you move ahead and keep racing; if you fail you take the listed damage and try to keep racing. Fail too many rolls, and your car will be destroyed. You are always trying to get ahead and your friends are always trying to drag you down.<br/><br/>At times, the drivers can beat on each other with their cars and roll head-to-head to see who is better in these exchanges, but if you get outrolled you can take some serious damage. If you do the outrolling, though, you can hammer the other guy and leap ahead in the race.<br/><br/>You win Thrash-Car by being the first to complete the designated laps or being the last car running on the track.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Franky is back!<br/>In a secret laboratory, the players try to assemble as many Frankies as possible and then activate them with lightning flashes. Only energy charged Frankies can score in the game.<br/>Not every Franky is the same, the risky &rsquo;small&rsquo; red Frankies can win the most victory points ..<br/><br/>excerpt of the official rules: <br/>The object of the game is to win 12 victory points or more. The highest number of victory points wins the game. In case of a tie of victory points a flash-duel (between the affected players) takes place in a special round. Note: Victory point is a funny reference to the fictional character Victor Frankenstein.<br/>How to play: Each game round the player has a regular dice turn with multiple number of rolls. After each roll, any number of dice can be laid aside, but at least 1 die is always required! Dice which are laid aside cannot be re-rolled in this round. At the end of the regular dice turn (all dice are laid aside) the result is evaluated. A lightning flash symbolizes a victory point, but only if the player can assemble a complete Franky in a same color (2 other dice in green or according violet). A green or violet Franky is always assembled with a head and a body.<br/>Note: If you want to achieve a regular victory point this way, always 3 dice are necessary.<br/>Red Frankies: After the player has completed his regular dice turn (all dice are laid aside), all red Frankies are rolled once again. Here the player has gained special chances with these dice. A red Franky can immediately achieve victory points if he shows a flash after the rolling (the red Franky has been activated). Here no assembly with other dice is required because the red Franky is already complete (custom-made). Displays the die (after the roll) again a red Franky, he will be re-rolled again, all other symbols do not help anymore.<br/>Note: If the player wins victory points this way, only 1 single die is necessary. Depending on how many red Frankies the player has laid aside, a lot of victory points can be earned.<br/><br/>excerpt of the official rules Blue Eyes (included first expansion): <br/>The player can try to score victory points as usual. If he plays a total of victory points that is similar with the number the blue spot die shows, the victory points can be doubled. Note: The player can decide to devaluate any number of victory points to fulfill the spot die (only<br/>complete activated Frankies can be devaluated).<br/><br/><br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Franky ist zur&uuml;ck!<br/>Im geheimen Labor versuchen die Spieler m&ouml;glichst viele Frankys zusammenzubauen und diese dann mit Energieblitzen zu aktivieren. Nur energiegeladene Frankys k&ouml;nnen im Spiel punkten. <br/>Nicht jeder Franky ist gleich, die riskanten &bdquo;kleinen&rdquo; roten Frankys k&ouml;nnen die meisten Siegpunkte erspielen ..<br/><br/>Auszug des offiziellen Regelwerks:<br/>Spielziel sind 12 Siegpunkte oder mehr. Die h&ouml;chste Anzahl an Siegpunkten gewinnt das Spiel. Bei Gleichstand von Siegpunkten wird ein Blitz-Duell in einer Sonderrunde ausgetragen.<br/>Spiel&uuml;berblick: Pro Spielrunde hat der Spieler einen regul&auml;ren W&uuml;rfeldurchgang mit mehreren W&uuml;rfen. Nach jedem Wurf k&ouml;nnen beliebig viele W&uuml;rfel rausgelegt werden, mindestens 1 W&uuml;rfel ist aber immer Pflicht! Rausgelegte W&uuml;rfel k&ouml;nnen in dieser Runde nicht wieder neu mitgew&uuml;rfelt werden. Erst am Ende des regul&auml;ren W&uuml;rfeldurchgangs (alle W&uuml;rfel sind rausgelegt) wird das Ergebnis gewertet. Ein Energieblitz bedeutet einen Siegpunkt, welcher aber erst durch den Zusammenbau von einem Franky in einer gleichen Farbe (2 andere W&uuml;rfel in gr&uuml;n oder entsprechend violett) gewertet werden kann. Ein gr&uuml;ner oder violetter Franky wird immer zusammengebaut mit Kopf und Rumpf.<br/>Hinweis: Soll auf diese Weise ein regul&auml;rer Siegpunkt erzielt werden, sind daf&uuml;r immer 3 W&uuml;rfel notwendig.<br/>Rote Frankys: Nachdem der Spieler seinen regul&auml;ren W&uuml;rfeldurchgang abgeschlossen hat (alle W&uuml;rfel sind rausgelegt), werden alle roten Frankys einmalig erneut gew&uuml;rfelt; der Spieler hat sich bei diesen W&uuml;rfeln Sonderchancen erspielt. Ein roter Franky kann sofort Siegpunkte erzielen, wenn er jetzt nach dem w&uuml;rfeln einen Energieblitz zeigt (der rote Franky wurde aktiviert). Hier ist kein Zusammenbau mit anderen W&uuml;rfeln erforderlich, da die roten Frankys schon komplett sind (Sonderanfertigungen). Zeigt der W&uuml;rfel (nach dem w&uuml;rfeln) erneut einen roten Franky, wird dieser als Wiederholung erneut gew&uuml;rfelt, alle anderen Symbole bringen nichts mehr.<br/>Hinweis: Sollen also so Siegpunkte erspielt werden, ist hierf&uuml;r nur 1 einziger W&uuml;rfel notwendig. Auf diese Weise k&ouml;nnen beliebig viele Siegpunkte erspielt werden, je nachdem wie viele rote Frankys der Spieler rausgelegt hat.<br/><br/>Auszug des offiziellen Regelwerks Blue Eyes (enthaltene erste Erweiterung):<br/>Der Spieler kann ganz normal auf Siegpunkte spielen. Schafft er es jedoch genau so viele Siegpunkte zu erspielen, wie der Augenw&uuml;rfel zeigt, k&ouml;nnen die Siegpunkte verdoppelt werden.<br/>Hinweis: Der Spieler kann sich entscheiden Siegpunkte verfallen zu lassen (nur komplett aktivierte Frankys k&ouml;nnen verfallen), damit der Augenw&uuml;rfel erf&uuml;llt werden kann.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Glorious Fall is a dynamic, competitive/cooperative game with minimized luck. It recreates the entire epic lifespan of the Byzantine Empire, from the founding by Constantine the Great to its last gasp (or not, if you manage to keep it intact).<br/><br/>During play your Dynasty will be given a choice of secret destinies, such as keeping the empire alive, destroying it, or controlling the Basileus through two consecutive Eras, etc., and a number of Byzantine Plot cards to use when you choose. The map consists of the Themes of the Empire, with three &quot;resources&quot; contained in each: people, religious ferver, and commerce.<br/><br/>The game is won by the family accumulating the most Glory Points by the end of the final era in any combination of three ways: fulfilling your Dynasty's unique, secret destinies, developing the Themes (regions) within the empire, and shaping the empire to suit your purposes while denying other's their revealed plans.<br/><br/>Your family will dominate various roles throughout the game: Basileus (Emperor), Logothete (Administrator), Patriarch, Strategos (General), or Katepano (control the mobs of Constantinople). Each title grants limited political power, forcing cooperation, but each can seize unlimited political power at various times when Byzantine Plots are revealed and anyone can suddenly seize control of the Basileus' actions, or even the throne itself.<br/><br/>Roles switch when players reveal plots of various strengths by using Byzantine Plot cards. In essence assassinating the Emperor in favor of their own candidate; misleading an Army sent to defend Jerusalem, convincing it to go to Cilicia instead; or denying the Basileus the power to hand out political favors, instead forcing him to divide the power as your dynasty sees fit.<br/><br/>Each family (player) has only so much political power to expend at any time, and must choose when to intervene and when to let the Basileus (or another family) have their way.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the Empire faces Barbarian invasions from its borders, and possible rebellions from within. Players will create alliances that may last or end before ever begun as nefarious plots are revealed. The Basileus may see Crusades or merchant enclaves rise up to restore parts of the Empire or betray the Empire and sack the Queen of Cities.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kaiju Conquest is a strategy wargame depicting the battle for Earth in 2116 AD, with the First Inter-Species War between the humans of the United Earth Reaction Force (UERF), and the reptilian Sazzarran Empire.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to have the most Victory Points based on control of damaged or non-damaged city and land zones by the end of game round five.<br/><br/>The initial invasion began in the Pacific Ocean and its bordering coastlines, which is also portrayed on the game board. There are 15 major coastal city zones and 7 land zones, which were involved in the war of the Pacific Campaign. The cities are beautifully illustrated by the artist, Becca T-R.<br/><br/>The game contains eight Mecha characters of eight different designs well as 8 kaiju characters of eight different species, including the Warlord, who is the Supreme Commander of the Sazarran invasion force. Fighting along with and supporting the mecha are Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine forces combined into a common Military Unit (MU). The Sazzarran have their own version of Army, Air, Sea and other special units, also combined as a Military Unit. The UERF also have access to nukes and the Sazzarran have bio-bombs.<br/><br/>There are five game rounds. In each game round the players will receive a fixed number of Resource Points to build their MUs and respective Mecha and Kaiju. Each game round the Resource Points are two points less than the previous game round, starting with 15 points and ending with seven points. At the beginning of each game round, the players may also have received extra Resource Points by destroying the opposing players forces.<br/><br/>There are five phases during each game round.<br/> 1. Maintenance Phase: One of the players will move the hexagonal game round token to the next game round hex space. Both sides will then collect the number of Resource Points (RPs) as shown below the current game round number.<br/><br/>2. Draw Phase: Both sides randomly draw six cards from their respective Tactic Card decks. These cards can be used during the Draw, Resource, Movement and Battle Phases to give bonuses respectively to each of those phases. The Sazzarran player then draws four Target Zone Cards. These cards display a particular city, a land or a sea zone. The Sazzarran player chooses two of the cards and the other two are discarded under the Target Zone deck. The two chosen cards will be the zones where the Sazzarran MUs and Kaiju will deploy.<br/><br/>3. Resource Phase: The UERF will purchase their MECHA and MUs as well as any Nukes for the current game round, based on the number of RPs available. The Sazzarran will also be purchasing their Kaiju and MUs. The Sazzarran will also be deciding which zones the Kaiju and MUs will deployed into during the Movement Phase.<br/><br/>4. Movement Phase: The Sazzarran deploys their forces first at the designated target zones. If there are any UERF units in the zones, the Sazzarran must leave one MU for each UERF MU in the zone. Mecha and Kaiju can freely move between zones within their movement allowance, unless there is an opposing Mecha or Kaiju in the zone. If the zone is unoccupied, the Sazzarran can split up their Kaiju and MUs to take more zones in an attempt to damage and potentially destroy the cities and land zones.<br/><br/>Once the Sazzarran has moved any or all of their units, the UERF counter moves their forces to a zone occupied by Sazzarran forces. Both sides may also attempt to blockade each other using the city, land and especially seas zones, to block movement from one zone to another.<br/><br/>5. Battle Phase: The players will battle for control of city, land, and sea zones. Each battle in a contested zone results in total elimination of an opposing force, unless they choose to withdraw after each battle round in that zone. All contested zones must be resolved with a battle. Once the last battle is fought, the game round ends. At the end of each battle in a zone, the players will receive Resource Points based on the build cost of the opposing unit destroyed. These Resource Points are tracked on the players Resource Trackers on their side of the game board.<br/><br/>At the end of game round five, the players will calculate their Victory Points (VPs. The Sazzarran receive one VP for each damage point on a city or land zone. The UERF receive one VP for each city or land zone that still have any Zone Points (ZPs) remaining. Both sides receive a VP for each zone occupied by at least one of their units. Both sides also receive VPs equal to the number of RPs they have remaining on their respective Resource Point Tracker. The side with the most Victory Points wins the game and will most likely have control of the Pacific Ocean and its coastal cities and land zones.<br/><br/>",

These fighters are little folk (which means that the scale of the models is actually 1:1) which exist in dimensions parallel to ours, and crash our world in order to thrive in theirs.<br/><br/>The basic game is very easy to grasp, and is a great option for a fast game that takes place in your actual living room coffee table, your office desk, or even around your kitchen sink. It takes no time at all to set up, so you can get your dice rolling in a breeze. If you are an experienced gamer, Home Raiders is a great choice for an improvised gaming session or even a well laid out match amongst a bunch of friends. If you want to play with your younger brothers and sisters, cousins or even your children, you won't find a better option to getting them started with this amazing hobby.<br/><br/>",

The Principal of the school with the most Prestige will be the next Archmage.<br/><br/>Each player controls 10 wizards of one of the 4 different schools (on the base game they would be fire, earth, water &amp; air). In the beginning players start with 4 wizards and add more to their ranks as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Each turn players will have to choose different locations on the board that suits their strategies from gathering resources, to recuiting wizards &amp; heroes, going into quests, creating potions and spells they can use later, and fighting in the terrible DARK TOWER.<br/><br/>Since this game is euro styled, all of this elements are somewhat abstract, so in order to go into a quest you place a wizard on one of the adventure cards and if you pay the resources needed and have all the requirements for the quest to be successful you win the card and any reward that is given.<br/><br/>Heroes are an important part of the wizard guild as they provide extra abilities to combat and enhance how the resources are gathered. They can go up levels (up to 4) and with each level they grant more to the school they work for. Up to 2 levels can be earn in the usual tavern brawls... but the other 2 must be gain in quests or challenging the DARK TOWER.<br/><br/>Archimago has several elements shared by traditional Eurostyle games that use worker placement but at the same time potions and spells provide and interaction with the other players that if mastered can be of a great assistance to the School, events change game conditions, Characters can appear and add a new location to go to, etc.<br/><br/>The base game comes also with 1 scenario that is made of a set of cards that are mixed with the adventure cards and that when are dealt change the conditions of the game or offer sudden opportunities for the players that have the resources to risk or the desire to count on fate for better possibilities.<br/><br/>The game is modular so it is highly expandable in several directions that will add to the system new possibilities and the feeling of adventure, starting with new scenarios that will make each game feel different, characters that will appear in the different locations to assist the players, events that will happen when creating potions and more sudden apparitions that will contribute greatly with the atmosphere of the world.<br/><br/>The game ends on 1 of 4 conditions:<br/><br/><br/>    The adventure cards spots cannot be filled.<br/>    2 or 3 lines of potions/spells are depleted.<br/>    Sometimes a Scenario Card will end the game when certain conditions are given.<br/>    When all the Dark Tower Cards are gone.<br/><br/><br/>In the end Archmage is more than an eurogame, an experience that is worth trying. Each adventure card has been carefully designed so the title leads to the story below. Beyond the abstract elements there is a story going on in the game that those players that are fan of the detail will certainly love.<br/><br/>Spanish description:<br/>El Archimago esta muriendo... un sucesor debe ser encontrado de entre las 4 escuelas de magia, asi que un concurso se realizara.

The goal of the game is to create the best possible romantic matches between them.<br/><br/>Each player has three male cards and three female cards. Each player takes a turn hosting an event (parties, afternoon teas, dinners) and players bring one, or more, pair of male and female characters to the party. During the events, incidents occur, described by the host. Each female character reacts to the event by trying to showcase one of the following virtues: beauty, wit, friendliness, propriety, accomplishments, loyalty, fortune, and independence.<br/><br/>When the event is over, the host chooses the best storyteller among the other players. This player gets an advantage in the next part of the round: the proposal. The players use one male character to propose to one lady present, making their choices according to the virtues listed on the cards.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has three matches. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

As in the original battle, however, the kinds of units (game pieces) that each player has is different.<br/><br/>Since Miracle does not use dice, it may resemble Chess or perhaps Stratego to you. But both those games are abstract, while this is a strategic simulation of an historical battle from the point of view of the two overall commanders: Admiral Yamamoto for the Imperial Japanese Navy, and U.S. Navy forces sent by Admiral Chester Nimitz. Plus the sides are exactly equal in both Chess and Stratego - here each player has assets and liabilities based on the historical situation. For example, the US has fewer aircraft carriers than the Japanese, but has the unsinkable (but unmovable) Midway Island airbase.<br/><br/>Like both those games previously mentioned - and unlike most wargames - we do not use dice or any other random generator. This means the game emphasizes each players skills in strategy and in tactics to attain his own goals, or at least deny the other player his.<br/><br/>Miracle takes place on a water- and smudge-resistant vinyl map small enough to fit in a notebook. We even supply a ziplock plastic bag for the pieces and a resealable plastic cover for the map, making this a very portable game. The rules are short - two pages - and they're online at all times in case you forget to bring a printed copy. An entire game can be played in 35-45 minutes or less. It's quite possible to play a game during lunch, finish it, and switch sides and play it again.<br/><br/>It's easy to learn the rules and quick to play, but the game plays subtly and mistakes are costly. Take care with your forces! As in the original battle, the slightest mistake can cost you the outcome!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cards of Cthulhu a deck building game is centered around the Lovecraft genre which Cthulhu is famously known by.<br/><br/>In the game you will compete to build a better deck than the other investigators, defeat Ancient Ones, all the while not going insane.<br/><br/>Cards of Cthulhu is a deckbuilding game where you and up to 4 other players each strive to build the best deck, called your library and score as many victory points in order to win the game. Each player starts the game with the same library, 7 Strengths and 3 Fears.  Players shuffle the library and deal themselves 5 cards.  Each Strength is worth 1 power.  Fears are worth nothing.  The opening hand can have from 2 to 5 points of power.  The main deck of cards is then dealt 5 cards out to the Storyboard.  If any events happen, do what the card says, otherwise, check for card's with surprise effects (which usually add to your insanity).  Now the first player takes their turn. They can use their hand of cards to buy items from the storyboard based on their cost (and, in the case of Horrors, the insanity level to banish them).  Non-horror cards are placed in that player's graveyard, Horror cards are banished to the banished stack.  At the end of the turn, the player draws their five cards again, if the library lacks sufficient cards, shuffle the graveyard back in to the library and complete the rest of the five card draw.  The play is passed on to the next player, who then refills the storyboard from the main deck of any cards that were purchased or banished by the prior player.  Resolves and event and surprise effects and then their turn starts.<br/><br/>Insanity rules - In the game, it is very important to track just how insane you are!  Everyone starts out totally normal - with zero insanity - event, surprise effects and using certain arcane or artifacts will increase or decrease your insanity.  If you reach 13 insanity, you have crossed over and succumbed to insanity.  At this point, the only way to reduce your insanity is playing cards that reduce your insanity or discarding cards to reduce your insanity by the Victory Point value of the card.  You'll need to do this as soon as possible because if your reach 20, you've completely lost your mind and are a vassal for the Ancient Ones (or, in game terms, you just lost and are out of the game).<br/><br/>Ancient Ones - Before the game is started, you separate the Ancient Ones, Azathoth, Hastur and Cthulhu are shuffled and put on the bottom of the stack.  Yig is taken out and the rest are shuffled and put on top of the stack.  Then Yig is placed face up on the stack.  While the Ancient Ones are face up on the stack, they have an effect, called The Haunting - which impacts the game.  Yig, for example, cost 8 points to defeat, however, his haunting effect is that, for each two banished Horrors, Yig costs 1 more point to defeat.  If three Horrors are banished, Yig would cost 9 points to defeat.  When a new ancient one is revealed from the stack, which happens after one has been defeated, they have a one time &quot;awakening&quot; attack - this is an effect that happens immediately when they are turned face up and the attack is against each player.  If the player has a defense, they can defend against the attack - if allowed. For example, Ithaqua's Awakening Attack is that each player puts all Allies from their graveyard back in to the story.<br/><br/>Psychic Blast - These cards are put in a stack outside of the main deck or the Ancient One's.  They cost three points and can be purchased at anytime during your turn.  Sometimes the storyboard will contain cards you don't want or can't buy and you can always buy a Psychic Blast if you would like.  When a Psychic Blast is destroyed, it is placed in the destroyed pile.  If the stack is empty, no more Psychic blasts can be purchased.<br/><br/>Corruption - These cards are put in a stack outside of the main deck or the Ancient One's. Card effects that say you gain a corruption are from this stack of cards.  Corruptions are have a -1 victory point, which, costs you points at the end of the game if they are in your library.  When a Corruption is destroyed, it is returned to the corruption stack.  If the corruption stack is empty, no more corruptions can be handed out to players.<br/><br/>Investigators - Each player represents an investigator, a Gangster, Law Enforcement, Nun, Priest, Private Investigator, Professor or Psychic.  Each investigator has a special ability that allows them to do their special thing during their turns.  The Psychic's ability allow that player - at the beginning of their turn, to look at the top two cards of their deck and then put one of those cards in the graveyard.  Most of the time, this will help the player select the best of the two cards, possibly discarding a card they would rather not draw, sometimes both cards would work very well, but they still have to discard one.   Other abilities affect the cards drawn, power of cards, the storyboard and so on.<br/><br/>",

But now Flint's old chart has turned up, on which the hiding places are marked. Multiple pirate ships simultaneously reach the island group in which the treasure chests are hidden. But the restless ghost of Flint is guarding the treasure. Who will be successful and recover the most valuable treasure chest?<br/><br/>The starting player plays with 8 large and 5 small markers, the other one with 8 small and 5 large markers. Players alternate taking turns placing their markers on different spaces, never identically repeating the opponent's move. The game ends when both players have placed all of their 13 markers on the 7 spaces of the island. The 7 spaces are scored one after another. At each space the player with more markers (or in case of equal numbers, more large markers) wins. In case of a tie, no one gets the treasure chests. The player with the most treasure chests wins.<br/><br/>Originally published in spielbox 1991 #4.<br/><br/>",

The honey can also be marketed or refined which can increases its value, or simply opt to generate a small amount of income.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The rules of Alician Draughts were first described in the book &quot;Les Jeux de dames non orthodoxes et autres jeux &agrave; pions&quot; in 1956.<br/><br/>The standard game of International Draughts is played using two boards, A and B. The normal array is on board A; board B starts empty.<br/><br/>In turn, each player makes a single move on either board following these three rules:<br/><br/>1. A move must be legal on the board where it is played.<br/>2. A piece can only move or capture if the corresponding destination square on the other board is vacant.<br/>3. After moving, the piece is transfered to the corresponding square on the other board.<br/><br/>The original board (not the &quot;mirror board&quot;) decides the game:<br/><br/>Whenever a player has no piece left on the original board, he loses even within a move. A move consists of up to three stages: Movement (which can be a jump in case of a capture), Transfer of the moved piece to the other board, Removal of any captured pieces. That is, if at any stage a player had no pieces left on the original board, he lost the game.<br/><br/>In practice, it is possible to play Alician Draughts on a single board, if the checkers have a piece of felt glued to their bottom. When a piece (men or king) is transferred to the &quot;mirror board&quot;, it is just turned upside down.<br/><br/>Despite many similarities Alician Draughts is in fact a very different game. While in International Draughts more than 50% of all tournament games today end in a draw, in Alician Draughts a draw is impossible.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Star is a two-player abstract strategy game designed by Ea Ea as the third out of four games by him extending or generalizing Hex. The four games in publication order: The Game of Y, Poly-Y, Star, and *Star. See further details of the developmental history at the designer's homepage.<br/><br/>The game board for Star is a hexagon with uneven side lengths made up of hexagonal spaces (e.g. alternating edge length of 6 and 7 hexes). On the board, the playing area is surrounded by a ring of &quot;partial edge hexagons&quot; used for final scoring. The two players (black and white) takes turns to place one stone (in their color) on any un-occupied hex space in the playing area. The goal of the game is to create &quot;stars&quot; - groups of connected stones belonging to one player that touches at least three partial edge hexagons. Each star has a score of the number of partial edge hexagons it touches minus two. The final score of a player is the sum of points for all the stars of that players color. The player with the highest score wins. The sum of the two players score is constant for any particular board.<br/><br/>From Wikipedia:<br/>Star is a two-player abstract strategy board game developed by Craige Schensted (now Ea Ea). It was first published in 1983 in Games magazine. It is a connection game, related to games such as Hex, Y, Havannah, and TwixT. Unlike these games, however, the result is based on a player having a higher final score rather than achieving a specific goal. He has since developed a slightly more complicated version called *Star with better balance between edge and center moves, writing &quot;*Star is what those other games wanted to be.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Unleash your Great Warrior and assemble your Warband to raid and plunder your opponent and grow your Orenda.<br/><br/>Attack and Defense Card System: This unique combat system gives you the ability to choose the attack or defense maneuver of your key characters providing a critical decision point in the game during each and every melee you may fight.<br/><br/>Medicine Roll Initiative System: This creative initiative system allows interesting aspects of the Native American Indian mythology to be added into the game play and provides the game with more of a feel for the Legendary Pre-Contact period.<br/><br/>Orenda: This word is the Iroquoian name for the spiritual power inherent in people, animals and the environment. The rich Iroquoian mythology introduces aspects that allow us to creatively add magic, spells and spirit creatures to the game. Of course the wargame purist does not have to add these rules to the game if your inclination is for standard combat.<br/><br/>",

The seven historical scenarios include the British, French, Germans, Americans and let&rsquo;s not forget, the Bulgarians!  The game&rsquo;s namesake is born from the German flamethrowers that are added, raising the corrugated lethality of the counter mix. Battle with Schneider, MKIV, and A7V tanks. Bombard enemy positions with mortars and artillery, rake the advancing infantry with machine guns, and infiltrate enemy lines with Stosstruppen.<br/><br/>Designed by John Gorkowski, In the Trenches enables players to game historically accurate simulations of tactical operations from the Great War. ITT challenges players to move and fight with company-level formations made of separate platoon-sized units during five minute, impulse-based turns. The historically accurate maps are scaled to 100 yards per hex. This approach recreates WWI command and control problems and inspires historically accurate play without forcing decisions.<br/><br/>",

Short instructions and intense gameplay make this one ideal for parties and energetic groups of friends looking for a few laughs. In the game, players must work together with a partner to get the crowd to guess the four items on the card before the time expires. Only one player sees the card. That player stays out of view to everyone except their partner and acts out the items on the card. The partner mimics every action to try to get the crowd to guess correctly. Points are awarded for correct guesses. Opposing teams get a chance to steal points on each round. Everyone is either acting or guessing on every turn, so there is never any down-time, sitting around twiddling your thumbs.<br/><br/>",

In this central open space of Shabono the children have to prove to the shaman who is the fastest collector among them. At the same time the shaman pours coins from a tree trunk with animal motifs, which the children must collect as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>At Shabono the players perceive the roles of the Indigenous children as well as the tasks of the shaman. <br/>The aim is to collect the animal motifs as quickly as possible and to reach as many points as possible, because the coins have different values.<br/><br/>But the shaman is also guardian of the time and determines by his skill how long the respective collection lasts. In addition, the shaman, with the hand of the &quot;coin of the quick hand&quot;, indicates with which hand to be collected.<br/><br/>The game Shabono is played in two rounds. In each round, each player is once a shaman.<br/><br/>In the first round the players must collect coins of an animal motif.<br/><br/>In the second round, the players must collect coins from two different animal motifs. It can happen that two players have to collect the same animal motif. The colored toucan must always be collected by each player.<br/><br/>In the game with the special coins, the players also have the opportunity to influence the game through various actions of the coins.<br/><br/>",

Dixon's voice come in strong and clear: &lsquo;Scratch one flattop! Dixon to carrier: Scratch one flattop.&rsquo;&rdquo; -- Stanley Johnston, war correspondent for The Chicago Tribune, on the sinking of the Shōhō<br/><br/>The Japanese Empire invincibly thundered across the Pacific Ocean in the months after their surprise attack at Pearl Harbor. Scrambling in defense, the Americans gained intelligence of impending Japanese invasions across the Coral Sea, and moved two fleet carriers to oppose. The war's first great carrier battles ensued; the Americans would deliver the initial blow on 7 May 1942 when aircraft from the carrier Yorktown sank the Japanese light carrier Shōhō.<br/><br/>Dixon to Carrier: Scratch One Flattop! from designer Esteban Fernandez is a co-op game where each player takes control of one or more Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers from the USS Yorktown carrier. The objective of the game is to find, and sink, the Japanese aircraft carrier IJN Shōhō. The Japanese Navy wins if the players lose a certain number of planes or if the USS Yorktown is sunk.<br/><br/>Now you can attempt to recreate those fateful days in May. The stern days of Japanese naval supremacy must be challenged; will you succeed, or end in a watery grave?<br/><br/>",

They promptly asked, &quot;Where is Victor&rsquo;'s office?&quot; After receiving information, they came to the door and entered without even knocking. After an hour, they quietly left the office and precinct. From this moment I knew that this is some serious business. At the meeting in the board room, everything became clear. These sad gentlemen gave Commissioner information about the warehouse, which is being used as a dead drop location for gang of smugglers. The warehouse is full of crates, so each detective has been tasked to check packets with different cargo. The time is running out &mdash; get out and catch the smugglers!<br/><br/>Commissioner Victor: Case of Elusive Smugglers is a logic game for 2-4 players who try to group crates with the same cargo, ultimately stopping the shipment of illicit goods. Players take turns in clockwise order. During their turn, a player chooses one of visible move tiles, then they resolve this tile so at least one of their crates move. Move tiles come in two types:<br/><br/><br/>     Direction tile: The player moves the entire row (left/right tiles) or column (up/down tiles) in the direction shown on the tile. The structures &quot;wrap around&quot;, so moving down places the crates on the bottom row at the top.<br/>     Rotation tiles: The player rotates four tiles in the direction shown on the tile.<br/><br/><br/>The player who groups their crates first wins.<br/><br/>",

The first edition was published in 2016 in Japanese but a new edition is being prepared for SPIEL '17, with English, German and French rules.

You compete to see who can hunt the most animals. You can play eight different scenarios depending on how you arrange the three cubes. Even though it is a simple game, it has a deep feel to it, which even children and older people can enjoy.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>日本の江戸時代から伝わる伝統的な遊び「投扇興（とうせんきょう）」は、台の上の的に向かって扇を投げ、的を倒して遊ぶ射的ゲームです。侍鳥はこの投扇興をよりシンプルなルールにし、誰でも簡単に遊べるようアレンジした新しい遊びです。箱と的を動物に、扇を動物を狩る鳥に見立てて、動物をどれだけ多く狩れるかを競います。3つの箱を組み合わせることで全8ステージが遊べます。シンプルですが奥が深く、子供からお年寄りまで楽しめるゲームです。<br/><br/>",

All special cards have a bottom part with showing colours on which they can be played, and an upper part which shows their effect on the next player's turn. The only exception is the wolf, which has a special effect. <br/>The Special cards are organized in three difficulties steps.

        "description": "MystiQuest tells of epic clashes between ancient gods, fought on the banks of the Styx, the infernal river. Gods, heroes, monsters and mythological creatures battle with all their power, fighting during the day and spending the night celebrating.<br/><br/>Is a trading card game, but very close to the Living Card Games, thanks to the use of Planks, tokens and the possibility to implement long-term strategies.<br/><br/>Each player has a board representing the fortress, on which he places the card of his Supreme Nume (or Prime) and the three heralds chosen to defend it. The heralds also represent Defence Points: if they are eliminated or used, the Prime is forced to take the field and expose himself in person. The winner first eliminates the Prime opponent.<br/><br/>It is interesting to note that the heralds can be chosen before starting the game and this allows you to plan very specific and different strategies according to the opponent you will have to face.<br/><br/>Mystic energy is represented by plastic gems. After playing a card you must take the gems from your well and place them on it. The gems on the card indicate the attack value, the defense value and the card&rsquo;s hit points. As a result, a card with three gems, deals three damage and can take three damage before it dies out, if it takes a damage it loses a gem and then inflicts only two damage from that moment.<br/><br/>During the confrontation phase the player on duty plays his own cards, sends them to the attack and uses his own prodigies to try to defeat the enemy ranks and force the Prime opponent to take the field.<br/><br/>At the end of the turn there is the breath phase. Temples, Prime and some other specific cards &quot;breathe&quot; and give mystical energy back to their well, so you can add new gems. Then it is up to the opponent to repeat the same sequence until one of the two Prime is defeated.<br/><br/>Another interesting feature is the possibility of playing in teams, even with &quot;asymmetric&quot; solutions: one against two, two against three, two against four, etc. thanks to the gaming system that automatically self-balances.<br/><br/>For the setting the mythological theme was chosen as an alternative to the now too widespread Fantasy. Currently it is possible to play with three Pantheon:<br/>- Ancient Greeks<br/>- Ancient Egyptians<br/>- Vikings<br/>The Japanese pantheon is already being prepared.<br/><br/><br/><br/>MystiQuest racconta di epici scontri fra antiche divinit&agrave;, combattuti sulle rive dello Stige, il fiume infernale. Dei, eroi, mostri e creature mitologiche si danno battaglia con tutta la loro potenza, combattendo di giorno e passando la notte a festeggiare.E&rsquo;  un gioco di carte collezionabili, ma molto vicino ai Living Card Games grazie all&rsquo;utilizzo di Plance, gettoni e la possibilit&agrave; di attuare strategie a lungo termine.<br/> Ogni giocatore ha una plancia che rappresenta la fortezza, su cui posiziona la carta del proprio Nume Supremo (o Prime) e i tre araldi scelti per difenderlo. Gli araldi rappresentano anche Punti Ferita del Prime, infatti se vengono eliminati o utilizzati, il Prime &egrave; costretto a scendere in campo ed esporsi in prima persona. Vince chi per primo elimina il Prime avversario.<br/><br/>E&rsquo; interessante notare che gli araldi possono essere scelti prima di iniziare la partita e questo ti permette di pianificare strategie molto precise e diverse a seconda dell&rsquo;avversario che dovrai affrontare.<br/><br/>L&rsquo;energia mistica &egrave; rappresentata da gemme di plastica. Dopo aver giocato una carta devi prelevare dal tuo pozzo le gemme indicate e posarle su di essa. Le gemme sulla carta indicano il valore di attacco, il valore di difesa e i punti ferita della carta. Di conseguenza una carta con tre gemme, infligge tre danni e  pu&ograve; subire tre danni prima di estinguersi, se subisce un danno perde una gemma e quindi da quel momento infligge solo due danni.<br/><br/>Durante la fase del confronto il giocatore di turno gioca le proprie carte, le manda all&rsquo;attacco e usa i propri prodigi per cercare di sconfiggere le schiere nemiche e costringere il Prime avversario a scendere in campo.<br/> Alla fine del turno c&rsquo;&egrave; la fase del respiro. I templi, i Prime e alcune altre carte specifiche &ldquo;respirano&rdquo; e ridanno energia mistica al proprio pozzo e quindi puoi aggiungere nuove gemme.  Poi tocca all&rsquo;avversario che ripete la stessa sequenza finch&eacute; uno dei due Prime non viene sconfitto.<br/><br/>Un'altra interessante caratteristica &egrave; la possibilit&agrave; di giocare in squadre, anche con soluzioni &ldquo;asimmetriche&rdquo;:  uno contro due, due contro tre, due contro 4, ecc. grazie al sistema di gioco che automaticamente si auto bilancia.<br/><br/>Per l&rsquo;ambientazione &egrave; stato scelto il tema mitologico in alternativa all&rsquo;ormai fin troppo diffuso Fantasy. Attualmente &egrave; possibile giocare con tre Pantheon : <br/>- Antichi Greci<br/>- Antichi Egizi<br/>- Vichinghi <br/>E&rsquo; gi&agrave; in preparazione il panteon giapponese.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Who cares for Russian Roulette? Those with true nerves of steel are willing to smash eggs on their heads, not knowing whether the eggs are raw, boiled, or rotten. In this game, you and your friends will be selecting and breaking eggs (or cards with eggs on, at least!) and whoever remains the cleanest will be the winner.<br/><br/>Each round, players are dealt a card with an egg on, and starting with the first player, they all declare what is on their card, though everyone has to say the same thing as the first player. The cards are then placed in the centre of the table, along with an unknown extra card. After a countdown, everyone grabs a card and finds out what sort of egg they have chosen, scoring from 0 to 2 points of &quot;mess&quot;.<br/><br/>The raw and rotten egg cards are kept by the players who took them, and the rest are reshuffled for the next round. When there are not enough cards for a new round, the game is over and whoever is the least messy is the winner.<br/><br/>Multiple sets of cards can be combined to allow more players to join in.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The only action taken by the player will be moving a card from one &quot;fan&quot; of many, to another one in descending order (e.g. 7 of clubs on top of 8 of clubs)<br/><br/>From the start all cards are visible in the tableau, but this doesn't mean the game can be won with strategy. More times than not, the game will not be beat because of unlucky draws. Such as kings being the top card of fans, or higher cards being on the bottom of the fan while the higher card of that suit is on top of the fan.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to win the race with your drone collecting as many Acceleration cards you can.<br/><br/>In this period the military technologies become common and spread among civil people. Children and adults from every class of the society begin to build their own fighting drones in order to run in clandestine and official races. To achieve victory they are ready to do everything legal and illegal: there was no chance for pity or alliances, but only for the dangerous gadgets that drones equip.<br/><br/>Speedrone: Fly or Die! it's a modular game: with a box you can play up to 5 players, with two boxes up to 10 and with 3 boxes up to 15 and so on. It's very simple and you do not need any extra components: the manual included in Speedrone - fly or die! - already contains everything you need to know.<br/><br/>The game-play is very simple: every player acts in a specific order that changes during the game, draws cards and plays every cards he/she wants. Acceleration cards drive you to the victory, other cards like Shellfire force you to lose positions; many cards protect drones from the deadly gadgets of the game and other cards called Event tell you in which situation you are in that round. There are a lot of cards and a high combination of strategies in Speedrone.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crown de Fleur is a tile removal solitaire puzzle game. House Fleur has taken control of the kingdom and as the royal florist you must pick all the flowers in the estuary to create a crown for the coronation ceremony.<br/><br/>The estuary is setup in a 4 x 5 tile grid with blue cubes around the outer tiles and green cubes on the interior tiles. The game is played by placing 1 tile to the estuary and matching flower edges to pick up any matching adjacent flower tiles. The matched tiles are added to you stockpile and the placed tile remains in the estuary. Play continues until there is only 1 single tile remaining at which you pay 1 cube to remove the final tile. Once the estuary is cleared then you have completed the puzzle.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hexdominup is a game that uses the Double-seven binary-coding hexdominoes set by Nestorgames.<br/><br/>Double-seven binary-coding hexdominoes includes 36 tiles (with numbers from 0 to 7) composed of two adjacent hexagons. Instead of the standard &lsquo;pips&rsquo;, this set uses a special concentric binary representation. A central pip equals 1, a small circle equals 2 and a big circle equals 4.<br/><br/>Hexdominup is a game for 2 to 4 players, derived from Dominup, by the same designer.<br/><br/>There are two types of placements in Hexdominup. In both cases the tile must be aligned with an imaginary hexagonal grid:<br/><br/><br/>     &lsquo;Climb&rsquo; placement: The tile is placed atop two adjacent tiles of the same level, so that the numbers (symbols) of the placed tile match the symbols underneath (one of each supporting tile).<br/>     &lsquo;Expand&rsquo; placement: The tile is placed on the table and adjacent to at least one tile already placed. The values of adjacent hexagons don&rsquo;t need to match.<br/><br/><br/>How to play<br/><br/>Randomly distribute the tiles face-down among the players (as in dominoes).<br/><br/>The player with the double-7 starts by placing it in the middle of the playing surface.<br/><br/>Starting with the second player, players take turns in anticlockwise order doing all of the following steps in order until the game end condition is reached:<br/><br/><br/>     If you can make a climb placement with at least one of your tiles, then you must do so. You can choose which tile to place, as long as the placement is legal. Repeat this action until you can&rsquo;t make any more climb placements.<br/>     If you have at least one tile left, then make one expand placement.<br/><br/><br/>If, at the end of your turn, you have no tiles left, then you&rsquo;ve won and the game ends. However, the other players can continue playing to determine 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place if they wish.<br/><br/>Variant: Misere Hexdominup. In this variant, the player who runs out of tiles first loses.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each one builds on previous discoveries, called prerequisites, and paves the way for new discoveries.<br/><br/>During a game, you will build together the &quot;Discovery Tree&quot; by each placing cards in turns. Discovery allows you, with a same deck of cards, to play several different types of games (from beginner level to expert). Depending on the type of game, the goal can be either to be the first to empty your hand (games with no points), or to collect the maxim number of points (you earn points each time you place a card).<br/><br/>In all games, each player starts with 5 cards. During your turn, you can place a card in the Discovery Tree if all its prerequisites have already been placed, or if it has no prerequisite (the starting cards). Once placed, a card benefits all players who can then use it as a prerequisite to place their own cards. The game ends as soon as the stack is empty and a player empties his hand.<br/><br/>Discovery is thus a semi-collaborative game which, like the evolutionary process, combines both collaboration and competition.<br/><br/>The Antiquity deck can be played as a stand alone game, or as an extension of the Prehistory deck (2019 edition).<br/><br/>Discovery is a game for adults and kids, from 6 years old, and ideal to play with the whole family. It can be played as a solitary game or with up to 9 players. Game plays range from intense and fast 15 minutes, to long strategic game (~60 minutes), depending on the type of game and the number of players.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

When they play a card, they can ask a question or look at someone's hand or do other actions to try and determine who is who at the table. After the characters are revealed, you play special cards to try and arrest the outlaw. But it won't be easy to arrest the Kid as he has special escape cards, pistols and a little TNT!<br/><br/>If Billy the Kid (or any Outlaw) is alive at the end of 7 rounds and has at least one Gold card, he wins the game. If the Kid eliminates the Lawmen, he wins the game. If the Lawmen eliminate the Kid (or all Outlaws), they win the game.<br/><br/><br/>    Get Billy the Kid! is the second in the 'Get!' series. Get Adler! Deduction Card Game was the first. <br/><br/><br/>",

Players take turns drawing delicious doughnuts and charming cupcakes from a row of cards, aiming to gather enough matching flavors to score big points. Bright colors help kindergartners begin matching as they learn to read, and simple scoring is built upon starting arithmetic.<br/><br/>Older players may use the advanced rules to build sets in a two-dimensional grid, allowing savvy collectors to spread a single card across two sets for high-scoring combinations. They may also use optional rules for secret information, forcing players to study each other in pursuit of high-value treats.

The game is not balanced although players may balance it as they deem fit. The actual fight was not; we had a healthy respect for the quantity, if not the quality, of the enemy.<br/><br/>The objective for the Soviet Player is to move 51%+ off the map's West Edge while the US player attempts to destroy the enemy advance guard and restore the screen line.<br/><br/>To play the game, you must have a copy of the initial GMT MBT Game. The expansion includes 9 11 x 17 maps scaled at 100 meters per hex (the same scale as the MBT game), a Scenario Briefing, a B Troop Battle Book and a Soviet Battle book with deployment instructions and order of battle listing, and a small errata sheet. The map is based on a period map of the battle area and utilizes contours to depict elevation.<br/><br/>The map will be mailed to customers and the files may be downloaded from this site.<br/><br/>Expansion sets are not required (BAOR, FRG, and the forthcoming Canadian supplement) provide additional vehicle counters as well as leaders. A list of substitute counters is provided to enable the player to field the complete order of battle for both sides or the players can use some of the expansion set vehicles or combine sets to complete the order of battle.<br/><br/>Mind the Gap can be played with two players but may be more interesting if played with up to 6 players on the US side (CO and the five platoon leaders), and 6 on the USSR side (Battalion Commander and 4 company commanders), and a referee.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In にゃんこパイレーツ (Nyanko Pirates), you are a bunch of adventurous pussycat pirates that go on a journey along the shores of multiple islands where danger and treasures await you. Will you dare fight for treasures by yourself, or will you take someone else with you? Two adventurers' worth of shields and swords might be of great help to succeed in beating the danger, but it also means sharing everything you find!<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>君は有名なにゃんこパイレーツになりたいにゃ！このため、準備をして、冒険へ出て、宝を集めて、にゃんこの世界で最も金持ちを目指すにゃ！ただ、色々な危険が待ってるにゃ。冒険へ出る前に、1人で行くか、他のパイレーツと協力して2人で行くか、よく考えないといけにゃい！さあ、賢く計画して、冒険へ出発だにゃ！<br/><br/>On your turn, you will roll the three original dice. These dice will give you different opportunities like gathering shields and swords, and you will need those if you want to face the dangers between you and the beautiful treasures these islands have to offer! The dice will also let you know the minimum number of dangers you will have to fight to reach the treasures. Each card from the Island deck of cards is either a danger, or an item that you won't be able to get in any other way. If you succeed in beating these dangers, you will get all the treasures! But beware, going by yourself might be very dangerous. Should you invite someone else to go along with you? If so, you have to keep in mind that you won't be able to keep all the treasures for yourself... yes, you will have to share with your lucky partner! Oh, and remember, failing while going through these adventures that await you also means that all your competitors will be able to steal the treasures you put to safety during your run!<br/><br/>",

As the day drew on, the King wandered deeper and deeper into the forest until suddenly he found himself lost and separated from his Guards. &quot;I'm lost! I'm lost!&quot; shouted the King. The King's Guards heard the King's cry for help, but they too were lost in the ever changing forest. They searched frantically for hours for the King, but to no avail. They were not the only ones in the forest that day searching for the King for unbeknownst to them...there were Assassins afoot!<br/><br/>King&rsquo;s Gambit is a hand held 18-card solo game. The goal of King&rsquo;s Gambit is simple: 1) defeat all four Assassins in the forest, OR 2) find the King (who is lost in the forest), and escort him safely through the forest back to the Castle. To do that, you must outwit the Assassins who are trying to kill the King. The Assassins can also wound you! The King&rsquo;s guards (who are also lost in the forest) can protect the King and you as well...if you can find them. The King also has Allies who can help you in your noble quest, but the King also has Enemies who will hinder your quest. Don&rsquo;t lose your way, or you too might get lost in the ever changing forest!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "骰是<br/><br/>'T&oacute;ush&igrave; - the Dicegrid puzzle game'<br/><br/>Overview<br/>The goal of the game is to fill in as many squares on the grid as possible, completed rows and columns will give bonus points when scoring.<br/><br/>During play, you roll dice to move around the grid and mark off squares. Every round but the first is much the same. You roll a die and use it to solve the grid puzzle and mark off two numbers from the lists of numbers, one for the type of die you use for the roll and one for the type of die you choose to mark on the board. If all numbers of a die type are used, you could no longer choose to roll this type of die or write that die type to the grid.<br/><br/>The die roll will be used both as the limit of movement and the number to cross off. You do not have to write the same die type on the grid as you roll, but the number used, must be within the range of the die type. Remember that there may not be two of the same die type written into any row or column.<br/><br/>There are three bonus actions to use during the game (the star symbols on the gameboard). Be aware that using them all will end the game, regardless of whether or not there are squares left to fill in. Resolve any movements before ending the game, after the last bonus action is used.<br/><br/>The first round will be different.<br/><br/>First round<br/>Chose a number from any list of numbers, mark this off and place your first mark on the board in any square on the grid. Write either a number, symbol or letters to remember what die type you chose. At the sides of the grid, there is die type symbols for all columns and rows, to help guide you, you could mark these off as well. This marked square is your starting position. The following rounds movements must start from the position of the previous round. You may not end a movement in a previously marked square.<br/><br/>Any following round<br/>Start the round by choosing one die of any type.<br/><br/>Mark off a number of own choice from the list of numbers the same die type as the die type you use.<br/><br/>Roll the die, and use this number shown to move, and to mark off a number from any list of numbers (associated with a die type), this is the die type you mark to the board. It has not to be the same as the die type you rolled.<br/><br/>Rolling a one<br/>If you roll the number one with any die, you either chose to reroll or use one bonus action. Unused bonus actions are worth four points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The Bonus action<br/>If you use a bonus action after a roll of one. Cross out one of your three bonus markers and mark one square anywhere on the grid with a die type of your own choice. This will be your starting position next round. Remember to cross out one number of that die type as well.<br/><br/>The bonus action could also be used as a reroll of any die roll during play. If you use the last bonus action for a reroll, resolve the roll and movements, mark a square and off number if possible before ending the game.<br/><br/>Movement<br/>You move by subtracting from your die roll. For each square you move, reduce the die roll with one. You could not go down to zero or below.<br/><br/>You may not move diagonally. You may move over and past marked squares as long as you do not end movement on a marked square.<br/><br/>You do not have to move in a straight line, you may do as many turns as you like, as long as you do not cross a square twice or move diagonally.<br/><br/>Marking a square<br/>The square you end your movement in is marked with letters (T+number) or the die type symbol of the chosen die, from which number list you also mark off a number. Remember that there may not be two of the same die type in any row or column.<br/><br/>Example<br/>If you roll a four and move two steps, you now have the number two to mark off from a die list of numbers (and remember to mark this die type in the square you ended up in). You may choose any die type as long as this number is within its number range and is available to mark off in the list of numbers of that die type.<br/><br/>Game ends<br/>The game ends when either one of these conditions is fulfilled.<br/><br/>The player had used the last (of three) bonus actions.<br/><br/>Is unable to move to an empty square (due to the result of the die roll and/or available numbers to cross out).<br/><br/>All squares are filled.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>Each filled square equals to one point. (up to 36 points)<br/><br/>Each filled column equals to three points. (up to 18 points)<br/><br/>Each filled row equals to three points. (up to 18 points)<br/><br/>Each saved (unused) bonus action equals to four points. (up to 12 points)<br/><br/>The Grid<br/>The dice icons next to the grid is for ease of gameplay, just to keep track of dice type per column and row<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Designed to be very small and portable, this is the perfect game when on the road.<br/><br/>Game play is very straightforward. Each player takes turns placing a piece on board in an attempt to have their 4 pieces in a straight line. If, after initial placement no one is winning, then each player takes turn moving their pieces along any lines. This creates quite a bit of strategy as each player must strike a balance between trying to get their 4 in a row, or stopping their opponent from doing so.<br/><br/>Quick and easy to setup and play, the game is suitable for anyone ages 7 or older. It is a pure strategy game like chess, meaning that there is no chance involved in the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 122 page ruleset seeks to provide a fast and fun game of fantasy mass combat. It is the designer&rsquo;s belief that the best games result from a combination of simple rules mechanics and the opportunity for the players to make many decisions.<br/><br/>In Pride of Lions the role of each player is that of the commanding general of the army or warlord of the horde. Magic, and the courage and skills of individual heroes, can affect the game, but the outcome of the battle will depend mainly on the clash of large units of common fighters operating under the general&rsquo;s orders.<br/><br/>Each turn begins with players issuing orders to eligible units by laying inverted movement chits behind each unit. After a magic phase, which can result in a unit&rsquo;s orders being changed involuntarily or randomly, all orders are revealed and movement is conducted simultaneously by all sides but in a strict sequence, with the most aggressive movement (charges) coming first and skirmishers going last. Both melee combat and missile fire are conducted through opposed die rolls, using dice of various sizes from D4s to D24&rsquo;s, with the difference between the die rolls determining the outcome. Factors such as terrain, magic, special weapons and tactics, and leadership and heroism by characters all affect the game either through the movement chits or the die rolls.<br/><br/>WHY A SECOND EDITION? HOW IS THIS ONE DIFFERENT? We have a LOT more experience of gaming with these rules now, and 2nd edition reflects lessons learned. There are numerous tweaks, as well as places where a longer explanation seemed necessary for clarity. There are lots of photos, partly to show off our miniatures but also as examples of play. And there are some substantial changes:<br/><br/><br/>     The point system is completely revised, with much greater detail, and applies now to characters as well as to units.<br/>     Dwarven rune magic is much more detailed.<br/>     Godfearers&rsquo; &ldquo;magic&rdquo; &ndash; prayer and spiritual gifts &ndash; is also far more detailed and extensive.<br/>     Spirits are developed further.<br/>     There are more and longer generic army lists and spell lists.<br/>     And the movement sequence of air units is better.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This exciting card game hit a really good sweet spot as a quick and light game that still had some interesting choices and lots of silly, over-the-top cinematic Kung Fu moments.<br/><br/>So after it was out of print we tried to Kickstart a totally new edition: fancy art, overhauled mechanics, higher production value, etc. Response was overwhelmingly meh.<br/><br/>Since that failed project, we've thought a lot about this game, and we still get occasional requests for reprints. After the success of our low-key print-on-demand version of En Garde Reforged, we decided we should do the same thing for Kung Fu Fighting.<br/><br/>We are very much using the KISS principle for this project: Keep It Simple, SlugFest!

        "description": "From the Expansion:<br/><br/>&quot;One of 3rd FLEET's limitations as a game is a shortage of scenarios. Other tactical/operational wargames overcome such a shortcoming by offering a system for designing your own(DYO) scenarios. But, for that one needs some manner in which to compare the units of the game. The following is an approximate valuation for each unit in 3rd FLEET based upon relative &quot;combat power&quot;, allowing players to customize their own fleets for additional scenarios.<br/><br/>These &quot;purchase points&quot; are given per-unit; the number in parentheses is the number of such counters provided in the game's countermix. If nuclear weapons are to be used, pay the<br/>cost to the right of the slash mark. Players may also purchase damaged units at half-cost. Each player may purchase mines for placement before the start of the match for five points each.<br/><br/>Before the game, the opposing players should agree upon the purchase level for each side, with each side getting the same number of points to work with. Roughly speaking, use 400-1000 points per side for a low-complexity scenario; 1000-3000 points for a scenario of medium length/complexity; and 4000+ points for an advanced scenario. A detailed breakdown of the point values of existing scenarios is provided for comparison purposes in the first sidebar.&quot;<br/><br/>It also provides for the following four new scenarios, complete with Special Rules, Game Length, Victory Conditions, and detailed Deployment:<br/><br/>Cuba Libre!<br/>Melee in the Caribbean<br/>Assault on Jamaica<br/>Red SeaLion<br/><br/>This expansion was first published as an article in The General, Vol. 27, No. 2 (1991).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The one feature that contributes most to 2nd FLEET's attractiveness as a game of strategy is its excellent playability. The sub-systems work very well together, and play flows smoothly even in the Advanced Game. The optional Logistics rules are the worst impediment to playability, but even these manifest themselves only at the end of every third turn; experienced, well-organized players can cope with these<br/>readily enough.<br/><br/>As with all &quot;modem&quot; wargames dealing with hypothetical conflict, 2nd FLEET shares the problem that it must amount to an &quot;educated guess&quot;. There is no history against which its accuracy can be closely measured (the recent Gulf War notwithstanding). This situation is especially acute for naval games, as there has yet to be a conflict encompassing all the elements embraced by the FLEET series. For example, although guided missiles, airpower, submarines and surface vessels all took part in the Falklands War, there was no simultaneous use of all four elements of naval power in a coordinated manner by both sides in any single engagement. If 2nd FLEET must be an educated guess, however, then it is a very educated one. Another expert might argue with Joe Balkoski's systemic forecast of modem naval warfare, but until the awful day that the real world provides a real standard to judge by, 2nd FLEET's accuracy stands to be as good as that of any other game on the subject.<br/><br/>There are some areas in which players can afford to experiment with the rules, however. One lies in force deployment. The Readiness Level selected for the Advanced Game scenarios and subsequent die rolls for reinforcement can accelerate or decelerate the arrival of units, but the general pattern of disposition remains the same. As warships and air units can move faster than the political events leading to a superpower conflict, this pattern should not be viewed as rigidly unalterable.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>The expansion provides variants focusing on deployment options for NATO and the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Super Nova Smash! is a fast-paced phone + card party game for 2-8 players about racing through the blast of a supernova. The goal is to get rid of your cards before your friends &mdash; and do as much damage as you can while you go.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 96 cards, numbered 0-5. You can play one card higher or lower than the card on top of a play pile, including your on your own pile, and those numbers wrap, so you can play a 5 on a 0 and vice versa. The &quot;0&quot; card is special, though, in that it counts as damage (negative points), counted at the end of the round, so it's best to try to play them on other people's piles while defensively keeping your pile as far from 0 as you can.<br/><br/>The app is there to tell you when to play, give you random challenges, and generally make your life a panic-inducing nightmare (in a fun way!). The app will randomly (but evenly) assign turn order and occasionally force all players to compete in quick, frantic mini-games on the device &mdash; often when they least expect it.<br/><br/>The first person to get rid of all their cards and tap the button in the middle of their screen gets the most Space Points, with fewer points being given to each player as they finish. Once all players are done, they are asked to count their damage (cards marked &quot;0&quot;), and then the app will calculate their scores for the round.<br/><br/>Rounds typically last about 3-6 minutes, and the player with the most Space Points at the end of 10 rounds wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The area control aspect is fairly traditional with two major twists: areas will merge as you play, and there are unique rules for hand management.<br/><br/>Every player starts the game with the same hand of nine cards, one for each district in Tome, but the cards are shuffled and can't be reordered after picking them up. Each round you pick two of the first three cards in your hand and use one to determine where you place cubes and the other to determine how many cubes you place. Cards that let you place two cubes correspond to more central and thus valuable districts, so you have to choose between good placement or more cubes.<br/><br/>After a district is filled with cubes accounting takes place, and typically after each accounting a &quot;friendship token&quot; will be placed between two districts, connecting them. After that filling individual districts still triggers accounting, but during accounting cubes in directly connected friendly districts are counted the same as cubes in the district itself. In the extreme case you could even take first place in a district you have no cubes in if you've packed a friendly neighbor.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The top of the variable game board shows five characters from the book series, the bottom shows five locations. In between there is a labyrinth consisting of four stripes with paths on them. <br/>One player rolls a dice, determining from which of the characters a rabbit escaped. All players follow the path of the rabbit and try to determine which location it is hiding in. Rabbits always turn when they have the chance, and if the stripe shows two rabbit holes, they change from one to the other. When a player thinks they know where the rabbit is, they grab the corresponding location tile first. If successful, they get to keep one of the stripes which is then replaced by another. Tiles that have been used are returned face down, so a memory aspect is added. When all stripes have been dealt out, the player with most stripes wins.<br/><br/>",

He decided that the next day he would send a large strike out to the west of the garrison&rsquo;s position, tasked to capture a nest of AA batteries near the villages of Bang Ong Pet, and Ban Ban. The man he chose for the job was the most respected leader in the French garrison: Major Marcel Bigeard, affectionately known by a nick-name earned during his days in the resistance: Bruno. Behind a powerful barrage and ample air support the French attack came in. The 6th BPC (Colonial Parachute Battalion) struck Bang Ong Pet while the 8th BPC struck Ban Ban. The 8th achieved its objectives quickly, but the 6th was pinned down by stiff resistance. Three Chaffee tanks came up to reinforce the latter French assault and Viet Minh resistance soon gave way. When it was over the French were astounded at their success. Not only had they captured five 20mm AA-guns, twelve 12.7 AA MGs, and killed some 350 of the enemy, but they had done it against the elite 308th division, viewed by both armies to be the best unit the Viet Minh possessed.<br/><br/>Game components include:<br/><br/>9 maps measuring 18.5&quot; x 12.5&quot;<br/>3 countersheets (1 x Viet Minh, 1 x French Infantry/Light Weapons, 1 x Vehicles)<br/>9 AFV cards<br/>4 scenario cards containing 7 scenarios<br/>4 page battlefield walkaround<br/>1 page player aid<br/><br/>The game depicts the action around the Eliane strongpoints of Dien Bien Phu.<br/><br/>Scenarios included:<br/><br/>The Battle for the &ldquo;Five Hills&rdquo; &ndash; Positions at &ldquo;Eliane 1,&rdquo; Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, March 31st 1954<br/>    In French Hands - Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, March 31st 1954<br/>    Death by Pale Moonlight &ndash; Positions at &ldquo;Champs Elysees,&rdquo; Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, March 30th 1954<br/>    In the Shadow of Bazilles - Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, May 6th 1954<br/>    The Last Day &ndash; Positions at &ldquo;Elaine 4,&rdquo; Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, May 7th 1954<br/>    Mop Up - Dien Bien Phu, French Indochina, April 2nd 1954<br/>    Under Old Baldy &ndash; Champs Elysees, French Indochina, April 4th 1954<br/><br/>Requires ownership of the ATS Rulebook 2014 + small and large markers.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This battle deals with the situation after the Battle of Eckmuhl and the French pursuit of the Austrians.  General Nansouty with 3 cavalry divisions takes on a significantly smaller Austrian cavalry rearguard attempting to keep the French away from the Austrian main body, giving them time to get away.  There is only cavalry and a handful of artillery batteries in this fight.  It is a wild set of charges and counter-charges, with some intermittent artillery fire, spaced into a couple hours.  So the battle is short and easily played in an afternoon.  Counter density is low and there is some room for maneuver.  Both sides have a chance to win this event.  The more time the Austrians give the main body to escape the better the chance of winning.<br/><br/>Key Features                                                                     <br/><br/>        (4) 11&quot; x 17&quot; game maps of the Alt-Eglofsheim area<br/>        Approximately 600 Die Cut Unit Counters and Markers<br/>        (2) Full Color Order of Battle Charts<br/>        Numerous charts and tables<br/>        (2) Scenarios that allow play on smaller parts of the battle or the entire affair<br/>        Variable combat strengths<br/>        Reduction by Levels of Order<br/>        Cavalry units at the squadron level and artillery at the section level<br/>        Regimental level cavalry units<br/>        Highly detailed without overbearing rules<br/>        Excellent Solitaire Play<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It contains the best winter and holiday illustrations from all previous sets, but there are also new, new cards - as many as 11 pieces,<br/>they can be mixed with any set except the Jubilee. If you add a few, you get a very different Imaginarium, It has all the components for an independent game. This is a simple association game that everyone likes - this is an excellent reason to save a couple of boxes for the winter holidays.<br/><br/>Rules of the game:<br/><br/>Each player chooses a chip and a set of voting cards in the same color as the chip.<br/><br/>Definition of the first move<br/><br/>You must determine who will walk first. You can use voting cards for this. All participants take their voting cards, shuffle and draw out any card at random. The first to start is the one who pulled out the card with the highest number. You can use any other mechanics to select the player starting first. For example, we play this right in chess. Then the game goes clockwise.<br/><br/>Game progress<br/><br/>All player chips are set to 1.<br/>The deck with illustration cards is shuffled and each player is given 6 cards in his hands.<br/><br/>The player makes an association.<br/><br/>Each turn one of the players becomes the leader. The presenter makes an association on one of his cards, tells the association out loud to the other players and puts the hidden card upside down on the table. Each player puts out one card, the most suitable for the voiced association. Then the cards are mixed and laid out in a row.<br/><br/>Guessing the leader&rsquo;s card.<br/><br/>The main task of the players is to guess which of the cards laid out on the table the presenter has guessed, and to vote for her. Each player selects one voting card with the desired number and puts it face down. The host does not vote or comment on the pictures posted on the table. You cannot vote for your own picture. When everyone made a decision and voted, the voting cards are turned over and points are scored.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>Players move their chips on the playing field by the number of steps corresponding to the number of points won.<br/><br/>",

So I made it!! I have been a big fan of Dungeon Core fiction for ages and thought that being able to physically build your own adventurer trap would be cool.<br/><br/>Little Living Dungeon is a mint tin game so it is small and portable, you start with your core room, and a small amount of Mana to grow your dungeon by adding extra rooms, at the end each day a adventurer will enter your dungeon to try and get to the core, and you will hopefully fight them off, as you grow your dungeon the adventurers get stronger and more of them.

Characters can range from barbarian warriors to animated skeletons to elven archers to unicorns &mdash; even two different dragons.  Booklets are traded and, as each player selects a move, a reference grid in the books determine the results (wounds, off-balance maneuvers, and so on).  Combat continues until one fighter or the other expires.<br/><br/>An interesting feature of the Lost Worlds system is that, under some versions of the rules, characters may improve their abilities as they gain experience.  In theory, you are supposed to keep track of your progress with each character, and if one is utterly killed, it will have to start over without its improved skills.<br/><br/>Part of the Lost Worlds series of books.<br/><br/>",

She plans to liberate Gaia, and has summoned you, her High Council of Sorcerers to manifest her will.<br/><br/>Work together to consult the heavens and read runes. Mobilize Titania&rsquo;s loyal Fae and port them to Gaia, where they will recover her crown from the six hallowed citadels. Will you divine the path to victory? Gather your golems! Summon your sirens! The Earth trembles before... Titania Ascending.<br/><br/>GAME OVERVIEW:<br/>Titania Ascending is a cooperative &ldquo;flip and write&rdquo; (and write) game for two to six players in which you and your friends become Titania&rsquo;s trusted High Council, coordinating the liberation of Gaia. In phase 1, you will populate your map with the units you want to send to Gaia; in phase 2, you will use your completed map to support the invasion.<br/><br/>FILL IN YOUR MAP:<br/>In phase 1, Divination, you arrange Fae and Dragons, recruit aides (special assistants), and select the hallowed units who will seize the 6 hallowed citadels and secure the Shards of Gaia for Titania&rsquo;s crown. Take turns choosing which unit everyone will draw on their maps (map/player board), coordinating with other players to divine hallowed units, and recruit aides to earn rule-bending abilities. The phase succeeds when all six hallowed units have been divined. You fail if everyone passes before you complete this goal.<br/><br/>USE YOUR MAP:<br/>In phase 2, Ascension, you open portals to Gaia (Earth) and send Titania&rsquo;s units into the field, using your hallowed units to seize the hallowed citadels. Take turns selecting missions to launch and shading in areas on your map that meet the mission requirements; meanwhile, the other players fill in similar areas on their maps. After you launch each mission, you can also send your hallowed units to capture the hallowed citadels. If you capture all six citadels, you restore Titania&rsquo;s crown, she ascends the throne of Gaia, and you win.<br/><br/>WINNING AND LOSING: <br/>You win together by divining six hallowed units during the Divination phase, then by capturing the six hallowed citadels in the Ascension, thus taking control of Gaia and saving the humans from themselves.<br/><br/>The whole team loses together in two ways:<br/>In phase one, Divination, you lose if all players pass before the six hallowed units have been divined.<br/>In phase two, Ascension, you lose if all players pass before claiming all six Shards of Gaia.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Use the unique skill of your pup to overcome obstacles and catch prized quarries in the underground world of Dirt Dog. Create challenges for your opponent to find out whose dog has the most moxie in the end!<br/><br/>Loosely based on the real world dog sport of Earth Dog, the game Dirt Dog has players leading their dog through underground burrows to try and track down quarry.  Badgers, foxes, rabbits, and others are all things for your dog to chase.<br/><br/>Play begins with players drafting obedience cards, which are used to help their dogs overcome obstacles within the burrows.  One player then constructs a burrow for the other player to run.  While running the burrow, both players may use obedience cards to make the challenges easier or more difficult for the dogs.  Failing to meet a challenge saps some of the dogs moxie, which is needed to make it through the burrow and defeat the quarry at the end.  The dog with the most moxie at the end of the round wins that round.  Best of 3 rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>Dirt Dog is playable as either a head vs head game or team vs team.  Team games have 2 players per team, called a brace.  Players in a brace help each other successfully run through burrows to try and make sure they make it to the end with more moxie than their opponents.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionImplo is a finite territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. The recommended board sizes are between 6x6 and 10x10. Each player must have access to a sufficient number of stones and markers of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.<br/><br/>A group is a piece along with all other pieces one could reach from it through a series of steps between identical adjacent pieces. Thus, all pieces in a group are the same type (stone or marker) and color (black or white).<br/><br/>The size of a group is the number of pieces in it.<br/><br/>Likewise, a territory is an empty point along with all other points one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent empty points.<br/><br/>A patch is a territory including at most four points.<br/><br/>The owner of a patch is the player with the biggest group of stones adjacent to it. If there is no such group or the biggest such groups of both colors are the same size, the owner of the patch is the opponent of the player who placed the last stone on the board.<br/><br/>To resolve a patch is to place a marker of its owner's color on each of its points and to remove the biggest group of stones which is adjacent to the patch and owned by the same player as the patch. If several such groups are tied for biggest, the player who is resolving the patch removes, among those, one of their choosing. If there are no groups of stones adjacent to the patch, no group is removed. Note the player resolving the patch need not be the owner of the patch.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform these actions in order:<br/><br/>1. Place a stone of your color on an empty point of the board.<br/><br/>2. Resolve any single patch on the board.<br/><br/>3. Repeat the previous step until no patches remain. Note the order of resolving matters, and resolving a patch may create new patches.<br/><br/>If, at the end of a player's turn, there are no empty points on the board, the game ends. The winner is the player with more groups of markers of the largest size of which there is an unequal number of black and white groups of markers. If there is a tie, whoever has more stones on the board wins. If this is also tied (only possible on even-sized boards), whoever made the last move loses.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>",

Not only are draws impossible in Nebuchadnezzar, almost any game of Nebuchadnezzar played to its conclusion will end with a board completely filled with a single color of disc.<br/><br/>Materials: A square board of any size (nothing bigger than 15x15 is recommended due to the amount of recycling and potential number of moves along with the amount of mechanical flipping involved) and an unlimited supply of discs with each player's color on either side. Go stones can also be used if you're willing to replace them instead of flip discs. (note: If you have an Othello set, 8x8 is a fine size to get started with)<br/><br/>Objective: wipe your opponent completely off the board!<br/><br/>Gameplay: Starting with black, on his turn a player may place a disc with his color facing up as long as it isn't orthogonally adjacent to exactly 1 enemy disc and 3 empty points. He may alternatively capture enemy discs according to the following convention. He cannot place and capture on the same turn.<br/><br/>A player may flip a rectangle of discs consisting purely of enemy discs, if the following qualifications are met<br/><br/><br/>     The rectangle is entirely bounded by single-colored walls (of discs) on all 4 of its sides<br/>     The player owns the majority of the perimeter created by these walls <br/>     The rectangle is not part of a bigger rectangle meeting these criteria.<br/><br/><br/>Edge rule: If one or more of the walls bounding a rectangle are board edges these will take on the color of the parallel walls opposite to them. If a rectangle is bounded by two opposite board edges then these are considered to be neutral walls.<br/><br/>Forced passing: You automatically pass your turn if no legal move is available for you on your turn. Otherwise passing is not permitted<br/><br/>Pie: After the first move, the second player may choose to switch colors instead of playing a disc of his color for his first move.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Events told in the books and the game happen in Year Of Our Lord 1420 in Silesia and Bohemia, torn apart by conflicts of political, religious and utterly private nature. In HTAG you can recruit a company of heroes known from the novel and pursue dangerous quests. Adventure Mode allows you to recreate events told in the novel (or even to change their course) - follow the footsteps of Reynevan and his friends! Competitive Mode will give you an opportunity to demand a trial by combat and challenge other players in several missions, i.e.: rescuing a prisoner, treasure hunt or drinking contest at a local fair.<br/><br/>Gameplay in HTAG is based on a character activation system and d6 rolls, which are supplemented by decks of Adventure Cards. Both players alternate in activating their respective characters, performing actions in order to acquire objectives. Opposing teams meet in combat based on an intuitive system in which characters' Attributes are tested through d6 rolls. Players can also strengthen their attacks or weaken the enemy with Adventure Cards played from their hands. Soon a cautious player will discover a potential of combining characters' Abilities with their faction's Adventure Decks. This knowledge will be your power over friends and foes.<br/><br/>",

The guesser turns around, and the SMAKtalking begins!<br/>The Guesser chooses the most and least helpful drawings and then reveals his guess. If the guess is correct then the guesser scores along with the chosen drawer(s). If incorrect the chosen drawer(s) have a chance to give a one word hint to help the guesser. If correct, then those players and the Guesser score 1 point each. The player or players that drew a picture that helped the least can defend and explain how their drawing resembles the wordcard. The guesser and all other players become the Jury. The Jury votes and 1 point is awarded to each drawing or drawings that received 50% or more in favor. The players that had no chance for a point in this round can elect to earn a Bonus point and compete in the challenge that is rolled with the special dice.<br/><br/>The Goal of the game is for every player to be involved at all times and for everyone to interact and share laughs.<br/><br/>This game was designed to include mechanics that High 5 has used in interactive team building events since 2001.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Put on the best show by chaining together tricks and you&rsquo;ll win the judges over.<br/><br/>Stunt Kites is a 2 player worker placement micro game.  Use your hands to push and pull your kite into position to perform tricks and earn points.  The player that earns the most points by the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds and on their turn a player places one of their two Hand cards on a central Pilot card.  These Hand cards act as workers and can block out actions from the other player.  The placement of the worker allows movement and rotation of a player's Kite card on a grid.  If the kite is in the required position and orientation on their grid, they can perform a trick earning them points.  Players can plan to do more tricks but must be careful to not get caught with unperformed tricks at the end of the game as those result in penalties.<br/><br/>When there are no Trick cards left in the Trick deck, the Final Trick is revealed.  When either player lands that trick, they claim it and the game ends immediately.

Some squares will definitely be safe based on the pentominoes in the challenge, whereas other squares will be safe only depending on how the organizer decides to place the blocks.

Whose frogs can catch the most of them?<br/><br/>Over the course of eight rounds, the players try to complete tasks to collect chips. There are speed rounds, in which you need to be quicker than the other players, and normal rounds, in which all frogs may perform one jump. If the goal of a round is met, players gain frog chips &ndash; with the fastest players gaining a ladybug chip on top. They show mosquitoes in different colors. After the last round, a scoring tile determines which mosquito color scores points. Whoever has the most mosquitoes of that color, wins.<br/><br/>Happy Hopping cleverly integrates the game box into the game and jumping aids makes it easier for younger players to perform good jumps.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In this phase, the octopus is moved depending on the number of octopus symbols on the revealed fish cards. As soon as the octopus lands on a field with a diver, it tries to steal a fish from the diver.

        "description": "A long forgotten power has reemerged, a conduit of great magic and ruin. Though dangerous and hot to the touch, you cannot resist the chance to control it. Willing wizards, are you ready to duel your friends to emerge victorious and unlock the secrets hidden within...the Spell Spud???<br/><br/>Spell Spud is a 2-6 player elimination game in which players pass around the hot potato while trying to avoid burning their hands. Cast spells, trap your foes, and be the last wizard standing to gain victory in this easy to learn, but surprisingly deep, card game!<br/><br/>Each player chooses a unique pair of hands to represent themselves. When it&rsquo;s your turn, you get to choose which hand you hold the potato with. If a Hand is burned, it&rsquo;s flipped to the &lsquo;Burned&rsquo; side. If it&rsquo;s burned again, it&rsquo;s out. With two hands, players have a chance to come back if they&rsquo;ve had a rough start.<br/><br/>The potato is the core of the game. Each player starts their turn with it in their possession, allowing them access to their actions while also placing them at risk of being burned.<br/><br/>Players can take two actions during their turn. You may use an action to draw from the Spell Deck, which holds several useful spells to defend yourself from harm or place your foes into dangerous situations. But, it also costs an action to cast most spells, so think ahead to utilize your actions most effectively.<br/><br/>",

The Byzantine Empire met its end in 1453, when the Ottoman Turks stormed its ancient capital, Constantinople, and the last emperor died fighting somewhere amidst the carnage. A few outposts would fall over the coming decades, and the Empire would never rise again.<br/><br/>In Byzantium Eternal, we add the Byzantines to our Soldier Emperor game, a Byzantine Empire that never fell. The Empire faced long odds in 1453, but it had miraculously survived even worse odds before. While it&rsquo;s indeed improbably that the Empire could have survived another 350 years, it was just as improbable for it to have muddled through the previous 350.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The time: late evening<br/>The date: 17 February 1864<br/>The Place: Breach Inlet, South Carolina<br/><br/>Standing in the submarine&rsquo;s forward hatch, Lieutenant George E. Dixon pulled his cap down and tightened up his oilskin watch coat. The February sea cut through to his bones. This was the third night he ventured from behind Battery Marshall on Sullivan&rsquo;s Island, and his seven-man crew was grumpy from having had no luck spotting, let alone attacking even one of the Yankee warships blockading Charleston harbor.<br/><br/>Dixon fingered the dented $20 gold piece in his trouser pocket. It was a gift from Queenie, his sweetheart, a keepsake that already earned its place aboard ship. A few months earlier at a wooded tangle of a place called Shiloh, the coin stopped a minie ball from shattering his leg. The dent reminded him how fickle fate and fortune are in this war, and it reminded him of home. He had that coin engraved &ldquo;Shiloh April 6th, 1862. My life Preserver&rdquo; and added his initials &ldquo;G.E.D.&rdquo;, so sure was he of the coin&rsquo;s power.<br/>Well, tonight that power was napping. Frustrated and cold, Dixon took one last look to the southeast through his telescope. The weather wasn&rsquo;t likely to improve and he hoped that this would be the night he and the crew of the &ldquo;CSS Hunley&rdquo; would strike a blow against the Yankee blockade.<br/><br/>Here now&hellip; was that a light?<br/>There!<br/>And once again, low and to the south-southeast. A light!<br/><br/>He rapped the coin against the hull to startle the men. &ldquo;Look sharp,&rdquo; he muttered. Then, in a voice low and tense, he said &ldquo;Look sharp and prepare to crank!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Game Overview<br/><br/>Infernal Machine: Dawn of Submarine Warfare is a solitaire board game that casts the player in the role of inventor/entrepreneur in mid-19th century America. The game is set during a historical moment when the business environment has gotten rather dynamic &ndash; it is the tumultuous landscape of the American Civil War. The player&rsquo;s task is to design, build, and put to use a submarine during that war.<br/><br/>Infernal Machine can be played either in scenario form or campaign. In a campaign, you can choose the city or port where the project&rsquo;s machine shop will be located. Since construction materials and labor costs money, your role as entrepreneur comes into play as you seek out Investors to join your team; their cash will provide the funds that help your Fishboat take shape. As Inventor, your design gives form and substance to the size and shape of your submarine, and to its capabilities. Will it carry a snorkel? Will its prow be an armored ram? Will it have dive planes? Will it push a spar torpedo? Will it be powered by the muscle strength of a crew cranking the propeller or will you install a boiler engine?<br/><br/>To bring blueprints to life, you will need to hire Mechanics, whose engineering expertise keeps the machine&rsquo;s construction on schedule. Once assembly is complete, your Mechanics can join the crew, using their repair capability to keep the machinery and the vessel running smoothly. Journeymen can also lend a hand on the shop floor and inside the Fishboat, while Sailors bring nautical know-how as well as sheer brawn.<br/><br/>While that machine shop is busy with the submarine&rsquo;s construction, the game reminds you that the war drags on and it is an unstable business environment. Prices for materials and labor fluctuate. Current events can affect your construction schedule and your machine shop&rsquo;s performance. Public, and even personal circumstances may force your hand. You may decide to push your Fishboat into the water before you feel it is optimal, or push your crew into battle with little training.<br/><br/>In this game you assign crew, taking their characteristics into consideration, such as morale, strength, engineering expertise. Your first mission will most likely be a simple affair, propelling the infernal machine forward, submerging, turning about, and returning to the surface. It will garner valuable experience that improves your crew&rsquo;s Training Level. But even that simple affair could prove treacherous. Will the Fishboat drift? Will it sink and become irretrievable? Will your crew panic in the dark as they breathe in the exhalation of their comrades in that cramped machine? Will you be forced to evacuate the crew and salvage the Fishboat later? Will the crew survive the ordeal?<br/><br/>Later missions will be directed at the enemy. In this game, you may play either side, Union or Confederate. There are a variety of missions and targets. Will your Fishboat be aimed at the Federal blockade? Will it pull a mine at the end of a rope, or push a torpedo at the end of a spar? Will the crew survive contact with the enemy? Will they survive their own weapon&rsquo;s detonation? Perhaps the nature of the mission will be quite different. Will you carry a spy into enemy territory? Will your Fishboat unload a raiding party?<br/><br/>Secrecy is vital. Will you send your machine out under a moonless sky? That will help conceal crew and machine but it will make navigation difficult. Will you limit the number of machinists and investors, thereby reducing the chance of rumor or gossip leaking out? Too few and you compromise your machine&rsquo;s capabilities. Your Fishboat&rsquo;s chances are much better if that machine is kept a secret, but it is a cantankerous machine that will punish mistakes.<br/><br/>A successful mission means your coffers will be filled with prize money. This is a capitalist&rsquo;s war, and the War Department is offering juicy bounties. In contrast, there are many ways to fail. Coming back without making contact with the enemy is one way, but it could be far worse. Will you add the names of your crew to the Rolls of the Missing?<br/><br/>Scenarios and Campaign<br/><br/>Historical scenarios use only part of the rules to present such events as the CSS Hunley&rsquo;s successful attack outside Charleston Harbor in 1864. It was the first time a submarine sank its target, a landmark event in military history. The heart of the game is the campaign, which allows you to design and build your Infernal Machine, select a crew, train that crew, and perform missions against the enemy. You manage funds and personnel, and navigate the fortunes of war as well as the waterways in enemy territory. A scenario will take approximately two hours to play while a campaign can last several gaming sessions as it spans the calendar from 1861 to the end of the war in 1865.<br/><br/>Sequence of Play<br/><br/>Each monthly turn gives you an opportunity to recruit personnel (Investors, Mechanics, Journeymen, or Sailors), each represented by a deck of cards. Each recruit comes with one or more benefits as well as costs or drawbacks. An Investor, for example, may be a generous provider of funds, but he may insist on being the captain of the ship. Does he know what he&rsquo;s doing?! A Sailor may prove to be strong and cool under pressure, but he may be clumsy. Will that clumsiness jeopardize his crewmates?<br/><br/>Each turn also provides you an opportunity to work on your Fishboat. You purchase Bulkheads and other major sections of the submarine, each represented by tiles. They cost funds and require engineering expertise to incorporate into a seaworthy vessel. You also purchase a variety of mechanisms as you make decisions about the capability of your Fishboat.<br/><br/>Recruitment and Building is followed by the passage of time when the Month marker is moved forward on the calendar. Debts must be paid, if you have any, and you must check the Fortunes of War table to see if something unexpected happens that month. Will prices rise? Will one of your Journeymen get engaged and leave your shop? Will the enemy shell the wharf where your Fishboat is waiting to go into action? Will you get an offer to use your machine shop to make parts for the War Department, giving you a contract and additional funds? Will the enemy capture the town, forcing you to move to another location? Each month has its own table of random events, and there is one set used when playing Union and another when playing Confederate. This adds to the feel of the historical experience while also increasing replayability. The Confederate experience is quite different from playing the Union. The latter is an industrial business environment while the Confederacy&rsquo;s economy gradually spirals into oblivion.<br/><br/>Each month you have the option to finish the turn by taking your seaworthy Fishboat into action. There are four Action Boards in the box, each providing its own unique historical and nautical conditions (Charleston, Mobile, New Orleans, and the James River from City Point to Richmond).<br/><br/>You setup a mission by establishing meteorological conditions on the Action Board (drift direction, drift intensity, visibility, and weather), and assign each crewman a position inside your Fishboat. Will you call off the mission because the current is too strong? Will you wait for a better opportunity, or will you push ahead despite the risk?<br/><br/>Your submarine will move from one space to the next as it executes its mission. During a mission you assign jobs to each crewman (crank, repair, rally, or operating a mechanism). This is new technology and the submarine is an untried machine, so malfunctions are likely and you will assign crew to manage and hopefully repair them. In many cases, just getting out there and locating a target is a victory of sorts, and getting the crew back home can feel like a triumph. Of course, your mandate is to do more than make contact with the enemy and survive. To gain prize money, you will have to prove your machine&rsquo;s efficacy against the enemy. It&rsquo;s an old story: higher the risk, greater the reward.<br/><br/>If you manage to navigate your machine and crew to make contact with its target, action shifts to the Tactical Board. There, the Fishboat closes in and you hope conditions are right so that it remains concealed. Decisions you made leading up to this tense moment have put your crew in a good position, or maybe in a bad one. In either case, history is watching.<br/><br/>Game Components<br/>4 Actions Boards (12&rdquo; x 18&rdquo;),<br/>1 Mechanics Board (8&rdquo; x 18&rdquo;),<br/>1 Tactical Board (8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo;),<br/>3 Countersheets (including boat tiles),<br/>3 Card Decks (Recruits, Navigation, Discovery),<br/>2 d10 dice<br/>Booklets and Player Aids<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Equipped with omnipotent magic powers and armies of underlings, each player slips into the role of a deity in the struggle for supremacy. With only their goal in mind, they endanger their own creation and set the world ablaze.<br/><br/>Into an empty universe, players create a three-dimensional game world. The players acquire resources in order to conquer the territory of the other players with their forces. At the same time, their god can cast more powerful spells turn by turn and thus decisively influence the game.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to defeat all of the opponents' units so that their god cannot return to the world. One's own tactics and the behavior of the opponents always give the game captivating twists and make the events unpredictable.<br/><br/>The turn-based building system gives new players the opportunity to gradually familiarize themselves with it during their first game. But Creators Of The First Dawn also offers new challenges to experienced players. The basic rules can be supplemented with modifications to freely shape the level of complexity of the game and shift the tactical focus according to one's own wishes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Drop an explorer on a river crossing, and it washes downstream to the previous river crossing. Drop an explorer on an animal token, and the owner of that explorer receives a special ability.<br/><br/>When a caravan reaches the source of the river, the game ends and the player who has made the most money along the way wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Anthromancer is a tabletop game system that features a suite of original neoclassical strategy and chance games, as well as an original oracle. It is primarily organized around a 2-4 player abstract strategy game called 'Mercenarium'.<br/><br/>In Mercenarium, players take turns placing and moving cards with various edge values in an attempt to overcome the edge values of opposing cards and capture them. The first player to capture 5 cards wins. Captures can be spent to gain control of enemy cards which pivot to the orientation of the buyer, changing the relative strengths on the battlefield and subverting enemy plans. In addition, each player is dealt 1 of 15 unique 'hymn' cards, which grant powerful abilities that dramatically alter the board state.<br/><br/>The game feels a bit like chess, but with far less predictability, due to the randomness of the deck and the asymmetrical powers of the hymns. Skill is gained by learning to predict patterns of movement, and being willing to take risks.<br/><br/>",

That item can only be picked up by another hero. The Santa Gor can only place one item per building space.<br/><br/>",

You are the staff of this shop. Cats are relaxing around. When the time goes by slowly, one of the staff whispered, &quot;Who is most liked by them?&quot;<br/><br/>You do everything to the cats. Of course, to be the most favorite of the cats in this shop.<br/><br/>--from the publisher<br/><br/>Each round, the staff of this cat caf&eacute; must try and guess what the cat is going to want from them. You'll know which of the four cat decks is going to be drawn from next, and if you've been paying attention, you should have an idea of the cards left in that deck. You'll play one of your four prediction cards, and either gain or lose the cat's favorability.<br/><br/>But be careful which prediction card you play, because you only have one of each! You can play your 'Leave Me Alone' card to avoid losing favorability, and to return all your cards back to your hand.<br/><br/>You also have a 'Full Power' card you can use when you're really confident in your prediction. If you guessed right, you can get a favorability bonus - either +5, +15, x3, or even x4 - depending on where you are on the scoring track. But the 'Full Power' card has to rest for a while before it can be used again, so choose wisely!<br/><br/>The staff member who the cats like best wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The industrial revolution marked a turning point in American history. The transition from handmade items to large-scale factories with industrial machinery made it possible to produce products at an epic scale. It also turned a handful of already industrious men into even more; it turned them into American moguls. Will you be one of them?<br/><br/>In American Mogul, players are captains of industry throughout the length of the industrial revolution in the United States, with each attempting to corner markets in the emerging states. Done through a brutally tight action-selection mechanism in which no action can be chosen twice in a round, the game is palpably tense as players struggle to get the right contracts, the best companies, and the edge in every market.<br/><br/>American Mogul is a follow up to 2013's Global Mogul, using the same core systems and adding more to it. Players now have captain cards that give each player a unique starting position and a special ability. Event cards make every play unique and interesting, but rather than random events, each player chooses an event during initial set-up. Players also choose a unique endgame scoring condition for each game, adding even more to the variability. Finally, a new action allows players to donate money to their own private foundations, then watch that money grow as the public matches donations and the interest accrues from round to round. The more players grow their foundations, the more special abilities they unlock. In a game that's brutally tight on money, how much will you give away? Will you be a philanthropist or a robber baron?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Albuera 1811: Beresford vs. Soult depicts the fiercest battle of the Peninsula War. Both engaged armies suffered terrible losses. Players can check if success could be achieved with lower cost.<br/><br/>Rules concentrate on infantry maneuvers on Napoleonic battlefield. It is important to form battalion into proper array in the right time. Intuitively Line gives advantages during musketry fire and Column is powerful in hand-to-hand fighting. Important is also placing an infantry battalion regarding to neighboring units. Flank-to-flank deployment gives farther bonuses in ranged combat and forms solid order of the whole army. An infantry battalion can detach a company of skirmishers. It is useful for screening  battalion's main body and harass enemy units with volleys. The best form of defense against cavalry is Square. In the box are rectangle counters. They represent line with broad front. This simply solution shows British 2-row line historical advantage over French 3-row - rectangle counters occurs more often in allied army.<br/><br/>Cavalry aspect is not so detailed, so cavalry is simply deployed in line formation.<br/><br/>Artillery can move or fire. Of course horse artillery can do both actions during one activation. The biggest advantage is a range of fire.<br/><br/>Command and control is simple. Players have certain Activation Chits and select some of them. Activation Chits of both players are placed in one Activation Pool. Blindly drawn Chit indicates formation which can move and initiate close combat. Melee is very bloody &ndash; both sides suffer losses, but the risk must be taken, because won clashes give Victory Points.<br/><br/>Non-activated units do not move, but they are allowed to fire. Thanks to that the whole board is used and crucial events can happen everywhere, not only in activated map sector. The most common effect of fire combat is Morale Check. If unsuccessful, unit can withdraw &ndash; decision is up to the opposing player, so both players are involved for the whole gameplay.<br/><br/>Generally random factor is big, but players can feel reality of Napoleonic battlefield. The winner is player who properly deploys his units and uses opportunities given by Fate of War.<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/>One game turn &ndash; 15 minutes of real time<br/>One hex &ndash; 150 meters<br/>One strength point &ndash; 100 infantrymen or cavalrymen<br/>One artillery counter &ndash; from 1 to 8 guns<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Mushrooms only feel good in a community, while magic trees like to live with a couple. The unicorn can be a propitiator for witches and fairies. And the dwarf likes to rest under the mushrooms, in the shade of the trees.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, everyone gets their own forest board, then we put together the pine tree elements - everyone has to put them in the same places! No more tiles can be placed on fields with such a pine tree. Then, each player must put 5 tiles of each character (dwarf, magic tree, mushroom, unicorn, fairy, witch) into the canvas bag and shake the bag well.<br/><br/>The game will last for 5 rounds and players will place 6 tiles on their board in each round - 2 tiles are placed face down first, then flipped over when everyone is done. After that, everyone passes the other cards to the left. This will continue until the bag is empty.<br/>Note: It is advisable to place the received tiles in such a way that they will be worth as many points as possible. The rulebook describes in detail which magic creature has what extra<br/><br/>The scoring sheet for the game also helps with scoring at the end of the game. Whoever has the most points will win.<br/><br/>The game can be played in several ways: in addition to the basic game, there are target cards at different levels of difficulty, which can also be added to the game as difficulty. Among the target cards, the easy and the hard ones can always be obtained by the person who succeeds in completing the task first, and the medium-level card is dealt at the end of the game to the player who has the most magical creatures of the type requested by the target card.<br/><br/>A thoughtful, somewhat strategic board game with nice graphics, in which cards are passed using a drafting technique.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ll have to act quickly to solve puzzles, fix equipment, and navigate the island in order to finish your show and help save the Gal&aacute;pagos Penguin<br/><br/>Gal&aacute;pagos Penguins, title #1 in the Endangered Rescue line, is an escape room style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.<br/><br/>When you have solved a puzzle, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next.<br/><br/>The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.<br/><br/>Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.<br/><br/>Most groups take about an hour to solve the game. You can write on the cards to help solve puzzles, but this is not required (or you could use penny sleeves) and the game is otherwise non-destructable.

Each player has their own set of conquest pieces.<br/><br/>On a turn, you must place a Triomino from your hand next to one or more Triominos in the playing area so that the numbers on the Triomino you place match the numbers on each adjacent edge it touches. If this placement creates the shape of one of your conquest pieces, you can place that conquest piece on these tiles to claim them; if your tile placement creates a shape that includes a smaller conquest piece, you can replace the smaller conquest piece with your larger one and return the smaller piece to its owner.<br/><br/>Once all the tiles have been placed, sum the numbers on the tiles under your conquest pieces to determine your score.

Or perhaps you are Prince Pelathar, heir to the throne of Sommerlund. Or maybe you are the infamous Giak warrior Kootak, sent by the Darklords to raze the land. Now you can be all of these... in a hand-painted (by Gary) tabletop wargame.<br/><br/>Battle for Magnamund is a fantasy wargame for two or more players. Each battle pits good against evil, and players may control either an entire army or a single brigade on one side at a time.  The goal is to allow you to re-create any battle or scenario from the classic Lone Wolf books, and the game comes with pre-made scenarios to start you on your way.<br/><br/>The core game set consists of flat cardboard figures (3 mm thick and die-cut) in a plastic base, played on card maps that are grid-based and modular.  The maps are the same material as in Cry Havoc, a previous (and popular) game of Gary's. In addition to being fun, Battle for Magnamund is a showcase for Gary Chalk's inimitable 2-D artwork: all components are illustrated by hand.<br/><br/>",

The first shape may be filled in anywhere, but future shapes must be adjacent to previous ones, and same colored shapes may not be adjacent.<br/><br/>In each game, a selection of event cards will give players points for meeting certain objectives, and each color of dice has a different scoring algorithm.  Some accomplishments, such as completing each mat of their room, will also earn the player money that they color in on their wallet and can spend for certain bonuses.<br/><br/>After 12 rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The main goal of Confabulation is to score points by spelling words. <br/>First, a category card is drawn and a category is chosen. This can be done by playing the categories in order, or by rolling a die or otherwise randomly selecting one if just one round is to be played. <br/>Second, each player is dealt 6 word cards, which have 3x3 grids of letters on them. A timer is set for three minutes. The players will use their own hand of cards to spell words in the selected category until the time runs out. <br/>The players can rearrange the cards as much as they would like; the cards can be rotated or overlapped. Players write down each word once they find it, then they can rearrange the cards (they don't have to preserve the configuration that allowed them to spell the word). <br/>When spelling words, any adjacent letters may be used, including diagonally-connected letters (similar to the mechanics of the game Boggle). Letters may only be used once in any given word. <br/>At the end of the round, points are counted. 3- and 4-letter words are worth one point, 5-letter words are worth 2 points, 6-letter words are worth 3 points, 7-letter words are worth 4 points, etc. <br/>Plural words do not count unless the word is naturally plural (eg. pants). Spelling the word 'mountains', for example, would count only as the 8-letter word 'mountain'.<br/>Proper nouns DO count if it makes sense in the category. (For example, if the category is 'science terms' then the word 'Einstein' would be allowed).<br/><br/>Players can challenge the spelling of another player's word. If the spelling is incorrect, the word does not count. <br/>Players can play as many or as few rounds as they want.<br/><br/>Alternative scoring:<br/>Instead of totaling the score of all words at the end of the round, the player who spelled the longest word in the three-minute time period is the winner.<br/><br/>Alternative gameplay:<br/>Players can adjust the number of cards dealt to each player or the amount of time in a round.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Use the weapons at hand, making the right combined decisions of how to fight against the various monsters without revealing too much information to them as blind trust in your crew may be the best chance you have to coordinate your strengths.<br/><br/>The Fight is played in fifty levels. Each level takes only a few minutes, with you fighting against a certain number of monsters. Typically, one monster lies face up in the center of play, and your crew needs to beat its strength value in one attack to win the fight. For each attack, you all place one card from your hand face down in front of you. If your revealed fighting total matches or exceeds the value of a face-up monster, you beat it; otherwise, the monster remains face up and keeps fighting.<br/><br/>To win a level, you can discuss your strategy with your crew. You can never talk about your card values in hand, but can debate whether you want to &quot;strike fast&quot; or &quot;take it slow&quot;. You can also use available special actions to gain the most benefits from them.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

All of which have different victory point values; the highest one announced gets played. Furthermore, an opposing player can announce to &quot;counter&quot; a contract and be the one to play it instead, which doubles the point value. In the 3-player variant, the two other players temporarily ally to win over the announcing player. In the 4-player game, you are permanently allied with the player sitting opposite you. The first player/group to reach 24 points will win the set. After an agreed upon number of won sets (with those won without any points gained by the opposing players, so-called Bummerl, counting double) is reached, the match ends.<br/><br/>",

Second, the players want to complete the unfinished church La Sagrada Familia. Towards this end, each player gets a number of jigsaw puzzle pieces which they have to buy during the game. The required money is earned by trading in language cards and asset cards. The game ends when one player has bought and laid out all their puzzle pieces and also manages to correctly solve five of the language cards he/she has collected during the game.<br/><br/>The game mechanics in more detail<br/><br/>A die determines the players' movement on the game board. The board contains the following types of spaces:<br/>Event spaces and special spaces: The player draws a card from the corresponding stack. Event cards must be played immediately, special cards can be kept until needed.<br/>Attraction spaces: The player receives an asset card of the corresponding tourist attraction. Different attractions have cards worth different amounts of money.<br/>Language spaces: The player gets a language card, which they have to learn during the game. Each language card contains two different words or phrases in German and Spanish.<br/>Metro spaces can be used either as a shortcut to a different metro space, or as an event, special or language space (player's choice).<br/>Bank spaces: On a bank space, the player can exchange asset and language cards for money. To do so, they must have learned the language cards. During an exchange attempt, one asset card and two language cards are submitted. The German words are read out, and if the active player correctly translates them to Spanish, he/she receives the amount of money specified on the asset card. If they fail, they get back their cards and can try again later.<br/>Casa de Pledras spaces: The player can pay for one of his puzzle pieces to be added to the puzzle that is laid out on the table (all players contribute to one puzzle).<br/><br/>",

All these cards show six colors that is their &quot;price&quot;: when the player can pay the coins of these colors they get points (depending on the number of coins left in hand). Players roll the dice and get the coin of the color that's shown on the dice. OR they can use the exchange rates shown on two chosen exchange ratio cards (so e.g. they get 3 blue and a red coin for one yellow and a green coin etc.). The aim of the game is to collect most points until all cards are played.<br/><br/>",

Drawn from diverse backgrounds, some are explorers, others are scholars, but all the ladies and gentlemen are drawn together by one thing &ndash; the occult!<br/><br/>Their curiosity and thirst for knowledge of the arcane arts draws them towards it like so many moths to an open flame. In their plush and exclusive London Club they meet to discuss their latest exploits - the artifacts uncovered, the diabolical schemes foiled, and the supernatural terrors they have hunted.<br/><br/>The unofficial motto of the club is &rsquo;Possession is 9/10th of the lore.&rsquo; An offhand joke maybe, yet many say it perfectly captures the club&rsquo;s healthy spirit of competition and the very real danger its members face every time they set out on another paranormal investigation.<br/><br/>In Ghost Hunter players take on the role of  new Infernal Club members and set out on a quest to the notorious Blackmoor House to compete against their fellow hunters to capture as many of the unholy spirits that haunt it as possible without succumbing to the terror and ending up haunted for life!<br/><br/>Ghost Hunter is a card game for 2 &ndash; 7 players that should last between 10-30 minutes. Players take it in turns to lay higher and higher cards on a central stack. If a player can&rsquo;t lay an equal or higher card on the stack then they have to pick it up. If a player manages to lay a group of 3 cards at once then they get to capture the stack. Plenty of the cards come with special rules that you can manipulate to turn the game your way. The first player to play all of their cards ends the game and then players count up the scores of all of the cards that they captured minus all of the cards that they didn&rsquo;t manage to get rid of. The player with the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>The rules are simple but the strategies can be complex. Skill and luck play their parts in equal measure in this short but engaging card game. It pays to get rid of your cards and be the Ghost Hunter who ends the game but victory is never assured until the final scores are counted.<br/><br/>",

If the castle (enemy deck) is hit, it loses cards based on the accuracy of the hit and type of card thrown. Dead Mammoths deal more damage then severed heads. When a player's castle runs out of cards, it is considered to have been razed to the ground and they lose.<br/><br/>You can use sneaky tactics cards to foil your foes plans and fight ground troops using rock, paper, scissors (each unit getting advantages and disadvantages which decide draws.)<br/><br/>It's a fast paced game which lasts around five minutes per bout, but rest assured, as soon as you're done, you'll want another chance to hone your throwing technique and grind your enemy's castle into dust.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Anzio: Operation Shingle covers the initial Allied landings on the 22nd January to the failure of the second German offensive, Operation Seitensprung, to eliminate the beachhead on the 1st March.  The whole campaign can be replayed as well as several scenarios covering key parts of the battle. The game also allows alternative plans to be explored such as the original plan for the US 504th parachute regiment to be airdropped just outside Carroceto on the Via Anziate.<br/><br/>Extract from draft design notes...<br/><br/>&hellip;In order to calculate the hex grid needed I looked into the area required to deploy regimental sized units. German, American and British regimental units varied in size and composition, and by 1944 most units were suffering some level of depletion of manpower. Couple this with documented doctrinal frontages rarely being achieved on the ground and the calculation of accurate frontages becomes very problematic. A German infantry division in 1944 had three infantry regiments as well as an assortment of artillery, support and HQ companies and battalions. Each German infantry regiment consisted of two battalions. Bull (2005) states a German battalion in an attack frontage would occupy 400-1000m, and Rottman (2004) has their defensive frontage as 800-2000m. Disregarding any particular formations if these two battalions were placed in line the regiment would need:<br/><br/>German Regimental Frontages <br/>Attack 800-2000m &frac12; mile to 1&frac14; miles <br/>Defense 1600-4000m 1 mile to 2&frac12; miles<br/><br/>British brigades (equivalent to regiments) and US regiments were somewhat larger than their German counterparts, having an additional infantry battalion. Doctrine would seldom recommend placing all of a regiments units in line, with some elements held back in reserve, so using with the above German calculation offers a useful yardstick.<br/><br/>The next design problem then emerged, how to simulate the different frontages of units and the particular advantages and disadvantages of each? Units in a defensive frontage should be able to defend a longer front and have some defensive advantage. Units in an attack frontage should be able to concentrate their strength and have the advantage of easier movement. The game simulates different frontages by allowing units to be within a single hex (attack frontage) or two hexes (defensive frontage) - additional aspects of the differing frontages are discussed later.<br/><br/>So using the German regimental frontage above I calculated that a single hex needed to be able to contain a regiment in an attack frontage of &frac12; to 1&frac14; miles. Taking into account that the allied formations were a little larger a scale of 1&frac12; miles across each hex seems suitable. A regiment in a defensive frontage would cover around 3 miles. Each hex contains around 3&frac12; square miles.<br/><br/>This hex grid was then placed over a map of the campaign area and adjustments made in order for the grid to fit&hellip;<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ll need skill, luck, and guts if you want to win this tricky little dice game.<br/><br/>Scuttleball is a 2-player dice-placement game that fits in a mint tin. Despite its small size, short rules, and bunch of dice, it offers a surprising amount of tense tactical moments and thematic tie-ins. At the beginning of each round, or volley, both players roll nine dice concealed behind their hands. Players alternate making a play on the ball by placing a die on their side of the court that exceeds the value of the last played die. The volley continues until one player can't make a play. Here's the exciting part: every space on the court has a special action that is activated when a die is placed. Actions are things like reroll a die, boost its value, or mirror an adjacent die. You&rsquo;ll have to activate the right ability at the right time if you want to keep the volley going!<br/><br/>Scuttleball contains three different courts to accommodate different skill levels and game preferences: backyard (casual), beach (standard), or gymnasium (expert).

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>In August 1942, Erwin Rommel, the &quot;Desert Fox,&quot; had just completed his masterpiece of the desert war, breaking the British Eighth Army at Gazala, capturing Tobruk, and driving deep into Egypt. The British reformed near El Alamein, just 90 miles from Alexandria. After the repulse of a hasty attack in mid-July, Rommel orchestrated a more careful assault for the end of the month. His mobile troops were to swing wide into the desert to flank the British line and unhinge it. Eighth Army was waiting, forewarned by ULTRA intercepts. Its new commander, Bernard Mongomery, arrayed his armor along the ridge of Alam el Halfa. The German assault would pit the tactical finesse of Afrika Korps against greater numbers of tanks and guns. A German victory might complete the clearance of North Africa; a British victory could spell the end of Afrika Korps. El Alamein uses the Fire &amp; Movement system designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>",

The purpose of the game is to cross words, aiming at placing all the letters on the grid.<br/><br/>The player draws at random 10 of the 48 letter tiles, then forms a two- to nine-letter word on the grid. The player then draws the same number of pieces as the letters played, so as to still have 10 letters at their disposal. A new word is formed, adding horizontally or vertically, to the previous word. And so on. The player continues placing words, with the goal being to dispose of all 48 letters. (Parallel words are allowed providing all letters form a word. Also, two words should always be separated by a free square.)<br/><br/>Difficulty Levels<br/>To make the game easier, take out a number of pieces, taking care to remove as many vowels as consonants. To make a harder game: before starting, draw one or several letters and place them anywhere on the grid, blank side up. These will be dead squares, as in a crossword puzzle. OR you can reveal the letters, then &quot;cross words according to the normal rule, incorporating the pieces already disposed on the grid.&quot;<br/><br/>Game contents:<br/>Wooden game board with 9x9 grid and grooves along each edge to hold letter tiles, 48 wooden letter tiles (letters of the alphabet plus one joker).<br/><br/>",

Emeralds, diamonds, rubies, precious objects&hellip; GOLD! All was hidden in a cave which was open and sealed magically. To open the cave they prounounced the words &ldquo;Open Sesame!&rdquo; and, to seal it, &ldquo;Close sesame!&rdquo;. While the greedy thieves were out, Ali Baba entered the caved and took some of their treasures.<br/><br/>Ali Baba&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s Cassim, dishonest and usurer, discovered the sudden wealth of his sibling and followed him to the cave, where he entered unseen. Fooled by his own greed and excitement to so many treasures, Cassim forgot the magic words and was found by the thieves, who carved him up due to his temerity.<br/><br/>Now you will play as Ali and Cassim and, with your loyal servant Moxana&rsquo;s help, will get the highest number of treasures in The Magic Cave without being noticed by the Forty Thieves.<br/><br/>Take all the components from the box and leave the box in the center of the table. Put inside the box all 20 small treasure cards and close it. Place uniformally all 40 big treasure cards surrounding the game box. Deal to each player 1 character card, 2 Moxana cards of the same color and 3 carrots to each player.<br/><br/>The 20 treasure tokens have the same treasure pictures as the 40 large tokens. On the small tokens there is a treasure on each side, on the large tokens there is a treasure on one side and the drawing of a thief on the other.<br/><br/>There are 4 rounds. At the beginning of the round one player has the open box at least 5 seconds (min), and next he close the box. The box does not reopen until the end of the round. In your turn, you can play as Ali (as picking up as much large treasures as pointing to the dice, treasures that have to be visible face up inside the box), if you wrong, you will deduct points. If you don't remember more of the treasures that are in the box face up, you play like Cassim. Cassim flip the big treasures to hinder the other players. If you play like Cassim you can't play as Ali until the next round. The round ends when everyone have been played as Cassim. Successful and failed treasures are checked.<br/><br/>Treasures and special characters help the players to get more points or subtracting rival's points.<br/><br/>The player who earns more points with the treasures wins.<br/><br/><br/>ES // Cuenta la historia que Al&iacute; Bab&aacute;, un pobre le&ntilde;ador de Persia, descubre el tesoro oculto de una banda de 40 ladrones.

A witch has turned the players into frogs and they must race through her lair to find a cure (cure is a cauldron spinner which will either leave you as a frog or transform you back to human form).<br/><br/>The movement mechanic is where this game shines. 54 cardboard tiles (6 ghosts, 6 spiders, 42 footsteps with 1, 2 or 3 steps each) are used as a movement pool. To move players can turn over as many cards as they wish but try to avoid the ghosts and spiders. Players movement is equal to the number of footsteps they turn over. If they flip a ghost they must move backwards. Spiders stop you in your tracks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sub-title:&rsquo; It&rsquo;s Finest Hour at Gettysburg', and is about this Unit's involvement during the 1st Day of the epic 3-Day Battles that followed. The &quot;IRON Brigade&quot; at this point, consisted of the following Units: the 19th Indiana Regiment, the 24th Michigan Regiment, plus the 2nd, &amp; 7th Wisconsin Regiments commanded by Brig.Gen. -Solomon Meredith, with elements of the 142nd &amp; 151st Pennsylvania Regiments. The 6th Wisconsin Regiment had been a part of the original Brigade but had been 'absorbed' due to previous losses into the other units while the 24th Michigan was added later on. They were also known as the 'Black Hat' Brigade due to their distinctive head apparel and were well respected among their foes &amp; peers. There is an excellent photo-depiction of a 're-enactment' group in full uniform on the front cover of the game box complete with their 'ostrich plumed' hats!<br/><br/>The components consist of the following: a thin 'book-case' style cardboard box; a RULES Booklet; a 7-COLOR 17&quot; by 22&quot; paper Map sheet; 2-Sets of cardboard counters (200 total); &amp; Players must provide their OWN (2)~6-sided DICE prior to playing. This is considered to be of Moderate Complexity according to its authors. The game scale is given as: 30-yards across per HEX; Elevation intervals of 10~20-feet; each Strength Point=15-Men; and 1-Turn=6-Minutes.<br/><br/>On the Map sheet are: the Battle Area of a portion of McPherson's Ridge about 1-Mile West of Gettysburg; the Sequence of Play; a Game Turn Track with the 2-Scenarios displayed (a separate Morning~7-Turns &amp; an Afternoon~10-Turns); &amp; a Terrain Key. There are (4)-shades of BROWN to depict varying Elevations as well as Light TAN for the lowest, BLUE for Stream, &amp; GREEN for Woods, while Fences &amp; Contour lines are in BROWN. The Game counters are printed Front &amp; Back with Light BLUE with BLACK print for the Union, &amp; Light GRAY with RED &amp; BLACK print for the Confederates (RED-Morning Scenario, BLACK-Afternoon), and WHITE with RED &amp; BLACK print for informational, replacement Officers, &amp; Strength Point markers. The counters also have various 'Hat' &amp; 'Cap' silhouettes on them to represent the Unit types while some of the informational ones have a soldier(s) silhouette(s) on them for dispositions such as 'Charge', 'Melee', 'Volley Fire', etc.<br/><br/>The RULES detail the Historical background by Dr. David G. Martin, with a decent listing of reference materials. The last page contains the COMMAND Point Chart, MOVEMENT Point Chart, MORALE Table- (with Morale Modifiers detailed) while the REVERSE side of the page has the MELEE Combat Results Table, MELEE Combat Modifiers, &amp; SPONTANEOUS Rally Chart.<br/><br/>For those of you familiar with the previous works of this duo, this game follows along those same lines. The Sequence of Play is as follows: [1]~1st Player Turn-A.PREP.COMMAND Phase-1) Spontaneous Rally, 2) Leader Replacement, 3) Check Command Radius, 4) Rally Ordered B.EXECUTION Phase. -1) Issue Orders, 2) Conduct Movement C.FIRE COMBAT Phase-1) Defensive Fire, 2) Offensive Fire D.MELEE Phase-1) Charge Movement, 2) Declare Attacks, 3) Withdraw or Stand, 4) Melee Combat Resolved. [2]~2nd Player repeats Phases A-D. [3]~Victory Point Phase [4]~Game Turn Ends.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Paper Cricket was first devised by Luke Morris in 1993 as a child trying to pass the time on long car journeys. With the rules written down for the first time, Paper Cricket is now available, for free, to everyone.<br/><br/>Paper Cricket is a simple game that aims to provide a bit of entertainment if you&rsquo;re stuck as a passenger on a very boring car/train/plane journey or when you&rsquo;re stuck late at work with nothing but some paper, a pencil (or pen) and a dice. At its&rsquo; most simple you need nothing else.<br/><br/>Paper Cricket does NOT intend to perfectly simulate the ebb and flow of a cricket match BUT from experience it does enough to provide realistic scores, averages and statistics. Cricket, like baseball, is a game of statistics.<br/><br/>With simple play rules (and optional squad selection mechanics) it's a game to pick up and play wherever you are and whatever you're doing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>Today I began full-on work on my next CounterFact magazine design, 1938: What If? which presumes the Czechoslovakians refused to accept the Munich Dictat. Longer story short: On or around 1 October, the Germans put &quot;Operation Green&quot; into effect and war starts. The sides are: the Czechoslovakians and Soviets vs. the Germans, Poles and Hungarians.<br/><br/>I believe my treatment is original here in that, unlike all the games I'm familiar with on this topic, I'm presenting an examination of the larger picture here. That is, rather than the map just covering Bohemia/Moravia and environs, this one shows (at 20 miles per hex) all of Czechoslovakia and Poland, along with the German, Hungarian, Romanian, Lithuanian and Soviet border lands thereunto appertaining.<br/><br/>The turns equal three days each, and the game has a maximum of 10 turns. Units of maneuver are two-step corps all around, except the Germans' 7th Flieger (proto)-division gets its own counter (and a likely suicide mission).<br/><br/>I'm using an adaptation of my &quot;Zhukov's War&quot; system (which doesn't mean anything to any of you yet, because that parent design itself hasn't yet appeared.<br/><br/>At the system's core, there are 10 chits, one for each maneuverable nationality's movement phase and another for each one's combat phase (the Lithuanians, if they get dragged in, just defend their capital; so there's no chit for them).<br/><br/>All but the two German chits go into a pool at the start of every turn. The two German chits are held out. The German player may interpose either of those chits at any time in the turn (together or separately, in either order), but otherwise the phase sequence is determined by blind draw (and, in this particular case, Turn 1 will always start with the German combat phase, thereby kicking off the overall war).<br/><br/>That system neatly shows the advantages of having the advantage in C3.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kobolds &amp; Cobblestones is a skirmish wargame for rumbles between gangs in the city of Ordinsport's seedy underbelly. Players hire gangs of criminals, thugs and enforcers from a number of classic Fantasy races, and attempt to take control of the underworld and establish themselves as the city's kingpins.<br/><br/>Forgoing dice and measuring sticks, the game instead relies on playing cards. All distances are measured in card lengths or widths, combat is resolved by poker hands, and magic by blackjack. Players alternate activating models. Game objectives are by scenario - the rulebook provides eight different ones, ranging from &quot;Hide and Seek&quot; to &quot;All Out Brawl&quot;.<br/><br/>The game has a strong emphasis on campaign play, with players recruiting their gang, pitting them against one another, and seeing them grow (or wither) from game to game. Interestingly, the money you use between games to recruit can also be used during games to encourage your fighters, or bribe the enemy's. Money can also be stolen from enemy gangers during a game.<br/><br/>Each game pits two players with their gangs against one another, but many players can participate in the same campaign, meeting various opponents across it.<br/><br/>",

The players simultaneously pick one card and play it on the table. Next, they pass the unused cards to the player on the left. Using the received cards, the players play another card and add it to their kingdoms. The game continues to the moment of playing the ninth, final card.<br/><br/>Each played card makes your kingdom grow. You just have to follow 3 simple rules:<br/><br/>Apart from the first card, each following card must be placed adjacent to the card which is already on the table.<br/>Your kingdom has to form 3x3 square.<br/><br/>The cards can be added freely and don&rsquo;t have to match the ones already added to the kingdom.<br/><br/>After completing their kingdoms the players go to the scoring phase. Firstly, the players receive the edict cards, starting with the &bdquo;Kingsroad&rdquo; edict. It goes to the player with the longest connected road in the kingdom. Next, the rest of the edict cards are handed to the players who met their requirements.<br/>Additionally, the players score points for the individual terrains in their kingdom. The terrains with the highest number of different symbols generate points, which are then indicated by the scorecards.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Easy and fun memory game youngest family!<br/><br/>More about the game:<br/><br/>Game comes with a cloth bag, a dog figure and 2 small houses that can put together.<br/>Each player on his turn takes out 3 tiles.<br/>On each tile there are different pictures. For example cat, marbled and a smile. Now, children need to find pictures that go together. Like smile and teeth, or cat and mouse, marbles and balls. There can be many variations in which parents are the judges about the pairs.<br/>Each time players get a pair, parent take on tile from the bag and place it back side up between the houses.

During the draft phase players will draft a total of 13 cards to create their hand of cards for the build phase. During the draft phase players draft building cards and advanced resource cards, with the goal of collecting card that work well together in synergy.<br/><br/>The build phase lasts over 8 rounds, in which players will gather resources and build the cards picked during the draft phase. The game ends at the end of the 8th round. The winner is the player who has gathered the most points at the end of the game, which will require skill and strategy during both the draft and building phases.<br/><br/>Good luck on your adventure Town Builders!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each of 3 to 5 players represents a clan (Wolf, Bear, Turtle, Eagle, or Deer) within the Iroquois Confederation during this time and attempts to gain control of Confederation policy and the beaver trade.&quot;<br/><br/>There are two main elements that players must deal with - influencing the five nations to follow your clan and attacking the enemy tribes.<br/><br/>Each nation grants a different benefit when it follows your leadership. Control of a nation is determined with an area control/influence mechanism.  If one is willing to surrender their influence during a council turn, more beaver tokens (victory points) are earned.<br/><br/>When attacking neighboring tribes, other clans may join yours in the attack.  Their help will improve the chances of victory, but means the spoils will be shared.  Success is determined by a simple superiority of numbers after the defending tribe has had a chance to eliminate the attackers.  Success earns the survivors a share of that tribe's beaver furs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players take turns placing wooden planks of varying length onto a 10x11 square grid. Each player plays planks of one color. Neutral planks may be distributed on the grid prior to the game, creating variable starting positions. Players' planks may be played directly onto the gameboard, or on top of other planks at equal height. Planks may intersect over only one square, and a plank must be played on top of at least one plank of its own color. The game ends when neither player can place further planks; scores are assessed according to the area enclosed by each player's planks. Because it is often advantageous to place last, matches are played in pairs where each player goes first once.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game of the Allied invasion of Sicily, 1943.<br/><br/><br/>(from the publisher:)<br/><br/>Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. BSO, however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or heavy weapons). No CRTs, no siree!<br/><br/>The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They don&rsquo;t 'drive' the game and they can be left out, if you&rsquo;re so inclined.)  The cards are turned into a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards or rally units. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.<br/><br/>The cards, themselves, give the players 'Opportunities', from using their Tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Reaction movement, to appearances by Patton and Monty.<br/><br/>Playing time for BITTER VICTORY has averaged 3 hours, sometimes less, and the rules are only 8 pages, including a section on Solitaire play!<br/><br/>Available in English or French<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    1 rules and scenario booklet with historical introduction (8 pages)<br/>    1 A1 map of Sicily <br/>    20 colored Opportunity Cards <br/>    224 counters (NATO Symbols) <br/>    1 Aid Cards<br/><br/><br/>The Sicily map and the Opportunity Cards have been designed by Pascal Da Silva.<br/><br/>",

But just as the technology matured, high-performance aircraft, a spectacular accident caught on film and the Great Depression combined to bring an end to military and most civilian use of the rigid airship.<br/><br/>Airships is a supplement for our Great War at Sea series of games, building on the popular Zeppelins to take a further look at lighter than air operations. There are ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on missions that took place or could have taken place. All are by Ernie Wheeler and Doug McNair.<br/><br/>This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of our Zeppelins supplement and Jutland and Mediterranean games to play most of the scenarios, and our U.S. Navy Plan Gold game and Sea of Troubles and Dreadnoughts supplements to play all of them.

The exact origin of the game is unknown but it was actively played as a paper-and-pencil game in Saint Petersburg State University in 80s. There were several variants of the game with slightly different rules.<br/><br/>Players must make five steps per turn. Each step is either placing a new virus on the board or &quot;zombifying&quot; one of the enemy viruses. The goal of the game is to leave the opponent without legal moves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You&rsquo;re a military demolitions expert working in hostile territory that&rsquo;s been called in to defuse a massive car bomb found outside a luxury resort hotel.  You&rsquo;ve evacuated the parking lot and setup your equipment; you begin to examine the bomb when suddenly the bomb timer starts to countdown from 16 minutes and your heart rate just went into overdrive.  Upon further inspection you notice the bomb is controlled by an encrypted code sequencer and you need to figure out how to connect your Code Analyzer to the bomb&rsquo;s timer.  Your new high-tech Code Analyzer is used to bypass the bomb&rsquo;s timer and prevent the bomb from exploding. To do this you must figure out the wiring sequence from the mass of wires in front of you and rewiring the device to include your code analyzer, which will override the timer and allow you to defuse the bomb safely!  You have less than 16 minutes to figure out the wiring sequence and connect your Code Analyzer.  If you can figure out this circuit and connect each of the four individual wires from the bomb timer to your code analyzer, you will safely stop the timer and eventually defuse the bomb; saving the resort from certain disaster!  Countdown to disaster begins&hellip;<br/><br/>Countdown to Disaster is a combination tile placement, card management game and race against the clock style game. Your Code Analyzer has [4] color coded wires &ldquo;Red, Green, Blue and Yellow&rdquo; which must be connected to the timer of the bomb so as to be able to bypass the timer and prevent the bomb from exploding! These connections will be made through the [16] wire routing tiles on the game board. The bomb itself is amass of wires, which is represented by the 4x4 grid of wire tiles on the game board that are routed in different directions to try and prevent you from defusing the robot. Your goal is to figure out the four individual wire routes to connect your code analyzer to the robot's timer. You must figure out a complete connection route for each wire from the code analyzer to the bomb's timer before the timer runs out and the bomb explodes!<br/>You have special wiring tools that allow you to manipulate the wires and create or change the route of each existing wire or wires. With your tools in hand you can swap wires vertically and horizontally 1, 2, or 3 spaces. You can also rotate the direction of a specific wire or wire group up to 360 degrees. The last tool allows you to actually cut out &ldquo;replace&rdquo; a wire or wire group with a new wire or wire group from the bottom four tiles! When you replace a wire or wire group you can rotate the tile to the position of your choice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ciapan&ograve; (also known by the names Rovescino, Traversone, Busca, Vinciperde and Mattazza) is a trick-taking game where the goal is not to get points.<br/><br/>A 40 card pack is used. In each suit the cards rank as follows: 3 (highest), 2, Asso (ace), Re (king), Cavallo (horse, or queen), Fante (jack), 7, 6, 5, 4 (lowest).<br/><br/>The cards have point values and the object is to avoid taking tricks containing valuable cards. There is an extra penalty for winning the last trick. The values of the cards are as follows:<br/><br/>Each ace                           1 point<br/>Each 3, 2, re, cavallo or fante    1/3 of a point<br/><br/>Deal (anticlockwise) 8 cards to each player for 5 players, 10 each for 4 players and 13 each for 3 players (in this case the dealer receives 14 cards and discards one card, which will be given to the winner of the last trick). Turn to deal passes to the right after each hand.<br/><br/>There are no trumps. The player to dealer's right leads first. Any card may be led, and the other players must play a card of the suit led if they have one. A player with no card of the suit led may play anything. The highest card of the suit led wins the trick, and the winner leads to the next trick.<br/><br/>When all tricks have been played, the values of cards taken in tricks are counted. Each player except the winner of the last trick scores as penalty points the value of the cards they have taken, disregarding any fractions - for example a player who has taken three and one thirds point scores 3; a player who has taken just two thirds of a point scores nothing. The scores of all the players for one hand should add up to 11, so the player who won the last trick scores the difference between 11 and the total of the amounts scored by the other players.<br/><br/>If one player wins all the points, this is called Cappotto. The player with all the points scores zero for the hand and the opponents score 11 each.<br/><br/>Any player whose cumulative score is 31 or more points drops out of the game and does not play any more. The last people left in play (1, 2 or 3 as players as agreed in advance) win the match. Alternately, some play that when a player reaches or exceeds 31, the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Overlap is a card game using small, square cards, each with nine squares that are each colored red, yellow, or blue. The goal of the game is to score points by placing cards such that squares of the same color align. As the name suggests, the cards can overlap one another, adding another level of strategy and requiring spatial-reasoning and critical thinking skills.<br/><br/>How to play:<br/><br/>Set up: Shuffle the deck of cards, then deal each player five cards. Each player places this stack of cards face down in front of them. Place one card from the deck face up in the center of the playing surface.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  Choose a starting player. That player draws the top card from his/her stack and plays it on the playing surface following card placement rules, and then calculates and records his/her score for the turn. Play then continues clockwise. When all players have placed all their cards, the round ends and the cards are shuffled back into the deck. The number of rounds corresponds with the number of players, with each player having an opportunity to go first.<br/><br/>Card placement: Cards may be placed adjacent to other cards in play, but they must be played so that at least one square aligns with a square on an adjacent card. Additionally, they may be played so that the cards partially overlap, as long as the squares align. When cards are played, at least one square must lie over an empty space (you cannot occlude 9 squares with any given card.)<br/><br/>Scoring: When you place a card, any instance in which a square of a certain color lies next to a square of that same color on another card is worth one point. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Now, symbols are divided into five categories, with each category including four different symbols&mdash;when the animal category is rolled, look for the alligator, elephant, giraffe, and dog in the given color. This version also includes more discs than the original, with 48 discs instead of just 36.<br/><br/>CLACK! is both the name of the game and the sound that the magnetic discs in the game will make when you slap one against another &ndash; and slap them together you will as you're trying to claim the right discs as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>To set up the game, lay out all 48 discs face up so that everyone can see the colored symbols on them. One player rolls the two dice &ndash; one showing colors, the other symbols &ndash; then everyone simultaneously tries to grab any discs showing the colored symbol determined by the die roll. If a die shows a white face instead of a color or symbol, then that characteristic is ignored for the round. For example, if the roll is white (i.e., blank) and red, then players can grab any disc with a red symbol. If both dice show white, then it's a free-for-all, with players grabbing as many discs as possible!<br/><br/>A player can use only one hand to grab discs. If a player accidentally grabs the wrong disc, she must return that disc to the playing area, along with an additional disc as a penalty. When all the discs have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most discs wins!<br/><br/>",

We were just there, and it basically came down to staying alive and keeping your buddies alive.&rdquo; &ndash;Pfc. Edward W. Voros, Company A, 46th Infantry, Americal Division, March 1971.<br/><br/>For most Americans, by the Spring of 1971, the &ldquo;light at the end of tunnel&rdquo; that had become the War in Vietnam was in sight. Peace talks were well underway in Paris, as was &ldquo;Vietnamization&rsquo;; President Nixon&rsquo;s official policy for turning over the bulk of the war effort and fighting to the forces of the ARVN (Army of the Republic of [South] Vietnam). As part of the transition the 23rd US Infantry Division, the &ldquo;Americal&rdquo;, was due to be rotated out of fighting and turning over its positions to ARVN&rsquo;s First Corp. The Americal had earned a bad reputation two years earlier at My Lai, and the division was subjected to a complete review and re-organization following that atrocity. The higher-ups decreed there would be no more &ldquo;screw ups&rdquo; by this unit while it served out its remaining time &ldquo;in country.&rdquo;<br/><br/>One of the most remote American positions was Fire Base Mary Ann, not far from Chu Lai, occupied by elements of the 46th Regiment of the Americal Division. By the last week of March an ARVN artillery battery had already moved in and the base was to be completely turned-over in early April. However, the local Viet Cong (Communist South Vietnamese) commander saw a growing opportunity during the transition to strike a final blow against the Imperialist forces of the US. Deploying the elite 409th Sapper Battalion for the attack, the Communist&rsquo;s &ldquo;parting shot&rdquo; was to remind both the US and ARVN that the war was far from over.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterpart?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Play revolves around 36 weather cards which have different weather symbols; 1, 2 or 3 white or black clouds. The board is a 4x4 grid with pictures of different houses along the vertical and horizontal planes, the higher the house, the better the initial weather. The game starts with weather tiles being randomly placed face down onto the grid. The tiles stay that way for much of the game, which means Donnerwetter has a memory element. The idea is to place your prediction marker and trying to change the weather tiles to match. The rest of the game is spent moving and laying tiles with limited intelligence, trying to get your predictions to come right.<br/><br/>Designed for ages  Ages 10 and up.<br/><br/>",

Each card contains a unique combination of four colors. Players take turns, and in each turn they place one stone of their choice on the game board. They try to complete one of their QUARTINO cards, i.e. create a color combination matching one of their cards. Game stones can be placed on top of each other. For the completion of QUARTINO, only the top stones count.<br/>If a player completes a QUARTINO on the game board, he shows the card and removes all stones from the QUARTINO from the game board. Then she plays again, i.e. places a new stone.<br/>Whoever completes all his QUARTINO cards first, wins the game.<br/>Before each player&acute;s turn, two special rules can come to play:<br/>If there are 4 or more stones of the same color on the board (all stones, not just top stones), the player can say &ldquo;color&rdquo; and place an additional stone.<br/>if there are 4 or more stones of any color on top of each other on the board, the player needs to remove all the stones in such columns. The player can then place an additional stone.<br/><br/>QUARTINO - theory of game <br/>Rules for QUARTINO game you can find in the box, but here you can find some tips how to play successfully.<br/><br/>Of course, you can play randomly without much thought and analysis, which we recommend especially when you play with children or when play 3 or more players.

You will find that some of them can have up to 3 positions in the same color combinations. Imagine a order of place stones so that your opponent does not have a chance to make a combination from another card after your turn.<br/>2) Imagine before your turn whether your opponent could make a combination after place your stone. You don't have to count the combination you have and the ones your opponent has already created and placed on table.<br/>3) Before first turn: Look closely on cards you have and try to find pair with some common color combination. This can help you to win one of them easily.<br/>4) If you place first stone, try to make rule &quot;Column&quot;(4 stones in one column) as fast as possible, but only in situation, when opponent don't have chance to make combination. It will help you to avoid situation when is on board 12 stones (3 pieces from each color) and you have to place 4. stone from some color. <br/>5) Try to remember stone colors and their positions your opponent try to place. You can learn from this his card combinations.<br/><br/>Lot of those tips use players at QUARTINO tournaments. Game is a bit longer then, but you can use e.g. chess clock to limit time for one game.<br/><br/>",

The players are dragons who try to rescue a pre-defined number of younglings from their collapsing dungeon (the more, the harder). Lots of side-quests and exciting dramatic main game, the console rolls the die, keeps track of the dragon's levels and quests, parts of the fights are a small dexterity game. The playing time can vary between one and four hours (depending on the number of players and the chosen difficulty level).<br/><br/>The magical land Tarascon: Imagine you are the last reminiscent of an ancient dragon race. Your task is now to protect the descendants of the tribe's mother Tarasque. Fight using magic, in direct combat and with strategic sophistication to prevent extinction.<br/>Tarascon is a rpg-style board game designed for the Yvio console. You take the role of one of four dragons, each with different values in attack, defense and speed. Seated in the cave of Tarasque you'll have to pick up a dragon egg and take it to a nest. After a short while Yvio will inform you that there's a hatchling hiding in one of the rune chambers. Search for it and take it out of the cave to win the game (difficulty could be set to 2, 3 or 4 eggs, too).<br/>During game play you will have to level-up your character, fight creatures and you can take on quests that the console is offering. You have to consider each decision wisely because the cave will start to crumble at some time during the game. If all the chambers are destroyed before one player fulfilled his task all players lose and Yvio wins.<br/><br/>",

These warlords are the clan leaders of specific territories.  Each have characteristics that are based on history.<br/><br/>Players, in secret, choose a castle territory.  When all players choose their castle territory players place their castle into their castle territory.<br/><br/>Clan tokens are placed in territories owned.  Players who wish to make certain warlords strong will stack clan tokens into these warlords.  Clan tokens represent both 1000 samurai and 1 HP for that character.<br/><br/>Players make 3 actions in turn.  This happens twice which represents 1 decade or 1 round of play.  Players draw cards and get Clan Token bonuses after each half decade.<br/><br/>Actions:  Bribe, attack, move, castle movement.<br/><br/>Bribe:  Bribe an adjoining warlord by committing 1 clan token to the action.  11 or 12 must be rolled on the dice.  If successful the committed clan token goes on top of the enemy warlord and his character card is given to the attacking player.  The warlord has switched sides.  If the bribe is unsuccessful the committed clan token gets put into the clan token stack of the adjoining warlord.<br/><br/>Attack:<br/>Attack an adjoining enemy.  Advance as many warlords and their samurai armies to the border of the enemy territory.  The enemy may play cards against you at this time, do defensive troop movements.  The attacker may also play cards against the enemy.  Once card play is completed the attacker must choose which warlord will go into the duel.<br/><br/>The warlords duel!  D12's are rolled.  The attacker always gets +1 and the difference of the dice determines the damage.  Damage is counted by removing Clan Tokens from the stack of the warlord.  In a duel, the Clan Tokens now represent the HP of the warlord for the duel.  When Clan Tokens are gone the warlord is slain and the victor can move as many or no warlords and/or clan tokens into the claimed territory.<br/><br/>Movement Action: During a player's turn they may move as many warlords and/or clan tokens from one territory to another territory that is connected through ownership of land.<br/><br/>Castle Movement Action: requiring an entire decade (4 actions) a player may move their castle from one territory to another territory that is connected through ownership of land.<br/><br/>Object of Game:<br/>Destroy all enemy castles.  If your castle remains standing you win.  Or, Dueling Samurai has a points scoring system that lets players end the game at the end of any half decade.  This being a tested tournament game, the points scoring system is easy to follow and very well developed.<br/><br/>Card Play:<br/>Players may play cards at any time in the game, making this a highly engaging and interactive board game.  <br/>Bonus Cards: (Archers, Dueling Samurai, Horses and Ambush)  These have individual use in the game, but can also be combined during your turn to get more clan tokens.  There is a very challenging balance between hording these cards and using them for combat making the strategy very deep.<br/><br/>Tournament Cards: (Sumo and Dojo)<br/>Host a tournament.  If you win there are big rewards.  If you lose it can be a devastating turning point.<br/><br/>Attack Cards:  Religious Conversion, Spy, Ninja, Small Pox Demons, Demons, Revenge, Sniper Cannons, Riflemen, Battering Rams, Cannons, Navy, Assassin, Ronin, Pirates, Bandits, Inciting Revolt.  These cards (other than Ninja) can be played at any time in the game.  Each utilize D12 or D6 to deal damage.  1's are always fails and so are 2's on D12's.  On fails players roll against themselves.<br/><br/>Defense Cards: These are used to block attack cards, often reversing the attack to a more devastating effect.  Some of them can be played anytime you are under attack, providing a defensive attack option.  Chinese medicine, Knife Cart, Furious Defense, Scouts, Gold, Bushido, Seppuku.<br/><br/>Peace Cards:  These are used to create peace.

Momo finds out that spooky 'grey men'  are tempting people to bring them their time to save it in a time savings bank.  In fact they are stealing their time.  The more time they save, the colder, sadder, more hurried and poor their existence becomes.<br/><br/>Finally, with the help of a wonder flower and Master Hora's advice, Momo and Kassiopeia the tortoise, try to beat the grey men and give the people back their time.<br/><br/><br/>Momo and Kassiopeia must find the way to Master Hora and meet each other at the gate to the never-alley. But how?  Momo has a dream.  She sees a picture that shows the way.  Kassiopeia also has a dream.  It is as if she goes along a dream street and after a long time meets Momo at the gate to the never-alley.<br/><br/>First, the players split into two groups.<br/>One group takes the yellow Momo figure, all the cards with the yellow edges, and one half of the board.<br/>The other group takes the brown Kassiopeia figure, all the cards with brown edges, and the other half of the board.<br/>IMPORTANT:<br/>The two groups don't play against each other but with one another.  Each group respects the other and doesn&rsquo;t make things too difficult or too easy.<br/><br/>The start of the game<br/><br/>The two groups sit apart from each other so that they cannot see the other half of the board, preferably on two separate tables.<br/><br/>Each group sorts their cards.  The green cards and the grey cards are separated. At first, only the green cards are used, as well as the Gigi and Beppo cards.<br/><br/>Each Group now lays a selected card, with a dream picture showing,  on a space on the board.  But not on one of the three approaches to the never-alley.  This card is the start square.  Momo and Kassiopeia are placed here on their respective boards.<br/><br/>For the first game, the path should not be more than ten cards long.  See the illustration.<br/><br/>The storytelling begins<br/><br/>In turn, each group tells the other a story, involving the dream pictures on the chosen path.  For each question mark on the path, the group thinks up their own imaginary picture.<br/>The other group listens carefully and tries to remember the story.<br/><br/>After the two stories have been told, the grey cards are placed on the empty squares of the board (colored pictures face up). The whole board is now full of dream pictures and question marks, and the original path is no longer clear.<br/><br/>The two groups come together and put the two halves of the board together.  Each group now positions itself by the other half of the board and will soon move the figure which goes with that half.<br/><br/>Momo and Kassiopeia run through the city<br/><br/>At last Momo and Kassiopeia set off.  Each group moves their figure in turn onto an adjacent space.  It is important that all the players should participate by recalling the story they heard and they should all agree which space the figure should move to.<br/>Before either Momo or Kassiopeia is placed on a new card, the card is turned over.  If the underside is green the card remains turned and the figure steps onto it.  But if it is grey, the world, once again, becomes a little colder, and an hour flower is taken to the time-store of the grey men.  Master Hora's flower is left until last.<br/>Momo and Kassiopeia may not step on the grey cards.<br/><br/>Gigi and Beppo help Momo and Kassiopeia.  If a group finds one of the friends, this group may expose any chosen card.  In this case, no flower need be given up if the chosen card is grey.<br/><br/>When Momo or Kassiopeia reach the gate to the never-alley,  they wait there for each other and go together to Master Hora.  Master Hora gives them his flower and so Momo and Kassiopeia free all the captured flowers.  The flowers are given back to the people.  Together you have won the game.  If Master Hora has to give up his flower to the grey men no more can be done.  Momo and Kassiopeia, together, have lost the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Miniature wargame rules for Corps level Napoleonic games.<br/><br/>From the TooFatLardies website:<br/><br/>Le Feu Sacre places command and control above musket calibre and march rates. They are aimed at gamers who wish to experience a large scale battle at the battalion level. Players command Corps and Divisions, and maneuver by brigade, regiment or battalion. Avoiding the usual omnipresent control that players are so often allowed over the minutiae of battle, Le Feu Sacr&eacute; concentrates on encouraging historically correct grand tactics. Also included are historical orders of battle for 8 example Corps d'Armee.<br/><br/>The rules use the familiar TooFatLardies card driven system. The Lardies' emphasis on battlefield &quot;friction&quot; allows the better, bolder generals to take the initiative, and recover from unexpected reverses, whilst less competent, cautious commanders need to stick to predictable battle plans, or risk coming unstuck. We present to you a set of rules where Austrian troops can be the equal of the French, but the Empire can still repeat history! Vive l'Empereur!<br/><br/>",

With a hand of 10 cards, players try to score the most points per round by constructing the longest, grammatically correct, and sensible sentence. Each card used in a sentence is worth 5 points, but using some of the more difficult conjugations on the card can earn you bonus points. Any player can object to another players sentence, on either grammatical grounds, or the fact that the sentence just doesn&rsquo;t make sense. The defending player and the objecting player get to argue their points to the rest of the players, who form a jury. The jury gets to vote on whether or not the sentence is acceptable. Half the fun is trying to defend, explain, and justify a completely ridiculous sentence to the other players. Accepted sentences score points, rejected sentences get you zip.

One hell of an understatement, but it was nothing compared to what came next. Zombies. Sure, laugh it up. It&rsquo;s easy to do when you are surrounded by your friends and not by a horde of putrid cadavers breathing rot down your neck.<br/><br/>If it had just been zombies we would have been fine. What is dead once can be made dead again; but these were puppets of evil humans, or rather, necromancers. They were using found magic to reanimate the thousands fallen during the war. Rumors spread that they had gotten a copy of the true Necronomicon but those were only rumors because we have the only real copy. Now we are fleeing for our lives with it in a battered school bus trying to incant the one spell that will send these blighted things back to whence they came. Our team is ragtag but our vehicles are fast. Hopefully they are fast enough to outrun the necromancers riding double on bikes: that&rsquo;s right, they taught the damned things to ride Harleys.&quot;<br/><br/>Voting for the contest this game is in can be done:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/439899\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/439899</a><br/><br/>",

These markers are used to designate mills, farmers, villagers and merchants in the game<br/><br/>Play: Each game round has 3 phases:<br/><br/>Phase 1 - Role Choice<br/>Beginning with the start player, each player places their role pawn on one of the 5 double-sided Role cards, claiming 1 of the 2 roles on the card. Players can place pawns only on Role cards that do not have a pawn already on them.<br/><br/>Phase 2 - Polder Drainage<br/>Beginning with the start player, each player, in turn, clockwise from the start player, may do only one of the following actions:<br/>a. Place a new Polder card and Mill marker in their holding<br/>b. Drain all Polders one level<br/><br/>Phase 3 - Development<br/>Players place markers and score any victory points at this time, per role actions. Players may only place one type of settlement (Farm, Village or City) tile on any one Polder card. Players may never place a settlement tile on a card already developed as a Grist Mill. Prestige Buildings may be claimed by players who have chosen the Banker, Mayor and Merchant roles during this round.<br/><br/>Certain Prestige Buildings, once claimed by a player, give additional bonuses to role actions:<br/><br/>Armory: The player may place one additional merchant when choosing the Merchant role. May be to a different city.<br/>Bookshop: The player may move one additional farmer to either a village or city when choosing the Scholar role. May be from a different farm.<br/>City Gate: The player may place one additional villager when choosing the Villager role. May be in a different village.<br/>Church: The player may move one additional merchant to a village or villager to a city when claiming the Clergyman role.

        "description": "Spice is a short game for two players. Spice is a very simple adaptation of Ketchup for play with the Series: Shibumi game system.<br/><br/>In Spice, the goal is to have the largest group of stones when the game is complete. A group is defined as stones that are &quot;touching&quot;, either orthogonally or one on top of the other. The game is over when all the spaces on the gameboard have been filled.<br/><br/>Players play with either RED (ketchup) or BLACK (pepper) stones, and the game begins with a small WHITE 5-stone 2x2 pyramid in the center of the gameboard. The white stones cannot be removed and are neutral, they do not count toward either player's groups of stones.<br/><br/>On the first turn of the game, Ketchup must place 1 RED stone in any empty space. On subsequent turns, players put 1 or 2 stones of their color in any empty space on the board.<br/><br/>If the largest group of stones on the board after your turn is larger than the largest group of stones (of either color) before your turn, then your opponent may remove one of your &quot;free&quot; stones on their next turn (and only on their next turn).<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when the board is full, but the top stone is removed before scoring.<br/><br/>Included in the Shibumi Rule Book<br/><br/>Soft cover:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...</a><br/><br/>Downloadable PDF:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game Description<br/><br/>Zombie Enclave (ZE) is a free, solitaire game of survival on a Earth dominated by Zombies: while designed as a solitaire game you can easily play ZE with two (multiplayer rules are included).<br/><br/>The focus of the game is the Refuge (the Enclave in the game title), the place where you're trying to defend yourself from the zombie attacks, accumulating enough resources in order to gain some additional weeks of life.<br/><br/>You start the game with a very simple, undefended Refuge and then you will have to plan how to protect your Survivors by adding the many &quot;defenses&quot; available. &quot;Defenses&quot; can be holes, wall reinforcements, explosive barrels, traps and so on: the idea is to replicate the full spectrum of iconic scenes seen in the zombie movies. The game sequence can then be summarized as: gain new resources, spend resources to improve your Refuge, wait for the enemy attack.<br/><br/>Zombies will be managed with a &quot;buildup pool&quot;: every turn you draw a buildup chit and apply the results (normally new zombies arriving) while an &quot;Attack!&quot; marker will initiate the combat.<br/><br/>During combat the zombies will move from the upper part of the map (the external defenses) toward your Refuge: the Defenses will try to slow and/or damage the zombies but it's up to the Survivors to close the fight.<br/><br/>In terms of rules, the game will include a set of Standard Rules, with basic tasks and a good set of available resources to start with. Several scenarios will make possible a quick start of the game with not only your Refuge, but also an external defensive wall and a bunch of resource points that you can spend during setup to prepare your initial defenses.<br/><br/>Advanced rules will add more details (like Vehicles and Events), and finally the Campaign game will make possible to start really from zero, with just you and Soldier, your invaluable dog.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The battle of Bannockburn in 1314 defended the Scottish nation and was a major milestone on the path to the independence. The  Scottish highlanders slaughtered the mighty English army that included more than 2000 knights and 15000 infantrymen.<br/><br/>The game allows to play the battle of Bannockburn as well as two predecessors: battle of Stirling (1297) and battle of Falkirk (1298). Players are given the command over English heavy cavalry or Scottish shiltrons and their goal is to eliminate units and leaders of the opponent and/or secure strategic targets of the army.<br/><br/>This is a typical hex and counter game. Initiative is determined in each scenario and kept for the entire game. Players perform their actions in order, with possible reactions (when enemy units enter missile range).<br/><br/>Example:<br/>1. Player A moves cavalry (reaction fire possible)<br/>2. Cavalry of player A attacks<br/>3. Player A moves infantry (reaction fire possible)<br/>4. Infantry of player A attacks<br/>5. Player B moves cavalry etc.<br/><br/>Movement is determined by the terrain and the unit type. The battles are determined by comparing unit strength, which is modified by various factors (armor, charge, terrain, leaders etc.), and dice roll. Some interesting elements of game mechanics include  fatigue of units, morale and cavalry movement (turning requires more space).<br/><br/>The game includes: three paper maps (2 made of two parts that should be duct-taped together or glued, on a single part), chits with units (punchable) and additional chits (for marking &quot;charge&quot;, &quot;fatigue&quot; modifiers) that need to be cut out.<br/><br/>This game uses the &quot;Medieval&quot; system of &quot;Taktyka i Strategia&quot;, implemented also in Grunwald 1410 - revised and updated. Therefore it can be used with other games from the series. <br/>An english translation of the rules with scenario and examples is provided within the game.<br/><br/><br/>A number of scenarios for this game was published in Taktyka i Strategia magazine:<br/>- Pięść Szkocji (No. 39)<br/>- Falkirk Stream (No. 38)<br/>- Falkirk Otimus (No. 37)<br/>- Szarża Gloucastera (No. 20)<br/>- Walna Bitwa (No. 20)<br/>- Strumień Bannock (No. 19)<br/>- Niebieska Linia (No 19)<br/>- Stirling Maximus (No. 16)<br/>- Kr&oacute;lewskie Polowanie (No. 16)<br/>- Waleczne Serca (No. 15)<br/><br/>",

Some are here to destroy the dungeon, some to take that great power. You are one of these heroes. By your king's order, you must defeat all other heroes and monopolize this dungeon.<br/><br/>The dungeon will help you summon powerful creatures, but you need an altar to do this &mdash; and if you lose your altars, you can hardly survive this battle. By the same token, you can dominate this dungeon by conquering your enemies' altars. You can also collect victory points by destroying the enemies themselves. Making the most powerful army is one way to win. Now it's time to begin the battle!<br/><br/>GSBM (Great Strategy of Battle Monsters) is a fantasy-based strategy game that gives you extreme freedom to maximize your strategic choices and control the game. Each player forms an army of monsters to compete with other players in phases such as Produce, Summon, Move, Battle, and Conquer; each monster has its own unique skill, allowing you to devise clever strategies by combining it with other skills or tactic cards. Players must manage their resources, action points and five mana elements: water, fire, air, earth, and ether. Using these resources effectively is the key to victory. Players must also use field effects, elemental superiority, unit type differences (infantry/archer/cavalry/flyer), joint attacks, and joint defense to their advantage.<br/><br/>The game offers several victory conditions, so each player can take strategic approaches to different victories based on how the game plays out. The game field is randomized for each new game, altering territorial dynamics between players and providing near-infinite start settings. As players become more skilled with the game, their tactics and strategy develop, allowing them to play against others with more unique and original play styles.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>GSBM은 판타지 세계관을 배경으로 한 2~8인용 전략 게임으로서 최대한의 자유도 및 무한한 확장성을 바탕으로, 게이머의 게임 지배력과 전략적 선택가능성을 극대화한 작품입니다. 핸드와 필드 관리, 마나 관리, 승점 관리, 소환 거점 관리 등의 여러 요소가 게임에 녹아 있습니다. 이들을 균형있게 유지해야만 마법진에서  승리의 영광을 눌리 수 있을 것입니다.<br/><br/>",

A powerful government hierarchy wrestled with outlaws and criminal gangs that refused to be quashed. The law was unrelenting and the streets were heavily policed.&quot;<br/><br/>Will your team survive this cyberpunk adventure? Chasing Eden is driven by its simple storytelling and evocative artwork set during the founding of the Time Agency. Good luck solving this mystery, and please send through any feedback you might have!<br/><br/>EDIT: Thanks to all who have played the game and left their feedback!<br/><br/>For those interested, I should have given some greater detail in the original upload. A large part of the inspiration was the movie &quot;Edge of Tomorrow&quot;, where the character is forced to repeat the same day (learning something new each time) until he finds the path forward. Admittedly, when I've played other Time Stories scenarios my aim has always been to finish while hopefully not having to repeat the mission, but that is largely because Bob is so cranky :P<br/><br/>I wanted my story to have things that you need to pay attention to on the first run (e.g. how to make money, how to save/gain time, how to become badass enough to win the boss-fight, and what receptacle characters are integral to the story). And for the keen of eye, there are various clues around for the various &quot;vital&quot; decisions. The scenario only has a couple of smaller &quot;puzzles&quot; - the greatest puzzle I wanted to make was the actual progression of the story!<br/><br/>",

A team consists of three riders. The basic game can be played with 2 to 4 players. The duration of a one stage game with 4 players is 1 to 1.5 hours.<br/>. The results of your team and players standings are recorded. A Tour consists of several stages, with the fastest rider over several stages wearing the yellow jersey. You decide for how long and which stages you want to play.<br/>The game is played with cards. By placing a card on the table you decide how fast you are moving your riders on the trail. You try taking tactical moves and benefit from wind advantage by letting your opponent do the hard work. Cast or save your good cards to d&eacute;marrage when you feel that your opponent cannot. In short: &ldquo;Linkeballen&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Note:<br/>If you have the additions as well, you can play up to 24 players.<br/><br/>",

Each player has three discs, with each disc having two of the RPS symbols on opposite sides, i.e., rock-paper, paper-scissors, and scissors-rock.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he advances one of his discs, flipping it in the process; occupied RPS spaces are jumped over when moving. When a disc lands on one of the RPS spaces, the symbol on the disc is compared to that of the space. If the disc beats the space (according to standard RPS rules), the disc advances another space, flipping once again. If the symbols are the same, the disc ends its movement on that space, and if the disc loses, it slides back one space without being flipped. On a &quot;VS&quot; space, the disc ends its movement if the space is vacant and advances if one of its own pieces is on the space; if the space is occupied by an opponent, though, the two players compete in an actual RPS game, with the active player moving forward if he wins and ending his turn otherwise.<br/><br/>Players are trying to land their discs in the final section of the track, which is worth bonus points based on how far the disc advances. Additional spaces along the track bear positive or negative points based on that game's set-up. The game ends once a disc reaches the final space on the track. Players then tally their scores, with discs on the starting spaces losing points. Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

(&quot;Peanut&quot; in German is &quot;Erdnuss&quot;.)<br/><br/>The game plays as traditional Bohnanza, with players trading cards and planting beans in fields in order to score points. While normally each type of bean must stand on its own in a field, the peanut card can be played on any other type of bean. If a field is harvested with a peanut on top of it, the entire field is worthless (as the peanut thief has been caught in the act). If, however, the peanut is buried between two other beans in that field, then the field is worth one more taler than normal.<br/><br/>AMIGO notes that it produced 10,000 copies of this special edition.<br/><br/>",

Lee lead the Army of Northern Virginia deep into Union territory in hopes of capturing vital northern supply cities and forcing an early end to the American Civil War. The Union army, finding itself in the middle of yet another high level reorganization and command change after the debacle at Chancellorsville, was slow to respond. What followed was the largest and most important single battle of the war, and in American history.<br/><br/>But things could have been different. Find out how in this exciting new game from Deer Valley Game Company. Not another re-make of the Battle of Gettysburg; this game re-creates the entire Gettysburg Campaign - Lee's 1863 Summer Offensive. Now you are in charge!<br/><br/>This operational level game uses the block unit system to re-create the limited intelligance of the actual campaign. Players maneuver their forces without adequate knowledge of their opponents strengths or even location. The game board portrays the eastern part of the country, from southern Pennsylvania to northern Virginia, with a point to point movement system on a 30 x 22 playing map. Limited command abilities and critical supply wagons are key to managing your armies and achieving victory.<br/><br/>",

To secure victory in this contest, they must utilize all their resources and seek assistance whenever possible.<br/><br/>However, this journey will not be without obstacles, as remnants of the old regime still lurk in the shadows, plotting an uprising.<br/><br/>The core game loop of The Queen's New Capital is quite simple: Players draw six cards and play four cards each round. These action cards enable players to construct structures (the primary source of points in the game), recruit leaders with passive abilities, acquire more powerful action cards, and contribute to the kingdom's Political and Warfare crises.<br/><br/>The winner will be the first player to obtain eight Recognition Seals, which are bestowed upon reaching five points in each of the four Province Status tracks: Might, Morale, Influence, and Wealth.<br/><br/>The Queen's New Capital is a strategic game that immerses players in the difficult decisions faced by leaders when overseeing a community's ascent. Going all-in on dazzling new infrastructure may attract thieves and political dissidents, while dedicating all resources to safeguarding the frontiers can impede innovation and development. Striking a balance and establishing a swift engine is the key to achieving victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Partner up with a keen and clever horse. A variety of challenging jumps await. The exciting Perfect Stride horse game starts now! You and up to three competitors play skilled riders. Be ready for the unexpected -- sometimes lucky events occur and sometimes trouble comes your way. Collect the most ribbons to win the game!&quot;<br/><br/>The jump course, made up of up to 10 jumps or obstacles is determined by randomly placing (face down) up to 10 Jump cards in a row.  The game contains a total of 20 Jump so chances are, your course will be different every time you play.<br/><br/>In Perfect Stride, game play occurs in two phases.<br/>During the &quot;Set the Pace&quot; phase, all players secretly choose the speed at which they move their horse and simultaneously reveal that speed.  This determines the order in which the players will attempt the upcoming jump and how many Skill cards they are allowed to draw.  Skill cards will be used during the &quot;Jump&quot; phase to successfully clear the newly revealed jump ahead.  Rider Jump Order may also affect the outcome of other events which will occur.  The rider in the lead receives the Lead Rider Token and jumps first and can gain bonus points for keeping the lead BUT the faster you ride, the fewer Skill cards you draw.  The lead rider also reveals the next jump during the next game phase.<br/><br/>Players then draw their Skill cards and the Jump Phase begins.  Each rider in Rider Jump Order, makes an attempt to successfully clear the jump ahead by playing skill cards and activating special card functions.  In addition, unknown events will occur (from the Event card deck) which will affect a riders attempt.  Those that successfully clear the jump win Ribbon Points.  The order in which riders clear the jump determines how many ribbon points they win.  The Lead Rider Token may change hands many times during the Jump phase and the rider who is in the lead at the end of the Jump phase will gain bonus ribbons.<br/><br/>Perfect Stride is a game with many levels of strategy with just the right amount of luck blended in.  How fast should I ride?  Who is in the lead?  Should I sacrifice my draw to get ahead of other Riders?  Should I save specific Skill cards to use later on?  When should I take the lead from another rider?  Perfect Stride is a game you will want to play again and again.<br/><br/>Included in the game is a beautifully illustrated 95-card deck, 54 Ribbon Point Cards, 16 Pace Cards, a Lead Rider token and Rulebook.<br/><br/>",

The Basic Version is a normal board game while the Active version requires real life skills, such as being required to hold your breath while playing through a Nightmare about drowning. The Basic version provides 12 different nightmare scenes each with their own simple special rule based on the theme of the scene. Most plays will take the player through one to five of these scenes. The Active version replaces or changes 8 of the scenes for a total of 20 different nightmare scenes.<br/><br/>Endless Nightmare is an entry in the 2013 Solitaire Print and Play Contest, where it placed second in the No Assembly Required category and won its designer the Best New Designer category.<br/><br/>Endless Nightmare is free to print and play, and a single sheet of paper needs to be printed. Add in 11 small markers (one of which must be different than the others) and a six sided die. To play the Active Version another sheet of paper must be printed and 6 more markers and a stop watch (one is available on most phones) are needed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A different dice game. No lucky dice here, as they are used as tokens in this game. The special thing about the game is, that in order to move the dice forward, they are tilted over their edges. There are two game variants: In the first variant, a player&rsquo;s dice must reach the opposite end of the board first. If two dice of the opposing players are colliding, the dice showing the lower number has to be removed from the board. The second game variant resembles Halma but is more demanding. Players can hop their dice over any other dice in a straight line attempting to get as many of their own dice as possible to the opposite baseline of the board. The game ends if one player manages to completely occupy the other player&rsquo;s baseline. However, the player who first manages to do so, needn&rsquo;t be the winner of the game! The winner is determined by adding up each player&rsquo;s eye number of dice already on the opposite baseline. Though players will need to make some minor tactical considerations during play, CUBLINO is definitely a great fun to play game. It is a family game for adults and children of 5 years and older. CUBLINO&rsquo;s elaborate design features slots for the dice and optimized edges for a smooth gaming experience<br/>(From the website of Intellego)<br/><br/>",

Players take turns adding pieces from their supply to the chain of played pieces, either by placing dominoes or by creating a &quot;pyrino&quot; out of pyramids.  When one person runs out of pieces, the round ends, and the winner scores points.  Subsequent rounds are played until one player has earned 100 points.

There are up to 3 rounds for each word, and the earlier the round, the more points that are awarded to the clue givers and correct guessers. The more people that guess the correct Proclaim! word, the fewer points that are awarded to each person, so clues must be clever enough to lead players to different possible answers to maximize their score. Creative, tricky ambiguity is the key to the game. Both the clue giver and guessing players have additional opportunities for extra points. For example, if a guessing player is certain they know the Proclaim! word, they yell &ldquo;Proclaim!&rdquo;, and roll the dice to determine the number of points to move forward for a correct guess, or backward for an incorrect guess. Also, the clue giver earns a &quot;unique&quot; bonus if the guessing players each give a different answer.  Play continues until the first player has successfully advanced to the finish space on the Proclaim! board.<br/><br/>",

Visit the Dubonnet Club with its mysterious spinning room and the Mallory Gallery where the &quot;Baseball Diamond&quot; is hidden. To enter the Gallery, you must make a precarious climb up the side of the Gallery Building. Then before you can save the jewel, you must be sure you own four different Thief cards.

        "description": "Arsenal: Arena Combat is a 2-6 player customizable card game that uses a hex-map game board, tokens or miniature mechs, counters and 6-sided dice to facilitate play.<br/><br/>In Arsenal, you take on the role of a pilot in a combat mech arena. This arena is represented by a small hex map (the gameboard). You move your Mech around on this map to gain an advantage against your opponent, and then play cards from your hand to attack or defend. You will manage your power levels (the resource used to play cards), and use all manner of tactics to win out against your opponent.<br/><br/>To play Arsenal, each player first chooses a Mech, then they each build a deck from the cards available to that Mech (not all Mechs are created equal). Next you and your opponent(s) shuffle your decks, grab 8 energy cards, a handful of 6-sided dice and damage counters, and put a token on the board that matches your Mech. Then you figure out who's going first and start playing!<br/><br/>- Players take turns moving their Mech around the arena, and playing cards from their hand to represent things like lock-ons, deployable objects, or any number of actions and reactions.<br/>- On your turn, you play attack cards from your hand that represent both your weapons and your ammunition, provided your target is within the attack's effective range.<br/>- When an attack is played, all players have a chance to react to it, by playing their own cards that represent things like taking evasive maneuvers or bracing for impact.<br/>- After everyone has had a chance to react, the attack is resolved: the attacker and defender both roll a number of dice determined by the attack card, range, and other variables. Both players then add up the number of 1's and 6's they rolled.<br/>- The defender must meet or beat the attacker's roll in order to dodge the attack. If they don't, it hits, and their Mech takes damage! Continue until only one Mech (or team) is left standing.<br/><br/>All cards have an energy cost. You have 8 energy to spend on every player's turn, but you also have the option to &quot;burn&quot; any or all of your 8 energy. Doing so could pay off big, but &quot;burned&quot; energy comes back at a much slower rate, leaving you open to counter attack.<br/><br/>",

The discovery of a crashed alien spacecraft in the Antarctic has led to the development of revolutionary combat walkers that surpass the most advanced tank technology. Old alliances have fragmented and new ones arisen as three major blocs, the Allies, the Axis and the Sino-Soviet Union (SSU) fight the world over for VK, a valuable new resource that power their new fighting machines.<br/><br/>Dust Tactics is a miniatures board game for 2 or more players. The Allied Taskforce Joe starter set contains everything you need to start playing Dust Tactics, including 10 highly-detailed plastic miniatures, unit cards, terrain elements, special Dust dice, and the Dust rulebook. Enter the world of Dust and lead your Allied Taskforce into battle against Axis or SSU Battlegroups.<br/><br/>Note: The rules and cards in this box are based on the version 2 rules, but are slightly different from and not completely compatible with the full Dust Tactics version 2 rulebook.<br/><br/>",

Player 1 then begins the game by turning up 2 cards in place. If these cards share a feature, he can either end his turn and score these, or keep going by turning up another card. If all 3 cards share a feature, once again, he can either end his turn and score these, or keep going, and so on.<br/><br/>The more bugs a player collects in a single turn, the more points he will get. But if at any point the cards he has turned up don&rsquo;t all share a feature, he must turn them back over and won&rsquo;t score any points at all.<br/><br/>Players continue taking turns until the grid can no longer be refilled to 20 cards, whereupon the game is over, and the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to navigate through the prison in an attempt to gain three resources (blueprint, keycard, too) and then head to the room identified on your blueprint to escape.<br/><br/>But this prison will be unforgiving.  With every turn you will have to contend with gang attacks, fellow inmates trying to escape, and officers looking to send you to solitary confinement.<br/><br/>Jail Break is dynamic because you draw a unique mugshot profile, that provides you with a special skill set to use throughout the match in every match.  The prison layout will also change with every session (as it is made up from cards) creating a different game each time you play.<br/><br/>",

Eliminate the opposing cups first to win.<br/><br/>Players each have a character card granting unique powers, and a deck they customize ahead of time from a large set of options.  10 cards in the deck are special powers and 10 are mana cards that trigger your character's special powers.  There are also rules for team variants, and some options to play with a random deck if you don't want to customize a deck for yourself.<br/><br/>The game openly suggests that you play it as a drinking game with alcohol, and players must drink from their HP cups as they are eliminated.  One of the character cards has the special power to be the designated driver and never drinks (along with some other special powers too).<br/><br/>Description from the box:<br/><br/>Dungeon Cup is a game that takes the beloved game of Beer Pong and enhances it with a touch of fantasy, roleplaying, strategic card play, team work, and let's not forget, alcohol!<br/><br/>This is a drinking game for 2-4 players.  Don't worry though, we have a character for designated drivers too!  Seasoned veterans of Beer Pong, Card Game Masters, or Simple Peasants, will all be equals on this battlefield.  Some players will win with sheer skills, others a lucky card.  Then there are the players with a really high drinking tolerance...  So pick a character, and build a deck of cards that suits your play style, or let fate pick your cards for you!<br/><br/>",

Lay the 17 wooden bits in a circle around the cards, then place the arrow next to a bit to create a starting point in the line. Each player takes a set of cards numbered 1-6.<br/><br/>The first player takes the first six bits in line, along with the building platform and sunglasses, then shuffles their deck and secretly looks at the bottommost card. They now have 30 seconds to use the wooden bits to recreate the image on the associated construction card, balancing bits as they wish, but not moving them to create an animated scene.<br/><br/>The other players can each play one card face down into the central hexagon to guess which construction card the active player is building. Once time runs out or everyone has guessed, the active player forecasts how many others correctly guessed the answer, then reveals all the cards. Whoever first guessed the correct answer scores 2 points, with the second correct guesser earning 1 point. If at least one person guessed correctly, the builder scores 1 point, and if they forecast correctly, they score a bonus 1 point.<br/><br/>The builder then places all used bits at the end of the line and passes unused bits to the next player clockwise, with that player taking bits from the line as needed to have six on hand.<br/><br/>After everyone has been builder twice (with 5-6 players) or thrice (with 3-4 players), whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Then the Voles created their civilization and fiddled with the smaller things of the Earth until the Voles ended as well. Now the tiny creatures of the forest compete to find the artifacts and knowledge left by the fallen empires so that they too can mess it all up in their turn.<br/><br/>Each game of Vasty Wilds begins with a randomly placed network of Root cards. The players add cards to the board to expand the forest. Each card placement includes movement and other beneficial effects (Progress) for the player and detrimental effects (Misfortune) for her opponents. A player's opponents are in charge of placing her objectives in inconvenient places on the board. The player who collects all of her objectives first wins.<br/><br/>While Vasty Wilds is easy to learn for younger players or beginners, successive plays will reveal more complex strategies for card placement and effect combinations.<br/><br/>",

Cavalry charges and infantry shock attacks are given special consideration.<br/><br/>The game is won by killing either Richard III or Henry Tudor or by routing your opponents army. If neither of these objectives have been achieved after 8 turns, the Yorkist side wins.<br/><br/>",

They utilise all manner of gadgets, devices and traps to influence the flow and direction of the game. From a distance, the Engineers players move as one giant machine, perfectly in sync with each other...<br/><br/>Resilient in combat, accurate with the ball, the Engineers have a solid play style. Whilst not as mobile as some teams, they are able to move the ball great distances and accurately too. They excel in the mid-game, once all the pieces are in place they can control the pitch while pinging the ball around their opponent.<br/><br/>In the Engineer's Guild you witness first-hand the evolution of Guild Ball. Bringing a whole new definition to &quot;technical play,&quot; the Engineers are not afraid to push the boundaries, using new mechanica to give them the edge on the pitch. Some consider the ranged weaponry of the Guild to be an affront to the grand traditions of the game; other more knowledgeable observers realize they bear witness to the future of Guild Ball.<br/><br/>Mastering the Engineers is an exercise in synergy; comfortable on the ball, they are the consummate masters of possession play. Opponents will find themselves held at arms' length; trying to pick their way through Ballista's deadly minefield and Salvo's rain of crossbow bolts just to watch Velocity accelerate away with the precision and power only a machine can achieve.<br/><br/>This set provides you with all you need to start playing the Engineer's Guild.<br/><br/>",

Then players guess which card their partner chose. Unchosen cards are discarded and replaced, and a secret selection happens again.

Opportunism, interaction and anticipation make the pleasure of a game that suddenly makes one of the greatest French writers of all time very close.<br/><br/>In the game Voyages avec Montaigne, players place cards face up next to the last card they placed, on a line from left to right. This line represents their journey.<br/><br/>On their turn, players take turns with 1 action among 3 : <br/><br/>     Travel : place a card from a different city AND pay the cost of the travel (0, 1 or 2 cards discarded)<br/>     Stay : placing a card of the same city AND pick 1 new card<br/>     Get supplies : not placing a card AND pick  and 2 new cards<br/><br/><br/>Players can discard a figure met during his journey to take another action OR take a card from the discard pile.<br/><br/>2 travelling rules must be respected :<br/><br/>     At the end of their journey, players must return to Bordeaux and have placed at least on &laquo; Citation &raquo; card form each of the 3 books of Montaigne<br/>     Players cannot go back to a city they have already been.<br/><br/><br/>During their journey, players take one of the Bonus tile available as soon as they reach the objective first or do better than a player who had already achieved the objective (5 discovery bonus, 4 book bonus).<br/><br/>When the &laquo; King&rsquo;s call &raquo; special card is revealed, all players must go back to Bordeaux as soon as possible, rules are thus modified :<br/><br/>     Action &laquo; Stay &raquo; is not allowed anymore<br/>     Players cannot travel to a city that would take them further away from Bordeaux.<br/><br/><br/>First players returning to Bordeaux get bonus, As soon as all players but one have returned to Bordeaux, the last player only has one turn left to play.<br/><br/>Bonus tiles are awarded to players : most cities visited, the most different theme cards, the most different characters encountered, largest stay.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The premise of the game is that the Cuban &ldquo;missile crisis&rdquo; escalated to an all-out nuclear war between the Cold War protagonists. The game is designed for two players, one taking on the role of the attacking US forces and the other the defending air defense forces of the Soviet Union. The game can also be played solitaire. The SAC game's design is based on the classic NORAD game, published over four decades ago by Conflict Magazine and Simulations, and designed by Dana Lombardy. My design is a tribute to that classic, but with the gaming perspective &quot;switched&quot; and some new rules &quot;tweaks&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

It might even be better than its more famous related games!<br/><br/>In East-West, each player draws a card from a short deck and commits it to one of three shared central cards in an attempt to build better poker hands to win three contested spots. Variant rules improve the game by adding a doubling cube, cards in hand, a full deck and five contested areas instead of three.<br/><br/>The basic game is played with a 32 card deck (7 to Ace in four suits) with three active areas in which players build competing poker hands (using one shared card in each of the areas). A player wins the game if they win at least two of the three hands. Alternately, the game can be played to any point total one wishes. At the end of each game, a player would win 1 point for winning with two of the three hands, or 2 points for winning all three hands. The winner is the first to reach the agreed-upon points total.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>Played with a standard deck of cards, published in Reiner Knizia's book Blazing Aces!: A Fistful of Family Card Games.<br/><br/>",

After doing this, the player either adds those cards to hand or places them face-up in their own personal supply. The player can then add any number of cards from their personal supply to their hand.<br/><br/>If the player can then make a bouquet of all the cards in hand and their cards contain at least five flowers, they can score if they wish. The cards must show all the same flower, or all types of flowers must be represented in equal numbers (e.g., three lilies and three roses), or at least three types of flowers in ascending numerical order (e.g., one daisy, two roses and three lilies). If the player hands in nine or more flowers, they gain bonus points in addition to one point for each flower.<br/><br/>When the market runs out, players score a final bouquet, then lose points for cards left in hand.

Note, however, that there are only 4 pieces per player instead of the almost-standard 5 (historically, the number of pieces per player varied between 5 and 10), so a fifth piece would ideally need to be supplied.<br/>H. A. Renz chose, once more, to use the components for an entirely different, modern abstract strategy game.  Each player uses two special dice to move both his pieces and his adversary's (this is the only game of the triad to have a random element).  The object of the game is to either &quot;push&quot; all adversary pieces into the water (a special square), occupy the &quot;happiness&quot; square with one's last remaining piece, or box the adversary in so he cannot move.<br/>Note how driving towards one victory condition (by adversary elimination) actually opens up a victory opportunity for the adversary --a neat twist.<br/>Remarkably, the starting position is asymmetric because the board is asymmetric.  There does not seem to be much of an advantage or handicap to being one side or the other.<br/><br/>",

As with other games in the series, it uses a combat system that emphasizes weapon/armor superiority and maneuverability over quantity.<br/><br/>According to designer Mark Herman, &quot;Hoplite warfare is a rather stolid affair. In most battles it's a question of whether Phalanx &quot;a&quot; can outpush and outsnarl Phalanx &quot;b&quot;. This, for the most part, is why we chose not to begin our Great Battles of History series with something like HOPLITE: Classical Greek Warfare. With only a few exceptions, the scenario pickings alternate between dreary and grim. Marathon, one of the pivotal battles in classical history, is one of those exceptions.&quot; Marathon features the first bloody meeting between the great Persian Empire and the emerging power of Athens. The Persian army utilized light infantry and light cavalry from across their cosmopolitan empire. The Athenians used the famed Greek hoplites.<br/><br/>",

Alternative scoring rules allow the simulation of a tour (de France) along more numerous stages.<br/><br/>Like Homas Tour, there are alternative routes to pick from (in this case a fast oval, a longer road-race, and an even longer mountain stage) and there are different road surfaces to deal with. But although movement is also a combination of dice rolling, demarrages and  slipstreaming, the mechanism used to resolve dice movement is very different from the usual roll-and-move. A player rolls 4 dice after obligatory slipstreaming, and the highest amount of team members that form a queue determine how many of these dice can be allocated to riders. Only the lowest numbers can be allocated, and you have to move the highest amount of riders that the dice will allow, making sequential positioning a crucial part of the game.<br/><br/>The &quot;deluxe&quot; edition of this game came in a clear plastic tube with magnetic chits representing riders and a 3 color board printed on a ferro-foil mat.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;I would fight them if they were a million.&rdquo; - Albert Sidney Johnston on the eve of Shiloh<br/><br/>&ldquo;Take your damned regiment back to Ohio. There are no Confederates closer than Corinth.&rdquo; - William Tecumseh Sherman to Jesse Appler of the 53rd Ohio, April 5<br/><br/>On April 5, 1862 the Confederacy appeared to be finished. Forts Henry and Donelson had fallen and a Confederate division had been routed at Mill Springs. The Rebels had lost Columbus, Clarksville, and Nashville. New Orleans and Memphis were under direct threat. Out west the invasion of New Mexico had failed and the Union had triumphed at Pea Ridge. Forts and ports along the seaboard were being captured or raided. In Virginia, George McClellan had at last started his great drive to capture Richmond. On the banks of the Tennessee River a complacent Union army rested and waited for reinforcements before beginning what some thought would be the final push to end the rebellion.<br/><br/>On the morning of April 6 the Confederates attacked that complacent army near Shiloh Church. For two days the biggest battle yet waged by Americans was fought, a battle as large and savage as anything fought by Napoleon. In the end the Union triumphed, but at heavy cost. Ulysses S. Grant was for a time sidelined and Union generals became cautious for months after. Most of all, Shiloh changed the Civil War. Combined with Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s successful defense of Richmond, Shiloh killed the vain dream of a quick war with conservative ends. The American Civil War became a long contest of wills, ending in the destruction of slavery and economic ruin for the American South.<br/><br/>Rally 'Round the Flag! is a brigade grand tactical system that combines old school hex and counter maneuvers with rules for command and control, leader personalities, and a CRT that favors quality and firepower over raw mass. For Shiloh the series will feature rules for the 47th Tennessee, Lew Wallace&rsquo;s variable arrival, and Union gunboats among other things. The game comes with multiple scenarios, including a better Confederate attack plan, the battle starting on April 5, and the second day of battle. In addition, rules are included to modify each scenario with a variable arrival for Don Carlos Buell&rsquo;s Army of the Ohio and part of the Fort Donelson garrison escaping and taking part in the battle. For those wanted to be even more adventurous, units are included from Earl Van Dorn&rsquo;s Army of the West, and the brigades involved in the siege of Island No. 10.<br/><br/>",

The auction is broken into three simultaneous lots: a mountain area, a river area, and an in-between area (though these are referential only, and not thematic.)<br/><br/>Players program their bids for each of the three areas, by arranging the cards in their hand.  The highest bid for each area will take a card, followed by the next highest bid.<br/><br/>If a player wins food cards or rabbits, these are placed face up in front of a player.  If a player wins a rock card, it is added to their hand.  If a player wins a gold card, it can be discarded or swapped for another card in their hand.<br/><br/>After the auction, the player return the cards they used in the previous round to their hand (allowing for any additions or exchanges from the rock and gold cards), new cards are added to the areas, and the game play repeats.<br/><br/>After 7 rounds, the players compare who has the most in each of the three food types, and golden animal cards are awarded.  Players add the points collected from those to points (both positive and negative) on other cards in their hand, and the player with the most points wins.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>GOLDEN ANIMAL は、世にも珍しい金の動物・GOLDEN ANIMAL を集めて勝利を目指すゲームです。<br/>各プレイヤーは、手札に山カード１枚、川カード１枚。金貨カード複数枚を持っています。そして、自分の手札を好きなように並び替えて全員同時に公開します。山カードと川カードを境に３か所に区切られた各エリアごとに、金貨の合計額で順位を付けて、各ヵ所で競りの商品になっている動物やエサや金貨を獲得していきます。<br/>動物を獲得すると点数を得ることができます。エサを獲得すると獲得した順位によって大量得点を得ることができます。金貨を獲得すると自分の金貨が増えます。最終的に得点の高いプレイヤーの勝利です。<br/>競り・バッティング・拡大再生産をミックスした手軽なパーティゲームです。<br/>publisher's summary<br/><br/>",
