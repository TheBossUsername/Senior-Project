But no clan is safe from the Vikings who battles and plunder.<br/><br/>As a provincial king you lead your own Irish clan, with the ambition of winning the game. You always have to deal with the circumstances unique for each game play and there are several paths to victory: by kingdom building, conquest or economy.<br/><br/>The game flow follows a seasonal calendar, and through the year you explore new territories, gather resources and construct buildings and ships. You may also move your clan units and start battles.<br/><br/>During the fair military units may be recruited and you may trade resources in a challenging and unique dynamic trade system. The numerous development cards give you a possibility to gain a variety of new skills and enhance your military capabilities during the game.<br/><br/>Although the game contains an intriguing battle system, battle between players is downplayed. Focus for the battles is instead the exciting and automated Viking system, which includes both sea raids and ravaging Viking warbands to deal with.<br/><br/>The game is designed for high replayability, where each game session provides a new challenge and experience. 8 different kings can be combined with 4 different clans. The development of the economy, the activities of the Vikings, and alternative development cards are also factors that make each game session unique.<br/><br/>So, will you succeed with your chosen path, take control as the High King and proclaim yourself &lsquo;Emperor of the Gaels&rsquo;?<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Change of Heart is a collection of trick-taking games from designer Chris Wray and artist Megan Russell.  Each game is a twist on the classic game Hearts. Each features an all-new mechanic.<br/><br/>Change of Heart: This is a new spin on the classic game of Hearts.<br/> In Hearts, the Queen of Spades was worth a whopping -13 points. Why put so much emphasis on one card? In Change of Hearts, all of the Queens are worth negative five points.<br/><br/>The idea was also to put a fresh twist on the Jack of Diamonds, which in some Hearts variants was worth +10 points. But again, why so much emphasis on one card? In this game, all of the Jacks are worth something, and worth even more the more you capture.<br/><br/>The high cards in the deck also have different backs, and players pick their hands using the limited amount of information that provides. The first pick goes to the player furthest behind, creating a sort of catch-up mechanic.<br/><br/>Look Ma, No Hands: A frequent knock on trick taking games is the luck factor. This game is, to the designer's knowledge, the first full-information, fully-determinative trick taking game designed. Many of the concepts that make this a no-luck game could work with other trick-taking games, but it felt most natural to marry them with the game of Hearts.<br/><br/>All cards begin on the table. Players play tricks, taking any card from the table, though they should generally follow if they can (there are rules if they don't). The winner of the trick gets positive points.  Everybody takes the card they personally played.<br/><br/>Thus, players in the first phase are building their hands with trick taking. Then they play a second hand, but it is the classic trick avoidance game of Hearts, with the negative points for Queens and Hearts.<br/><br/>In sum, there is full information, and the game very much feels like Hearts. But it has zero luck.<br/><br/>Go Shoot the Moon: The designer's favorite part of the game of Hearts was always trying to &ldquo;shoot the moon.&rdquo; In this game, the theme is to make the game of Hearts where one player attempts to shoot the moon each hand. There's a sort of auction at the start, where players can either take the moon shooters' hand (i.e. the hand with the highest cards; the suit back is different on the highest cards) or pass over it under the agreement that they will pass the moonshooter one of their highest cards.  There is a scoring mechanic for when the moon is not shot.<br/><br/>The Tin Man: The Tin Man has always wanted a heart, and with apologies to L. Frank Baum, the best way to get it is not from finding a wizard from Kansas, but rather by playing the game of Hearts.<br/><br/>This uses a sort of automated player called The Tin Man; he can win tricks. If the Tin Man captures the most Hearts, he will be happy, and the players will be rewarded (i.e. Hearts and Queens will score POSITIVE points). If not, he&rsquo;ll be upset, and the players will suffer (i.e. Hearts and Queens will score NEGATIVE points).<br/><br/>Hearts is the classic &ldquo;trick avoidance&rdquo; game, where players usually avoid capturing tricks, since points are unwanted. But what if the game wasn&rsquo;t necessarily a trick avoidance game, but could become a plain trick game (with positive points) if the players (with a little foresight from the track) caused a paradigm shift?<br/><br/>",

Images of magnificent coasts to be explored and legendary civilizations that rose to power come to mind.<br/><br/>The game series History of the Ancient Seas is the ultimate journey through these exciting times. Build new fleets in your city to explore unknown lands, conquer islands and build a great empire.<br/><br/>In HELLAS, the first instalment in the History of the Ancient Seas game series, you will lead one of the great City States - Athens or Sparta.<br/><br/>Your goal is to become the leading empire in known world. To achieve this, you will need to build armies and fleets to increase your military might, expand trade routes, conquer islands and provinces, develop your military skills, economic efficiency and culture, while always keeping an eye on the wealth, happiness and stability of your people.<br/>    <br/>The game is played in highly interactive micro-impulses. The heart of the game system is the action cycle: The players choose one of the eight possible actions. Actions chosen by a player can&rsquo;t be chosen subsequently by the next player. The number of possible actions is limited each turn.<br/><br/>War or peace: That is your decision! You can expand your empire by leading your people to war! But war is costly and the outcome is uncertain. You can lead your empire to the golden age of civilization by keeping the peace and bringing stability and wealth to your people without following the path of war. Offer terms to aggressive enemies to distract or delay them, but always be prepared to defend your empire.<br/><br/>You will move your 3D wooden playing pieces (representing fleets and legions) across the beautifully illustrated map from the center of the Hellenistic world to the shores of Persia in the east and the sandy beaches of Sicily in the west to expand your trade network and increase your trading status.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each location will represent a game area of two maps where each scenario will be played. Links between these map locations will represent road connections which will regulate how many game formations will be able to transit during each operational turn.<br/><br/>During an Operational turn, both players may move their forces on the Operational map point to point to adjacent locations. This is done simultaneously and hidden from the opposing player. Forces that do not move from their location may improve their defensive positions or regroup.<br/><br/>Battles will occur at each location that contains forces of both opposing players. How the forces arrived on the map will determine how the scenario will be set up. As battles occur, both sides may have reinforcements that can move into battle from adjacent locations. Also, artillery units in adjacent locations may be assigned as Artillery Support, and so act as off-board artillery for the battle.<br/><br/>",

Turning, she paced again in the opposite direction. She could see the deep grooves she had worn in the cracked flagstone floor. How long had she been here, walking back and forth? Two hundred years? Two hundred and fifty?<br/><br/>As she thought about her punishment, her tension rose, making her grind her teeth against her gag. If only she could wear through the Demon hide strap stuffed in her mouth as easily as her feet wore down the floor. The muzzle muted her powers, without it she could easily break out of here.<br/><br/>Those were the terms of her imprisonment. She was stuck here, listening to the others moan and whine, until she could break free. Thinking about the havoc she would cause when she got out. What a pleasure it would be to feel the energy of Neemoss leaping from her fingers once again.<br/><br/>With a slow breath, she calmed her mind. Focus on the power, not on the words. If she could only reach the energy around her without speaking the phrases her demon-god taught her. She stared at her chain&rsquo;s anchors on the walls one more time, another breath and she closed her eyes. The anchors shattered. She stared, wide-eyed for a moment, then she concentrated on each of her fellow captives one by one, their bodies turning to dust and ash.<br/><br/>Her sentence was over! Girtiya allowed herself a moment of triumph as she stared at the heavy wooden door, knowing it was no match for her new magic. But before she could splinter the barrier, it dissolved as a swirling mist swept into the room, sucking her into the Conjunction. It seemed like Girtiya would not be roaming free in Neemoss after all.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One Last Score is a high stakes heist game of strategy and deception. You and your friends play as rival criminals assembling crew members to try and outfox each other and walk away with the most loot.<br/><br/>Picture this, you're a master criminal walking the Las Vegas strip when there's a sudden citywide power outage. There has never been a better time to get your old crew together for ONE LAST SCORE.<br/><br/>However, you're not the only master criminal in the city of sin, so if you want to pull off as many heists as possible, you'll have to be clever.<br/>You'll need to choose your heists wisely, because one wrong move could cost you the game, but playing too carefully can be just as risky. Every game will have you weighing the risks and either celebrating or commiserating once the cards are on the table.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Napoleon was trying re-establish his ascendancy in Germany after his disastrous 1812 Russian campaign; and the Coalition needed to survive the overwhelming numbers of the French forces and entice the Austrians to join their side.<br/><br/>The French forces are large, but are plagued by inexperience&mdash;reflected by many infantry formations with limited abilities&mdash; and a shortage of cavalry. The Coalition army<br/>has extensive cavalry&mdash;-including marauding Cossacks, but is constrained by weak<br/>Russian organization and by a defense stretched too thin by the sprawling French army.<br/><br/>The game not only includes the large game on Bautzen, but also includes three additional smaller games recreating battles at Weissig and Konigswartha in an area just north of Bautzen. All four games will be on seven maps and use over 1100 counters in the La Bataille system&rsquo;s first go at Bautzen.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is Spring 1940, and both the British and the Germans have plans to invade neutral Norway.  The British still have the French on their side, while the German Kriegsmarine will never be larger.  Who will strike first?<br/><br/>Norway 1940 is a ziplock expansion for PQ-17 that adds all the British, French, Polish, and German naval and air units needed to re-fight this tense air-naval battle, including such seldom-seen ships and aircraft as the repair ship HMS Vindictive, German Type II U-boats, Blackburn Skuas and Rocs, and early Ju88 heavy fighters.  Special rules reflect the unique conditions of the campaign, such as Scandinavian neutrality, Norwegian coastal defenses, faulty German torpedoes, shore bombardments, and Allied establishment of a forward naval base (historically in the Lofotens).  And just as in the parent game, secretly determined special conditions offer new opportunities and threats to both sides.  Will the British pre-empt the German invasion?  Will the Germans attempt to break out into the Atlantic with their heavy ships?  Will the Allies elect to stay in Narvik instead of evacuating with the fall of France imminent?  Or will the Germans make a daring attempt to seize Iceland before the Allies can occupy it in force?<br/><br/>Norway 1940 includes three operational scenarios highlighting key periods of the campaign.  Operation WESER&Uuml;BUNG covers early April 1940, with both sides attempting to land ground forces in neutral Norway.  Operation SICKLE covers the second half of the month, as the Allies counter-attack after the successful German invasion.  And Operation JUNO depicts the end of the campaign in early June, when the Germans attempt to interfere with the Allied offensive on Narvik, unaware that the Allies have already decided to evacuate (or have they?).  Plus a 1940 Campaign scenario allows players to refight the entire 10-week campaign, including a semi-abstract system for ground operations that will ultimately decide victory in the game.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    115 1&quot; square counters <br/>    140 1/2&quot; square markers <br/>    26 circular counters in 3 sizes <br/>    Two 8-1/2 x 11&quot; Player Aid Cards <br/>    One 8-1/2 x 11&quot; Campaign Display <br/>    Two 8-1/2 x 5-1/2&quot; Port Displays <br/>    2nd Edition PQ-17 Rules booklet <br/>    Play booklet<br/><br/><br/>",

Or will Jesse spring Luke in time and make their escape? Both men's fates are in your hands...<br/><br/>Outlaws is a free Print &amp; Play fast playing game of gunfights, bank heists and general shenanigans set in the Old West of America. Each character in the game has his own character card with which a player tracks what he holds and carries and any wounds he picks up.<br/><br/>The game can be played in two modes: stand alone scenarios called shootouts, and adventures where several scenarios are linked together into a larger storyline.<br/><br/>The game system is based around an action track system where characters expend actions to perform activities. Wounds are represented by randomly drawn wound counters that may result in anything from a small leg graze to a belly wound that will get worse during the course of the game to a direct head shot that takes out a man immediately.<br/><br/>The initial release of the game is titled; Outlaws: Adventures in the Old West - Episode One. Each episode will  include the base rules which run to 12 pages and include many illustrations on all aspects of play. There is also a Shootout and Adventure booklet containing scenarios.<br/><br/>In Episode One there are 10 maps - each will print on a single US Letter or A4 page and will tile with each other to create a large range of environments in which scenarios are set. Episode one contains all you need to play.<br/><br/>",

Every round each player secretly chooses 2 actions which are executed in order of players&rsquo; reputation, so that those in the lead have the disadvantage of having to act before they know the full extent of their enemies&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>During their turns, players can move through the different city districts, making use of location-specific abilities or simply causing mayhem; tipping off the police about their opponents&rsquo; activities or playing intrigue cards which leverage their underworld connections to thwart their rivals&rsquo; plans.<br/><br/>Each round, after the players have completed their actions, the police will raid the district with the most crime and tip-offs in an attempt to round up those responsible. Going to prison will slow down your ascent to the top, but it can help you make some useful connections. At the end of each round, the players who managed to evade the long arm of the law score reputation points based on the level of crime in their districts.<br/>Yōkai: City of Crime is a simple, dynamic game (it takes only 30-45 minutes to play, even with five players) with a large dose of negative interaction.

They&rsquo;re new, separate stories with a more relaxed feel &ndash; you&rsquo;ve won the respective Cycle after all &ndash; now you can take a more leisurely approach to travel around the Map.<br/><br/>New special adventure hubs tell new, uplifting stories of people coming to grips with the ending of each of these Cycles. Mind you, there is still danger in the world, some brand new, but the way you approach it is different.<br/><br/>Along with the new stories come new rules. The aforementioned new Voyage rules that allow for a more relaxed pace, completely new rewards and penalties for adventures, and new thematic Battles.<br/><br/>As the Onwards Odyssey stories take place after the corresponding Cycle, you won&rsquo;t be able to access normal Cycle hubs&hellip; but you will be able to experience some of the R&amp;R, Dreams of Pharos and Inward Odyssey adventures you&rsquo;ve missed.<br/><br/>To keep it interesting, there is a caveat to going on an Onwards Odyssey though! During normal play, once you cross from Cycle to Cycle, you base Argo stats replenish. No such luck with Onwards Odyssey! So, if you were running on empty and snatched victory out of the jaws of defeat at the last moment, you&rsquo;ll be hard-pressed to rebuild your ship and crew before you move to Lakonia or Delphi.<br/>Onwards Odyssey is more than 50k words of stories, rules, battles and secrets!<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Sixty-four reproducible contracts are included for all sizes of units, from Special Forces to Battalions.<br/><br/>Hot Spots also includes a Game-Master's book, providing help with customizing your campaign as well as information on the current political background of the Inner Sphere, and the real stories behind the contracts. Hot Spots is for use with BattleTech, BattleSpace, BattleTroops, BattleForce and MechWarrior, Second Edition.<br/><br/>Hot Spots. Now you have what it really takes.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This expansion is rather unusual for BattleTech, in that it's not a full box-set pattern expansion like BattleForce, but it consists of two volumes, rather than just one. This was entirely deliberate, as this expansion is for use across most of the BattleTech game systems of the time, which included Mechwarrior: Second Edition. The first volume of the book is intended for the Gamesmaster, and contains information on creating contracts and campaigns for mercenary units; the second volume contains actual mock-up contracts that relate to scenarios in the first volume, and is intended to be handed over to the group when they're shopping for contracts.<br/><br/>Hot Spots is more than a simple aid for MechWarrior, though; it's littered with detail suitable for constructing gaming campaigns around, and contains a very useful guide to generating various kinds of raiding party or garrison force. This is particularly useful for generating games based on unit details from sourcebooks such as the five assorted House Books, the Guide to the Periphery and the like.<br/><br/>Although it was released seperately, this is very much a companion expansion for BattleTech: The Mercenary's Handbook, and was released the same year.<br/><br/>",

Its hull is comprised of sheets of bonded titanium able to withstand conventional ballistics, as well as laser and plasma fire. Its only real weakness is when confronted by dedicated anti-tank weaponry. It employs a sophisticated sensor array which assists ground troops to be more efficient with their tactics, relaying battlefield info to the ground commanders over their headsets.<br/><br/>The weaponry of the M577 can make it a very dangerous foe to get close to. On the top of it is a retractable Boyars PARS-150 phased plasma cannon turret. The barrels on this thermal kinetic cannon alternate their fire so as to not overheat, allowing the weapon to blast its enemies continuously if need be. A Republic Electric RE700 20mm gatling cannon is mounted in the front of the vehicle, which is able to switch between caseless HEAP rounds and what is affectionately known as ?Beehive? Anti-Personnel Flechettes. Finally, it is also armed with an automatic light mortar which is mounted on the roof of the carrier to be used against foes that have dug into tough defensive positions.<br/><br/>The interior is very roomy and in addition to the driver and section commander, it can also carry weapons and other stowage, as well as up to thirteen additional personnel in yoke harnesses restraints, allowing for it to be used in orbital combat drops when carried by a UD-4L Dropship.<br/><br/>Box set contains:<br/><br/>1x multipart resin APC model<br/>1x Heist gamemode leaflet<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is, to be the first to set up a fixed number of trading posts and to have no debts as a colonial power. The count of trading posts is recommended by the rules according to the desired game length and number of players, but can be adjusted by the players. During the game, players must build new colonies, manage their national budgets, strategically shift armies, conduct diplomatic negotiations on war and peace, conquer other colonies, defend their own colonies, and plan and conduct their intelligence activity.<br/><br/>",

A typical two-player game with about 100 figures a side will play out in 1 to 1 &frac12; hours but it will easily expand to a bigger, multi-player set-up once everyone is familiar with the common and easily-memorized mechanisms.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer at WI<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Join our esteemed guest editor Jacques O&rsquo;Lanterne as we dig in to what makes Necromantic Horror teams tick. You&rsquo;ll thrill to hear how Necromancers put together their teams (literally, in the case of Flesh Golems), as well as the sordid history of some infamous Sylvanian teams.<br/><br/>The 36 pages of this dusty tome are stuffed with all manner of dark humour, rules to raise your team (from the grave), and advice to guide them to victory. As the first Spike! Journal to be published after the new edition of Blood Bowl, the content has been adjusted ever so slightly, but it will feel quite familiar to long-time sports fans. It includes:<br/><br/>- Things That Go Bump in the Night: covers where Necromantic Horror teams arise from, as well as an overview of each position &ndash; Zombie Linemen, Ghoul Runners, Wraiths, Werewolves, and Flesh Golems.<br/><br/>- Famous Necromantic Horror teams, including the Wolfenburg Crypt-stealers, Bruendar Grimjacks, and Pumpkin Patch Petrifiers, plus full profiles for the Star Players that can be hired.<br/><br/>- Star Player Spotlight: Frank &rsquo;n&rsquo; Stein &ndash; the Flesh Golem that combined the brains and brawn of two decent players to become something greater than the sum of his parts.<br/><br/>- Dirt From the Dugout: Mindy Piewhistle returns with the graveyard dirt on rumours of a Star Player's potential retirement &ndash; could he have a life after the gridiron?<br/><br/>- Star Player Spotlight: Wilhelm &lsquo;the Wolfman&rsquo; Chaney &ndash; growing up as an outcast from Human society has made Wilhelm a somewhat eccentric personality, but his savagery in the field more than make up for it.<br/><br/>- Sylvanian Night-time Leagues: Custom rules for running a league season as the Spooky Skull Cup, as well as special rules to represent games played in Sylvania.<br/><br/>- Chat with the Rat: Hackspit sits down with the coach of the Bruendar Grimjacks about scouting and recruiting new players for Necromantic Horror teams.<br/><br/>- Trick or Treat: the pro playbook for new Necromantic Horror coaches, including advice on raising a solid roster, developing their skills, and running effective plays.<br/><br/>- Star Player Spotlight: Bryce &lsquo;the Slice&rsquo; Cambuel &ndash; after a premature and self-inflicted end to his career as a living player, this chainsaw-wielding Blocker was revived to give it another go in the afterlife.<br/><br/>- Eerie Inducements: hire some of the unsavoury characters that abound in these dark and dismal lands.<br/><br/>- A new episode of Mighty Blow!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In addition to being an incredibly popular pastime, beloved by an impressively broad and diverse fanbase, Blood Bowl is also a shockingly lucrative business. Imperial Nobility teams have been springing up out of the woodwork of late, the seemingly bottomless coffers of their patrons hiring top talent, providing the finest equipment and training facilities, and supporting their teams through extensive advertising campaigns. The B&ouml;genhafen Barons are the most popular of such teams, exploding onto the scene and shaking things up.<br/><br/>While superficially similar to Human teams, the Imperial Nobility have a different skill set that makes them very tricky to play against. A well-coached team can keep their opponents guessing while setting up the solid Noble Blitzers to score. They look absolutely incredible whether they're winning or losing, clad in the finest equipment you're likely to see on any pitch.<br/><br/>This multipart plastic kit contains all the components you need to build the B&ouml;genhafen Barons, an Imperial Nobility team for use in games of Blood Bowl. It contains 12 players:<br/>&ndash; 4 Imperial Retainer Linemen<br/>&ndash; 4 Bodyguards<br/>&ndash; 2 Noble Blitzers<br/>&ndash; 2 Imperial Throwers<br/><br/>You'll also find 2 turn counters, 2 coins, 4 balls, 12 32mm Round Blood Bowl bases, and a transfer sheet.<br/><br/>The rules to use Imperial Nobility teams in your games of Blood Bowl can be found in Blood Bowl (Second Season Edition): Spike! Journal #12<br/><br/>This item is contained in Blood Bowl: Second Season Edition<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

If quick play is what you&rsquo;re looking for, the Tournament Mode module will let you simulate the early and middle rounds of an entire tournament in about 20 minutes, reducing the field to a handful of finalists. You can then use the &ldquo;For The Set&rdquo; and &ldquo;No Rally&rdquo; modules to resolve the remaining tournament matches in 10 to 20 minutes more.<br/><br/>On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re looking for detail, the &ldquo;point-by-point&rdquo; module will let you watch the action unfold as if you were courtside, with serves, returns, difficult shots, winners, momentum and even unusual and rare results.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;For the Set&rdquo; module is the main tool in the box. It serves as a bridge between the two extremes of speed and detail. It will instantly resolve the preliminary action of a set and take you to the potential set-deciding game--one player with the opportunity to win the sixth and deciding game of the set. From there, you can get to your final result with extended drama, point-by-point, or instantly via the &ldquo;No Rally&rdquo; results.<br/><br/>",

Both teams can call on their Mentor (Ezio Auditore or Cesare Borgia) to come help them.<br/><br/>Objectives are variable and range from destroying the other team&rsquo;s Tower to capturing an Objective in the other side&rsquo;s territory, to eliminating all the opponents&rsquo; team and more.

Whenever the Traveler is played, you introduce their Time Pod, which you can use to teleport around the map. Of course when you rip through space time there are bound to be consequences.

        "description": "In Factions: Battlegrounds, you take on the role of a general who's leading an army of troops, spellcasters, beasts, and mythological monsters into battle. You and the opposing generals determine the battleground, gather resources, and score points by eliminating enemy units. Whoever first captures 25 points of units wins.<br/><br/>In more detail, to set up choose one of the six factions in the game; each faction has twelve unique units and five &quot;home terrain&quot; cards that work well with your units. Players then take turns building the battleground by placing one terrain card at a time into the 3x3 grid, each terrain card is divided into a 2x2 grid, so the entire grid of play is 6x6. Whoever places terrain first has an advantage since they have more home terrain than other players, while players who go later during set up determine the location of resource centers on the battleground or recruit their starting units last so that they can respond to the choices of opponents. Units cost 1-5 gold, and each player can spend up to 10 gold on starting units, keeping anything unspent.<br/><br/>During a round, all units have the chance to move, with the highest-ranked units moving first and with ties being broken in favor of whoever has the most captains, followed by whoever has the most units. Each unit has a movement, attack, and health value, along with an indication of whether it generates gold or mana and (possibly) a spell that it can cast. After moving a unit, you can attack with it, whether melee or ranged as indicated on the card. If you defeat an enemy unit, you can points equal to its cost in gold, so while expensive units tend to be the most powerful, they also provide an opponent with their biggest target for points.<br/><br/>Prior to activating a unit on your turn, you can pay gold to recruit new units, and those units will slip into rank order for the turn, possibly allowing you to put a high-ranking unit into play directly and giving an opponent someone on the battleground that they didn't expect.<br/><br/>Once all the units have moved, players collect resources for units that gain them automatically and for units located on resource centers. Rounds continue until someone has collected 25 points of captured units, at which point they win immediately.<br/><br/>Factions: Battlegrounds is centered on inclusion and diversity, incorporating mythology from all over the world and representing traditionally European-based fantasy elements with underrepresented cultural elements.<br/><br/>",

Camarilla Edition has since been reckoned as the &quot;Second Edition&quot; of the game, thanks to the release of Vampire: The Eternal Struggle Third Edition.<br/><br/>As the name implies, Camarilla Edition was the first V:TES expansion set to focus primarily on the clans and Kindred of the Camarilla. Most of the new cards introduced in this set are crypt cards (vampires), and are drawn from a variety of Vampire: The Masquerade sources, primarily Children of the Night and the various &quot;by Night&quot; city sourcebooks. The complete set of these 100 new crypt cards was later reprinted as the Blood Shadowed Court factory set.<br/><br/>The six clans spotlighted in this set are the Brujah, Malkavian, Nosferatu, Toreador, Tremere and Ventrue, and each of these six clans has its own preconstructed starter deck for this set. The set follows the metaplot of Vampire: The Masquerade, in which the Gangrel left the Camarilla and became independent; they appeared as a mostly-independent clan in the next expansion set, Anarchs.<br/><br/>",

Will you stick with the base ship and pay to upgrade and hire new crew? or purchase bigger ships with unique abilities and upgrade those? Either strategy has its advantages. Whatever you decide, there are multiple ways to mod your dice pool and give yourself the best chances of success.<br/><br/>Space Exploration<br/><br/>Travelling through space is a risky business, flipping and resolving hex tiles as you move. Each tile refreshes after use, making space constantly changing with potential danger at every turn.<br/><br/>Dice Combat<br/><br/>Using the stats you have modded with crew, ships and upgrades, gather your dice and shoot. With upgrades and loot cards etc. allowing you to mitigate poor dice rolls and a flee system giving you the chance to avoid the worst, the combat system gives you a good balance of strategy and luck.<br/><br/>Gain Legend<br/><br/>Legend is gained from winning battles, dominating colonised planets and completing contracts/events.

        "description": "With the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, the tension between the Northern and Southern States boiled over into outright hostility. Birthed in the South, the Confederacy fought to maintain its independency whilst Northern troops headed south in a bid to preserve the union. Four years of hellish fighting ensued, consuming the nation. It was a war the likes of which the Americas had not seen before, and would never again.<br/><br/>It is one of the most studied military conflicts in history, with over 237 named battles in addition to innumerable minor actions and skirmishes. Tactically, battles were still largely linear - regiments frequently fired all their ammunition only to be relieved by a second wave of troops passing through the line. However, the technology of war had become all the more destructive, and casualty rates were atrocious, leading to some historians citing the warfare of the American Civil War to be a precursor to that of the 1st World War over 50 years later.<br/><br/>The Epic Battles system allows for gamers to refight these battles on a huge scale.  The game is based on the familiar award-winning Black Powder rules system, with a few period-flavour tweaks to cement the battles in the ideologies of American Civil War doctrines.<br/><br/>This box set contains no less than 2400 men. Each of the two armies are presented on colour-coded plastic sprues; the push-fit pieces are extremely easy to assemble - enabling you to quickly get to the business of gaming this fascinating era of history on the epic scale it deserves. You&rsquo;ll also find some MDF scenery to lend your battles extra authenticity.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

How many boys and girls should you bring? Will you bring a girl secretly dressed up as a boy to foil your opponent's plans?<br/><br/>Both players start with a secret goal, and need to manipulate the gender mix in play to fulfil their goals. There are opportunities to swap your secret goal and to change the gender of a dancer. When a round ends, you reveal your goals to compare who has done better. There are instant-win conditions on some cards. If you manage to achieve these feats, you win a round immediately.<br/><br/>This short and tricky card game features bluffing, setting traps, pushing your luck and reading your opponent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>2021 BGG 9-Card Nanogame Print-and-Play Design Contest Best Overall Game<br/>2021 BGG 9-Card Nanogame Print-and-Play Design Contest Best 2-player Game<br/>2021 BGG 9-Card Nanogame Print-and-Play Design Contest Best New Designer<br/>2021 BGG 9-Card Nanogame Print-and-Play Design Contest Best Rule Book<br/><br/>",

This expansion map reflects the rapid growth of interurban railways and the competition to keep growing or go bust.<br/><br/>This Age of Steam expansion map features a Power Plant track in place of the Engine (Locomotive) track of the base game and requires players to make deliveries equal to or greater than their best delivery. All players start in hexes adjacent to Kansas City and expand outwards. The initial cost for the starting spaces and building a power plant make the beginning game very costly. Players must carefully consider pushing forward for longer deliveries because once they are done, there is no going back to shorter deliveries.<br/><br/>This expansion map was released for attendees of the  inaugural Age of Steam Con in March 2018 and then made available for purchase at and after HeavyCon in May 2018.<br/><br/>",

When the Night swept through, he was feeding the hounds, making sure the pack leader, Dex, did not take too much more than his fair share. The Vampires sensed the vicious nature of the hunting dogs, so it was the pack that the Vampires turned, while the workers and family were simply drained as food. But the kennel master&rsquo;s de&not;votion to his pack gave him the strength to cling to this world, although the corruption in his dying body meant he was no longer truly capable of that emotion.<br/>Caring for the pack of Guardians was now his new role in the clan and soon the pack ran at the vanguard of the Vampire raiding parties. With so much blood spilt, his power grew, as did the Guardian&rsquo;s alpha, who was seemingly immune to the harm that caused attrition to the pack. What was devotion was now an unholy bond, passing power in both directions.<br/><br/>Slowly the pack began to spend more time hunting and sleeping alone. Despite their ag&not;gression, Guardians fell in battle, and eventu&not;ally it was just the pair that was left. No-one from the clan was there to chastise the kennel master for his slack work, but then, he was no mere minion anymore and would not take criticism easily.<br/><br/>No, Gareth and Dex had grown to be the Elders Gugadeth and the Beast, forever bound as a pack of two.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In the game students are divided into small groups of 2 to 6 members, each playing a ministerial role in the government of six nations that correspond roughly to the real-life participants of the Korean War conflict.<br/><br/>The nations are:<br/><br/>Inland (N Korea)<br/>Outland (S Korea)<br/>Transania (Soviet Union)<br/>Hameel (China)<br/>New Zenith (the West)<br/>and Nordo (India, the Third World?)<br/><br/>This game was originally released as a seven box set. Each nation receives its own box (as named above) of briefing materials. In addition, the Control box contains materials for the instructor to moderate the game.<br/><br/>In Dangerous Parallel, there are a number of different scenarios.  The one that I played is essentially the same as the Korean War.  Inland invades Outland who are aided by New Zenith.  After a vicious and successful counterattack, the players are asked to make the next move.  Will, for example, Hameel aid Inland, risking nuclear war if Transania becomes involved.<br/><br/>Each country has the following ministers:<br/><br/>Chief Minister<br/>Defense Minister<br/>Political Minister (Minister of Interior, or Police)<br/>Foreign Minister<br/>Foreign Intelligence Minister<br/>Economics Minister<br/>Minister of Information<br/>Several Ambassadors<br/><br/>There is a requirement that the Foreign Minister is not the Chief Minister to allow for espionage.  Also, you can allow for multiple roles for each participant.<br/><br/>",

It is a complete conflict simulation about the Second World War for 2-5 players on divisional scale. This boardgame does not replace World in Flames - The Final Edition but supplements it in fine detail for the afficionado of World War II history.<br/><br/>While based on Australian Design Group's award winning game World in Flames, the Master edition has many new features including:<br/>&bull; monthly turns;<br/>&bull; divisional scale;<br/>&bull; reserve movement;<br/>&bull; crack units for every major power (like Guard Banner Armies);<br/>&bull; complete new land combat system including battle points (like surprise points within naval battles), simultaneous attack/defence dice rolls and reserve movement after combat (both attacker and defender);<br/>&bull; and much much more (see fuller description below).<br/><br/>WiF Master edition is a complete boxed game that comes in two versions, the standard game played using the 5 World in Flames maps (i.e. can be played within the same space as the current game) and the deluxe version which includes 6 large maps (and the US minimap) providing far greater scope for sweeping operational manoeuvres across the globe.<br/><br/>The rules are the same length as the current rule set and you can download the draft version at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gdg.de\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.gdg.de</a>.<br/><br/>Contents<br/>&bull; 6 large (1168mm x 820mm) maps<br/>&bull; 4800 full colour counters<br/>&bull; 1 Rules book<br/>&bull; 1 Scenarios book<br/>&bull; Combat Charts<br/>&bull; 2 x 10-sided dice<br/><br/>",

Transformed from merchant-princes to a military juggernaut by years of war, the alliance with House Davion gave them the most powerful 'Mechs money can buy and a streamlined chain of command. Now, the Steiner-Davion alliance has fractured from within, threatening to engulf both nations in civil war.<br/><br/>BattleTech Field Manual: Lyran Alliance reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the new Alliance forces. This manual describes each Lyran regiment and its loyalties, profiles and special rules, plus cutting-edge equipment and the latest 'Mechs from the famed Steiner factories.<br/><br/>User comment<br/><br/>This sequel to the earlier House Steiner (The Lyran Commonwealth) is the penultimate volume in the FIeld Manuals series for BattleTech to be published by FASA. It follows much the same format as the other Field Manuals in that it focuses largely on the military structure of the Capellan Confederation before introducing a scattering of new equipment and units. Suiting the original Steiner theme in the fluff, all of the new discoveries are biased towards the heavy end of the spectrum, and consist of such things as Heavy Gauss Rifles, a new Assault 'Mech, and the largest Warship ever constructed in the Inner Sphere.<br/><br/>This sourcebook is out of print, and hasn't been released in an electronic format by the new license holder, That makes this one of the harder to find Field Manuals.<br/><br/>",

All over the region, British Paratroopers slipped through the night to capture or destroy bridges and strongholds, key to control of the battlefield.<br/><br/>Along the way, they fought in endless skirmishes against garrison and Ost troops, as well as Panzergrenadiers.

Besides the supplied scenarios, there is an almost limitless number of situations you can design on your own.<br/><br/>Soldiers are armed with various weapons, which include the German GewehrK98K Mauser rifle, MP38 machine pistol, and MG 34 light machine gun, and the Russian Mosin Nagant M1891/30 rifle, PPSh-41 machine pistol, and DP 1928 light machine gun.  Each weapon has its own characteristics for range, penetration, effectiveness, and reliability.  Enough men are supplied (33 for each side) to fit out squads of many different varieties.<br/><br/>Supplied scenarios include:  Clash of Squads (CL1), Meeting Engagement (CL2), Hotel Henn (CL3), Scamble at Dusk (CL4), Reconnaissance in Force (CL5), and Breakthrough (CL6).  Each scenario has its own victory conditions, special rules, and play variants.<br/><br/>The game comes complete with Map 1 &amp; Map 2 (8.5&quot;x11&quot; each),  German counter set A (60 counters &amp; markers), Russian counter set B (60 counters &amp; markers), two identical double-sided Reference Cards, three double-sided Scenario Cards (with six scenarios), and 12-page illustrated rule booklet.<br/><br/>",

These new ones just have alternate abilities and tougher game play values.<br/><br/>According to SotLT creator, Christopher Batarlis, &quot;They were originally part of a Kickstarter promotion with Level 99 Games. They gave us some cards from Argent the Consortium to put in Secrets and Vice Versa. We also had a few extras and gave them out to people at Gencon 2015.<br/><br/>They can be substituted out for the originals! They're a bit more challenging.&quot;<br/><br/>The three Epic Bosses are:<br/><br/>Rhaz Azul Ahamet<br/><br/>The Forsaken King<br/><br/>Herathulhu<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With the final defeat of Napol&eacute;on Bonaparte, a new conservative era of anti-liberal and anti-republican politics began in Europe. It was a false dawn for the forces of reaction. In the Americas, Spain&rsquo;s empire evaporated in a series of rebellions. The defeat of the republicans led to a renewal in great power struggles, such as the Crimean War, and nationalist and expansionist wars. The middle of the century saw the unification of Italy and Germany through warfare. America, wracked by division over slavery, politics, and economics, was ripped apart by a civil war that ended in the reunification of the nation.<br/><br/>The great changes in government and ideology were matched by a shift towards industrialized war. By the 1850s railroads, telegraphs, and photographs were changing the face of battle. The smoothbore flintlock was replaced by the rifled musket, which was in turn replaced with repeating rifles. The era of linear combat, the basic tactics of western warfare for thousands of years, now gave way to a looser form of warfare, where technology was as important as training and generals. It was the end of an era.<br/><br/>The battles included are...<br/><br/>Ayacucho - December 9, 1824 &ndash; &ldquo;If from Romulus, Rome; from Bol&iacute;var, it is Bolivia.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The Alamo - March 6, 1836 &ndash; &ldquo;What are the lives of soldiers, than so many chickens?&rdquo;<br/><br/>Mudki - December 18, 1845 &ndash; Opening Battle of the First Anglo-Sikh War<br/><br/>Buena Vista - February 23, 1847 &ndash; &ldquo;Tell him to give &lsquo;em hell!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Cerro Gordo - April 17-18, 1847 &ndash; &ldquo;Mexico no longer has an army.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Novara - March 22, 1849 &ndash; The Abdication of Charles Albert I<br/><br/>Balaclava - October 25, 1854 &ndash; &ldquo;There, my lord, is your enemy! There are your guns!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Inkerman - November 5, 1854 &ndash; &ldquo;I tell you, we gave &lsquo;em a hell of a towelling.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Second Sevastopol - September 8, 1855 &ndash; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m here, and I shall stay here.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Solferino - June 24, 1859 &ndash; The Birth of the Red Cross<br/><br/>Volturno - October 1, 1860 &ndash; &ldquo;Victory all along the Line!&rdquo;<br/><br/>First Bull Run - July 21, 1861 &ndash; &ldquo;There is Jackson standing like a stone wall.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Second Bull Run - August 28-30, 1862 &ndash; The Confederacy at Flood Tide<br/><br/>Antietam - September 17, 1862  &ndash; The Bloodiest Day of the American Civil War<br/><br/>Irish Bend - April 14, 1863 &ndash; &ldquo;Grover had stopped just short of the prize.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Rangiriri - November 20, 1863 &ndash; Death Knell of the Kīngitanga Movement<br/><br/>Lookout Mountain - November 24, 1863 &ndash; &ldquo;It is all poetry.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Missionary Ridge - November 25, 1863 &ndash; &ldquo;When those fellows get started all hell can&rsquo;t stop them.&rdquo;<br/><br/>First Petersburg - June 15-18, 1864 &ndash; &ldquo;You cannot strike a full blow with a wounded hand.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Peach Tree Creek - July 20, 1864 &ndash; Hood Takes Command<br/><br/>Cedar Creek - October 19, 1864 &ndash; &ldquo;God DAMN you, don&rsquo;t cheer me!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Selma - April 2, 1865 &ndash; &ldquo;Go in boys, give them hell, we have the city...&rdquo;<br/><br/>First Tuyut&iacute; - May 24, 1866 &ndash; The South American Waterloo<br/><br/>K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz - July 3, 1866 &ndash; K&ouml;niggr&auml;tzer Marsch<br/><br/>&mdash;description of the publisher<br/><br/>",

Originally intended as a small line of Generic Hero Classes, the results were so compelling and un-generic, each hero's appearance told so many exciting stories that we wanted to integrate them into the KD world but so far nothing concrete has emerged.<br/><br/>Plundering indiscriminately, the swashbucklers crippling kleptomania keeps her ship barely bobbing over the surface of the waves. Lost at sea as a child, she spent years surviving along on a deserted island. Scavenging for scraps to eke out a meager existence she pathologically finds need to ransack her victims for strange odds and ends.<br/><br/>Her fate took a turn when she boarded a cursed gallion, stealing a coat of otherworldly splendor. The coat, armed with spectral pistols fires at random, often causing violent accidents and winning her no friends.<br/><br/>",

Corporate may ask you to make sure your zoo contains at least 3 continuous monorail connections, or have at least 1 enclosure, 1 monorail connection, and 1 scoring attraction, for example.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll play three rounds of Mesozooic like normal, but your goal each round is to work together and collectively meet or exceed the score shown on the level card. As long as at least one player meets the requirements for the mandate, the card will be discarded. For each incomplete mandate, 10 points will be subtracted from the round&rsquo;s score. If the final total is lower than the value on the level you chose, players will immediately lose. So make sure to divide and conquer as you work together to keep Corporate happy!<br/><br/>In the competitive variant, three mandates will be available each round to all players. Each player will score 3 extra points for each mandate they complete.<br/><br/>In the Jurassic Mini Expansion there are 8 mascot cards. There are mascots for the enclosures, attractions and trucks, monorails, topiaries, and advanced cards.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, shuffle the mascot cards facedown. Then take mascots equal to the number of players and place them faceup in the middle of the table. Flip the timer and begin sliding cards like normal to create your zoo. At any time after the timer is flipped, when you don&rsquo;t want to slide any more cards, you can take one available mascot. You can only take one mascot per round and once you hire a mascot you can&rsquo;t slide any more cards. So choose carefully!<br/><br/>Mascots are placed at the intersection of four cards in your zoo. For each card the mascot overlaps that shows the matching feature, score 1 point.<br/><br/>-description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Air &amp; Armor: Wurzburg, Operational Armored Warfare in Europe, Designer Signature Edition marks the return of one of the most realistic wargames on modern warfare ever published. Air &amp; Armor is a grand tactical simulation of a hypothetical Soviet attack on West Germany in the mid-1980s. It depicts the collision of the Soviet 8th Guards Army with elements of the U.S. 3rd Infantry Division and the West German 12th Panzer Division in ferocious battles around the German city of Würzburg. This new edition is lovingly recreated with an updated order of battle, new map artwork, new unit counters, revised rules, and new scenarios.<br/><br/>Air &amp; Armor employs a highly interactive game system with asymmetric rules modeling the different command &amp; control capabilities of each alliance. The game simulates all major aspects of modern warfare, including reconnaissance, combined arms operations, air, helicopter, and artillery strikes, chemical and electronic warfare, and combat engineering. Multiple levels of hidden intelligence produce a true &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; providing plenty of opportunities for deception, surprise, traps, and ambushes. Play this game to experience what it would have been like to command a division in battle if the Cold War had gone hot.<br/><br/>Air &amp; Armor features twelve different scenarios, each a complete game by itself. Each scenario covers a different battlefield operation, including a meeting engagement, a delaying action, a frontal assault, an attack on a fortified line, an attack on a flank, a major river crossing operation, a NATO counterattack, an envelopment operation, and a breakout from a pocket.  Extensive Scenario, Player, and Designer Notes provide advice on play and historical detail.<br/><br/>Air &amp; Armor is ideal for solitaire play.  The hidden intelligence system provides a high level of tension during solitaire play because, even though a solo player is commanding both sides, he never knows what he will hit when he conducts an operation.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>Complexity:  High<br/>Time Scale: 1 Turn = 2 Hours<br/>Map Scale: 1 Mile/Hex<br/>Unit Scale: Companies to Regiments<br/>Players: 1-7 Players<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/>Playing Time: 3 to 12 hours based on Scenario<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The battle has been described as Rommel's greatest victory, leading to the Axis capture of Tobruk, the British abandonment of Libya, and subsequent retreat to El Alamein.<br/><br/>Players represent the two army commanders, Rommel and Ritchie, maneuvering the various brigades and regiments under their command in order to control the vital port of Tobruk and defeat the enemy forces while still preserving his own army as a force in being.<br/><br/>This is complete revision of the Conflict Games edition designed by Frank Chadwick and first published in 1975 &mdash; consider this a completely NEW game and not a reprint of a previous edition. This new game features extensively researched and revised orders of battle, conversion to a d10 resolution method, all-new weather rules, all-new air rules showing the army-air force coordination that was being perfected by both sides, an all-new map at half of the original game's ground scale (1.5 mi/hex vs 3 mi/hex), and a switch from an Igo-Yugo to a chit-pull formation activation mechanism. But the most exciting change is a dynamic Operations Phase wherein players can decide exactly when and with which units they want to move, fight, barrage, or call in an air strike. No fixed Movement Phase, Combat Phase, Indirect Fire Phase, or Air Strike Phase...it's up to players how they want to construct their own turns.

        "description": "1914 Deluxe is an operational level hex-and-counter wargame that covers the first few months of the First World War when the German Army began its offensive into neighboring France. The German player must decide how best to perform the initial invasion. Should it be a direct assault across the French border, or should the assault follow the &ldquo;Schlieffen Plan&rdquo; of a march through a more lightly defended Belgium? Several factors outside of the players&rsquo; control add challenges, frustration, and a high level of replayability. Will the players be able to define their own invasion plans or will their respective &ldquo;High Commands&rdquo; dictate a pre-determined setup? Will treaties be signed with neighboring states that might impact the availability of additional forces? And what of the looming threat of action on the Eastern Front? All these provide a variable, but accurate simulation of the First World War&rsquo;s opening moves.<br/><br/>The game includes a huge 34&rdquo; by 44&rdquo; map that covers the western border of France from Belgium and the North Sea to Switzerland in the south at roughly ten miles per hex. Combat units are mostly corps, with a smattering of divisions and brigades, representing infantry, cavalry, and artillery. These pieces represent the forces of not only Germany and France, but also Great Britain, Belgium, The Netherlands, and even a couple of Italians. The terrain depicted on the map is a challenge to navigate, with forces depending upon the use of rail lines to more quickly advance and provide the supply needed to fight.<br/><br/>The basis for 1914 Deluxe is the original 1914 game published by The Avalon Hill Game Company in March of 1968. The project began as an effort to create an updated version of the original game&rsquo;s ugly &ldquo;painted&rdquo; map that is difficult to decipher in many respects. Once completed, it was not that much of an effort to also create a new, colorful set of counters (including new informational markers) that simplifies play. It was then a short, additional step to rewrite the rules in a manner that incorporates some of the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; rules, some new rules, and known errata to create a new, cohesive rules set of under twelve pages.<br/><br/>This updated version takes what was originally a difficult game to play, more due to its components than its rules, and provides a relatively simple, exciting, and highly replayable gaming experience. For those who prefer the original game (warts and all), they are welcome to simply use the new map with or without the new counters for a more colorful experience.<br/><br/>Now, YOU can refight the opening months of the First World War!<br/><br/>1914 Deluxe: Hell Unleashed is available from War Diary Publications.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Steam Battalions is a non-collectible, customized deck XCG, or Expandable Card Battle Game featuring stunning Steampunk &amp; Dieselpunk art in which 2 players face-off against each other, each using a customized deck they create from their own Starter Deck at the beginning of the game. Each Starter Deck contains the same specific 68 cards, from which each player customizes their own deck down to 40 cards plus 3 &quot;deck-diving&quot; Armory Cards, as outlined in the Steam Battalions rulebook.<br/><br/>THE STORY:<br/><br/>In an alternate past, the great wars of the early 20th century are waging high above the clouds and across the mud-filled trenches of Europe. The armies of the World's Superpowers battle for supremacy with elite units forged in brass, iron and steel in a technological arms race powered by diesel and steam. You &amp; your opponent create, customize &amp; command your own elite Steam Battalions of Deck-Dueling Steampunk &amp; Dieselpunk Dirigibles, Airships &amp; Superheroes &amp; send them into battle equipped with powerful Upgrades &amp; Tech in the quest for Victory!<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/><br/>Steam Battalions is a fast-paced, 1-vs-1 Customized-Deck Dueling Steampunk Card Battle Game for ages 12 &amp; up that takes approximately 30-45 minutes to play. The objective is to be the first player to get 7 victory points (defeating 7 of your opponent&rsquo;s units), or if your opponent has no units to move out from their trench, whichever comes first.<br/><br/>Players customize their deck, choosing their own balance of the five card types in the game; Unit Cards to send into battle with their own unique abilities &amp; upgrade lines, Tech Cards to grant them special abilities, Power Cards to enable their attacks &amp; Medic Baloon Cards to repair damage during combat. Both players also start with three &quot;Armory&quot; Cards that allow them to search their deck for a desired card at key moments during the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay employs streamlined card combat mechanics with a unique twist on these special &quot;deck-diving&quot; Armory cards that deepens the strategy in ways unique from other card battle games. In Steam Battalions, you can only receive &amp; play &quot;Armory&quot; cards after you lose one of your units. This prevents either player from gaining an insurmountable lead during early gameplay &amp; opens up new strategic choices you won't find in other games.<br/><br/>Unique game mechanics are designed to reduce the 'grinding' of most deck-dueling games while accelerating the pace of turns, combat, customization, upgrades, card-drawing &amp; strategy.<br/><br/><br/>     NOTE : Each player requires their own deck to play, so the game is sold as a complete two-player set of two starter decks. For even further customization, experienced players can purchase additional starter decks &amp; may add cards from as many additional starter decks as they wish, subject to the deck customization rules outlined in the Steam Battalions Rulebook (free for download at link below).<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

While her brothers were telling stories of their brave adventures, the beautiful princess was taught how to sing and sew. But this was not to be the destiny for stubborn ELSPETH. With the secret help of the king's master-at-arms, she practiced her swordsmanship every night &ndash; at first with one, but soon with two swords. It was her very teacher who told the princess about the evil across the Great Sea, lurking in the castle Karak. Elspeth was charmed by the master-at-arms' tale. She longed for her own tale, a story in which a womancould achieve as much glory as a man. Or perhaps even more! On the day ofher 18th birthday, she sneaked out of the palace and on a small schooner she sailed for her own adventure.<br/><br/>Dual Wielding: The Warrior Princess has been trained in the dual wield technique since her childhood. In every combat she can reroll one of her die if the roll is not to her liking. If she does, she has to use the rerolled value.<br/><br/>Tactical Reposition: The Warrior Princess can move through a tile containing a monster for a cost of one move and one HP. Afterwards the warrior princess is moved to a tile adjacent to the tile she has charged through. <br/>This skill can be used even when entering an undiscovered zone; in that case use the rules for entering an undiscovered zone.<br/><br/>Elspeth was originally released as bonus character available only in specialized retails. She was included as the seventh character in the English edition Catacombs of Karak (English-only edition) published by Outset Media and also in later Czech editions of the game.<br/><br/>The publisher (Albi) later released a printable pdf with Elspeth, usable for home use/printing.<br/><br/>Later publisher decided to add her into the mini expansion Karak: Sidhar, Kirima, Elspeth.<br/><br/>",

You have a number of attacking and defense cards (value from 1 to 5) that can be managed each round. There are different cards:<br/><br/><br/>    attacking cards ( punch and feint+punch )<br/>    defending cards ( block and dodge ) <br/><br/><br/>Cards are played following a few simple rules. This will affect ENDURANCE and DAMAGE tracks of both fighters. Damage points can get a knockdown (and you&acute;ll have to try if your boxer stands up or not) and if there are cuts. You have 100 endurance points to manage all over the fight. <br/>The way of playing cards sometimes is face down or face up (bluffing mechanic). If you play smart, you'll see it only doesn`t depend on the cards value, but also the way you raise your strategy in each round.<br/>  <br/> At the beginning of each round, there will be an auction using endurance points to see which boxer has initiative for that round.<br/>  <br/>Feints, blocks, damage, punches, endurance, counter attacks, combos, initiative, knockdowns, knockouts... are some elements included in this funny and strategic boxing card game where you get a highest interaction each time the bell rings. Depending on your cleverness and the correct strategy the referee will raise your arm or your opponent&acute;s at the end of the fight.

        "description": "If you like Hike! and wish to have an even bigger experience, the Events and Traits expansion is for you. It adds a hefty deck of 64 cards to the gameplay. It includes trait cards that players get at the beginning of the game and that give them a bit of asymmetric starting positions, and event cards that add another layer to card drafting, and present players with more options in the race phase. Event cards are divided into two groups - the majority of them are events that only influence the race track or the player that played them, and there are 12 event cards that include more player interaction and a bit of 'take that' element. Players can decide if they want these last 12 events part of the game or not. The cards include text in English.<br/><br/>-description from the Kickstarter campaign<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blitzkrieg, by Diffraction Entertainment, is a MONSTER wargame to end all monster wargames. The map of Europe is phenomenal in its size, detail, and accuracy. It uses a scale of 1 hex is 15 miles! There are over 4,000 counters!!! It includes land, air, and naval units. As a bonus, the game can be broken down into smaller mini campaigns, very helpful when you haven't the table area for the full map!!! I was privileged to talk in detail with John Bannerman, one of the designers.<br/><br/>This is part of the blurb from the game's web site.<br/><br/>4480 counters covering the ground, naval and air forces of (in order of &ldquo;appearance&rdquo;): Germany, Poland, Great Britain and The Commonwealth, France, the Soviet Union, Denmark, Norway, The Netherlands, Belgium and Italy.  These are supported by a meticulously researched Order of Battle for the first year of the Second World War and include additional details for the United Kingdom and Germany until June 1941.<br/><br/>17 map sections (14&rdquo; x 21&frac12;&rdquo;) for a total of 35 sq ft of maps from North Cape to Bologna and Brest to Minsk at 15 miles per hex.  Laid out, the maps occupy an area of approximately 7&rsquo; x 6&rsquo; and have been created using digital mapping software developed in-house by Diffraction Entertainment.  Maps have been painstakingly digitised from period topographical maps in the 1:250,000 to 1:300,000 range.<br/><br/>The extensive Rule Set has been devised from the start as a standard for the entire game series including a framework for an exhaustive set of Political and Economic rules defining each nation&rsquo;s operational parameters and special cases.  By the last game in the Second World War Series, these will have evolved into a detailed production model allowing players to explore different strategic options for the major combatants.<br/>Multiple modules covering Poland (Stab in the Back), Scandinavia (Operation Weser&uuml;bung), France 1940 plus The Battle of Britain (War in the West), and of course, Blitz!, a grand module to link all these together to cover the first year of the Second World War.<br/>Ground unit values are derived from OLI formulas originally devised by Trevor N Dupuy, a methodology that allows many different weapon systems to be consistently rated then summed using the ground unit&rsquo;s TO&amp;E to give a theoretical operational combat value.  Differences in national capabilities of training, leadership, communications and other &ldquo;soft&rdquo; factors are simulated using a Combat Effectiveness Value (CEV) for each nation which is then used as a multiplier to the basic unit combat value.  CEV evolves for each nation during the war showing increasing competence for Allied forces and, after initial increases due to combat experience, a decreasing capability for German forces as manpower and unit TO&amp;E&rsquo;s degrade in capability.<br/><br/>Naval units down to destroyers are shown as individual ship counters with lesser ships and submarines depicted as flotillas.  Major liners also have individual counters so as to denote their special high-speed capabilities for transporting personnel.  The naval system utilises a naval zone approximately 75 miles wide superimposed on the 15 mile hex grid so that the unique properties of naval and air-sea interaction can be modelled simply but still keep the essential flavour of naval operations with brief bursts of high intensity operations.<br/>Air Units are sized so that half units are available for carrier operations and have been rated by a bespoke system taking in to account a large number of performance parameters.  To reflect the attritional nature of air operations, air replacements are required to be expended just to keep forces in operation in addition to replacing combat losses.  Emphasis has been placed in the rules to encourage historical missions rather than wholesale commitment of airpower to offensive and defensive close air support.<br/><br/>",

Ship-wrecked seafarers wash ashore in droves to the small rocky island chain.  These scared islanders cling together in small groups, drinking rain water and hunting for any food they can find on the islands.  Something is in the water however, and  after only a few days a paranoia hijacks the islanders.  Compelled by a blinding bloodlust, the islanders begin to butcher one another.  Day after day the pale sun rises to watch these islanders hunt each other in a demented fury.  And day after day, more islanders wash ashore this forlorn archipelago only to be tainted by a toxic curse that festers in these waters&hellip;<br/><br/>Forlorn is a &lsquo;Survival, Team Strategy Game&rsquo;. There are several different game modes that are played using &lsquo;Islanders&rsquo;.  There are 31 Islanders that each function differently. Use your Islanders to compliment one another to defeat your opponents.<br/><br/>Forlorn is typically played with 2-4 players, however Last Man standing can be played with 8. The game modes are Capture the Flagon, King of the Hill, Regicide, and Last Man Standing.<br/><br/>Each game mode has a different objective, winning the objective earns a player 5 victory points and ends the game. Additionally each islander kill is worth 2 Victory points, and a sailor (a minion) is wort 1 Victory point.<br/><br/>This way a player that engages strategically and racks up kills can beat a player that camps and wins the game objective.<br/><br/>Forlorn has been tested for nearly 2 years and has come to a version that favors strategy, decisive thinking and psychology.

        "description": "Build your crypt, destroy the village, and defeat your rivals in Vampires &amp; Villagers: The Curse of Christoph!<br/><br/>The Vampires have grown displeased with the villagers of Askwith&rsquo;s ongoing challenges to their dominance. The Vampire Lords set out to destroy the town, while also battling each other for supremacy. You are a Vampire Lord in control of a crypt of creatures. The goal is to end the game with the most powerful crypt.  The game is played in a series of rounds as rival vampires build up their forces and deplete the village.  Every time the village square is emptied, the round ends and an event occurs. Many event effects are lasting; some favor the humans, while others favor the forces of darkness. The fourth time the square is cleared, Askwith is destroyed and the game is scored.<br/><br/>There are four character classes: Villagers, Vampire Hunters, Thralls, and Vampires, including Master Vampires, Lesser Vampires, and Turned Hunters. Players place their Vampires and Thralls in the &ldquo;crypt&rdquo; in front of them in order to be able to use them in play. The creatures in the crypt can be face up and active or face down, in shadows. Active creatures can directly attack the villagers, while creatures in shadows use stealth attacks. Thralls and turned hunters/slave vampires, when applicable, can also be used to defend a creature who has been targeted by a crypt attack.<br/><br/>Each turn, players draw 1 card and play 1 card, choosing to build up their crypts or use a hunter or strong villager to attack one of their rivals. During the next phases, players can use the skills of face-up cards and attack the village with direct attacks and stealth. Finally, crypt attacks and other residual actions from previous turns are resolved. During a crypt attack, the Hunter is supported by all of the Villagers in the square.<br/><br/>After the end of the fourth round, the game ends and the power value of all creatures in the crypt in front of each player are scored, along with any giant bat victory points. The player with the highest score is the reigning Vampire Lord!<br/><br/>Vampires and Villagers introduces an unusual semi-cooperative element. Players both attack the village in order to gain victory points and use the villagers against one another. A strong village is a useful weapon, but it can be used against you, as well. Vampires and Villagers is all about managing opposing goals &ndash; the successful player balances bringing about the end of rounds and the game quickly with strengthening their own crypt, while simultaneously preventing their opponents from doing the same.  Keeping your opponents off balance as you subtly drive the flow of the game is key to victory.<br/><br/>",

The sea is represented by a bag of chits full of fish and water tiles. In each round you will fish from this bag, taking some back to your facility for tinning while leaving others at sea to breed.<br/><br/>In order to win, you must maintain a delicate balance between fishing and allowing populations to grow. Each month will have a unique set of objectives, and your sustainability goals are as important as your financial targets. Each market is also unique with specific rules and strategies for making a profit.

        "description": "&quot;Goose Green&quot; is a Tactical Combat Series (TCS) board-wargame covering the first land battle of the Falklands War on May 28, 1982. The outcome of this engagement was crucial for both the Argentinians and the British: The Argentinians needed to prove themselves against the professional British war machine, while the British needed a land victory to satisfy the government and the public after recently suffering naval losses. Originally intended as a raid, the clash became a full 14-hour battle resulting in a hard-fought British victory.<br/><br/>Goose Green covers this entire battle in turns representing 20-30 minutes each, and a map scale of 125 yards per hex. Units range from sections to platoons. Both sides fielded what was roughly a reinforced Battalion, making for a battle that made for a quick playing game with great replay value. With just a minimum of special rules, this game brings the TCS to the 1980s, where in a classic infantry confrontation, not a lot has changed since WWII.<br/><br/>The British player must orchestrate a fast-paced attack crossing the entire map, removing all points of Argentinian resistance, and capturing Goose Green with a minimum of losses. He must make good use of few supporting arms available (half a battery of artillery, MILAN ATGMs and light mortar and MG support) to overcome dug-in Argentinian forces that outnumber the British by 2:1.<br/><br/>The Argentinian player has solid troops with reasonable artillery and air support but must create a defense in depth against a better lead British force accustomed to a higher operational tempo and greater firepower. Every turn requires important decisions of when to hold the line, when to withdraw, and where to commit the few remaining reserves to delay and possibly stop the British attack.<br/><br/>The Argentinians do not have the motivation and training level of the British but are dug-in with the benefit of minefields, trenches, numerous heavy weapons, and AA guns to assist the defense.<br/><br/>Scenarios:<br/><br/>The Battle of Goose Green (historical deployment, 39 turns)<br/>Burntside House and Low Pass (5 turns)<br/>Darwin Hill (15 turns)<br/>The Airfield and the Schoolhouse (14 turns)<br/>Bloody Goose Green (full battle with better Argentine deployment, 40 turns)<br/>Components:<br/><br/>TCS rulebook (version 4.01)<br/>Goose Green game-specific rulebook<br/>2 x TCS Charts &amp; Tables<br/>One Full Color Game Map (22&quot;x34&quot;)<br/>140 Counters<br/>Zip Lock Bag<br/><br/>-description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Now the time track is kept with the use of a in-game clock.<br/><br/>Several others improvements to balance and make the game more fluid and enjoyable.<br/><br/><br/>",

This faction, similar to the Sentinels is a game changer faction that will definitely turn the usual game concepts upside down. Using time travel markers, they can protect their territories in a very special way and use their time paradox attack to teleport entire armies back to their home territory - as if they had never left. Be surprised how the Chronomasters bring exciting new ideas to the game, while adding and changing the game in the usual Tsukuyumi manner.<br/><br/>As always, this faction is compatible with all previously released expansions and also includes cards for 2-player mode, 5 faction event cards and the ever-popular mascot.<br/><br/>Two years before the Moonfall, a spaceship with an experimental propulsion system was tested. Just six years later, this ship returned to Earth, with highly evolved apes aboard - the great-grandchildren of the six apes who had been trained to test the drive.<br/>Three generations later, the ship that created the black hole - the source of the drive - again traveled through space and time and returned to Earth. The ship was now populated by 40 apes who had converted the ship into a large space ark. They will come back to Earth to save it from what lurks in the future. There is only a small window of time for this, as there is already a wreck of their ark on Earth under tons of sand.<br/><br/>The Chronomasters are here to protect the Earth from the future, equipped with high technology and the knowledge of things to come.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Die Chronomaster sind 12 zeitreisende Affen, die aus der Zukunft zur&uuml;ckkehren, um die Erde vor der Katastrophe zu retten. Diese Fraktion, ist &auml;hnlich den Sentinels, eine Game Changer Fraktion, die durchaus die gewohnten Spielkonzepte auf den Kopf stellen wird. &Uuml;ber Zeitreisemarker k&ouml;nnen sie ihre Gebiete ganz besonders sch&uuml;tzen und mit ihrem Zeitparadox-Angriff ganze Armeen in ihr Heimatgebiet zur&uuml;ckteleportieren - als w&auml;ren sie nie losgelaufen. Lasst euch &uuml;berraschen, wie die Chronomaster spannende neue Ideen in das Spiel bringen und dabei in gewohnter Tsukuyumi-Manier das Spiel erg&auml;nzen und ver&auml;ndern.<br/><br/>Diese Fraktion ist wie immer mit allen bisher erschienen Expansions kombinierbar und enth&auml;lt auch Karten f&uuml;r den 2-Spielermodus, 5 Fraktionsereigniskarten und das allseits beliebte Maskottchen.<br/><br/>Zwei Jahre vor dem Mondfall wurde ein Raumschiff mit einem experimentellen Antrieb getestet. Nur sechs Jahre sp&auml;ter kehrte dieses Schiff zur Erde zur&uuml;ck, an Bord hochentwickelte Affen - die Urenkel der sechs Affen, welche darauf trainiert worden waren, den Antrieb zu testen.<br/>Drei Generationen sp&auml;ter reiste das Schiff, welches das Schwarze Loch - die Quelle des Antriebs - erschaffen hatte erneut durch Raum und Zeit und kehrte zur Erde zur&uuml;ck. Das Schiff wurde nun von 40 Affen bev&ouml;lkert, welche das Schiff in eine gro&szlig;e Raumarche umgebaut hatten. Sie werden zur&uuml;ck auf die Erde kommen, um sie vor dem zu retten, was in der Zukunft lauert. Hierf&uuml;r gibt es nur ein kleines Zeitfenster, da es auf der Erde unter Tonnen von Sand bereits ein Wrack ihrer Arche gibt.<br/><br/>Die Chronomaster sind hier um die Erde vor der Zukunft zu sch&uuml;tzen, ausgestattet mit Hochtechnologie und dem Wissen &uuml;ber die Dinge, welche noch kommen werden.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (German)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Kartini - From Darkness to Light, you manage schools for girls where girls from different islands of Indonesia come to be students. As they graduate, the students become politicians, fighters, patrons or teachers, further advancing education for women and supporting the fight for the nation&rsquo;s freedom. Strategically manage your duits (money) and books to help as many girls graduate from your school while paying attention to your school&rsquo;s reputation. After three rounds, the player with the highest points wins the game.<br/><br/>Kartini - From Darkness to Light celebrates the triumphs of girls&rsquo; education. The game takes place in Indonesia in the late 1800 to the early 1900, during the country&rsquo;s struggle for independence from Dutch colonialism. This was the era where Indonesian young women were stepping up to the plate, leading battles and participating in politics for a free Indonesia.<br/>Realizing that the key to the nation&rsquo;s eventual liberation lied in education, some of them built schools and advocated for more and more girls to be educated to then participate in the nation&rsquo;s fight for freedom. Indonesian women&rsquo;s yearning for education and to take an active role in the public life were encapsulated in a famous series of letters written by Kartini, a Javanese aristocrat, to her Dutch friends. These letters were later published as a book titled &lsquo;From Darkness to Light&rsquo; from which the name of this game derived. Kartini&rsquo;s letters are often credited as one of the cornerstones of Indonesian women emancipation movement and they served as profound inspirations for Indonesia&rsquo;s fight for independence.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the website:<br/><br/>Inside Blitz is a football simulation like no other.  After playing many others in my life I set out to take all the good and get rid of all the bad I saw in those games.  That along with some innovative game play makes this game something special.  The game play is simple yet captures every aspect of the game of football.  Players perform just like they did in the season recreated.  Using a combination of Fast Action Cards and dice plays develop using the personnel on the field.  Your linemen can get called upon to make a play, the defensive secondary may have to stop the run or your linebackers may have to break up a pass.  If it is inside the game of football it is in Inside Blitz.<br/><br/>With defensive players rated in 7 categories, you can see the strengths and weaknesses of all the players.  From coverage skills in four depths of passes to their run defense you will see the weak links.  Not all pass rushers and ball hawking DBs were created the same and here you will see who those players are.<br/><br/>Linemen, receivers and runners are rated for run and pass blocking.   Your sieve of an offensive line will allow more pressure while those staunch linemen will protect your QB like Fort Knox.  You will see the blockers blast running lanes or fail to get room for your runners.<br/><br/>Quarterbacks have 4 different throwing depths so the deep ball guys will perform as such.  Those dump off guys will get their shots downfield but when pressured they will look to their comfort dink passes. The pass rush and scrambling system can really bring out the anticipation of those type plays as well.<br/><br/>Receivers are rated for pass catching ability in three depths down the field.  All receivers have their own 6x6 cards for each depth of pass with the ability to bust one for a longer gain if they can get loose.<br/><br/>Runners are rated for inside and outside running making each runner completely different.  Along with each players own 6x6 card for each type of run you will see where the home-run-hitter type runners will get the all or nothing yards while your consistent bull of a back will get his yards no matter but don&rsquo;t expect a big one.<br/><br/>You have never seen a solitaire system like this one!  Play calling takes into account down, distance and the style of play of both the offense and defense.  Using all this also gets defensive platoons into the game without any hassle on the gamers part.  The distribution of who gets the ball is taken care of with ease.  You won&rsquo;t be seeing a bomb to your clod-footed TE but your track star will be targeted more often at that depth.<br/><br/>Special teams, penalties and propensity to fumble are not overlooked in this game.  Each coverage team is given ratings to reflect the way they played on the season.  Teams are rated separately for penalties which is a very important aspect of football that gets glossed over with many games.  Finally each player is given their own fumble rating to show how each player took care of the ball.<br/><br/>All this is presented in a professional and quality way making Inside Blitz the game of the new generation.  Come on inside!<br/><br/>",

In the main game mode, players select one deck, then draft a complementary team of creatures, items, and spells before doing battle in the arena.<br/><br/>Each creature you summon has unique abilities based on the twenty Aztec Daysigns, e.g., Eagle allows your creatures to fly one lane over to attack, Jaguar allows shifting one lane before attacking, and Snake allows eating defeated Nawals to absorb their powers.<br/><br/>Nawals can be combined together to create a hybrid creature with more health, power, and both sets of abilities. Shapeshifting a Nawal restores its life completely, so finish off your opponent's wounded creatures to avoid giving them a powerful play.<br/><br/>",

At the end of the game, players form Duchies out of the territory they've conquered to score points.  Bonuses are earned by forming Duchies that have one of each Unit, one of each land type, or both.  In addition, proximity to the center of the board is rewarded by an additional bonus.

If you have that game, just print out these components and you can play Buck Rogers 2.0.<br/><br/>It is a game of conquest set in the inner solar system in the 25th century; the board features the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, along with the Asteroid belt.  Players build armies and space fleets and struggle to control these territories; whoever has the most territory at game end wins.<br/><br/>Each player controls a character from the Buck Rogers universe, who grants the pieces around him or her special abilities.  These special powers will often dictate that player's strategy.<br/><br/>Each game turn begins with each player bidding for turn order and then building new units.  They can build these units at factories, and can also buy mercenaries from the black market.  They can build ground units, which are vital for controlling planets, and spaceships which are necessary for traveling from one world to another.<br/><br/>Then, in turn order each player moves his or her units; they may move as many or as few of their units as they like.  At the end of this phase, combat will occur if any player's units are in the same zone as another's, though combat can happen during movement if one player tries to move units through or out of a zone containing enemy units.<br/><br/>In combat, units are moved to a &quot;battle board&quot; which allows the players to make tactical choices for their units.  The front section is the &quot;battle line&quot; where units may fire but are vulnerable to enemy fire, while the rear section is the &quot;reserve line,&quot; where units may not fire but are protected from enemy fire by units in the battle line.  Each unit has a set of numbers it needs to roll on a d10 in order to hit; which number it needs depends on the unit it is firing at.  Once only units from one faction remain the battle is over.<br/><br/>Once all battles are complete, if no player has won the game the planets and asteroids all move forward one zone in orbit around the sun.  Since different planets complete orbits in different amounts of time, players need to watch for &quot;conjunctions&quot; where planets are close to one another and the opportunity exists for players to move from one planet to another quickly.<br/><br/>Changes to the original game include:<br/><br/>     Balanced Leader Abilities<br/>     9 new leaders - including 3 from the 1930's serial films <br/>     Turn order decided by bidding instead of randomly<br/>     Expanded Territory-Based Black Market Production <br/>     Use of the Cards During the Game (not just for setup)<br/>     Expanded Pass-through Fire Rules<br/>     The Tactical Battle Board for Combat<br/>     Offensive Gennie Variant (no more gennie turtling!)<br/><br/><br/>Upgrades:<br/><br/>    Buck Rogers: Battle for the 25th Century Game<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the PLAAY.COM website:<br/><br/>On the heels of the success of SECOND SEASON Pro Football Game comes it's Canadian football counterpart: COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game! It's the most realistic and excitingly detailed  simulation of the Canadian pro game that's ever been created!<br/><br/>With COLD SNAP, you can bring back &quot;the good old days&quot; of Canadian pro football, or, re-live last year's exciting pro season! ANY time is &quot;football season&quot; when you've got a copy of COLD SNAP on your game shelf! YOU call the plays, YOU set the defensive alignments, YOU decide who to bring in when a star player goes down with an injury. Think you can do a better job with your favorite Canadian pro team than the real-life coach did? Well, now you can find OUT! (HINT: you might just gain a new respect for the real-life coach!)<br/><br/>Recent years have seen a glut of new football games hit the market. Many of them are very good. But two key differences make COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game stand out above the crowd of pro football simulation board games...<br/><br/>FIRST, this is a pro football game where EVERY player on the field matters. In many other games, defenders and linemen are treated almost as an afterthought--some games don't even rate them at ALL! But in COLD SNAP, the success or failure of a play most often HINGES on the performance of these players! Yes, the star Canadian passers and runners will stand out on your table-top--but so will the star interior linemen, linebackers and defensive backs! It's exciting to watch!<br/><br/>SECOND, the COLD SNAP results book is cleverly designed to tell you not only WHAT happens on every play, but also WHY! Other games might tell you, for example, that the quarterback just threw an incomplete pass--and that's all the information you get. However, the COLD SNAP results book will tell you whether the incompletion was the result of great coverage by a defensive back, a hurried throw thanks to a missed block by an offensive lineman, a wrong pass route run by the receiver, or any of a multitude of other possible reasons! You'll know what DID happen, AND what MIGHT have happened, if not for the play made or NOT made. It's just like watching pro football on TV, with the game book serving as your color commentator!<br/><br/>COLD SNAP Canadian Pro Football simulation board game is incredibly detailed, yet easy to play. The offense coach chooses a ball carrier or intended receiver for one of six basic offense plays, while the defense coach secretly decides on one of four basic color-coded defense settings. (You can play solitaire, too--there are rules included for that!) Roll the dice, look up the result in the game book, record the gain or loss, and move on to the next play! It's that simple!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Panzer Grenadier: Nihon Silk<br/><br/>After observing German successes in early 1940 with parachute drops, the warriors of Nihon (Japan) ignited their own airborne program. In keeping with their traditional rivalry, the Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army competed against each other with equivalent paratroop formations. These lightly armed parachute units were intended to assault coastal areas, support amphibious landings or seize enemy airfields and other strategic objectives. They were not meant to become entangled in heavy, pitched land battles. However, their operational use would prove to be contrary to this doctrine.<br/><br/>Nihon Silk is a supplement for the Panzer Grenadier system from designer Jay Townsend. It takes players from early 1942 through late summer of 1945, as numerous Allied nations tackle the Japanese paratroopers. And for you tank aficionados, we&rsquo;ve included the battle of San Manuel in the Philippines in 1945. This supplement also adds 165 fabulous new playing pieces and markers to your Panzer Grenadier fun! That&rsquo;s right &mdash; Dutch troops and tankettes, Japanese tanks and other armored vehicles, airfield and oil refinery markers, and even an Australian Brigadier (in shorts, of course)! Nihon Silk requires ownership of Kokoda Trail, Road to Berlin, Battle of the Bulge, Guadalcanal and Afrika Korps to play.<br/><br/>",

With this formidable weapon, the Axis Heavy Antitank Grenadiers are deadlier than ever.<br/><br/>The Heavy Antitank Grenadiers share a single base and come with a special card with three health boxes, like on a hero card. This single expansion comes with options for two separate unit configurations.<br/><br/>",

Game play is scenario-driven, with a modular &quot;board&quot; of hex tiles created as per the scenario set up rules.<br/><br/>The specific game objective depends on the scenario, but generally requires the players to do one of the following within a specified number of game rounds:<br/><br/>- Shoot the biggest buck<br/>- Shoot a specific buck<br/>- Shoot the most deer or most total points in bucks<br/><br/>Players control Hunter characters as their game personas. Six pre-generated characters are included as well as blank cards for  people to create their own. Each Hunter character is rated 1 to 5 on six different attributes. Event cards and player actions will test the skills of each Hunter character.<br/><br/>On their turn, players execute two actions from among nine different choices. The players are attempting to find a good hunting area while increasing their rating on the Deer Encounter Meter, which is a measure of progress toward finding where the deer are located. Eventually, players will execute Hunt actions in the hopes of seeing deer. Once a player determines that deer are present, the deer need to be identified and brought in close enough for a shot. As the deer move closer and the encounter continues, the alertness level of the deer will generally begin to increase as they sense danger nearby. If the players aren't careful, the deer may flee and ruin their chances for a shot.<br/><br/>Players have to manage their Energy levels, items, Hunter cards and save up for bonuses while staying aware of what the other players are doing and attempt to blunt their efforts where possible.<br/><br/>",

Not so in Japan. The Japanese military and civilians fought back with intractable resolve, and saved their greatest city: Tokyo. And when the war ended with a human victory, the Japanese people rebuilt more quickly than anyone else.<br/><br/>With the formation of the United Globe government, and banning of advanced robots, Japan quickly retooled their industrial efforts to genetics. Today, there are hundreds of gene-tech labs in the Tokyo Metrofecture (TMF). But it was the megacorporation Honshu Tek that first engineered the Katanas team genetic template.<br/><br/>Tapping into their rich history, Honshu Tek created a team of samurai-themed athletes that quickly became the most popular team in the TMF. Now, with many years of strong performances, the Katanas frequently break into the playoffs and have more than one championship trophy hanging in their dojo.<br/><br/>Attack your opponents, repeatedly. With three skilled butchers, you should concentrate on weakening opposing teams from round one. Get your butchers and slashers into the center so they can use their mobility and power to dominate your opponents. Be sure to set up field coverage with your butchers. Their automatic carve skill can really block off entire slices of the pit. No one wants to run around those guys. After you&rsquo;ve thinned out your opponents, you can have your razor snag the lonely ball and start scoring goals.<br/><br/>",

All four districts contain three territories each. These territories, in addition to the central territory and four beach territories, make up the entirety of Pimp Island. America&rsquo;s Next Top Pimp is a dangerous game of manipulation. Be wary of other pimps trying to take control of the island. The power of your hoes may not suffice. You must use the Police, Cardinals, Drugs and other manipulative measures if you want a chance at victory and complete control of Pimp Island!<br/><br/>America's Next Top Pimp is played over a few or several pimp rounds. During each pimp round, one or more pimp fights will occur. When all but one player has played their last card, new cards will be drawn and a new pimp round will begin. At the beginning of each fight, the player with the fight marker will place it on a territory of his/her choosing. This will be the location for the next fight.<br/><br/>Players begin each round with 10 cards each (8 in a 2 or 3 player game.)<br/><br/>During a fight, players take turns placing cards in front of them, forming their pimp hand. A player&rsquo;s pimp hand shows the value he/she will bring to the fight. When all players finish placing cards, the fight is over. The player with the highest total value in his/her pimp hand controls the territory. A new territory is chosen and another fight takes place.<br/><br/>In a game of 2 or 3 players, the first player to control four territories that all touch each other or 5 total territories wins the game. In a game of 4, 5, 6, 7 or 8 players, the first player to control an entire district, four territories that touch each other or 5 total territories wins the game.<br/><br/>",

They move swiftly across the table, they fight with frightening speed and lethal skill, and they die abruptly.<br/><br/>An advanced D10 system is coupled with an innovative Influence mechanic to simulate the powers of the Dark Council upon their unwitting pawns. Players must choose how they will gamble with the power of their patrons: spread the Influence throughout a turn, hoping to ease destiny onto a brighter path, or hold the influence, to be entirely cast upon one roll of the dice?<br/><br/>Wild West Exodus is a 35mm steampunk miniatures game set in the Wild West of America and is an action packed game of gunslingers, lawmen, outlaws, mad scientists, aliens and more!<br/><br/>This smart boxed set includes a rulebook, tokens, templates, dice and the Action and Adventure card decks.

The player moves around the board and hunts deer by playing cards from their hand to take actions and deploy useful items. Once deer are spotted, cards are used to try and identify the deer while remaining hidden from their keen senses. If a suitable target is identified and the deer haven't detected the hunter and run away, the player can then take a shot. Dice are used to resolve checks for hunting, identifying, hiding, and shooting.<br/><br/>The scenario will specify the set up for the modular board as well as the goal of the game. The player's goal will typically involve bagging the largest buck possible before their deck runs out thereby ending the game.<br/><br/>This game is by the same designer as Whitetail Wilderness but is a wholely separate game sharing only the title.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Imperial Bayonets: We Were Not Cowards - Sedan 1870&quot; is an operational wargame simulation of the last battle of the Second Empire. It uses a rules-engine heavily inspired by The Library of Napoleonic Battles rules system by the illustrious Kevin Zucker and OSG. Several scenarios allow for a quicker French response to Prussian maneuvers the day before creating a salvageable situation for the French. Each hex is approximately 1KM and units are divisions which can break down into their subordinate brigades. Maintaining a chain of command allows players to freely act with their units, while units outside of command range must rely on initiative. Special rules are included for French Chassepot and Mitrailleuse and the obliterating power of Prussian Krupp artillery.<br/><br/>This is our first wargame outside of the 2140 series and is the first of several efforts to see games our heroic CEO designed a few years ago that have sat languishing among other ideas, priorities and projects. This will include a 22x34&rdquo; map, 560 half inch counters, several player aids along with a rule-book and 2d6.<br/><br/>",

Rumor has it that at the heart of these lost mines lies an even more precious secret: The Eternal Forge, a dwarven masterpiece capable of crafting legendary artifacts. Glory-seeking explorers and wealth-hungry plunderers are already flocking to the mine's entrance to get their hands on this bounty... but the task won't be easy, as Kobolds have taken up residence in these tunnels, sparking a frantic race among rival adventurer teams.<br/><br/>In Forgeflame, you lead a team of 3 adventurers racing to explore mines, collect ores, and craft artifacts. At the start, players shuffle their adventurers' basic cards and take turns playing one card, using their character's unique abilities. After four cards each, they add an advanced card from their characters to create a more powerful deck and draw a new hand.  As the game progresses, unexpected events unfold, and kobolds relentlessly harass the adventurers. Victory requires smart planning, teamwork, and clever tactics. The game ends when a player forges their fourth artifact, and points are tallied.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One Helluva Fight: The Battle of Medjez-el-Bab, December 6-10, 1942. One Helluva Fight is a low to moderate complexity wargame on the Battle of Medjez-el-Bab, fought in northern Tunisia. The Allied landings in Morocco and Algeria ushered in the collapse of the Vichy government in France, and a dramatic strategic shift in the war in Northern Africa. With Rommel&rsquo;s Army in full retreat following battles around El Alamein, the Allies had the opportunity to completely cut-off all Axis forces in North Africa, provided the vital port of Tunis could be taken quickly.<br/><br/>The first major engagement fought by the Anglo-American forces of the war occurred near the crucial crossroads town of Medjez-el-Bab. A British and American battle group, named Blade Force and composed of units from the US 1st Armored and British 78th Infantry divisions as well as some former Vichy French units, initially took the town and then drove on to Tebourba to come within striking distance of Tunis (forward observers could actually see the minarets of the distant port). The Germans, however, cobbled together a battle group of their own, centered on the newly arrived 5th Fallschirmjager Regiment (a unit initially detailed to attack Malta) and 10th Panzer Division. Supported by Luftwaffe and Italian Bersaglieri units, a no-holds-barred tank and infantry fight was fought in which the Allies were thrown back. Can you do as well or better?<br/><br/>Each copy of One Helluva Fight is composed of the following:<br/><br/>&bull;    Two 11 by 17 inch hex map sheets that include the game charts and tables<br/>&bull;    264 single-sided, un-mounted counters<br/>&bull;    8 pages of rules<br/><br/>Units are mostly companies, each turn represents 8 hours of time and  a hex is approximately a half mile across. The game is designed by Paul Rohrbaugh with graphics by Ilya Kudriashov. The game uses a chit-pull activation design by which the sequence of play is determined and which units and/or formations can activate. The game is very interactive, easy to learn and fun to play.<br/><br/>",

Later in the war, it was developed into a formidable night fighter, becoming the major night-fighting aircraft of the Luftwaffe. Great Aces that gloriously piloted this aircraft were Fritz Schupp, Georg Christl and G&uuml;nther Radusch.

In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards. This is not a complete game. To play, you must own a WW2 Rules and Accessories Pack or WW2 Starter Set.<br/><br/>Comes in a Schupp version, a Christl version, and a Radusch  version.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Some historical writings cast the war encounters between French and Prussian Troops in 1806 as &ldquo;no contest&rdquo;. These battles are often characterized as the modern system of skirmishers and columns against outdated linear tactics. However recent research has challenged this simplistic view in that Prussia had begun to modernize their infantry tactics and used skirmishers following their conflict with the Revolutionary French Armies.<br/><br/>La Bataille d&rsquo; Halle is such a battle. The French Corps of Bernadotte attacks the Reserve Corps of the Duke of Wurttemberg. The Prussians are defending the Army&rsquo;s line of communication which runs through an important crossing of the River Saale. The roads to both Leipzig and Magdeburg exit from this city and the main Prussian Army is retreating along one of them.  Marshal Bernadotte moves onto the map and attempts to break through in pursuit of that main army. Victory levels are determined based on your ability to better the historical result.<br/><br/>Each 20 minute turn starts with a Command Phase for both sides followed by the French Player sequence and then by the Prussian Player sequence. The sequence includes movement, cavalry charges, fire and melee. During each, morale plays a decisive role. This is a great one player on one player game that can be completed in an afternoon. In addition to the historical game there are two scenarios that vary the orders of battle and appearance times.<br/><br/>The original rules have been updated but not expanded to any extent. The original designers of the La Bataille Series believe the Premier Rules facilitate the most accurate and competitive play. The new Premier Rules are an update of the original  rules but make it easier to find specific topics and includes some user requested rules such as command control.<br/><br/>Marshal Enterprises intends to publish a Napoleonic Grand Tactical Game every quarter. The games are free by down loading all the required documents at our website. Each specific title will have a Special Rules Package.  Options include printing the map as a series of 11&rdquo;x17&rdquo; pages or as a one piece file. Instructions are included to make the unit and informational counters.

They were armed with 30 36-Pounder guns in the lower deck, 32 24-Pounder guns in the middle deck, 32 12-Pounder guns in the upperdeck, and 18 8-Pounder guns in the quarterdeck and the forecastle.<br/><br/>Santa Ana was a 112-gun three-decker ship of the line of the Spanish Navy, designed by Romero Landa. This ship was launched on 28 September 1784 and, after a positive test, became the first of her class. Subsequent Spanish three-deckers would be built following the same plans. At Trafalgar, Santa Ana was the flagship of Alava, suffering 97 killed and 141 wounded, with Alava himself seriously wounded. Initially captured by the British, a squadron succeeded in recapturing her two days later and returning her back to Cadiz. In 1810 she was captured again in Avana by the French and sank in its Arsenal in 1816.<br/><br/>This ship pack can also be used to represent the Spanish Meregildos class &quot;Mejicano 1786&quot;.<br/><br/>",

From that moment on, these &quot;Kagoun hunters&quot;, become obsessed with capturing them and uncovering their &quot;mystery.&quot;<br/>The players are these hunters who do everything they can to acquire as many Kagouns as possible, even if it means falling out with their friends. <br/>They have even formed groups to hunt together and invoke them by &quot;sublimating&quot; them and using their &quot;mystical glasses&quot; to attract them. It's teamwork, but not entirely, as nothing prevents a K-hunter from stealing a Kagoun from their neighbor, turning them into adversaries in the end.<br/><br/>On your turn in a round, you can (1) capture cards (free-roaming Kagouns) or (2) discard cards from your hand (Kagoun targets). <br/>You can also (3) pair up the cards you have captured or (3) steal a card from your neighbors or opponents. If you capture cards, <br/>you can have up to 3 pairs of Kagouns in front of you. If you discard, you draw the same number of cards as you discarded. <br/>If you assemble the cards next to each other, following their shapes, you start accumulating points.<br/>To prevent your opponents from progressing faster than you, you must steal cards from them, but they will defend themselves each time without spending their turn's action. <br/>All card placements are done face-down.<br/><br/>Some cards also grant you powers that boost your action on your turn in the round. <br/>To win the game, you must reach 10 assembly points with the bonus point system based on repeating Kagoun symbols. <br/>You must announce &quot;Kagoun!&quot; and if, at the end of the final round, you have the most points, you win.<br/><br/>",

Huge warbeasts stride into battle, tearing enemies apart with tooth and claw, while epic warlocks smite their enemies with ancient spells - in this bitter age of fighting, who will emerge victorious? <br/> The Legion of Everblight inhabit the harsh frozen northern wastes, and have descended upon Immoren - tainting the lands with corruption. The Druids of the Circle Orboros clash with the forces of Everblight in an attempt to halt their spread. <br/> The seemingly unstoppable Kaya the Wildborne leads the Orboros attack, accompanied by her loyal pack of warbeasts - while Lylyth, the Herald of Everblight has called upon her savage Dragonspawn to help her repel this dark foe.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Like a thunderstorm from out of the Alpine foothills, Marshal Wurmser's Austrian army jolted the French advanced guard of General Massena from their entrenched heights on Monte Baldo. Bonaparte summarized the bleak situation: &quot;The enemy have broken through our line in three places; they are masters of La Corona and Rivoli. Massena has been compelled to yield to superior forces; Sauret has begun his retreat to Desenzano, and the enemy has captured Brescia and the bridge of Ponte San Marco. You see that our communications with Milian are cut off.&quot;<br/><br/>Ordering Augereau to join him at Roverbella, Bonaparte directed Serurier to raise the siege of Mantova and fall back, to cover the alternate line of communication via Cremona. Although this meant abandoning the precious siege guns, it gave the French the freedom to unite their forces and engage on their own terms, massing against each Austrian wing in turn.<br/><br/>Staking everything on success, Bonaparte set his forces in motion toward Brescia, leaving a small brigade of 1,500 men at Castiglione to delay three corps of Marshal Wurmser. There was no room for retreat - any reverse would mean utter catastrophe. Bonaparte rode five horses to death, covering 122 kilometers in 42 hours; but the French commander regained the initiative. He routed the Austrians at Lonato, while Wurmser approached Castiglione, a mere five miles away.<br/><br/>Though he succeeded in turning about and driving Wurmser back into the hills, the contest for Italy was far from over; the Austrian Army would return to hurl themselves against the understrength French forces covering the quadrilateral of fortresses - Verona, Legnano, Peschiera, and the ultimate prize - Mantova.<br/><br/>Rules: Napoleon at Bay System (48 pages incl. notes)<br/>Quick Set-up Tables: six 8.5&quot; x 11&quot; Sheets &amp; Displays<br/>Scenarios: Four (July, September, November 1796 and January 1797<br/>Map: One 22 x 34&quot; section by Joe Youst<br/>Counters: 280 (300 including blanks) two-sided pieces by Masahiro Yamazaki<br/>Game Design: Kevin Zucker<br/><br/>GAME SYSTEM: CAMPAIGNS System - Series 1X = 3,200m/hex, 1,000 men/SP, 2 days/turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Until someone seriously gets their game on, the Fishermen&rsquo;s Guild will keep on winning.&rdquo;<br/>&ndash; Flint, Mason&rsquo;s Guild<br/><br/>As a cunning predator, Shark is the kind of captain crowds love to watch and players hate to face because he&rsquo;s aggressively fast. And he&rsquo;s not shy about showing off. Circling the currents of the pitch, his plays aim to shame&mdash;he darts in, steals the ball, and sinks a shot in a flash of blue. Fading back into the murky shadows, he patiently waits to strike again.<br/><br/>Fast, agile, and fragile, his team&rsquo;s playstyle is about outsmarting opponents with clever plays and swfit goals. Led by one of the fastest captains, this team clinches the early game by sinking goals quickly. Coaches who want speed and a kick stronger than the surging tides will find this Fishermen team to be a perfect match.<br/><br/>As unyielding as the seas, this set includes a ball, 6 player cards, bases, and 6 players: Shark, Salt, Angel, Siren, Greyscales, Kraken.<br/><br/>",

The game ends when someone gathers the necessary number of keys, plus 4 cities level 4. Moreover, the game does not end when the map is fully covered.<br/><br/>Alternative win condition - in this game it is not enough to have the most points. Only the players that have gathered all necessary keys can claim the victory - they are the only ones who compare their score.<br/><br/><br/>    NCBC is a collection of mini expansions based on neutral big scale figurines, which are designed to enlarge the immersive Battalia universe, introducing a whole bunch of new strategic possibilities to the players and adding completely new adventure elements to the basically competitive plot. In general they don't belong to any faction (resp. to any player) and can be played in different combinations with the basic game or with the BIG!Expansion. We don't recommend to mix more than 3 different types of NPCs in your games in order to avoid higher complexity. But you can mix them in totally different combinations, which ensures the long-term replaya bility and excitement in this game universe. Normally the NPCs have small complementary rules, which are provided only online on Battalia's home page battalia.eu as high resolution printable PDF files. The miniatures are distributed in small packaging boxes with custom artwork as separate items or possibly in bundles.<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player starts the game in one of six towns around Great Bay. Each town will have its own unique market of available and wanted goods, drawn from a deck of market cards. Players use their money to purchase goods from the markets for delivery to other towns in order to make a profit. Players can also pick up passengers who are looking for transport to other towns.<br/><br/>After loading the goods and passengers onto their gundalow, players roll a die to sail to other towns around Great Bay and the Piscataqua River. The deepwater port of Portsmouth has exotic and highly-profitable goods available (such as spices and cotton) but it&rsquo;s a long journey down the Piscataqua River.<br/><br/>Event cards come into play when players land on the event squares on the game board. Event cards offer new challenges and opportunities to players and will create dynamic and exciting market conditions. Players may need to adjust their trade routes to be successful! Resourcefulness and flexibility are the keys to successfully competing against the other gundalow captains.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player accumulates $100. Players then tally their goods and passengers delivered, and the players with the highest totals receive one or more of several honorary titles and victory cards. Will you earn the coveted &ldquo;Richest Captain&rdquo; honorary title (awarded to the player who accumulates the most money) or perhaps the gratifying &ldquo;Friend to Farmers&rdquo; honorary title (awarded to the player who delivers the most marsh hay).

The other players play as the towns and are on the side of the witches.

The census, the arrival, the journey, and the hunt. These repeat until one side has won. The census phase is the only time where the towns players are able to communicate freely. During the other phases communication is limited.

Are you up to the task? The quest is calling!<br/><br/>HeroQuest Online Quest 2 &ndash; Into the Northlands is a solo quest for any hero. It is designed to prepare them for the powerful threats found in the HeroQuest Frozen Horror Expansion pack. For Zargon players, this quest gives some suggestions and tools to help scale the level of difficulty desired for their game. It also answers some commonly asked questions and provides errata to some game mechanics that felt more unfair than challenging.<br/><br/>This quest includes a set of playtest rules for bringing an animal companion on your solo adventures. A popular archetype in sword and sorcery tales is the friend of beasts. Great cats, horses, hawks, and all manner of small clever critters have a history of thwarting the machinations of foul sorcerers. We wanted to take this opportunity to playtest some new companion rules and tell a story of how your hero first encountered one of these faithful animals on their journey to the frozen north.<br/><br/>The Avalon Hill team uses an alternative to the roll to move mechanic in our playtesting. We included it in this quest so you could try it out! It keeps the drama of rolling double 1s (tripping on a loose dungeon cobblestone) in combat but keeps exploring brisk.<br/><br/>Cast the far voice spell and let us know what you think!&rdquo;<br/><br/>-description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

The game begins with the launching of what turned out to be the last of the Communist strategic-level offensives of the whole war, and ends with the final UN riposte against it. The game therefore requires both players to successfully attack and defend over the course of the game.<br/><br/>Scale. each hex on the map equals 5 miles (8 km) from side to opposite side. each game turn represents 3.5 days (hence the date-overlaps on the Turn Track). Individual playing pieces represent corps, divisions, brigades, regiments and battalions, each containing from about 2,000 to 15,000 men and/or 50 to 400 armored fighting vehicles respectively.<br/><br/>",

Gameplay revolves around a momentum-based system that allows the player with the momentum to continue to take actions until they lose momentum, at which point their opponent picks up and continues.<br/><br/>Players use resources to supply their gladiators with equipment and minions (support characters). The crowd gets involved through cheer and also provides an alternate victory condition. Win the crowd, and you win the game!<br/><br/>Mix and match cards from any Ophidian 2360: Survival of the Fittest decks:<br/><br/>     Ophidian 2360: Survival of the Fittest – Mental Block vs. Warrior's Resolve<br/>     Ophidian 2360: Survival of the Fittest – War Machine vs. Bio-Hazard<br/>     Ophidian 2360: Survival of the Fittest – The Art of War vs. Otherworld Allies<br/><br/><br/>Playing with four players will require a total of four playable decks.<br/><br/>Many character options, 4 different win conditions, and a large number of in-game choices/options makes this a truly unique and engaging game!<br/><br/>",

Players earn these Favor tokens by playing cards which match the Agenda key (e.g, Rebel worlds, or Alien cards). When no more tokens remain, the Agenda activates, allowing players to spend any accumulated Favor tokens for unique benefits.<br/><br/>In addition to the Agenda system, Patronage includes a handful of unique mechanics, including peaceful worlds which can only be settled with a negative total military, powers that let you spend VP chips, and a number of &quot;Intel&quot; powers which grant benefits based on your opponent's tableau and action selection.<br/><br/>",

The game maybe connected to the later Xiangqi, Nyout and some race games like Ashtapada, representing cosmological and religious patterns, used also for divination.<br/><br/>The rules are forgotten, but many pictures and artifacts, even records of single divinations made with the same board, have been found, and there is a playable &quot;reconstructed&quot; version by chess-expert and author Jean-Louis Cazaux <a target='_blank' href=\"http://history.chess.free.fr/liubo-rules.htm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://history.chess.free.fr/liubo-rules.htm</a>.<br/><br/>The board is a square with an unusual pattern of lines and angles on it, equally on each side. There is also a central square. The moves of the six figures (five &quot;pawns&quot; and one &quot;king&quot;) of the two players are determined by throwing marked sticks, probably not by only counting some marks but also interpreting and calculating the throw according to some rules derived from the Yijing.<br/><br/>Winner is the one who captures all of his opponent's stones.<br/><br/>",

Skillfully blending the mechanics of trick-taking games with the world of financial games. You will have to play your hand of cards to obtain the resources you need to make the companies in which you have invested flourish. The game unfolds over 3 years divided into 3 phases:<br/>1. Trick round: win cards that will be used in the following two phases.<br/>2. Operating round: operate your trains through cities to generate income and increase your share values.<br/>3. Stock round: sale and purchase shares in the various companies.<br/><br/>I also invite you to have a look at my &quot;Preamble to 18XX and trick-taking players&quot; (<a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3271780/preamble-18xx-and-trick-taking-players\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/3271780/preamble-18xx-and-t...</a>).<br/><br/>Why the title CityTriXX? <br/>I wanted a title that makes sense and combines several of my passions. First, &laquo;City&raquo; for the beautiful cities and monuments to discover. Then &laquo;Trixx&raquo; for Trick Taking, which brought me joy for years and that I recently rediscovered thanks to my friends. Finally, &laquo;XX&raquo; for my economic games with stocks and trains, such as the 18XX series. I also liked the similarity in sound to the word CityTrip, which invites to travel and exploration. I hope this game brings you as much pleasure as I had in creating it and playing it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Not just any group of gung-ho 'Mech jocks can survive in the cutthroat world of the mercenary, and any MechWarrior  who ignores this fact ends up working for someone else, Dispossessed, or dead. Running a successful merc unit takes know-how, skill, careful planning, and sometimes a little luck. If you still think you've got what it takes to pit your skills against the fiercest warriors of the Inner Sphere and beyond, The Mercenary's Handbook: 3055  is for you. The handbook provides a comprehensive, detailed system for creating, maintaining, and operating a mercenary unit in the BattleTech universe, covering every aspect if the mercenary life from combat to salary to medical care.<br/><br/>The Mercenary's Handbook: 3055 also includes detailed briefings on five of the most renowned mercenary units of the Inner Sphere: Wolf's Dragoons, the Kell Hounds, Rhonda Snord's Irregulars, the Gray Death Legion, and the Black Thorns. So what are you waiting for? C-bills and glory await any MechWarrior bold enough to take them. But just remember, the battle's not over until the check clears...&quot;<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>Although this book was ostensibly published with the MechWarrior RPG audience in mind, for anyone looking to run an extended BattleForce or BattleTech campaign involving a mercenary unit as the central protagonist, this BattleTech sourcebook is a font of useful information, and provides a great set of rules for managing a Mercenary unit. Admittedly, it involves a fair amount of record keeping, or someone with an enthusiasm for spreadsheet manipulation, but it's the sort of book that's bound to appeal to players looking for realistic campaigns, and the book provides a natural progression route for those moving on from pick-up games and scenario packs.<br/><br/>The Mercenary's Handbook: 3055 is now out of print, and the current licence holder hasn't announced any intention to reprint it. It's also not available in an electronic format, but the earlier BattleTech: 2nd Edition Mercenary's Handbook is available electronically and has been for some time, so there's hope that this sourcebook might become available eventually.<br/><br/>",

Players deploy worker ants on an abstracted hex-area map to look for and forage food. Colonies use food to produce more workers to produce more food, etc. Eventually colonies grow large enough to produce reproductive male and female ants. Players score points for each reproductive ant released during a nuptial flight.<br/><br/>A deck of cards provide environmental events and different genetic traits for the various ant species. Conflict between colonies is possible but is not the primary focus of the game. All events, traits, and general game play are based on the natural history of actual ant species.<br/><br/>Hidden Empires II is a major update to Hidden Empires and includes a larger map, less random traits, and clearer rules divided into basic, advanced and optional sections.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1st of November 866AD, All Saints Day in the Northumbrian City of Eoforwic (Yorvik in Danish), would have been a hive of activity as the good folk went about their lives drawn to the Mynster for the feast of All the Saints and the last market fair before winter. Little did they realize the great calamity about to enter their lives, as outside the gates was a wolf, Ivar the Boneless (son of Ragnar). Standing over seven foot tall, a great warrior and military tactician but also a tyrant, Ivar was the cruel and ruthless leader of the mycel heathern here, or Great Heathen Army.<br/><br/>Ivar, with his brothers Ubbe &amp; Halfdan, along with their army arrived from Ireland years earlier. After landing in East Anglia in 865 AD they demanded and received Danegeld in the form of horses and supplies from King Edmund and the East Angles. The Vikings now had mobility by land and sea. Their target was Northumbria, and the domination of this northern kingdom with its superior river and road networks that linked Yorvic and Dublin to the Scandinavian homeland.<br/><br/>Northumbria in 866 was in a state of savage civil war. Osberht, the rightful King of Northumbria, had been deposed by Aella and a battle for control of Northumbria raged. Into this vacuum entered Ivar and his army. Chaos reigned as Ivar and the Viking Hordes began to launch attacks throughout Deira, looting, pillaging and killing in what could only have been a strategic plan by Ivar to weaken, subdue, cower, and splinter his enemies.<br/><br/>By March of 866 The rival Northumbrian Kings had reached a tacit agreement to stop their civil war to march on the Vikings and take back their kingdom. Although weakened by civil war, it also meant that the warriors of these Saxon lands were battle hardened, well trained and in such numbers that a full frontal assault against the Vikings at Yorvic was planned. For a short period it looked like Saxon success was theirs&rsquo; for the taking. But Ivar had arranged his defenses with all the cunning of an Alpha Wolf and the Saxons were defeated and King Alle would suffer the gruesome Ritual of the Blood Eagle.<br/><br/>Ivar the Boneless is as much a strategic as tactical game. While there will be pitched battles both players will have to make decisions as to when and where to fight, and how best to maximize your strengths, whether Viking or Saxon.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You take it up from the sand and shout: &ldquo;I found a magic lamp!&rdquo; All your friends look at you cleaning the lamp from the sand when a small blue genie appears out.<br/>&ldquo;Finally someone found me!&rdquo; The genie says.<br/>&ldquo;Do I have three wishes?&rdquo; You ask.<br/>&ldquo;Ehm ... not exactly ... all of you will have to choose between 3 wishes&rdquo;. Answer the genie.<br/>&ldquo;Wow&rdquo; you all say excited.<br/>&ldquo;But I will propose the wishes and only one of you will get his wish true.&rdquo; Clarify the genie.<br/>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; You want to know.<br/>&ldquo;The winner of this game. Do you want to play?&rdquo; Is the answer of the genie.<br/><br/>Tres Deseos (Three Wishes) is a family voting game. Every turn 3 different wish cards are revealed. One player is asked to choose among them and other players guess on his preferences.<br/><br/>The game runs over several &ldquo;turns&rdquo;. Every turn is composed by 4 steps: <br/>1. Reveal Wish Cards. The current player draws 3 wish cards. He reads the cards and explains them if necessary. Every card shall be interpreted in the most marvelous way. The player is not allowed to express any preference on the cards at this point. <br/>2. Place Bets. All the player place secretly their betting cards.<br/>3. Express Preference. The player with the turn card now has to express his preferences for the favorite wish and the less favorite wish. He can justify his decision if necessary, but he cannot change it. <br/>4. Assign Points. Finally, the players show up their bets and receive 1 point for each right guessing. The current player receives 1 point for each player that guesses both bets.<br/><br/>The number of turns to be played depends on the number of players. At the end of the game the player who scored the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this horror/dark fantasy solitaire card game with a philosophical/mystical story, a player represents a soul trying to break free from the cycle of nightmarish incarnations by enduring the right sequence of them, building an octave from cosmic tones, and getting to the higher, more peaceful level of being. He or she chooses from different cards with letters from A to G, depending on how much hostile each card is and if it fits the sequence he or she has already built. Every card represents an incarnation of the soul into a nightmarish life and the soul must endure them.<br/><br/>Each card harms the player in a different way and works with the pile or his hand in a different way depending on simple symbols with numbers on the cards (resources are: willpower, represented by a counter card to be covered by another card; and a number of the cards in the pile). There are also &quot;keepers&quot; in the game, tough bosses that prevent you from achieving your goal. The game is balanced in such a way, that usually loss lies very close to winning, and winning is quite hard (easy to play, hard to win). The game setting is just a few seconds  (setting only four &quot;desperate cry&quot; cards that can help you in desperate situations during the game; 1 willpower counter card; and shuffling the pile) and each game is only 10-30 minutes.<br/><br/>The game mechanism is based on using cards with the same letters or symbols (besides a letter, each card has a symbol or set of symbols too) to recycle them if you do not need the particular card at the moment or if you even need to get rid of it (in case of the keepers).<br/><br/>It consists of 40 full-colored cards, with a focus on dark art. No other components needed. The game has its own soundtrack in the Dungeon Synth genre.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "June 27, 1898, Baler, Principe District, Luzon Island (Philippines). With the arrival of the Filipino insurgents from the Katipunan and in the midst of the Spanish-American War, a Spanish detachment made up of 53 soldiers and the local priest took refuge behind the walls of the town church, remaining completely isolated. Thus began one of the longest sieges in history that lasted 337 days, where the Spanish, despite suffering so many hardships, defended the last Spanish overseas position with great heroism. It would not be until June 2, 1899, when the act of capitulation was signed. Discover and enter a siege so unique to this exciting.<br/><br/>Heroes of Baler <br/>On April 27, the US fleet of the Asiatic Squadron, commanded by Commodore Dewey, left Hong Kong for the Philippines. On May 1, he reached Manila Bay and defeated the Spanish fleet, commanded by Admiral Montojo, resulting in its entirety being sunk. The Cavite arsenal and plaza surrendered to the Americans the next day. The Battle of Cavite marked the beginning of the end of the Spanish presence in the Philippines. On May 19, Aguinaldo returned to the Philippines on a US ship to lead the revolution, which spread throughout the island of Luzon. At the end of May, news reached Baler about the start of the war against the United States and the defeat of the Spanish fleet in Cavite. These were some of the last news received by land from abroad since the rebels prevented the passage of news through the mountains. The Spanish in Baler were completely cut off.<br/><br/>The Filipinos tried at all costs to demonstrate to the Spanish detachment that the war had ended, but despite the numerous attempts at parliament that occurred during the months of siege, the Spanish refused to capitulate and surrender the plaza outright.<br/>After numerous attacks and attempts to take over the church by the Filipinos, it would not be until the morning of June 2 when Mart&iacute;n Cerezo began to reread the newspapers that Aguilar had left behind and those, he thought were Filipino forgeries in order to confuse them. for them to give up. In one of them, he found a small review that made him see that the newspapers were true, as well as his news: he realized that the war was over and that there was no point in continuing to fight. The review, within the section of military destinations, was the announcement of the new destination in Malaga of the lieutenant of the scale of the Infantry reserve Francisco D&iacute;az Navarro. Mart&iacute;n Cerezo had coincided with the officer, of whom he was a close friend, before he was assigned to Cuba. D&iacute;az had told him that at the end of the campaign he planned to request a transfer to the Andalusian capital, where his girlfriend and her family lived, so Mart&iacute;n Cerezo accepted the news as true and, by extension, all the newspapers and news that Aguilar had left for the that finally, that same day, the capitulation of the Spanish detachment took place.<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/>Heroes of Baler is a tactical game where players will take control of one of the two available sides (Spanish or Filipino). Both sides are asymmetrical so that the victory conditions and the way of playing are different for each side. Throughout the game the players (besieger and besieged) will try to achieve victory by carrying out firefights, raids, artillery attacks, repairs, trench construction...<br/>This is a game for 1 to 2 players with a game length within one and two hours. In the two-player game each player will take the role of besieger (Filipino) or besieged (Spanish). In the solitary mode, the player will take the control of the Spanish as besieged faction.<br/> Each game turn represents approximately two months of siege. The main panel represents the town of Baler with the church that the Spanish defended in the center and around it the Filipino bahays and trenches. In addition, the board shows two exclusive areas one for each player.<br/>Based on an game system which mix hand management and action points, the turn begins with the initiative phase where each side will try to seize the initiative in turn order. Next, in turn order the players will play their event phase where they may play up to two event cards and may play support cards to power up the played event(s) if they meet the requirements.

The Mortisan Executioner Mir Kainan was charged with collecting the long-overdue tithe of the Silent People. When they arrived in Beastgrave, Kainan's Reapers found the Silent People had fled, their regular migration cycle interrupted by the mountain's anguished raging. They did not intend to return empty-handed, however. Direchasm's depths held countless ancient bones, and many rival warbands would pay the price for the Silent People's delinquency.<br/><br/>Bringing hitting power, magic, and disposable bone constructs to the living mountain, Kainan's Reapers are an incredibly flexible warband. Emphasise your preferred play style through the use of a range of warband-specific and universal cards, and their new tithe mechanic will help you inspire your warband.

A new card type and god, giant and treasure tokens complete this expansion.<br/><br/>STORY<br/>After the arrival of the Giants, the world of Valda is on the brink of the final confrontation between the Giants and the Gods. Divine blood will flow, Gods will die, empires are about to crumble and Giants shall fall.. The end is near.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY (AND WIN)<br/>In Valda: the Rise of the Giants, you now have a choice between Gods and Giants and their powers to use to your advantage.<br/>When Ragnarok is played with only the base game: every player conducts 5 phases (Resource phase, action phase, building phase, attack phase and follower phase). When playing Ragnarok combined with the base game and Rise of the Giants expansion: every player finishes 4 phases during their turn (Valda phase, attack phase, follower phase and resource phase). <br/>In the attack phase players now can attack the player in turn or attack a God / Giant of choice. Gods and Giants are no longer immortal and untouchable.<br/><br/>The viking chieftan who has the most followers when the ship arrives in Asgard, becomes the new ruler of the 9 worlds!

A knife is unsheathed, and with a few quick movements, the enemy&rsquo;s bloody scalp is ripped free. Warfare in the Eastern Woodlands of America was one of raids, ambushes and sudden violent encounters. These are the skirmishes that Song of Drums and Tomahawks seeks to recreate. The French &amp; Indian War is the most well-known conflict of this period, but these rules cover from the time of the European arrival until the mid-1800s. Players will generally control less than a dozen figures in multiplayer games, perhaps more in one-on-one contests. The fast-paced play, the tense decision making using simple, easy-to-learn rules, will lead to many fun and gripping games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A DIY expansion for the Great War at Sea series that assumes the Civil War had turned out differently.<br/><br/>From the APL website... &quot;When Confederate Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston&rsquo;s Army of Mississippi destroyed the Union&rsquo;s Army of the Tennessee at Shiloh in April 1862, it brought despair to a Northern public already restive over the war&rsquo;s course. A few weeks later the entire world saw how a single Confederate ironclad could isolate the Union&rsquo;s Army of the Potomac on the Virginia Peninsula; the Union ship that might have saved the day, the ironclad Monitor, had been swamped in heavy seas and sank before it could arrive on the scene. With no help of reinforcement, resupply or rescue and Robert E. Lee&rsquo;s Army of Northern Virginia launching incessant attacks, George McClellan surrendered his command. The American Civil War was over after roughly a year of fighting.<br/><br/>Fifty years later, the United States and Confederate States share a divided continent. The South has expanded into the Caribbean Basin and Central America, cutting a canal across Nicaragua and establishing new states and territories. Under pressure from their British and French allies, the Confederate States gradually eliminated slavery, but severe class and racial tensions remain. Northern politicians know talk of re-unification is an easy crowd-pleaser; even the United States Navy continues to name warships for Southern states and cities.<br/><br/>War in Europe has finally brought the long-simmering American feud into open conflict. The United States, pressured by its German allies, seeks to disrupt trade through the Caribbean Basin and deny these resources to the Allied war effort. The Confederacy, outnumbered and outgunned by its rival, must protect its economic lifelines if it is to survive as an independent state.<br/><br/>Confederate States Navy is a supplement for the Great War at Sea series, based on battles that never happened, waged by a fleet that never existed. It is not a complete game: Ownership of U.S. Navy Plan Gold is necessary to play most of the 10 scenarios included and Jutland, Pacific Crossroads, Mediterranean, Sea of Troubles and Black Waters to play all of them.<br/><br/>Confederate States Navy is sold exclusively via .pdf download. The playing pieces are not die-cut and mounted, nor is the scenario book printed. Instead it comes as a series of .pdf files that will need to be assembled into the game&rsquo;s components.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Siege Master is a two-player abstract strategy game of continental conquest. To set up, players create a map-like shape on a hexagonal grid, then they alternate placing an odd number of neutral fortresses on hexes within this map such that most fortresses are at least three spaces from all other fortresses. The variability of map shapes makes every game a new challenge.<br/><br/>Each player takes a matching set of army tokens and fortress tokens; an army token covers four empty hexes in a row (1x4). Players are trying to capture neutral fortresses, and they do so if the fortress is in an area of zero or more empty hexes that is surrounded by army tokens, the edge of the grid, or both and if no armies can fit into this area. When this happens, the capturing player replaces the neutral fortress with one of his own color.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, if the player's opponent did not capture a fortress on his previous turn and it is possible to play an army adjacent to the opponent's previously placed army, then the moving player must do so. Otherwise, the active player can play an army token anywhere on the map. (A swap rule applies after the first turn; when swapping, all tokens played by the first player on his first turn are replaced by the second player's tokens.)<br/><br/>The player who captures more than half of the fortresses on the map wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After Alfred and Guthrum had arranged a truce at Exeter and with Guthrum retreating back into Mercia (Vol. 2). Alfred must have assumed that the West Saxons could once again to look forward to a prolonged period of peace. But within five months Guthrum had reinforced his army and on the twelfth night, while the Saxons celebrated there holy period, Guthrum and his Viking Allies launched a surprise attack at Alfred's Royal estate at Cippanhamm. Through good intelligence, good fortitude and/or plain good luck Alfred was able to escape and with a handful of followers made his way to the marshes of the Somerset Levels.<br/>It is here in the most inhospitable of conditions of sea-flooded swamp that Alfred, with a handful of followers, was to make a seemingly impregnable fortress at Althelney. It was from that King Alfred was to launch a guerilla campaign against his Viking tormentors. Within five months the King's forces defeated the Viking Army of Guthrum in a pitched battle at Ethandun.<br/>Though Alfred entered the marsh with a small number of loyal followers we also know that he was not completely without allies. Odda Ealdorman of Devonshire was protecting Athelney by controlling the River Perret from Cynuit Hillfort, and was to do battle there with the legendary Ubbe Lothbrok (son of Ragnar) Alfred also had the support of Ealdorman of Somerset, Aethelnoth, who had also been fighting the Vikings from the Somerset levels. Aethelnoth's support was in no doubt instrumental in helping Alfred regroup and plan his campaign to reclaim Wessex.<br/>Not all of Alfred's Earls were as loyal as Odda and Aethelnoth, and in this game the Saxons of Wiltshire are in a state of civil war with their warriors split between loyalty for their King and a Saxon controlled Wessex. It is there that the treacherous Ealdorman, Wulfhere, gained control and sided with the Viking invaders.<br/>The Viking strength was in their professional and aggressive soldiery skills. Their weaknesses were often in the re-supply of fighting men and the fact the West Saxons were fighting for their home.<br/>Kings are of great importance in this series of games. When they are leading the warriors in combat your moral and thereby fighting ability is increased, without them weakened. Of course the loss of a King in battle can also mean the loss of your cause.

The game can rely on three great features: amazing miniatures, an original and extremely competitive gameplay, historical accuracy at its highest level for what concerns this specific topic.<br/><br/>The game is divided into rounds. To begin with, each player must select which cards (minimum 1) they will play during the current round. Each card represents specific moves and maneuvers the gladiators can perform. The original FightHex System integrates all the information about orientation, armor and view directly on the miniatures' bases!<br/><br/>The round begins: the players must choose, alternatively, which move their gladiators will perform, trying their best to predict and counter the opponent's movements. At the end of each round all cards will be refreshed.<br/><br/>As soon as two miniatures are engaged, combat begins! Use Combat tiles to Defend or Attack a specific area of your opponent: block enemy attacks and penetrate their guard. In this phase, predicting where your opponent is going to hit and where they will block is essential! If your opponent's Defense tile does not match your Attack tile... your attack is a success, pull out a Damage token from the bag!<br/><br/>The Summa Rudis tracks Crowd Favor. Both if you penetrate the enemy's guard or block their attacks, move it towards your side. You win immediately if the Summa Rudis reaches the last space on your side of the track, or if at the end of the 15th round the Summa Rudis is on your side of the track!<br/><br/>The game can be played in two modes: Duel (1 Vs 1) and Melee (1 to 6 players). Moreover, each type of gladiator has four experience levels featuring special moves and techniques!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game was developed in cooperation with professional firefighters and it includes realistic situations and educational content.<br/><br/>Fire Brigade is a cooperative game. Players are members of the fire brigade. Their goal is to save citizens by rescuing and transporting them from endangered areas to the hospital. At the same time, they want to prevent buildings from burning down and keep the fire contained by preventing the spread of a raging inferno. This game can be played in two modes. In Normal Mode players try to save as many citizens as they can, while in Expert Mode they must save all of the citizens or they lose the game.<br/><br/>The board consists of hexes with different areas (grass, forest, wetlands etc.) with drier areas having more chances to catch on fire. Buildings, Citizens and Fire Tokens are placed on the board according to the chosen scenario. There are nine scenarios for different number of players and difficulties.<br/><br/>Each player gets a Squad Card along with the matching Fire Truck Miniature and Starting Hex and is assigned one random Firefighting Ability Card and one random Utility Ability Card. That gives each Squad unique abilities to achieve the given goals easier.<br/><br/>The game has multiple rounds, each following the same procedure. Each round is divided into three phases: Fire-spreading Phase, Event Phase and Players&rsquo; Actions Phase.<br/><br/>In the Fire-spreading Phase the first player rolls the two Fire Dice. The sum of both numbers determines which hexes will be additionally affected by fire this turn. The fire intensifies and spreads according to the dice roll. If the fire intensifies too much, the Fire Tokens are replaced with an Inferno Token. Buildings on those hexes have burned to the ground and the Citizens are lost.<br/><br/>Then comes the Event Phase which changes the situation on the board. Events can be positive, negative or both.  There is an interesting fact about firemen and fire at the bottom of each event card.<br/><br/>The last phase is the Players&rsquo; Actions Phase. When it is their turn, each player can perform any combination of three basic actions (i.e. has three action points) and any number of free actions. The basic actions are: move Fire truck, extinguish fire, use Firefighting ability, use Utility ability, repair the Fire Truck, and evacuate Citizens. The free actions are: drop off Citizens in the Hospital and get Motivation Card, use Motivation card, drop off Citizens temporarily and pick them up after being dropped off. Players can pass at any point of their turn.<br/><br/>At the End of the game, players can check how well they did. Points are awarded based on how well the fire was contained and how many buildings were burned down. The score is then compared to the Score table which places players in categories from one to five stars, with stars being lost for every lost Citizen. By calculating their score, the players see how well they did and take a scenario with higher or lower difficulty, or try to beat their score in the same scenario next time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These warrior-athletes have an explosive blend of agility, tactical skill, and violence that makes their game exciting to watch, with an acrobatic style honed by years of running through the thick rainforest to escape superpredators. With tactics inspired by the most dangerous animals in their native jungles, these players apply harassment maneuvers that dazzle Blood Bowl fans and opponents alike.<br/><br/>On the field, the Amazon teams are a force to be reckoned with. Although they wear light armor, their agility allows them to dance around slow opponents, while drowning the weaker inhabitants of the Old World with blows. Known to be warriors as well as players, the Amazons that make up these teams unsurprisingly manage to routinely crush their opponents, even at the highest levels of competition.<br/><br/>This plastic kit allows you to assemble the Kara Temple Harpies, a team of Amazons for use in Blood Bowl games. It consists of 6 Eagle Warrior Linewomen, 2 Piranha Warrior Blitzers, 2 Python Warrior Throwers and 2 Jaguar Warrior Blockers. In addition, this box contains 2 double-sided Blood Bowl pieces, 2 turn and raise counters, 4 balloons and a sheet containing 292 decals, all in the style of the Amazon teams.<br/><br/>Rules for using the Amazon teams in your Blood Bowl games are available in the Spike! Journal 15.<br/><br/>This kit includes 102 plastic components and comes with 12x 32mm round Citadel bases and 1x Amazon Team Decal Sheet. These figures are supplied unpainted and require assembly.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Thanks to Clem and Yann who generously gave precious advice and granted access to the rich graphic library of Devil Pig, I have been equiped with both intel and means to embark on this adventure which is in all quite new to me.<br/><br/>But where to begin? Clearly, the problem was not finding an idea but choosing the right one from my vast amount of ideas&hellip; The arrival of the FFI dice and order tokens tilted the balance. Reading up on the subject along with finding several internet images pertaining to the French Resistance provided inspiration. My vision on how this page of our history is intertwined with the secret war in the universe of Achtung Cthulhu prompted me to create a new FFI unit and different options.<br/><br/>For a long time I wanted to expand this faction so as to turn it into a complete and in certain cases independent army. Initially made to represent only the French Resistance, an FFI army can be used to depict any group of civilians that has taken up arms, regardless of their nationality in the scenario or whether they are deployed in the HoN or SoN universe. I spent many hours in front of my screen, with trials and errors, corrections, new attempts&hellip; So finally today, I have the pleasure of presenting to you, my first punchboard. It is approved by Yann and Clem and validated as an official DPG product.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Empires of Arcana is a fantasy empire-building board game, designed over the past 2 years. In it, you will play a warlord trying to dominate Arcana, using a variety of troops to conquer your enemies. As you build up your empire, you will be able to collect more gold and mana, allowing you to build still stronger structures, support larger armies, and cast more powerful magic.<br/><br/>It was designed to be simple to learn and fast-playing, but there are many roads to victory and strategies can be complex. Some players strive for magical supremacy, allowing them to cast enormous amounts of spells per turn, including collapsing enemy structures or destroying entire armies in rains of fire. Some build networks of gates, providing enormous flexibility in maneuvering troops and giving a boost to income. Some try to rapidly build castles up in their territories, giving great bonuses to defense and income, while allowing many dragons to be recruited per turn. Still others simply strive for rapid conquest, using basic infantry and cavalry to their best effect and depending on large land holdings to pay for their armies.<br/><br/>Empires of Arcana was also built for flexibility. Two different ways to play come with the game, including an aggressive goblin scenario that puts player cooperation to the test and is perfectly suited for solitaire play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tTwo Variants of &quot;Stapeldammen&quot;There are at least two different games called &quot;Stapeldammen&quot; (i.e. &quot;stacking checkers&quot;), which are played in the Netherlands. They are both boardgames of abstract strategy.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariant IStapeldammen I has been reported to exist at least since the early 1960s, although it may be much older.<br/><br/>It is played on a 10&times;10 checkers board with 20 pieces each. The goal is to capture or block all pieces of the opponent. The usual rules of International Checkers apply, notably backwards capture and maximum capture.<br/><br/>But there are three exceptions:<br/><br/>     Whenever a checker is captured, it is put under the checker capturing. That way stacks are built. A stack belongs to the player who owns the topmost piece, and it moves accordingly. If a stack is captured, then only the topmost piece is removed and it is put at the bottom of the stack capturing.<br/>     There is no promotion. Pieces reaching the back rank stay there unless they can leave it by means of a backwards capture.<br/>     A stack can be captured several times in one capturing move, provided that the capturing stack has captured other pieces in between.<br/><br/><br/>Draws appear to be impossible in Stapeldammen.<br/><br/>Stapeldammen was an inspiration for Emergo.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.mindsports.nl/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.mindsports.nl/</a> - (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariant IIStapeldammen II was probably created by Tim ter Kuile in the late 1960s.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Stapeldammen II is played on a checkered board of 10x10 squares. The left corner square of White must be dark. Each player (either called &quot;White&quot; or &quot;Black&quot;) owns 20 men of his color, either light or dark ones. Initially these men are stacked in twos on the player's first two rows and thus forming stacks. Gameplay proceeds only on the dark squares.<br/><br/>Black starts. The pieces (single men and stacks alike) may move one square diagonally towards the opponent unto the adjacent square, if it is vacant, until they reach the opponent's back row, where they cannot move any longer (but still capture!). The man on top of a stack determines its ownership. It is not permitted to pass a move.<br/><br/>You can capture opponent's men, which are on diagonally adjacent squares by leaping over them. The piece performing the capture must land immediately beyond (similar to the short checkers leap) on a vacant square. It is allowed to jump forwards or backwards. Opponent's men that were leaped are taken immediately and are placed beneath the leaping piece so that stacks are formed or increased in height. If a stack is leaped only its upmost man is captured. Capturing must continue as long as possible and the sequence must be taken which captures most. A stack may only be leaped more than once in a turn if another man is captured in-between. Captures have priority over non-capturing moves.<br/><br/>The game ends when (at his turn) a player is unable to move. Each player receives as many points as he got men on the opponent's back row including opponent's men which are there under his control. Any men that are not on either player's back row are considered to be neutral and are not counted. The player who got more points wins. It is exceedingly rare that both players achieve the same number of points, which would result in a tie.<br/><br/>",

How about when family movie night is interrupted by an unexpected sex scene?<br/><br/>Try to get your team to guess what random moment you're reacting to by just making a face! No sounds, words, or movement allowed!<br/><br/>To play, one team draws 4 cards from 1 of the decks (happy, sad, scared and mad). Each deck contains cards that describe a specific situation. For example, you will find situations like &quot;A pigeon just flew right up in your face&quot; in the scared deck.<br/><br/>The team picks 1 of the 4 cards to give to the facemaker on the other team. They pass that card to the facemaker who memorizes it and then gives it back. That card is shuffled in with the other 3 cards and passed to the guessers on the facemaker's team. The facemaker takes the mirror that is provided with the game to prepare their expression while their teammates read the 4 cards out loud.<br/><br/>When ready, the facemaker reveals their expression and must hold it while their teammates try to decide which of the 4 situations they are reacting to. If they guess correctly, they keep the card. If they are wrong, the other team gets the card. Once everyone has been the facemaker once, the teams count up their cards to see who won!<br/><br/>",

The chief can go anywhere, except crossing over walls. For each building he lands on that not already has a staff member, the player can take the corresponding staff tile from the display, if he is present in the display, and place it on the building.

A team is declared the winner when all players on opposing teams have been eliminated.<br/><br/>Cards<br/>There are 3 types of cards in the game: Character Cards, Action Cards and Health Trackers.<br/><br/>Character Cards<br/>Each character belongs to one of 3 teams, indicated by the symbol on the upper-right hand corner of the character card:<br/>&bull;  Team Orange<br/>&bull;  Team Purple<br/>&bull;  Team Neutral aka &quot;double agent&quot;<br/><br/>Action Cards<br/>There are 6 categories of action cards:<br/>&bull;  Attack<br/>&bull;  Defense<br/>&bull;  Health<br/>&bull;  Theft<br/>&bull;  Luck<br/>&bull;  Power<br/><br/>Players and Setup<br/>The game can be played with 2 - 9 players. Players choose characters and join their respective teams.<br/><br/>For Odd Number of Players: Choose an equal number of characters from Orange &amp; Purple, plus the Neutral character.<br/><br/>For Even Number of Players: Choose an equal number of characters from Orange &amp; Purple.<br/><br/>Choosing Character Cards: Players should be seated in a circle. Each player chooses a character, keeping in mind that adjacent players cannot be on the same team. Place your character card faceup for everyone to see, overlapping the Health Tracker<br/><br/>Distributing Action Cards: Before the game begins, Action Cards are shuffled and the deck is placed facedown. Each player is dealt 5 cards facedown. Players pick up and view their cards, but may not show them to others.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game begins with the youngest player at the table.<br/><br/>On each turn, in the order stated below, players shall:<br/>&bull;  Draw 2 cards from the deck and add them to their hand. Players may also choose to forego drawing cards on any turn.<br/>&bull;  Play as many cards as they wish (zero or more) from their hand. Only 1 attack turn card can be played per turn. Players may play other types of cards before and/or after an attack. Played cards are placed faceup in a common discard pile.<br/>&bull;  End their turn and discard any unwanted cards (see below)<br/><br/>Ending your turn<br/>Players may end their turn at any time, even without playing a single card. However, at the time they end their turn, they must discard any cards of their choice until they hold at most 5 cards.<br/><br/>Holding More Than 5 Cards<br/>Players may end up holding more than 5 cards outside their turn. This is permitted. Example: A player holding 5 cards draws a 6th card when another player plays brahma [Fortune].<br/><br/>Managing the deck: If the deck runs out, shuffle the discard pile and place the cards facedown. Continue playing.<br/><br/>Attacking<br/>Every attack card has an associated attack damage and attack weapon. Players play attack cards to deal damage to their opponents. On each turn, a player may play a maximum of 1 attack card.<br/><br/>Defending<br/>When attacked, a player can defend themselves by playing a defense card in real-time, out-of-turn. Each defense card includes the attack weapon, that it can defend against. Some power cards or Superpowers can also assist in defending.<br/><br/>Losing and Restoring Health<br/>If players are unable to defend an attack, they lose health equal to the damage, included on the attack card. Players can restore health by playing a health card during their turn to heal themselves or other players. (Illustration to the right shows how to track health)<br/><br/>Player Revival: At the time that a player&rsquo;s health goes to zero, any player may play sanjeevani [Herbs] in real-time, out-of-turn, to revive this player back to 1 health.<br/><br/>Player Elimination: If a player reaches zero health and isn&rsquo;t revived in real-time, they are eliminated from the game and must flip over their character card. The attacking player receives all in-hand cards from the defeated player.<br/><br/>Stealing<br/>Players use theft cards to strategically weaken their opponents. Note: When stealing from another player&rsquo;s in-hand cards, you must choose that card facedown.<br/><br/>Superpowers<br/>Each character has a unique skill, or Superpower, listed on their character card. Superpowers supersede Action Cards. Example: The Superpower of rama [Protector] allows players to enhance jatayu [Shield] as a defense against either attack weapon.<br/><br/>Power Cards<br/>Players play power cards during their turn by placing them in front of their own or another player&rsquo;s character card. Power cards supersede Superpowers and Action Cards. Example: If a player has lakshman rekha [Palisade] placed next to them, any attack on the player must first be evaluated against this power.<br/><br/>Chaos Mode<br/>Once you&rsquo;re familiar with the regular gameplay, try out Chaos Mode for a faster-paced experience. It&rsquo;s most fun with 5+ players. The group must decide on this mode before the game begins.<br/>&bull;  Attacks: every player may play up to 2 attack cards in a turn<br/>&bull;  Defense: any player may play a defense card in real-time, outside their turn, to protect the player being attacked. Note: If someone else defends a player, Superpowers of neither the player being attacked, nor the one defending the attack apply.<br/>&bull;  Revivals: Each player is entitled to 1 revival per game. That is, when players reach zero health, they revive back to full health in real-time.<br/><br/>",

Star Players like Jordell Freshbreeze and Gloriel Summerbloom have become household names for Blood Bowl fans everywhere. Wood Elf teams are incredibly popular, as they're known to put on an impressive show &ndash; they're just as likely to (literally) dance circles around their rivals as they are to get smashed in (literally) spectacular fashion. They play the game better than just about anyone else, and they look stunning while they're at it.<br/><br/>Wood Elves hit hard and fast, but they're not known for their endurance and resilience, alas. They&rsquo;re the proverbial glass dagger, but in the hands of a skilled coach they can produce impressive results. If you're content to scrape by with minimal effort, this isn't the team for you &ndash; it takes finesse and skill to win games, but when you succeed, you know you've earned it. For their part, Wardancers are amongst the most impressive starting players in the game, all your Wood Elf players start with at least 7 Movement, and they have access to one of the wildest collections of Star Players to be found anywhere.<br/><br/>This multipart plastic kit contains all the components you need to assemble the Athelorn Avengers, a Wood Elf team for use in games of Blood Bowl, containing 2 Catchers, 2 Throwers, 2 Wardancers and 6 Line Elves, plus a roster sheet. Also included are a transfer sheet, 2 turn markers featuring a Wood Elf motif, 3 thematic balls, and 14 Citadel 32mm Round bases featuring holes in which to place the ball.<br/><br/>The rules to use Wood Elf teams in your games of Blood Bowl can be found in Spike!

        "description": "Blackbeard's Lost Fleet combines deck-building, worker placement and subtle area control mechanics. Players expand their card decks with more Loyal Pirates, and then send them on missions using pirate fast ships. And all this with the aim of inciting rebellion and taking over the ships of Blackbeard's lost fleet, or finding the location where his legendary treasure is hidden. Not to forget that what counts among pirates is the fame and support of the Flying Gang, which chooses who will rule Nassau.<br/><br/>Decks of pirate companions allow players to send their men to specific places. Some cards give you the ability to get something immediately, while others give you the ability to perform an action specific to a particular pirate. Cards can be acquired for their decks, as well as discarding those that the Player deems unnecessary. In addition, most cards can be used in several ways.<br/><br/>Taking over specific ships of Blackbeard's fleet not only gives the Player more support from his pirate brethren, but also provides constant bonuses during the game.<br/><br/>Who wins? The one with the largest fleet, the one supported by the majority of pirates, or the one who finds Blackbeard's legendary treasure first?<br/><br/>The game is language independent. There is only iconography on the cards and boards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Bummer.. though a few techno-radical groups had foreseen this, for they developed GridL, a super-computer program which tried to preserve as much life as possible by storing them as advanced code on an infinite grid. It's goal was to mimic natural selection and restart life, once conditions were favorable in the outside world.<br/><br/>Luckily, you are one of the few humans who were saved by GridL. Now locked permanently inside the program since ages, you must try to get out by passing the GridL Test - a bizarre game that will decide if you are worthy enough to survive outside! GridL will assay your decoding and communication strengths - are you smart enough to work as a team, and qualify for the same?<br/><br/>In the game of GridL, two teams must successfully transmit finite solutions coded on a 5x5 Grid, to their teammates. The catch - each axis of the grid gets a random generated word, and communication limiters force players to use restricted word clues connecting these two words! Teams hope to cross the barrier of 12 points before the opponent team to pass the GridL test and win the game!<br/><br/>In a 2-3 player variant, all players work together as a team and try to gather enough points before specific number of turns! In an advanced variant, teams can choose some mini programs (12 in number) - powers designed to help teams optimize their scores if timed and played strategically!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

In these source materials we explore the exciting world of naval combat at the height of the Age of Sail. It is a time when England&rsquo;s &ldquo;Wooden Walls&rdquo; kept her commerce alive and the armies of Napoleon at bay. A time when tall, proud warships prowled the vast waterways of the world, and such ships as the U.S.S. Constitution were to earn their place as legend.<br/><br/>For those of you who are new to either Victory by Any Means or Starboard Tack Press products, welcome! This game is modeled after the popular Victory by Any Means: Campaign Guide, and has been carefully developed and tested to fit the unique feel of the Age of Sail. By using the Origins Award (2005 Vanguard) winning Fire As She Bears! game as our tactical system, we can finally give gamers a fluid product that lets you worry about important decisions and planning of the Admiralty. For this latest source, the VBAM team has worked with Phil C. Fry, the author of the popular Napoleonic tactical naval game Fire As She Bears! to bring you a supplement which enables you to fight the war at sea as the Admiralty of a nation, subject to the whims of the crown and to generate gritty battles where sailing skills and cunning decide the fate of the battle.<br/><br/>This is a stand alone book that requires no other VBAM Games products to play, although Starboard Tack Press&rsquo; Fire As She Bears! Second Edition is highly recommended for a complete Age of Sail experience.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "T&uuml;rkenkrieg: The Russo-Austro Turkish War, Balkan Theatre 1737-39<br/>Volume V in the Lace Wars series<br/><br/>TK is a two-player game: Imperial Austria against the Ottoman Empire. The Turks have three provincial armies, composed of a mix of infantry and cavalry, and the Sultan's own army of heavy cavalry, janissaries, and artillery. They can also call upon Wallachian and Tatar allies. The Imperials have their core Habsburg-Austrian army, plus contingents from the Holy Roman Empire, and elements from the personal armies of Saxony, Bavaria, and even Modena. They also have the irregular forces of the Military Border.<br/><br/>Both sides are evenly matched - weakened by war but still dwarfing the forces of their neighbors. The Imperials begin as the aggressors, but will have to play cannily to avoid surrendering the initiative to the Ottomans. Playing for Prestige (like the other games in the series), your goals are modest, but can add up to significant gains that may influence the outcome of the peace talks. The peace process, more or less out of your hands, is the mechanism by which the game ends.<br/><br/>Map scale is 8.5 miles per hex. Unit scale is battalion/regimental. Units are rated for Effectiveness and Movement; raw strength is factored into Effectiveness.<br/><br/>Turns are equivalent to three weeks - 16 turns per year. Each turn is broken down into several phases - supply, operations, admin, etc. There are scenarios for each year of active operations - three in all - and a Campaign Game.<br/><br/>A few key concepts include Initiative and Operational Preparedness, Campaign Plans, Prestige, and Auxiliaries. This game uses the 3rd edition of the Lace Wars rules, amended to 3.1.<br/><br/>The heart of the game is the Operations Phase, where the players move their formations, lay siege to fortresses and engage in battle. The player with the initiative can dictate the pace of the game, but since initiative is based on operational preparedness, it can pass to another side, perhaps at an inconvenient time.<br/><br/>Auxiliary counters represent support troops and irregulars who had a major impact on operations, but cannot be adequately represented as traditional game units. Instead, a player might have a pontooneer auxiliary that he can play onto a stack to help it cross a major river, or a converged grenadier auxiliary that provides a morale bonus in combat. Because of the scale, many combat elements can be used either as units or as Auxiliaries.<br/>[Playing cards could have been used instead of counters, but there are production issues involved, and besides, some of the auxiliaries' functions are hard to indicate with cards. In essence, however, auxiliaries are that kind of game asset, not &quot;pawns&quot; like the combat units.]<br/><br/>Leaders have an important role to play, as befitting an era where personal command was critical. They are rated for skill or effectiveness, personality, and influence (i.e. the chance they have of retaining command despite their incompetence).<br/><br/>The supply system incorporates lines of communication, the strategic placement of depots, foraging, and attrition. River and canal movement has been taken into account and will prove as critical to success as the use of rail lines in games that cover more modern periods.<br/><br/>The combat system has a tactical feel - while not a full sub-system with battlefield maps, it addresses the key issues of frontage, reserves, and supports, as well as firepower and morale. Winning a battle will bring you the acclaim of your noble peers, but may not gain you any strategic advantage; losing a battle can be catastrophic.<br/><br/>Components<br/><br/>1) Eight 12x18 inch full colour maps representing the Danube Basin and the surrounding lands, from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, and from central Hungary to Bulgaria.<br/><br/>2) 1080 counters representing the forces of Austria, Saxony, Bavaria, Hesse, Cologne and other Holy Roman Empire states, Modena, the Sultan's Army, the Ottoman provincial commands of Bosnia, Rumelia, and Silistria, the Wallachians, and the Crimean Tatars.<br/><br/>3) A set of charts and tables, plus several 11x17 inch display cards.<br/><br/>4) A series rulebook - 3rd Edition (3.1) - called the King's Regulations and Orders (KR&amp;Os), a game-exclusive rulebook, scenario &amp; OOB information, and an historical commentary.<br/><br/>",

The advanced designs and ideas have made a huge leap forward with the introduction of VK engines. With these, the new planes can achieve incredible feats, thought impossible just a few years ago: they can fly faster and climb higher than anyone could dream of. The latest generation engines even allow for almost stationary flight and vertical take-off and landing. The Horten brothers, the two Axis top engineers in the field have access to endless resources to make new planes: with these, the Axis shall rule the skies once more.<br/><br/>The HO-357.V mounts a weapon that has been in use in the Luftwaffe since 1945: the X-4 Missile. Designed to stop Allied bombers from delivering their deadly payload on the Reich, this missile is the first air to air wire-guided weapon ever produced in the world. It's extremely effective but very difficult to use as the pilot must fly its plane while controlling the missile at the same time. Designed to tear apart big plane, this weapon system is only used upon ground targets as a last resort.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Laser Lightning&rdquo; (Laser Blitz) is the first aircraft in the world to mount laser weapons. This version of the dreaded weapon is capable of firing much more focused beams on armor while firing short burst on infantry. It was created for one of the greatest ace on the planet: Klaus von Richthofen.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Lightning&rdquo; (Der Blitz) is the first aircraft in the world to mount laser weapons.

The placement of escorts to offer front, rear, and flank protection to the convoy is complicated by the size of the convoy and available assets. Additional decisions must be made on where to place the escorts, which are equipped with Type 271 radars, the key to your defense.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, a player&rsquo;s Escort Group may receive upgrades in the form of additional radars, HF/DF (High-Frequency Direction Finding) equipment, and possibly additional ships. Air support can be key, but until the CVE &ldquo;jeep carriers&rdquo; arrive, the &ldquo;Black Pit&rdquo; in the center of the Atlantic remains a high threat area.<br/><br/>Players will find it highly challenging to minimize convoy losses and keep them to an acceptable level.<br/><br/>Players may choose any of 9 historical Escort Groups (five British, four Canadian) armed with historical destroyers and corvettes.<br/><br/>These ships include:<br/><br/>     B/C/D/E Classes DE<br/>     F Class DE<br/>     H Class DE<br/>     V&amp;W Class DE<br/>     Town Class DE (American Lend Lease)<br/>     River Class FF<br/>     Flower Class Corvettes<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay moves quickly, following a set sequence of events that are repeated until the end of the game. Once your initial Escort Group is set up, play proceeds by rolling for a convoy and escorting it across the Atlantic. Enemy forces range from single U-boats (typically a type VII, but possibly a Type IX) to entire wolfpacks. Wolfpacks increase in size (as they did historically) and will be your primary challenge. Encounters are randomly generated, ensuring no two careers will ever be the same. Weather can impact operations, as well as air support and crew upgrades due to experience. A logical but reasonably simple set of instructions bring the U-boats in to attack you from random directions, making your initial defensive array very important.<br/><br/>Of particular note is the game is designed to integrate with The Hunters if players wish to combine the games.<br/><br/>Atlantic Sentinels: North Atlantic Convoy Escorts, 1942-43 is meant to be a highly playable and interesting solitaire game covering the actions an Escort Group would have to deal with in fighting the U-boat peril during convoy escort.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>Complexity: 4 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 10 out of 10 (solitaire game design)<br/>Time Scale: Semi-abstract (Convoy escort missions, 2 per month)<br/>Map Scale: Abstract<br/>Unit Scale: Individual escorts, U-boats, merchant ships (when targeted)<br/>Players: One (with option for two)<br/>Playing Time: 15 to 20 minutes (single mission), 6-8 hours (full career)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Offers two games.  A three dimensional four-in-a-row game that you can play against a human opponent or against 3 levels of AI or Lights Out, a game played solely against one of 3 levels of AI in which your goal is to turn off all the lit up spaces.<br/><br/>The four-in-a-row game, known as Smart Four, is similar to other four-in-a-row games, with a couple of differences.  First, the four in a row can happen in any dimensions, so four blocks stacked atop of each other would be a win.  The other is that the electronic board will confirm when a winning move has been played by flashing when a victory has been achieved.  This can be played versus a human player or against 3 levels of AI.<br/><br/>In the other game, Lights Out, played solely against one of three levels of AI, is one in which the goal is to shut all the lit up spots on the board off.  Depending on the difficulty level, some number of spots will be lit up.  When a player presses a spot on the board, all orthogonally adjacent spots will switch from off to on or on to off depending on their original state.  A player wins when all lights are out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Clobber your enemies, knock down buildings, and unleash your fearsome breath weapons in this personal love letter to Showa-era monster fights. At its core, Amabel Holland's Kaiju Table Battles is about teams of giant monsters beating the snot out of each other on a tense 5 x 4 battle grid. Dice you roll and place this turn can be spent on a later turn to unleash attacks, or to use reactions to cancel or mitigate the attacks coming in your direction. Each of your fifty-foot fighters has their own combination of attacks, reactions, movement effects, and special powers, giving them a unique role on the battlefield and in your team.<br/><br/>While you're trying to win a match against your opponent, you're also working with them to achieve a cooperative goal that emphasizes some aspect of the game. For example, you might be trying to knock down three buildings, and the most efficient way to do that of course is to slam an enemy monster into them! Achieve the goal, and you'll get to open an envelope containing a brand new monster and a new rule that applies to all future matches. These envelopes also contain &quot;swaps&quot; &ndash; alternate attacks and powers for existing monsters, allowing you to customize your team and try out new strategies. (Each of the nine envelopes is hand-packed by the game's designer or someone important to her.)<br/><br/>Over the course of several matches, the game itself becomes more complex, challenging, and nuanced. It's not quite a legacy game &ndash; no components are destroyed or altered, and there isn't an overarching start-to-finish narrative with plot twists. But as the game's colorful cast of characters grows, what emerges is a kind of story told along the edges &ndash; a series of meditations on monsters, identity, community, and queerness.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fields of Fortune is a press-your-luck card game of medieval city-building.<br/><br/>In the game, players attempt to build the most prosperous city while avoiding barbarian raids. The game consists of a 102-card fortune deck, with most cards being beneficial to a player's city, such as castles, city squares, military structures, religious structures, and treasuries. However, the deck also contains barbarian horde cards of varying strength that may result in a raid.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they may choose to either hire mercenaries (if available) or add cards to the field. A player adds cards to the field by turning over cards from the fortune deck, one at a time and laying them out in the play area between all players (the field). The player may continue to add cards to the field until they choose to stop, barbarians raid the field, or eight cards are in the field. When a player chooses to stop, they then choose up to three cards from the field to add to their city. The cards are sorted in the player's city by type as the player is trying to maximize points by completing sets of the different types.<br/><br/>Each barbarian horde card has a strength value of 1-3. A barbarian raid occurs when a player is adding cards to the field and a total of 5 or more strength points worth of barbarian horde cards is revealed. When this happens, the field is swept (all cards are removed to the discard pile) and the player's turn immediately ends.<br/><br/>Alternately, instead of adding cards to the field, a player may choose to hire mercenaries if there are any available in the general supply. Mercenaries will help the player defend against barbarian raids by destroying barbarian horde cards in the field of equal or lesser value, just as a player's regular army cards do. A player who chooses to hire mercenaries may still collect cards from the field, if any, that were previously placed there by another player.<br/><br/>When the fortune deck runs out and no mercenaries cards are left in the supply, the player with the most points based on all cards in their city wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The king is initially placed in each player's &quot;base&quot; in the corner of his territory and the knights are held in hand.<br/><br/>Players take turns placing pawns in their own territories (the spaces closest to them). The arrows on the pawns indicate the directions in which they can move. The direction of the arrows can be freely chosen when the pawns are placed. Also, the direction of the arrows can be changed when a pawn is moved.<br/><br/>When the king reaches the central neutral zone, he is flipped to his reverse side to become a knight. If a player's king reaches the enemy's corner base, that player wins, so a good strategy will include attacks and retreats.<br/><br/>(When the game was in development, it was named 'Shooter'.)<br/><br/>Publisher's summary:<br/>3個のナイト駒を使って王様駒を取るゲームです。王様駒は自陣コーナーに<br/>初期配置してナイト駒は持ち駒です。<br/>手番で駒を自陣内（手前スペース）に配置できます。駒の矢印が動ける方向<br/>です。配置時に任意に決められます。また駒が動いた時に矢印の方向を変えられます。<br/>王様駒は中央の中立地帯まで到達すると裏返してナイトの動きも加わります。王様駒が敵陣コーナーに到達しても勝ちなので、攻撃とトライの両方で戦略を組み立てます。<br/><br/>",

Before playing the first card, the starting player can peek at two of the scoring tokens in play and return them face down in the center of the table. The starting player plays the card they want from their hand, face up, on the table. The other players, clockwise, play one card each. Players are required to play cards of the suit played by the starting player. If you do not have cards from the suit played by the starting player, can play any card. When all players have played a card, the player who played the lowest card of the same suit played by the starting player reveals the chips of score and takes one of them. Then the player who played the highest card of the suit played by the leading player wins the trick and takes a second chip.<br/><br/>In games for 5 or 6 players, the third chip is donated by the winner of the trick to any player except himself and the player who took the first token of the turn. When players have no more cards in their hands, the game ends. Players tally their scoring tokens. Whoever has the highest score wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>In the 17th century, the Dutch built powerful fleets to protect their overseas trade, particularly the riches flowing from the Spice Islands &mdash; the region that would become known as the Dutch East Indies and eventually Indonesia. In 1880, the discovery of oil in the archipelago made them once again a potential source of enormous wealth.<br/><br/>But as oil became the underpinning of 20th century economies, the Netherlands this time failed to build the naval strength necessary to guard the islands from predatory enemies. Conservative economists clung to the gold standard in the 1930s, dooming the Dutch economy to a prolonged Depression. By the time the Navy began to see increased funding, it was much too late to change the outcome of the Japanese invasion of the Dutch East Indies.<br/><br/>In the 1930s, Dutch shipyards stood at the leading edge of naval technology: Dutch submarines first deployed the schnorkel breathing device, for example, and Dutch warships boasted the sophisticated Hazemeyer fire control system that would be enthusiastically copied by the Royal Navy and others. The Netherlands had the means to create a large and modern fleet, and the oil wealth of Borneo and Sumatra provided the motive. But by seeing deficits as a more lethal enemy than the Axis, the government doomed both the home country and the colonies to defeat and occupation.<br/><br/>Spice Islands is a Second World War at Sea supplement exploring the alternate history possibilities had the Netherlands built the necessary naval and air forces to defend the East Indies and its oil: ships and planes within its financial and industrial capability.  The supplement includes ten scenarios, or separate game situations, based on battles that might have been waged by the Royal Netherlands Navy against the Japanese. The pieces represent modernized versions of the dreadnought battleships planned but not completed, and some of those planned or discussed but never built. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Strike South to play most of the scenarios and Midway to enjoy all of them.&quot;<br/><br/>Spice Islands was originally sold exclusively via pdf download.  Starting in 2011, it was made available as a printed and spiral-bound booklet with die-cut counters.<br/><br/>There are 210 counters, 70 long &quot;ship&quot; units, and 140 smaller ship, aircraft and fleet / base units.<br/><br/>",

Cut off from their bases in Europe, the Italian Red Sea Flotilla did its best to close off this vital route leading from India and Australia to the Suez Canal.<br/><br/>Horn of Africa takes players to this little-known theatre of the Second World War, the battles between the Royal Navy&rsquo;s Red Sea Force and the Regia Marina&rsquo;s Red Sea Flotilla during the East African Campaign of 1940-1941. Ten battle and 15 operational scenarios depict the major actions of the campaign, along with a number of hypothetical situations that examine possible British intervention in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War of 1935-1936, as well as the use of ships on both sides not historically available but which with better preparation in the 1930&rsquo;s or even on the eve of war could have been present.<br/><br/>Horn of Africa is a complete boxed game in the Second World War at Sea series. There are 40 &ldquo;long&rdquo; ship pieces and 60 square pieces representing small warships, transports, aircraft and markers needed for play. These include the complete Red Sea Flotilla and Red Sea Force, plus some unusual ships planned but never built (or never re-built) by both the Royal Navy and the Regia Marina.<br/><br/>The operational map depicts the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, including all the major ports and airbases (such as they were) of 1940-42. The tactical map is a generic blue field of hexagons, used to resolve surface combat. There, ships maneuver and fight using their gunnery and torpedo factors. Each player rolls a number of dice according to the ship&rsquo;s capabilities, hitting on a result of 6. Gunnery and torpedo damage tables give the results: Ships can suffer damage to engines, hull or armament. Air attacks are resolved in similar fashion. The combat systems yield results rapidly but in a historically accurate fashion, giving a good balance of fun and insight.<br/><br/>",

Along the way, you and your opponents will help industrialize Japan's largest island, upgrading low-paying dits into profitable cities. (In fact, failing to do so will result in end-game penalties!) Of course, cities can be tokened, allowing you to create chokepoints on the fly. A nasty, nasty map.<br/><br/>The second map shifts the scene to exotic and fantastical Wisconsin. This is a sprawling &quot;big money&quot; map for three to five players. The major gimmick here is that there are nine 5Ts, and these trains are &quot;diesels&quot; &ndash; running as far as you like along a stretch of compatible track. Plan carefully in the early game, and you can end up with a triple-digit run in the last couple Operating Rounds. But an inconvenient change in gauge or station can stop your diesel before it leaves the station.<br/><br/>When the base game came &quot;back in print&quot; in 2021, we added Company Charter cards. Those cards are also included in this expansion for our early adopters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "ROBOTS! is a casual strategy card game where players try to collect robots&mdash;consisting of runs like 2,3,4 or sets like &quot;three of a kind&quot; in poker&mdash;while defending collections from the onslaught of robot violence. It's a race to collect as many points as possible while dodging freakin' laser beams and avoiding short circuits. It can be played with 2-5 players ages 12+ with a single game consisting of multiple hands, lasting about 60-120 minutes total.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>ROBOTS! is a take on Rummy meaning it's a &quot;draw and discard&quot; card game, but with a Take That mechanic.<br/><br/>The &quot;Constructed Robot&quot; cards are removed from the deck and each player is given an &quot;Attack Card&quot; to help remember the rules. The most technically inclined player is selected to deal first (this is ROBOTS! after all). The dealer shuffles the deck and deals each player seven cards, clockwise starting to the dealer's left. The remaining cards are placed face-down in the center of play and the top card is turned face-up. The face-down cards become the &quot;Robot Factory&quot; and the face-up cards form the &quot;Scrap Heap&quot; (also known as the discard pile). The first player is the person to the dealer's left.<br/><br/>The Player's Turn<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they will first draw from either the &quot;Robot Factory&quot; (stack of face-down cards) or pick up one or more cards from the &quot;Scrap Heap&quot; (the face-up/discarded cards). If the player picks up more than one card from the Scrap Heap, the bottom-most picked up card must be played that hand in a spread (we'll get to that in a minute). Otherwise, picking the top card from the Factory or Scrap Heap does not require the player to lay down any cards at all; the player may save the card for later play.<br/><br/>The player now makes a spread if they have the ability, although sometimes waiting can be a useful strategy. A spread must consist of at least three cards and can be:<br/><br/>A sequence of numbered cards (run) of the same suit (color) such as all gray 2,3,4 or all purple 11,12,13.<br/><br/>A set of the same numbered cards such as red 9, green 9 and blue 9.<br/><br/>A star card can be used as either a 1 or a 15, but runs cannot wrap around. Red star, 2, 3 is allowed, but 14, star, 2 is not.<br/><br/>The wild robot can be used in place of any number, but it will prevent the player from constructing a robot (stay tuned).<br/><br/>These spreads will go in front of the player face-up for all to see. They will remain there until the end of the hand (or until an opponent blows them to bits with an attack card). The player can lay down as many spreads as desired on their turn, but they may never pick a card back up from a laid down spread. Once the player has completed their laying down of spreads (or of course done nothing), the player must discard a card from their hand to the top of the Scrap Heap. Be sure that all of the card numbers are visible since players may elect to pick these cards up on their turn.<br/><br/>Ending the Hand and Scoring<br/><br/>Play will continue clockwise until one person plays all of their cards leaving one final card to discard, thus ending the hand. Points are tallied and the dealer duties rotate to the left. Points are awarded for cards played in a spread such that:<br/><br/>Cards numbered 2-9 are worth five points <br/>Cards numbered 10-14 are worth ten points <br/>The star cards are worth fifteen points <br/>Wild cards are worth zero<br/><br/>The spread points are positive, but any cards still in a player's hand when another player discards their last card become negative. Yup, it's entirely possible to end the hand with less than zero points. Write the scores down and the dealer passes to the left.<br/><br/>At this point, you might say, hey, this is EXACTLY Rummy. But no! We have robots, and these robots have special powers.<br/><br/>Building a Robot<br/><br/>If a player makes a spread of all five of the same robot, the player has &quot;constructed the robot&quot; and gets 50 bonus points in addition to the normal point values of the cards. However, if a player uses a wild card in the set, the player does not build a robot and thus earns zero bonus points.<br/><br/>Remember those &quot;Constructed Robot&quot; cards we removed at the beginning? When a player builds a robot, remove those five cards from the hand and replace them with the corresponding &quot;Constructed Robot&quot; card. These robots are impervious to attacks. At the end of the hand, the robot is disassembled and the original five cards are shuffled back into the deck.<br/><br/>Robot Powers<br/><br/>There are also six attacks that take effect when the corresponding card is discarded to the Scrap Heap. These are powerful moves that can shift the game dynamic, but the actions are only playable on the high-point cards. Choosing to discard and play a powerful card means an opponent may either score them or use the power against you.<br/><br/>The six powers are:<br/><br/>Short Circuit: When discarded, choose a player. That player must place two cards from their hand on the bottom of the scrap heap. That player draws two cards from the robot factory.<br/><br/>Tractor Beam: When discarded, place the bottom half of the scrap heap under the robot factory. Don&rsquo;t count this card and round up if the heap has an odd number of cards.<br/><br/>Recycle: When discarded, take any single card from the scrap heap into your hand.<br/><br/>Force Field: When discarded, the next player cannot pick up any cards from the scrap heap.<br/><br/>Freakin' Laser Beam: When discarded, place both this card and a card from an opponent&rsquo;s sets under the scrap heap, this card lowest. If a set is broken, the remaining cards return to the owner&rsquo;s hand.<br/><br/>Alpha + Omega: When discarded, place both this card and a card from an opponent&rsquo;s sets under the robot factory. If a set is broken, the remaining cards go onto the bottom of the scrap heap.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>The first player to score 300 points at the end of a hand wins the game. Feel free to change the victory points required to win to a lower or higher number to shorten or lengthen the game, respectively.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Company of Iron is a squad-based skirmish game that reinvents WARMACHINE and HORDES battles as smaller confrontations between fewer warriors and their character leaders. Average games are played with 10&ndash;15 miniatures, and Company of Iron is compatible with the majority of the existing miniatures in the WARMACHINE and HORDES product lines. The rules for Company of Iron have been streamlined and do not include warcasters or warlocks but can include light warjacks and light warbeasts.<br/><br/>The Company of Iron box set is designed for two players and will contain two 20-point armies, including a unit of Cygnar Stormblades and a unit of Minion Farrow Brigands. Additionally, two all-new character solos will be included to lead their respective units: Lieutenant Gwen Keller and Agata, Queen of Carnage. These new models can be used in both Company of Iron and in WARMACHINE and HORDES. All components needed to play the game are in the box set, including rules, tokens, and two types of cards that allow players to choose specialties for their squad leaders as well as battle plans that can provide powerful effects and advantages in combat.<br/><br/>Company of Iron uses the core rules of WARMACHINE and HORDES but has been tailored for the scale of the game and the absence of warcasters and warlocks. Emphasizing its fast-paced skirmish scale and the focus on small squads and solos, gameplay revolves around players taking turns activating one model at a time as opposed to the alternating activation in WARMACHINE and HORDES, in which players activate their entire army during a single turn.<br/><br/>&ldquo;We have designed Company of Iron as an ideal entry point for new players who want to play in the world of WARMACHINE and HORDES,&rdquo; said Chief Creative Officer Matt Wilson. &ldquo;But it&rsquo;s also a product the existing WARMACHINE and HORDES community has been requesting for years, and it scratches that itch for players craving a fast-paced tactical experience that can be played with a shorter time commitment.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Greenberg (co-creator of Wizardry), Rick Dutton, Walter Freitag, and Michael Massimilla.[2] In this first title, players leave their homeworlds setting out to explore the vast unknowns of space. Per the official game text:<br/><br/>In 2815 A.D., the majority of the human race is afraid of space. They are cloistered in the Nine Worlds (Earth and eight colonized planets) in a region called the Galactic Fringe. Even though space travel has been practical since the invention of the dual-axis hyperdrive in 2257, humankind's attempt to colonize &quot;Beyond the Boundary&quot; came to an abrupt halt in 2490. The &quot;Space Plague,&quot; a gargantuan epidemic caused by an organism of alien origin, killed more than half the humanoid population of the galaxy, threatened the extinction of civilization, and forever changed mankind's attitude towards space.<br/><br/>Now, a Space Patrol enforces the &quot;Boundary,&quot; that one-way border around the Nine Worlds in order to prevent anything like the &quot;Space Plague&quot; from ever happening again. Now, anyone may leave the area enclosed by the Boundary, but they may not return.<br/><br/>Thus far, the Boundary has proven effective in keeping ships from entering the Nine Worlds for three centuries, keeping humanity safe from the unknown. Of course, this does provide for a bit of stagnation, as well. After all, no new discoveries, no new challenges, and countless lost opportunities hardly seem compatible with a growing standard of living. Finally, there are those who sense that something is amiss... &quot;<br/><br/>The game is unique in the fact that it is a boardgame in which the computer acts as a moderator and tracks resources.<br/><br/> Reimplemented by: <br/><br/><br/>     Star Saga: Two – The Clathran Menace<br/><br/><br/>",

In the skies, their power is currently unmatched, and they know they have to maintain this supremacy in order to achieve global victory. However, in Zverograd, SSU attack helicopters harass ground troops, and new Axis jets cruise the skies. Each bloc realizes the importance of seizing the skies, so as the Allies prepare to launch a vital series of raids against Zverograd&rsquo;s airfield, they&rsquo;re bringing their best soldiers, toughest walkers, and deadliest new aircraft.<br/><br/>As it follows the Allies' efforts to gain a firmer foothold in the battle for Zverograd, Dust Tactics: Operation &quot;Icarus&quot; introduces new rules for minefields, the limited cover provided by the trees that line the airfield's landing strips, and the quonset huts in which the Axis forces await the Allied assault. Both sides benefit from the leadership of new heroes. Panzerprinz is an ace Axis pilot, and Sgt. Victory stands alone among the Allied troops, accomplishing amazing feats with his superhuman speed, strength, and resilience. All these elements come together to create the dangerous new battleground that comes sharply into focus with the seven tense and ferocious scenarios of the Operation &quot;Icarus&quot; campaign.<br/><br/>",

These people now come together for a same purpose: taking over the whole world and dominating all the factions.<br/><br/>UnderWorld is a card game that designed for two players. With the expansion packs, it will support up to 4 players and unlock 2V2 gaming mode. To begin the battle, each player needs to draw 5 cards from two of the factions first and utilize these cards to fulfill the winning conditions.<br/><br/>Both side of the players need to fight for several objectives such as obtaining highest points and holding the most district cards through sending out character cards with strategies to beat the opponents. Through expanding influences on those districts or beating opponents&rsquo; characters, the corresponding points will be gained. The first player who receives 8 points will win the game.<br/><br/>",

This war became one part of a greater conflict involving the kingdoms of England and France, better known as the Hundred Years` War.<br/><br/>A Just and Cruel War shows how this bloody war was unleashed in the Iberian peninsula. The players will command the destinies of the royal side (&quot;Petristas&quot;), the usurper (&quot;Trastamaras&quot;) and the crown of Aragon.<br/><br/>Game system<br/>The game system (direct heir of the Fall of Hispania) is composed by a common deck of cards (where the historical events of the period are included), and another one specific for each player.<br/><br/>The players direct their armies over the mapboard, and they develop  intricated policies from this historical period, wich can favorise some of the factions that cohabited in the Castilian Kingdom (nobles, Jews, Military Orders...).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Gold is the lifeblood of the war!&quot;<br/><br/>As the Hun horde swept across Europe, they forced the Germanic tribes into exodus. These warlike peoples spread within the borders of the Western Empire and, by dint of looting and war, will eventually cause the collapse of the Empire. In the twilight of antiquity and at the dawn of the Middle Ages, the so-called &quot;barbarian nations&quot; founded kingdoms on the former imperial territory.<br/><br/>In Barbarian Kingdoms, an asymmetrical and competitive strategy game, each player controls their own nascent kingdom and competes for supremacy over Western Europe. The first player to control seven territories or to eliminate two opposing kings wins. On a turn, each player chooses and resolves a single action of their choice:<br/><br/><br/>     Recruitment: deploy a warrior from the reserve by paying a cost<br/>     Taxation: collect money from the provinces in their kingdom<br/>     Assault: invade a province or attack an enemy unit<br/>     Maneuvers: reposition their units in their provinces or towards the sea<br/>     Claim: try to take control of a province by paying a cost<br/><br/><br/>Assault and claim actions can be immediately challenged by an opponent and resolved by a battle. During the battle, a bribe may be paid to the opponent to try to reverse the outcome.<br/><br/>Players must be vigilant in positioning their forces (with the constraint of a maximum of one unit per province), keep an eye on their opponents, and take advantage of their two asymmetrical powers: that of their kingdom and that of their king.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Three human Factions: The Confederation of Sol, the Outer-Worlds Alliance and the Praetorans of Mars have been fighting for domination of the solar system with space fleets from their bases orbiting Earth, Mars and Titan.<br/><br/>Now with the perfection of the FTL hyper drive, Scout-ships are finally able to explore distant stars. Earth, Mars and Titan have agreed a truce in order to settle colonists in new star systems far from our star.<br/><br/>With a small fleet of ships, you must seek out and settling habitable worlds, but you would be wise to hire warships from these factions to protect your Outposts, for the future of these colonies will be beyond the control of Earth.<br/><br/>Send out your Scouts to explore new systems, send out your Transports to bring back rare minerals and gasses to finance your fleet. Hire warships from the Confederation, Alliance and Praetoran navies for your private fleet.<br/><br/>Build Outpost ships and finally Colony ships to settle worlds and claim the title of Star Lord!<br/><br/>In the game you will upgrade your starting deck of Scout ships and Basic Transports with a fleet of warship cards from the three space faring factions. You can buy Outpost ships to build Outposts and later upgrade these to Colonies on suitable worlds you have explored or else capture them from other players. You may control 4 systems at any time by deploying your ships there.<br/><br/>Objective: Control 4 Victory stars. Each Outpost is 1 star, Each Colony (upgrading Outpost) worth 2 stars. This means you win immediately when you control a Colony on 2 worlds, or an Outpost on 4 worlds.<br/><br/>The main USPs for Star Colonies are:  <br/><br/>     Area control (of star systems). Deploying ships to defend or to trade: carrying over unused credits, but you take a risk: extra Credits or nothing if system is seized.  <br/>     Flip discard to draw deck (not shuffle!) so build order stays intact. In the advanced game we add Infiltrators as deck manipulators.  <br/>     Interaction: ability to intercept an attack (with cards from hand) or to target specific star systems and deployed enemy ships.  <br/><br/><br/>The full game works just as well with 2, 3 or 4 players. Players can start with a more peaceful tutor-mode game before the full on strategy game with the full card set.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Placing your positions to hold key areas of movement or setting up interlocking fields of fire will require the use of different tactics to keep the enemy at bay. Your opponent will have to employ various strategies to attempt to overwhelm your positions. Will he resort to rushing your position with a handful of grenades? Or will he try to set up a fire base and overwhelm you with more firepower? Or will your machine guns pin him down while the artillery you called from your Field Telephone falls on him from overhead.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Each of the foxholes comes with it's own set of Story Cards, adding new Story Events for each position, and comes with new Order Cards tasking you to Hold your position . A Field Telephone can even be added to a position to call in off board Mortar or Artillery support to help in your defense.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Each piece comes fully illustrated with easy assembly instructions. All of the terrain is made from the same high quality, sturdy material as your SMG maps so you know that you are receiving a highly durable product that can give you years of enjoyment.&quot;<br/><br/>Terrain ups the level of game play by introducing new elements of strategy and planning into the game through use of 3D terrain.  New scenarios are included surrounding the new terrain involved.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Column Line And Square (CLS) is a game of war set in the period of Napoleon (1808-1815). It was written by &quot;The 30mm Midwestern Napoleonic Wargamers Confederation.&quot; Most of the research and rule-writing was by Fred Vietmeyer, with additional input by Dave Mort and Hugh Reynolds.<br/><br/>CLS-II (aka the second edition) was photocopied typed text, about 100 pages. In addition, and almost mandatory at our games, was the addendum, the &quot;3R&quot; (Reviewed Referee Rulings) which documented the 'official' resolution of most rules disputes. There were also 'Optional Rules', 'Potential, Optional Rules', and 'Local Optional Rules'. I've got two three-ring binders given over to the rules and add-ons (and I quit keeping the add-ons long before we broke up).<br/><br/>CLS-III, also called The Battle Book, was a commercially available distillation of the above into about 100 pages. I can't remember who published it - it's out of print and unavailable. Fred still holds the copyright, but I doubt that it will ever see the light of day again.<br/><br/>I played CLS for about 20 years, from the mid '60s to the mid '80s; we broke up as a group in 1987 or 1988.<br/><br/>The rule set is a grand tactical set, using a 20 to 1 ratio (roughly) based on roster and unit strengths in the Spanish battles. The normal game was for 7 turns, using map marking and simultaneous movement. The typical command for a player would be a regiment of cavalry, two regiments of infantry, and a battery - about 220 to 280 castings. The basic map and maneuver units were the battalion and the squadron, with light infantry as an exception, run as either a formed battalion or as individual platoons of skirmishers (two, three, or four castings to the platoon, depending upon nationality).<br/><br/>--description from <a target='_blank' href=\"http://theminiaturespage.com/rules/nap/cls.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://theminiaturespage.com/rules/nap/cls.html</a><br/><br/>",

However, they had one significant request: replace the &quot;bonus building&quot; card that features Moscow's Red Square with a Ukraine-centric landmark. Honoring their wishes, our partner reached out to the game's artist who illustrated a vibrant scene that incorporates the iconic Golden Gate of Kyiv along with a monument of Yaroslav the Wise (one of the most famous princes of Kyiv). But just as production was about to start, the conflict escalated, leading up to the tragic situation we now know. As a result, Happy City cannot be released in Ukraine.<br/>Inspired by the actions of our dear partners at Cocktail Games and believing that every little bit helps, we decided to translate this symbolic card into English and offer it as a special release in solidarity with the citizens of Ukraine.

The mini game can be played solo (damage as much of the car as possible) or Versus other player (Each combatant race to damage as much of the car before their oponents). <br/>The Car Bonus Stage add an additional movement option to help player compete with their oponents. If a character's figure enters a space occupied by an oposing figure, they may move the opposing figure a number of spaces equal to their remaining movement points. <br/>Players attack the car by playing attack cards as a normal action. Once a damaged tile has 3 damage, it immediately flips over to its damaged side. Once the damaged side takes 3 more damage, it is removed from the board.<br/>Players may not damage each other.<br/><br/>The Capcom Cup:<br/>The Capcom cup is a 1 versus 1 tournament style game mode.  Each player choose 3 characters. All paired players share their character cards with their oponent. They blindly remove one of the character, and return the cards to each other. Player then pick their fighter for the round out of the remaining ones.<br/>Swiss round now begin: Use normal set up and 1 vs 1 rules. After a player is defeated, he may switch to his other fighter. The winner of the first round must stay with their current fighter until they lose. Once a player has won 2 rounds, they are the victor. <br/>After a certain amount of swiss round depending of the amount of players at the start of the tournament, the Top cut rounds starts. These are played similar to Swiss round. Players are paired based on Swiss results: Top ranked players vs lowest ranked player. Player that lose the Top Cut rounds are eliminated until only one player is left.<br/><br/>",

However, the isolation of the last war caused the corporation to wither, and the various outposts and colonies were eventually left to look after themselves. Some became true collectives, or limited democracies, while others have fallen to the rule of gangsters, warlords, and despots. In all cases, the limited resources of air and organic material has made life difficult.<br/><br/>In this supplement for Stargrave, the crews must travel from asteroid-to-asteroid, and even down to the system's single, barely inhabitable planet, searching for a man who claims to have discovered a &lsquo;big score'. During their journey, players will fight through numerous different environments - including asteroid mines, zero gravity, and even hellish jungle. Captains must curry favour with the various small political factions that hold power in the Belt. Only through a combination of wits, diplomacy, and weapons can players hope to reach the last prospector and gain a share of his claim&hellip;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "KING OF THE BATTLEFIELD<br/><br/>On February 5, 2439, the Mackie obliterated all opposition during its first combat trial, ushering in a new era of warfare. The BattleMech&mdash;King of the Battlefield&mdash;was born. BattleMechs reached their pinnacle during the golden age of the Star League. The fall of the Star League and the Succession Wars that raged for centuries afterward took their toll and by the Fourth Succession War, the technology employed on the battlefields was a mere shadow of what it once was. However, the discovery of the Helm Memory Core unlocked the technological potential to develop new BattleMechs and experimental technologies for the first time in centuries.<br/><br/>Technical Readout: Succession Wars is the perfect &quot;first Technical Readout&quot; companion to the BattleMech Manual. Combining the &rsquo;Mechs previously found in Technical Readout: 3039, Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade, Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade, and Technical Readout: 3075, this volume features some of the most common &rsquo;Mechs from the Age of War to the Succession Wars. Each machine is illustrated in detail, and accompanied by a description of its history, capabilities, game stats, along with their most famous pilots.<br/><br/>Note: This is a compilation volume. The entries in this book are reprinted from Technical Readout: 3039, Technical Readout: 3050 Upgrade, Technical Readout: 3058 Upgrade, and Technical Readout: 3075. Players who own those Technical Readouts will find the same units presented in Technical Readout: Succession Wars.<br/><br/>",

The puck is a small round magnet.<br/><br/>On your turn you get three flicks of your pieces. These can be used to pass the puck to an open player, shoot on goal, or just be a goon and smack your opponents pieces out of position. Be careful. If you're caught offside you might be stuck spending your turn flicking your players back across the blue line.<br/><br/>",

Able to shrink to microscopic sizes thanks to Hank Pym's signature Pym Particles, Lang is also able to communicate with ants and other insects via the specially designed helmet of the Ant-Man suit. Evil-doers everywhere have plenty of reason to fear the tiny, yet mighty Ant-Man!<br/><br/>A founding member of the Avengers, Janet Van Dyne has earned her place among the ranks of the world's most beloved and celebrated heroes as the Wasp. Like Ant-Man, Janet is able to alter her size thanks to command over Pym Particles, and also has the ability to generate bio-electric blasts that debilitate and sting her foes, while the wings of her specially designed suit allow her to deftly evade and attack her enemies with ease.<br/><br/>Marvel: Crisis Protocol &ndash; Ant-Man &amp; Wasp contains a miniature of each character, a miniature miniature of each character, two character stat cards, three team tactic cards, and ten tokens.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This second game in the Shields &amp; Swords Ancients series recreates ten battles spanning nearly three hundred years of Roman history. As was the case with the first game, With It Or On It (2019), The Grass Crown is a fresh, innovative taken on familiar material. The primary unit of maneuver is a &quot;Wing&quot; which itself consists of ten or so individual counters. Losses can be resolved by flipping the individual unit that was attacked, or by flipping any unit adjacent to it. Unrelenting pressure in the right places can prompt a Rout Check, causing the line to collapse. As the result of a single attack, multiple units can find themselves in your dead pile.<br/><br/>This simple but compelling theme sees many variations thanks to special rules that chart the evolution of Roman warfare, and contrasts them with the rigid Greek Phalanx, the sophisticated army of Hannibal, and the ferocity of the Gauls.<br/><br/>The ten battles are: Heraclea, Asculum, Trebbia, Zama, Pydna, Second Citra, Vercellae, Pharsalus, Thapsus, and Munda.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On The Green Golf is a hole-by-hole simulation that brings together the detail of a shot-by-shot game with the quick-play of a round-by-round game.<br/><br/>Golfers are rated for their ability to reach greens in regulation, going for the green, sand saves, and eagles.  Holes are rated for their effect on scoring, and have been painstakingly rated to account for the major hazards and features that will challenge golfers.<br/><br/>The game includes an optional (but highly recommended) weather system that modifies dice rolls for weather and wind, pin placements, and user setting of rough (although a die roll could also make that determination).<br/><br/>There is also a QuickPlay system that allows players the ability to play a round in just three dice rolls for each golfer.  This gives players the opportunity to complete entire tournaments in a reasonable amount of time.<br/><br/>And the best part about the QuickPlay system is that you can mix-and-match the three QuickPlay options (full round, nine-hole version, and six-hole version) to QuickPlay some of each round, then switch to the regular game to play out exciting finishes.<br/><br/>The game comes with the following:<br/><br/>-- 2005 men's golfer set (202 cards)<br/>-- Six courses (Augusta, Baltusrol, The Belfry, Pinehurst, Sawgrass, and St. Andrews)<br/>-- Weather and Course Condition Cards<br/>-- Suspense Charts<br/>-- QuickPlay Charts for all six courses<br/>-- Rules<br/><br/>The game is available in two formats:<br/><br/>1) E-Game Format via Hot Stove Games:  We send you the files, you print the components using your own equipment or local print shop.  E-mail us at hotstovegames@yahoo.com for ordering information.<br/><br/>2) Printed Format via Downey Games:  You receive a full-color, printed version of the game with die-cut golfer and course cards, sent to you in a sturdy storage box.

        "description": "Pedigree is a board game based on actual genetic biology and real-life decisions of animal breeding to produce show ring champions and top-dollar animals. Each player is a breeder trying to make the most money by raising the best animals and building reputation through winning trophies. Your ability to breed champion stock will be determined by your management and mating decisions, along with the luck of genetics. You pick the best animals based on their phenotype (appearance), but their phenotype is an imperfect predictor of their genotype (DNA). You won&rsquo;t find out the true genetic potential of the animal (prove the animal) until they produce offspring; unless you use DNA testing in advance.  Each generation you compete for the Trophy against other players in the Show Ring, and champions build your breeder reputation causing your animals to command higher prices.<br/><br/>A hand-management game where you're managing two hands of cards. Your Action Cards allow you to choose to mitigate disease, advertise, use biotechnology, hire a groom to help you win the trophy, plus other useful actions.  Your Animal Cards are where you choose which matings to make and which offspring to sell or keep for breeding.  You play one of four unique player roles (Manager, Showman, Technician, Veterinarian), each having a slightly different set of Action Cards.  The genetic-based game mechanic means that you are often faced with the decision to breed a proven animal or take your chance with an unproven animal.  The game is played over five years with each year consisting of six season:<br/><br/>     Planning season - choose your action cards for the year.<br/>     Breeding season - breed your females to your own sire or pay another player to use their sire.<br/>     Gestation season - pay your annual feed bill, find out if disease hits.<br/>     Birthing season - prove unproven parents and birth the new offspring.<br/>     Show season - take your best new offspring to the show and compete against other players for the trophy.<br/>     Market season - decide which offspring or parents you will keep versus sell to the bank or other players.<br/><br/><br/>The Action Cards that you play in one year must be discarded at the start of the next year, until you choose to play the Hired Hand card which retrieves all discarded Action Cards back to your hand. There are five trophies total, one is awarded each year, and when the trophies are gone, the game is over and whoever has accumulated the most wealth wins.<br/><br/>The base game includes a cattle Animal Card deck, but future Animal Card decks may include horses, dogs, sheep, goats, and others, including specific breed decks.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Possible combatants include Russia, various Middle Eastern states, China, Iran and the Persian Gulf countries.<br/><br/>The game system models the situation at the highest strategic level using a variation of Tv Bomba's &quot;Putin's War&quot; (MW #29). Each hex on the map represents 62 miles (100 km) and each turn of play represents anything from three days of intense combat to a couple weeks of refitting Ground units represent mostly corps sized formations with some divisional task forces. Special forces units are regiments, brigades or groupings of cadres. The combat aircraft units represent various numbers of sorties needed to accomplish missions over the time frame of a turn. The game system models operations in a vast theater with limited infrastructure and coalition forces which have divergent political aims with the objective of each player being to seize critical resource, logistics and communications centers, thereby gaining control of the Middle East.<br/><br/>You can use your pool of SOF to give conventional units shifts in combat, but this expends them for a random number of turns. So you have to plan out your SOF allocation. Also, seizing bases is vital, as their occupation can provide additional action points.<br/><br/>Principally from the game promo in MW#39<br/><br/>Game contained with Modern War #39.<br/><br/>",

One player represents the German army and the other the Soviet army. The final chapter in the destruction of  Third Reich began on April when  Stalin unleashed the brutal power of  20 armies, 6,300 tanks and 8,500 aircraft  with the objective  of  crushing  German  resistance and  capturing  Berlin.  The depleted  German forces put  up a stiff  defense, initially  repelling the  attacking Russians, but  ultimately succumbing to  overwhelming  force. The  Soviet army  surrounded the city  slowly tightening its stranglehold on the remaining defenders. Fighting street-to-street and house-to-house, Russian troops blasted their way towards the city's center.<br/>Game&rsquo;s Goal<br/>The Soviet army must reach the Reichstag and defeat the defending German troops at that area by outnumbering them by at least 2 to 1. The German player must defend the city and prevent the arriving Soviet troops from taking over the Reichstag (German Headquarters).<br/><br/>Game contents<br/><br/>-A Board with a map of Berlin divided into 23 numbered zones (called districts) and Ground Zero in the center, composed of an additional 5 districts. <br/>-64 counters &ndash;[(One counter represents a regiment or division (3,000 to 10,000 men)]: <br/>34  red, representing the Soviet invading forces (Russians, Ukrainians, Poles, etc.), <br/>22  grey and 5  black (Waffen SS), representing the combined troops of Germans.<br/>2  counters representing barricades (only in play on board if the German player draws event card &ldquo;barricades&rdquo;).<br/>1 colorless marker cube.<br/>-50 event cards. 25 for Germans and 25 for Soviets<br/><br/>source: game designer<br/><br/>&quot;Berl&iacute;n 1945 (La ca&iacute;da del Reichstag)&quot; es un juego para dos personas que recrea la batalla de Berl&iacute;n 24 abril-2 mayo de 1945, la &uacute;ltima gran batalla y el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. <br/>Un jugador representa al ej&eacute;rcito alem&aacute;n y otro al ej&eacute;rcito sovi&eacute;tico.<br/><br/>Objetivo del juego<br/>El ej&eacute;rcito sovi&eacute;tico debe alcanzar y derrotar a las tropas alemanas y el cuartel general situado en la zona del Reichstag.

        "description": "The Witchborn: Enter Perdition is the immersive campaign-based miniature skirmish game for 2-6 players (miniatures for 2 players supplied in the core box). Each player creates a war clan of adventurers to explore the dangerous world of Perdition. Portray your warriors with detailed 28mm Reaper&reg; Bones miniatures. Play campaign-style, where your warriors continually develop, find treasures, and level up between games&mdash;If they survive the perils of the adventure and the ever bloodthirsty undead - WitchBorn - of course.<br/><br/>&bull; 32 Reaper&reg; Bones miniatures (8 Elves, 8 Dwarves and 16 plains denizens) <br/>&bull; Adventure guide, gorgeous 46&rdquo; x 39&rdquo; battlemap, and app to run the adventure<br/>&bull; 6 war clans books and 6 customizable rosters<br/>&bull; Campaign Rules for your continuing adventures<br/>&bull; Quick Start Rules to get you playing faster<br/>&bull; dice, condition markers, turn chits, combat rulers, and over 90 templates<br/><br/>The Witchborn: Enter Perdition includes 16 Reaper Bones miniatures and rules to build Dwarven or Elven war clans and 16 plains denizens monster miniatures which might appear during the adventures. The box also includes rules to for Guild, Norn, Orc and Paladin war clans (miniatures for these are NOT included in the core box but are available as The Witchborn: War Clans edition). The game can be played with whatever suitable 28-32mm models you may have lying around. Also included is the highly replayable Enter Perdition adventure, with unique battle map and rules and all the tokens and dice you need to play the game.<br/><br/>After its creation your war clan participates in a true &ldquo;campaign game&rdquo; with an expanding series of adventures. Each adventure has its own 46&rdquo; x 39&rdquo; battlemap depicting an exotic locale. The adventures are highly replayable and more adventures are available as expansions. In the adventure included in the box an airship crashes in the Kasel Plains, jettisoning potentially valuable cargo. Each player leads their war clan in a search for the treasure&mdash;but needs caution. The once gentle centaurs of the plains are all WitchBorn now.<br/><br/>During missions warriors&rsquo; discoveries, wounds, and horrible fumbles are handled by apps for Android or iOS which tell a unique story every time you play. Smart phone apps take the place of a game master or an overlord, guiding players through a variety of random encounters.<br/><br/>Once a war clan escapes the battlemap with the airship cargo, players adjust their rosters. The war clan roster is the central tool that allows warriors to level up and change after each adventure. Players spend money they earn to choose from hundreds of items to equip their war clans. The roster tracks changes, so players can watch their characters develop from inept beginnings to their rise as dominant heroes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "SOLAR STARFIRE is the sixth edition of the Starfire series. Starfire has two parts: tactical combat and a strategic campaign system.<br/><br/>The tactical combat is a fast paced, fleet-level starship combat system with both a tactical level and an operational level. The tactical level is where starships engage in ship-to-ship combat around planets and warp points. The operational level is where you maneuver your fleet of starships across a star system to find where your enemy is hiding. Starship designs are simple, easy to create, and the combat system is quick enough to let players destroy dozens of starships in an evening.<br/><br/>The campaign system allows a player to start an empire and control all aspects of expansion: research, construction, colonization, exploration, etc. in an attempt to build an empire. Designed with procedurally generated system generation and a non-player race generation, each campaign is literally unique. The campaign system has been made to be easily modified for custom games and the rules have a hundred additional pages of source materials to help create those custom games.<br/><br/>Originally started as an upgrade of the Ultra Starfire rules, Solar Starfire is based on Ultra Starfire and has become a living work with new goals and purpose. The rules are being built by a new team of developers that have plans to continuously adapt and upgrade the game with new material, new release methods, and most of all - the new storyline. Solar Starfire was built specifically for the history of the Terran Solar Union and will continue to be expanded as the story line opens up new possibilities.<br/><br/>Still using the unique tactical combat system designed in 1976, Solar Starfire is the same core gaming system as Starfire has always been. The new team is building free starter materials for new players to learn and demo the Starfire system, while the website maintains a community forum and a FREE downloads section with player-created materials and previously-available gaming materials for most editions of Starfire.<br/><br/>",

In the Wurrgog Prophet Hedkrakka, the self-proclaimed 'Gob of Gork', this connection is especially strong. Hearing the Great Green God's command through his serpent familiar, Hedkrakka led his Madmob far across the realm of Ghur, seeking a beast of truly colossal proportions.

There are eighteen identical cards called captains, which are light on one side and dark on the other.<br/><br/>The players (starting with the black player) will take turns, placing cards of their assigned colour facing up, to the board. During a play, any cards of the opponent's colour that are in a straight line and bounded by the card just placed and another card of the current player's colour are turned over to the current player's colour.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to have the majority of cards turned to display your colour when the last playable card is placed.<br/><br/>Setup<br/>Deal seven cards to each player. Decide which player will play black and which white. The remaining four cards are placed in a two by two square in the middle of the table in between the players. The cards should alter the white side and black side so that two black card sides and two white card sides are facing upwards. The cards are placed so that the dark is diagonal to the same kind and vice versa.<br/><br/>The grid<br/>The four by four (4x4) invisible and floating grid is formed by the cards placed and may shift during play. Players must place their card adjacent next to another card on the board. The card could both be placed side to side and corner to corner. As soon as there are four rows of four columns of cards the placement options are limited. You may never place a card so it forms a fifth row or column if you are not able to clear a row or column of cards from the board.<br/><br/>Clear a column or row<br/>If you place a card in a position so there forms either a fifth row or column, you must remove the opposite row or column. But you could only remove a row or column that consists of as many or fewer cards as you just flipped over. If the row or column on the opposite side is of more cards than you would manage to flip, it could not be removed, and you would not be allowed to place your card in this position. Cards removed from the board is returned to the players' hands. If you are not able to shift the grid, you must place your card within the current.<br/><br/>Game endings<br/>The game ends when a player cannot place a card so that cards on the table are flipped over OR when the grid is completed and the player can not add a new card. In the latter case, the player would need to be able to shift the grid and remove a column or a row.<br/><br/>The player with most of its own colour facing up is the winner of the game. If there is a tie of colours facing up, the game ended in a tie.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It formed part of later operations in the War of the Austrian Succession. The result was a victory for the Austrian forces, led by Prince Josef Wenzel - Prince Franz Josef I and Louis-Joseph de Montcalm were among the notable combatants.<br/><br/>The War of the Austrian Succession (1740 - 1748) was a dynastic war, initiated by the European powers to counter the legitimate claim of Maria Theresa Habsburgs (1717-1780) to maintain control of all her family possessions, when her father, the Emperor Charles VI, died in 1740.<br/><br/>Federick II of Prussia was the first to act. He invaded Silesia as he wanted to reach a glorious military success and the beginning of his reign. Maria Theresa reacted prompted, and two alliance sides formed for the war with all the major European countries and many minor states involved.<br/><br/>In 1745, the war extended to Italy, where France and Spain were in arms against Austria and her ally, Savoy. After a sound defeat near Alessandria, the following year the Austrian side soundly defeated the French-Spanish army at the Battle of Piacenza, which marked the end of the French-Spain attempts to defeat Maria in Italy: &quot;I want to hope that this event will dispel from the minds of my enemies the desire to totally banish myself from Italy&quot;<br/><br/>Highlights:<br/><br/>     regimental-level warfare in the Age of Reason<br/>     highly interactive sequence of play, focused on manoeuvre<br/>     formations move in &quot;linear mode&quot;, the typical way of fighting a battle at that time<br/>     a 22&quot; x 25&quot; fine-art map , based on ancient map of the battle<br/>     detailed order of battle<br/>     limited play time<br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     22&quot; x 25&quot; map of Piacenza and its southern area<br/>     216 5/8&quot; (large) die-cut counters<br/>     Rule booklet<br/>     Charts<br/>     Boxed<br/><br/><br/>",

Build effective fireteams and create or discover the land as you cross the war torn map and try to outflank, outmaneuver, and out gun the enemy. As any good leader, you must consider the individual strengths and weaknesses of your soldiers to make sure your Mission is a success.<br/> In one Mission, you must rescue or capture the Resistance soldier who has recovered secret plans and get them safely back to your camp. In another, you must parachute into the landing zone and capture the bridge in order to win the day. This 2-4 person game can be played within an hour, or track your soldiers across an entire campaign, awarding medals for courage and valor, while determining the ability of green troops coming in to replace lost heroes. Replay-ability is high since each encounter will vary based on Mission, fireteams, map builds, and general unpredictability of war. <br/> But these aren't just pieces on a board. You aren&rsquo;t just sending in soldier #2, but rather, you are sending in Corporal &ldquo;Pokey&rdquo; Johnston. His bio informs you that he's a down home roots kind of guy from Colorado. He hasn't been able to hit the broadside of a barn on this mission. However, you've been saving that &quot;Act of Valor&quot; card and you decide to play it with Corporal Johnston and he turns the tide of battle. These aren't just names on a roster. These aren't just numbers on a map. These are your men. These are your brothers in arms.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When it was commissioned, Imperial Research Station 37 was home to nearly 10,000 scientists and researchers working on a vast array of biological and chemical projects. Then, six months before the outbreak of the war, Station 37 went dark. No escape pods were launched and all attempts at communication went unanswered. Only a solitary, repeating broadcast filled the silence: &quot;This station is under quarantine - do not approach&rdquo;. When the war came, the station was forgotten, left to drift lifelessly in its empty system. Now, in the aftermath of the Last War, Station 37 has been rediscovered and its broadcast heard once more.<br/><br/>Quarantine 37 is a supplement for Stargrave in which players lead their crews into an abandoned space station, hunting for lost technology, unique research, and forgotten experiments. Compete with your opponents for these valuable resources across two competitive mini-campaigns, or venture into the vast maze of corridors and laboratories alone in the first Stargrave solo campaign. Also included are six new soldier types, new backgrounds and powers, terrifying additions to the bestiary, and a new advanced technology table packed with loot to help you in your adventures in the ravaged galaxy.<br/><br/>Soldier Types: Gunfighter, Mule, Q-Bot, Ravaged, Ravaged Trooper, Trophy Taker.<br/><br/>Backgrounds: Aristocrat, Hunter.<br/><br/>Powers: Beast Call, Crack shot, Contacts, Indifference, Inspiring, Investments, Study Prey, Weapon Maintenance.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Speakeasy will transport you to the roaring 1920s during the era of Prohibition. Manhattan was under the firm control of Lucky Luciano, a prominent mobster. To strengthen his grip on the territory, he implemented a well-structured system. He divided Manhattan into different districts, each assigned to a specific mobster responsible for handling their &quot;business&quot; operations.<br/><br/>In this worker-placement and card-management game, you take on the role of one of those mobsters, managing and operating your very own speakeasy empire in Manhattan. To do so, you'll need to use all your cunning and resources to stay ahead of the competition. As you improve your operation, become more infamous, and upgrade to more lavish speakeasies and even casinos, you'll attract the attention of the outside mafia and the police. You need to use your leverage to keep your business running and receive your share from Lucky Luciano.<br/><br/>You need to hire goons to help you take over Manhattan during this exciting and dangerous time. You can associate with outside mobsters &mdash; and even attack and rob rum runners to gain valuable resources to gain an edge over your rivals. You need to manage your cards carefully, placing your workers strategically to deliver illicit liquor and reach Manhattan's goals to earn income. You will cook your books to fill your safes with free tax money by achieving some goals.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal is simple: accumulate the most money and become the most successful mobster in the city. Do you have what it takes to rise to the top of the speakeasy scene and take over Manhattan during Prohibition? It's time to grab your fedora and find out in Speakeasy.<br/><br/>",

This scenario book expansion provides four new battles set during the same period in Ireland, utilizing the maps and counters from Great Heathen Army.<br/><br/>Cenn Fuait (917) finds the Irish on the offensive until the sudden arrival of enemy reinforcements turns it into a desperate rearguard action. Ath Cliath (919) sees six Irish Kings band together in a disastrous attempt to break Viking power. At Glen Mama (999), rivals Brian Boru and Mael Sechnaill join forces against the rebellious Mael Morda and Sigtrygg Silkbeard, with Dublin as the prize.<br/><br/>And finally, there's Clontarf (1014) - one of the most famous battles in Irish history. This is the big one, folks - the biggest and longest battle in the entirety of the Shields &amp; Swords II series, sprawling across two maps, with over fifty units on a side.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Israeli Whist is a trick taking standard deck playing card game. In Israel, the game is simply called Whist but differs from classical Whist in significant ways. There are no partnerships, trump is determined by a Bridge-like auction rather than last card dealt, and each player makes an Oh Hell!-like forecast of number of tricks to take.<br/><br/>Each hand of Israeli Whist includes an auction round to determine trump, a bidding round to specify number of tricks to take, and finally a card play round to determine who made their bid.<br/><br/>Players who missed their bid, score -10 points for each trick over or under their bid. Players who made their bid exactly, score 10 points plus a bonus of the number of tricks taken squared.  See variants for non-exponential scoring systems to reduce the likelihood of a runaway leader.<br/><br/>One appeal of Israeli Whist is that the ability to judge a hand's strength is more important than relying on luck to get a good hand. For example, consistently making your bid outweighs consistently winning the auction to name trump.<br/><br/>Although the standard game is for exactly four players, see the variant section for ways to accommodate 3-7 players.<br/><br/>",

Turn yourself into a legend by defeating the enemy, saving the ship, and having the most valuable loot in your hand...but if the ship does sink, be the pirate who survived to tell the tale by having the fewest cards in your hand so that you can be light enough to flee on the lifeboat.<br/><br/>In We're Sinking!, a 3-6 player, secret action-taking survival game, players take on the role of pirates on a ship under siege. As the ship takes damage, the crew must work together to repair the ship and defeat one of the threats &mdash; kraken, skeleton pirates, megalodon, or sirens &mdash; while keeping the ship from sinking.<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose one of four actions: Bucket decreases the current water level; Patch fixes breaches and busted cannon; Fire allows you to fire cannons at the enemy; and Plunder allows you to steal revealed loot cards. Players discuss and possibly bluff about which actions they should take, then they secretly choose their actions on hidden compass dials, place them face down, then reveal them simultaneously.<br/><br/>Will you or your fellow crew instead choose to selfishly pocket treasure as precious time runs out? If you can manage to take out the threat, the game ends, and you win if you have the largest treasure score. If the ship sinks before taking out the threat, you win by having the fewest cards in hand.<br/><br/>Players constantly make tough decisions as they change their strategies based on how close they think the ship is to sinking or how trustworthy their fellow mates ar(rrr)e.<br/><br/>",

Like Parker Bros. &quot;Can't Stop&quot;, the length of each track is proportional to the probability of the roll. Therefore, the  &quot;7&quot; peg must travel the greatest distance while the &quot;2&quot; and &quot;12&quot; (Queen) pegs need only travel three spaces to win. When a peg crosses the finish line unchallenged, each corresponding card in players' hands are worth a quarter of the pot.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "How to Host a Murder styled party game. No audio comes with these games, just clue booklets and party planner.<br/><br/>White Flag Over the Seven Seas -Or- Who Took Down the Tyrant?<br/><br/>This murder mystery game for 10 players is set during the last dinner on board the great luxury liner, only hours before it sank. Here's your chance to enter the world of Edwardian opulence, and see what it was like to be aboard one of the most famous ships of our time!<br/><br/>It's April 14, 1912, and you've been aboard that luxury liner deemed unsinkable, the R.M.S. Tyranic, sailing from Southampton to New York on her maiden voyage. Though some call it the &quot;Ship of Dreams,&quot; you soon learned it should be called the &quot;Ship of Schemes,&quot; especially after meeting Mr. Ty Rante, President of the White Flag Line. Tonight you've been invited to join him for an exquisite dinner party, one that could prove to be as chilling as the icebergs floating around the North Atlantic this time of year. So come inside to the First Class Dining Saloon, to a dinner just sparkling with Edwardian opulence.<br/>YOUR DINNER COMPANIONS INCLUDE:<br/><br/>Captain R. Eddy Touretire, is the dashing and daring captain of the R.M.S. Tyranic. Having enjoyed a long and distinguished naval career, the maiden voyage of the Tyranic will be the last for him. He'll be sad to say goodbye to the high seas and intends to retire to a small cottage by the British shoreline. Of course, he always wears his captain's uniform.<br/><br/>The Inextinguishable Milly Beige, as she's often called, earned her nickname after surviving 5 shipwrecks, 3 train collisions, one plane crash and a bad case of lockjaw. A radiant and ravishing member of the nouveau riche, she's an American millionairess who's not afraid to spend her estranged husband's money. She's always dressed to the nines and never goes anywhere without her lucky Egyptian statuette.<br/><br/>Countess Jewel S. Auplintee is one of the loveliest and most ladylike members of the Austrian aristocracy. Dignified and delicate, she is known for the abundance of jewels she's collected since childhood. As a Countess, she keeps apprised of the affairs of state, and doesn't believe that war is coming. Of course, she wears only elaborate, jewel-encrusted fashions.<br/><br/>Thurstan &quot;Thur&quot; D. Klaas is a freewheeling, free-spirited amateur artist, who was lucky enough to win a ticket aboard the Tyranic in a last minute poker game at a pub near the docks. A man who lives from dime to dime and dollar to dollar, Thur makes his living as he goes. Ruggedly handsome, he has the muscles to prove that he's used to hard labor. He wears the only clothes he owns - corduroy pants, a high-collar shirt and a tweed jacket - unless, of course, he should happen to borrow a tuxedo for dinner.<br/><br/>Primrose &quot;Prim&quot; Ann Propper is a governess by trade and responsible for the education and upbringing of the two young Morganstine children. Pretty and particular, she is a woman of high moral standards and comes with excellent references. She boarded Tyranic against her better judgment, having endured weeks of premonitions and omens, warning her that the ship will meet with disaster. She wears either high-collared, conservative clothing, or borrows an evening gown from her employer for dinner.<br/><br/>Dr. Grayden &quot;Gray&quot; V. Deeger is a German Egyptologist, famous for his survival of King Tuff's tomb. Having unearthed more than his share of gold and lapis-laden treasures, his exploits have made him famous in his country, with the Kaiser being his number one fan. Dr. Gray is often described as an eccentric intellectual, willing to sacrifice all for his science. He usually wears a tweed suit or a tuxedo for dinner.<br/><br/>Senorita Suelita &quot;Sue&quot; Parficial is a flashy, fiery and famous Flamenco dancer, a woman of both great grace and passion. Born in Chihuahua, Mexico, her parents sent her to Europe to study dance when she was a young girl. Now she has been summoned home to Mexico by her father, a wealthy cattle baron with strong political connections. Sue always wears the latest of Paris fashions, though they tend to be more flamboyant than most.<br/><br/>Father Morrosse O'Dreary is an Irish Catholic priest, known for his sermons on the sanctity of suffering. Once considered a candidate for pope hood, he now heads a small parish in the Irish countryside, at the Church of Our Lady of Incessant Anguish. Father O'Dreary always wears his priestly collar and black clothes, and discreetly carries a whiskey flask wherever he goes.<br/><br/>Lady Mya Arstite is an enchanting and elegant member of the British aristocracy. She is famous for her exquisite balls and lavish dinner parties, and is possibly the utmost socialite of the new century. Claiming to know anyone worth knowing in all of Europe, Lady Arstite is among the growing numbers who believe that war is inevitable. She wants to take one more pleasure cruise before the shells start flying. She wears only the most up-to-date evening gowns from Paris.<br/><br/>Earl of Teetom, Erle Grey is a rich and refined member of the English upper crust, who lives on the enormous medieval estate that has been in his family for centuries. Despite his nobility, the Earl is a businessman and owns his own tea-processing and food-packaging plant. Well-mannered and quick-witted, the Earl's dinner attire is strictly white tie and tails.<br/><br/>",

You move around the outer board, with some control over your direction at times. There are 3 sets of 3 monsters on each side. Each time you defeat a monster, you place a marker next to it and get some gold as a reward. The first player to defeat all 3 monsters in a group gets a substantial reward for doing so. Gold can be used to buy swords to increase your die rolls. When all the monster groups are defeated, the final group of monsters can be attacked. While the player who defeats the final set of monsters gets a very large bonus, the winner is the player with the most money.<br/><br/>",

The game is (Canadian) bilingual; judging by the quality of the English, I'd say the author and company are French.<br/><br/>The cards come in several colors and range from 1 to 10 pins, plus Strike, Free and Channel cards. Using two decks allow up to six to play.<br/><br/>In the &quot;300&quot; game (there are four more games), each player gets 10 cards. The discard deck is started with one card from the draw deck. On his turn, a player plays two cards in front of him (forming a bowling &quot;square&quot;), one from his hand, the other from either deck (in any sequence) --this is his score for this square.<br/>The two cards should not total more than 10 (a &quot;spare&quot;); if they do, the second card is a &quot;channel&quot; and placed in the discard deck.<br/>If the first card played is a Strike, the second card is ignored and discarded. If the second card is a Strike, however, it is again treated as a Channel.<br/>A Channel played first becomes a Spare if a Strike or 10 is played second. A Channel played second is a Channel.<br/>The 10 is a Spare if preceded by a Free (which otherwise replaces any other card); a 10 can be discarded when played second. A 10 played first forces the second card to be discarded and scores zero (two Channels).<br/>A square of 6-9 deducts 10 points from one's score.<br/>A perfect game scores 300 points, hence the name.<br/><br/>",

The game was included as an insert to Shadis Magazine #36:<br/><br/>From the Introduction<br/><br/>Welcome to Indiana Jones and the Wrath of Hecate, the game of narrow escapes and rumpled fedoras starring everyone's favorite archeologist.  Wrath is a solitaire game in three parts, designed to be played in a few hours; the player takes the role of Indiana Jones and his sidekick Ko as they attempt to thwart another dastardly Nazi plot to take over the world.<br/><br/>Part One: Secrets Revealed:<br/><br/>GOAL: Indy has entered the cult's tomb in search of a mystic cerimonial dagger.  He must reach the central chamber and grab the dagger, then exit the Temple by moving back to the entrance.<br/><br/>PLAYER: selects path for Indy, rolling 2 dice to determine the number of action points for that turn, and navigates through the maze and various encounters.<br/><br/>Part Two: Chase to the Docks:<br/><br/>GOAL: The Nazis have plans for Hecate and don't want our heroes to spoil the party. Indy and Ko have to reach the Bantu Wind before they get turned into Swiss cheese. The road however, leads down a narrow canyon, so maneuvering options are limited.  To make matters worse, the floor is littered with rocks and other debris, turning an otherwise straight roadway into a deadly slalom.<br/><br/>PLAYER: navigates Indy and Ko's jeep down the canyon avoiding rocks and debris and the Nazis, utilizing action points.  Game uses a moving map to represent the trip (Indy needs to survive the 5 mile trip to the Bantu Wind.<br/><br/>Part Three: By Darkest Moonlight:<br/><br/>GOAL: The ceremony is underway, and Hecate will soon walk the Earth again. It's up to Indy and Ko to stop the ceremony from happening.  To do that they must fulfill two goals: Kill the Priest and rescue the Maiden.<br/><br/>PLAYER: uses Indy and Ko's action points to move around the map of the Temple of Hecate and disrupt the Nazi's reincarnation ceremony.<br/><br/>Each segment is played on a different board using a variety of pieces and straightforward game mechanics.<br/><br/>[NOTE:  Actually, the cover of this issue has a typo.  The cover says Issue 35, but it's actually Issue 36.  Throughout the inside of the magazine, it's listed as #36.  Therefore be careful when buying the magazine for this Indiana Jones game so that you get the issue you're looking for.]<br/><br/>",

In the game, students answer questions about conflict resolution and must use a win-win strategy to resolve conflicts.  It is designed for students in grades 5 - 8.<br/><br/>Players earn points in two ways.  They can earn points by answering questions correctly.  These questions come up when the players pick &quot;Conflict Resolution&quot; and &quot;True-Flase&quot; cards.  The game creates conflicts among the players and they can also win points by successfully resolving these conflicts.  As a result, the players are involved in two learning processes simultaneously - (1) learning the knowledge and skills for successful conflict resolution and (2) applying the knowledge and skills while playing the game.  Players are therefore cooperating in finding solutions and competing at the same time.  This dynamic relationship leads to a very exciting game.<br/><br/>(Taken from the rules book)<br/><br/>",

It measures 11.75 x 11.75 x 2 inches when in the case.<br/><br/>Inside the box is a spinner resting beneath a pane of glass. The directions are mounted underneath the glass. There are three &quot;answer inserts&quot; that hug the outer portion of the box, fitting around the glass. Three double-sided circular question cards are provided, each one corresponding to an answer insert.<br/><br/>After a question is asked, the question card is placed upon the glass pane and aligned such that the question asked is placed in the top (12 o'clock) position. The spinner is then magnetically moved, and points to the correct answer on the &quot;answer insert.&quot;<br/><br/>The directions read: &quot;In asking a question, place the Question Card so that it will fit exactly over this Disc, placing the question asked at the top, so that the dot on the edge will be directly opposite the dot on the top of this Disc, when the hand will immediately move in a quizzical manner, and in a few moments stop, and give the correct answer.&quot;<br/><br/>",

One was to provide a highly interactive game. The second was a degree of realism, not so much the detail of weapons, but more of the reactions and abilities of scared men led by a few less visibly scared. Lastly, it was to also take absolute control away from the player and provide uncertainty, have the men not always perform as well as desired.<br/><br/>Reprinted as Baptism of Fire II: WW2 to Modern Skirmish Gaming<br/><br/>",

Players set up rows of pieces blind to each other, maneuver around terrain features in the middle of the board, and capture pieces based on a set of value scale rules. However, there are some unusual twists even in the base game:<br/><br/>- A player can move forward to a space occupied by another player without attacking the piece.<br/><br/>- Attacks may only be made on a piece in front of yours, or in the same space.<br/><br/>- The submarine destroys anything it attacks, but is destroyed by anything that attacks it.<br/><br/>- There is no equivalent for the Stratego scout in movement for the basic game (but PT boats take on this role in the advanced game).<br/><br/>- There is an explicit victory condition for destroying both the opponent's minesweepers and still having a minefield directly in front of your Port.<br/><br/>Advanced rules add effects for shallow water, victory conditions based on point values of pieces, and unit repairs.<br/><br/>",

There are special spaces which are worth more points than the rest.<br/><br/>NineTacToe - 2 players play Tic-Tac-Toe on 9 grids simultaneously.

The &quot;Super Galactic Dreadnaughts&quot; also have their own detailed pictures and accompanying 'specs' for all of those. Each of them has their own 'description' and some more background information is provided for all of the 'participants'. The 'Entomalians' resemble a 'humanized Alien'(from the movie &quot;Alien&quot;), the 'Avarians' are a 'Birdman' species, the 'Aquarian' looks 'Reptilian'(Amphibian?), the 'Terran' like an 'Earthman', and the 'Carnivoran' looks to be some sort of bigger, badder, meaner looking &quot;Ewok&quot; sort of 'guy'! They were even given names, as such, but you can call them whatever you prefer, if you really, really, want to.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Starfleet Wars<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Three different game types included in this educational game. The base game comes with dozens of colored marbles to represent electrons, protons, neutrons, and photons. Also comes with a large board representing a the generic atomic structure of an element -- its nucleus and first five valence shell levels.<br/><br/>Game 1: Atomic Challenge<br/>In this game players use the marbles to simulate electrons, protons, and neutrons as they build and identify different atoms. The objective is to be the first player to use all of your marbles.<br/><br/>Game 2: Nuclear Reactions<br/>In this more advanced game, players score points by building neutral atoms, stable nuclei, and complete atoms that are both neutral and stable.<br/><br/>Game 3: Photons and Lasers<br/>This game teaches players how light is emitted and absorbed by atoms. The object of the game is to score points by playing cards and moving electrons up and down energy shell levels. Pump cards build the atom up to excited states, ready for scoring. Laser cards allow players to strategically move electrons down, scoring points, and simulating the emission of light from a real atom.<br/><br/>These games would work for grades 4-12 in an educational setting.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Command Quality Triumphs Over Superior Numbers!<br/><br/>Most WWII rules leave you wondering how the Germans ever won a battle.  Usually they fought out-numbered and against opponents with equal or superior equipment.  So how did they ever win? The answer lays in their outstanding unit-level leadership.  Kampfgruppe Commander places leadership quality  at the forefront.  Using the game's unique and fast-paced leader activation system, German units simply fight with more options and capabilities than their opponents.  And each allied army fights differently with its unique command abilities that develop as the war progresses.<br/><br/>Kampfgruppe Commander recreates all aspects of grand tactical mobile warfare using a scale of company-sized, multi-stand units.  Infantry battles are as fast-playing and interesting as tank duels.<br/><br/>The game's mechanics are fast and simple, yet full of historical flavor.  Small to medium sized games can be played in under two hours, or larger battles involving  whole divisions in an evening.<br/><br/>Suitable for all figure scales from micro to 20mm.<br/><br/>",

Seems complicated.<br/>Lots of different dice, coloured counters etc <br/>Basic Rules for 2 players<br/>Players will be called Captains. The toss of a coin will determine who will elect to bat or bowl first. You are now in a position to set up the board to commence play as outlined in Diagram 1. The bowling captain selects any one of his five bowlers and places him at either end of the pitch in the position marked &quot;bowler&quot;. The batting captain selects any two of his eleven batsmen and places one on the pitch as &quot;striker&quot; and the other as &quot;non-striker&quot;. The striker is placed on the opposite end of the pitch to the bowler.<br/>CRITICAL ASPECTS OF PLAY TO REMEMBER a)Study the layout of the board prior to commencement of play<br/>b) The bowling captain moves the yellow deliveries counter prior to each delivery. c) The bowling area must be cleared before casting of the dice. d) The batsmen in play must change ends on the scoring of one or three runs. e) It is the bowling captain's responsibility to complete the scoresheet. f) The batting captain is responsible for recording his batsmen's runs on the individual batsman's scoreboard. Extras are recorded by the bowler on the scoresheet. g) The three blue dice i.e. bye, wide and runout, once selected must be cast with the umpire dice. h) Once a batsman is dismissed the batting captain must advise the bowling captain of the runs scored before removing scoring counters from the individual batsmen's scoreboard. i) If a game is shortened to a lesser number of overs than fifty, it is essential that all five bowlers bowl the same number of overs each. DISMISSALS Batsmen can be dismissed in four ways: 1. Bowled 2. Caught 3. L.B.W 4. Run Out<br/><br/>",

Where Everyone Plays all the Time.&quot;<br/><br/>The game consists of an 8 second sand timer and 200 oversize cards each depicting either the top half or the bottom half of a colorful and humorous cartoon animal (such as Titus the skateboard riding elephant, Dolly the hula dancing penguin, or Howie the hockey playing monkey).  Play progresses as each player in turn draws a card from the shuffled deck and places it in plain view on the table. The player who's turn it is then has 8 seconds to find a matching pair of cards anywhere on the table and yell &quot;Connexus&quot; before play moves on to the next player.  But there's a catch!  Not every matching pair of cards will correctly fit together, as each card has either a tab or a slot on the edge where the two cards join.  For a match to count, one card must have a tab and the other a slot.    Legal matches are immediately removed from the board, however, mistakenly yelling &quot;Connexus&quot; without being able to make a match causes the player to forfeit one previously completed match.  Gameplay continues until one player has reached a predetermined number of matches.<br/><br/>The fast pace and the challenge of seeing and remembering all the cards and being able to locate them quickly enough to ensure that a potential matching pair will fit together are what make this game so exiting for all players involved.  Players must constantly be aware of their own cards as well as the other players' cards at all times in order to make matches.<br/><br/>I believe only a few proof of concept prototypes of this game were ever published which is a real shame because this game is one that can truly be enjoyed and played competitively by players of any age.<br/><br/>",

Try your hand as producer, director, screenwriter, comic and critic.<br/><br/>Have you always known you could make it big in Hollywood if you only had the chance?  Your chance is here.<br/><br/>You improvise dialog for the great movie stars, past and present.  Create and direct your own make-believe movies.  Produce the poster slogan that launches a blockbuster.  Write the stinging review for a box office bomb.  Compose the title for a new musical comedy.  Supply the punchline for the great screen comics.  Improve legendary film classics...and much, much more.<br/><br/>Each player writes answers to various questions, then scores points if 1) others vote for their piece, believing it to be the actual part; 2) they are able to pick the actual part, rather than those of their colleagues; or 3) disguise the actual part (as reader) so that people don't pick the actual movie clip.<br/><br/>",

When a player has used all tiles, he calls &quot;Go&quot; and everyone takes another tile.  This game sets itself apart from other similar real-time word games in that points don't come from the tiles used.  Instead, speed is most important.  Also, play is very flexible since all words do not need to be in a cross-word style grid.  You can have &quot;stray&quot; words or even multiple cross-words.  In a four-player game each player will have 25 tiles in their words.  Winning times have been recorded at under a minute and a half.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Slaughterloo is the game of massed armies involving the world of Valon, the fantasy world of Flintloque.  The game includes two volumes, the Rulebook and the Army Lists, as well as character figures for the Orc/British leader and the Elf/French leader, as well as dice and command cards needed for play.<br/><br/>You will need to put together your armies from the fantasy Napoleonic line produced by Alternative Armies for this and Flintloque/Deadloque.  While I bought it to play the game, I found it was very handy for Flintloque players as it contains a much more complete background on the world of Valon, as well as details on the uniforms of the different armies and races of the fantasy world.  Lots of photographs in color and black &amp; white give the player lots of details to help paint their units.  There is also a sample game with color photographs showing each phase and turn of a game to demonstrate the rules in action over a period of three turns.  The game recommends minimum units of divisions, made up of an average of 3 infantry units (around 20 figures each), one cavalry unit (of around 10 figures) and one artillery unit (one or two guns with crews, limbers, etc.), but suggests that each player can control a corps of 2 divisions.  I believe that you could play to learn the rules with just 2 or 3 units as you build your armies.  There is some player-to-player and distributer-to-player support available on an associated Yahoo group.<br/><br/>Description is based on the 2nd edition.<br/><br/>",

In this game you try to prevent the evil Olrik from obtaining a deadly device which can destroy the world.<br/><br/>A player gains points by saving cities. Each turn a player plays a card. First he/she follows the instructions of the card played. Then the player moves his/her pawn as many spaces as indicated on the card. When a player finds a deadly device, he or she looks secretly at the name of the city written on the device.<br/>If the city isn't threatened by Olrik, the player puts back the device. Otherwise the player places the deadly device in front of him/her. <br/>The the player takes an Olrik Execution Card and threaten a city and rotates the spinner. If the number is lower than the number of the city, it stays there and players can save the city. If not, the city is destroyed.<br/>If all cities are destroyed and/or saved the game ends. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Three other pieces on each side represent Earth's Moon and its orbital nodes.  The pieces are made of a plastic called Tenite (according to the rulebook) and resemble chess pieces topped with the traditional planetary symbols.<br/><br/>The pieces have movement powers reminiscent of those of chess pieces, but with some differences: several pieces have more than one way to move, one mode of movement - N squares at a time in any direction, repeated 3 times - is not found in standard chess, and generally speaking pieces are limited to moving a number of spaces equal to their relative position from the Sun plus 1 (e.g., the Earth piece can move 4 squares at a time).<br/><br/>The board is a 20x20 grid with a block of 40 unplayable spaces in the center.  There are special starred spaces on the board which are used by the pieces with weaker standard movement (Mercury and Helios) to teleport around the board.<br/><br/>Pieces are captured by landing on them.  The object is to put the opponent's Helios in checkmate (or &quot;total eclipse&quot;).<br/><br/>In addition to the rules themselves, the rulebook includes information on the gods and planets represented by the pieces.<br/><br/>",

Each player begins with one loyal world with a Governor and a hand of 7 chits drawn from the pool. The pool consists of 10 of each type of unit (except for two of the installations, of which there are only 5 each) and 2 each of several (optional) special chits that allow the holder to execute special actions.<br/><br/>There are four different types of units: Personalities(in two types: Public and Espionage), Military Units and Military Installations. There are 4 kinds of Espionage personalities, from Assassins to Rebel Leaders, and 3 kinds each of Public Personalities, Military Units and Military Installations.<br/><br/>Each unit has a set of possible actions to choose from. A Governor's actions, for example, are: Recruit-5; Deploy (Personality, Troops)-5; Subdue Uprising-3; while an Assassin has only one available action: Kill (Public Personality)-3. The number following each action indicates the chances out of six that the attempted action will be successful. Recruit allows you to draw a chit from the pool into your hand, while Deploy allows you to place a unit from your hand into play. Loyal worlds have a list of actions just as units do: Recruit-5; Deploy Base-4; Deploy Personality-4; Repair-2.<br/><br/>During the movement phase, a unit may move from its current world to any other world on the map. Military installations may not move. Troops cannot move on their own, but must be transported by Star Cruisers. Star Cruisers may be ordered to blockade a world; any enemy personality moving to a blockaded world risks being destroyed by the blockading cruiser.<br/><br/>Victory is achieved by gaining the loyalty of all ten worlds or by eliminating all enemy units from the map.<br/><br/>",

Look for the tile with the yellow star, where the little hare wakes up and sees the hunters coming, and put it in front of you. In the lower right corner there is a red circle. Look for all the tiles with a red circle in the lower left corner: there are two of them, one where the little hare goes back to his den and thinks about what to do, another in which he leaves the wood and goes to the city. Choose one and put it besides the first tile: for example, choose the one in which the hare goes to town. Do you see a black circle in the lower right corner? Look for all the tiles with the black circle on the left, choose the one you like more&hellip; and so on, until you reach the end of the story: a tile with a star on the right.<br/>Now you can show your story to everyone you like: your mum, a cousin, a friend&hellip; but showing it is not enough: you have to tell them your story. For example, why the hare goes to the city? Is he just scared of the hunters? Is he bored of his life in the wood? Is he curious about the city?<br/>When you are finished, you can start again with a new story, choosing different tiles: there are so many possibilities! And when you are expert, you can decide to put together tiles without caring of the symbols, or even draw new tiles using the blank ones you found in the box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ironclad is a commissioned game from Frank Lantz for the game design textbook &quot;Rules of Play&quot;, by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman.<br/><br/>Ironclad is played on a 6-by-8 checkerboard, using checkers on the spaces and go stones on the intersections.  The checkers represent battling armored robots, and the stones represent arguments in a philosophical disagreement between two logicians.  These two sub-games, battling robots and arguing philosophers, are played simultaneously on the same board.  You win by winning either sub-game.<br/><br/>In the robot sub-game, you start with your robots on your side of the board.  On each turn, you can either move a single robot or fire on an enemy robot with all the friendly robots that are within range.  You win if one of your robots reaches the opponent's side of the board.<br/><br/>In the philosophers sub-game, you attempt to make an unbroken string of stones in your color from one side of the board to the other.  On each turn, you place a single stone of your color, if possible. Otherwise, you move a single stone of either color.  If neither is possible, then your opponent wins.<br/><br/>The sub-games interact in two ways.  First, a stone cannot be played on the corner of a space containing a robot.  Second, if a space containing a robot has one or more stones on its corners, that robot receives a defensive bonus when attacked.<br/><br/>The most novel aspect of Ironclad lies in the choice of which sub-game to play in.  On each turn, a player makes two moves, one in each sub-game.  However, the player only gets to decide on the move in one of the sub-games.  The player's opponent gets to decide on the player's move in the other sub-game.  So the player chooses one of the sub-games and makes a move in that sub-game, then the opponent moves for the player in the other sub-game.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives a hand of nine cards showing either a player position (Defenseman, Wing, Thug, or Center) or an action (such as Hook, Line Change, Breakaway or Great Save) as well as a value.  Generally, players have higher values, but lack the special abilities given by action cards.<br/>To begin play, each player simultaneously plays reveals one card for the faceoff.  After seeing the opponent's play, each person chooses two other cards to add to their play. Whichever players set of 3 cards has the highest total value has the advantage and may take a shot.  A card from the draw pile is flipped over in order to decide if the shot was on goal and what the target number for success will be, then one more card is flipped over.  If the value of the second card, plus any modifiers from players cards such as Breakaway, or by having a much higher three card value than your opponent exceeds the target number, a goal has been scored.  If there is no goal, players check for penalties (if a Hook was played) or fights (if each team played a Thug), both of which are resolved by reducing the hand size of one of the players.<br/>Play continues with the cards in hand, even if one side is unable to play 3 cards from injury or penalties.  If at the start of a round, a player has no cards, they draw a new hand of nine (a Line Change).  Line Changes also occur after goals (for both teams) or by playing a Line Change card during a round.<br/>Once the deck is exhausted and not enough cards are left to complete a round, the period ends.  The player with the most goals after three periods wins.<br/><br/>",

The Communist forces hoped a popular uprising by the &quot;oppressed&quot; people in South Vietnam would lead to a general uprising and overthrow of the &quot;puppet&quot; regime supported by the United States. <br/>The city of Hue was the only city to be completely occupied by the communist forces during the massive offensive, and was the scene of violent and close-quarter fighting that waged for nearly a month, from January 31st to February 25th, 1968. The general uprising never occurred, and in fact the communist's disappointment led to atrocities when they massacred hundreds of &quot;collaborators&quot; after they took control. The fighting to retake control of the city and oust the NVA and VC devastated the city and Imperial Palace, symbolizing the tragic and confused nature of the war.<br/><br/>Players are cast in the roles of the commanders of each side's forces. Both players will have capabilities to inflict harm upon their opponent, while also having liabilities to protect. Contestants will be challenged to do as well, or better than, their historical counterparts.<br/><br/>Game Scale: The map scale is about 350-400 yards per inch. <br/>Each combat unit represents a platoon (25 to 30 men, 2 tanks or 6 APCs (Armored Personnel Carriers) and artillery batteries (M-109, Katyusha rockets, and mortars). <br/>A game turn represents 2-3 days of time.<br/><br/>",

It is a reimplementation of the traditional card game Golf with an additional &quot;Shiperio&quot; theft card.<br/><br/>The object of the game is the same as it is on the course... to shoot the lowest score. Cards range from an Ace up to the dreaded Snowman (an 8). Play nine holes or eighteen, it's up to you. Whether you're a scratch golfer, a hacker or have never picked up a golf club you'll love Shiperio. Just like on the course players will succeed with skill, strategy, and a little luck!<br/><br/>In golf, the term Shiperio is similar to a Mulligan where a player is allowed a second shot without penalty. The nice thing about a Shiperio is that, unlike a Mulligan, the golfer gets to choose which ball to play. In our game we have a card called the Shiperio Card . It's played quite similar to a Shiperio on the course. We liked the name so much we decided to name the game after it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Publisher's web site:<br/><br/>Welcome to a night of murder!  For 14 to 40 guests!<br/><br/>The Last Gasp is a Victorian murder mystery which runs for about three hours. Everyone taking part is given a character in the plot. As well as having a murder to investigate, characters will also have their own, secret objectives. Why does the church choir only accept female members? Where is the Earl hiding all his money? Can anyone persuade Captain Ratliffe to do the decent thing? At &quot;The Last Gasp&quot;, anything can happen - and generally does!<br/><br/>The Plot<br/><br/>It is New Year's Eve, 1899. George Sweet, the 5th Earl of Coddingham, has lead a wicked and dissolute life. His past is finally catching up with him and, eager to keep out of reach of the law, he is planning to flee abroad. Before he goes, he is holding one final party: &quot;The Last Gasp&quot;. Invited to it are all the people to whom his appalling behavior has brought the most grief and heartache: his ex-wives, Florence and Dawn, his present wife, Jojo, his ballet dancer son, William, and his long-suffering friend, Bernard. George is determined to use his party to make up for past mistakes.<br/><br/><br/>People from the Earl's local village and members of his staff are also at &quot;The Last Gasp&quot;: the local vicar is recruiting new members for the church choir, cavalry officer Captain Ratliffe is breaking a few more women's hearts, and Jarvis, the Earl's loyal butler, is making sure no one steals the sherry. The Earl's plans go slightly awry, however, when the police unexpectedly turn up, hoping to arrest someone for murder. Who do they want to arrest? The Earl of Coddingham....<br/><br/>We think this game is suitable for anyone 13 years old and over.

It's a game of pure chance...simply put in a coin, pull the lever and hope that the spinning symbols stop at the right combination. different combinations pay off at different odds. Charles Fey, a mechanic from San Francisco invented the slot machine. He made the first one (called &quot;Liberty Bell&quot;) in 1895 and rented it to a saloon for 50% of its profits. Mr Fey obviously understood the motivation that causes people to enjoy losing.<br/>Spot dice - the dice used in America's favorite game of chance, &quot;Craps&quot;, can be traced back as far as 1573 B.C., back to the crude sticks, bones and shells used by primitive man.<br/>Classic Games has taken these two basic gambling devices and combined them into a modern classic - &quot; Slots n' Spots&quot;. A game in wich the outrageous chances of the &quot;slots&quot; are paired with the predictable(?) roll of the dice.&quot;<br/><br/>The game box contain:<br/>- a dice cup<br/>- 3 special dice<br/>- 2 regular dice<br/>- score pad<br/>- Instructions<br/><br/>",

The cards tell the story of 8 thieves, each story consists of 5 parts. All parts are shuffled. Now, on a turn, a player can take 1 pile and look at the top 3 cards, choosing one of them (he doesn't have to take a card). As soon as someone has all 5 pieces of one story together, he wins the game. The problem is, that you have to take the parts in the right order, you don't know what parts the other players have (the parts 1 &amp; 2 are all three times available, 3 two times, the 4th and 5th part only once), so you have to memorize the right stacks.<br/><br/>",

Only one alien race was discovered, and that lone example of intelligence was conquered and enslaved. It was that victory, those acts, which sowed the seeds of mankind's greatest threat. On the verge of discovering that man was not supreme in the galaxy, humanity turned upon itself.<br/><br/>It was an age of idealism. It was an age of elitism. It was an age when man turned against man, confident in his own superiority. It was an age of ignorance... when man strode too proudly amongst the stars.<br/><br/>Included in this book is everything you need to play out the story of the Terran Civil War with the VBAM and Starmada X game systems, including: <br/> * Rules to model internal politics for VBAM<br/> * Expanded links between VBAM-Starmada abilities<br/> * Rules for designing new Starmada weapon systems<br/> * Expanded fighter design rules<br/> * New ground force design rules<br/> * New scouting options<br/> * New planetary facilities<br/> * Enhanced Starmada-VBAM scenario/setup rules<br/> * Expanded elite officer and crew rules<br/> * 27 Starmada ship designs<br/> * Complete orders of battle for &quot;historical&quot; play<br/> * In depth campaign setting and background<br/> * &quot;Historical&quot; scenarios for Starmada play<br/> * 50+ star systems, based loosely on real stellar cartography<br/><br/>THIS IS NOT A STAND ALONE PRODUCT AND REQUIRES THE Victory by Any Means: Campaign Guide(VBM-101) AND Victory by Any Means: The Starmada Edition (MJG-0113) TO FULLY USE.

        "description": "From Ee J. Frankel, Play It Again: Asian Games and Pastimes<br/><br/>&quot;The incense game or incense ceremony (k&ocirc;d&ocirc;) probably had its origin in the Heian Period when such aesthetic skills as the identification of fragrances became part of the training of aristocrats.  Gradually, literary themes became associated with certain fragrances.  Sometime in the following Muromachi period (1185-13??), the game evolved into a complicated pastime that required a larger variety of scents than previously used, and accommodated up to ten guests as participants.<br/>  By the early Edo period, the game reached new heights of popularity, probably due to the formalization of the tea ceremony, that also included the burning of incense.  During the eighteenth century, possibly because of a shortage of imported scented woods (k&ocirc;boku), the incense ceremony survived only among the very rich and wealthy merchants who also introduced a modified version of the game and its accoutrement's.  What follows is a description of the typical components of the Incense Game of the very early part of the Edo period (1615-1867).<br/>  The game is customarily played with four fragrances (in the form of pieces of scented wood), three of which are supplied by the host and one by a guest.  The three house scents are each divided into four portions that are placed in individual packets, making a total of twelve packets of house fragrances.  The guest fragrance is put into one packet, making a grand total of thirteen.<br/>  In the preliminary round, the three house fragrances are introduced and identified for the players (the guest fragrance remaining a mystery).  Then the game begins and is played out in ten rounds, during which each of the players attempts to distinguish the four possible scents they are currently being given to identify.<br/>  In the simplest form of the game, the preliminary round begins with the guests or players (usually highly literate people, sensitive to poetry) seated close enough together for the burning incense to be passed among them easily.  The host, who has prepared small pieces of burning charcoal in a larger burner, or k&ocirc;ro, lifts a piece of the red-hot charcoal with the proper tool, and buries it within the lacquered, ash-filled kikik&ocirc;ro (a special metal-lined container for this purpose), leaving over it only a thin covering layer of ash.  The ash is then smoothed and rounded into a cone with a spatula-like tool.<br/>  When the guests appear comfortable, the host opens one packet of the three house fragrances, gives it an identifying name such as &quot;Fragrance One&quot; and then places the perfumed wood on a mica square that is in turn placed on the heated ash.  The burner is then passed around for the guests to acquaint themselves with the fragrance.  Fragrance Two and Fragrance Three are then introduced and identified in the same manner.  After all three pieces of scented wood have been gently sniffed, each is placed on one of a set of plum-blossom-shaped rests provided for this purpose.  Then the game proper begins.<br/>  At this point ten packets of fragrance remain -- nine of house fragrances and one unknown -- and the players will now have to identify them without being told which is which.<br/>  Each player will have been provided with a set of counters or ballots, all of which have that player's identifying token (some tree or flower) on one side, and a possible choice (Fragrance One, Fragrance Two, Fragrance Three, or Unknown Fragrance) on the other.  As each new packet is opened and its contents placed in the burner and then passed around, each player chooses a counter that matches his or her guess about its identity and drops it into a receptacle provided for that purpose.  The burner is passed around again, the fragrances inhaled, and their identities guessed ten times.  Sometimes these actions may be accompanied by the scent or alluding to the floral picture on the player's ballot.  As the closed room quickly fills with lingering odors from previous rounds, the game becomes increasingly more difficult.<br/>  After each round the ballots are examined, and the players' guesses are written by brush on a record board. (Sometimes the ballots are put in an envelope until the game is completed and the guesses registered on the board at that time.) The winner is often awarded the record board.  Depending on the time available and the number of guests, a recess may be called and food served in another area.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "3-6 deductive space explorers take a couple of UFO's each, and travel between seven solar systems to meet the neighbors. When a rendezvous takes place, the visiting player needs to guess the local way to say &quot;hi&quot;, which is made through a sequence of gestures and salutations, 4 in all. Depending on how accurate a player's greeting is, that player will receive a gift, which gives a clue to how close the attempt was to the real McCoy. The question is, which mastermind can deduct all the secret alien handshakes?<br/><br/>The board shows six solar systems arranged in a circle. A seventh solar system is placed at the center of this. Each solar system has 13 planets orbiting a sun, in 3 orbits. Where solar systems touch each other, there are planets facing each other on the outer ring, creating places where UFOs can hop between systems. With the exception of the central system, each solar system has one distinctive home planet. There are unique 24 handshake cards, grouped in 4 sets of 6. Each player gets 5 gift counters.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player picks a home planet and places the two flying saucers on it. All players then get their unique 4 part hand-shake sequence, which gets written down on a private note sheet. Unused cards are exposed, so players can cross them off as possible candidates. Each player then allocates the values 0-4 to their 5 gifts, which is also written down on the sheet and kept hidden from opponents.<br/><br/>In turn, players can allocate between 1 and 4 movement points to their 2 UFO's, in any way they see fit. UFO's move clockwise from planet to planet, and are allowed to change orbit, and even solar system. Each planet offers room for only 2 UFO's though, and these have to belong to different players too. When 2 UFO's meet on the same planet, a rendezvous takes place.<br/><br/>The arriving player takes a guess (aloud) at the correct greeting sequence of the other alien. Depending the amount of correctly guessed elements, the alien will return a gift to this player. This gift has the same value as the amount of correct guesses, but what that value is, is another thing that has to be deduced by the other players. When a player has already handed over the gift with that value, the visiting player will be told that no gift can be made. All this information is available to all players.<br/><br/>Landing on another player's home planet opens up another opportunity to get that player to reveal another clue. When a player gives back a gift previously obtained from that tribe, the owner of the home planet must return a greeting that has the same value as the returned gift, but also one that has not been made before.<br/><br/>A players cannot establish a rendezvous between the same two spaceships in 2 subsequent turns, and must leave a solar system before another landing on the same home planet may be made.<br/><br/>When a player greets all other players with the correct salutations, than that player is the winner. You're only allowed one guess though, so don't expect it to be made fast.<br/><br/>This is a great addition to the deduction genre, sitting comfortably next to Cluedo and Mastermind, despite lower production values. With each additional player, game length increases a bit, and an alternative victory condition, guessing only the handshake of the players on your immediate left and right, is suggested for 5 and 6 player games. Where most of these games use indicators that give players direct clues about the accuracy of a guess (for instance, a red peg is a correct guess but not in its right place), here the added complication is that the true meaning of these pegs (the gifts) must also be established, setting player's quite a puzzling logic challenge.<br/><br/>Publication history: this game appeared in Spielbox magazine (1/1985 feb-mar), as one of the earlier entrants in the &quot;Spiel zum Herausnehmen/Game to Remove&quot; series. It was the runner up in Spielbox magazine's &quot;Invent-a-Game&quot; competition, losing out to Radar Flop. It clearly shows how designers can produce completely different games, despite starting off with a similar board and setting. Some assembly required.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This chess variation uses the traditional pieces but is played on a board with a different topology: it's as if the board were pinched together in the middle, or as if the board were centered over the north pole of a globe, so all moves from the 4th to 5th rank pass through the center point.  There is an extra file that prevents the two player's rooks from being adjacent; you cannot move through the outer two ranks of the file, you can move through but not stop in their inner two ranks. Diagonal moves for the bishops and queens are defined so that they make S-curves after passing through the center point, allowing for attacks that are hard to spot until you get used to them.<br/><br/>This set comes with a 2-sided board, a standard 8x8 board being on the other side; and it includes a checker set, so you can play Centre Checkers as well.  Rules are included for all 4 games, chess and checkers, traditional and Centre.<br/><br/>",

First player must roll a one or a four to move any of his playing pieces from BASE to START.  Play moves to the left.<br/><br/>2.  Once a playing piece has been placed on START, player may move four spaces, he is entitled to an additional turn.<br/><br/>3.  Each time a player rolls a four and is able to move four spaces, he is entitled to an additional turn.<br/><br/>4.  A player must roll the exact number to move his playing pieces into the HOME spaces.<br/><br/>5.  A player may not pass or land on one of his own playing pieces.<br/><br/>6.  When a player lands on a space occupied by ANOTHER PLAYER, he replaces that player's playing piece with his own and sends the other player's playing piece back to the matching base, where that player must start again.<br/><br/>BONUS:<br/>1.  When a player's roll of the die places his playing piece exactly on any of the six black BONUS spaces, around the center of the board, he may, on his next turn, choose to move that playing piece around the board, using the black BONUS spaces only and thus shorten the path to HOME.<br/><br/>2.  He moves the number of spaces as rolled, counting around the BONUS spaces until he reaches the row by his HOME and continuing down that row the remaining number on the die.<br/><br/>DOUBLE BONUS:<br/>1.  The center black space is a double bonus space that may be entered from any location on the board, by rolling the exact number to land there.<br/><br/>2.  In order to leave the double bonus space, a player must roll a one and he then proceeds to any of the six bonus spaces on the board.<br/>IN BOTH OF THE ABOVE BONUS CASES, IF A PLAYER LANDS ON A BONUS SPACE ALREADY OCCUPIED BY ANOTHER PLAYER, RULE 6 OF PLAY APPLIES.<br/><br/>TO WIN:  To be the first player to move all four playing pieces to the matching home is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Aircraft figures of 1:250 scale or smaller may be used.  Two 20-sided dice will be needed for play.  The game scale is 1' = 4 miles (1:24,000 scale) with each turn of play lasting two minutes.<br/><br/>Out of the 40 pages of the rulebook, only 10 pages are dedicated to actual rules of the game.  The remaining 30 pages detail all of the stats for each ship per country with a black  silhouette of each unit.  A naval forces inventory per country is also listed in the back.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Pentagon Game is a simple wargame on the Vietnam War. The four players (rules are also provided for two or three) represent the North Vietnamese Army (NVA), South Vietnamese Army (ARVN), Viet Cong (VC), and the US Armed Forces. There are also civilian units. The map shows North and South Vietnam plus adjacent areas on a square grid.<br/><br/>The system has more of the flavor of an abstract strategy game than a typical wargame. Units have low movement allowances (1 or 2), although regular armed forces can move greater distances by road or rail. Combat is deterministic.<br/><br/>Some of the VC player's units start mixed in with the civilian units, only he or she knowing which ones they are. To fight, they must be revealed. The US and ARVN players can attack civilians if they think they are VC, but if they are wrong the VC player gets to add more concealed VC to the game. If the VC/civilian ratio becomes too skewed the ARVN player is out of the game.<br/><br/>The goal for the NVA and VC players is to occupy a certain value of cities on South Vietnam. The US and ARVN players win by either occupying enough cities in North Vietnam and reducing the VC level, or by eliminating all overt VC units and clearing South Vietnam of NVA units.<br/><br/>There are some additional game elements, such as a deck of event cards which can be drawn in lieu of one's turn (or if an incursion of Laos occurs), reinforcements, and the possibility of Chinese Army forces entering.<br/><br/>The game is packaged in a red folder which pretends to be a CIA briefing folder. In addition to the game rules, the booklet inside the folder contains &quot;briefing&quot; materials - a time line of the Vietnam conflict, analysis of the phases of insurgency, and a (somewhat satirical) glossary. Attached to the folder are a counter sheet containing 782 counters (all the same color), a map, and a sheet of 28 event cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "<br/>        <br/>(From the publisher's website)<br/><br/>Scrapyard 500 is a fast-paced road race game in which players &quot;build&quot; race buggies, load them with weapons and compete in a no-holds-barred race around the Scraptown track. Playable either with the counters included in the rules or with 28mm scale miniatures and 1/35 scale vehicles, Scrapyard 500 offers five character types to choose from in building a race team, six weapons (everything from net guns for the pacifists to flame throwers and rocket launchers for those of a more lethal persuasion) plus a hex-based, build-it-yourself track that includes nine different hazard hexes that can be used to make a different track for each race. Rules are easy to learn and offer endless chaos and laughs. Remember, it's not how you win the race. It's winning that counts.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a card game by Joe Magic Games. The game is played with two custom decks of playing cards with renaissance art depicting medieval England. Kingdoms are set up on mats that define each player's domain.  Players attempt to manipulate the cards which represent different aspects of the court, including kings, queens, assassins, and spies.  They also manage population, treasury, and war.  <br/>The game includes pawns that indicate level of royalty, and advancement cards like: Longbow, Sanitation, and Chivalry.  Also, mixed in with the cards are events like Corruption, Peasant Revolt, and Black Death. The player who is the current ruler has the ability to tax and forbid other players to perform particular actions.  In this way, that player has more control over events, but also is a bigger target for war and assassination.<br/>The winner is the player who manages to survive two rounds by either having the only living population or being the ruler and only player with cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is Leader driven. His characteristics and qualities coupled with circumstances will dictate what a force can and cannot do. The closer you are to supplies, the more you can do- unfortunately you can&rsquo;t win by sitting in a supply depot.<br/>A turn is played in operations. Players alternate operating with a force and Leader of their choosing, trying to outmaneuver their opponents and lever them out of commanding positions, opening up strategic objectives. Beware; although you may be only a mile or so from your objective, stretched supply lines, bands of guerrilla fighters and incompetent Generals can force a sudden retreat, undoing careful planning.<br/><br/>The board is divided into supply areas (color coded) that can change due to territorial acquisitions. While the British begin with excellent supplies near Lake Ontario, the loss of Fort George can mean restricted movement in your own heartland. If the Americans lose Fort Schlosser, the British will have a free hand marching to Black Rock or Buffalo, causing the Americans to retire in shame from the Canadian side.<br/><br/>Battles, Skirmishes, and guerrilla activity not only leads to the loss of men, but of confidence, and an army that loses hope will degenerate into an armed mob, incapable of organized action. Both sides were determined during this campaign, so battles tended to be hard fought, and cause high casualties, even among the Generals.<br/><br/>The Scale<br/><br/>The Niagara region in not a huge one. An army could march from the top to the bottom in two days (in peacetime).We use two day turns, which allows for the tiniest of actions and moves to be of significance. As far as troop scale is concerned all units used in play are called Detachments, which represent between 100-200 men. Thus the British 100th<br/>regiment (roughly 600 men) is composed of four detachments.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Queens' Gambit: Italy 1742-48 - Volume IV in the Lace Wars series<br/><br/>Queens' Gambit (QG) is the fourth volume of Red Sash Games Lace Wars series. Like its predecessors, Sport of Kings, Cockpit of Europe and Charlie's Year, it examines the War of the Austrian Succession at an operational level. Italy is the stage this time. Physically isolated from the titanic struggles in Germany and the Low Countries, Italy was anything but a backwater: successes and failures here had an important impact on the war as a whole. The war for Italy opened at the beginning of 1742. The Spanish Crown, after lengthy preparations, successfully invaded Italy by sea, bent on acquiring a duchy for the Queen's son, Don Felipe, and on reclaiming Spanish dominance in the region. Distracted by events elsewhere, the Habsburgs and their British allies were unable to prevent this move, but soon rebounded, drawing as a reluctant partner the pre-eminent local power, Piedmont-Sardinia, and its Frederician-like ruler, Charles Emmanuel of the House of Savoy.<br/><br/>QG can accommodate up to four players, though it is easily played with two, and can even be played solitaire. The four sides are Bourbon France, Bourbon Spain, the Habsburg Empire, and Savoy (Piedmont-Sardinia). Also available are the forces of Genoa, Modena, Venice, Naples, and some pesky Royal Marines. Other territories, like the Papal States, wield influence rather than the sword.<br/><br/>A game on the War of Austrian Succession in Italy. In the same serie as Sport of Kings, Cockpit of Europe and Charlie's Year (Lace Wars). Both DTP and mounted versions exist.<br/><br/>Map scale is 8.5 miles per hex. Most units are brigades. Units are rated for Strength (in battalions),<br/><br/>- 6 maps<br/>- Three books<br/>- Charts<br/>- 1200 counters in 10 counter sheets (incl. markers)<br/><br/>",

In turn, a player rolls the dice and advances one&rsquo;s own pawn on the track and react to where ever the pawn lands. During the course of play a player may buy and use service stations and garages, purchase insurance, get involved in accidents, collect income and get stars, which represent safe driving awards. When a player buys a second car, that player takes two consecutive turns even though one still has only one pawn on the gameboard. A player who buys a third car may take three consecutive turns.<br/><br/>The path the players travel on the gameboard crosses itself twice. There is a traffic light at one intersection that regulates movement as players approach it. The traffic light changes when a player lands on one of four &ldquo;red dot&rdquo; spaces. This allows players approaching from the other direction to advance while stopping traffic from the first direction.<br/><br/>The first player to accumulate seven red stars and purchase the Cadillac Fleetwood Brougham for $10,500 is the winner.<br/><br/>",

(Tarkenton was a New York Giant quarterback at the time &ndash; before he led the Vikings to three Super Bowls.)<br/><br/>The game was advanced for the time, and very much a simulation. The game used 23 offensive basic plays and 8 defensive lines. Unlike some contemporaries and many lesser football games, the proper defense will limit the damage of a great roll. Despite the limited number of offensive plays, there are plenty of choices since the plays can showcase feature positions. Also, beyond the 8 defensive setups, the defensive player can also have the choice of which player to 'key' on. Of course, double-covering the wrong receiver will allow a lesser roll to have a higher result.<br/><br/>The true advancement for the game system was the yearly 'rating' of each team on their defensive and offensive line in each of these plays. Thus, when you played two teams, there was a die roll modifier for each play based on each defense.<br/><br/>The clock functions were also very good, allowing a true 'two minute drill' and the use of real game strategies.<br/><br/>Fran Tarkenton's Pro Football is a great time capsule with a look at the teams in the 1960s, before they merged to become the NFC and AFC.<br/><br/>",

Each opponent has 1 king, and they share 9 pieces of each of 5 colours.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player moves their king 1 space orthogonally or diagonally and adds 1 coloured block to the board. The first player to surround the opponent's king wins. This basic version is very close to Isolation. Differences: You add pieces instead of taking them away. The board size is larger (8x8 instead of 6x8). There are fewer pieces (45 instead of 46).<br/><br/>The advanced version allows a player to escape if there are two pieces of the same colour adjacent to the king. The game continues until no such escape is possible.<br/><br/>",

The game system will be using our Forged in Fire rules with adjustments for the situation facing both Union and Confederate commanders in the Shenandoah Valley. Supply and surprise will be critical as Jackson races up and down the Valley fighting one Union force after another as the Union try to trap the Confederates. The game will include a main campaign as well as several shorter scenarios. Playable in 3-4 hours for the full campaign with 1-2 hours for scenarios. Victory is determined by how many Union troops the Confederate player can force the Union player to keep in the Valley. The Union player will try to keep the bare minimum of troops in the Valley to prevent the Confederate player from obtaining certain objectives.<br/><br/>According to Worthington's June 1, 2011 update this game will be the first in a series including games on the Vicksburg, Gettysburg, Overland, and Atlanta campaigns as well as an update of Forged in Fire: The 1862 Peninsula Campaign.<br/><br/>",

Additionally the rules state that each player starts with $1,900 (not $1,000) broken out into 16 $100 bills, 4 $50 bills and 20 $5 bills, meaning there should be at least 64 $100 bills, 16 $50 bills and 80 $5 bills in a complete set, maybe more]. Players move around the board contributing money into the Sweepstakes purse. buying horses, and buying sweepstakes tickets.<br/><br/>If a player lands on a square already owned by another player, the player makes a side bet of 5.00 by paying the fee to the owner of the horse. If that horse eventually wins the owner must pay off the bettor at odds shown below the name and price of his horse.<br/><br/>A player must be on the yellow circuit of the board in order to win. If a roll puts his marker past the &quot;winning post&quot; square on his first time around he must go around the circuit once more. As he hears the 'Winning Post&quot; position a 2nd time he must stop if a roll were to take him past the square and then on another turn re-roll and try again to hit the Winning Post square by exact roll. If he does he takes all the money in the Sweeps Fund, pays off all bets on his horse and then wins the game.<br/><br/>",

If the number of players is three, the winner of the previous game or a volunteer receives 12 pieces and the other two players receive 10 pieces each.  Like a Mahjong game, each player arranges his/her pieces into one line with half of the pieces on top of the other half.<br/><br/>Play is very similar to the Western card game 'Hearts', inasmuch as players reveal pieces in turn and whoever has the highest ranking piece being the winner.  Should there be a tie among some players, they apply the same procedures again by revealing more lower pieces until the order is finally determined.<br/><br/>The player who played the strongest combinations of a same type (as what the round-starter played) wins that round.  If there is a tie, the round-starter always wins, or the order of players determines the winner.  For example, if the first and fourth player play the same combinations, first player wins unless fourth player is the round-starter.  The winner of a round collects the won pieces and starts a new round.  The game is played until all pieces are exhausted.  The game will go to the player who wins most pieces.<br/><br/>Other versions of this game are known as Sānb&egrave;i q&iacute; (三倍其: triple game), Dǎ q&iacute; lu&ograve; (打棋摞: playing chess stacks), Chēl&uacute;n q&iacute; zh&agrave;n (車輪棋戰: wheel chess battle) or Jū mǎ pāo (車馬包): chariot-horse-cannon, which is one of the noble three-piece combinations) or Sang Krip.

Scale in one inch = 40 yards for 15mm figures, one figure = 50 men and each turn represents 30-45 minutes.<br/><br/>The basic unit is a regiment or brigade sized unit depending on the national force being represented.  These are then organized into Division which are in turn organized into Wings.  Two or more wings is an army.  During play each unit receives a number of actions called Operations depending on a variety of situation factors.  These are then used to execute movement and other tactical operations.<br/><br/>The rules provide diagrams of historical formations, army lists, and scenarios for the battles of Lutzen (1632), Jankow (1645 -- erroneously listed as 1635 in the contents page) and Anfangsthal (1644).  A separate expansion, called for God, King, Pulk and Orta provides additional optional rules as well as additional army lists for Eastern Europe and the English Civil War.<br/><br/>",

Each person (or partnership) is randomly assigned an occupation: manufacturer, planter, jeweler, broker, inventor, doctor, lawyer or publisher. Each player begins the game with a wad of cash. Each player will move one&rsquo;s own playing piece along the game board&rsquo;s track. Players move along the gameboard according to a pair special dice, which, together, yield a random number from, zero to six. Along the way, each player must buy all six sections of an assigned possession as a victory condition.<br/><br/>The gameboard is divided into six sections. No player may advance to the next section until all the players have completed the previous section:<br/>Paths of Fortune - Each player moves along a separate path using only one die.  Players may pay and collect money from each other. Each player has a guide card, which says what to pay or collect and from whom as one advances along the path.<br/>The Trading Area - Four trains, four planes, four ships and four buses are placed on random Purchase spaces in this area. Here players can buy transportation for use in the next section for price determined by a spinner or barter with other players.<br/>Transportation Department - If a player owns the method of transportation on the space landed there is no penalty. If the player does not own the method of the transportation landed on that player must pay all the players who possess that vehicle. The penalty escalates with the number of vehicles of the designated type owned.<br/>The Jamboree - Whenever two or more players land on the same space, all the players on that space spin the spinner and the player who gets the lowest number pays the penalty the space assigns.<br/>&lsquo;Round and &lsquo;Round Circle - If a player has yet to own all six parts on the assigned possession, the player must buy the remaining parts at double the price spun on the spinner. Advancing in this section means paying other players because of their occupation or because one lacks the transportation mode the space asks for. Players continue in this section until rolling doubles.<br/>The Pay Off - Players sell their possessions back to the bank for whatever space on which they land.<br/><br/>When all the players have reached the end of The Pay Off section, each type of vehicle is sold back to the bank for values as determined by the spinner. Bank loans are paid back at 50% interest. The player with the most money wins.<br/><br/>",

Should you seek the enemy fleet before he strikes?  Should you push ahead with plans to land marines and take the strategic Pacific islands?  Or should you take the war to the enemy and attempt to sneak in a lightning strike on his now undefended home ports?<br/><br/>These are questions you need to answer as your battlegroup streams out to engage the enemy.  Visibility is only limited to the immediate area around your bases and ships.  You will need to send out spotter planes or submarines to screen your fleet as you race to the be first to find and engage the enemy before he finds you.

Included in this report, would be your choices for Group Unit Mix, Flag Carrier to bear you into battle, and suitable Battle group deployments for each one of your battle groups.  A good commander knows that this initial planning may hold the key to victory and will ensure that a comprehensive strategy and matching Battle group deployments are well set out into a workable plan on paper, well before any ship even begins to leave the harbor.<br/><br/>Having done the initial planning, you are now ready to set sail with your battle groups and put your strategic battle plan into action.  Moving your fleets out into the open ocean, you plot the moves of your Fleet Deployments onto your War Chart, watching as events unfold.  These first few moves will be crucial in determining the overall battle positions of your fleets as you head towards enemy waters.  Do you move your fleets in a broad front, or concentrate them into a narrow wedge, aimed straight for the enemy&rsquo;s heart?  How would the enemy be deployed?  What is his plan?  These are questions you must ask yourself as Admiral.  Decide well, and surprise is on your side.  Decide poorly, and risk losing the initiative to a craftier enemy.<br/><br/>With your fleets in position, you now steam steadily towards the enemy.  The War Chart now shows the radial tracks from your scouts.  But where is the enemy?  As the gap between friend and foe narrow, a race develops to see who will be the first to spot the other.  Will luck be on your side, or will you fail to send out your scouts in a well-planned search pattern and allow enemy bombers to slip through to your vulnerable Carriers?  These are questions only you can answer as you sit and wait for the search reports to trickle in.<br/><br/>Suddenly, the enemy is upon you and your picket ships are hit.  As you stare out onto the flight deck from your bridge, what do you do?  Do you circle your wagons and search frantically for the enemy, throwing fighter wings into the air in the hope of slugging it out with the enemy bombers which are sure to follow, or try and scatter your ships to disappear back into the vast empty ocean to regroup?<br/><br/>Should you launch bombers from afar, for that long-range strike into the enemy rear, or go in close for a classic surface naval engagement with your Battleship, Cruisers and Destroyers?<br/><br/>Game Objectives<br/><br/>A win is achieved with any one of the following objectives fulfilled;<br/><br/>1.) Destroy all ground defenders and occupy both Midway Atoll and Wake Island with your Marines<br/><br/>2.) Destroy all ground defenders and occupy all three enemy home ports with your Marines<br/><br/>3.) Sink the enemy Flagship (Carrier or Battleship)<br/><br/>The game ends in a draw if no more Troop transports are still afloat from either team or when the loss of too many units on both sides make it impossible to complete the stated objectives.<br/><br/>",

There are also closely related variants where the goal can be to enclose an opponent's group, or form loops.<br/><br/>The game is named after the abstract patterns that emerge during play, which are reminiscent of the weird tribal artwork of Reg Mombassa.<br/><br/>Official Mambo page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.cameronius.com/games/mambo/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.cameronius.com/games/mambo/</a><br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Gamerz (turn-based, play by email or play by web)<br/><br/><br/>",

The game is designed for two players, but can easily accommodate additional players. For example, each side might have separate naval and ground commanders and/or multiple ground commanders. The Russian player controls the Russian ground and naval forces. The Japanese player controls the Japanese ground and naval forces. The Russian player must defend Russian possessions in Manchuria while building up his armies by reinforcement from Siberia and European Russia, and then inflict unacceptable losses on his opponent and force him to sue for peace. The Japanese player must quickly defeat the Russian army before it can reinforce itself. Both sides must avoid heavy losses and a protracted war. Russian National Will and social unrest may bring on the downfall of the monarchy, while Japan has very limited resources (human, military and financial).<br/><br/>Scope:<br/>Units - Division with some Regiments<br/>Scale - 1 hex = 11 miles<br/>Time - 1 Turn = 1 week<br/><br/>Game is packed in a ziplock bag and contains:<br/>    * 1,100 double-sided 5/8&quot; counters<br/>    * One 22 x 34 Map<br/>    * 24 page rules book<br/>    * Unit/Terrain Identification Chart<br/>    * Ground Game Chart/Terrain Effects Chart<br/>    * Naval Game Charts (2)<br/>    * Off-Map Movement Charts (3)<br/>    * Russian Game Chart<br/>    * Japanese Game Chart<br/>    * Naval Battle Board<br/>    * National Will/Morale Chart<br/>    * Master Sequence chart<br/><br/>",

Movement happens based on the roll of a large wooden die, the instructions written on several special squares, or by playing cards out of the players hand.  The cards can only be used once.<br/><br/>When the first player reaches home, they count the numbers on the unused cards in their 2-10 pile.  The other players are allowed one more turn to get home.<br/><br/>They may try to continue if unsuccessful, but every turn costs them one point from the cards they hold.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who gets home with the most points.<br/><br/>",

One more element was needed  to finish the project, and that&rsquo;s Actions! These rules cover conflicts involving at most 2500 men, at the least about 300. All types of low-level fighting are covered; minor battles, ambushes, raids, prison-breaks, cattle rustling and the storming of forts!<br/><br/>The basic unit of the game is the squadron, which is composed of somewhere between 25-50 men. These are often the size of weak companies, but we use the term company to cover the next administrative level, composed of several squadrons, somewhere between 150-250 men. Each company has a Captain, who has great influence on his men. The overall commander of a side is called a Colonel.<br/><br/>We&rsquo;ve tried to portray just about every troop type in Europe in these rules, from Irish Kern to Spanish Musketeers. One of our favorite elements of this game is its expandability and &quot;accessable chrome&quot;. Anyone can add their favorite forgotten troop type, from Cimaroon to Lap scouts riding Reindeer!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The basic unit is the battalion, usually comprised of three stands of infantry or three vehicles. The basic command formation would be (depending on nation/year) a Brigade or Division. Each Brigade/Division has an attached commander, and each side has a CinC stand. Commanders have Leadership ratings which influence initiative and the pace of the game. The overall rating of a formation determines which Decision Die (Activation) it uses, which determines how many units may act, how many auto-rallies you get, etc.<br/>Units are rated by morale, which is the key element of the game. A unit's morale determines which attack die you use, which morale die you use, and how many times it can recover from panicking.<br/><br/>Fire Combat: The attacker must make an opposed die roll to hit and damage its target. The attacker rolls a die based upon its morale grade, so a Militia unit roles a d6 while an Elite unit roles a d12 to hit. The defender rolls a Cover Die based upon covering terrain; open (d4), light cover (d6), type of tank (light, Med. Heavy) etc. The difference determines how many disorder markers the target takes, and can force a Panic Check.<br/><br/>Attached companies provide fire support, and special units are important in the game. A unit can have up to four attached companies that provide Fire Die bonuses, help recover Disorder markers, etc. Example, a Battalion with an attached HMG company (+2), Mortar Company (+1), AA Company and Medical Company would get a +3 on its Fire Die, force attacking aircraft to make a Morale Check to press a ground attack, and automatically remove one Disorder Marker per turn.<br/><br/>The rules are fairly comprehensive and cover all the basics of the period -- air superiority over the battlefield, ground attack, artillery, smoke, amphibious landings, fortifications, mines, engineers, supply, paratroopers, gliders, etc.<br/><br/>Also included is a set of rules on generating battles and battlefield terrain, basic army lists, equipment lists, and some sample battles and campaigns.<br/><br/>(from the publisher's web site)<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Panzer Korps: Campaigns – Rules & Scenarios<br/><br/><br/>",
