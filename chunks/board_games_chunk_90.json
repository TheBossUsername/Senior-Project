        "description": "The Crimean Campaign, 1941 -42 (TCC) is a strategic level two-player wargame (with strong operational undertones) of low-intermediate complexity covering the fighting across the peninsula that climaxed with the German capture of Sevastopol.<br/><br/>The action simulated in the game took place historically between 28 October 1941 and 4 July 1942. The first date marks the German entry into the Crimea via the Perekop Isthmus, while the second marks the end of organized Soviet resistance across the whole peninsula. Those nine calendar months are divided into chronologically varied and unequal numbers of turns. That approach allows for the convenient simulation of the ebbs and flows in the action that took place due to bad weather and logistical and command-control constraints.<br/><br/>The Perekop Isthmus fight, which took place from 24 September through 27 October, just off-map to the north, is not included in the game because it took place across terrain too restrictive to allow for maneuver by either side. At this scale it would have come down to how lucky the German player got in rolling his inescapably low-range and mid-range initial frontal attacks. So that episode is considered to have taken place as the last act of the Dniepr River campaign rather than the first act in the Crimean campaign.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Seal Of Pragon is a traditional-style solitaire card game that only requires a single deck of standard playing cards (with two Jokers). The layout for this game looks roughly like a five-pointed star. The goal of this game is to remove all cards from the table by creating poker hands.<br/><br/>A clever array of action bonuses are afforded the player for every poker hand achieved. Examples include everything from removing cards to accessing the discard pile (helping to prolong the game).<br/><br/>The title for this game comes from its loose backstory. As stated by the designer &quot;It roughly involves the player being part of an ancient order trying to break a seal which will unleash an ancient evil if it is not broken before dawn.&quot;<br/><br/>The Seal Of Pragon was a 2013 Print &amp; Play Contest entry.<br/><br/>",

In the first round, 1 player is selected - &quot;Card Bro&quot; of this round. &quot;Card bro&quot; takes 1 black card from the deck (black cards lie in one deck with the inscription down) and read out the text loudly. Each of the participants (except for &quot;Card bro&quot;) chooses one of his white cards that seems to him the most suitable.<br/><br/>White cards are transferred to Card Bro, which in turn reads each option separately. We recommend that you reread the black card completely before reading out a new white card. &quot;Card bro&quot; is chosen by the winner, in his opinion, the option. The player whose white card wins this round receives a black card as a &ldquo;ball.&quot;<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each player draws a new white card from the deck, so that at the beginning of the next round everyone has 10 white cards. White cards used in this round can be put down the white deck so that after a while they will return to them again. In each subsequent round, a new Card Bro is selected so that each player receives this role in turn. You yourself can choose the principle of changing &ldquo;bro&rdquo;: clockwise / counterclockwise, by height, age, leg size, or another sign that is understandable to all participants.<br/><br/>There are black cards in the deck, labeled &ldquo;take 2&rdquo;. In this case, each player must choose 2 white cards to form a winning combination. It is important to read the white cards in the correct order. Therefore, the card, the text of which you want to read first, you always need to put under the second card and so transmit &quot;bro.&quot;<br/><br/>If you wish, you can modify the rules, for example, play without a &ldquo;Card Bro&rdquo;.

Each player bids the number of Tricks he thinks he will win this Hand. Each player in turn then lays down a single card into each Trick.  The player who played the highest ranking card of the led suit (or the Trump suit) wins the Trick and takes the cards.  After each Hand, points are given for Tricks won, with bonus points given for correctly predicting the number of Tricks won.  The game ends after the maximum Hand size is reached, and the player with the highest score wins the game!<br/><br/>________________________________________________<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsTrick = The cards on the table after each player has played a card.<br/><br/>Trump = The trump suit card determines which suit Trump is.  Trump cards win Tricks over cards of other suits.<br/><br/>Follow Suit = Players must, if able, play a card that has the same suit as the first played card of the Trick.<br/>________________________________________________<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tRules of Play1) Setup <br/>A player is chosen as scorekeeper and writes the names of the players on the score sheet.  He then shuffles the cards and deals 1 to each player, this is the first Hand.  After each Hand, the player on the dealer's left becomes the new dealer.  The stack of undealt cards are placed face down on the table, and the top card is flipped over and placed next to the pile.  This is the Trump suit card, it determines the starting Trump suit for the current Hand.  If a joker is turned over, continue turning over cards until a suited card is revealed.  (In the extremely rare event all the undealt cards are jokers, hearts is the starting Trump suit.)<br/><br/>2) The Hands  <br/>In the first Hand, each player is dealt 1 card, giving 1 Trick available to win the first Hand.  When a Hand is over, the cards are reshuffled and dealt, with each subsequent Hand increasing by 1 card.  So, in the second Hand, each player is dealt 2 cards, giving 2 Tricks available.  In the third Hand, each player is dealt 3 cards, giving 3 Tricks available.  The maximum number of cards that can be dealt evenly to the players (while leaving at least 4 undealt for the Trump suit pile) will be the final Hand.<br/><br/>For example: With 9 players, the final Hand will have 10 cards apiece.  There will also be 8 cards undealt, in a face down pile, to determine Trump.<br/><br/>3) Bidding<br/>After the players have sorted their cards by suit and rank, each player considers how many Tricks he will win this Hand.  Beginning with the player to the left of the dealer and continuing clockwise, each player states their bid prediction for the Hand.  The scorekeeper notes the bids on the score sheet.<br/><br/>4) The Tricks<br/>The player to the left of the dealer plays the first card in a Hand.  Play continues clockwise, everyone playing a single card into the center of the table.  If the led card has a suit, everyone must Follow Suit, if they can.  If the first card (or cards) played is a joker, the first suited card played sets the suit and all remaining players must Follow Suit.<br/>If a player does not have a card of the suit led, he may play anything he likes, including a Trump card, or a joker.<br/><br/>5) Jokers<br/>When jokers are played, they modify the trump suit.  Jokers cannot win a Trick, unless there is nothing but jokers in the Trick; in that case, the first played joker wins the Trick.  There are two types of jokers&mdash;four with 2 dots and four with 4 dots.<br/><br/>When a joker with 2 dots is played, the trump suit changes immediately.  Flip over the top undealt card until a different suit is revealed; this is the new trump suit.  (In the unlikely event that there is not a different suit in the undealt card pile, or if the whole pile is flipped over, the trump suit changes to the next lower suit, ranked mushrooms, hearts, diamonds, clovers, crosses, horns.)  This trump suit remains until the end of the Hand, or another joker is played.<br/><br/>When a joker with 4 dots is played, there is no trump suit immediately.  Flip over the trump suit card so they are all facedown.  Only the lead suit can win a trick.  There will be no trump suit until the end of the Hand, or a 2-dot joker is played.<br/><br/>6) Winning the Trick<br/>The player who played the highest card in the suit which led the Trick, will win the Trick, unless a card in the Trump suit is played.  If a Trump card is played, it will win the trick.  If several Trump cards are in the Trick, the highest ranking Trump card wins the Trick.<br/><br/>Each Trick won by a player should be placed in separate piles, so it is always known how many Tricks each player has won to this point.<br/><br/>The winner of a Trick opens the next Trick by playing a new card from their Hand.  When each player has no more cards in their Hand, the Hand is over and points are scored.<br/><br/>7) Scoring <br/>After a Hand is over, each player receives 1 point for each trick they won.  They also receive 10 points if they correctly predicted the number of tricks they won, unless they bid 0.  If they bid and won 0 tricks, they only receive 5 points.  The total number of points is recorded on the score sheet.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGame EndThe game ends after the largest Hand possible for that many players, leaving at least 4 cards undealt for the Trump suit pile.  So, for 10 players, there will be 9 Hands&mdash;with the final Hand having 9 cards.  9 players, 10 Hands.  8 players, 11 Hands.  7 players, 13 Hands.  6 players, 15 Hands.  5 players, 18 Hands.  4 players, 23 Hands.  3 players, 32 Hands.  (With smaller number of players, you may want to use the Skip Up variant below.)<br/><br/>After the final Hand is played and scored, the scores for all 10 Hands are added up.  The player with the highest score is the winner!<br/><br/>If there is a tie, the player who scored the most points the final Hand wins.  Still tied?  Flip a coin for the winner!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariantsSkip Up: For a shorter game, add 2 cards to each Hand.  So, the first Hand will have 1 card, but the second will have 3 cards, the third Hand will have 5 cards, and so on.  This is especially useful when playing with 5 or fewer players.<br/><br/>Hose the Dealer: The total number of bids may not equal the total number of Tricks available.  For example, in the fifth Hand, with 5 Tricks available, the total number of bids by all players may not equal 5.<br/><br/>Hidden Bid: Every player records their bid on a piece of paper.  When everyone has finished bidding, bids are announced and recorded by the scorekeeper.  This keeps the bids unaffected by competitor's bids.<br/><br/>Secret Bids: Every player records their bid on a piece of paper.  The bids are only revealed after the last Trick of the Hand is taken.  Therefore, it is unclear during the Hand how many Tricks each player would like to win.<br/><br/>Shooting the Stars: If a player wins all the Tricks in a Hand, he receives 2 points for each Trick taken, instead of only 1.  This includes the first Hand, with only 1 Trick available!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Everyone dreams of holidays by the sea.&nbsp;On the beach are beach houses, picnic baskets, colourful screens &amp; parasols.&nbsp;Laughter is heard from the beach houses, while seagulls swoop &amp; dive over the heads of sunbathers, watching for easy pickings from unwatched picnic baskets.&nbsp;<br/><br/>Mewy (Seagulls) is a fast-paced card game for two players where you create an individual tableau by creating a beach, building beach huts &amp; keeping seagulls at bay by lobbing pebbles towards them or sending them onto your opponent&rsquo;s beach. Your goal is to score as many points as possible by creating co-ordinated rows of beach huts. You can score extra points from items found under pebble tokens.&nbsp;Seagulls score you negative points.<br/><br/>Players draw 3 cards each, keep one, give one to their opponent (face down) &amp; discard one (face down). After drafting, each player has 2 cards to place in their beach tableau (following the placement rules).<br/><br/>Your beach tableau has 3 rows: beach huts (top), beach (middle), seagulls (bottom). No row can be over 10 cards long. Beach hut cards must be played above a beach card &amp; seagulls placed below a beach card, so you have to collect beach cards before you can build up your tableau. Beach cards are just sand or depict pebbles. When you play a pebble beach card you can pick up pebble tokens (which you keep face down, so you don&rsquo;t know the scoring symbols underneath). Pebble tokens score you VPs at game end.<br/><br/>Beach huts (numbered 1-15) are placed in ascending order &amp; score VPs when in sets of 3 different colours or sets of the same colour. Mewy (Seagull) cards are worth negative points at the end of the game, so trying to get rid of them by scaring them off using pebbles is wise but it&rsquo;s a balance as some pebbles are worth more VPs than others at game end.<br/><br/>The game &amp; rules are in Polish but cards are language independent.<br/><br/>",

The price per unit of fuel varies from port to port. Getting out of fuel implies either paying other ships to be towed or slowly drifting away, until a bunkerage port has been reached.<br/><br/>If a ship moves in a bad weather zone, for each move the player draws a card that can inflict damages to the ship; upon reaching a total of six damages the ship is forced to reach the nearest port for repairing.<br/><br/>Fuel units and damages are recorded by turning the numbered wheels on the cardboard representing the player ship.<br/><br/>Available cargoes to collect and deliver are drawn randomly from a deck at the start of the game and later on during the play each time a player draws a card to check for damage. Each time a cargo has been delivered, it is immediately put back into the deck, and the deck is reshuffled.<br/> The first player to collect the agreed amount of cash wins the game and is given the title of &quot;Master&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The simple elegance and constant player interaction of the WWII Commander games capture the tension of WWII strategy. The game system is a fast-playing introduction to war games, but mastering its tactics is a true challenge as the players take turns deciding which units to activate and where to attack and defend.<br/><br/>Market-Garden recreates the Allied airborne and ground offensive against the German Army in Holland in September 1944. Allied airborne divisions dropped behind German lines to hold a highway corridor across rivers and canals until ground forces could link up to cross into the industrial heart of Germany. Each player commands the opposing Allied or German forces.<br/><br/>The simple elegance and constant player interaction of the WWII Commander games capture the tension of WWII strategy. The game system is a fast-playing introduction to war games, but mastering its tactics is a true challenge as the players take turns deciding which units to activate and where to attack and defend.<br/><br/>As the Allied player, your airborne forces must seize and hold key objectives while your armored ground forces break though the German front and advance aggressively without getting cut off by German infantry and armor coming from all sides. As the German player, you must delay the Allied ground advance, trading space for time as you attempt to destroy the airborne forces behind your lines. The rules are simple, gameplay is fast and furious, and can be completed in one sitting, and either side can win at different stages of the game.<br/><br/>Game features specific to Market-Garden include: Airborne landings, variable weather, concentric attacks, German off-map movement, effects of polder terrain, river assaults, ferry movement.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 out of 10 (Low)<br/>    Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10 (no hidden units)<br/>    Time scale: Half day per game-turn<br/>    Map scale: 5 km across per space<br/>    Unit scale: Regiments and brigades<br/>    Players: Two (also suitable for solitaire play)<br/>    Playing Time: 2 to 4 hours<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Free print-and-play.<br/><br/>Russian doomsday super submarine Belgorod - it's even a mothership for little subs, although that's not in the game - is trying to get on the loose to threaten one of our coasts.  Can you detect and shadow it for 4 of the 12 turns to win?<br/><br/>Or can it stay UNdetected for 3 turns, then ending up near one of our coasts to win?<br/><br/>She starts in the Arctic Ocean, and our US Navy and allied Anti-Sub Task Groups ... and a couple missioned attack submarines (Illinois and Minnesota) ... must find and ride her.<br/>VERY good solitaire game as the Allied player. Just use the 2-side Russian pieces upside-down, randomly mix them up, and move each logically.<br/><br/>With 1 or more combinations of coin tosses or 50% die rolls, the Allied player's naval units attempt to detect her and then if successful shadow her from on or beneath the sea area she is in, with improved odds of continuing to do so.<br/>3 continuous turns of successfully shadowing her wins a quick/sudden-death victory.  However, if she can remain (or again become) unshadowed - whether or not she is detected by satellite - for 3 turns, the last one being in a U.S. coastal sea area, the Russian player instead wins the game.<br/><br/>12 playing pieces - only 1 more than SPI's Strike Force One's 11! - Belgorod and 3 Decoys and 4 Allied ASTGs and 2 SSNs and *their* decoys.<br/><br/>And I can attest that she and her Decoys can bedevil a solitaire Allied player at least as much as a second, Russian player could.<br/><br/>Applicable quotes from the film (and presumably the book) The Hunt for Red October of (Sean Connery's) Marko Ramius:<br/><br/>&quot;Once more, we play our dangerous game, a game of chess against our old adversary - The American Navy. For forty years, your fathers before you and your older brothers played this game and played it well. But today the game is different. We have the advantage.<br/><br/>We will pass through the American patrols, past their sonar nets, and lay off their largest city, and listen to their rock'n'roll while we conduct miss-ile drills. Then, and when we are finished, the only sound they will hear is our laughter, while we sail to Havana, where the sun is warm, and so is the comradeship. A great day, comrades! We sail into history!&quot;<br/><br/>And later:<br/><br/>&quot;... years I have been at sea. A war at sea. A war with no battles. No monuments. Only casualties.&quot;<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

But with tanks and missiles in both hands.<br/>The focus of the fighting was in Central Europe, the economic and cultural center. Two hundred thousand Red Army soldiers, who were supposed to be reduced in number, crossed the East-West German border one after another, supplementing and defeating NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) forces that were moving in surprise attacks at various points. Hamburg and Haber fell on the second day of the faith, and Bremen on the third day. On the North German Plain, the traditional West German armored divisions also faced the oncoming Red Storm, but they had a hard time.<br/>The fighting within West Germany was coming to an end. A Red Army tank division surrounded the Ruhr industrial area. The garrison resisted stubbornly, but its destruction was only a matter of time.<br/>Around that time, the U.S. contingent, finally on European soil, began its advance.

Seep is more over popular in Indian, Pakistan and few other Asian countries.<br/><br/>The aim of the Seep game is to capture cards worth points from a layout on the table (also known as the floor). The game ends when one team has accumulated a lead of at least 100 points over the other team (this is called a baazi). Players can decide in advance how many games (baazis) they want to play.<br/><br/>At the end of the seep round the scoring value of the captured cards is counted: (1) All cards of the Spade suit have point values corresponding to their capture value (from the king, worth 13, down to the ace, worth 1), (2) The aces of the other three suits are also worth 1 point each, and (3) The ten of diamonds is worth 6 points.<br/><br/>Players can also score for a seep, which occurs when a player captures all the cards from the layout, leaving the table empty. Normally a seep is worth 50 points, but a seep made on the very first play is worth only 25 points, and a seep made on the last play is worth no points at all.<br/><br/>",

The rules are for solo or co-op play where the players command the U-boats and the game handles the convoy of allied merchants ships.<br/><br/>Players will roll command dice against their submarine's crew skill in order to take actions.  Failed actions will allow the convoy to move for each fail.  The U-boats will be in a race to sink or damage as many ships as possible before the convoy makes it safely off the board.  It takes skill and luck to maneuver and line up your shots.<br/><br/>The game can also add hazards to the U-boats in the form of escorts and aircraft that will attempt to sink them by bombing, ramming or depth charges if they are detected during play.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by the number of ships sunk, if any, before the convoy exits the board.  Submarine players loose if they do poorly or are sunk during the contact.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Then the board is turned over and the player who played with the smugglers now plays with the tax guard and the four dogs.<br/>After the second game, the smugglers who crossed the border are counted again.<br/>The player who manages to get the most smugglers across the border after two games is the winner.<br/><br/>",

After you give them your lunch and pet them you decide to take them to the school with you. But it turns out it was not the best idea because Hupszi is not very good at obeying rules and also it is strictly forbidden to bring pets to the school. You face a feally difficult challenge to keep Hupszi hidden from the teachers. Can you work together in perfect harmony to deal with the mischieves of Hupszi and save yourselves from going to the head teachers office?<br/>This is a cooperative two player game. You each start with all your cards in your hands. There are two main type of cards:  on watch, and snooze. You place the 3 teacher cards in the middle of the table. At the beginning of each round you flip the top Hupszi card and see what he is up to and where. Each teacher has their own territory, you see the symbols in the corner of the cards. The same symbols appear on the Hupszi cards so you see which teacher will be angry if Hupszi gets discovered. After you flipped the Hupszi card you each choose a card from your hand secretly then reveal it at the same time. If at least one of you played an on watch card you can put back the Hupszi card at the bottom of the deck. Buti f both of you were snoozing then Hupszi gets discovered and you place it by the teacher whose territory he was making a mess at. If a teacher catches you the 5th time you loose the game. If you manage to play all your cards twice in 2 rounds without being sent to the head teacher you are truly best friends whose minds are set on the same wavelenght.<br/><br/>",

They can launch satellites, swap them with one another to move them around the looped chain, and use their special effects to outsmart the opponent or destroy their satellites and break their chain. The competition is real, so do whatever it takes to make your chain the longest!<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players get 1 Victory Point for each connected satellite in their chain.

Your offensive and defensive skills are constantly challenged and changing throughout this fast-paced game, that involves a combination of skill, strategy and luck.<br/><br/>Teams compete to be the first to score 11 points by collecting sets and runs of cards to get a complete hand. You can only score when you have control of the serve though so be sure to stop your opponent from getting on a service run.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An evil scientist has captured 15 different dinosaurs and is holding them in a &quot;paddock&quot; fenced area for his studies. The players are trying to rescue and free the dinosaurs. The game background story says this occurs on a large island near the US. There is no further reference to a well known movie with a somewhat similar dinosaur park theme.<br/><br/>Each person, in turn, plays card(s) to free the dinos from the paddock; or can play cards to take a dino from another player; or can build up their hand of cards to use on a future turn. Players also interact by trying to play the highest value card when a dino card is played which is marked with a less than symbol at the top. (Somewhat the reverse of actual game play which is to place a greater number than the other players.)<br/><br/>The game can be played using either one of two ending victory conditions: A) be the first player to release 5 dinos, or B) have freed the most dinosaurs when the game ends... after the last dino is freed from the &quot;paddock&quot; area.<br/><br/>The publisher especially intends for this to be an educational game for kids to learn more about these dinos, and to use some basic math.<br/><br/>",

Lay any number of cards from your hand facedown in front of another player and name a character. The other player either accepts your statement or calls your bluff. If they were wrong, attention is directed towards them, so they place the cards in front of them. If they were correct, attention is drawn back to you instead, and you take the cards. The other player may also choose to pass on the cards to a third player instead, but they must first turn one of them faceup, keeping it beside them; if it matches any cards they've previously flipped from passing on prior turns, they must place all those cards in front of them. Gain too many cards of any one character and you die, losing the game while everyone else wins. However, if all players happen to survive by the time the deck runs out, the player who gained the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to score the appropriate number of points for controlling the targets marked on the board. During the game, players move cards representing specific units on a grid of fields, clashing with the enemy army in a dynamic skirmish. The faction decks available in the game represent various civilizations known from the rich mythologies of polytheistic cults. Players will have to manage their units by performing a variety of actions that allow them to maneuver around the battlefield and harass the enemy.

        "description": "They say faith works miracles, but that's not true. The gods work miracles, and faith strengthens their power. However, when the ancient peoples die out, and the gods are worshiped by a smaller and smaller group of worshipers, their power decreases. So they set off - one by one - in search of new acolytes, and their eyes turn to the shores of Lumeria...<br/><br/>Lumeria is a battle card game, and Slavs vs Vikings is one of the core sets for the game.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of gods known from various mythologies and lead their armies while competing with the enemy on the battlefield. The aim of the game is to score the appropriate number of points for controlling the targets marked on the board. During the game, players move cards representing specific units on a grid of fields, clashing with the enemy army in a dynamic skirmish. The faction decks available in the game represent various civilizations known from the rich mythologies of polytheistic cults. Players will have to manage their units by performing a variety of actions that allow them to maneuver around the battlefield and harass the enemy. The constant economy system not only ensures a balanced gameplay, but also allows you to fix some decisions, making the gameplay more engaging. A wide range of special abilities of units and powerful gods create an amazing combination, allowing you to make bold plays on the battlefield and win glory for your faction!<br/><br/>",

Each player has seven containers and two barrels, one normal and one &quot;explosive/radioactive&quot; (twice as heavy), and a spinner determines what needs to be loaded on each player's turn. Containers must be loaded by a loading fork and must always touch previously placed containers from the same player, while barrels can be more freely placed by hand to either balance the ship or to make it trickier for the next player to load their cargo. Matters are further complicated by a pesky pelican who thinks that &quot;Le Barjo&quot; is simply the best perching point in the whole harbour, and always insist on sitting at the highest point of the boat.<br/><br/>Tipping cargo overboard is bad as you get all of your own tipped cargo back, while any other players' pieces are out of the game, making it easier for them; the first one to get rid of all their cargo wins.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/><br/>     Riff Raff<br/><br/><br/>",

The pieces resemble konpeitō, brightly colored Japanese sugar candy.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they may choose to collect a Copet, consume a Copet by placing it on their Tummy Tracker, or draw an Astrology Card. After they've consumed certain amounts of Copets, they may also switch a Copet with another player or place one of their Copets on anoter player's Tummy Tracker. Collecting a white Copet allows a player to draw and reveal a special White Astrology Card.<br/><br/>When the box is emptied of Copets, players reveal their cards and score points according to the Copets and Astrology Cards they've collected. For instance a player might score 2 points if they have 2 red Copets on their Tummy Tracker, or they might score 5 points because the player to their right consumed 2 blue Copets.<br/><br/>",

That peaceful period of time, now known as the Age of Light, is barely a distant memory to the now warring nations. No one knows exactly where the line was drawn between these former allies, but the carnage that followed is now etched in stone, and continues to this day.<br/><br/>In Galactic Tactics players take on the role of two warring alien races. Players move around the game board using four unique ship types that the players drafted at the beginning of the game. Each ship offers a tactical movement sequence that can eventually score victory points by landing on one of three enemy planets, thus earning victory points. Ships can also be captured during battle, which can lead to a military victory by elimination/stalemate. Players will continue to move their pieces around the board in an effort to win the game by scoring enough victory points, or by forcing a stalemate.<br/><br/>",

There are no open questions and the game rounds are entertaining and exciting.

Fun guaranteed!<br/><br/>Through the 4 different editions, a huge variety is offered. In addition to the family-friendly Classic Edition, the child-friendly Junior Edition and the naughty Red Light Edition bring a certain variety to the game night!<br/><br/>Spielablauf:<br/>So wird gespielt: Jeder Spieler bekommt per Zufallsprinzip 8 Buchstaben-Karten ausgeh&auml;ndigt. Nun muss jeder Spieler m&ouml;glichst schnell einen Begriff passend zu einer seiner Buchstaben-Karten ablegen. Wichtig: Es z&auml;hlt jeweils der Anfangsbuchstabe des Wortes und man muss NICHT aus den Buchstaben-Karten einen Begriff bilden, wie es in anderen Spielen z.B: Scrabble manchmal der Fall ist.<br/>Es wird also spannend: Die 60 Kategorie-Karten enthalten insgesamt 200 verschiedene und lustige Kategorien:<br/>Wer kann zuerst einen &ldquo;Beruf&rdquo; ablegen? Oder einen &ldquo;Trennungsgrund&rdquo;? Was ist mit einer &ldquo;Stadt im Ausland&rdquo;? F&auml;llt dir zu deinen Buchstaben-Karten schnell ein &ldquo;Ber&uuml;hmter Toter&rdquo; ein bzw. kommt Dir sofort ein &ldquo;bekannter Schauspieler&rdquo; in den Sinn?<br/>Wichtig nun: Der SCHNELLSTE Spieler gewinnt jeweils die Runde und am Ende gewinnt der Spieler das Spiel, der zuerst alle Buchstaben-Karten losgeworden ist. Durch die 10 zus&auml;tzlichen Aktionskarten wird das Spiel besonders spannend.<br/>Nat&uuml;rlich gibt es auch VOLLPFOSTEN-Karten im Spiel die entweder als Joker wirken oder als kniffliger Konter genutzt werden.<br/><br/>How to play: Each player is randomly dealt 8 letter cards. Now each player must place a word matching one of his letter cards as quickly as possible. Important: The first letter of the word counts and you do NOT have to form a term from the letter cards, as is sometimes the case in other games, e.g. Scrabble.<br/><br/>So it gets exciting: The 60 category cards contain a total of 200 different and funny categories:<br/><br/>Who can put down a &quot;profession&quot; first? Or a &quot;reason for separation&quot;? What about a &quot;city abroad&quot;? Can you quickly think of a &quot;Famous Dead Person&quot; or a &quot;Famous Actor&quot; for your letter cards?<br/><br/>Important now: The FASTEST player wins each round and at the end the player who first got rid of all letter cards wins the game. The 10 additional action cards make the game especially exciting.<br/><br/>Of course, there are also FULL FIX cards in the game that either act as jokers or are used as tricky counters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Die WOOZELIGE Sonderedition vom Stadt-Land-Vollpfosten Kartenspiel!<br/><br/>Hochwertige Klappdeckel-Schachtel in coolem Design made by DENKRIESEN.<br/><br/>Das Prinzip ist so einfach wie genial.

Each newcomer contributes to Mars's development to become a part of the colony and the new world. Do you think it's a sci-fi story? Nope, this is a quite real image of the future. And we must be ready for it.<br/><br/>You have to explore the hostile landscape of Mars and find vital resources to build your colony consisting of different modules. The player who did it first wins the game.<br/><br/>Each player's turn consists of two phases. Firstly, a player rolls a die to determine how much oxygen they have for the second phase. In the second phase, the player expends that oxygen on various actions, like moving a unit, exploring resources, extracting resources, attacking a module or another unit, healing a unit or fixing a module, building a module.<br/>If you have too many of the same resources, you can exchange them in the game's reserve using a fixed 4:1 price. You can also trade with other players using the negotiated exchange rate.<br/><br/>The main goal of the game is to build as many modules as you can. And the gameplay looks simple - find the necessary resources and build the module. But don't forget other players can attack your modules! You have to plan your actions thoroughly and watch out for other players. Once you build a module, you receive a one-time bonus for your next actions (or a penalty for your opponents).<br/>The game lasts until some of the players build the required number of modules.<br/><br/>",

One card is played per turn, and you may:<br/><br/>1. Just extend a row/column and draw a new card. The card you play has to fit just one feature of a row or a column. Come up with one if there&rsquo;s none yet!<br/>What could bring a Picasso painting and a classic portrait together? Let's say, a white headdress! Now all the paintings you play in this row or column must contain a person with the white headpiece.<br/><br/>OR<br/><br/>2. Play your card at the intersection and don&rsquo;t draw a new card. The card you play has to fit both features of a row and a column. Think of one or even both of them!<br/><br/>Your aim is to get rid of cards, but you don't draw a new one only if you manage to place a card that matches both row and column features, so you have to be very attentive, come up with challenging features, and think ahead to play all your cards on the table!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players attempt to remember &amp; correctly identify Poulpy's expressions in order to win tokens.<br/><br/>Players start with 4 cards face down in front of them as their &quot;line.&quot; On a player's turn, they must: (1) Draw and secretly look at the top card, (2) Play the card in the discard pile face up OR add it to their line &amp; discard one of the other cards face up, (3) As an option, discard one or more cards if they believe these to be identical to the last card played. If the discard was a mistake, the player/s must take back their card and add a card to their line without looking at it. There are special cards in the game such as the &quot;Switch&quot; &amp; &quot;Peek&quot; cards that players can use to exchange cards between other players and look at one of their cards respectively.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is an updated version of the ancient game of the same name.<br/><br/>Kariuchi is a race game using four 2-sided dice (4D2). &quot;Kari&quot; refers to the two-sided dice and &quot;uchi&quot; refers to casting them. The basic game is a 2-player game, in which both players try to move their 4 pieces along the path according to the dice rolls and try to reach the goal with their pieces as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>The board consists of 30 fixed points arranged in a circle. Each player's four pieces are not on the board initially, but are placed in their waiting area as reserve pieces. Starting from base point 1, the goal is passed after fixed point 30. The goal is not yet reached just by reaching Fixed Point 30.<br/><br/>To move a piece, the player moves one of his or her own pieces along a fixed point from 1 to 30 on the circumference of the circle, as many times as the number of &quot;kari&quot; dice cast from a set of four dice. The player is free to decide which piece to move in each turn. When a piece stops at a fixed point 5, 10, or 15, the player can change the direction of movement in the next turn and move the piece to a fixed point on the opposite side of the circumference as a shortcut. If the piece stops at the center point &quot;A&quot; during the shortcut move, the player can further change the direction of the move and choose to move in the direction of fixed points 20, 25, and 30.<br/><br/>If a piece you have moved stops at the position of a piece you already have on the board, you can stack the pieces. All of your pieces (up to 4 pieces) can be stacked on top of each other. The stacked pieces can be moved as a single piece. You can also separate the pieces and move only the top piece(s). If a piece you have moved rests on an enemy piece already on the board, the enemy piece is removed and returned to the enemy's reserve position. If a piece lands on an enemy stacked piece, all enemy pieces are moved back to the reserve position. The pieces are then separated and become individual pieces.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In this game, no new &quot;Picasso&quot; is sought, because anyone can doodle! You can play against the clock, cleverly each against each other or in the exciting team mode. This game promises super fun, casual doodling fun for the next game night with family and friends. Thanks to the included doodle boards, the SECOND cube and foil pens for up to 8 players, nothing stands in the way of an instant KRITZELSCHLACHT.<br/><br/>Gameplay Mode 1 of 3 - Everyone against everyone.<br/><br/>The first player draws a KRITZEL card from the deck and places it in the card holder for all other players to see, without looking at it himself. The other players now scribble, as fast and as well as they can, all three terms. The first doodler who has drawn all three terms then shouts &quot;STOP&quot;. All doodlers must then stop drawing immediately. The scribble card is now placed face down and the scoring begins. The card drawer first tries to guess the terms of the fastest doodler. Only if three terms are correctly guessed does the fastest scribbler win. For each guessed term the now guessing card drawer gets one point. If a term cannot be guessed by the fastest scribbler, the scribbler does not receive a single point in this round. Now the card drawer guesses clockwise with the doodle boards of the other players. The other players receive one point for each additional term guessed until all terms have been guessed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Das gnadenlose Partyspiel&nbsp;ist das zweite Spiel aus der Partyfieber-Serie von DENKRIESEN und hat 300 Karten mit insgesamt 900 kinderleichten bis kniffligen Begriffen zum Kritzeln an Bord.

The result of three dice determines the shape of the tetromino block and the building and nature in the block.<br/><br/>When you draw a pentomino block, you can invite a visitor to your town. If you make the visitor happy, you get bonus points.<br/><br/>Aim for a high score by placing buildings and natural features and keeping your invited visitors happy.<br/><br/>The 2-players rule is a cooperative mode. Each player creates their own town. The active player can use three out of four dice, while the inactive player can use the remaining die to draw a nature or a star coin. Total score is determined by the sum of each town's score and cooperative bonus points.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

If you match with anyone else, you and that player score one point.<br/><br/>&quot;That's it?&quot;, you ask. You bet! Like we said before, this game is as fun as it is easy to play.

This is done by means of action cards; players start with some in hand and draft a new one each round. Each player also plays a card each round which gives them an action and also permits a certain number of track tiles to be built. Actions can include buying trains and building stations of various types.<br/><br/>The cards to be drafted also determine a random event each round and a location on the boards for that event.<br/><br/>The right to draft first (and possibly choose the event location next round) is auctioned off.<br/><br/>After using their actions and building track players run their trains for revenue.<br/><br/>The game ends when the deck runs out. Players then score for connecting Denver to Salt Lake City and also for eight out of the ten possible victory conditions; each player knows at least one of these, but some are hidden until the end.<br/><br/>While the game was designed for up to five players, there are six boards and the rules do explain how to play with six if you really want to.<br/><br/>",

Lacking any real tools to support myself (other than a hoodie), the following years involved doing everything in my power to hide from further shame or embarrassment.<br/><br/>After forcing myself into out into the world and slowly regaining confidence to take the hoodie off, a curiosity grew to better understand myself and this internal world I seemingly had very little control of.<br/><br/>I stumbled into meditation, soaked up any talk on psychology, explored therapy, art, men's groups, and above all - found friendships with others who shared this desire to look inward and share more openly about not only the good stuff, but also the less than ideal - our fears, pains and insecurities.<br/><br/>Over time I noticed that it was in these open conversations that our relationship grew. Not to mention they helped us feel a bit less alone - like we were in this together. And within the men's groups, we were paving a new way for what had been told to us as men - to do it alone, to stay strong and not show weakness.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, after being forced to hide myself when I was younger, it has been these moments of seeing others and being seen more deeply that have given me a sense of meaning, connection and purpose.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this game is a tool to create those moments - to explore, uncover, and share what makes us who we are.

The play is about the fairy tale characters' difficult journey to the prince's castle. The one who makes the journey full of obstacles and dangers the fastest wins.<br/><br/>Each Player represents one of the six characters. These characters are the Princess, the Prince, the Magician, the Long, the Wide and the Sharp-eyed. Their mission is to get to the prince's castle as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>There are two dice in the game, the first with pictures of the characters, the second a classic numeric 6-dice. Players take turns rolling both dice. The dice with pictures determines which character will progress, the second dice determines by how many square. Thus, it is very common for a player to move another player's piece around the game board.<br/><br/>However, if he is lucky enough to have his own piece appear on the roll, then he advances by double the number of points rolled on the other dice.<br/><br/>On the black squares, players progress according to the dice roll. However, if they land on a red square, they are forced to perform the action associated with that square. These actions may delay them or even return them to squares they have already passed through. However, they can make them move forward faster in certain cases.<br/><br/>It is up to the players' agreement when the game ends. It may be when the first piece reaches the castle. Its owner wins and the other players lose. However, it is possible to end the game after all but one of the pieces have reached the castle. In that case, we know the order of the other players in addition to the winner who got to the castle first.<br/><br/>",

Many years ago, an evil witch stole 5 magic gems from the Queen, only to lose them in the lake&rsquo;s depths as she made her escape. Over time, the witch&rsquo;s magic has seeped into the waters, contaminating them with her evil. Gnomes, long known as the Keepers of the Forest, seek to return the waters to their former glory. To do so, they must enlist the help of the fairies, building mushroom huts for them to live in. In return, the fairies will use their magic to find the gems and save the lake, restoring beauty to the forest once again. Will you be able to eliminate the quagmire and earn the Queen&rsquo;s favor?<br/><br/>The Quagmires of Mysterra is a 1-4 player game of shifting strategies and sinking maps, involving dice, lily pads, and mushrooms! Puzzle your way through an ever-changing swamp as you beat your opponents to attract the most fairies. Only with their magic can you collect the sacred gems and restore the lake to its former beauty, earning favor with the Queen at last.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, they must match their available Wishing Dice with an action card in their hand. Once a card has been used, it is no longer available to play (until all discarded cards are returned to their hand via the Rest action).

        "description": "Super-G 2018 is the third (of four) offering in our Alpine Skiing series. Slalom 2018 and Giant Slalom 2018 are already out there, work will start on Downhill 2018 as soon as Super-G goes off to be published.<br/><br/>All four events are similar but different! Super-G could have been called 'Mini Downhill' but 'super' is a more appealing term than 'mini' so they went with that. The differences (from Slalom and Giant Slalom) are sufficient to require another re-think and re-design of the basic game engine, hopefully reflecting the difference in the events themselves, but that is for you to judge.<br/><br/>Skiers still have three Ratings, but Start is of less importance as the race times are longer, and we have added Technique to the ever-present Control and Speed. In game terms Technique is the skier's inherent ability in the approach to the turns and in the turns themselves. And because this is an in-built ability the Rating for Technique isn't subject to movement up and down during a run although there may be marginal changes for a particular Turn as part of the Performance Roll. But those changes are temporary, for that Turn only.<br/><br/>Because run times are usually between 60 and 90 seconds there is only one run per skier in each event. And to make the simulation as playable as possible a run consists of just six Turns, two each of Top Section, Middle Section and Bottom Section. One run rather than two helps to simulate the lessened predictability of the event and to reinforce that we let each Turn for each skier use the current Control Rating plus either the current Speed Rating or the static Tech Rating. More of that later.<br/><br/>Once again we have supplied Ratings for the top thirty in the World Cup tables for both Men and Ladies, plus twenty All-Time-Greats in both categories. Details of how to generate your own Ratings are included as before as are very similar solo rules using the familiar Mindset concept. Enjoy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "King of Glory: The Card Game consists of a 54 card deck, with each card numbered 1-54. Each card depicts a different scene from the book, KING of GLORY. In the game you are attempting to play cards sequentially and make connections between cards to score points.<br/><br/>On your turn draw 2 cards either from the top of the deck or the  discard area. You may then play either both cards, one of the cards, or none of the cards. Each card you play will score 1 point at the end of the game. So why wouldn't you always play both cards you might ask?<br/><br/>Because the one rule when playing cards is the card must be lower than all your previously played cards, or higher than all of them. It can't be between any of them.<br/><br/>There is one exception. If a card you want to play has a symbol on it that matches a symbol on a card you've already played, you may ignore the one placement rule. Simply place the card in your played cards row so that all your cards remain in ascending order. At the end of the game you get 2 points for each symbol match.<br/><br/>The game is based on the book KING of GLORY. You do not need to be familiar with the book to play the game, but those that are will enjoy identifying the thematic symbol connections between different cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Object of the Game <br/><br/>To collect as many cards as possible by forming GAMIs<br/><br/>Starting the Game<br/><br/>Gami is a game for 2 players, played with one pack of cards, but only Aces and cards from 2 to 8 are included, from three suits only - Clubs, Diamonds, and Hearts. Spades are not included, meaning the game is played with a total of 24 cards.<br/><br/>Initially, each player is dealt nine cards, the remaining six cards are left on the table. All cards are turned face up.<br/><br/>Playing the Game<br/><br/>In each turn, each player exchanges one card from his or her hand, with one of the six cards placed on the table. The valid exchanges are limited - the exchange rules section below describes the valid combinations. A player who is unable to make a valid exchange loses the game.<br/><br/>If the newly picked up card together with any other two cards in the player's hand completes a GAMI (see below), the player can take any one card from his or her opponent's hand, meaning he or she gets one card more, while the opponent gets one card less.<br/><br/>Only the card picked up during an exchange can form a GAMI. An existing combination of cards in the hand does not constitute a GAMI, although the player can use it to make one by exchanging one of the three cards, then picking it up again during the next turn (assuming that the opponent does not pick that card during his or her turn). The card captured from the opponent's hand after a GAMI is formed does not constitute a new GAMI and does not grant an additional capture.<br/><br/>The rule above applies to the initial nine cards as well - even if a player is dealt a valid GAMI combination, he or she is not eligible to capturing any cards.<br/><br/>A player who is reduced to two cards loses the game, as he or she is no longer able to complete a GAMI. Similarly, a player who is unable to make a valid exchange loses the game.<br/><br/>Exchange rules<br/><br/>Any card can be exchanged for an adjacent card of the same suits. Adjacent cards are cards whose value differs by 1, the value of Aces is considered to be 1. Additionally, Eights and Aces can be exchanged. For example, a Three of Hearts can be exchanged for either a Two of Hearts or a Four of Hearts. An Eight of Diamonds can be exchanged for a Seven of Diamonds or an Ace of Diamonds.<br/><br/>In addition to the above option, even-numbered cards can be swapped for a card of suits of a different color and the same value. For example, a Four of Clubs can be swapped for a Four of Diamonds or a Four of Hearts, in addition to Three of Clubs and Five of Clubs from the first rule. A Six of Diamonds can be exchanged for a Six of Clubs, but not a Six of Hearts, as they both have the same color.<br/>GAMI<br/><br/>A GAMI is one of the following combinations (in any order):<br/>Ace + Two + Three of any single suit<br/>Three + Four + Five of any single suit<br/>Five + Six + Seven of any single suit<br/>Seven + Eight + Ace of any single suit<br/>Twos of Hearts + Diamonds + Clubs<br/>Fours of Hearts + Diamonds + Clubs<br/>Sixes of Hearts + Diamonds + Clubs<br/>Eights of Hearts + Diamonds + Clubs<br/><br/>",

They draw on a central map their movement, visiting different players, and recording it on their memo sheet. Most players only play one position, some players aren't available to scouts every round, etc.<br/><br/>Periodically, there are scorings for who has scouted the most professional players, the first one to scout at least one player at each position, etc.<br/><br/>The player with the most points at the end of nine rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

Teams can also score points here - it's just a matter of drawing the right colors and remembering the colors and positions of all the cards. All well and good - if it weren't for that darn &quot;X&quot;! The &quot;X&quot; acts as a game changer and allows opponents to pick off unsecured pairs!

Do you accept?<br/><br/>Devil's Dice is a lightweight dice rolling game for 2-6 player's. A twisted cross between Coup, and Liar's dice. Lie, cheat, and steal from your friends, in order to be the first to summon the devil!<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with two skull tokens and two dice. The dice are hidden behind a cover screen. Each die has 6 unique symbols.<br/>Satan's pool is the board in the center which dice will be added to throughout the game. <br/>When you've assembled all 6 symbols between your hand and the public die in Satan's pool, you declare Satan's set and win!<br/><br/>On your turn, you can take any of the actions listed below, regardless of whether you have the required symbols:<br/><br/>Imp's set: If your all your dice match, with Imp's counting as wilds, you may gain a die from the common pool. Also block Flames steal. <br/>Skull: If you have a Skull, take two skull tokens from the common pool. <br/>Scythe: If you have a Scythe, pay three skull tokens to try and steal a die. <br/>Pentagram: If you have a Pentagram, re-roll the dice in Satan's pool, and if you roll any pentagram you gain up to one. Also block Scythe's steal. <br/>Trident: If you have a Trident, Take three skull tokens from another player, or block someone from using Trident on you.<br/>Flames: If you have a Flame, Steal 1 skull token from another player, and re-roll your current hand.<br/><br/>Any player may challenge your action or block(claiming you are lying about having the requisite symbols). When challenged you must then reveal your dice hand. If you are caught lying, the action or block is cancelled, and the challenger steals a die from you. If you were telling the truth, instead the challenger loses a die and rolls it into Satan's Pool, and play continues after.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players must avoid the outer walls, explosive mines, and even each other.<br/><br/>Players choose from three different racecars that have different characteristics: a car that's easier to turn will have less varied special abilities.<br/><br/>At the start of each turn, the race grid is covered so it can no longer be seen.<br/><br/>Two D6s are then rolled. The numbers rolled indicate possible Speed values. A single die result can be used for its face value, or the two face values can be added together or subtracted. So a roll of 3 and 4 present valid choices of either 3, 4, 7, or 1.<br/><br/>After the roll, players try to be the first to call out a Speed Value and a Direction (Left, Right, or Straight). If the fastest player's Speed Value call was valid, they have won the 'Call', and the player marks on the paper what they called out. The other player will then, at their leisure, choose a different valid Speed Value, as well as a Direction, and marks this on the paper.<br/><br/>Only after both sets of movements are written down is the game grid uncovered, and lines are drawn indicating where the cars have traveled. The player who won the call draws their line first.<br/><br/>A player wins when their opponent explodes. If both racers survive 18 rounds, then the player who traveled further during the Straights wins.<br/><br/>",

(Whether your dreams are fanciful or twisted is none of my concern.)<br/><br/>To start your campaign, you will need 8 blank cards for making your islands (and more blank cards later on) and a standard deck of 52 playing cards (no jokers).<br/><br/>Each island in the game is represented by an arrangement of standard playing cards.  An attack from one of these cards can target any card of the same suit or rank within an enemy island.  (For example, a 7 of diamonds can knock out any 7 or any diamond.)  Islands are eliminated when they cannot attack anything or when all of their cards have been targeted.  YOU are in control of every attack, whether from your island or from an enemy, with the goal of keeping your own self afloat.<br/><br/>If you can last until your island is one of the last two floating, those two islands will grow and gain special abilities, and you will create a new island (making future games more difficult to win)!  Your premature elimination will see your island start to crumble (making future games easier) or possibly collapse entirely (...much easier).<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Fail to have a full roster in the front lines before then and you'll be overrun and defeated.<br/><br/>In this SOLO game, the successive &quot;battles&quot; are pure abstraction where the Dice Defenders come out of each battle in one of four categories: (1) dead; (2) recoverably wounded; (3) untouched &amp; gaining more combat experience; or (4) totally burned out. Battle outcomes are measured using the roll of one RED (wounded) D6 die and one BLACK (killed) D6 die. The numbers rolled go against the Combat Experience values of the Dice Defenders. HOWEVER, once all eligible civilians are pulled into Boot Camp, morale at the colony plummets and the two D6 dice are replaced with D8 ones - potentially increasing the number wounded and killed in future battles!<br/><br/>With each battle engagement, the survivors become more powerful and less likely to fall into categories 1 &amp; 2. Push their luck too far and they'll fall into category 4. The only way to avoid category 4 is to remove them to Rest &amp; Recreation Centers for a time - which means that while they're recovering, you have fewer experienced defenders on the field to take the brunt of future RED &amp; BLACK dice rolls.<br/><br/>As Commander, it's up to you to perform this balancing act of who stays in and who gets time off - at the cost of those under your command! Show too much compassion and you'll lose the war from having too few defenders on the field. Show too little compassion and you'll lose the war from losing too many defenders through their breakdown. Who stays in without recuperating and who has to come back early? All in the name of keeping the front lines fully occupied!<br/><br/>Do you have what it takes to make the right call, following the credo - 'Mission first; Men second'?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Express Zirkhaki, much like the original Zirkhaki, players act as diggers trying to dig for treasure and accumulate as much points as they can. The players first will remove the lowers numbered item from the deck and shuffle them and put them on one side as the &quot;discard pile&quot;, then shuffle the rest of the items and put them on the other side as the &quot;dig pile&quot;. The distance between the dig pile and discard pile is the &quot;dig site&quot;. <br/>Then the first player is chosen, and they will turn over the top card from the dig pile onto the dig site. Each item has a special power that then will be implemented. The player then can either turn over more cards, or end their turn and gather the cards in the dig site as their collection. If they turn over more cards, more powerful items can be found, but also if the same item is drawn again, their turn will end immediately and all of the items in the dig site go to the discard pile, and the player will get none of them.<br/>Then the play moves to the player on the left, and goes on until the dig pile is empty. Then each player will count the highest number item they have and add them up for their final score. The player with the highest score is the winner. <br/>The game is designed for 2 to 4 players, but by combining two sets of item cards the game can be played by 5 to 8 people as well. Although, since the item cards are the same as with the original Zirkhaki, the games can combine the item cards to accommodate more players.<br/><br/>",

As a pyrotechnician, your goal is quite simple: make an impression, and be appointed as a Master Pyrotechnician by the Emperor himself.<br/><br/>Complete the most beautiful fireworks display by creating a calculated succession of explosions. Give the audience a show to be remembered, have them applause, and at the end, impress the Emperor with a memorable grande finale!<br/><br/>In Spring Festival, each player will have to place their fireworks as best as possible to create chain reactions and explode as many rockets as possible.

F&eacute;lix Estigarribia, lacking the resources to beat the Bolivians through pitched battle, developed a bold approach based in wide deep sweeps, aimed at the Bolivian rearguard, isolating his foe so that he either surrendered or died of thirst.<br/><br/>This simulation has its focus on this particular type of warfare.

One player leads with a combination. The other player must follow and play a higher version of the exact same combination.<br/><br/>Teech for Two was inspired by David Parlett's &quot;The Bum Game&quot;, which was Parlett's preferred way of playing Daihinmin.<br/><br/>What makes Teech for Two original and exciting is the way that it introduces wilds that are always dealt to each player every hand. With wilds available like this, many more hands are playable and it's always an exciting puzzle to figure out how to best play out a hand.<br/><br/>",

Do you go defensive and help keep your fellow Explorers alive? Possibly compromising your safety, but meaning there are less Lost Souls (and Inhabitants) hunting you down; do you go offensive? and try to open up paths to eliminate your fellow Explorers or do you actively convert yourself into a Lost Soul and try to activate the secondary win condition, where if no Explorer escapes, the Lost Soul(s) responsible for converting the most Explorers is declared the winner.

On your go, you&rsquo;ll put up one of four lots for auction. Each player uses their letter tiles to make a word. Each tile has a Live side &ndash; with a dollar value &ndash; and a Dead side &ndash; without, and this determines the value of their bid. When you win an auction, any Live letters you used are flipped to their Dead side but remain in your available pool, to which you add the letters just won: you&rsquo;ll always have access to them but they won&rsquo;t contribute to the bid total. At the end of the game, everyone uses the letters they&rsquo;ve accumulated to make one last word, and the most valuable word wins the game.<br/><br/>The value of a lot depends on the letters in it and their utility in making new words, but also on which of those letters entered the game Live or Dead, which letters you&rsquo;re willing to flip to gain them, and how all those factors relate to the other players and their pool of letters. Tricky letters like Q and Z will double the value of your bid, while the dreaded S will subtract from your bid total &ndash; do you use it now so you can flip it to its Dead side, so it can be used without penalty in a later auction?<br/><br/>It's an auction game where you&rsquo;re spending your resources but they&rsquo;re still available, where you must spend money to make money but it&rsquo;s not a matter of how much money you have at the end &ndash; you might have $20 worth of letters but if you can&rsquo;t find a way to make them all fit into a word, they&rsquo;re going to be worthless.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Who is the Master of Sudoku? 2 to 4 players can compete for this title. Of course there are puzzles for adults (100 pieces) on 9x9 fields. But children have also been thought of; they play on 6x6 fields on the back of the game board (50 puzzles). After a puzzle has been chosen, you place the starting lineup with the corresponding chips on the game board. From now on you reveal chips and try to fit them into the game board. There must be no contradiction to the Sudoku rules; i.e. no number appears twice in a row, column or square. But you can't ponder endlessly, the hourglass runs relentlessly.<br/><br/>When placing the chips, make sure that the marking is facing you. This is the only way to determine at the end who placed which chips. Naturally, the chips are not very clear in up to 5 orientations; it is best to look at the colors instead of the numbers.<br/><br/>There is a reward for whoever was able to place the most valuable chips in a complete (!) row/column/square. That's exactly the crux of the matter: Due to the placement rules, a complete Sudoku can never be created, and complete rows/columns/squares are also the exception. I advocate for the highest sum in an area, regardless of whether it is ultimately completed or not.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can also play solo with Sudoku Master, but this is often difficult due to the lack of note-taking options.<br/><br/>Furthermore, two variants have been included that turn Sudoku into a game of chance: One is Sudoku-Lucky Number, the other is Sudoku-Dragon. In Sudoku-Lucky Number, all the number chips are distributed on the game board and you turn one chip over. If he doesn't contradict any Sudoku rules, he can stay put. However, if there is a contradiction, you have to accept it. In the end, whoever's chips have the lowest total wins. A similar process can be found in Challenge Sudoku, but it is solved better there: chips that have already been taken can be installed later in appropriate places. This means that some of the luck is lost, as anyone who uncovers more high numbers (and has to take them) has no chance of winning in Sudoku Master.<br/><br/>Sudoku Dragon is the worst thing I've ever encountered: you choose a puzzle and give it a clue. Again you have time until the hourglass runs through once. During this time you reveal chips that you must immediately put on the game board. For every chip already lying on a vertically, horizontally or diagonally adjacent field there is a winning chip - so up to 8 pieces at once. It's no surprise that the 27 chips are quickly gone. From this point on you take chips away from your opponents. Counting the chips takes up most of the time and doesn't allow the game to flow.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

The &ldquo;Special Edition&rdquo; game was designed by the editorial staff of &ldquo;Paris Match&rdquo;. The game mechanism is inspired by Trivial Pursuit. We move pawns on a board, we draw a card from the theme corresponding to the square, and we must answer the ten questions asked.<br/>The six themes are:<br/>Science, technology and health (green);<br/>Fashion and Lifestyles (Turquoise);<br/>Politics and political events (blue);<br/>Culture and entertainment (purple);<br/>Sports and adventures (red);<br/>Miscellaneous news and love stories (yellow).<br/>The period of events goes from 1949 until the end of the eighties.<br/>Each time a player answers a question correctly, he earn a token in the color of the theme. On the other hand, if he is wrong, it is up to his neighbor on the left to answer, and so on until the list of ten questions on the card is exhausted. When a player manages to accumulate 10 tokens, he wins a crown of the same color, which he stacks on his pawn. The winner is the one who first get the six crowns.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards: treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players &quot;kicks down the door&quot;, drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels, and players must try to overcome it using the levels, weapons, and powers they have acquired during the game &mdash; or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>Munchkin Big Box contains the Munchkin base game, six expansions that were previously released on their own, and fifty new cards &mdash; more than 650 in all. Also included are a game board, a side board, standees, Kill-O-Meters, dice, other components required for play, and some stuff that's just for looks.<br/><br/>",

It is an evolution of the 20-year old Legends of Boxing with new development inspired by other Stone Mountain Press games, such as Stone Cold Hockey and Dice United 2nd Edition.<br/><br/>LOB2 has also been balanced based on data from LOB for Windows. More depth has been achieved with the new High Action chart, which activates certain ratings in interesting ways, bringing more twists and turns to the action. Game play has been streamlined. Twenty heavyweights have revised ratings, including new versions of Ali in the 70s, and Foreman in the 90s. Fighters are now presented in a quality, magazine-style catalogue, including a section describing why the fighter is rated a certain way in the context of the game.<br/><br/>NOTE: LOB2 is completely backwards compatible with 1st Edition fighter cards, with the exception of three fighters who have Mode Cost Traits (Locche, Padilla, and Hamed).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This contained tabletop RPG plays like a board game with physical maps and dice, assisted by our Loremaster app, which acts as the game master. You and your band of heroes must navigate a gauntlet of cunning traps and monstrous denizens. Amidst the dangers lies the promise of untold wealth, a tantalizing reward to beckon adventurers.<br/><br/>Each journey through the Labyrinth is a uniquely  generated adventure consisting of 5 encounters, ensuring endless replayability. Conquer each encounter to earn XP, loot, and prestige, empowering your heroes for future challenges. The Labyrinth utilizes the core Pericle rules and game mechanics found in Pericle: Gathering Darkness, creating a familiar yet thrilling experience.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, if you make the right pattern, you can win the game instantly!<br/><br/>To set up, lay out a wheel of eight cards, then place the deck in the center of this wheel. As on a clock, a card to the right of another card is considered to be &quot;after&quot; that card, and a card to the left is &quot;before&quot;. Each card features one of eight objects, one of five colors, and one of two suits.<br/><br/>On a turn, everyone draws a card from the deck and looks at it simultaneously. Whoever thinks that they can create a new pattern plays their card on top of another in the wheel, then identifies their pattern, such as after every red card is a gun or before every dynamite is a bullet. A pattern must include an object, and it can occur one or more times.<br/><br/>If a pattern is true for all instances &mdash; for example, a gun is indeed present after every red card &mdash; then the pattern creator claims one or two cards from the wheel depending on whether the pattern includes a color or a suit. If the pattern relates to all eight cards, the player wins instantly. (If the pattern is invalid, then everyone else claims a card from the wheel.)<br/><br/>Refill the wheel, then continue taking turns until someone has claimed at least five cards, at which time everyone cashes in their cards at the bank, earning from 20 cents to $3. If someone has exactly five different colors or exactly five of the same object, they win instantly. Otherwise, if someone has a total of at least $3, they win. If no one has this much money, play another round.<br/><br/>Alternatively, you can play the whoever has the least money at the end of a round is eliminated. Keep playing rounds until one player remains.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns either committing a vote (a disc) to one of the seven colleges, or permanently shifting the border between two colleges by one seat.  Once everyone has passed, dropping out of the game, the player with plurality in each college wins all the valid votes therein.  Tied players in a college cancel each other, so in a three-player game, a 50-50 split would give the college to the third player, even if she had no votes there.  Additionally, each player has a secret color to which they can play invalid votes, which will be removed before tabulation of the college.  This also means that those votes are not awarded to the winner of that college.  Finally, each player has a secret &quot;fetish stone&quot; in the inner ring.  If you win the college containing your fetish stone, you win two bonus votes.  The player with the plurality in final votes wins - respecting the same unforgiving rule for ties as is used for the colleges!<br/><br/>The High Druid is an official game for Stonehenge: An Anthology Board Game.<br/><br/>",

A randomized map ensures no two missions will ever be the same.<br/><br/>Based on the award-winning graphic novel Nordguard: Across Thin Ice, this set comes packed with over 120 illustrations by the artists Tess Garman &amp; Teagan Gavet, as well as four custom-etched dice.<br/><br/>Each game starts by shuffling a deck of Location cards and laying them out to form a different map for each play through. The team then studies this map while selecting their Character and Item cards. Each character has unique skills and abilities to give the team an edge in various areas. Various Item cards equip the team against the dangers of the landscape and its inhabitants. The team travels in a group and must make it from their start point at Frontier to the Destination card within a limited number of turns. Each turn, the team draws an Event card &mdash; which may help or hinder them. Your team wins or loses depending on whether you all reach the destination in time.<br/><br/>",

This would be easy &mdash; except that the person drawing the line is blindfolded and must receive direction from the other players. All other players form a line and have different means of communicating where to draw the line next. A complex chain of hampered communication forms in which information is lost or misinterpreted, making the simple task of drawing a line quite challenging.<br/><br/>With four different tracks and many difficulty levels as well as a team vs. team variant, this party game does not become stale and can be played countless times!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Does Rio de Janeiro or Sydney indicate a higher average temperature? And does London or Rome have more annual rainfall? These are just a few questions, where the players need to find an answer. TIn doing so it is not necessary to know the exact values, but rather to estimate and compare them in between different countries and cities. Through the different categories of questions the game offers a lot of variety and excitement.<br/><br/>Another special feature of World-Facts is its internationality. Via translations of all categories into 5 languages, global topics and the frequent use of symbols, World-Facts overcomes the usual focus of quiz games on just one language and culture. Thus, World-Facts is very suitable for multicultural groups as well.<br/><br/>",

Some cards have a parachute symbol and other don't. the more parachute you get, the more you multiply the value of the points you take in the last turn.<br/><br/>In your turn you can draw a card or play a card (not both) and you can have a maximum of 3 cards in your hand.<br/><br/>If two parachutists are on the same zone, they entangle each other and they start &quot;fighting&quot;, they both throw the dice and the winner pushes the other in another free landing zone, but the looser won't take any points at the end of the round. in case of draw, the one that has been moved, return wherever it was.<br/><br/>Fast, easy, funny with high interactivity with other players and lots of laughs with the illustrations of Angelo Porazzi.<br/><br/>check it out at<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.worldoftwilights.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.worldoftwilights.com</a><br/><br/>Woosh and Giorgio Vezzini will be present at Essen Fair 2009 Angelo Porazzi Games booth 30 Hall 9.<br/><br/>",

Players assume the roll of penguins who slap each other with fish! (Slapping in the sense of playing a card, not physically slapping your opponents or the table) The last penguin holding fish is the winner!<br/><br/>The game consists of 2 decks of cards, Penguin Personas cards and fish cards. Each player assumes the roll of one of the Penguin Personas cards. These personas are comical and give them special abilities in the game.<br/><br/>There are 4 different colors (or suits) of fish cards. Red fish contain attack cards, yellow fish are counter-attack cards, blue fish help you draw more cards, and green fish are items and equipment. The fish cards are colored on both sides so you can see what color (or suit) of fish your opponents have, but you don't know exactly what *kinds* of fish they have. (Is that a red SLAP fish, or a red STEAL fish?) Each player also has two randomly-shuffled draw piles to choose from, so they can strategically pick which colored fish to draw depending on what's available.<br/><br/>Players take turns catching and slapping each other with fish, but have to be careful! Their opponent could counter their slap back to them, increasing it's power! With 4 different colors of fish you can strategically build your hand to defend or attack!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;War in the Megacity&quot; is a two-player simulation of hypothetical near-future battles fought in metropolitan areas with populations of 10 million or more, and it&rsquo;s designed by Joseph Miranda. The objective is to show the spectrum of conflict &mdash; conventional, special operations and unconventional &mdash; used in this type of fighting on the grand-tactical level. There are two sides, both controlled by a player, the Insurgent, who wants to seize control of the city. Opposing him in that effort is the Government player.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Infowar Index&rdquo; is central to play. Each player has one, which indicates how successful he is in achieving his goals &mdash; and representing the amount of overall public support each side is getting.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents from two days to two weeks of &lsquo;real time,&rsquo; depending on the tempo and scope of the activities conducted in each one. The various units represent force sizes &ndash; most either task-organized or spontaneously generated at street-level &ndash; varying in size between battalions and brigades: anywhere from about 500 to 5,000 personnel.<br/><br/>Megacity has a number of unusual subsystems. For one, victory in battle isn&rsquo;t always reckoned in terms of physically destroying the enemy but, rather, in fighting him in such a way as to get the media&rsquo;s reporting squarely on your side. Another important aspect of the game is that certain combat results cause units to get stronger, as they gain in cohesion and tactical expertise.<br/><br/>The system has antecedents in earlier games, in particular, Jim Dunnigan's &ldquo;Chicago, Chicago!&rdquo; It presented the first wargame approach to confrontations between police and demonstrators during the protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. It was one of the first attempts to model modern urban warfare, albeit in a &ldquo;battle&rdquo; in which no one was killed though there was plenty of havoc in the streets.<br/><br/>Counterfact magazine #9<br/><br/>",

Using the basic mechanics of Chess, there's an additional layer of strategy due to each card entering play hidden from the opposing player's view.<br/><br/>On their turn, each player flips a face-down card so it is face up, and then moves any face-up card. He or she then announces check, if applicable. If no check is announced, then a card is placed face down, and a new card is drawn from the deck. If you can set traps and lure your opponent into making mistakes, you might be able to snatch their King and ransom him for control of the kingdom!<br/><br/>This deluxe version contains all the cards in the original King's Ransom game, plus an additional 10 new piece types, 110 new cards (for a total of 160), and instructions for a four-player variation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Xoliba is a fast-paced, surprising and totally new abstract strategy game. It has no standard starting position. Instead, before each game a new starting position is created by placing game pieces on the board at random. As there are billions of possible starting positions, each game is different from the next. Because the starting position is randomized, it seldom offers equal opportunities for both players and you may well need luck to win. Sometimes you can find yourself much worse off from the very beginning; in such positions all what you can do is to minimize your loss. Do not get discouraged: Xoliba is played in matches and the next game might well be yours.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to create triangles. The game is won by the player who has the biggest triangle on the board when the game ends. Moves are made by changing places of the player's own piece and a neutral white piece in such a manner that a new triangle is formed. If such a triangle contains player's own or opponent's pieces, they are captured. The game ends when no new triangles can be formed. The winner scores points from enemy pieces that have been captured. The match is won by the player who is the first to reach or exceed 50 points. Of course, it is not obligatory to play up to 50 points. If the players so wish, they can also play shorter or longer matches, for example, up to 35 points.<br/><br/>Equipment<br/><br/>7x7 octagonal board with 45 intersections (corners cut off), points, where horizontal, oblique, and vertical lines cross each other. Game pieces are 57 discs. Each disc has a white side but the colour of the opposite side varies: in 17 discs it is red, in 17 discs it is blue, in 12 it is green and in 11 it is white.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Nile Ran Red is a collection of three standalone card games set in a mythical ancient Egypt. Illustrated by John Ariosa, these card games all pit players against each other with a common goal: extending control over the land of the Nile. While all three games share a common theme and a common aesthetic, they are vastly different mechanically and no games share common components or art. With this collection of games, up to eleven players can be accommodated at once &mdash; albeit by playing different games.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>In Lords of the Sand, each player takes on the role of one of four different gods: Anubis, Thoth, Sobek, and Khnum. Each god has its own unique agenda and special abilities.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the game, players use Units, complete their court, use special abilities, and build temple complexes. With a combo-driven card system, as cards are played, additional actions may spawn multiple abilities, but a limited action system keeps downtime to a minimum.<br/><br/>Lords of the Sand offers multiple paths to victory, unique card play, and various special abilities with a playing time of about thirty minutes, plus ten minutes for each player above two.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>In Rise of the First Dynasty, 3-5 players vie for control over the whole of Egypt as the potential leader of the mythical first Dynasty of the ancient land along the Nile.<br/><br/>Each player has a set of three identical actions. Played over ten Aeons (or rounds), in each Aeon each player chooses one of his action cards. Depending on the actions chosen by each other players, the player will gain actions, such as conquering new lands, blessing the lands he has already conquered, or using Edict cards to thwart the other players' plans and protect his own. Light, quick, and downright dirty, Rise of the First Dynasty plays in around 30 minutes and scales well regardless of players.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>In Crimson Sun, two players take on the role of leaders of Upper and Lower Egypt. Playing units of four unique gods (Kuk, Babi, Horus, and Sekmet), players build their forces and attempt to assert influence over four key structures. Players may choose to either draft decks at the beginning of the game, or use a single deck.<br/><br/>During the game, players use the Unit cards in a variety of ways to increase his overall strength, to use special abilities, or to secretly try to gain control over the structures. The core mechanisms of this game are pulled from a previous Small Box Games release &mdash; Bhazum &mdash; but mechanical and thematic changes have lead to a game that should be a fresh experience for players already familiar with the earlier game.<br/><br/>",

Each piece may move one square towards any direction shown on the piece, but may jump over or swap positions with allied pieces, which makes the game quicker and more dynamic. The lion, however, may only move to capture or to swap positions.

        "description": "During Ming and Qing Dynasties, merchants originated from Huizhou were among the most successful ones in China. They built their own business empire with massive capital and outstanding business talents. In this game, each player will act as one of the Huizhou merchants, competing with opponents. Players shall send out family members to execute activities like purchasing, constructing, doing salt business, running stores, cooperating with government and increasing their fame. The goal is to achieve recognition from government and local people in the form of building archways. When a single player has built four archways, the game is about to end, and the player with the most victory points shall win the game.<br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>徽商作為一支重要的商幫，其商業資本之巨，活動範圍之廣，經商能力之強，從業人數之多，在商界首屈一指。玩家在遊戲中將扮演一位徽商，與其他玩家競爭，玩家派遣自己的族人進行採購，建設，行商，外出行鹽，建造商鋪，官府捐贈、攀聲望，讓自己的商號得到國家和地方的認可，獲得各種牌坊。當有人獲得四個牌坊後觸發結束條件，看誰是最成功的商人（分數最多），誰將獲得勝利。<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To set up the game, 22 magic ingredient tiles that show mushrooms, spiders, frogs and the assistants themselves are shuffled, placed into two even stacks, then covered with a &quot;book&quot; cover.<br/><br/>To start the first round, the book cover is &quot;opened&quot; so that four ingredient tiles are revealed (the &quot;recipe&quot;). Players then race to assemble their cauldrons and place them on their fireplaces; after doing so, they then rotate the fireplaces and mark the locations from which they can see the ingredients needed to complete the potion. The cauldrons tiles have mirrors on half of them, so a mushroom on one tile might be reflected in the mirror, thus giving a player two mushrooms for a potion. Similarly, a half mushroom can be made whole with a mirror.<br/><br/>Once a player thinks he has marked exactly the number and type of ingredients he needs, he ends the round. If he created the potion correctly, he moves his pawn two spaces on the track; otherwise everyone else advances one space on the track. Players then disassemble their cauldrons, flip over two ingredients tiles (thereby showing a new recipe), and start the next round.<br/><br/>If an assistant shows up on an ingredient tile, that player advances two spaces after cooking ends that round. At a certain point in the game, a mouse comes to aide the player in last place, providing all the mushrooms that player needs.<br/><br/>Der verflixte Zaubertrank ends when all recipes have been used or a player reaches the final space on the track. The player who advances the farthest on the track wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to become a monopolist, that is, to remain the last &quot;financier&quot; in the game after everyone else has gone bankrupt.<br/> On their turn, each player rolls the dice and ventures on the board, between the purchase of land, stations or companies, the payment of rents and the construction of houses and hotels, the surprises represented by the contingency and probability cards, and the reassuring withdrawal of the salary every time, after completing a tour, you pass the VIA. When a player does not have enough money or property to pay a rent or honor a debt to the bank or another player, he goes bankrupt and leaves the game. Whoever manages to best manage their finances, balancing investments with a wise availability of cash to face any misfortune, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The deck consists of green cards numbered 1-40 and red cards numbered 10-30. Players start with ten cards in hand with 2-3 players and eight cards with 4-6 players. Set the deck nearby with the top card revealed.<br/><br/>The start player plays any card to the center of the table. The next player must play a card at most ten lower or higher than this card, e.g., playing 14-34 if the 24 was lead. If the second-played card is lower (higher), then all subsequent cards must be lower (higher) &mdash; but also always within ten of the most recently played card. If a player cannot or doesn't want to play, they pass and draw the top card of the deck, then reveal the new top card. If all players pass in turn, then whoever played the most recent card clears the table and leads a new card.<br/><br/>Two exceptions:<br/><br/>1. If the next player in turn can play a green card exactly ten lower or higher than the topmost card on the pile (no matter the direction of play), that player can call &quot;Mount Ten!&quot;, play the card, then clear the table and lead a new card.<br/><br/>2. If any player can play a red card exactly ten lower or higher than the topmost card on the pile (no matter the direction of play), that player can call &quot;Mount Ten!&quot;, play the card, then clear the table and lead a new card.<br/><br/>When one player has no cards in hand, the round ends. Each player with cards in hand scores -1 for each green card and -2 for each red card; the player who went out scores positive points equal to all the negative points scored that round. Complete as many rounds as the number of players, with the start player rotating each round. Whoever then has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Analyst Game was developed jointly by consumer psychologist Adam Ferrier and ideas company Saatchi &amp; Saatchi. It was borne out of a realization that a) people love hearing what others think about them, and b) people enjoy having the opportunity to safely express what they think about others. The Analyst gives people the chance to understand their friends and family on a deeper level. In return you'll gain a deeper understanding of how others see you.<br/><br/>This boardgame (without a board!) works like this: an Analyst asks questions about a randomly-drawn subject. The Trainee Analysts must provide insightful but not obvious answers about the subject's character. The Analyst must then guess who the subject is. Points are awarded and we move to the next round. Simple ... and fun!<br/><br/>The techniques used in this game are used by therapists and advertising agencies when they want to gain a deeper understanding of people, why they do things and what really drives them. For example during the Bush / Gore election campaign, planning departments in advertising agencies asked people if the presidential candidates came to life as cars, what kind of car would they be? George Bush was seen as a Maserati, Al Gore was a Honda Accord. I'll leave it to you to draw your own conclusions as to why!<br/>(Taken Directly from the webpage)<br/><br/>",

Ten cards and randomly discarded, then the player draws 10 cards from a shuffled deck.  The player may then discard any number of cards, drawing 2 cards to replace each card discarded.  The player can choose any or no suit as trump.<br/><br/>To play a trick, the top card from the deck is flipped up and the player then chooses a card from their hand to play.  The player must follow suit (or play the joker).  The highest card played of the trump suit wins; otherwise the highest card played of the led suit.  (The joker is the highest overall card.)

        "description": "In the two-player game Quadrio, players compete to be the first to place four discs in a row &mdash; but it's tricky to do so since the discs can move to new locations as players rotate the plastic device that serves as the playing area.<br/><br/>The playing field is a 4x4 grid that's overlaid with troughs on each side of it, with troughs on opposite sides of the field running perpendicular to one another. On a turn, a player slides one of their discs into a trough. That's it! Before or after inserting a disc, a player can hold the device by any of the four corners and turn it to look at either side. When a player grabs a different corner and holds the device by it, discs inside might slide in their troughs to new positions. Have you created a four-in-a-row of your discs (on one or a combination of both sides of the playing area) after taking your turn? If so, you win!<br/><br/>Games of Quadrio can be quick as it's hard to keep an eye on all eight possible orientations of the device. Thus, the publisher recommends playing multiple rounds, such as seeing who can first win three games out of five.<br/><br/>",

The game is free to print &amp; play!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, players chose who will play as brown and who will play as beige.<br/>Each turn a player must draw a tile and add it to his/her hand. He/She then chooses one for the two tiles in his hand and places it in the game area. To place a tile, at least two of the six edges must connect to a tile already present. It is possible to stack a tile on top of others if there is no empty gap underneath (the rule of the 2 edges connection does no apply in this case).<br/><br/>The game ends when all tiles have been placed.

        "description": "Described by the Publisher/Designer:<br/><br/>M K Morrison developed Big Battle over a number of years. He fine tuned it by play testing against an international chess master in New Zealand. Big Battle is a chess variant played on a 10 by 10 chess board. It has two new pieces called Princes which combine the powers of the chess knight and the Big Battle Queen. The Big Battle queen in addition to the powers of the ordinary chess queen can also jump over an immediately adjacent piece. The pawns (called soldiers in Big Battle) can move one two or threes squares; not just on their first moves but for any move. It makes for a pretty sharp end game. Almost all the pieces in Big Battle have enhanced powers when compared to their chess counterparts. There have been a number of Big Battle tournaments in New Zealand, including two national tournaments. You can find out more about Big Battle at the Chess Variants page or at Zillions of games. They have a script for playing Big Battle.<br/><br/>",

Stay one step ahead of your opponents, as you race to be the first player to play all your country cards on the table and win the game. Block your opponents by holding on to Mexico or Colombia or open up South America by playing Brazil. Take a boat through the Caribbean Sea to Cuba or transit by train through the USA to Canada. Try not to get stuck with Suriname, or miss a boat to the Bahamas as you watch the country cards spread across the table. The excitement builds as you have fewer and fewer cards left to play, but less space to play them in as you reach the edge of the world. (The table&rsquo;s edge). Every country card is different due to their varying border connections and hence no two games are ever the same in this clever game that you will want to play again and again. Play as a stand alone game or combine with Mapominoes games for other continents to make to expand the game to cover the world. A simple game with hidden strategic depth that gives it broad appeal to both children and adults.<br/><br/>",

Be the first person to complete a route to win.<br/><br/>On each turn, play one of your roadway tiles somewhere on the game board. You don't have to play the tiles in any particular order, and your route doesn't need to be straight - but over the twists and turns it must eventually create a path joining your color on both sides of the game board. Remember that all players share the roadway system, so try not to help someone finish ahead of you. After playing a roadway tile, draw a replacement and then the next player on your left takes their turn. Only after a tile has been surrounded on all four sides, players may stack a different tile on top of it, changing the route dramatically!<br/><br/>",

Be careful because the entire game is a balancing act! The player with the fewest toppled furnishings at the end of the game is the winner or if you'd rather, be the one to finish stacking all your furnishings first!<br/><br/>Some may know the game Chairs... this is incredibly similar except you have both tables and chairs, not just chairs to work with! This variation of the game &quot;Chairs&quot; provides new surfaces &amp; chair shapes to stack and balance. Think you can balance that round table on the square chair with holes in it? How about putting that 3-legged chair upside down on a short long coffee table piece.<br/><br/>Game comes with 3 different color tables and chairs of varying shapes and sizes.

Use your influence to manipulate your opponents and place your bids to win agents to your organization.<br/><br/>Sub Rosa: Spies for Hire is a bidding, bluffing, area control microgame. On a player's turn, they place a token from their hand on one the secret agent cards in play; that token can be placed face-down to act as a bid, or face-up to use that agent's special ability. Once all tokens have been placed, the player who has won the most bids on agents wins the game. From these simple rules, a lot of opportunities arise for bluffing, tricking and manipulating your opponents.<br/><br/>The base game comes with 32 variable set-ups for a 4-player game, allowing for dynamic shifts in strategy and for some unique bluffing opportunities.<br/><br/>",

Then Empatia is right for you! In Empatia you&rsquo;ll try to guess what other players like, and what is not their cup of tea. Empatia is a game filled with marvelous eerie illustrations &ndash; and your task is to find among them the ones that other players like the best. You have to empathize with them to choose correctly; you have to discover why they like a given picture more than the others &ndash; Is it the colors? Shapes? The person in the middle? A cute animal? Empatia is not a game for the cold-hearted, that&rsquo;s for sure!<br/><br/>- What&rsquo;s in the box? 68 large-sized cards with illustrations; 12 cards with numbers; 6 plastic diamonds; 1 cardboard scoring sheet; 6 wooden player tokens; 36 cardboard tokens; rulebook<br/>- Beautiful and magical artwork<br/>- Easy-to-learn rules<br/>- 2 game modes &ndash; competitive and cooperative<br/><br/>Gameplay (basic version):<br/><br/>Each player has 6 cards in their hands. One player will be the judge of the round and gets rid of one card of which he thinks he will not need during the next rounds. His fellow players all choose one card (or two if there are only two or three players) they think the judge will like most. The judge shuffles the cards. All pictures are then shown face up. The fellow players try and guess which two cards the judge likes most (and which of these two is the absolute top) and get points according to the accuracy of their guesses. The first player to get 30 points wins.<br/><br/>Gameplay (cooperative play)<br/><br/>Twelve cards are laid face up on the table. The first player must find a key of exactly two words (prepositions and conjunctions don't count) that matches 3 of the cards on the table. The fellow players must then try and find not only those 3 cards, but also in which order the player would line them up (from the one that matches best the key to the one that matches it only better than the 9 remaining cards). The team then gets points according to their answers.<br/><br/>The purpose is to get most point as a team. According to the number of points reached, you will know how well you know each other.<br/><br/>",

Can you help Little Fox succeed?<br/><br/>Aim of the game: <br/>Being the first to complete 5 tasks.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>The 10 Indian path tiles are placed in a circle in random order. 7 tiles show tasks. The remaining 3 tiles show the sun, moon and the wise shaman. The 28 bush tiles are placed around the Indian path (on the face-down side, they show the same pictures as the ones on the path tiles). Each player gets a teepee board that has 5 slots for bush tiles. The Little Fox token is placed on the shaman path tile.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Players take turns rolling the die and advancing Little Fox the corresponding number of spaces on the Indian path. If Little Fox lands on a task tile, the active player turns over a bush tile. If the bush tile shows the same picture as the task tile, the player gets to keep it and place it on his/her teepee board. If it is the wrong bush tile, it remains face-up.<br/>If Little Fox lands on the sun tile, three bush tiles are turned over, then the die is rolled again. If Little Fox lands on the moon tile, all bush tiles that are face-up are turned face-down again. If Little Fox lands on the shaman tile, the player gets to take a tile of their choice.<br/><br/>The first player to have collected 5 bush tiles (= to have completed 5 tasks) wins the game.<br/><br/>Variants to increase difficulty include immediately turning bush tiles face-down again, and letting only the active player see a bush tile on the moon space.<br/><br/>",

A system of Attack, Defense and Special cards, everyone with a humorous comment, are used for bonus movements, stops, putting pawns under investigation and/or in prison, and so on.<br/>When 7 pawns reach the inside of the Parliament, they can share the 7 Minister seats, that have a different point value. Each pawn counts for one vote. But if players do not agree, the game goes on so more pawn will enter and both the number of votes and candidates will vary. If 13 pawns reach the Parliament, a special procedure to ensure a government is adopted.<br/>The score is partially open and partially secret, so not to show openly who is going to win and leave the game of alliance and bargains open. The first one to reach 51 points (usually after 2 or 3 governments) is the winner.<br/>Since Italian election system changed abruptly just after 1993, the authors developed optional rules for the &quot;Sistema maggioritario&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quick-play introduction to the classic game Monopoly. Be the player with the most money at the end of the game!<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s all about raking in the rent by putting your tokens on as many properties as you can. But beware, any property you own can be snatched by the next player who lands there. On your turn roll, move your token, and then pay rent, buy, build or auction. When you land on any colored property space, you can build on it &ndash; even if someone else owns it. The building tokens have a number on them and they can only be played if they are the next highest token. Look out for the special die that helps build or demolish properties. Properties and utilities cannot be mortgaged in Monopoly Express. If you run out of money, the game is over. The player with the most money wins<br/><br/>Gameboard, 32 colored property tokens (8 per player), 8 Chance cards, 8 Community Chest cards, 2 Utility cards, 4 movers, a money pack, and a die.<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of the turn the top card of chameleon stack is revealed. The card has two features: terrain and chameleon. Players will then locate the tile with corresponding terrain and time. Time is determined by the number of already made photos, so if for example a purple chameleon by the waterfall is revealed and players already captured two such chameleons, players will need to take the tile with waterfall and two time sections. A player who has six different chameleons immediately wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Each card depicts an object. Simultanously, all players look at their cards and try to spot the same object on the board, claiming each find.

The player then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player two and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to player one to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the BrainBox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins! For 1 or more players, ages 8+. Contains 54 illustrated cards, 1 rules card, 1 timer and 1 eight sided die.

        "description": "Arctic Race is a family game of tactical racing in polar surroundings. In the game all players sponsor two dog sled teams, and the player whose both teams have reached the North Pole first, wins.<br/><br/>Each player is dealt a card showing the two teams that the player sponsors. The players keep their cards hidden, so the players' teams are unknown. Several players can share a single team, but only one player can have a specific combination of two teams. The board is built differently for every game out of big ice floats. Several weather hazards surround the ice track at the beginning of the game, and are moved onto the track during the game. The players are granted godlike abilities in the game, as they are allowed to move the hazards on their turn, as well as any dog sled they wish. If a hazard is ever moved into the same space as a dog sled, the dog sled cannot move before the hazard has been moved away.<br/><br/>The game is played by rolling two dice: a movement die and a hazard die. The movement die lets the player move a dog sled 1-4 spaces on the board, and sometimes ALSO lets the player place a crack in the ice on the board. Cracks can only be crossed by using ladder cards that the players have three of when the game starts. Without ladders cracks cannot be crossed and players have to go around them. The hazard die usually lets the player move one of three types of hazards, sometimes it allows a free choice of hazards, and sometimes the player can move no hazard at all. All this makes for a very exciting race, and an entertaining 30+ minutes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on a system favoring the fog of war and the uncertainties of military preparations, &quot;Talvisota 1939-1940: The Soviet-Finnish Winter War&quot; places both players in a situation requiring them to choose their strategies after careful reflection. Maintaining one&rsquo;s war morale is important, but the decisive results are mainly achieved by considering the potential actions of the other side. In the solitaire mode, the player controls the Soviet forces against a Finnish A.I. opponent.  System by Lionel Liron.<br/><br/>Published in VaeVictis #158<br/><br/>--- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---<br/><br/>In 1939, faced with Nazi Germany&rsquo;s expansionist politics, Stalin demands of Finland some strategic territories necessary for the defense of Leningrad. Helsinki refuses and on 30 November, with no prior Declaration of War, the Red Army attacks the Finnish territory with five armies and 28 divisions.<br/><br/>The strength ratio is crushingly in the Soviets&rsquo; favor with 400,000 combatants, 1500 tanks and a modern aviation against 265,000 Finnish soldiers and 20 tanks. To everyone&rsquo;s surprise, the overwhelming numerical and material superiority of the Russians is broken by the fierce resistance and the bravery of the Finnish forces.<br/><br/>Despite a front extending from the Arctic to the isthmus of Karelia, and the offensives of mostly 3 against 1, the lack of preparation and coordination of Stalin&rsquo;s forces, the extreme climatic conditions and the Finnish belligerence jostle all predictions and overturn military logic. Mannerheim&rsquo;s troops employ Molotov cocktails, surprise infiltrations and an optimal exploitation of the terrain to resist the Russian giant until March. But the lack of armament and international support, the limited numbers of troops, and a Soviet surge irreversibly compel the little Nordic outlier to sign an accord on 12 March 1940.<br/><br/>",

In the early 20th century, a small freight train network was build on South Daitou Island (南大東島) to get the sugar cane to the harbor. This railroad network served until 1983.<br/><br/>In the game &lsquo;Daitou&rsquo;, players build sugar cane farms and railroads.

        "description": "Charade what!? Split into teams and face off in a raucous game of charades! Guess the saucy, suggestive, and downright obscene clues in order to score. Or stick it to your rivals with challenging twists to make them suffer. Be sure to peg your opponents with the foam ball when their time is up, or they&rsquo;ll never stop! This rude, rowdy party game will get your mind in the gutter and your friends rolling on the floor!<br/><br/>Contests:  500 Doubles-Sided Cards, 24 Twist Tiles, 1 Sand Timer, 1 Ball, Instructions.<br/><br/>How To Play:<br/><br/>1)  Separate into two teams.  If you have an odd number of players, make the teams as even as possible.<br/><br/>2)  The cards have a green side and a pink side.  Select which color will be used for the entire game.<br/><br/>3)  Shuffle the Twist Tiles and create a face-down draw pile.  Each team draws one tile.<br/><br/>4)  Select which team will guess first and which player from that team will act first (the Actor).<br/><br/>5)  Start the timer!<br/><br/>6)  The Actor draws a card adn acts out the word or phrase.<br/>    Acting Rules:  <br/>    You cannot say words or make any sounds with your mouth.<br/>    You cannot mouth any words or write any letters in the air.<br/><br/>7   The Actor's team shouts out guesses.  When a teammate guesses the card, the Actor draws another card and keeps going.<br/><br/>8)  At the end of the turn, collect the cards that were correctly guessed and put them in a score pile for the team.  Any cards that were not guessed are removed from the game.<br/><br/>9)  Now it's the other team's turn.  Continue taking turns, alternating teams, and selecting a different actor each time.<br/><br/>Twist Tiles:  Mess With Your Opponents<br/><br/>Correctly guess cards with a Twist icon to earn tiles that will sabotage the other team or give your team an advantage.<br/><br/>1) At the start of a turn, the team that's not guessing may choose to play ONE of their Twist Tiles.  Then the guessing team may choose to play ONE of their Twist Tiles.<br/><br/>2)  Read each played tile out loud and follow the rule written on it for the entire turn. (Rules affecting the Actor may be suspended in order to draw and read cards, but must be followed when acting out the card.)<br/><br/>PASS ONE CARD:  These Twist Tiles do not need to be played at the start of the turn.  If the guessing team has one of these tiles, they may play it at any time in order to skip a card.<br/><br/>3)  At the end of the turn, the guessing team draws one Twist Tile for each correctly guessed card with a Twist icon on it.<br/><br/>4)  Review all of the Twist Tiles earned that turn.  Select ONE to keep and discard the rest.<br/><br/>5)  Create a discard pile of any played or discarded Twist Tiles.  If the draw pile runs out, shuffle the discard pile.<br/><br/>NOTE:  There is no limit to the number of Twist Tiles a team can have.<br/><br/>THE BALL:  The Timer Doesn't End The Turn - You Do!<br/>When the timer runs out, any member of the throwing team (the team that is not guessing) may throw the ball at the Actor.<br/><br/>- If the actor dodges the ball, they may continue acting out clues and scoring.  The throwing team has to keep taking shots!<br/><br/>- If the Actor is hit with the ball, the turn ends.<br/><br/>- If the Actor catches the ball, the turn ends, but the guessing team draws an additional Twist Tile before selecting one to keep.<br/><br/>THROWING RULES:<br/><br/>- Not in the face!<br/>- Inf the ball misses, a member of the throwing team must retrieve the ball and return to their original seat before throwing it again.<br/><br/>Note:  The guessing team may warn the Actor when the timer is getting low, but they cannot interfere with throwing.<br/><br/>WINNERS!:  After all players have had a chance to act, count up the cards in each team's score pile.  Whichever team has the most cards is the winner!<br/><br/>Note:  If one team is larger, one member of the smaller team will be the Actor again, so both teams take the same number of turns.  Want a longer game?  Have everyone be the Actor two or three times before counting your score.<br/><br/>DELINQUENTS:  At some point, someone is going to screw up.  Here's what to do...<br/><br/>- If an acting rule or Twist Tile rule is broken, the card being acted is removed from the game and the guessing team cannot score it.  The Actor draws another card and continues their turn.<br/><br/>- If a throwing rule is broken, the throw does not count.  The throwing team must throw again.<br/><br/>- If the guessing team intercepts the ball or interferes with a throw, the turn immediately ends.<br/><br/>",

Then, you will draw a card from a 40-card deck. All the cards in the deck have two of these animals of different colors on them. Your job is to find which animal or color is not represented on the card at all, and slap that reference card. You then claim the card that was flipped over. If there is an exact match (i.e. a green frog), disregard the other rule and slap that exact reference card. You then claim the card that was flipped over.<br/><br/>Play proceeds until all the cards in the deck have been claimed -- most cards is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Portable and quick to learn, it&rsquo;s perfect for caf&eacute;s, train journeys, and lunch breaks.<br/><br/>Develop your influence across a constantly shifting realm by claiming powerful relics belonging to one of ten noble houses, all while making subtle maneuvers to thwart your opponent&rsquo;s plans.<br/><br/>Each relic you hold allows you to manipulate the position of other relics in regions controlled by the corresponding house. These areas of influence themselves change as the relics move, and often overlap with those of your opponent.<br/><br/>The first player to unite a matching set of four relics wins the game, but as you consolidate your power over one house, your control over the realm diminishes. Dance effortlessly from one alliance to another while quietly establishing your dominance over the realm, until your opponent can do nothing but watch helplessly as you seize the throne!<br/><br/>The crystal staff from the wizard&rsquo;s college, an enchanted lute from the bard&rsquo;s guild, the cutlass of the pirate king, or the black knight&rsquo;s helm; the deck of relics consists of forty cards, each an original painting by legendary artist Sam Ballard.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You have to steal, take, show, sneak peak, expose, ambush, stop other players, grab and even throw an occasional octopus at an opponent on your way to victory.<br/><br/>As players take turns, the game gets more intense because, just like you, everyone is getting closer to solving the mystery pets, yet who is going play the best game, collect the most points and win the game?<br/><br/>We think Shady Pets has all the elements that make games popular. It makes players laugh with its clever sayings and endearing artwork. It presents multiple levels of strategic play that will test your memory and deduction skills.

Players become wizards casting spells and trying to eliminate all their opponents. Spells need both energy runes and activation runes. Players play cards in front of them, one after the other each turn, forming their spell sequence. When a card with an activation rune is played, they choose which energy runes to use to cast a variety of effects.<br/><br/>Unlike in Waving Hands, the spell table is very small with just 10 spells which are grouped by the type of activation rune needed: Moons (spells directed at the caster for protection or healing), Wyrms (spells directed at an opponent, usually damaging) and Knots (more complex effects that can be played on both caster or opponents).

In it, each player is ranked (and seated) according to his wealth (Poor / Thin Ice / Credit Crazy / Upper Crust / Money to Burn / Rich).<br/><br/>The entire deck of 62 cards is dealt out, minus two cards. The first and last player exchange two cards, the next-to-first and next-to-last exchange one. The player to the left of the dealer (the Rich player) begins by playing a set of cards (quantity and face value). The following player can either play the same quantity but higher value or pass. This round continues until all pass; after which another round starts. Players rank (for the next hand) in the order in which they go out.<br/><br/>Score is kept for the agreed upon number of hands (no more than 10). Poor scores 1, Thin Ice 2, etc. High score wins.<br/><br/>Interestingly, the value 5 cards are wild in the sense that a single 5 can represent any number of fives. When played to start a round, the following player determines the quantity. The other cards are Zillionaire (4 in deck), Millionaire (4), Bankroll (3; if played on top of a Bankrupt card, cannot be beaten), Bankrupt (3; can only be beaten by a Bankroll), Bump (3; forces the player to your left to Pass), 8 through 1 (6 of each except for Fives, of which there are only 3).<br/><br/>",

Players move one pawn around on a one way board using numbered tokens from one to three. Only after all players have used all of their tokens they become available to be used again. This constitutes one round, while the game is played for six or eight rounds for three or four players. Each turn the active player has to carry out the action where the pawn lands. These actions inluce buying &amp; selling stocks in four companies, drawing an event card, or one of four more special actions.<br/><br/>Compared to Fund Manager in Super Stocks players have both more power to influence the stock prices and more tools to reduce randomness.

It offered a wooden stock, shaped to nestle in the shoulder, which now meant a gun could be aimed. Politically, France&rsquo;s defeat at Pavia changed the balance of power in Europe.

A hex grid has been superimposed on the map to regulate movement. Each hex represents about 200 yards. The game has 12 turns, each turn representing about 30 minutes. Each combat unit represents from 400 to 800 men or horses or guns.<br/><br/>The game starts with the Spanish army having arrived to relieve the siege of Pavia by the French army. Play is composed of 12 turns.

The player with the highest score chooses 2 of the played cards and puts them on his victory pile. All other players except the last one choose one card. Players then restock their hand to three cards. The game ends when one player has 4 cards of the same minority in his victory pile.

Whoever thinks that Stadt-Land-Vollpfosten can't work well as a card game will soon be proven wrong.<br/><br/>The game is explained in no time and the fun can begin. There are no open questions and the game rounds are entertaining and exciting. Due to the 150 different categories there is always enough variety.<br/><br/>The naughty card game from STADT LAND VOLLPFOSTEN with 120 playing cards for an unforgettable gaming experience among friends.<br/><br/>150 creative and funny categories will make every amateur thinker sweat. Fun guaranteed!<br/><br/>Due to the 3 different editions, a huge variety is offered. In addition to the family-friendly Classic Edition, the child-friendly Junior and the naughty Red Light Edition bring a certain variety to the game night!<br/><br/>How to play: Each player is randomly dealt 8 letter cards. Now each player must place a word matching one of his letter cards as quickly as possible. Important: The first letter of the word counts and you do NOT have to form a term from the letter cards, as is sometimes the case in other games, e.g. Scrabble.<br/><br/>So it gets exciting: The 60 category cards contain a total of 200 different and funny categories:<br/><br/>Who can put down a &quot;profession&quot; first? Or a &quot;reason for separation&quot;? What about a &quot;city abroad&quot;? Can you quickly think of a &quot;Famous Dead Person&quot; or a &quot;Famous Actor&quot; for your letter cards?<br/><br/>Important now: The FASTEST player wins each round and at the end the player who first got rid of all letter cards wins the game. The 10 additional action cards make the game especially exciting.<br/><br/>Of course, there are also FULL FIX cards in the game that either act as jokers or are used as tricky counters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

This becomes the &quot;recently deceased&quot;.<br/><br/>Players start with a hand of cards, with the lead player playing a single card to the center of the table (&quot;the funeral&quot;) that are either in agreement (same suit color) or start a fight (differing suit colors).<br/><br/>Tricks are won by playing the high card when in agreement, or by winning fights (being form the same family as the recently deceased provides a bonus in a fight).  The winner takes the trick and puts the cards into that player's victory point pile (&quot;mead hall&quot;).  Cards are drawn by the player who did not win cards for their mead hall from the deck (&quot;the village&quot;).<br/><br/>Throughout play, players are encouraged to either sing the praises of the &quot;recently deceased&quot; or trash-talk the card, treating each suit as it were an viking family line.  The game ends when no more cards are left in the village to replenish players' hands, and the game is won by the player with the most cards in their mead hall, with a tie breaker going to the player whose mead hall cards have the most wounds (as indicated by marks made to cards during play).<br/><br/>In true viking fashion, the game strongly emphasis that there are no ties, either during play or in calculating victory.<br/><br/>",

Hexover takes a new twist on play pattern with roots dating back to England is the 19th century. The play pattern, which consists of trapping and flipping opponents disks, is familiar to people worldwide who have played Reversi. The object of Hexover is to be the first player to complete a string of five disks in their color on the white hexagons on the game board, with at least one game piece being positioned on the outside row. Because of the hexagonal shape of the game board, players have to stay alert to all of directions impacted by each move. Hexover is a game of planning, positioning and rich strategy. The obvious move, may not be the best! The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Hexover is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.<br/><br/>",

It seems that the area has historically been associated with heavy industrialization, and the game was part of a public relations effort to alter this image.<br/><br/>The board is divided into a hexagonal grid, onto which tiles representing land developments (businesses, industries, parks, an airport, etc.) are placed. Each space has a set of three tiles which can be placed on it, representing the uses to which the land was put &quot;yesterday&quot;, &quot;today&quot;, and &quot;tomorrow&quot;. Players plan the order in which developments occur geographically, using colored cylinders to mark ownership. Each stage of development requires two player markers, promoting negotiation between players as to what happens first. Developments on a given space must be carried out chronologically (ie. in the order &quot;yesterday&quot;, &quot;today&quot;, and &quot;tomorrow&quot;). When a development is completed, the rules allow the acting player to swap markers with those of other players in adjacent spaces, subject to certain limitations, thus expanding his control over the local area. At the end of the game, victory points  are awarded for each development a player controls, with the more advanced developments scoring more points.<br/><br/>",

There is a single counter representing Sherlock Holmes and the players take turns moving it about the board.<br/><br/>The game is played on the board and with a deck of cards. Each cards has a picture of one of the suspects on it and there are two cards for each suspect. At the start of the game one player shuffles the cards and places one face down in the middle of the board. The remaining cards are then dealt out to the players.<br/><br/>Whenever a player lands on a picture of a suspect they must show any cards of that suspect. If they land on an &quot;investigate&quot; space they can examine a card from another player's hand. And, if they land on the &quot;Scotland Yard&quot; space then all players holding pairs of cards (two cards of the same suspect) must show them. Other spaces have special events on them which cause players to exchange hands and the like.<br/><br/>Play continues until one player thinks they know who the culprit is. They announce their choice and check the card in the middle of the board. If they are correct they are the winner. Otherwise they are out of the game and play continues until someone makes the correct guess.<br/><br/>Sherlock Holmes is a variant of the game Clue . The object is to figure out which card is in the middle of the board. Since there will be two cards for every suspect in the player's hands except for this one the idea is to figure out which card doesn't have a match in another hand.<br/><br/>This game was authorized by the Sir. Arthur Conan Doyle estate.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Akindo, players are merchants in Japan during the Edo period. Everyone starts out with a small store, and has to do their best to make it as big as possible.<br/><br/>Each round in Akindo has two phases: Purchase and Barker.<br/><br/>During the Barker phase, the active player rolls three dice and divides them between himself and one other player. This will gain those players coins, depending on the distribution of these dice. However, depending on how things turn out, you may be forced to pay to alter the numbers rolled, so you need to be careful about assigning the dice.<br/><br/>During the Purchase phase, goods are sold on the east and west markets. The players bid on the goods, with the highest bidder gaining the goods.<br/><br/>Collecting sets of goods gains you points. The player who scores the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The objective is to transform your neighborhood from a late-stage capitalist hellscape into a slacker Marxist utopia.<br/><br/>The game is turn-based.  At the beginning of every round new Narratives and Aktions are drawn and voted on, and the police and the Medic will take their turns. There are no discreet game stages, but the early game will likely be focused mainly on looting and burning, which builds up your characters and the POZ.  The Police are quite tough, and players are unlikely to be able to defeat them early on.<br/><br/>When space for building has been cleared out and players have amassed a large enough arsenal, it will be time to bring the fight to the Man.  The police work on a simple AI (similar to Space Hulk).  They will be relatively passive early on but their aggressiveness will increase as the POZ grows.<br/><br/>POZ is semi-cooperative, and there are two conditions for winning:<br/><br/>a) The POZ must be built up, the police must be defeated, and the courthouse must be occupied.  This is a group effort which benefits all players.<br/><br/>b) Once the courthouse is occupied, however, only the player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

As a bandit, it is this place that you decide to rob ... and as much to tell you that you fall badly!<br/><br/>Luckily, Elliot has you in the right, and agrees to teach you the basics of the job. But before, you will have to prove yourself!<br/><br/>Choose the places to point, select your equipment and sharpen your skills to become the biggest gangster in the United States.<br/><br/>Hold-Up is a comic combined with a game, one title in a series subtitled &quot;The comic in which you are the hero&quot;. You embody a character in a immersive story in which your choices guide your progress. You have a character sheet akin to those used in role-playing games that tracks your possessions, your special abilities, your coins, and your victory points. In general, gameplay consists in following the comic's panels &mdash; which contain clues, riddles and traps &mdash; and making choices about where to go and what to do, while using your visual perception to collect clues and be smart enough to resolve the riddles. As in any game, you can lose &mdash; sometimes really badly!<br/><br/>",

Сard Game is a highly thematic board game in which players again take roles of alien generals, invading earth to fill their cargo with intergalactic currency &ndash; humans. Each turn of the game some cites are available for attacks and players simultaneously choose a place to attack, splitting their fleet between cites, if necessary. But one city is too small for two generals &ndash; so if there are multiple players trying to invade a city, their armies will fight and only the strongest will capture the humans! After the round, generals get support &ndash; new ships, as well as the amount of fuel will increase during invasion, making alien fleets larger. After 6 rounds and additional goals scoring the richest player wins.<br/><br/>Changes from board game version: no more game board, each ship grant player cubes and abilities - but no numerical value, only number of success on rolled cubes counts - not numerical values,  now rewards for each city are random and determined by the deck player choose to draw from.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A round happens in two phases:  first, you can take any two of your blocks and place a man on the difference space on your boat (play a 7 and a 3 and place a guy on space 4).  Everyone does this, then phase two begins: now, if you play a pair of numbers you bump the person off that spot on every boat, including your own.  Then the boats move equal to the number of men on the boat.  You draw four new blocks each round and don't need to use them all each turn, allowing a massive build up or bump off spree.  First to the finish line wins.<br/><br/>",

There are blocked spaces where no one can move, and three sets of differently colored &quot;closable&quot; spaces - when an offensive piece is on a colored square, similarly colored squares are off limits to the defense. There are also squares numbered 1 - 3; when a defensive piece lands on one of these, the number is added to the offensive player's move total.<br/><br/>",

Rotating in the opposite direction are blocking pegs, which protect the targets. For younger players, the blocking pegs may be removed.<br/><br/>Players fire marble-like balls (also colored red and yellow to represent the owning player) up slightly inclined ramps from opposite sides of the target gallery, with play continuing until one player has eliminated all of the targets in the opposing player's color.<br/><br/>The whole set-up measures over three feet long when assembled.

But you must weigh up the destruction caused with the political fallout from the images of a burning Fallujah being broadcast around the world.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to capture territory from the insurgency, locate and destroy centers of resistance, capture local insurgency leaders and engage enemy forces in order to regain control of the city.<br/><br/>The game is still a 'work in progress' so any feedback would be greatly appreciated.<br/><br/>",

Zombies don't care about money, political power or fundraising; they only care about brains.

You and your friends are Zombies that wander the streets, looking for delicious brains! On your turn, you draw the top card of the deck and play it for all to see. You will then roll the die to see if you eat the human, if he escapes or hides, or if he kills you.<br/><br/>",

Nevertheless, it must be remembered that the moral loser will always be a faction which decided for the force solution fighting for control over districts as the first and allowing the blood to be spoiled.<br/><br/>The goal of each faction is to gain as many Victory Points as possible, i.e. retain the power in hands of Government and his supporters or to create a new government by the opposition.<br/><br/>Victory Points are scored by taking Control or getting Support in 25 districts, which differs in value. When two factions meet in one district there is a  Struggle (for Support or Control). To win a Struggle, players use Cards which portrays means used to win: Masses (supporters of Government or Euromaidan), Militia, Berkut, Army, Specnaz, Media or Titushki. Cards have different values (value part of them is defined by a dice roll). For example, Media has value 5 in Struggle for Support, and 0 in Struggle for Control.<br/><br/>Players has several types of action to choose: get a Card, initiate a Struggle, influence a district, make an peace offer. 5 Actions made an Action Round. 6 Action Rounds makes an complete game (unless someone get to automatic victory earlier).<br/><br/>Majdan reimplements Pomarańczowa Rewolucja game - mechanics was slightly changed, as district values on the map. Cards was changed (new images and its quantity).<br/><br/>All changes were fit to the 2013/2014 political situation on Ukraine.<br/><br/>",

Lovecraft.<br/><br/>In Cthulhu: The Great Old One (Deluxe), each player takes their turn in order; first drawing, then stealing, then recruiting cards, and finally playing any Pairs they might hold, as well as any one Horror or Cultist card.<br/><br/>Matched Pairs give 2 victory points, Linked Pairs give 1 victory point, as does any played Horror cards.<br/><br/>Once any player completes their 7th pair, the game ends and players count up their victory points.<br/><br/>If any player holds the Great Old One card, they lose the game regardless of points. However, if a player holds the Great Old One and has already played the Cultist card in their play area, they win! Otherwise, the player with the most victory points wins!<br/><br/>With the Horror cards and game mechanics, there are a lot of fun strategies to keep the fast-paced action going, but there still remains a luck element as well to help give less experienced players a fighting chance against players who are more familiar with game possibilities.<br/><br/>The Deluxe version is basically a whole new game drawing inspiration from the original, but re-implementing the system with new cards, new card types, new turn style and play mechanics, and updated card looks and text.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The 900 questions fall into six science categories: Life, Earth, Physics, Technology, Science &amp; Society, and Random Access (anything goes). Players can use Brain Boost and Cross Current spaces to take strategic shortcuts. Plus, they can even bet on their opponent's science knowledge by taking an Einstein's Gamble.&quot;<br/><br/>Game includes Big Brain Game Board, 4 playing pieces, 200 True/False cards, 100 Genius cards, 1 die, and Rule Booklet which includes a brief glossary of science terms.<br/><br/>A joint effort by Aristoplay and WGBH-Boston Educational Foundation, producers of NOVA.<br/><br/>",

These battles are... Trautenau, Soor, Nachod, Skalitz, and Gitschin.<br/><br/>This game uses the same system as War of the States: Gettysburg, 1863 and War of the States: Chickamauga & Chattanooga which is similar to the Rome at War and Eagles Of The Empire series as well. In this game, the units are Prussian, Austrian, and Saxon infantry brigades artillery batteries, and cavalry regiments.  The pieces are moved around topographic maps of the various battlegrounds.   Combat is resolved using by rolling a number of dice equal to the total combat strength of units involved in combat, with hits scored on a result of 6.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Hollow Trail, you become pilgrims on the long-for-gotten road to salvation. Your goal is to place cards controlled by you (servants)on selected locations and gain points. But the trail vanishes in your steps, so it&acute;s up to you, if you&acute;re willing to sacrifice your servants by placing them on those doomed places.<br/><br/>There are 4 actions in player&acute;s turn: <br/><br/>     Send - You&rsquo;ll start every turn with 5 Minions in your hand. When you take a Send action, choose one of them and place it below the leftmost card of the trail. Mark it with a token in your color.<br/>     Travel - With a Travel action, you advance one Minion along the trail to the right. Your Minion can take a number of steps indicated by its speed <br/>     Fight - With a Fight action, you can attempt to slay or turn an opponent&rsquo;s Minion. Choose one of your Minions at that same location. Your Minion is the attacker and your opponent&rsquo;s Minion is the defender. Specify whether you will fight with strength or willpower.<br/>     Conjure - Each location along the Hollow Trail holds magical power that can be unleashed by those who know its secrets. To take a Conjure action, your Minion and its location must have a matching type. This type determines the type of spell you can Conjure.<br/><br/><br/>Contests<br/>Hollow trail is a positional game. To score, you need to send your Minions to a particular location. The locations that allow players to compete for points are called Contests. The Contests are not resolved until the scoring phase (every 4 rounds) so it&rsquo;s not enough to gain the dominant position &ndash; you must hold it.<br/><br/>Scoring phase<br/>After each set of 4 rounds, there is a scoring phase, as indicated by the timing track along the top of the scoreboard. The following things happen in this order:<br/>1. Guardians attack. Resolve Guardians from left to right.<br/>In the example below, the Guardian attacks the location to its left, turning the red Minion into a Lost Minion.<br/>2. Score locations from left to right. <br/>In the example below, the red and blue players are tied at the first location, so each gets 2 points. No one gets points at the second location. The red player could have scored 5 points at the third location, but red&rsquo;s Minion was turned, so no one scores. Both players at the Campsite score 1 point.<br/>3. Old trail vanishes! Remove the first three locations and all Minions there. Cards go to their respective discard piles. Slide all remaining cards left.<br/>4. If any of the remaining locations is still face down, turn it face up. Guardians revealed this way do not attack, but give Guardians and Obstacles their resistance tokens and replacement-option cards, as usual.<br/>5. New trail appears. Shuffle the deck corresponding to the next part of the game and deal out 3 new locations face down.<br/> At the ends of part I and part II, the first three locations in the trail are removed. The Minions at those locations have a chance to glean magical essence for their players, but they don&rsquo;t survive to the next part of the game. In general, it&rsquo;s a good idea to get at least one Minion to the second half of the trail so you aren&rsquo;t starting the next part of the game with nothing.<br/>6. The leftmost card of the trail must not be an Obstacle or a Guardian. If it is, replace it with a random Contest from the same deck.<br/>7. All players may now discard any number of Minions from their hands and draw back to a full hand of 5. In this case, all cards must be drawn randomly from the deck.<br/>8. Advance the round counter and determine a new starting player. The player in the worst position gets to go last. This means the starting player is the player to the left of the one with the fewest points. If players are tied for fewest points, the one with fewer Minions is worse off. If there is still a tie, break it randomly.<br/><br/>",

A player can win if all other bosses are eliminated or by occupying one side of the board and playing the appropriate card related to that side.<br/><br/>Players have the option of either moving or cashing money:<br/><br/>Pieces can move on foot or up to four can move faster by car. When either one of the gang is on a &quot;Take a card&quot; space, follow that instruction. Cards can be good, or not really, at times. When stopping at a space occupied by rivals, a shootout occurs. A six sided die (two blank sides, two times one and two times two) is rolled until only one gang is present in the square. Players eliminate whatever they roll, a blank being a miss.<br/><br/>After placing the boss on the board all gang members and cars have to be purchased.

Most money is made when a gang succeeds in smuggling a barrel of alcohol from the owned brewery to one of the bars.<br/>Controlling the police comes in handy as well.<br/><br/>The board consists of a grid with streets and blocks divided in a North, East, South and West side.<br/>The gangs come in six colors.

When your family visits a space corresponding to an interest they have, your family gets happier. :) Every time you travel on the road, it's boring and your family loses happiness. :( While trying to make your family happy, you might also want to visit bonus attractions (such as the Statue of Liberty and the Golden Gate Bridge). Once a space has been visited, it is no longer available to other players. Some spaces require the drawing of a card, which can be good or bad. Maybe your family will stop for a snack, or perhaps someone will have to visit the bathroom &ndash; right now!<br/><br/>In addition to your car, each family has one Plane Ticket which allows quick travel between any two airports. Just make sure you plan for the long drive home!<br/><br/>Once your family has had a good vacation and you are satisfied with their level of happiness, you can head home and lock in your score. Players may head home at any time as long as they have visited at least one of their target destinations. Once one player has gone home, a countdown begins; all other players have seven turns to make it home. Players who are home score bonus points while they wait for the last few turns to wind down. In the end, you'll compare notes &ndash; that is, scores &ndash; and see how your vacation stacks up against everyone else's. Who has bragging rights for this year?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Kickstarter Page<br/><br/>Morphology Junior takes all the fun of the &quot;original&quot; game and adapts it to younger players (target age: 8+.) In order to move their frog-pieces from the &quot;Start&quot; lilypad to the &quot;Finish,&quot; Morphologists must put on their creative thinking-caps to build words like &quot;bike&quot; and &quot;snow&quot; using the 35+ game pieces provided (see below for details). The game mixes some &quot;original&quot; Morphology rules like &quot;Everybody Play&quot; and &quot;Pick 5&quot; with some new adaptations, including &quot;Morph&quot; (where the Morphologist becomes a piece in the game) and &quot;Ribbit, Ribbit&quot; (where the Morphologist can make noises to help his/her teammates guess the right word).<br/><br/>....<br/><br/>In Morphology Junior, players form into up to 4 teams.  Each team gets a delightful plastic team frog marker to mark their place along the lilypad themed game board.<br/><br/>After deciding if the players will use the easy or hard sides of the clue cards (or perhaps kids use easy and adults use hard?) the first team to play chooses their first Morphologist who will create the word on the card from a collection of bits including colored cubes, a black string, glass baubles, wooden planks and little wooden 'people'.<br/><br/>In basic play, the Morphologist is a puppeteer and cannot spell out words or symbols, make any sounds other than a small amount of grunting and encouraging for guess feedback, and cannot interact directly with the pieces.  The rulebook gives the example of 'toothbrush' and how the Morphologist can't pretend to brush their own teeth but they can brush the teeth of the little wooden figure.<br/><br/>Some of the lily pad spaces can change this though.  Everyone Plays allows both teams to guess what the current Morphologist is building.  Interception allows an opposing team to guess if the current team doesn't guess correctly by the time the timer runs down. Morph! allows the Morphologist to be a piece as well, so go ahead and brush YOUR teeth!  Pick 5 forces the Morphologist to choose just 5 props to use after looking at the word. Pick 5 + 1 however allows the opposing teams to choose the 5 props and the Morphologist gets to add just one more prop after reading the word.  And finally there is Ribbit! Ribbit! where the Morphologist can make noises!<br/><br/>Correct guesses allow a team to move their frog to the next lily pad.  First team to get their frog to the final lily pad wins!<br/><br/>",

They want to lure snakes for their own internal satisfaction &ndash; well, that and the ability to win the game. To call the snake forward, they must properly guess the color of the snakes through good memory and the right questions. Whoever attracts the most snakes wins the game.<br/><br/>The game is played with twenty cardboard snakes. Each snake has three coloured rings (separated by black rings). At the beginning of the game, each player receives three snakes, which they hide behind their player screen (the bush), with the snakes' heads sticking out underneath the screen.<br/><br/>Now, in turn, the players get to ask one other player for a color. That player then has to respond based on the snakes behind the screen:<br/><br/>     If the player has one or more snakes whose first coloured ring behind the screen has that color, the player responds with &quot;Yes!&quot; and pushes those snakes forward from under the screen, so that the coloured ring becomes visible to the other players. The asking player may now ask another question.<br/>     If that is not the case, but one or more snakes do have a ring of that color that is further behind the screen, the player responds with &quot;Later!&quot;<br/>     If no snakes have a ring of that color, the player responds with &quot;Bad luck!&quot;<br/><br/><br/>If a snake is completely pushed out from under the screen, then the asking player gets the snake, and the player whose snake was pushed out takes a new snake from the supply and places it behind the screen. In this case, the asking player's turn ends.<br/><br/>Twice during the game, a player can use a magical flute, which allows them to direct a question for a color to all other players instead of just one.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the snakes have been lured from the bushes. The player who has collected the most snakes wins.<br/><br/>",

This villa then has a light placed inside it before a roof is added. Each round, a player is challenged to place two characters into the center of the villa. This player moves two of the wands so that the characters inside the villa are pushed forward; she then peeks through a peephole to see whether she's correct, and if so, she gains a scoring token after other players get to verify the characters. After a player collects her third token, finish the round so that everyone has the same number of turns. Whoever has three tokens wins!<br/><br/>Gruselrunde zur Geisterstunde includes a variant in which each round the active player is challenged to place three characters in the center of the villa (instead of two), and opponents guess whether or not this player was correct. After the active player pushes in the character wands, each opponent secretly places either a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; token in hand, then they reveal them simultaneously. If the active player was right, she gains two scoring tokens while each opponent who guessed &quot;yes&quot; earns one; if she's wrong, then each opponent who guessed &quot;no&quot; earns one token. The winning threshold in this variant is 8-10 tokens, depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Components of &quot;Gold Robbery in London&quot; include 1 game board, 37 sector cards, 12 tip cards, 1 search block, 6 wooden pawns and 1 marker.  The game seems based on the work of Edgar Wallace (1875&ndash;1932), author of more than 150 detective and adventure novels. The numbers on the hexagonal board correspond to those on the sector cards. Tip cards either say &quot;false tip&quot; or &quot;gold bar&quot;. Each player receives a copy of the police gazette, one of each of the two types of tip cards and three sector cards.<br/>Each player tries to find out what cards the other players have. Landing on a space, the player asks and if players have the corresponding cards, they show the positive tip card, otherwise they show the negative card.  Each player also gets to find out what the player to their right showed. When someone feels they have located the exact place where gold has been hidden, he can interrupt the game and see if he is right.  If correct, he gets a huge bonus, but if wrong takes a major hit to his score.<br/><br/>2 years later described in Reinhold Wittig's SPIELECOLLECTION No. 1 Spiele zur Schatzinsel (1988) as &quot;Versteckt und Entdeckt&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Your curiosity leads you to dig in the sand with your hands, and you discover a golden coin and parts of a map that you piece together. What if the map leads to Captain Willain Kidd's fabulous treasure...<br/><br/>In Skeleton Island, players try to piece together treasure maps and find gold coins by digging in the &quot;sand&quot; &ndash; more specifically, by digging in the sand-decorated cards. To set up the game, someone takes the deck of 49 sand cards, splits them in half, turns one half face-down, shuffles the two halves together, then swishes the combined deck around on the table to make a pile of sand.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player takes either a standard turn or a piracy turn. In a standard turn, the player takes one &quot;free&quot; card &ndash; that is, a card not covered at all by any other card &ndash; and looks at it. The player can keep the card, or return it to the edge of the sand pile and draw a second card, which she must keep. (If only one or two cards are free, the player can close her eyes and blow on the pile to spread the sand.)<br/><br/>Players are searching for gold coins, which are valuable on their own, or halves and quarters of a treasure map. The first player to hand in a complete map of one of the five colors collects the island card of this color, which is worth five coins.<br/><br/>On a piracy turn, the player removes any three cards she's collected from the game, then either takes two consecutive standard turns or swipes any card from an opposing player.<br/><br/>When all the islands have been claimed or all the sand cards removed, the game ends and the player with the most coins wins.<br/><br/>",

If you like Scrabble, Word Feud and Bananagrams, you'll love Word Fight: The <br/>word game without any downtime.<br/><br/>Word Fight takes it to the next level. All players play at the same time. Through three rounds of 5 minutes, it becomes more challenging. The loser will guaranteed call for a rematch. And that takes no longer than 15 minutes!<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Each player receives their own 9x5 squared board, and an extra space for 7 private tiles. In the middle of the table, all the letter tiles are placed face down. When the 5 minute timer is started, all players reveal their own 7 tiles, and can play these on their own board. They can make words as they want, using the same rules as in Scrabble. Letters already placed may not be rearranged. When there is room for letters on their board, new tiles may be drawn from the face down pile in the middle, or other players discard pile. Players may discard unused tiles face up, snd others may take these as needed.<br/><br/>When the time is up, all players count their used letters. 1 point for each placed letter, 5 points for 5-letter words, 10 for 7-letters and 20 for 9-letter words. For each letter in an invalid word, -5 points.<br/><br/>This goes on for 3 rounds. The second round adds a challenge. 4 face down tiles are placed on each players boards, decided by the player with the least points. They are blocked. The third round, these tiles are turned face up, and must stay where they are.<br/><br/>The winner after 3 rounds is the one with the most points in total.<br/><br/>",

So the player who possesses the most stolen treasures at the end wins. Be careful, however: some safes are secured with an alarm system. And this barking, vicious alarm system is called Bodo Boxo!<br/><br/>The game contains 110 cards, consisting of 80 treasure cards, 20 safe cards and 10 plus/minus cards.<br/><br/>From the 20 safe cards, 15 cards show on the back the picture &quot;Boxo Asleep Break-in Succeeded&quot; and 5 cards show the picture &quot;Boxo Awake Pants Torn.&quot;<br/><br/>The 10 plus/minus cards are not played. They are used only to keep plus and minus scores separated.<br/><br/>Each player gets all  treasure cards of a color. The player then shuffles his treasure cards and puts them in a facedown stack on the table.   Now each player uses the  4 safe cards: 3 with the picture &quot;Boxo Asleep Break-in Succeeded&quot; and 1 with the picture &quot;Boxo Awake Pants Torn.&quot; to put his treasures in the safes. Players turn over the top 4 treasure cards from their stacks and put them in the middle of the table, side by side so that all players can see their values. Each player covers his 4 face-up treasure cards with a safe card, with the safe picture face up, but with the values of the treasure cards still visible. One of the safe cards is &quot;hot,&quot; because it shows Bodo Boxo with a scrap of pants on the back. Each player decides which of his 4 treasure cards will get the &quot;hot&quot; safe card. The players cannot tell which of their opponents? treasure cards is &quot;hot,&quot; since all safe cards look the same from the front. The first player then tries to break in to a safe. If the card from the safe shows BOXO ASLEEP then the  BREAK-IN SUCCEEDED and the player takes the stolen treasure card and puts it facedown under his plus card. If the card shows that BOXO is AWAKE  then the Boxo bites the player tearing his pants so the player gets caught and the value of the card from that safe is deducted from his score.  The alarm has startled Lord Schlotterderry. He immediately attends to the remaining safes. The robbed player immediately puts all his treasure cards that are still in safes under his plus card! Now, the next player going clockwise takes a turn. If a player is not able to plunder because he is the only one with unopened safes, he must forfeit his turn.  Play continues with each player taking his turn.<br/><br/>Each player then  replenishes his safes for another round. The game continues until 4 rounds of safe cracking are finished when each player adds up the values of his collected treasure cards. The plus points are added and the minus points are subtracted. Whoever has the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>Play 4 rounds are played. In each round, the safes are first filled with treasures, which one can plunder as long as he dares.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Their names are virtually synonymous with the long conflicts with the native indigenes of the American West.  Cochise, Victoria, Chato, Geronimo.  These great war band leaders all come from the various tribes of the Apache, and the Apache Wars dominated the attention of the US government in its westward development for the critical 25 years from the American Civil War to the final capitulation of the natives of the area.<br/><br/>What the Game Looks Like:<br/><br/>Once We Moved Like the Wind covers these central conflicts of the American South West.  The game is played as a series of turns, each of which follows a sequence of play that begins with determining how bad a provocation results in conflict for the turn.  The provocation level determines the forces each player will have for the turn and their general placement on the map.  Next the Apache player moves the Apache forces and then the Army Player moves the US and Mexican forces.  Combat may then occur between opposing player forces that share a location.  After any combat is resolved, victory points are counted up and the player with the most for the turn earns one increase in victory level on the Victory Track.  Play then repeats for the next turn to the end of the game when the player with the higher level on the Victory track is the winner.<br/><br/>Central to the game is that the playing pieces are all wooden blocks with the information about each particular piece only on one side and hence hidden during play from the opposing player until action occurs which must reveal particular blocks.  And not all of these blocks are actually opposing forces.  For the Apache player in particular, many playing pieces each turn will represent rumors of Apache actions and forces which the Army player must chase down to determine if they are real or false.  Similarly, for the Apache player, not knowing which Army pieces represent which forces means not knowing if an opposing group is small enough to attack and win, or is in reality a force big enough to hand out a devastating defeat.<br/><br/>Once We Moved Like the Wind is played on a 22&rdquo;x 22&rdquo; mounted game board with a scale of about 14 kilometers per centimeter or 22 miles per inch.  The terrain represented is divided by a number of features.  Overall the area is divided into 4 large Territories: the Arizona Territory &amp; the New Mexico Territory in the US and the Sonora Territory &amp; the Chihuahua Territory in Mexico.  Dividing up all of the Territories, and often crossing their borders, are the Areas.  These represent sections of land of differing types between which the players move their forces.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>    &bull; Complexity: 3 out of 10<br/>    &bull; Solitaire Suitability: 5 out of 10<br/>    &bull; Time Scale: 3-4 years per turn<br/>    &bull; Map Scale: Areas covering parts of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Sonora and Chihuahua<br/>    &bull; Unit Scale: A wooden block represents an Army Troop or Apache War Band<br/>    &bull; Average Time to Play: &lt;2 Hours<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player is dealt thirteen cards.<br/><br/>The auction process is more simple than bridge. Each player counts the number of high card points he has (4 for an Ace, 3 for a King, 2 for a Queen and 1 for a Jack) and states the number of high card points. The partnership with the more high card points then has to play the hand. (If both partnerships have the same number of high card points, the hand is thrown in.) Of this partnership, the partner with the more high card points becomes the declarer. The partner with the fewer high card points becomes the dummy and lays out his hand. (If both partners have the same number of high card points, the one who states his high card point count first is the declarer.)<br/><br/>The declarer then looks at his partner's hand and decides what suit he wants to be trumps (if any), and whether to be in game or to take part score. In part score he must make 7 tricks, and in game he must make 6 tricks (assumed) plus 3 for no trumps, 4 for a major suit or 5 for a minor suit.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Trumps<br/><br/>         Partscore<br/><br/>         Game<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Clubs<br/><br/>         1<br/><br/>         5<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Diamonds<br/><br/>         1<br/><br/>         5<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Hearts<br/><br/>         1<br/><br/>         4<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Spades<br/><br/>         1<br/><br/>         4<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         No trumps<br/><br/>         1<br/><br/>         3<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The game then continues per bridge with 13 rounds of cards.<br/><br/>The scoring system is also simplified.<br/><br/>",

The Yeti wants to color up his white surroundings - fortunately, he discovers a color lab. <br/>The game consists of tiles which have two colors on one side and the color you get when you mix the two on the other. These tiles are laid out in a circle (2 color side up) and the Yeti is placed onto one of them. The players then take turns rolling a die. On a result of one, two or three the Yeti moves forward the respective number of tiles. Then the player has to say which color is on the other side of the tile. If wrong, nothing happens. If correct, the player takes a token of the color s/he named. If the result is a star, the player can place the Yeti onto any tile. The first player who gets three tokens of the same color or four all in all is the winner. <br/>Advanced rules suggest to flip the tiles around and let the kids name the two colors necessary to mix the color they see.<br/><br/>",

We established our makeshift colony on Charon and explored the region. We discovered the Royal Martian Federation (RMF), the Hielo, and the Myst; and made contact.<br/><br/>Although historical rivals, we worked together to survive the frigid conditions, stockpiling resources and launching probes across the Milky Way.<br/><br/>One probe returned compelling data from the Copernicus System in Quadrant 1. Coper has a yellow dwarf star and an intriguing group of planets. A dazzling radioactive element, that we named Vertium, was discovered. Our physicists think it could heat our colonies, and upgrade weapons and armour.<br/><br/>As word spread, the rebel groups bolted for Coper. The fragile cooperation evaporated. Each faction is now out for itself - claiming planets and mining Vertium. The stakes are clear: for whoever controls the Vertium will control Coper and perhaps the galaxy.<br/><br/>Brooks out.<br/><br/>VERTIUM is a quick and tactical space colonization game for 1 to 4 players. Players are faction Commanders directing their Captains to claim planets and mine the powerful radioactive element Vertium.<br/><br/>As influential moons orbit the colonized planets, additional Vertium is gained. However, you'll have to be wise and courageous, because your rivals have their eyes on your spheres and resources.<br/><br/>Prepare for conflict.<br/><br/><br/>         There are 2 expansions included as well as SOLO rules. ** <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Expansion #1 - NEW DISCOVERIES:<br/><br/>A new discovery has been made in Coper! Some planets contain a different radioactive element: Gelbon. Combined with Vertium, it powers a planetary weapons system named CUBE (Cubic U-Beam Emitter).<br/><br/>Expansion #2 - SHADOWS OF THE COMPLEX:<br/><br/>Through traitors and spies, the dreaded Complex has learned about the Vertium and tracked down the Rebels in Coper. The Complex has dispatched a squad of giant killer robots (aka the Titan) to eliminate their adversaries once and for all. To stand any chance of survival, the Rebel factions will have to lay aside their differences and work together.<br/><br/>",

Does the penguin get a nut and the squirrel get a fish? And in where exactly does the lion live?<br/><br/>A combination of memory and roll-and-move game. The players take turns in clockwise order. The player in turn rolls the die, and moves forward or backward. If he lands on a bucket symbol, het gains more food (if he has free hands - the meeples can only hold two bucktes each). At an enclosure door, he opens it (reveals the hidden animal), and feeds it if he has the right food (for example, meat for lion and crocodile). A wild symbol allows to move to any free space.<br/><br/>Game proceeds until one player manages to feed five animals, and is declared winner.<br/><br/>The rules contains a variant for childrens of age 3, with open enclosure doors (removing the memory aspect).<br/><br/>",

Unlike most games though, each player must form words and then scramble them in the hope that the opposition can&rsquo;t figure them out. The twist to Sabuca is that any player can stop the action at any moment when they think they have the goods!<br/><br/>Sabuca is a tricky little word game that is made all the more difficult by the time limit and ability for other players to end things before you are ready. This lends the game a frantic, tense feel and this is something that will likely be favored by the word smiths out there. The nature of trying to unscramble other player's words adds Sabuca a level of depth as it almost forms a game within a game.<br/><br/>",

The game requires a certain amount of strategic and tactical skill, combined with an ability to play the odds and to adjust your plans rapidly to a situation that can swiftly change if you don't have the numbers you need. Sometimes the dice will go against you and it becomes a<br/>case of simply trying to consolidate your men into a strong enough position to survive, sometimes they will go your way and allow you to do precisely what you want. In short, in this game you must learn to make do with what you have, and work with it to succeed.<br/><br/>The game is also particularly suited for variation, using new board layouts, playing with dominoes instead of dice, or many other possible variations.<br/><br/>The game is freely available to anyone who wants to play it and you are entirely free to make your own sets.<br/>Tied To A Kite Games make wooden sets, which will be released at the UK Games Expo 2009.<br/><br/>The rules and board may be downloaded from the publisher's website.

        "description": "1941: What If? An Alternative History Wargame of a Second Winter War is a low-to-intermediate complexity two-player alternative history wargame that&rsquo;s also easily adaptable to solitaire play. It allows you to investigate the parameters inherent in the situation in Central Eastern Europe, at the end of 1940, had the Bulgarians decided to ally with the Soviets instead of the Germans, which historically they considered doing. Long story short (see the support article elsewhere in this issue), the result would&rsquo;ve been the Second War&rsquo;s eastern front erupting half a year prior to its historic start date under both natural and manmade conditions vastly different than pertained at that later date.<br/><br/>Each hexagon on the map represents 45 miles (73 km) from side to opposite side. Each turn represents a half a month of &lsquo;real time.&rsquo; Each unit of maneuver represents an army or corps or ad hoc equivalent of those sizes of units.<br/><br/>The Soviet (a.k.a. &ldquo;Soviet/Allied&rdquo; or &ldquo;Allied&rdquo;) player commands all the Soviet units in the game along with those of Bulgaria, Greece and Britain. The German (a.k.a. &ldquo;German/Axis&rdquo; or &ldquo;Axis&rdquo;) player commands all the German units in the game, along with those of Turkey, Slovakia, Hungary, Romania and Italy. Yugoslavia starts the game neutral and out of play. Its government is leaning pro-Allied, however, and it will likely join the war on that side during the course of the game. When/if that occurs, the two Yugoslav-Croatian (4th and 7th) armies will either disintegrate, their soldiers dispersing to their homes, or join the Axis while the rest of the Yugoslav armed forces fight in the Allied side.<br/><br/>The orders of battle contain pretty all the units present in these armies at this time within this theater of operations. The Germans are only missing the non-mechanized corps they had garrisoning their western conquests. The Turks are minus the three corps they kept in their Caucasus and Syrian border areas. Similarly, the Soviets have everything they had available historically in the regions of the USSR lying west of the Urals, north of the Caucasus and south of the Arctic. Their reinforcements are based on what they put together during the first three months of the historic war in the east. Their Independent Coastal Army wasn&rsquo;t organized historically until soon after the start of Operation Barbarossa; however &ndash; given the geo-strategic circumstances of this might-have-been war and the fact the resources needed to organize it already existed at this time &ndash; it was only reasonable to include the ICA as a starting Soviet unit.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rozpr&aacute;vkari is a card game based on fairy tales created by Slovak writer an folclorist Pavol Dob&scaron;insk&yacute;. The game aims at sparking the interest in Slovak folklore and literature in younger generations by using various fairy tale references in form of a flavor text or illustrations on the playing cards. The game itself can be used as an amusing educational tool, as the scoring mechanism is supposed to make younger players practice basic mathemataical operations.<br/><br/>The game represents the fight between good and evil. The folklore villains decided to steal all the stories in which they have lost their fight. Players try to defeat these villains and rescue the stolen fairy tales. The goal is to collect all parts of as much fairy tales as possible, using 'wish' cards and 'doucat' tokens.<br/><br/>The game was crowdfunded in 2017.<br/><br/>",

The mesas (as well as Fort Apache and the Indian Camp) end a pieces move and cannot be jumped over.<br/><br/>To win you must capture your opponents flag. The playing pieces are miniature cavalry and Indians. The cavalry force comprises of 12 men and 3 Gatling guns and are placed in predetermined starting positions on the board. There is 1 cavalry captain that can move any number of squares in any one direction, 7 cavalry men that move like rooks in chess, 3 Gatling guns that move like a chess bishop and 4 guards that move like a chess king. The flag cannot move.<br/><br/>The Indian force mirrors their Cavalry opponents with 1 chief, 7 archers, 3 rifle men, 4 guards and 1 emblem.<br/><br/>The number of pieces a player can move in a turn is determined randomly by a spinner built into one of the mesas. Depending on the spin a player will be able to move either 3, 2, 1, or none of his pieces.<br/><br/>There are also two player aid cards that assist players in remembering how their pieces move. The rules are printed on the inside cover of the box lid and the box lid is also marked &quot;made in Japan&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Gamers have the choice of competing in a single race or the entire F1 championships playing on the different race tracks similar to the actual F1 Championship.<br/><br/>Each player (driver) has an identical deck of movement cards, which also represents their fuel, so if at any time during the game they run out of cards, they are out of the game!<br/><br/>Before the race, players are given 12 construction points to customize their cars according to how they think it will race best on the track selected (the basic game comes with 2 tracks - Malaysia &amp; Japan). Players can choose from better:<br/>- Acceleration (1 point).<br/>- Braking (1 point).<br/>- Cornering (2 points).<br/>- Special features (3 points).<br/><br/>The race is over 3 laps, and players begin with 5 cards from their deck, and 3 &quot;Event&quot; cards (which introduce elements such as rain, safety car, etc).<br/><br/>Each round, players starting with the race leader:<br/>1) Decide if he/she wishes to play an &quot;Event&quot; card. The effects take place immediately.<br/>2) Must play 1 &quot;Movement&quot; card and MAY play 1 other card (Acceleration, Braking, Cornering or Special).<br/>3) Players then move their cars according to the modified score of their cards.<br/><br/>As in real life, players have to really plan how to negotiate the corners, where penalty points in the form of tire wear is imposed if players pass the corners. Essentially, players who land on the corners receive no penalty.<br/><br/>Players also have to plan tactically when to make their pit stops, and whether they take a short one (just top up petrol), or a longer one (where they also change tires).<br/><br/>In the end, players who manage their resources well, take risks at the right time and plan their pit stops well will emerge the winner!<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s also ridiculously simple:<br/><br/>Can you say in an Italian accent &ldquo;We have ways of making you talk&rdquo;?<br/><br/>What is the answer to &ldquo;Quel est le nom du stade national de football anglais?&rdquo;<br/>Can you impersonate a children&rsquo;s television presenter in the style of a Dutch person.<br/><br/>And which is the German word for swimming trunks &ndash; Badehose; Schwimmelpanten; Unterwassertrunken <br/>Correct answers win country flags &ndash; the first player/team to collect all six, wins.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s as simple as that. Guaranteed to make you laugh out loud and sure to make any party go with a bang&hellip;&hellip;.or should that be with a boem, boum, bum, boma, paf or r&auml;tt.<br/>&quot;.<br/><br/>",

Each word laid out earns points based on the commonality of the letters used, with certain board spaces giving bonuses. But a word can only be played if it uses at least one already-played tile or adds to an already-played word. This leads to slightly tactical play, as potential words are rejected because they would give an opponent too much access to the better bonus spaces.<br/><br/>The perfect edition of Scrabble for the Book Lover! Bonus points are awarded with the use of any author name, book title, or literary character.<br/><br/>",

It puts the player in the role of one of the candidates , who will do anything to win this presidential election, including using various dirty tactics against his opponents. Luckily, the victims can use the newspapers they own to spread the truth and walk away clean.<br/><br/>Not everything has to be achieved by cheating. You can also win elections cleanly, working honestly, achieving an impeccable political career, performing marches and other activities.<br/><br/>Instructions: Every player has a hand of 5 cards, which he replenishes from the deck after every play. On his turn he will play one of the cards in his hand. Usually he will play them in his own tableaux in one of three piles, votes (orange), money (green) and influence (purple). The person with the most votes at the end of the game is the winner, but you will need money and influence to be able to play the cards with the most votes. Sadly, the cards representing the strongest money and influence have the whiff of corruption about them, and if an opponent sees corruption in your tableaux, he can use the press to strip you of said money/influence.<br/><br/>Game ends when all cards have been played.<br/><br/>",

Maybe Ronja Deer, Suri Dormouse, and the rest of the gang in the dense leafy undergrowth?<br/><br/>Discover Free Play and Details<br/>In Forest Friends your child can engage with the game materials during free play. Play along! Discover the pictures on the game materials together and talk to your child about them. Ask your child what they recognize and encourage them to name things. Talk to them about which animals they have already seen or heard in the forest. And just like that you're already role playing with your child.<br/><br/>Game 1: Little Forest Explorers<br/>One child gets Mia Mouse. Read out a task. The child searches for the solution. Sometimes the correct answer is visible on the outer walls, sometimes only through the peep holes. If the child can't find the correct answer, help them. Once the child has found the solution, they receive a star and place it in front of them. Mia Mouse is passed on to the next child. It's now their turn. The game is over once all 5 stars have been collected.<br/><br/>Game 2: Play Hide and Seek<br/>Before starting the game, everyone may look into any two holes. Every child tries to remember which animal is where. Whoever was last in a forest goes first and moves Mia Mouse one animal tile forward in a clockwise direction. The child names the animal that they see on the tile. Now it's time to think about which hole they can see the animal through. They choose the hole they think the animal is hiding in and look through it. If right, the child can take a star from the starry sky as a reward. The game ends when all the stars have been taken from the sky. The children now stack the stars they won on top of each other. The child with the highest star stack wins.<br/><br/>",

Victory points are sheep or gold.<br/>1 sheep is 1 point, 1 gold is also 1 point, but if 1 sheep is converted to gold, it will be doubled to 2 gold.<br/><br/>Set the order card and the villager card and put them out on the back.<br/>First, turn only the order cards into a table and arrange them so that the number on the left is small and the number on the right is large.<br/><br/>The rightmost villager in the row becomes a wolf.<br/>Villager cards other than wolf are turned face up.<br/>The number of society is written on the villager card, and if it is greater than or equal to the number of society on the left villager card and less than or equal to the number of society on the right villager card, the villager card is in the correct position.<br/>Villagers in the correct row will trigger effects based on their role.<br/>Some villagers have text effects even if they are not in the correct position.<br/>As a result, you can collect sheep that are victory points, convert sheep into gold, or steal other people's sheep.<br/><br/>To win the game, your villagers must be in the correct position in the line.<br/>It requires a high degree of reading on your part and a bit of luck.<br/>The reason is that you need to combine the order card in your hand and the three villager cards well.<br/>Aim for the front of the line, or for the back, or whether your plan will succeed... it's all up to you!<br/><br/>That said, it's basically an orthodox card game.<br/>It is almost impossible to get lost in the play itself!<br/>The slightly complicated rules and the short playing time of about 20 minutes will give you the joy of playing a dense game!<br/><br/>In addition, although it is basically an interpersonal battle with 4 to 5 people, it is fully equipped with rules for 1 to 3 people including automatons. Therefore, it is a game that is not easily influenced by the number of players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Run it in for 7, connect on a Hail Mary pass, or win the game on a last-second field goal in this fun, fast-paced, addictive card game.<br/><br/>​Jukem Football is the fun and competitive card game that makes every day a football day! Run, pass, and catch your way down the field, but be careful of your opponent's defensive cards that can wipe out your entire drive! Use your math skills, luck and strategy to defeat your opponent.<br/><br/>Setup: Choose a player to be the dealer. The dealer shuffles the deck, then deals four card face down to each player. The dealer places the remaining deck face down in the center of the play area to form the draw pile, then turns the top card face up beside the draw pile to start the discard pile. The other player takes the first turn and players then alternate turns.<br/><br/>On Your Turn: Replenish your hand to five cards. You can replenish from the draw pile and/or the discard pile, but you can only draw one card ( the top card) from the discard pile per turn.  Make one offensive play (if you can) each turn to build your scoring drive. Ann offensive play is either a RUN card or a PASS/CATCH card combination.  If no cards in your hand are playable, discard one card of your choice face up on the discard pile. This ends your turn.<br/><br/>Offensive Plays:  Build your drive by placing offensive cards face up in front of you in a line, from left to right.  The most common offensive plays are RUN plays, and PASS and CATCH combinations.  There are also some special offensive plays that will add yardage to your drive. You may play any RUN card face up in front of you on any turn to gain the number of yards shown on that card or play a PASS and CATCH combination cards. To make a PASS and CATCH play, first play a PASS card, then play a CATCH card showing any number of yards within that range.<br/><br/>Scoring a touchdown: To score a touchdown, you must have exactly 100 yards on your drive - no more, no less. Each touchdown immediately ends your drive and scores seven points.  As soon as you score a touchdown, stake all of your drive cards in a pile and set it aside to record your score.  This ends your turn. On your next turn you can begin a new drive.<br/><br/>Defensive Plays: On your opponent's turn, after your opponent made an offensive play, you may play a defensive card to slow down or even stop his/her drive.  These include Holding! Sack! these stop your opponents drive, while the Fumble and Picked off cards end your drive.<br/><br/>Half Time: If you draw the last card from the draw pile, you make as many plays as you can from your hand on that turn. After you've run out of plays, have been stopped by a defensive card, or have scored a field goal or touchdown, the half is over. Shuffle all the cards and play the second half the same way you played the first half.  The player who did not deal in the first half deals in the second half.<br/><br/>How to win: When the second half ends, the game is over. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie play again until a player scores either a field goal or a touchdown. That play wins the game!<br/><br/>",

Some are malevolent and others are mischievous, or occasionally a few of them even bring good fortune to those who encountered with them. The name of the game, Hyakki-Yagyo (百鬼夜行), meaning one hundred Yokais' night parade, is based on a popular style of lore where people get together and take turns to tell Yokai (or ghost) stories one by one. When the hundredth story is told, it was believed that a real Yokai is summoned and appears in front of the folks.<br/><br/>In this game, players are Yokai storytellers. But you tell your own Yokai stories by collecting different and beautiful Yokai cards and place them as separate sets based on their suits and numbers. In each round, each player take turns to draw from open Yokai cards into their hands and place a set of cards (for example, four cards in sequence with the same suit, three cards of the same number with different suits, etc.) Each set of cards represents different ghost stories. A game goes until one of the players score 10 points in total by repeating rounds, just like Yokai stories goes on and on all through the night...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>The Blue &amp; Gray classics are being updated with a slight change in scale to 352 yards per hex, an updated game system that treats unit differences more accurately, and a combat system that includes step losses.<br/><br/>The Union Army of the Cumberland had been pursing the Confederate Army of the Tennessee after the Battle of Perryville, in October 1862. Throughout November the Confederate commander, Braxton Bragg, had misinterpreted that pursuit as an effort to capture Chattanooga; so now he halted and deployed his troops northwest of Murfreesboro, Tennessee, so as to safeguard the road junction there. Thus the Confederates sat and awaited their pursuers for a month. When the Federal army arrived in late December 1862, the Confederates launched a surprise attack near Stones River.<br/><br/>Stones River utilizes the all-new Musket &amp; Saber Combat System, which presents a simple yet accurate portrayal of warfare during the American Civil War. The combat system is intuitive, including all the details that characterized battle during the Civil War while also simulating the unique aspects of 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, and reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure a line of retreat.<br/><br/>In Stones River a new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of the rifled musket. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle, and supply lines require players to protect their logistical trains. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.<br/><br/>",

The roller knocks down up to five milk bottles and each player gets to move a number of spaces equal to the number of fallen bottles which match their card.<br/><br/>",

However it is also necessary to stake your answer at the right time.<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds of five questions. All players bet money in each round. The player that can give the most correct answers and at the same time dares to stake it all the way will win the pot. The players are only aware of how many questions they have answered correctly themselves which means bluffing is a critical part of the game. Players can also use action chits to gain advantages over their opponents which lends the game an extra level of strategy.<br/><br/>In spite of the game's English title it is only available in Swedish.<br/><br/>The game was nominated to &Aring;rets spel 2009 (Game of the year 2009 in Sweden).<br/><br/>",

Repeating a thing already named means you are out. The reader is final arbiter of disputes.<br/><br/>The device has a color for each player and once the reader presses the start button, it randomly flashes a color (lighting up their light and playing tense, accelerating music). That player has a few seconds to name something from the chosen category. The time shortens as play progresses. If the player can't name something before the timer flashes the next light that player is out. Once someone is out they press their assigned button and the timer stops.

You have a day to harvest all you will need while trying to stop the mischievous Keiju from causing havok in your Garden.<br/><br/>If you can find the right combination of flowers and herbs to satisfy them, they will consider you a friend and move elsewhere.<br/><br/>To Win: <br/>The goal of the game is to harvest all but one of the Nature cards from the Garden and entice all the Keiju to leave.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/>Shuffle the deck of 8 Keiju cards and draw 4 of them. Remove the others from the game. Place these 4 drawn Keiju on top of the pile of 44 Nature cards and shuffle this deck of cards and lay them out face up in 4 rows of 12 cards each This area is the Garden.<br/><br/>Leave room for 5 cards below these rows. This area is the Basket.<br/><br/>You will also create a discard pile - the Harvest - during the game.<br/><br/>To Play:<br/>You may choose one of any two matching cards from any of the rows if your choice is: two adjacent cards within the rows, sharing the same suit or number OR if there are exactly two other adjacent Nature cards between the pair you are choosing to remove one of (Note: A Keiju card may not be one of these in between cards).<br/><br/>Only one of these two cards is chosen and is then placed either in the Harvest or the Basket. Each time you remove a card from a row, slide any cards to the right or left of the removed card to fill in any gaps across the rows. Cards are moved from the bottom rows upward or the top row downwards as a gap is filled.<br/><br/>The Harvest - This is a discard pile, you will receive one point for each card in this pile at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The Basket - Instead of placing cards in the Harvest you may place a card instead in one of 5 card &lsquo;piles&rsquo; in your Basket. Cards in your Basket are used to entice the Keiju in your Garden to leave.<br/><br/>Keiju must be removed in numerical order, lowest to highest. If, at any time, cards on top of the piles in the Basket match a request as shown on the next consectuive numbered Keiju card in the Garden, you may remove that Keiju to the Harvest where it is worth 10 points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The four or five cards used to bribe the Keiju are then removed from the game and will not score any points. Keiju do not have suits. They will form blocked areas in the rows of cards which can affect how you remove the suited cards.<br/><br/>As you play cards to the Basket you will cover up previous cards played there, which can then only be revealed once they are used to entice Keiju.<br/><br/>Scoring:<br/>At game end you will receive:<br/><br/>1 point per Nature card in the Harvest.<br/>10 points per Keiju in the Harvest.<br/>Any Keiju left in the Garden are -5 points each.<br/>Any Nature cards left in the Garden are -1 point each.<br/>Cards remaining in the Basket count neither for nor against you.<br/><br/>This game can be played with a traditional card deck.<br/><br/>",

You will need to find the dreaded Portal of Corialus to defeat one of the many bosses included in the box. To do so, you move tile by tile, facing many obstacles, traps, and enemies and you use your cards to attack, defend, assist your allies and try to pass as many trials as you can. You must be fast: each turn, the enemy Menace might increase... and when it reaches 20 the game is over! Try not to do it too fast, though: being too tired makes you vulnerable, and even one fallen hero will mark the end of your adventure.<br/><br/>May the Raven King be with you!<br/><br/><br/>Dal tavolo alla Rete e ritorno! Luxastra ha finalmente il suo gioco in scatola, l&rsquo;apice di una lunga collaborazione tra InnTale e Fant&agrave;sia Edizioni, firmato dall&rsquo;autore emergente Gianluca Horton, e in esclusiva assoluta.<br/><br/>Un&rsquo;esperienza semplice ma coinvolgente, giocabile in solitaria o in gruppi da due a sei giocatori, dove ciascun partecipante pu&ograve; diventare un vero eroe. Scegliete tra i sei Personaggi Giocanti della Prima Serie di Luxastra: ognuno di loro ha la sua plancia, i suoi poteri, il suo mazzo, e tutti quanti sono assolutamente unici ed iconici.<br/><br/>Usate le vostre carte per attaccare, difendervi, curare i vostri alleati e volgere i combattimenti a vostro favore. Ma non dimenticate che le vostre forze non sono infinite, e che restare senza energie durante il combattimento potrebbe rendervi la vita difficile, visto che non potete fermarvi.<br/><br/>Ad ogni turno, dovrete cercare di farvi strada per la citt&agrave; Fatumastra, sempre di corsa tra le sue vie labirintiche. Tra vicoli ciechi, orde di nemici sul piede di guerra, artefatti nascosti nei luoghi pi&ugrave; imprevedibili, mentre la Minaccia continua a crescere e la mano invisibile del Fato cala su di voi.<br/><br/>Non c&rsquo;&egrave; tempo da perdere! Perch&eacute; una volta che la Minaccia raggiunger&agrave; il valore massimo, il destino di tutta Delphes sar&agrave; segnato, e voi non potete permetterlo. Radunate i vostri amici, sedetevi al tavolo da gioco e accettate la sfida.<br/><br/>Che il Re Corvo vegli su di voi.<br/><br/>",

A win is worth three points, a draw worth one point and loss gets you nothing. At the end of the league, the player with the most points will be crowned as the champion.<br/><br/>In a match, both players will put forward a squad of four of their players from each of the positions. With three attacks each, it's up to each player to pass, punt, dribble, cross and ultimately shoot or head the ball past the opposing player's goalkeeper with their attacker, decided by stat-to-stat comparisons aided by the roll of six-sided die. Win the clash to move the ball forward, but lose and your attack will be ended by a block, tackle or save and the ball given to the other player.<br/><br/>Outside of matches, pick up event cards to alter the landscape of the game both inside and outside of matches - sometimes in your favour, sometimes not - and patch up weaknesses in your team makeup by transferring new players in.<br/><br/>Beware, to finish at the top of the league it'll take talent and luck!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Rest is the phase for knights to stay and prepare their equipment and supplies, while Patrol is the phase to gather everything you need in the kingdom, or go to castle to get reward from the King. The most important phase is Promote, which symbolized your conquering of the trials and earn yourself knight virtues to elevate in the knight rank. Whenever a knight being promoted, there will be extra bonus for him to manifest the nobility. The game ends when any player collects the designated number of knight virtues, and the one with most virtues wins this game.<br/><br/>",

The players can&rsquo;t use bidding cards they&rsquo;ve placed as bets before, so they have to plan carefully which cards they should keep and which ones they are ready to sacrifice to get the full hand back.

        "description": "As the Saxons, you command this crucial battle for control of your land! You fight off the relentless Norman attacks as they seek the victory that would begin centuries of French-speaking kings and nobles controlling all of England.<br/><br/>Two players battle each other by aligning their cards that represent their units into battle columns. Your choice of battle formations will decide who wins the field that day. The Saxon player's army is led by Harold Godwinson (King Harold II). While the Norman's army is led by William of Normandy, later known as William the Conqueror because he was lucky enough to survive and win the battle. Will you be so lucky?<br/><br/>The object of the game is to force the enemy to flee or wipe them out.<br/><br/>This game uses a &ldquo;virtual board&rdquo;. Two &ldquo;sides&rdquo; of the board are supplied, which helps players visualize the central area of the board where the game actually takes place. The players&rsquo; troops (cards) outline the shape of the board.<br/><br/>The battle takes place on a grid divided into six columns and seven rows. The rows are shown on the &ldquo;side&rdquo; pieces.<br/><br/>The battlefield for each side has 3 opposing sectors and each sector has two columns. You win by breaking two opposing sectors.<br/><br/>If all break in the same player&rsquo;s turn, Saxons win! You gain a &ldquo;Major victory&rdquo; if you also kill the opposing leader and yours is alive. It is a &ldquo;Minor victory&rdquo; if your leader is dead, or if both leaders survive.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/>Box<br/>Rules<br/>1 Die<br/>16 wooden cubes <br/>2 Game Board Sides <br/>2 Leader Pawns<br/>55 Cards broken down as follows:<br/>20 Saxon Unit Cards representing Housecarles, Thegns, and Fyrds.<br/>20 Norman Unit Cards representing Cavalry, Archers, and Infantry <br/>15 Battle Event Cards<br/><br/>Complexity: 2 of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 2 of 10<br/>Playing Time: 30 minutes<br/>Players: 2<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Takayama is a dexterity game to play alone or with unlimited players. The goal is to build the highest mountains by stacking the various pieces of wood, measuring them and summing these measurements to reach 100 cm. The first player to reach 100 cm or more wins.<br/><br/>Each player builds his mountain during turn by turn. The smallest player starts. In front of him, he places the base of the mountain (wooden board) and the tokens with the symbols facing down. He randomly turns a first token, takes the piece of wood with the corresponding symbol and places it on the wooden base. The player has the right to place it on the position he chooses, but only on the edge ! This is the first part of the mountain.<br/> Next, he turns a second token, places once again the corresponding piece of wood on the previous piece and continues to build his mountain. The player may, at any time, decide to continue or interrupt his construction. If the player is satisfied with his mountain, he stops, measures its height and writes down the score. The next player can start. If, on the other hand, the player continues and his construction collapses, his score will be zero for that round and the turn of the next player begins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;200 Years of Hot Air Balloons&quot; commemorates the bicentennial of the 1783 first balloon ascent by the Montgolfier brothers.<br/><br/>The board is circular and divided into ten concentric rings. Twenty-four &quot;spokes&quot; combine with them to form a grid. Players each have a wooden balloon which shows its altitude by stacking it up, insecurely it seems, on small wooden disks. They also receive at start four ascent cards and four descent (gas bottle) cards. A wooden arrow on a disk at the center shows the current wind direction.<br/><br/>Players move by rolling two dice, a special one which describes a change in wind direction or a requirement on the player and an ordinary one which gives the amount to move. There are actually three games in one, all centered around getting a balloon to a specific location, the first two based on real life balloonist games: a chase or &quot;fox hunt&quot; and a target race. The third scenario describes a race to the center of the board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game of yacht racing, and an interesting precursor to 3M's Regatta. Sail Away was possibly designed by Howard J. Mullin as he is listed as the copyright holder on the game board.<br/><br/>Sail Away is played on a board resembling a nautical chart overlaid by a square grid. The game includes six metal yachts numbered 1 through 6. The yachts lean to one side or the other according to their tack. The yachts are moved across the map using the intersections of the grid lines.<br/><br/>Movement is governed by a spinner which has an inner and outer circle of results - one circle for the upwind leg, and the other circle for the downwind and crosswind legs. In addition to the bit of luck injected by the spinner (reflecting the vagaries of the wind), there is also a slight chance for misfortune - two small spaces on the spinner allow for a player to lose a turn for having a man overboard and two turns for capsizing. The rules also cover blanketing effects by windward yachts toward leeward yachts, tacking, and jibing.<br/><br/>The course is somewhat fixed in that the wind direction is always the same (southeast) and there are three course markers designated on the map. However, there are four different courses that may be run: counterclockwise around the triangular course described by the three markers, clockwise around the triangular course, around course marker 2 and back, or around course marker 3 and back. In addition, players may choose to race one lap or multiple laps.<br/><br/>",
