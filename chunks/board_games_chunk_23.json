They vary in depth (three levels) and productivity (zero, small, medium and large deposits).  Deeper deposits require bigger drilling rigs; the more expensive rig can go all the way down but could also be used in a shallower plot.<br/><br/>The players can explore up to three plots per turn, and can open bidding on up to three plots per turn as well.  Once purchased, a plot may be put into production by buying a rig for it or moving a rig (which costs money) from another plot --there is a limited number of rigs overall.<br/><br/>Production is affected by weather (weather cards in a winter/spring/summer/fall cycle); the northern plots are more likely to be shut down by bad weather.  Weather causes no production, half production or full production.<br/><br/>Next, there are the fluctuations in the price of oil.  Most of the time it is 4 $/bbl, but it can occasionally rise to 20 $/bbl.<br/><br/>Finally, the party in power changes every turn and sets three rates: the interest rate on your debt (you have no money at all at the game outset and must borrow; roughly 5% to 20%), the tax rate on your income (zero to 75%!) and the tax rate on sales (moving rigs, selling rigs and plots to the bank or other players; also zero to 75%).  You know which party is coming next turn, which does give you a rough idea of what to expect.  A couple of the party cards cause nationalisation, which is bad news for you.<br/><br/>First player to net $5 Million wins.<br/><br/>",

Turn in matching clue cards at the corresponding location to rescue the president or his important tape. To escape, you still need to find a glider or a map to the mine fields.<br/><br/>Fans of the movie will enjoy the chance to encounter Slag, Brain, Cabbie, Maggie, the Duke, and Romero with the opporutnity to gain them as allies during the game.

A play round consists of the two phases &quot;army buildup&quot; and &quot;movements and fighting&quot;. In the army phase the players receive new army and hero cards as well as useful action cards. Then, each player in turn moves their units to adjacent spaces.  If enemy units are on the space they do battle.  If you win, you gain points and can continue the battle.  If you lose, the next player continues the fight.  Play ends if the player armies can breach the Black Gate which gives the most points.   Alternatively, the players win if Frodo and SAM reach the last field of the mount doom. But if Gollum gets there before SAM and Frodo, all players lose.<br/><br/>Like the previous 2 big box games in this series, it will likely be released only in Germany.<br/><br/>",

They then attempt to mislead the greatest number of other players, who are cloud hunters, in an effort to gain points. To do this, after choosing a card, the visionary makes up a story of at most five words, then splays the cards on the table, and the cloud hunters in turn attempt to guess the visionary's chosen cloud. If the hunters choose a card that's not correct, the chosen card is given to the visionary, and play passes to the next hunter. If the chosen card is correct, the visionary earns points for every card they've already gathered.<br/><br/>After a set amount of turns, where each player gets a chance to be a visionary, play concludes, and the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

In the same year was chosen best Independent Production 2001 in Acquicomics Fair.<br/>Note: Tempus Draconis is the Multilingual edition of Millenarocca (Italian boardgame 2003); But this version have some better changes in the material, pieces and components. Rules in 5 Languages: Italian, French, English, German and Spanish!<br/><br/>The game develops in 4 phases:<br/><br/>* To set the eight prisoners free<br/>    * To complete your own Amulet<br/>    * To defeat the Monster<br/>    * To come out of the Millenarocca<br/><br/>1 - The Adventurers must set all the Prisoners free, and each Prisoner will give them a piece of Amulet. The first Amulet on top of the pack of cards must be given, you cannot choose. The prisoner freed last will reveal to which element the Monster belongs and this time he will give a piece of Amulet with a sign contrary to that of the Monster, no longer a piece chosen at random.<br/><br/>2 - After freeing the last prisoner, add the remaining pieces of Amulet to the &quot;Room&quot; pack of cards, so that every player can complete his/her Amulet. You can attack the Monster only if you have 4 pieces of Amulet and after all the Prisoners have been set free. Re-shuffle the pack of &quot;Room&quot; cards and also the pack of the &quot;Runes of Power&quot;.<br/><br/>3 - Chase the Monster and, if you are able to get it, give it a sound beating! The life points of the Monster are given according to the Monsters Table. It is not at all certain that you will be able to defeat it at the first attack. N.B. The Adventurer that defeats the Monster is teleported out of the Millenarocca, he is safe and he leaves the other players busy with phase 4 of the game.<br/><br/>4 - The Adventurers left must reach one of the exits and they must avoid perishing in the collapse of the Millenarocca.<br/><br/>Essentially, the winners are those able to come out of the Millenarocca.<br/><br/>",

Each round, players place their votes for the item types and spell categories they're most likely to be able to play. Three times during the game -- at the periodic Tribunals -- players are presented with 1st-, 2nd-, and 3rd-place awards for creating magic items with item types and spell categories that match those with the most votes.

        "description": "In the game of ブタバベル (ButaBabel), you are a pig who takes charge of building your Tower of Babel (&quot;Buta&quot; means Pig in Japanese). Your duty is to build a higher tower than everyone else.<br/><br/>Each card has one of rock-paper-scissors symbol. You can easily increase the height of your tower by placing a card from your hand onto your pile of cards, so that your card can defeat the top card of that pile.<br/><br/>But if you have built your tower too much higher than your opponents, the God gets angry and destroys your tower.<br/><br/>You can also raise opponents' towers in the same manner, so you should watch every tower and keep your tower at moderate height, though this game proceeds in real time so fast that you don't have enough time to watch closely.<br/><br/>When the players have exhausted the decks, the round ends and players compare towers by counting the cards stacked in each. In a three-player game, there is a fourth dummy tower as well. The tallest tower wins, unless it is three or more cards higher than the next highest tower. If it is too high, it's eliminated (tying towers likewise). Then compare the next highest tower to see if it is too high and so on. This way, it is possible for the dummy player to win.<br/><br/>The game is published with Japanese and English rules.<br/><br/>ButaBabel was re-issued in 2016 as a new version オニバベル (Onibaberu).<br/><br/>    This game is based on the Touhou Project video game.<br/>    The contents of the game are the same as Butababeru (only the art is different).<br/><br/><br/>Players become tengus and kappas that have been invited to a banquet of demons. Your goal is to drink just the right amount of alcohol and get home as fast as you can, before you can&rsquo;t leave at all!<br/><br/>The drinking is the easy part. All you do is stack up the cards in the way the rules tell you.

To be honest, they're mutants - animals with a giraffe body and alligator head. That kind of thing. Hunters are preparing to descend on the island to take home a few trophy animals, so it's up to you to save as many animals as you can. Save more than anyone else, and you win the game.<br/><br/>The game includes a deck of 30 animal cards &ndash; each showing one or two animals of the normal or mutant variety &ndash; along with 48 criteria cards and 18 special cards. Fifteen animals are laid out face-up on the table, then a player turns over a criteria card that shows animal-claiming restrictions (e.g., you cannot claim an animal card showing any part of a lion) or requirements (e.g. you can claim only those animal cards showing a blue starfish and a giraffe).<br/><br/>Each player has a color-coded island card, and once the criteria card is revealed, everyone races to slam their island card on an appropriate animal. Once everyone has done so or passed, they claim the card if it meets the criteria or lose a previously-claimed card if it doesn't.<br/><br/>Once most of the animals have been claimed, the second set of 15 animal cards is added to the table. Once at most one animal card is on the table, the game ends.<br/><br/>Galapa Go! contains two variants, one in which two criteria cards are revealed each round with animals being claimable only if they match both criteria cards, and a second in which the special criteria cards are shuffled into the deck at the start of play. These cards include conditions like claiming a non-mutant animal or claiming the animal that appears most or least frequently in play.<br/><br/>",

After some fighting and hissing Schrodinger finally manages to put the cat into the box and to close it. Happy that the struggle is over he proudly announces that from now on no one is able to know if the cat is dead or alive as long as nobody looks into the box. Schrodinger orders you and your colleagues assistants to watch the box and take notes. An so you do for hours and hours&hellip;<br/><br/>Finally, you have had enough. You turn towards your fellow colleagues, announcing that you will wager your position of first assistant to whoever is able to make the best guess on whether the cat is already dead and how long ago it died. Enthusiastically, everybody agrees, however you have a plan: to sneak into the laboratory at night and risk a peek into the box to make sure the most suitable candidate gets the title of first assistant. After all, who else would be more suitable than you?<br/><br/>In Dead Cat you try to guess how long the cat in the box is already dead. When it's your turn you have two options: you can either look into the box or you announce that the cat is dead.<br/><br/>If you decide to look into the box you take a card from the box deck, look at it without showing it to your opponent and put it on top of the time deck. After that you have to change your bet. Take the your betting die and change it to another site. You choose which one as long as it is not the same as before.<br/><br/>If you decide to announce the death of the cat the round ends and you start revealing cards from the top of the time deck until you find a dead cat or there are no cards left. In the first case the player with the closest bet to the amount of revealed cards wins the round, in the latter case the player with the highest bet. In case of a tie both player receive a point.<br/><br/>You play until one player gets 4 points.<br/><br/>",

Is it Little Red Riding Hood that has stolen an egg-roll and is hiding in New York? Or is it Christopher Columbus that has taken a hammer-head shark and is now hiding out in the Sahara desert?<br/>The player that first unravels the mystery will be crowned the city's new master-detective!<br/><br/>The players will move about the city, looking for clues as to WHO did the crime, WHAT they stole and WHERE the thief is hiding. The game has been compared to a mixture of Cops 'n' Robbers, Clue and a trivia-game.<br/><br/>When playing, the players roll the dice and then move about the board, trying to get to the different clue-squares (3 different color-coded clues to each part of the answer exists) where they get a clue as to who did the deed, what they stole or where they are hiding and they also get a clue-chip. These chips can be used to get help from the citys former master-detective if the player has a hard time in figuring out the clues.  <br/>When the player thinks he or she has the correct answer they move to the police-station as quickly as possible and once there they get to write down their guesses. If they have guessed correctly they win the game, otherwise they are out of the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player attempts to surround their spellcaster card with three cats in matching order, while at the same time, attempting to attack the other player's cats with magic spell cards. Once each player gets a turn, then the villains of the game or, the &quot;Cotter + Wife&quot; get a turn as well! These cards will attack cats from either opponent.<br/><br/>If your opponent attacks you with a deadly spell card and you can't deflect it with a magic card, then your cat is killed. However, that means your opponent has summoned the wrath of the &quot;Ancient Elder Gods&quot; and must pull a card from their deck, then follow what the card says. This is never good.<br/><br/>Once your spellcaster is completely surrounded on three sides with the proper cat cards, thrown down a &quot;Kill&quot; card on the &quot;Cotter + Wife&quot; card to win the game!

As a rail baron in the 1880's American West, you try to expand your railroad empire by moving goods and passengers between cities. You may invest in new trains and stations or upgrade your trains to make them go faster and carry more goods. Buy goods where they are cheap and sell them where they fetch the best price. But beware: Gangs of desperadoes hired by rival rail barons will try to hold up and rob your trains, or blow up the tracks to derail you.<br/><br/>A roll-and-move game where you each turn will roll three dice; your large trains will move the sum of all the dice, your small trains the sum of the two highest dice and your gang of desperadoes the highest die. Pay to pick up goods in cities (small trains may carry one good while large trains may carry two) or pick up passengers for free. Deliver goods and passengers to the cities accepting them, your profit will depend on how far you moved the goods. Goods available for buying and selling are fixed for the different cities and prices are pre-printed on the board. If an opponent's train pass your gang of desperadoes you will rob the train if you roll higher on a die than your opponent does (trains cannot change direction and are forced to use the entire die roll and hence you can maneuver to force them into your ambush). Other features are &quot;telegrams&quot; (a la community chest cards), marshals and sticks of dynamite...<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the first to reach a given number of &quot;success points&quot; (victory points), which you get for buying trains and stations and for cash in hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mobscenity is a card game where players take turns picking 2 seemingly innocent words from the deck to create a Mobscenity Phrase. Each player then tries to come up with the most obscene definition for the phrase. The game can be downloaded for printing under a Creative Commons license.<br/><br/>The oldest player starts in the role as the Master and take six cards from the deck. The Master chooses two cards from her/his hand and places them face up on the table. These two cards become the Mobscenity Roots. The Master then states what the Mobscenity Phrase will be by combining the two terms. For example, if the Master plays the cards &ldquo;Wax&rdquo; and &ldquo;Dolphin,&rdquo; the Master can state the Mobscenity Phrase is &ldquo;Waxing the Dolphin.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The other players are given 3 minutes to write both 1) a definition of the Obscenity Phrase and 2) a sentence that includes the Obscenity Phrase (the Master can decide to boot people from the round if they do not finish on time). When the time is up, each player folds up their written response and puts it in the hat. Players take turns reading the responses, and the Master decides which response s/he likes the best. The player with the best response gets 1 point.<br/><br/>",

There are 5 white dice (par 4s), 2 red dice (par 3's) and 2 blue dice (par 5s). Each dice has the ability to shoot above par, par, or below par. There are as many formats as there are golf side games, but players typically play in one of two formats:<br/><br/>Traditional Format:<br/><br/>All nine dice are rolled--the player chooses at least 1 die, but can use more than one to count toward his/her 9-hole total. The remaining dice are picked up and rolled again. Players have the option of having multiple dice count toward their score, or choose as few as one and try to &quot;GO LO&quot; (shoot a low score--golf parlance).<br/><br/>Golf Course Format:<br/><br/>In this format, the players must follow along to the scorecard of their favorite course, or any course. If the first 9 holes (&quot;Front 9&quot;) at Pebble Beach are laid out in this order--4-4-3-4-5-3-4-4-5=36, then when the player begins by rolling all 9 dice, he/she must play the course &quot;in order&quot; by choosing two par 4's before he/she may then chose a par 3. Having to go in the order of holes on a golf course creates a different strategy and usually produces higher scores than the Traditional format.<br/><br/>In all formats, tournament play is the most exciting--where players are playing against each other, and their scores are affecting other players' choices and strategies.<br/><br/>A game primarily for non-gamers and sports nuts, which nevertheless is a very strategic, &quot;push-your-luck&quot; dice game. It is not just a matter of rolling dice and counting up your score; the requirement of keeping one or more dice each time you roll presents many interesting choices, depending on what your opponent has done, and what you already have kept for scoring.<br/><br/>The game is sold online and in major golf shops and golf stores. Game includes a cup, nine dice, score pad, pencil, and rulebook.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Hollywood Card Game is a fast and simple card game from Bruno Faidutti and Michael Schacht, designers of such games as Citadels, Coloretto and Fist of Dragonstones. This exciting and unique card game invites players to compete to get the best directors and most famous actors for their films. With an easily accessible theme, and simple but deep gameplay, The Hollywood Card Game appeals as much to casual gamers as it does to hardcore strategists.<br/><br/>The game plays over 3-4 rounds (the same number as the number of players), with each player having one turn to play first. Each round a new Hollywood Area is created by shuffling 3 Star cards and 11 Movie cards together and dealing them out into 4 columns. Players take turns either placing a marker on the bottom card of a column (pushing the preceding markers up the column), or playing one of their Studio cards (Skip a turn, or take two turns in a row). Each studio card can only be used once per game. Once each card in a column has a marker on it, that column is closed, and no more markers have been played in this column.<br/><br/>Once all players have run out of markers, the round is over, and cards are allocated to players based on the marker on the card, and starting from the TOP left corner. Cards are allocated one at a time, and must be used on a Project immediately. Film cards must be allocated to a Project of the same genre (Horror, Action, or Romantic Comedy), or allocated to a new project if the player does not already have a Project of that genre. Star cards must be allocated to any project, however this will immediately complete a Movie, which no more cards can be added to. If a Star card cannot be allocated to a project, they cannot be held to add to a later project. Movies score points for the number of Film cards in them (with Award Film cards counting twice), multiplied by the number of stars on the Star card. Blockbuster cards stand alone and are worth 2 points each. Additionally, each player scores one point for each Film card in their largest unfinished project (no ties allowed). The player with the most points wins. If players are tied, the player with the single most valuable movie is the winner.<br/><br/>The Hollywood Card Game contains 64 cards, 16 film reel chips, and a rule sheet. The game is suitable for three to four players Ages 8 and up<br/><br/>",

A unique game unit rotates to reveal cards labeled with sets (underwater animals or Paris landmarks, for example).  A timer on top of the unit is then set as the player reaches into an enclosed dome, blindly searching for the pieces on the card.  The other players watch his groping through a clear opening in the dome.  A card is collected only when the last piece is drawn.  Points are awarded for pieces drawn and cards collected with a bonus for having a complete set.<br/><br/>",

Run out of cards, and you're out of the game, with the last cardholder winning!<br/><br/>Other games have you looking for pairs of cards that sum to nine or a sandwich of two cards of the same color/number with another card in between them or even two number cards that sum to a third visible number card.

You can roll at most three times, so knowing when to keep your result or gamble for a better one is the difference between victory and defeat.<br/><br/>Players record these points on an individual scoring board with tracks for each color, and the first player to move all colors to seven points wins. Progress is complicated by three barriers on the scoring tracks, which cannot be passed unless all colors have been bumped to a certain level of points &ndash; thereby forcing players to push their colors evenly.<br/><br/>Einfach Genial: Das W&uuml;rfelspiel was originally released as one of three games in Fantasy Flight Games' Ingenious Challenges.

        "description": "Climb the most dangerous massif in the world! In Annapurna you co-operate &mdash; or compete &mdash; with your fellow climbers to achieve balance on this treacherous, ever-changing mountain. As you explore your mountainside made of cards you will encounter rockslides, yetis, and danger at every turn!<br/><br/>You start with a deck of 18 mountain cards, laying out 15 of them face down in a pyramidal mountain and keeping the rest as your backpack. Each card has a yin or yang value of 1-4 on it as well as a special effect. To start the game, each player reveals a card in their bottom row, carries out the effect, then places their meeple on the card.<br/><br/>On a turn, you explore an adjacent card on a non-lower level by flipping it over, carrying out its effects, and placing your meeple on it; trade a card from your backpack with a card in your mountain, pacing the replaced card in a cache; or hide a card, which is the same as trade, but on another player's mountain. If your face-up mountain cards have a balance of yin and yang, you can remove them from play.<br/><br/>Once you reach the mountain's peak, you add your cache to your hand, then you can spend your turns doing nothing, dropping cards from your cache face up on the mountain to better balance your yin and yang, and throwing cache cards onto another player's mountain, who then flips up one of your remaining face-down cards.<br/><br/>In the competitive game, when everyone is at the peak, players score 3, 2, and 1 flags based on who is most balanced, with ties being broken in favor of whoever ascended their mountain first; play multiple rounds until someone collects nine flags and wins. In the co-operative game, you end the game after everyone has scaled their mountain, and you all win only if everyone has an even yin-yang balance.<br/><br/>There are also rule books for Cooperative, Solo, and Team play.<br/><br/>",

If you're in a deadlock, the player who's Agent Gibbs, will decide!<br/><br/><br/>This game has 6 potential suspects in each case, with a little background. There are 8 things you can investigate each round (the suspects, plus the crime scene, and research in headquarters). There are clues that you don't have the time or resources to hear, so you have to decide where to focus to get the information you need. That doesn't always mean just the person you think is the suspect, sometimes another person gives you a clue about your main suspect.<br/><br/>If you put an investigator on an area, there is a number to look up and read in the book to tell you what information has been found.

Players agree on an ending time for the game, perhaps 1-2 hours, then each player must perform or act out his three challenges during that time in a subtle manner, but with witnesses.

        "description": "Sudden Death is a surround placement type of game. During your turn you place down 1 of 3 different plastic pieces made up of either two, three or four squares. The board consists of 441 squares and each player starts on his own side. The object is to block the other players to prevent them from playing any more pieces. You are allowed to jump over one square. To speed up game play, the designers included a button connected to a 9-volt battery and to a timer in the middle of the board. The button slowly rises and after a certain number of seconds, a buzzer goes off. If the buzzer goes off, you pay a penalty of losing 2 two-square pieces. The timer can be set to go either quickly or slowly.<br/><br/>",

The map is made up of hexes of various land types with varying combat affecting statistics.  Units have a set number of action points with which they can move or carry out their other unit abilities such as changing or picking up weapons.<br/><br/>The geas component is the most unique, forcing players to send their heroes off on perilous quests despite whatever plans had been previously made.<br/><br/>Optional rules include the inclusion of healing, land sinking into the sea, and a more complicated combat system.<br/><br/>",

At the word card deck you will find 9 Mariano Rajoy's sentences chopped into pieces, so each card of the deck will have one piece of any of the sentences. The objective of the game is to build new sentences up by remixing the original sentences.<br/><br/>This are some of the sentences conforming the game:<br/>&quot;Un vaso es un vaso y un plato es un plato&quot; (entrevista a Televisi&oacute; de Girona, 23-9-2015).<br/>&ldquo;A glass is a glass and a plate is a plate&rdquo; (interview at Televisi&oacute; de Girona, 2015-9-23).<br/>&quot;Espa&ntilde;a es un gran pa&iacute;s que hace cosas importantes y tiene espa&ntilde;oles&quot; (Mitin del PP, 17-5-2016).<br/>&ldquo;Spain is a great country that makes important things and has got Spanish people&rdquo;. (at a Popular Party's meeting, 2016-5-17).<br/>&quot;Lo que nosotros hemos hecho, cosa que no hizo usted, es enga&ntilde;ar a la gente.&quot; (Tribuna Parlamento, 2-3-2016)<br/>&ldquo;What we have done, which you did not do, is to deceive people&rdquo; (Tribune of the Spanish Parliament, 2016-3-2 ).<br/>&quot;Espa&ntilde;a es una gran naci&oacute;n y los espa&ntilde;oles muy espa&ntilde;oles y mucho espa&ntilde;oles&quot; (Mitin de del PP, 20-5-2015).<br/>&ldquo;Spain is a great nation and the Spanish people is very Spanish and a lot of Spanish&rdquo; (at a Popular Party's meeting, 2016-5-17).<br/>&quot;La cer&aacute;mica de Talavera no es cosa menor, dicho de otra manera: es cosa mayor&quot;.

(Rueda de prensa, 2015-9-24).<br/><br/>How to play: Eight cards are dealt to each player: six word cards and two &ldquo;Fin de la cita&rdquo;. The first player opens a sentence by placing a card on the table. In turns, each player must continue the sentence by adding a card that is gramaticaly correct with respect to previous word cards; it doesn't need to make any sense. Each &quot;Fin de la cita&quot; allows you to close the sentences: so when a sentence is gramatically closed, the player in turn can close the sentence by using a &quot;Fin de la cita&quot; and he we'll win the sentence.<br/>That is a general explanation of the game rules.<br/><br/>",

A deck of shell cards &ndash; with cards worth 1-4 points and starfish action cards &ndash; is shuffled and placed on the table.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player can discard a mermaid/merman or matching pair of items to take the top shell card, discard a mean mermaid to steal another player's shell card, ask another player for an item card (a la Go Fish, drawing a card if you come up empty and scoring if you hit), play a sneaker wave to remove one opponent's shell card from play, or play seaweed to force someone to draw a beach card. If someone collects a shell card that is worth points, that player places the card on the table; if the shell card features a starfish, every player passes one beach card left or right as instructed.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has no cards left in hand or has only the sea monster in hand.

Everything goes well at the beginning when they calmly agree on the same amount of candies for each of them, but soon they come up with more and more ideas and a debate starts&hellip; the Pig says,&ldquo;Those who weigh over 10kg should get an extra candy!&rdquo;... the Dog says, &ldquo;Whoever oversleeps should return a candy to the pool!&rdquo; To resolve their hectic argument, they finally decide to form the House of Pets, at which the animal councilors will discuss proposals and vote on new laws. Who can get the most delicious candies in this exciting voting game?<br/><br/>Based on Karl-Heinz Schmiel's Das Regeln Wir Schon, players attempt to pass laws which benefit themselves.  The laws are either immediate or semi-permanent, and they can have all kinds of different effects: all players with beards get five points, vote cards must be played with the left hand, or some sort of re-evaluation or redistribution of the chips that each player has.  The chips are the main way that players score, but their worth fluctuates constantly.  On a turn, a player draws a card and then proposes a vote, and this continues until the End card is drawn.<br/><br/>A winner of the 1999 Concours International de Créateurs de Jeux de Société.<br/><br/>",

Played in 5 phases, you'll find that the decisions you make about where to play your cards and how you attack, defend, and consume your resources will set the course of the game and determine victory or defeat.  Each aspect of the game is multi-layered.  In addition, you can mix and match the cards in the box to design your own decks and take control of your own ApocalypZe.<br/><br/>Your deck of cards represents your supplies and resources during these trying times. During the game you will consume these resources and do your best to replenish them while trying to force your opponent to waste through his own. Once you run out of supplies, you no longer have the capacity to survive and are out of the game.<br/><br/>During each turn you play cards to one location on the table. This may be your stronghold or your opponent's. It may also be another type of location such as a scavenging location. You must choose your location carefully each turn. If you choose to act against an opponent, you will not be able to sure up your defenses.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the game you be able to defend your stronghold and scavenge for resources with survivors, and attack your opponent's stronghold and scavenging locations with zombies and other raiders. A number of types of cards that both enhance your characters and affect the game in various ways can be played throughout the course of your turn.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, you will be forced to consume resources (cards). As your deck dwindles, you will have to make some hard choices to insure that you will outlast your opponent and survive the ApocalypZe.<br/><br/>",

You're the pro with all the stuff to get the job done.<br/><br/>This game is based on the popular TV sitcom Home Improvement. You are a do-it-yourselfer that gets inspired by various sources to do projects around your house. The board, consisting of an outer ring of stores and other spaces, and an inner ring with all the rooms of your house. Cards representing each project are drawn. Each card has a list of supplies and tools you need for the job, and what stores to buy them from. Players then travel around the outer ring buying the things they need, and marking them off of the project cards. When the player has one or more project cards filled they can move into the inner ring and go to the room the project is for. A rating card is drawn (1-4) and a description of the project is read. The back of the project card contains four different outcomes for the project ranging from spectacular to horrible, these match the rating card and instruct the player what benefit they get from their project. Each project can add equity to your house. The first player to increase the equity of their house by $50,000 wins the game.<br/><br/>This is a fun lighthearted look at home improvements. You don't have to even pick up a hammer to feel like a pro!<br/><br/>",

Great for any age or gamer type.  Based on the popular RPG KOBOLDS ATE MY BABY! and featuring the art of JOHN KOVALIC (of Munchkin and Dork Tower and Kobolds Ate My Baby! fame).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Commander Chess, or Cờ tư lệnh (literally &quot;Chess Command&quot;) is a xiangqi variant created by Hải Qu&yacute; Nguyễn.<br/><br/>Cờ tư lệnh is played with 38 pieces (19 per player)    on a board that is 11 lines wide and 12 lines long. As in xiangqi, it is played on the vertices of the grid. The board is divided into two lang territories by a river in the middle of the board. The three files on one side of the board form the sea. The object of the game is to capture the opponent's Commander, or all units of a single division of the opponent's army.<br/><br/>The pieces on both sides, with their abbreviations, movements, and rules, are:<br/><br/><br/>     1 Commander (C): moves any distance orthogonally; captures 1 point orthogonally; may occupy Headquarters; may not &quot;see&quot; the opposing Commander on an open file<br/>     2 Infantry (I): 1 point orthogonally<br/>     2 Tanks (T): 2 points orthogonally; may capture on sea squares it cannot enter, remaining stationary; carries C, In, or M<br/>     1 Militia (M): 1 point orthogonally<br/>     2 Engineer (E): 1 point orthogonally; carries all pieces, only across river; controls airspace 1 point any direction<br/>     2 Artillery (A): 1&ndash;3 points any direction; crosses river only at reefs, by attacking, or carried<br/>     2 Anti-aircraft gun (AA): 1 point orthogonally; may capture on sea squares it cannot enter; controls airspace 1 point any direction<br/>     1 Missile Rocket (R): 1&ndash;2 points orthogonally or 1 point diagonally; controls airspace as it moves<br/>     2 Air force (AF): 1&ndash;4 points any direction; may return to its departing point after capturing or carrying, unless capturing opposing Af; carries C, In, or M; destroyed immediately on passing through opposing airspace<br/>     2 Navy (N): 1-4 points any direction on sea, sea banks, and river banks; captures as it moves at sea; shoots 1&ndash;3 in any direction at land targets; controls airspace 1 point any direction<br/>     2 Commander Base (B): stationary and does not capture; may house only C; protects C, but not itself, from In, M, Aa, and Ms<br/><br/><br/>General rules:<br/><br/>     Pieces capture as they move, and never jump, unless noted.<br/>     Pieces can cross the river but not occupy sea points unless noted.<br/>     Pieces which check the opposing Commander are promoted, gaining special abilities.<br/><br/><br/>The Chinese xiangqi has generally been the most popular form of chess played in Vietnam. In fact, there is no traditional distinctively-Vietnamese chess game; which is partly what inspired Cờ tư lệnh.<br/><br/>Cờ tư lệnh is played on the vertices of an 11x12 &quot;geographic&quot; board similar to the 9x10 xiangqi board, with the addition of an ocean occupying files A&ndash;C and two &quot;reefs&quot; allowing all pieces to ford the river. It shares many features with wargames, including area denial, ranged attack, and unit cooperation.<br/><br/>Besides the fact that Vietnam has never had a distinctive regional form of chess, Nguyễn noted four complaints with xiangqi influenced the creation of Cờ tư lệnh:<br/><br/>1. Xiangqi promotes individualism and class conflict, particularly in the willingness of players to sacrifice low-level pieces to succeed.<br/>2. Winning xiangqi is due more to luck than to intellect.<br/>3. Xiangqi does not reflect the geography and history of Vietnam.<br/>4. Xiangqi has many rule variantions, none of which are accepted by the entire community.<br/><br/>Each of these points is answered in Cờ tư lệnh:<br/><br/>1. Pieces cooperate through a &quot;carrying&quot; and area denial mechanics. As well, losing an entire class of piece loses the game, forcing protection of and cooperation among all classes.<br/>2. Nguyễn believes the interactions between pieces and influence of geography necessitate more strategy and reduce the role of luck.<br/>3. Besides the single river of xiangqi, there is an ocean, as well as &quot;reefs&quot; across the river, all of which interact with special piece rules. Besides the Vietnam-like geography, the pieces modern rather than ancient military structure.<br/>4. By promoting Cờ tư lệnh educational programs, Nguyễn hopes to ensure that a single authoritative set of rules is used by all players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher, Tilsit Editions:<br/><br/>In the country of Skaaland, each player heads up a clan of dwarves with only one idea in its collective head: to become Skaal, the royal clan the most respected among all of the dwarves. But getting the respect of the dwarves, who are small but proud, is not a simple matter. You need to be a good gold prospector but also an honoured beer brewer!<br/><br/>After a preliminary placement phase during which the pieces are set up on the game board representing Skaaland (with its regions and villages), each player tries to win respect points.<br/><br/>Each turn, each player may only carry out one of the six available actions. Players can bring new dwarves into the game, move those already on the board, prospect in search of gold, mine discovered gold, open a tavern or move a tavern.<br/><br/>The problem with dwarves is that they're sometimes a little impetuous. For example, if a player discovers gold in a region, a rumour of its discovery immediately propagates across the land and the dwarves from the neighbouring regions arrive at top speed to see the new discovery. Not a moment's peace!<br/><br/>Sometimes, while prospecting, a player runs into &quot;oops&quot; instead. That's annoying because the effort was wasted, and it means that there will never be any gold in that region.<br/><br/>But gold isn't the only thing that matters in life! Digging is thirsty work and if a clan has a majority in a region, it may open a tavern. If the dwarves are too drunk to dig, then the clan that owns the tavern gains, each turn, respect points equal to the number of dwarves from opposing clans around the tavern. And that's good!<br/><br/>The drunk dwarves either flee this village of debauchery, or return with their buddies and take over the den of iniquity.<br/><br/>Contents: 1 rules insert, 1 game board, 90 dwarf figures, 12 tavern markers, 1 sack of 'gold', 1 sack of 'oops', 1 prospecting pawn, 1 special die.<br/><br/>This game is the 3rd in the Tilsit Collection series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Galapagos, players move around the island searching for new species of turtles and trying to stay one step ahead of everyone else. With good planning and some luck on the dice, you'll collect more turtles than anyone else and triumph on this whirlwind island tour.<br/><br/>During set-up, players arrange the island tiles, then place five or six turtles on various tiles, depending on the number of players. Each player places his character token on the island and takes five color dice.<br/><br/>In each round, all players simultaneously roll their dice, then arrange them in the order they want to use them. Whoever first completes his planning grabs the sand timer in the center of the board, starting the timer for everyone else to finish their plans. Once time runs out, this player moves his character on the island, moving it to an adjacent space matching the color of the first die in his plan, then moving it again, and so on &ndash; ideally picking up lots of turtles along the way. The other players take turns in clockwise order. A player who lands his character on a corner space can move to either adjacent corner space (as long as he's placed the correct color in his movement chart).<br/><br/>Players add turtles to the board to bring the total available to five or six, then start a new round. Once all the turtles have been collected, the game ends and the player score for the turtles they've collected: 8 points for a set of six differently-colored turtles, and 1 point for each other turtle. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Toppling the Reich: The Battles for the Westwall, is an operational level simulation of the fighting for the Rhine River and Westwall that occurred in 1944 and 1945. Designer John Prados transports his Panzerkrieg game system to the Western Front to examine the major episodes of this clash. Using scenarios, which can also be linked together to form a campaign game, he covers the entire war in France and the Low Countries from early September 1944 to the German surrender in May 1945. Players on both sides will be challenged with conducting offensive operations as well as desperate defenses.<br/><br/>Units are mostly divisions with some specialist brigades/regiments (engineers, commandos, heavy or specialized armor units). Players can form larger Corps level formations that enhance combat actions. The air war is also covered with air units on both sides conducting air superiority, ground support, parachute and aerial supply missions. The game design is easy to get into, but loaded with much decision-making for both players. The level of supply and logistical support determines how many units and leaders can conduct operations in the turn. Leadership on both sides, in the form of the various Army and Front Headquarters as well as the leaders from each, play vital roles in the various operations each turn. While the Allies can field a tremendous force across the entire front, the lack of ports and the Allied ever-lengthening supply lines will be a challenge in keeping the offensive moving. The German player will have less of a challenge in providing logistical support, but his already battered Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe and SS formations will face a hard time in fending off the enemy&rsquo;s attacks while also gathering strength and resources for a counter-strike. Timing, planning, and making the most of the opportunities presented to you on the battlefield are key to success in this game by award-winning designer, John Prados.<br/><br/>Rules in Toppling the Reich include ones dealing with the various Army and Corps Commanders on both sides, Paratroop drops and airpower, a very clever depiction of ULTRA capabilities (and failures), the planning and timing for German counter-attacks. Toppling the Reich is actually six different games: five scenarios which cover the Western Front from September 1944 to April 1945 and one 36 turn Campaign Game which includes this entire period. The smaller scenarios include:<br/><br/>Scenario 1: Broad Front or Narrow Thrust? (Market-Garden) - Sept. 1-24, 1944 (four turns)<br/>Having broken out of Normandy, Allied troops capture Paris and press toward the German frontier. The Germans strive to rebuild the strength of their Fifth Panzer Army, destroyed in the Falaise Pocket, and to reconstitute a solid defense. The Allied commander has a very limited attack supply capability and must choose between attacking all along the front or concentrating for a single powerful attack.<br/><br/>Scenario 2: See Germany and Die! Closing Up to the Westwall - Sept. 25-Nov. 11, 1944 (8 turns)<br/>Against a rapidly solidifying German defense, Allied armies attempt to maximize their gains in spite of their still limited supply abilities. The full deployment of the Allied Sixth Army Group north of the Swiss border and the continued offensive stance of Patton&rsquo;s Third Army press the Germans in Lorraine back towards the Rhine. At the same time, the Americans in the center take Aachen while the British attain the line of the Meuse.<br/><br/>Scenario 3: The Roer River and Lorraine - Nov. 12-Dec. 10, 1944 (5 turns)<br/>Greatly recovered from its Normandy debacle, the German army by November 1944 is offering stiff resistance to the Allies. For their part, Allied armies attempt to clear the right bank of the Rhine in Lorraine, and to expand and secure their penetration of the Westwall at Aachen. This stage of the war sees some of the most bitter and bloody fighting in the Western Front.<br/><br/>Scenario 4: Herbstnebel-Nordwind: From the Bulge to Alsace - Dec. 11, 1944-Feb. 2, 1945 (9 turns)<br/>The Allied advance has been essentially brought to a halt before the Westwall. The German High Command made a conscious decision about their strategy for the next phase of the campaign. Adolf Hitler opts for a counter-offensive, and attacks are planned in the Ardennes and toward Strassbourg. The Germans throw their best forces into a last great gamble to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.<br/><br/>Scenario 5: The Defense of the Rhine - Feb. 4-Apr. 3, 1945 (10 turns)<br/>After the failure of the Bulge and Alsace offensives, an exhausted German army returns to the Westwall to discover that the Allies are already prepared for a bone-shattering frontal offensive. Allied troops grind through the Westwall defenses and the Germans attempt to hold the Rhine. Hitler, dissatisfied with the situation in the West, relieves his best commanders. With the end of the war nearing, an important question for the Allied Command is what kind of attack force should be brought to bear against Berlin.<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/><br/>    One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>    Two dual-side printed countersheets (480 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>    One 20-page Toppling the Reich rulebook<br/>    One dual-side printed Toppling the Reich Special Rules Player Aid<br/>    Two single-side printed set-up Player Aid charts<br/>    Three dual-side printed 11x17&quot; scenario set-up sheets<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/><br/>    Game Turn: 6 days<br/>    Hex: 5 miles / 8 kilometers<br/>    Units: Battalion to Corps<br/><br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-15 hours<br/><br/>",

This is where you plun...er, &quot;recover artifacts&quot; from the Titanic.  After the ship is raised, the game now becomes a race to the Home Port with the ship's log.  All players get an advance from the publisher and the race proceeds.  The player with the log rolls only one die to the others' two, and the log changes hands each time the player with the log is caught up with.<br/><br/>Winner is the player with the most money from artifacts recovered, fame points garnered and the ship's log bonus.<br/><br/>The board is centered on a plastic column with a spring inside; a large model of the Titanic rests on the spring, loaded down by the weighted artifacts.  As the latter are recovered, the model naturally climbs up towards the top of the column.  Simple, clever and visually quite effective.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is popular in Europe. It is played with three dice and an number of tokens (&quot;fiches&quot;, usually 11 or 21) and it is not uncommon to find special porcelain boxes, marked with the dice numbers 4-2-1.<br/><br/>Play is in two phases. &quot;Charge&quot; and &quot;D&eacute;charge&quot; (discharge).<br/>Charge phase : all players roll the dice once and only once, each. The biggest hand takes as many tokens as the value in points of his or her hand. This process is repeated until all tokens have been distributed (with the last hand taking has many tokens as are available). If a player has all tokens at the end of the charge, the game is finished (and he or she pays a round of drinks).<br/>Discharge phase : The player with the biggest number of tokens has the first roll and then clockwise. The first player of a round of rolls decide for one or two rerolls. A reroll meaning rerolling one, two or all dice, to try to achieve the best hand. By electing to have rerolls, he or she allows the same number of rerolls to the other players. The one who rolls the biggest hand gives a number of tokens equal to the value of his hand (or all of his tokens if not enough) to the player who rolled the lowest hand. That player becomes first player.<br/>The game ends when one player has all tokens. He's the loser of the game and pays the next round.

        "description": "SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS is an uncomplicated war game centered on the naval aspects of the series of wars between England and the various European powers between 1756 and 1805 for dominance of the world&rsquo;s oceans.<br/><br/>The game depicts this conflict at a strategic level, with most operational and tactical details represented by fast and easy-to-play systems, rather than intricate mechanisms.  The intent of the game is to provide a broad overview of the historical events while being fun to play.  SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS owes its original inspiration to the game concepts of WAR AT SEA published by The Avalon Hill Game Company, a game which covered the war in the Atlantic in World War Two.  SOVEREIGN OF THE SEAS borrows a number of these concepts from this earlier game as a starting point, such as area movement, individual capital ships, individual leaders, battle line resolutions, and rolling sixes to hit, and then diverges significantly to reflect the sailing warship era situation.<br/><br/>The object of the game for the English player is to destroy the naval forces of the  European Powers player and prevent them from obtaining control of vital sea areas around the world.  The object of the game for the European Powers player is to escape the forces of the English player and obtain temporary sea control of vital areas to support the continental and colonial objectives of various European nations.  The game uses over 650 counters, a two piece map, and numerous organization cards and play aid sheets.<br/><br/>Product Information<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 out of 10<br/>    Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10<br/>    Time Scale: Yearly turns<br/>    Map Scale: Area<br/>    Unit Scale: individuals ship<br/>    Players: 2 or solitaire<br/>    Playing Time: 3-4 hours hours<br/>    Designer: Stephen Newberg<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>Two 22 X 34 inch maps<br/>    Six Countersheets &ndash; approximately 600 counter<br/>    One Rulebook<br/>    Rules and Scenario book<br/>    Player Aid Cards<br/>    Dice<br/>    One Box and Lid set<br/><br/>",

Every round, each player rolls two dice and uses any two of them to move or to activate the tile's special feature. Once all of the players have used their dice, the stone behind them moves and tries to smash the last runners. Players do not only move their goblins forward, but they can also activate special features of the tiles, complicating the game for their opponents.<br/><br/>",

The rules and concepts are simple enough to appeal to kids from 6 to 96 yeas of age. But, don't let the simplicity fool you. While Eternas is quick and easy to learn, there is a depth of strategy that will keep you thinking. Eternas is a four in a row style game in which the first player to place four bead of their color in a row, either vertically, horizontally or diagonally, wins the game. Conceived around the shape of the circle (the symbol for eternity) Eternas was designed for borderless play. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Eternas is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.<br/><br/>",

Players then take turns turning one card in the circle face up and moving the bird pawn that many spaces clockwise. If they land on a face down hippo they are safe and score one point for every face up hippo they passed. If they land on a face up hippo they take the card as a penalty (-2 points at the end of the game) and replace it from the draw pile. Instead of choosing a card from the circle, players may discard any other player's penalty card and move that many spaces.<br/><br/>The game ends when the draw pile is empty.

Opponents may have cards which burn your logic or block your actions.<br/><br/>Once the argument is fully debunked, players receive one point per fallacy they successfully laid, plus 1 point for the player who finished the argument, and then the next argument is placed in the middle (giving the player who finished the previous argument first dibs).<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no more arguments to debunk, and the sweet song of reason finally echoes peacefully. The player with the most points wins and the player with the least points believes in anything and everything!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Race your penguins across ice floes, while avoiding the hungry polar bear. The game board is a 4x4 array of movable ice floes; more exactly, each one is either on the right or the left of its square, and this is critical for adjacency. You split your movement points between your penguins and moving the ice floes (which is good when you can shift several carried penguins), but sometimes the die has you move the polar bear instead. It chases after penguins, sending them back to the starting area.<br/><br/>The game has some similarities to the German game Im Reich des weißen Bären that was designed by Charles Lerue and published by Schmidt Spiele in the same year (1991).<br/><br/>",

The Gorgangrackles eat the Anglerfin. The Anglerfin eat the Chumtails. The Chumtails eat the Trollsharks. The Trollsharks...well they eat each other. Between the moistened mountains of Bluff and Butte sprawl the villages of the Nautilus, a peculiar race of tentacle-bearded nature-lovers. The villages are said to reside on top of a rare mineral deposit of UnderAether.<br/><br/>Topside a Cog would give his left leg for a small glimpse of the material. The UnderAether could supply their steam-factories for centuries and here it is resting under the tentacles of water breathers. The Rivalry has been fought for years. Now the famous Gearhead's Brigade has been sent by the High Cog Warden to investigate a strange beacon in the deep dark depths.<br/><br/>Rivals: Masters of the Deep is a tactical game for two or more players set in the cold dark depths of the Lurk. Players take command of either the Cog or the Nautilus, gather a fighting force and, through wise decisions and strategic moves, destroy the opposition. In Rivals, Cog &amp; Nautilus go head to head on the battlefield. Your team will engage in fast-paced combat and interact with the board itself. The Creatures of the Lurk will come out of hiding, coral will try and eat you, Underwater rip tides will batter you, all as you fend off your opponent.<br/><br/>To Setup your game you first gather your army by spending Aether. Each model has a cost. You then pay for any abilities or starting equipment you would like your army to have. You then create the &quot;Lurk&quot; Map. The Lurk is where all battles in the base game play out. The Lurk map is made with hex tiles. After setting up the map, including all card decks and dice, you place your units in the starting points. Your teams are now ready to do battle.<br/><br/>There are two phases for each side, a Movement Phase &amp; an Action Phase. During the Movement phase you may activate up to two hexes worth of models to begin their movement. After all movement is completed the player moves on to the Action phase. Like the movement phase you may activate up to two hexes, same or different, to begin their Actions. In the Action phase each activated model can perform one of four actions or a special action. The basic actions are Attack, Search, Recover or Charge. There are special areas on the map that you can search and explore but be wary because there is usually danger in dark places. The map also contains dangers and difficult terrain including Coral, underwater geysers and much more.<br/><br/>Turns go back and forth until your opponents hero is destroyed.<br/><br/>",

For conveniences, Jie decides to name these symbols &quot;Zi&quot;, which means &quot;character&quot;.

On a turn, you choose a task card that shows a theme and score points by identifying two of the many kanji that match your theme from among the old letters.

        "description": "An update to the VCR games Nightmare from 1991 and it's 1995 successor, Atmosfear.<br/><br/>The aim of Atmosfear is to collect a key from each of the six regions of the board before heading to the &quot;Well of Fears&quot; in the center and attempting to draw your fear from among those of your opponents in order to win the game. This must be done before 49 minutes pass, or all players lose automatically.<br/><br/>Atmosfear uses a DVD that acts as a timer, constantly ticking away toward the end of the game. The Gatekeeper also frequently appears on screen and causes problems for any or all of the players. Just like its predecessor, Atmosfear makes for stressful play -- players rush to take their turn and pass on the dice as quickly as possible before the Gatekeeper appears and calls on them. <br/>Unlike the original, the adaption to DVD means encounters with the Gatekeeper are randomized rather than in a fixed order, so you cannot predict when he will turn up next. It also means that new events can come up several plays on, although as with the original, in the long run, players may still become familiar with the possible events, leading to reduced replayability.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First issued in 1989 for fewer players, the second edition (released in 1996) is for 2-6 players. The board has two sides, for racing either 3 or 4 colored donkeys. Players are given a card secretly, each showing the donkey's finishing order, a different result for each card. The board shows a patchwork of steps across a field from start to finish, each space with a colored arrow matching the donkeys. When you move a donkey onto a space marked with a green arrow pointing left, you then move the green donkey one space that way. If that space then has a blue arrow pointing right, you next move the blue donkey on one space that way. This goes on until you cannot move the final donkey because it is blocked. Eventually, the donkeys cross the finish line, and the player with the best matching result on their card wins. More of a competitive puzzle than a game, it is a nice diversion, but awkward because the donkeys constantly fall on their sides. Possibly Doris &amp; Frank's first game and related to their Bunny Zick-Zack.<br/><br/>3rd Place 1989 Hippodice Spieleautorenwettbewerb (as Donky [sic]).<br/><br/>",

Each robot is represented by a composite miniature that you put together using the available components. There are two different command units (heads), two main thrusters (bottoms), and four equipment tenders (middle pieces with six slots in them), with which you can make Scouts (combots with one tender), Warriors (two tenders), or Marauders (three tenders), although you don't get enough tenders with the game to build a pair of Marauders.<br/><br/>Now comes the fun part. Not only can you custom-design your combots, you can actually build them by sliding various modules into the slots in the equipment tenders: claw arms, lasers, laser shields, aiming units, missile launchers, armor plates, etc., etc. When you're ready, deploy your combots at either end of the included diamond-shaped hex map and guide them into battle; the last robot with any remaining functional offensive modules wins.<br/><br/>Approximate playing time is a guess. Two players is the maximum for a standard game; scenarios are provided that allow up to five players to play in the diamond map, or more players in user-designed maps, but you would have to buy either extra copies of the game or components for additional miniatures.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game where you choose a character with some different stats, and then play cards and draw new cards from the stack until the stack runs out of cards. The one with the most &quot;votes&quot; in the end gets elected to high scool president and thus wins the game.<br/><br/>It's a humour-based, hilarious but rather complicated card game where a lot of the enjoyment relies on you knowing the clich&eacute;es in japanese animation concerning high school comedy. Though there's a lot of japanese text on the cards, it's playable without knowledge of japanese if you have a translation sitting nearby. Moreover, you learn what the cards do rather quickly.<br/><br/>Game description<br/>There are two card piles: the play card pile and the &quot;standard vote&quot;-pile. The &quot;standard vote&quot;-pile contains only cards with a number of votes, 1 to 6 on each card. The play card pile consists of special vote cards (can be worth a lot, and also may have special powers), action cards (that affect other players) or event cards (all players have to sumbit to certain conditions).<br/><br/>At your turn, you draw a play card and (unless it's an event card wich affets all players) may either take 2 actions OR draw yet another game card. Actions include drawing a standard vote card, playing a game card from your hand, or using a special power (from your special vote card or your character).<br/><br/>The &quot;standard vote&quot; cards are kept hidden, people can see how many you have but not how much they're worth. The special vote cards however, (which are worth much, representing votes from whole clubs like the baseball team, the newpaper club and so on), are placed before you. These can be &quot;attacked&quot; by action cards, either nullified or stolen. Some action cards can cancel other action cards, and some special votes cards can be immune to attacks like these if you discard cards from your hand etc.<br/><br/>So the game goes on until you've taken 2 laps through the draw pile of game cards. When the fourth event card is drawn, game ends immediately, and the person with most votes win.<br/><br/>As said, much of the flavour of this game consists of clich&eacute;es in high school anime. The names of the standard vote-cards are sometimes hilarious. Some one-vote cards are named &quot;the ghost girl who nobody has ever seen&quot;, &quot;the maid robot&quot;, &quot;the one who secretly goes to a certain market selling certain home made comics&quot;, other cards include &quot;the I don't know whatever&quot; (3 votes), &quot;the ones with a boyfriend&quot; (2 votes), &quot;the diet girls&quot; (4 votes) et cetera. The special vote cards are typical high school clubs in japanese high schools.<br/><br/>A very nice game but probably only for those who enjoy the style.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A quick and simple card game for 2-6 milk-drinking players. Each player places a color card down as their marker and the matching sets of cards numbered 1-12 in those colors make up the deck. The deck is shuffled and players get 4 cards, the remainder goes down as a draw deck. There is a set of small tiles in red and black for negative or positive points (red are 4,4,5,5,6,6, black are 2,3,3,4,4,4,5,5,5,6,6,6). These are shuffled face down and 4 turned up to start 4 rows.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can place a card against a row or try to swap a card with another player. If you want to swap, you simply offer a color for another color, mentioning no numbers. Swap with the player of your choice, but if nobody wants to swap, you've wasted your turn.<br/><br/>When you play a card to a row, you draw back so you have 4 cards. When the row is full, determined by the number on the tile, the player with the highest total in the cards has to take the tile, be it positive or negative. Usually your choices are obvious, but sometimes it is worth assisting another player to take a row, rather than waste a good card for you on a low or negative tile. If a row is tied between players, the cards are discarded and the tile stays for more cards.<br/><br/>The discard deck is shuffled over, taken tiles refreshed by new ones. The game ends when the tiles are all taken, deduct the negative from the positive to get your score.<br/><br/>This game was re-themed and expanded on with Relikt.<br/><br/>",

To do this, they clap their hands one time for each animal, and they slap the table a number of times equal to the animal's place in the sequencing row &mdash; but they don't want to do this too clearly because for each incorrect guess by an opponent, that opponent must give the clue-giver a card from his scoring pile. Whoever guesses correctly claims the card, and whoever has the most cards in scoring pile once the deck runs out wins.<br/><br/>",

Other prospectors and you must avoid crossing paths with the creature or else you must leave the mountains forever.&quot;<br/><br/>The game centers around a model of the BigFoot. 10 plastic disks (5 blank and 5 with the footprint of the Bigfoot) are secretly loaded into the base of the creature. Players start with two tokens of matching color. Each player rolls the dice and must move one of his tokens the full dice count, in either direction. The board features various locations and special action spots. When a player's token lands on a Bigfoot space, he/she rolls the dice again and moves the creature the full count. If the creature moves over an opponent's token, a disk is dispensed and if it is a footprint, that player's token is out of the game. The winner is to be the survivor after Big Foot has removed all other opponents. The game is intended Ages 8 - 14, but it's fun for adults as well.<br/><br/>",

Arm your townsfolk, fight off the monsters, and don't let those other mobs steal any of your glory.  Torches &amp; Pitchforks is the card game that's easy to learn and fun to play.  Fight the monster menace today!<br/><br/>(my take)<br/><br/>A cute &quot;Defend your town&quot; game where you fight monsters and attempt to score 30 points (points are awarded based on the defeated monster's power).  Nice time-filler as games a relatively quick.  It has a feel similar to &quot;Munchkin&quot;, &quot;Groo&quot; and others, but is definitely in a class by itself.

Additionally, when playing their penultimate card from their hand, players must shout 'UNO' or face a forfeit of drawing two further cards.<br/><br/>WHAT MAKES THIS DIFFERENT FROM TRADITIONAL UNO: Olaf&rsquo;s Summertime Card. When you play this card, you are permitted to discard up to 3 cards from either pink, or yellow colors. This card permits you to also change the color of play.

        "description": "Imagine 7 cards each with a drawing of a different Traffic Cop. You see the front of some cops and others you just see their back (from the rear). Each card is unique because in addition to the cop, they each have a diffrent symbol on them, i.e. a Tree, a Stop Sign, etc. Now put them in a circle with their feet toward the inside of the circle. Further, you also have a deck of 21 Direction cards and each has a symbol (which corresponds to the ones on the Traffic Cop cards) and 3 directions on them, i.e. A Tree, 4 Rights, 3 Lefts, 2 Lefts. This Direction deck is placed face down in the center of the circle. Anyone flips a direction card and it all starts; start at the Traffic Cop that has the matching symbol, then move left and right as the card calls for, but remember you must move to the Traffic Cop's left or right. So depending on if they are facing forward or backwards, you go the appropriate direction. Whoever calls out the correct stopping place first, by symbol, wins the card. Good game similar to Ikarus.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "One hundred and fifty years have passed since the first match in the Galactic Arena. This ancient mystical arena was originally located in an abandoned Serpente subsystem forgotten by time. After the First Apocalypse, the Terrans built endless numbers of space platforms to colonize space, and an agreement was brought forth between the Terrans and a mystical sect of great influence to lease the space platform CETUS-7. The ancient arena was rebuilt on top of the platform, taking the galactic fights into space.<br/><br/>The Atomic Brotherhood holds all the broadcast rights for the Arena, netting them trillions of Credits for every minute of every fight. Their aptitude for organizing unconventional games makes them exceedingly popular with the masses, and now the time has come again. Gladiators from all over the galaxy are gathering on CETUS-7. Only five heroes will survive to face the coming Apocalypse. The Oracles have spoken the words: &quot;May the Zenites shine upon you.&quot; Those who cannot understand their meaning are destined to meet their doom.<br/><br/>Apocalypse Universe: Galactic Arena, the first of five projects set in the Apocalypse Universe, is a strategic science fiction &quot;hero vs. hero&quot; game that takes place in the Galactic Arena of CETUS-7. The guiding principle of this game is replayability. Each hero has different stats and abilities, allowing unique builds that depend on player choice.<br/><br/>The game is played by 2-6 players and can be played as 1vs1, 2vs2 or 3vs3. In 1vs1, the players follow a draft procedure and pick 1-3 heroes out of the ten available. After both players have chosen their heroes, they prepare them to enter the Arena. Heroes can equip weapons and special abilities before combat. The arena board consists of a grid of hexagons with starting positions, secret traps, and treasure crates.<br/><br/>Both players secretly choose, then reveal heroes, placing them on the two starting positions of the board. The hero with the highest initiative score plays first. The player controlling him is considered the attacker and his opponent is the defender. Each hero has a number of action points that can be used to perform his special abilities, to defend, or to attack. A ten-sided die is used for attacking and defending. The attacking player adds his hero's attack score to his attack roll and the defending player respectively adds his hero's defense score to his defense roll. When a hero is wounded, he loses health points &mdash; and at zero health, he's defeated.<br/><br/>",

In this game you can achieve victory only with a quick tongue and even quicker brains.<br/><br/>The game is played with a non-standard 52 card deck. Each card has two fields: subjects and an initial letter. There are three different subjects - one each of the three difficulty levels: easy, moderate, and difficult.<br/><br/>The first card drawn from the deck specifies the subject of the word that the players should find out. The second card specifies the initial letter of that word.<br/><br/>After the second card is turned the right way up the player who says a word that matches both of the requirements wins every card below the topmost. The topmost card is reused as a subject for the next word and so on. In the case of tie a new card is drawn and the previous cards remain in the pot.<br/><br/>The game ends when the last card of the deck is played and the winner is the player who has gathered most cards.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by Avista Pro.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Quick Wit<br/><br/><br/>",

Let's say a controversial Issue comes up that is worth negative points. After all, there are some topics that no matter what you say, you're going to lose voters. Wouldn't it be handy if one of your opponents gave a Good Speech on the issue?<br/><br/>Each player is given a Candidate card at the start of the game representing a well know political persona. <br/>Each Candidate card has a built in special ability and Favor points.<br/><br/>A revolutionary part of the game design is the introduction of &quot;Favor&quot; points. Each player starts the game with a couple Favor chips, and players may trade them back and forth as they wish. There are no rules governing the trading of Favors. Here's the cool part, at the end of the game, every Favor that you have that came from another player counts as a Vote. Your own Favor chips do nothing for you at the end of the game!<br/><br/>Wheel and deal! Gather political favors and be the power all others seek in desperate times, and at the end of the day, you'll be seated in the Oval Office!<br/><br/>Some have said this seems to make the point that political favors are just as important as votes in American Politics.<br/><br/>Is this a bad thing?

The catch is that no player knows just how valuable the item is, only that it is offered at less than full value. After fifteen questions, the player with the most money can either buy a more expensive prize with their winnings, or keep their money in hopes of winning again, and being able to buy something even better. After each person has had a chance to host, the player with the most money and merchandise is the winner.<br/><br/>Two editions were made of the original 1969-74 series, although the first was reprinted (in 1971?) with an altered cover: one prize was changed to a TV, and the set shot cuts off the left side (where the host is) in favor of another prize.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>     Sale of the Century Quizzard<br/><br/><br/>",

But can you always believe their stories?<br/><br/>Every player gets five cards, showing one of five animals with quantities of 1, 2 or 3. The starting player plays a card face down on the table, making a claim such as &quot;I have seen one Yak&quot;, then draws a new card. Next player adds to that stack, raising the claim, either by raising the number or the size of the animal. The cards in the stack represent the animals which have actually been around. Play continues in clockwise order until a player calls a bluff and flips open the stack. If it doesn't contain at least as many animals of the last kind as were announced, the bluffing player takes the stack as a penalty, if it does, the caller takes them.<br/>Beware, there are some special cards that players can sneak into the stack, those which reduce the numbers on the cards or those that make all animals appear as the same kind.<br/>When the draw pile is exhausted, the player with least penalty cards wins.<br/><br/>The game is a simplified reimplementation of Bluff im Zoo.<br/><br/>",

And what if we add enough grapes to the silver to produce 100 liters of wine? Or 1000 tennis balls? Or...<br/><br/>Each of the 188 playing cards in Sauschwer asks for the weight of a person or one or more objects. On a turn, the active player estimates the weight in his mind and places the card next to one end of a seesaw scale. After that, he places a wooden pig on the side of the scale that he thinks is now the heavier side (adding the &quot;weights&quot; of all cards on both sides in mind). If at least one other player doubts that guess, all players bet on one side of the scale being the heavier one. The result is often close and surprising, and the players who guessed correctly earn victory points.<br/><br/>",

The board is divided into a grid and a treasure detector is used to search for the buried treasure. The gold bags are magnetic and the treasure finder has a window that turns red when it has passed over treasure. A die is used to determine how many squares can be searched in a turn. The detector has a window that must be closed prior to searching for treasure. After moving the detector over a number of squares, the window is opened and if it has turned red, the detector has passed over a piece of your opponents treasure. By strategically searching the grid, a player is able to determine where the buried gold is hidden. A treasure map is provided to aid in remembering possible locations. The winner is the player that can locate all three treasure locations before his opponent. If you are not correct in all three locations, the opponent automatically wins.<br/><br/>",

You try to go out (empty your hand) during each hand; score is kept and the first player to reach 100 wins.<br/>   Each player is dealt 6 cards.  You begin by placing two cards of your choice in front of you, face up, to create two discard piles.  The two cards played must match either by colour or by number.  In turn, you play one card from your hand onto any of the discard piles.  To play onto a pile, the card played must match the other pile's card in number or colour.  If you can't or don't wish to play a card, you must draw cards until you can play one.  Should the draw be exhausted, a new deck is made from the discard piles, keeping only the topmost cards.<br/>   To go out, your discard piles must at least tie all the others in number value.  Score is 10 points for the player who went out, plus the combined values of the cards left in the other players' hands.

To set up, shuffle the 30 base cards with the six case-specific cards. In each round, the investigators are given a picture card, which everyone examines carefully. Then the cards are passed on to their neighbors in turn. When everyone has looked at the cards, they discuss together which cards should be placed face up in the middle to help solve the case. A total of twelve cards may be revealed to answer these questions: Who is the victim? Is there a murder weapon?

Play as Cale and do your best to rescue the orphans, or play as Richard and harvest these innocent souls before the fire gets them first.<br/><br/>Every turn is divided into two phases: the action phase and the fire phase. During the action phase, you have three actions to use and six actions from which to choose: Move your pawn; Guide an orphan; Put out a fire; Stop, drop, and roll; or your character's two special actions. During the fire phase, roll to see how many fires spread, following the immutable rules of the fire phase.<br/><br/>Cale's player gets to use the pawn's unique orphan-hauling grip. Cale's arms are designed to hook onto the orphans' hands, allowing our elven hero to carry the orphans he saves with him.<br/><br/>Richard uses the red fire pawns that, like the yellow fire pawns going around the orphanage, clip to the base of the pawns they set on fire.<br/><br/>Orphans &amp; Ashes is a fast-paced two-player tile-laying game with push-your-luck and dexterity elements that plays in 45-60 minutes. The game contains over one hundred plastic pieces, including more miniature orphans than any other game on the market, guaranteed.<br/><br/>",

Before the game starts, the players also allocate their shields around the ship's periphery.  Combat is a simple affair, and the rules are very skimpy.<br/><br/>Battlefleet Gothic was actually still called Space Fleet Gothic in 1998, one year before its release.<br/><br/>",

Do your job too well, and she'll promote you to management - a responsibility feared throughout the realm. Do your job too poorly, and you'll be demoted to professional dog food instead.<br/><br/>The game is played with your hand facing outward, giving you no knowledge of the hounds you have. Every round has a different player serving as the shift leader, who can see both their hand and everyone else&rsquo;s. The shift leader gives each player three clues as to the hounds they are holding - how helpful, useless, or beguiling the clue is up to you, but they must be true. The shift leader also assigns Cerberus to a player, a trump card pup that wins any trick he shows up to.<br/><br/>Players have a few opportunities to try and manage their luck, and must promise how many shifts they will work (tricks they will take) based on the limited information they have of their own hand, and the hands of the other players they can see. Cards are played, tricks are won, and a new round begins. After everyone has taken a turn as the shift leader, the game is over. The player who scored the least without going negative did the least amount of work without being fired, and wins the game!<br/><br/>Thus, Heckin Hounds is a game of being barely adequate.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

One dragonfruit chit per player color is then placed on each section of the game board.<br/><br/>To play the game, someone turns on the air blower, then places the ball on the air jet at the center of the board so that it floats over the volcano. The active player each turn tries to blow the ball into one of the board sections with a dragonfruit chit of her color, with only one chance to get the ball in the right spot. If the ball lands on a board section with a dragonfruit of her color, she takes that chit and places it on her game board. Whether she gets it or not, though, the next player then takes his turn.<br/><br/>The first player to collect six dragonfruits of her color wins!<br/><br/>",

To help you win, you must break into the dojo and look for the best weapon you can find at the break of dawn. The game is made up of five rounds with each round consisting of three turns followed by a battle phase. Each turn has three phases:<br/><br/><br/>    Select: Each player secretly chooses an action.<br/>    Reveal: All players simultaneously reveal their chosen action.<br/>    Resolve: Actions are resolved in ascending order.<br/><br/><br/>After three turns, a battle occurs and a new round begins. The player to win the most battles after five rounds is declared the winner. In the event of a tie, the players tied play one additional round, called the showdown; whoever wins the showdown wins the game.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Ninja Dojo Fight! is a micro game inspired by Entropy. You play as a ninja from one of four rival disciplines. As a ninja in training on your final test, your goal is to win the most battles using the weapons at your disposal.<br/><br/>The game play has similarly to the main counterpart Entropy, through the use of simultaneous action selection, but it's not quite the same game. With only 42 cards, it is more thematically and technically accessible than Entropy. The visual design is minimalistic and the cards do not have any text.<br/><br/>",

Leave the remaining cards face-down as the Draw Pile.

Leave the remaining cards face-down as the Draw Pile. Leave some space on the table for a Play Pile and a Discard Pile.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/>The first player to get rid of all their cards wins!<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/>Choose a player to go first and rotate clockwise. They can play any card to start the Play Pile.<br/><br/>On each turn, you must match or beat the top card of the Play Pile. You may play more than one of the same number or face card on your turn. Higher numbered cards beat lower numbered cards. Special Llama cards have their own rules. You can find these rules on the cards themselves or on the Llama Hierarchy instruction card.<br/><br/>If four cards of the same number or face are played in a row (either in one turn or over consecutive turns), the Play Pile is discarded and the last player plays again. When the Play Pile is empty, a player can play any card to restart the Play Pile.<br/><br/>At the end of a turn, if you have fewer than five cards, draw cards from the Draw Pile to have five in your hand. If on your turn you can't play a card, pick up the Play Pile (yes, the entire Play Pile) and add it to your hand, ending your turn.<br/><br/>Special Rule:<br/>Four cards of the same value played in a row discards the current play pile from the game.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/>Once the Draw Pile runs out, your objective is to get rid of all of your cards. Once your hand is empty, you must play your face-up cards. If none are playable, choose one, and add it to the Play Pile. This pile will become your brand new hand! Yes, you have a hand again. Aren&rsquo;t llamas fun?<br/><br/>If you pick up cards, you must finish the cards in your hand before you can play your face-up cards again. Once you play all your face-up cards, you must attempt to play your face-down cards, without looking at them. If the card you flip fails, you must pick up the Play Pile with that card, ending your turn. You must once again finish the cards in your hand before you can play your face-down cards again.<br/><br/>The first player to finish all of their cards wins!<br/><br/>Card Types:<br/>Numbered Llamas -  Numbered Llamas can be played on themselves, lower number llama cards and some special llama cards.<br/><br/>Baby Llama -   The Baby Llama can be played on any card.  The next player can then play any card.<br/><br/>Shy Llama -   Shy Llama can be played on any card other than Big Llama.  The next player can then only play Numbered Llama cards 1-4 or other special llama cards other than Big Llama.<br/><br/>Big Llama -   Big Llama can be played on any card other than Shy Llama.  The next player can then only play other special llama cards other than Shy Llama.<br/><br/>Magic Llama -   Magic Llama can be played on any card.  It discards the play pile and allows the player to play a second card, thus starting a new play pile with any card.<br/><br/>Ghost Llama -   Ghost Llama can be played on any card.  It is invisible and acts like the previous card.<br/><br/>",

Players are big investors (and I mean big - the smallest notes are $50 million and billions of dollars change hands) and wheeler-dealers.<br/><br/>Players acquire shares in companies, primarily randomly (picked up as cards), but also possibly through purchase of other players' previous sales. To form the companies they must also acquire resources, which are bought from 4 sets. The pricing mechanism for these is like Palmyra and McMulti - each purchase increases the price and each sale decreases it. Once an appropriate set is acquired for a matching set of (at least two) shares in a company, the company can be formed. Companies pay income to their owners each turn. They can also be sold off at a premium, or split up (provided the owner has enough shares and resources) to gain double income. The real heart of the game comes in the option to conduct hostile takeovers. A player lays one or more shares in a company owned by another player and then starts a bidding war to takeover the company. Each player is bidding to buy the shares of the opponent (bids are per share). The &quot;winner&quot; gets the company and all the shares, the &quot;loser&quot; is paid off at the final bid price. Who is actually the winner and loser depends, of course, on the balance of the final price.<br/><br/>There is a sudden death variable finish, when assets plummet in value, so there is a tense few final rounds when players can try to realize assets while they are still valuable. During this period the judgment of takeover prices becomes even more tricky (and a gamble).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "I originally 'tasted' Catch 22 at one of Major Fun's soir&eacute;es, where it was an instant hit. Players have to move around a multi-path board by the throw of a die landing on jackpot spaces and collecting 'gold coins' (at least 22 of them....) before they attempt to cross one of several finish spaces with their bounty in tow. Unfortunately, once you have coins, you become a target (when you land on another player, you get their gold).<br/>Each player has five plastic 'blocker cubes' that he can place on empty spaces. These blocks stop everyone but that player from continuing along a particular path.<br/>Besides the spaces where gold is available, there are those one can land on to switch places with the player of your choice and spaces that allow you to take a blocker cube off the board, which basically means it's not over till it's over.<br/>The board's multiple paths give at least a few options on each turn, unless an opponent has blocked your way.<br/>And don't worry if somebody's nabbed your gold. Revenge is sweet!<br/><br/>",

One of the five picture tiles is then inserted into the special &quot;camera&quot; included in the game; this camera consists of a squarish cardboard device with a mirror standing vertically on the diagonal of the square, along with a cut-out &quot;wing shape&quot; on the bottom of the camera. When a picture tile is inserted underneath the cut-out, the &quot;camera&quot; will create a butterfly from the part visible through the cut-out together with the mirrored wing. Since you can insert square pictures in four directions, each picture can create four butterflies depending on how it's orientated.<br/><br/>Once players see the image of the butterfly created, they now try to find this specific butterfly by turning the tiles face up, one by one, until a player finds the matching butterfly. Since the tiles remain face-up during this time, players have the opportunity to memorize as many cards as possible.<br/><br/>Once a player succeeds, he collects the matching butterfly card and places it face-up in front of him. All other butterfly cards are turned face down again. The next player now exchanges the picture tile, trying to insert the next one in a direction resulting in a butterfly he is able to locate immediately. This is more difficult than it seems as you have to imagine the butterfly just from the picture before inserting it.<br/><br/>The player who collects the most butterfly cards wins.<br/><br/>",

The game is packaged in a wedge (&quot;piece-of-pie&quot;) shaped box.<br/><br/>The game does not feature a game board, and thus, there is no roll-and-move mechanic. Instead, players roll the colour coded die, and answers a question matching the colour rolled. The colours correspond to categories that include geography, entertainment, history, arts &amp; literature, science &amp; nature, and sports &amp; leisure. If a player correctly answers a question, he may &quot;go for a wedge&quot; by answering another question in the same category. If he does so, he keeps that card. If the player answers a question incorrectly, it is the next players turn. Play ends when a player has collected six cards/correctly answered 12 questions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Exploration was a very popular 1970s game from Britain's best game company, Waddingtons. The dramatic &amp; colourful box cover, showing the Kon Tiki raft, mountain climbers, ziggurats, and scuba divers on a wreck, inspired thousands of British kids to explore the globe, at least in their fantasies. To win, you must mount an exploration to one of four Objectives (Lost City, Summit, Island and Sunken Galleon), return to base and make the most money. Being first back was not enough, you've got to make the best profit on your trip.<br/>The game is played in 2 phases; initially you move round the outer track on die rolls, collecting Personnel cards, buying Equipment cards and drawing Exploration Club cards (which may gain or cost you cash to the Prize Fund). When your group is assembled, take the appropriate dobber (Yacht, Lorry, Tent or Ship) and set off.<br/>The 2nd phase has you moving over land or sea using the unique Diradice, a d6 with a 5 symbols. These allow you to move 1 or 2 spaces orthogonally or diagonally. The problem is that the spaces on the board are littered with symbols which you can only cross if you have the correct equipment, like the compass, dinghy or mountain boots. You must have an explorer with the Main Objective to reach your goal, but the other personnel allow you to avoid hazards and reach Lesser Objectives (Skeleton, Pearls, Rare Flower etc.) to gain cash. 1st, 2nd and 3rd home get cash and 1st back gets the Prize Fund.<br/>A pretty simple game of dice rolling, the only real choice is when to launch your trip. But the theme, the striking board and cards and that weird die makes this a fondly remembered game in the UK.<br/><br/>",

The player who has selected the fastest vehicle chooses first the route card that comprises the most steps, among the available ones. The other players take turn doing the same. The last player to choose his route section will be able to use his booster, which is a power specific to the pilot he controls, as a support for the following turn.<br/><br/>The played &ldquo;Vehicle&rdquo; cards become available &ldquo;Route&rdquo; cards for the following turn, which can now begin.

        "description": "A Battle of Wits (a Princess Bride game) is an exciting game of bluff and double bluff for between two and ten players. A row of goblets sit in the middle of the table, ready to be filled with either wine or poison. Players each take the role of one character but it is only at the very end of a game that they will drink, one from each goblet. During the game, they must play their cards, one each turn, either into the top of a goblet (adding poison or wine to a goblet) or to the bottom of a goblet (bidding on the goblet). Who will fall prey to their enemies and who will eliminate themselves? Only the most intelligent will survive!<br/><br/>",

You desperately want to get rid of your burden but must carry it until you arrive at the cross. Your destination is the Celestial City where you will receive a wonderful inheritance. To successfully complete the journey, you must travel through some dangerous territory. Evil forces will seek to discourage and defeat you by putting hindrances and obstacles in your path. You may become bogged down in the slough, face hungry lions, battle with Apollyon or encounter the terrible Giant Despair. You must be alert at all times, prepared to use the spiritual weapons acquired throughout the journey to defeat the enemy and receive your final reward.&quot;<br/><br/>Similar to &quot;Life,&quot; you walk through stages of a spiritual (Christian) journey facing the obstacles as described in John Bunyan's book &quot;Pilgrim's Progress.&quot; The four pawns are &quot;pilgrims&quot; each having &quot;burdens&quot; that are removable. The object of the game is to remove the burden as fast as possible with game cards (i.e. Faith, Encouragement, Armor of God, etc...).<br/><br/>",

If the team guesses the correct word in time, they earn a token. The first team to collect four of these wins the game.<br/><br/>Challenges come in the following forms:<br/>- Pantomime: A picture with Disney characters tells the player which activity has to be mimed.<br/>- Drawing: The player has to draw something on the drawing board.<br/>- Party glasses: The player has to wear the party glasses, look at a picture and guess the Disney character that is shown (the glasses are tinted red, which makes some of the lines in the drawing disappear).<br/>- Who am I? A card with the image of a Disney character is placed in the card holder. Only a small section is shown, and players have to guess which character it is.<br/>- Find something that is... for example, green. The player has to find an object from the house/flat that matches the task.<br/><br/>",

However, the treasure map has been torn into many pieces. Whoever has a quick eye for combinations and can piece together the map won&rsquo;t lose his way and will find the most treasure. An intriguing lickety-split, brainteaser game for 2-4 players ages 6-99.<br/><br/>Players take turns rolling the die. If a 3,4, or 5 is rolled, that player draws that many path cards to their hand. If a genie is rolled, the top card of the assignment deck is turned over so everyone can see it. Each player draws the number of cards on the assignment card and adds it to their hand.<br/><br/>When all players are ready, they all turn over their path cards. Players are trying to arrange their path cards so that all paths connect, while trying to make the arrangement of their path cards match the pattern on the assignment card. The first player who does this correctly wins the round and takes a treasure card. The game ends after four rounds, and the player with the most treasure wins.<br/><br/>",

The gameboard is a six-by-six grid. The perimeter squares are called the Outer Path. The Outer Path surrounds the squares called the Inner Path. The center four squares have been merged into the Pond, which is the goal area. Players roll both dice on their turn with the goal of getting one&rsquo;s own frogs into the pond to win. The frogs may be stacked but an opponent whose frog rests on top of the stack can freeze a stack of two. An opponent can not freeze a stack of three.

When you form a (horizontal or vertical in the square grid version) connection between your newly added stone and one or more of your on-board stones, you form a larger group.  You can only make such a move if said larger group will connect with an enemy group upon its creation, and if said larger group is larger than all of the enemy groups it connects to.  Then all those enemy groups are removed, and you must add another stone while it is still your turn.

There have been at least 14 editions of this game published. Speed is a predecessor of the popular game UNO and a contemporary of Whot.<br/><br/>Players are dealt a hand of cards (6 cards for 2 or 3 players, 5 cards for 4 or 5 players). Players play cards by matching the set of the previously played card (Aeroplane, Train, Ship, Motor or Animal), or by playing a card bearing the same number in the top corner (the Animal suit has 2 numbers per card). When a player is unable to do either of these, he draws a card from the draw deck.<br/><br/>'Lightning' cards act as wild cards, allowing the player to call the next set to be played.  There is one 'Extra Turn' card that can be played in addition to a normal card (hence the only chance to get rid of 2 cards in a turn).<br/><br/>When the first person has finished, the others score penalty points equal to the sum of the numbers on the cards they have left in their hand.<br/><br/>",

Like most wars, this one is full of mutiny, lies, and manipulation. The races have become fragmented, and now everyone fights for their own blood.<br/><br/>In game terms, each player starts play with ten cards in hand; cards come in eight types, with six of them being races that have an advantage when played against a specific race. On a turn, you must play a card that beats the value of the top card currently in play, play a mercenary (which automatically beats the top card), or play a battleground (which has an effect like &quot;the next player loses a turn&quot; or &quot;change the direction of play&quot;). Heroes, for example, gain +2 when played on Beasts, but are otherwise worth their normal value. Some races have the power to play a second card at the same time as the first or give an opponent a card from the player's hand. If you can't play, then you must draw a card instead.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to have no cards left in your hand, so players will have to think strategically about which races they take to battle at each opportunity.<br/><br/>",

The basic strategy is to hold the cards needed by the opponents, avoiding to open the sequences which can help other players&hellip; but opportunities to score points during the game can drive players to very different strategic approaches.<br/><br/>The game is for 4 players, but on the website you can find (and download for free) the rules for three a and five, the chess-like version for 2 players, the tournament variations and the play in partnership.

        "description": "Per the box:<br/><br/>This is a standalone game and IS NOT compatible with the original Zombies!!! board game.<br/><br/>MidEvil is the first game to be based on, and an extension of, the award winning Zombies!!! system from Twilight Creations. Players have escaped the modern-day zombie hoard only to find themselves transported back in time and faced with a whole new set of problems!<br/><br/>Game play is fairly straightforward.  Players start at the well and their objective is either to kill 25 points worth of skeletons or to collect the Necromicon from the graveyard and return with it to the Altar.  The various skeletons are worth different points, White are worth 1, Red are worth 2, and Blue are worth 3.<br/><br/>Players start by drawing a tile and placing it on the board anywhere it will fit.  They then place a number of skeletons and villagers as shown on the tile.  They then roll a six-sided die (d6) for movement.  Movement is orthogonal and limited to the tiles currently in play.  If you encounter a villager you can collect it; skeletons you encounter must be overcome.  At the end of your turn you again roll the d6 to move that many skeletons 1 space each.<br/><br/>Players can collect up to 5 villagers who can be sacrificed if they lose a fight.  Combat is simple - enter a square with a skeleton and on a 4 or better on a d6, you win.  If the roll is less than 4, you can either sacrifice a villager or pay skeletons to reach 4 or better.  There is no change, so if you roll a 3 and only have reds, you now have a 5.<br/><br/>Some of the cards also require specific colors of skeletons be used in order to power them and many require that you kill skeletons in order to play them.<br/><br/>Once a player reaches the Graveyard and grabs the Necronomicon, the other players can attack him during their turns to try to steal it away from him.  The game ends when someone takes the Necronomicon to the center tile of the Altar or collects 25 points worth of skeletons.<br/><br/>This Zombies!!! sized box contains 30 map tiles, 50 event cards,  6 pawns, 50 sculpted life counters (little gray dudes), rules and 100 HEAVILY ARMED AND ANGRY SKELETON WARRIORS!!! The whole game is done with the same realistic but very tongue-in-cheek style you have come to expect from Twilight Creations.<br/><br/>Part of the MidEvil/Zombies!!! series<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Midevil II: Castle Chaos<br/>    MidEvil III:  Subterranean Homesick Blues!<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Aquarium offers high player interaction as the other players can &ndash; and will &ndash; use their action cards to alter the available fish that you can buy and the price that you have to pay for them.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a set of nine action cards and $15. The deck is shuffled, then set up with three or four &quot;Feeding time!&quot; cards shuffled into the deck at various points. On a turn, a player first turns up a card from the deck if the market is empty (as it is as the start of the game). Then the player looks at the fish and plant cards in the market and decides whether to pass or try to buy them. If he passes, he takes $2 from the bank and adds the top card to the market; if he wants to buy, all other players get to influence what's on the market and what the cards cost.<br/><br/>First, each other player chooses one of their five action cards for use in phase 1 of a buy. These cards force the active player to add, remove or swap a card from the market or simply allow the card player to make a fish swap of his own! (Players can also pass, with all action cards but the &quot;pass&quot; being set aside.) Second, each other player chooses one of their five action cards for use in phase 2 of a buy. These cards add or subtract 1 from the cost of the market, or double or halve the cost of the market. In the latter case, the player of the card receives money from the active player instead of those coins going to the bank.<br/><br/>Once the goods and the cost are set, the active player chooses to buy all the fish and plants on offer or none of them. The cost is equal to the sum of the card values, plus or minus any modifications, then doubled or halved as appropriate. All purchased cards go into a player's personal aquarium. If a player has two identical fish, he can move them to a separate breeding tank where they will earn him 1-3 coins each turn.<br/><br/>Each time a &quot;Feeding time!&quot; card is revealed, players reveal one &quot;food cost&quot; card at random, then pay money equal to that cost times the number of stars on fish and plants in their aquariums. Any fish not fed starve and float away to the big toilet bowl in the sky. Each plant in an aquarium reduces the food cost by one.<br/><br/>After the final &quot;Feeding time!&quot;, players count the stars on their non-breeding fish, then receive bonuses for collecting all colored fish of the same size, all three sizes of fish of the same color and different varieties of plants. The player with the most stars wins.<br/><br/>Here, fishy, fishy, fishy...<br/><br/>",

Here, the theme is based on the popular detective television show Columbo. Players compete to be the first to either solve the mystery (collect four cards to create one figure, four cards to create one weapon, and one Motive card) or find Columbo (collect all six Columbo cards plus the one &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; card).<br/><br/>Contents: 1 game board, 2 six-sided dice, 4 pawns, 60 cards (24 suspect cards, 16 weapon cards, 6 motive cards, 6 Columbo cards, 1 &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; card, and 7 &quot;no clue&quot; cards).<br/><br/>",

Draco's &quot;Company&quot; is the feared &quot;Round Table Gang&quot;, a band of brigands who scour the kingdom's roads for loot and plunder. Every night, Draco and the gang gather together at the Shady Dragon Tavern to divide up the day's loot.<br/>In addition to his breath, Draco is famous for his drinking. He loves a good party! And when he starts to get &quot;happy&quot; he starts handing out treasure. Whenever someone proposes a toast, Draco gives rewards to the group of thieves on his good side. However, Draco does love his money, so he makes any player on his bad side give up some of their treasure at the same time.<br/>With the aid of drink and furious fawning and elbowing, all the gang members try to stay on Draco's good side and avoid his bad. All in an effort to gain the bandit King's favor, and consequently get a bigger part of the loot.<br/><br/>Rerelease of Die Tafelrunde.<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately, humanity was no match for its own creations and armies of terrifying monsters were soon out of control in their destruction of civilization. In their final global nuclear strike, humanity accomplished two things: They wiped themselves out, and they created a highly mutagenic environment where the monsters could thrive.<br/><br/>This is the world at the start of Teratozoic, a light deck-building game. (From greek: terato-, of or relating to monsters, -zoic, of a (specified) era, or having a (specified) animal mode of existence.) Each player has their own deck of monster parts (their gene pool), and will attempt to make the best of the mutations they draw from a common deck to come out on top in the battle for survival. At first the monsters will be more random mutation than representative of a stable gene pool (players will draw most of the cards for each hand from the common deck), but by the time players reach the Teratozoic Era, their monsters will be built entirely from the best traits they've been able to retain each generation.<br/><br/>The dominant species in this new era (the final winner of the game) will be the one with the most robust gene pool&mdash;the player who can create the biggest, most impressive monsters at the end of the Teratozoic Era.<br/><br/>",

If the player succeeds in meeting that requirement, the newly played card sets the new requirement in addition to the new active player.<br/><br/>Some of the cards in the game are also cards with special effects that modify the usual restrictions in some way, harming opponents by making them draw cards, giving you the ability to temporarily alter the value of your own cards, or allowing a massive discard under very specific conditions.

You get points for how large the group of like faces that border on each other are.  The points are taken from your neighbor.  The points are in the form of coins from 1 to 5 in worth forcing kids to actually do math (shudder).  The tiles is replaced after playing and if the white tile is drawn it allows the player to steal a tile from another player and the white tile is then replaced in the bag for others to possibly draw again in the future.<br/><br/>For the younger kids it can teach color matching.  You can also play with the expressions on the tiles (Happy, sad, scared and mad), such as when you play a tile you have to make the expression.<br/><br/>A simple game for ages 3 to 7 (although the box says 5 and up)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The beginning of the twentieth century was marked by an extraordinary art movement known as Art Nouveau, which aimed to modernize design away from the previously popular eclectic historical styles.<br/><br/>Alphonse Mucha, born in Moravia in 1860, was one of the artists closely linked to this artistic movement. The Czech became known for his work in 1894 when famous actress Sarah Bernhardt invited him to produce the poster for the play Gismonda.<br/><br/>From then on, Mucha started producing other posters and advertisements of various products, always emphasizing its most striking features. Her style drew attention because it portrayed with emphasis the feminine forms, in a kind of Byzantine mosaic that plays with colors and floral arabesques.<br/><br/>In La Muse, we bring a gallery of 20 works by Alphonse Mucha to compose the game cards, produced between 1897 and 1902.<br/><br/>In the game, we are collectors looking for the most beautiful and valuable works of Alphonse Mucha. By allocating data about Musa's cards, we can collect them for our portfolio by performing special effects and gaining gems.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the player with the highest gem value is considered the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Picture cards add wrinkles such as allowing players to steal cards from the hands or played sets of opponents. Card sets and the points they bring are safe only when the correct picture card - Andy/Willi finally getting a beer - is played.<br/><br/>",

Paired players then argue topics such as &quot;Who would win in a fight, Mary Poppins or Judge Judy?&quot; or &quot;What is more nerve-wracking: a first date or a job interview?&quot;  The non-arguing players then vote on who they felt argued best, each vote equaling a point for the arguing players.  After every player has argued twice, whoever has the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>&quot;What's fun is that the Player Assignment Cards also determine which side of the argument you must take, even if you do not agree with that side,&quot; says White.  &quot;So, for instance, if you can't stand rap music, you may be put in the position to argue why you think rap music is great for society.  This can be quite entertaining.&quot;<br/><br/>Included with Argue is 1,000 topics, a precision timer and 100 optional Distraction Cards.  These can be used to make arguing more of a challenge by causing players to perform outrageous stunts, such as arguing &quot;while smelling your left shoe&quot; or arguing &quot;while jumping up and down for 15 seconds.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Klondike in 1896! The discovery of gold, in one valley by the river in today&rsquo;s Yukon in Canada, had started the greatest gold rush ever related to Alaska wild-west. Get there as one of two to four gold- miners and experience one of two possible game variants this title offers. Each variant, based on different principles, stands as a complete game and offers a different gaming encounter&hellip;<br/>In the first game variant each gold-digger is in a search for the best parcels in his landscape to claim them for treasures to be gained. Golden nuggets bring victory points and rubies are to be possibly spent as resources for claim tokens in random and limited offer. In an auction player can smart out the others for strategic claim tokens or bluff them out of rubies as well. .. in other words checking on others might work a bit too! <br/>The first player, in a round based flow, who manages to dig through to the other end of his landscape, presented by four boards in a row, closes the game. However the winner is the richest gold-digger, a player with the most collected golden nuggets after the final VP count with possible penalties. <br/>The strategy and tactical decisions are made upon open information only.  The depth of pre-planning can lead to overwhelming dimension as well as it can be taken as a no rush family friendly play-style.<br/><br/>The second game variant offers exploding fun and whole different player&rsquo;s interaction. Being quick and cool headed, knowing a landscape to claim is a sure way, still outsmarting or bluffing the others might help in some cases! <br/>Winner is an experienced and ambitious gold-beater with the most popularity points for a council seat. Popularity is in relation to four down-town VIPs such as brothel madam, sheriff, mayor and horse trader. Each round player has a set of 10 unique tetris shape claim tokens to place them onto his set of four landscape boards. This happens in a race that starts with uncovering a random request card for this turn.<br/> The only closed information is the one before the moment of truth, when the picky requests of celebrities shall be satisfied. How well did you dig for them? Your popularity in four tracks may rise as well as it can fall by not following the exactions for gold and rubies.<br/><br/>Via the title Klondike 1896 players are looping back in time to meet one of the earliest and never before published creations of Vladim&iacute;r Such&yacute; presented by StragooGames (SGG).<br/><br/>",

Players take on the roles of various monsters from horror movie lore, and compete for the most prized victims &ndash; when the sun rises, the player with the most total point&rsquo;s worth of victims wins!<br/><br/>Create a stack of six &quot;victim cards&quot; and compete to kill the top victim card in each of the six rounds by creating a gruesome tale with your murder cards explaining what you intend to do to said victim.  Story cards numbered 1 to 6 that describe just how you intend to pummel them to death and with what, where, your ritual, when you'll stop the pummeling, and why you finally decide they're dead.  But as you weave your tale other players might add on to you story with frustrating &quot;But&quot; cards that nullify part of your plan.  Every time you play a card, you must read the entire story aloud which is really where this game shines, however other than a good laugh, the story you weave is irreverent for the victory, as the player with the most cards (1 thru 6, only one of each number may be in play per player) claims the victim. Different victims have different points, and and the end victim points are added up to see who wins the game.<br/><br/>Look it's a cheerleader, I'm going to skin her, with a chainsaw, in a creepy motel, while laughing maniacally, until the prophecy is complete, because she knows too much.

It was silver (but not only) transport from North America (It usualy starts from Cuba) to Spain. From 10.635 ships, about 3000 didn't reach the destination country. Players who commands one of the English fleet or one  of the pirates as well, have to take care to make this 3000 even greater.<br/><br/>During the game players will simulate cannon attacks and boarding attacks. After this they could blew up the ship, steal a silver or even steal all ship. Except that, players will have to watch out the wind, shallows, shipwrecks, luck and of course other players. Commanders will need to make alliances, then maybe broke alliances.<br/><br/>Game is parted on subgames, stages and turns. Subgame is ended when all Spanish ships move to the eastern edge of the map (or noone survive) and leave the it. Flagship have to be the last that will leave the map. <br/>Stages includes: <br/>- determining the strength and direction of the wind, <br/>- moving wrecks,<br/>- turns of players<br/>Turn includes:<br/>- moving ships,<br/>- shooting (cannons),<br/>- raming,<br/>- moving sailors,<br/>- declaring of abordage and fight,<br/>- transshipment of silver and cannons<br/>After each subgame players earn money, they can buy/repair/sell their ships, buy/sell cannons and sailors, buy a shipyard and/or a foundry.<br/>After 3 or 4 subgames, a player with the most money at the end will win. You can't sell your ships after last subgame.<br/><br/>2 modes of the game: <br/>I. For beginners:<br/>- each player owns 4 ships: 2 warships and 2 transport ships, he uses 2 warships and 1 transporter in each subgame<br/>- no matter where cannons are placed, they shoot in each direction<br/>II. Standard<br/>- all options<br/><br/>Class of ships are: galleon, karraka, frigate, brigantine, caravel, sloop, pinnace.<br/><br/>In 2 player game, one is Spaniard Don Enrique Pasadena, and a second one is British Sir John Elmeth. If playing 3 or more players, other playable characters are: Blanco Mendez Sidonia (Spain), Humphrey Pleensy (England), and 4 pirates: Francis Hampshire, Earth Discaster, Paul Delacroix, Giulio Leppo.<br/><br/>Plastic ships included.<br/><br/>",

This set can be played by itself, or mixed in with other editions.<br/><br/>Management Material is a card game with a corporate theme where the players try to win by avoiding being promoted to management.  This is done by playing Excuse cards to avoid the Project cards and passing the Project to the next player.  Other players may also play Recognition cards on you, which make it more difficult to get out of the project with an Excuse.  Ultimately, some player will end up completing the Project, and that player adds the card to their completed projects, pushing them closer to the 30 points necessary to be identified as Management Material and losing the game.  The last player that avoids being promoted to management wins the game.  Event cards provide an additional randomizing element.<br/><br/>",

Players place one of their cards in front of themselves, and this continues until the hand ends.

The German defenses were organized in depth, and consisted of powerful permanent fortifications, a series of trench lines and anti-tank ditches, artillery emplacements, etc. In addition, the terrain was difficult, laced with lakes, rivers, marshes and canals.<br/><br/>The two attacking Soviet fronts mustered between them some 3,800 tanks and assault guns, 25,000 artillery pieces, 3,00 aircraft and 1.2 million assault troops. Opposing them were 780,000 Germans, with 8,200 cannon, 700 to 800 tanks, and about 775 planes. Bolstering the defense were such elite units as the Hermann Goering and Gross Deutschland Divisions.

Screenwriters &mdash; often working in teams &mdash; try desperately to get a foot in the door, to land a meeting with a powerful film executive. So many screenwriters are knocking on the door, but big breaks are one-in-a-million.<br/><br/>Million Dollar Script takes place in a lavish Hollywood office. Through extensive market research, the studio has identified the perfect hero, as well as an equally perfect villain counterpart in order to make them millions. But beyond that, these bigwigs aren't taking any chances; they're going to be following that tried-and-true structure of nearly every record-breaking blockbuster of the past forty years. This film will be one of the greats like Star Wars, The Lord of the Rings, The Avengers, and Titanic.<br/><br/>Two writing teams have been invited to pitch their finest most preeminent ideas to a studio executive, a.k.a. &quot;the Exec&quot;. During the meeting, both teams are working on the same movie, pitching their ideas for each of the five traditional story events. Each round the Exec picks the pitch they prefer, which then becomes part of the shared storyline. The losing pitch gets discarded and treated as if it never existed, much like what should have happened to Battlefield Earth: A Saga of the Year 3000.<br/><br/>Each team of screenwriters is trying to nudge its way into the good graces of the Exec by winning the majority of the five rounds and scoring points in order to secure the profitable writing deal for themselves.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

At the beginning each player gets 8-10 cards, depending on the number of players. Turn after turn he can get new cards, but must also put cards into the discard pile. If one player has enough parts to put a motorcycle together, he knocks on the table, if it is his turn. Now all players can draw one more card before phase 2 of the game begins. Successively the players lay out a motorcycle, normally the smallest possible combination. A motorcycle consists of a front wheel, an engine and a rear wheel with the gear change. Then the knocking player begins and plays one of his cards. This can be done in four ways. If possible, one can attach another card to the motorcycle; one may also exchange a card of the owned motorcycle and put the exchanged card on the discard pile. And a player might also put a covered card on the discard pile, if he has no more use for it. Apart from that players can play cards against other players to bug other players, if the target player does not have a defense card.<br/>When all cards have been played, players count the points they get for their motorcycles (HP multiplied with the amount of gear shifts(rear tire) and front tire). The HP is entered in a block, and a new round begins. After 10 rounds the player with the highest total score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mau Mau Extreme takes the basics of Mau Mau &ndash; that is, playing cards from your hand to match the top card of the discard pile in order to empty your hand first &ndash; and turns up the challenge by introducing a buzzer and speed elements.<br/><br/>The gist of the game remains the same as the original: Players receive a hand of seven cards from a deck of sixty, and one card is place face-up to start a discard pile. On a turn, the active player discards a card that matches either in number or color the card on top of the discard pile. If a player can't legally play, she must draw a card; if she can play this card, she may do so. Playing a +2 card forces the next player to draw two cards before playing as normal, while playing &quot;Aussetzen!&quot; skips the next player's turn.<br/><br/>New gameplay elements in Mau Mau Extreme include an out-of-turn playing option. If you have a card in hand that matches the top card of the discard pile in both color and suit and you can buzz before the next player goes, you can play this duplicate card immediately. Four types of violet cards can be played on top of anything, and they either give you another turn immediately, force everyone to draw one card, force your left- and right-hand to race for the buzzer (with the slower player drawing a card as a penalty), or force everyone to race for the buzzer!<br/><br/>Empty your hand first, and you win a chip. The first player to collect three chips wins the game.<br/><br/>A variant for masochists or those who just like to buzz a lot has you paying attention to the back of the cards as well, as each back features 1-4 colored buttons that match the colors of the main suits. After a person draws a card, if one of the buttons on the newly revealed card matches the color of the top card on the discard pile, players must race to hit the buzzer, with the last player to do so drawing a penalty card.<br/><br/>Reimplements<br/><br/><br/>     Crazy Eights<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is based on the events surrounding the Blizzard of '77, which hit Buffalo, NY, in January of that year.<br/><br/>To win the game, you must be the first to complete your day's activities on the day of the blizzard.  Travel is easy at first, but the weather warnings pile up. When the blizzard hits, flip the board to the &quot;Blizzard&quot; side, where nearly every space contains an obstacle!<br/><br/>This game features a double-sided board (Sunny Side and Blizzard Size) and weather cards that recount some of the actual events of the 1977 blizzard.  The game was reworked for many other cities, including: Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Chicago, Cincinnati, Milwaukee, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Syracuse, Rochester, Providence, and Boston.<br/><br/>",

The pieces start off the board and may enter the board edge closest to the player; the game board is a 5x5 grid with the corners removed. On a turn, roll the die and use the result as movement points: it takes 1/2/3 points to move a small/medium/large piece one square, and twice that for a diagonal move. Stacking is not allowed, but if you land on an enemy piece of the same size or smaller, it is removed from the board and needs to be moved back on. To win, a player must get all of his pieces in a row of three squares centered in the board.<br/><br/>Also included in the 2012 edition of Treehouse, and Pyramid Arcade.<br/><br/>",

At the Munich International Horticultural Exposition 1983 it was first offered as a board game designed by Vester information pavilion of the Bavarian Ministry of the Environment. In 1984  Ravensburger launched &Ouml;kolopoly for the general market. While the magazine version had used marker stones on the tables, the final version used adjustable dials. Later a computer version was developed and published under the title ecopolicy. (Source: Wikipedia, <a target='_blank' href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96kolopoly\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%96kolopoly</a> )<br/><br/>OVERVIEW<br/><br/>An attempt to turn an ecological/economic/sociological computer simulation into a board game. Since 1993, players can choose between two scenarios: &quot;Kybernetien&quot; is an industrial nation, &quot;Kyborien&quot; a developing country.<br/><br/>One or more players adjust 9 wheels each turn, representing current conditions. Settings influence each other as well. E.g. high &quot;production&quot; increases &quot;waste&quot;, which in turn decreases &quot;standard of living&quot;, which in turn decreases &quot;action points&quot; (political acceptance) for the next round.<br/><br/>Goal is to guarantee stable conditions, but often the game ends in disaster. Optionally, the game can be played with event cards (good and bad).<br/><br/>",

The main difference is that the Polish version supports the game from 2 to 5 players, while Eleminis is playable up to 8 players. There is also a smaller variety of action cards.<br/><br/>Moreover the theme is completely new. Superbohaterowie in Polish language means Superheroes.<br/><br/>Your goal in this game is to collect one of each of five superheroes in your city on the table. Players each have five slots available to them, and each slot can hold one card. On a turn, you draw a card from the deck then either play it in a row (if it's a superhero card) or use it (if it's an action).<br/><br/>Each superhero outranks two other superheros, similar to rock/paper/scissors/Spock/lizard. You can play a superhero card you draw in any empty space or replace a weaker superhero with the new one; you can play in your row or an opponent's. A star superhero is wild and can represent any superhero you need; a giant spider card can replace any element and can be displaced only by a star superhero or an action card.<br/><br/>The actions let you discard cards in play, move cards, swap them. There are no cards which let you to lose your turn or reverse the turn order (which are in the Eleminis). Play continues until someone collects one superhero of each type in his city.<br/><br/>",

In the historical battle, the US Second Marine Division had 3 days to clear the island of Japanese soldiers.  The bloody battle inflicted nearly 3,000 casualties on the Marines; only 17 of 4,700 Japanese soldiers survived.  The solitaire game places the player in command of the US forces to determine how he performs compared to the historical outcome.<br/><br/>A map overlaid with a hexagonal grid forms the game's playing field.  In the middle lies the isle of Tarawa, surrounded by water.  The terrain and Japanese defenses are also printed out, as well as the US-designated landing beaches.  Each turn, the player receives an amount of forces to deploy onto the beaches.  He handles attacks between the two armies, rolling dice and checking tables to resolve their effects.  When the Marines has defeated the Japanese in a hex, a cleared marker is placed on it (and removed if the US forces retreat from the hex due to a counterattack).  If the Japanese attack is particularly effective, the Marines suffers casualties, which is reflected by moving a marker on the Casualty Track.  The player also has to concern him with Booby-Traps, Snipers, Air Raids, Morale, and Supply.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of the third turn.  The player wins if all hexes of the island are cleared and the Casualty Track reflects less than 5,000 casualties.<br/><br/>",

On your turn, you can move one of your pieces into a neighboring space either straight or diagonally. Whenever a piece is moved into another space where the opponent's piece is already located, the pieces fight. In that case the attacking player reveals the card that controls the column where the attack originated, and the defender reveals the card of the column the piece is located. The high card wins, with the losing piece being removed from the board. The used cards are removed and replaced with new cards from each player's own shuffled deck.<br/><br/>Two of the cards have special powers. When moving a piece in the column of a 0 card, you can scout a single card of your opponent, after which you discard the 0 card, and replace it with a new card. Whenever the piece in the column of a 1 card is defending against a stronger card, the piece evades the attack and the two pieces change places.<br/><br/>",

It includes background on gods, limited magic (from gods or magic places), sample races, and pre-generated characters from the Argonauts (the game is clearly aimed at reproducing the feel of the movie Jason and the Argonauts).  It uses a skill-based system, with point-bought character creation.  There are three combat systems: Noble (i.e. dueling), Melee, and Naval.  They are fairly complex, although Melee is fairly fast.<br/><br/>(Entry extracted in part from the RPG Encyclopedia, <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.darkshire.org/~jhkim/rpg/encyclopedia/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.darkshire.org/~jhkim/rpg/encyclopedia/</a>)<br/><br/>There was a second edition in 1983.

Each cube that matches a cube of the previous performing artist is worth 1 point, but each cube that doesn't match is worth 2 points. The spectators like variety after all! In addition, each round the poster cards will determine which kind of artist is worth some bonus points.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players will send any remaining artists for one final performance and score extra points based on how good (upgraded) they are.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game comes from Californian Products, a company that was founded in 1975 but has only recently, with Cranium, entered the toy and game market. New Amici has set as its goal to tune up people's often only limited knowledge of foreign languages, so that players can make new friends when on vacation abroad.<br/><br/>Up to four teams / solo players in two different nationalities take part, independent of language knowledge or age. By virtue of three difficulty levels, played in parallel, even novices can stand a chance against advanced speakers and learn the basics of the language along the way. The game works in two directions: people that normally speak German, for example, but wish to learn English can play the English-German version with English speakers who wish to learn German. Both profit from each other. But even players who all have the same mother tongue can play. The correct pronunciation of words in foreign languages is no problem, as New Amici uses a unique phonetic system that doesn't require any advance knowledge. Unlike the dictionaries, the words are spelled using 'normal' alphabet letters instead of phonetic symbols.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to win cards over three rounds. This is accomplished by translating cards in both the mother tongue as well as the foreign language. Novices have to translate simple words, advanced players have to translate tougher cards. In addition to vocabulary know-how, New Amici also provides information about countries and peoples. In addition to words, sentences and idiomatic expressions, there are also cards with information about culture, business, as well as food and drink. The next rounds begins after seven cards have been won. The winner is the player who, in the finals, translates all of the played cards error-free.<br/><br/>The game has sold over 42,000 copies in Norway. In Germany, it is being distributed through toy stores, department stores, as well as book stores. Thus far, four versions are available for the suggested retail price of 39.90 Euros: German-English, German-French, German-Spanish, German-Italian. A German-Norweigan version is already available in Norway and should be available in Germany soon.<br/><br/>In The Netherlands it was also available in four versions: Dutch-English, French, Spanish and Italian. A Dutch-German version was made by Hueber Verlag GmbH &amp; Co. KG.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thrills and and chills await in Pittsburgh 68, a frenzied game of zombie horror! One player starts as a zombie and the rest as survivors on the run. As survivors are eliminated, they become part of the growing zombie problem. Those who avoid becoming zombified are the &quot;winners&quot;, but only if they survive the final draw!<br/><br/>The game is played in four segments called &quot;reels&quot;. Each reel has a designated number of cards to be played through. As these are revealed in a central three-card hand, players have the option to take them on their turn to build their survivor or zombie hands. In addition to cards, the Shuffling Horror system uses two six-sided dice (2d6) to resolve conflict actions, such as when a zombie attacks a survivor. The game includes two sets of dice. The Zombie Master makes many dice rolls and reserves one set as his own, while the players should pass their set as each player completes her turn.<br/><br/>Spoints &ndash; short for survivor points &ndash; are the final component of the Shuffling Horror system. These counters track the survivors' vitality and luck, and survivors use spoints to cheat the system.<br/><br/>Pittsburgh 68 is a game that revels in zombie mayhem. As such, its outcome varies greatly. Our advice is to just let the zombies run amuck.<br/><br/>Well...not quite run...<br/><br/>Shuffle.<br/><br/>",

In order to help their children, their parents start buying houses, vans and cars. However, their children have strong colour preferences, and also like their houses and vehicles to be colour-coordinated.<br/><br/>Each of the three to six players takes the role of one family, and aims to be the first to set up all their children for their adult life. This will involve repainting houses, repainting garages, buying and exchanging vans and cars, until your children are happily installed in their new homes.<br/><br/>Chelsea is a simple, yet thought provoking game, which teaches children to plan a strategy and follow it through in order to succeed. Because it only has a small amount of luck, children are rewarded for good play, and thus encouraged to think about what they are doing. But most importantly, because Chelsea is a game which teaches, rather than a teaching aid disguised as a game, children will enjoy it, and play it again and again.<br/><br/>[Note] The emphasis on children as the target audience for this game does it a serious a dis-service &amp; kills its appeal to a gamer. This is a fine light filler &amp; suitable for adults to enjoy.[/Note]<br/><br/>",

The players are the USA and the APU (Asian-Polish Union). The object is of course to destroy your opponent's satellites and such...<br/><br/>The author wrote: &quot;I had planned a Strategic Orbit War game where the goal is for players to explore, colonize, and mine the solar system. So I envisioned one big map showing the planets orbiting around, then a bunch of little maps showing the players' satellites orbiting the different planets, trying to blow the other guy's satellites out of orbit so they can claim the natural resources of that planet for themselves. Alas, with Orbit War failing, Strategic Orbit War never came to pass either.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle Spirits Saga is a strategic trading card game based on the original Battle Spirits, a game which has been attracting fans in Japan for over fifteen years. Since its launch in March 2023, this remake, which includes all new text and designs intended for the American and European markets, has seen the release of three card sets: Dawn of History, False Gods, and Aquatic Invaders. In July of 2023, the first Battle Spirits Saga Pro Tour event was held, and next year competitors from around the world will be gathering at the World Championship, which is scheduled to take place in January 2024.<br/><br/>The World Within<br/><br/>The world of Battle Spirits Saga is made up of six separate realms, each with its own unique color. Red, the Realm of Flame, is a land of plentiful volcanoes and has dragons soaring overhead. Purple, the Realm of Gloom, is inhabited by demons and undead, which lurk among the numerous gravestones. Yellow, the Realm of Radiance, appears as an earthly paradise for the many cute creatures who frolic about under the watchful eye of beautiful angels. White, the Realm of Frost, is where the mechanized denizens traverse back and forth across vast, snowy plains. Green, the Realm of Forest, has an overabundance of birds and giant beasts, which live within its lush forests. And finally, blue, the Realm of Water, provides a home to rowdy buccaneers who spend their days brawling in its many seaports.<br/>Despite all of their uniquely distinctive cultures and ideals, the birth of a unified empire managed to bring about an uneasy yet long-lasting harmony among these six otherwise unstable realms&mdash;until the day when mysterious bodies of energy known as soul cores began raining down from the heavens, marking the arrival of an entirely new era filled with chaos. Influential powers took advantage of the opportunities this chaos created, dividing and conquering the realms, and an even greater threat awoke from its sealed slumber to spread further disaster.<br/>The Starhavoc Age, named after those initial catastrophic rains, begins its story in Dawn of History, then continues on with False Gods and Aquatic Invaders, and finally arrives at its conclusion in this fourth booster set, Savior of Chaos.<br/>Siegwurm Nova returns to the battlefield in a new form that is nearly unrecognizable. Missing in action since the Realm of Gloom invaded, this hero from the Realm of Flame has come back to bring an end to the chaos. His unwavering spirit of generosity and the anger he feels toward those less scrupulous individuals meddling in world affairs is reflected in his card effects, which are sure to leave a lasting impression.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>A unique feature of Battle Spirits Saga is the core system that helps define its gameplay. Originally devised by Micheal Elliott, this system augments the cards used in the game with chips, which are referred to as cores. Players use the cores in their possession to pay card costs, which are printed on each of the cards they intend to play.<br/>There are three types of cards in Battle Spirits Saga: spirits, which you summon onto the field and then attack your enemy with; nexuses, which will improve your chances in battle when placed onto the field; and single-use magic cards, which possess powerful effects that will punish your opponent. You can reduce the cost of playing spirits and nexuses when you play more of them with the same color, and once they are on the field, placing cores onto these cards will raise their level, which increases attack strength and enables more powerful effects.<br/>In Battle Spirits Saga, games are generally won by repeatedly attacking your opponent with spirits until their life is reduced to zero. Both players maintain their lives with cores, and when that life is lost, those cores immediately turn into an exploitable resource. How effectively you manage the cores in your possession will end up being the key to winning or losing games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mighty Warriors was produced in the early 1990s by Games Workshop as part of a series of introductory-level miniatures games. The four-game series included Mighty Warriors, Ultra Marines, Kerrunch, and Space Fleet. The game includes dice, floor tiles, door stand-ups, 36 highly detailed Citadel Miniatures, and reference cards for army lists and spells.<br/><br/>In Mighty Warriors, players choose from either a band of Heroes or Skaven Ratmen. The Heroes are led by a Noble Knight, a Fearless Dwarf, and a Heroic Elf while the Skaven Ratmen are led by a Chaos Wizard and four Skaven Champions. The Elf and Chaos Wizard can cast spells. The other characters have differing combat abilities.<br/><br/>Players set up the castle from modular floor tiles, which are then connected by stand-up doors. The players then position their forces throughout the rooms of the castle. Finally a &ldquo;shield&rdquo; for each side is placed.<br/><br/>The game is played in phases including Magic, Movement, Missile Combat, Melee Combat, and Recovery from Stuns. Each player attacks the other while moving from one room of the castle to another. A player wins by capturing the opponent&rsquo;s shield.<br/><br/>This game is basically a &ldquo;light&rdquo; version of HeroQuest or Warhammer Quest, more of a skirmish style than exploration, Dungeon Crawl. The instructions state that the game is compatible with Ultra Marines so that players can have a fantasy versus science fiction battle.<br/><br/>Game Components<br/><br/>16 Skaven Warriors<br/>4 Skaven Champions<br/>12 Warriors<br/>1 Knight<br/>1 Elf<br/>1 Dwarf<br/>1 Chaos Wizard<br/>1 Heroic shield<br/>1 Chaos Shield<br/>20 Door Stands<br/>28 Black slotta Bases<br/>4 Green Slotta Bases<br/>4 Dice<br/><br/>Card Sheets:<br/>MW1 - Heroic Army List<br/>MW2 - Chaos Army List<br/>MW3 - Chaos Spell Scroll<br/>MW4 - Heroic Spell Scroll<br/>MW5 - Dungeon<br/>MW6 - Guard Room<br/>MW7 - Ancient Temple<br/>MW8 - Barracks<br/>MW9 - Wizards Study<br/>MW10 - Great Hall<br/>MW11 - Doors (7 vertical wood)<br/>MW12 - Doors (7 green vertical wood)<br/>MW13 - Doors (3 diagonal wood, 3 spiked vertical wood)<br/>MW14 - Library<br/>MW15 - Vampires Chamber<br/>MW16 - Treasure Room<br/>MW17 - Alchemists Laboratory<br/>MW18 - Dragon Chamber<br/>MW19 - Skaven Lair<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1814: Napoleon Buttonaparte and General Ludwig Von York Buttonburg wage a war without mercy, and a new battle is about to begin. The armies are deployed, awaiting orders to move, and in both headquarters the same speech is being presented: &quot;For you, Buttons, the goal is clear: End up on top!&quot; Soon the battle will commence, with each general trying to use the available spies as well as he possibly can to dominate the final battlefield.<br/><br/>As you might guess from the punny names, Button Up! is a non-serious look at combat during war &ndash; so non-serious, mind you, that the pieces are buttons, none of which are eliminated due to sucking chest wounds during play. In fact, Button Up! is an abstract game in which players try to manipulate the button troops to score more points than the opponent.<br/><br/>To set up each round of the game, randomly arrange nine buttons in a circle: three red for Buttonaparte, three black for Von York Buttonburg, and three neutral white spies. On a turn, the active player takes one stack that contains a spy, then distributes that stack clockwise one button at a time, with the buttons coming off the bottom of the stack as they're placed. Thus, the first move is a single white button being placed on its neighbor to the left; if that stack is moved on the second turn, the bottom button is placed on its left neighbor, then the white button on top placed to the left of that. If the last button placed matches color with the button it covers, the player who moved it takes another turn. (This doesn't apply if the stack being moved contains more buttons than remaining stacks; in this case, the final buttons are placed on the last stack without rearranging their order.)<br/><br/>When only one stack remains, the round ends. Each button has strength equal to its height in the stack; players sum their strength, and the player with the most strength earns points equal to the difference between the two sums. If one player now has 15 or more points, he wins; if not, shuffle the buttons and start another round with the player who has the fewest points going first.<br/><br/>",

Watch out, though, as the naughty pig intrudes again and again between other animals with a loud &quot;Oink!&quot;<br/><br/>In more detail, shuffle the ninety cards and deal them equally face-down to all players, who then takes turns drawing one card and playing it on top of a central pot. Should an animal be added to the pile while it's already the top card, players race to strike the table while woofing, baaing or otherwise making the sound of the animal depicted. Should the top two cards sum to 7, however, players must strike the table and &quot;Oink!&quot; at the same time. While the numbers on most animals range from 0-6, the pig has special rules, with a 7 on each card; thus, whenever a pig is placed on the pile, everyone must race to slap and oink as quickly as possible! Whenever a player correctly slaps the pile, she places the cards aside in a score pile; if incorrect, she must add a card from her deck to the discard pile (or scratch her head while making monkey noises, as the players prefer).<br/><br/>When all players run out of cards &mdash; or when at least one player is out and someone has claimed the pile &mdash; the game ends. Players then compare the height of their score piles to see who's claimed the most cards and won.<br/><br/>",

You, on the other hand, are more interested in old shipwrecks &mdash; more specifically, sunken Spanish galleons filled with gold. Time to embark on an old-fashioned underwater treasure hunt. What you didn't anticipate is that several of you have discovered the legends of these buried riches. To make matters worse, a barracuda is prowling through the shipwrecks.<br/><br/>The challenge in Barrakuda is to be the first player to have eight gold pieces in their vault, but before you can lock away gold in your vault, you need to find it on shipwrecks or steal it from others.<br/><br/>To set up the game, lay out shipwreck cards numbered 1-6 in some orthogonal arrangement, and give each player movement cards numbered 1-5, along with a barracuda card. On a turn, each player chooses a card from their hand, then they reveal them simultaneously. If you played a movement card, move your pawn to that shipwreck card; if you're the only player there (and the barracuda isn't), take both the special action and general action listed on the card. If more than one player is on the same shipwreck card, then whoever has the fewest movement cards in front of them has the initiative and can either take the special action or take all the gold from one player's bag; after this, all players take this card's general action.<br/><br/>If you're the only one who played a barracuda card, roll the distance die, then move it up to that many spaces in the direction of your choice. If a barracuda is on the same space as a player, they have to drop their gold on that shipwreck space; others can pick up that gold starting next turn. If none or more than one player play barracuda, roll the direction and distance card to determine where it goes.<br/><br/>Actions on cards let you pick up gold, move gold from your bag to your vault, protect you from the barracuda, take back movement cards, move the barracuda, and so on.<br/><br/>",

To win, you need to make sure they will also make it to the Festival to see you on stage &mdash; and won't get stuck in line at the toilet.<br/><br/>On your turn, play a movement card to visit new places or travel back to beloved festivals. Each tile represents a different landscape. The more often you visit a type of landscape, the more fans you will get there, i.e., meeples you place in a bag. On the night tiles, you get a chance to draw from the bag. Your fans will be invited to watch you play, whereas other bands' fans will be sent to queue for the toilet.<br/><br/>The game ends when all the tickets for the Festival are sold. The winning band is the one with the most fans on the floor.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Upon winning a battle, the winning creature can advance deeper into the ranks of the defending player's legion to strike at a new level of creatures.<br/><br/>One main feature of the game is that Chaotic cards all come with a unique code that the owner can use on a special website (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.chaoticgame.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.chaoticgame.com</a>) [closed as of 2018] to unlock a virtual version of that card.  In this way, the player is provided with a virtual copy of their entire card collection.  The other unique aspect is that the stats on each creature are random, so you may have multiple of the same card but unlikely that all stats are the same allowing for strategic advantages.<br/><br/>",

Will your Sailfish, with a Clownfish Tail, poisonous Lionfish pectoral fins, and Anglerfish Light Node, followed by a school of fish he commands, be the last Master Fish alive? Or will your Great White Shark, with the spiked skin of a Puffer Fish, over-sized brain, and regenerating heart be the last fish swimming by leaping from the water with its Flying Fish wings for a diving sneak attack?

A few modifications were made to adjust to the lack of a computer.<br/><br/>Players play on a 4x4 grid (play mat provided), with some spaces randomly blocked out during set-up by special extra cards.<br/><br/>Each card has a set of arrows, and a set of attributes.  The arrows point at one of the adjacent cards in the grid (four sides and four diagonals)  An arrow may be present or not, each card has a unique combination of arrows.  The attributes are: an attack value, whether the attack is physical or magical, and two defense values: one physical, and one magical.  There are a few other special cards.<br/><br/>Cards are played from a hand onto the game grid, and marked with a chip indicating the player.  If the new card has an arrow pointing at an existing card, and that card has no arrow pointing back, the other card changes owners.  If opposing arrows occur, then the cards 'battle' using their attributes.  Combat is resolved by comparing the attributes, looking up the value in a table, and then rolling the indicated percentile.  Winning a combat can create a chain reaction of ownership changes, based on the card arrows.<br/><br/>To my knowledge, the game was only published in Germany.<br/><br/>",

Is a musictherapy the right treatment for the vegetarian cat? Show that you have the courage, the right tactics and the necessary pinch of luck to become the chief physician .....<br/><br/>You work as veterinarians in a nutty pet clinic. The animals there are not really ill but<br/>a little strange. The patients cards show how many therapy points are needed to heal the patients. To gather therapy points you have to deal with the strange therapies in the nutty pet clinic.<br/><br/>Every therapy card is worth at least one therapy point. In order to cure your animal patients it requires a lot of therapy cards. Therapy cards are uncovered one after the other and placed in a row. Whoever thinks that enough therapy cards are displayed places his doctor figure below the last uncovered therapy card, since as soon as a second therapy card of the same kind is uncovered, chaos breaks out in the nutty pet clinic, ending this phase of the game immediately. Whoever has placed his doctor figure in time receives one therapy point for every uncovered therapy card up to his doctors figure, the others are left empty-handed.<br/><br/>To gather a larger amount of therapy points, the players have to use the special functions of the clinic rooms on the gameboard. Having gathered enough therapy points the players place their feeding bowls in clinic rooms. With the feeding bowls the players gather more therapy points so that they can cure the stranger patients. <br/>So it's up to the players to seek a career in the nutty pet clinic and reach the upper clinic floors.<br/><br/>Action cards allow special actions and provide surprising events. The player who cures many patients and thus collects most victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Clontarf, is a grand tactical simulation of The Battle of Clontarf that took place on 23 April 1014 at Clontarf, near Dublin, on the east coast of Ireland. It pitted the forces of Brian Boru, high king of Ireland, against a Norse-Irish alliance comprising the forces of Sigtrygg Silkbeard, king of Dublin, M&aacute;el M&oacute;rda mac Murchada, king of Leinster, and a Viking contingent led by Sigurd of Orkney and Brodir of Mann. It lasted from sunrise to sunset, and ended in a rout of the Viking and Leinster forces. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 10,000 men were killed. Although Brian's forces were victorious, Brian himself was killed, as were his son Murchad and his grandson Toirdelbach. Leinster king M&aacute;el M&oacute;rda and Viking leaders Sigurd and Brodir were also slain.<br/><br/>Game from Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #162 (along with Saipan) depicting a long forgotten but interesting subject. Game of the clash between the invading viking and the Irish forces under Brian Boro.<br/><br/>Little is known on this battle and the designer has admittedly researched as best he could. However, the game is of original design and is quite bloody in its combat table, well in keeping with the era.  Nicely produced map and counters,depicting the area of the battle, with counters in the traditional green for you know who and blue for the vikings and their allies. The game is based on kill or be killed, with little room for maneuver... and would suit most medieval wargamers to a tee.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 30 minutes<br/>Map: 130 yards per hex<br/>Unit: Individual Leaders and 300-500 men per combat counter<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; (Clontarf uses only half of the map as the other half is for Saipan)<br/>One countersheet (200 1/2&quot; dual-side printed counters, 100 for Saipan and 100 for Clontarf)<br/>One 10 page rulebook<br/><br/>",

It's a party game of luck and strategy where you will cheat, steal, bother and disrupt the lives of your opponents. There is no honor among pirates! There is no elimination, that is, who enters the game stays until the end and everyone has a chance to win.<br/><br/>Butim is a card game that tells the story of the Bloody Islands Archipelago. These islands were used by generations of pirates to hide the biggest secrets that sailed the 7 seas. But all the pirates who buried their treasures there, also armed the most terrible traps so that these treasures stay properly protected. It was a beautiful and deadly place. However, as every story has an end, on a beautiful day a mysterious maelstrom opened near the islands and is leaching the islands with all this wealth to the bottom of the ocean. The objective of the game is to remove as many treasures as possible from these islands before they vanish forever. The player who has more wealth at the end of the game is declared the winner.<br/><br/>During the game you draw resources and cards, dig the islands (draw island cards) looking for maps and treasures and play special cards. At the end of a round cards are removed from the islands to the maelstrom. The game ends when a number of islands were totally removed.<br/><br/>",

The game is pretty much the same as the standard Trivial Pursuit games, yet has a more diverse and advanced questions set.<br/><br/>Every player starts with an empty play piece and has to fill up his piece with 6 different coloured parts by answering questions in the headquarters of 6 categories (geography, entertainment, history, art &amp; literature, science &amp; nature and sports &amp; leisure). To get to the headquarters the players roll dice, advancing on a path and answering questions of the corresponding category. If the answer is correct, the player plays again. If not, the next player takes his/her turn.<br/><br/>The first player to fill up on pieces has to return to the center of the board for a final test. If he/she succeeds, he/she wins the game.<br/><br/>",

This may appear to be a wargame, but there are numerous roads to victory, as the use of trade and economic advancement is just as likely to prevail, in the end, as territorial expansion and conquest.<br/>Imperator includes 15 scenarios set from 1700 BC to 1200 AD.  Each is very different and all are playable by between 1 and 5 players, with ingenious rules to take care of the &quot;neutral&quot; powers; those that aren't being played by a real-life player.  Very suitable for solitaire play, as well as being interesting for multiple players, you'll even take in a bit of history to boot!  The game is played in Seasons, and each season brings its own challenges.  Unique features such as pleas for &quot;Divine Intervention&quot; and &quot;Royal Marriages&quot; make the game that little bit different.<br/><br/>This game is a reimplementation of King of Kings, replacing the hex-based map with area movement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As seen on Board Game Arena.<br/><br/>Remember When ... is a family party game for 3-9 players, ages 8 and up.  Younger readers are also able to play, as the game is very educational for teaching sentence structure and increasing vocabulary, while being fun at the same time!<br/><br/>The players represent retired super heroes and reformed super villains who have gotten together, years later, to reminisce about their earlier adventures.  However, as always happens at occasions like this, each is trying to outdo their peers by bragging about an even more amazing story of what they once did.  But the funny part is that everyone's memories are faulty because they are now going senile, and they're relying on their &quot;friends&quot; to help them fill in the blanks!  So while the hero or villain might really have a great story to tell, what comes out of their mouth ends up being VERY different.  Each player has two goals - 1) To be the best at helping the other players in remembering correctly, and 2) To come up with their own memory/adventure that their peers agree is the best one of all!<br/><br/>Remember When ... comes with hundreds of unique cards, each with 4 words/phrases on it's 4 sides.  There are ZERO repeats, meaning there are billions of different combinations!  There are also several blank cards for players to create their own.  On the Active Player's turn they are creating a memory with 7 or 8 (if using the optional Orange cards) different cards representing a different part of the memory.  1) WHEN they did this, 2) WHERE they did this, 3) HOW they did this (i.e. Adverb), 4) The ACTION that they took (i.e. Verb), 5) The DESCRIPTION of the object of their memory (i.e. Adjective), 6) The OBJECT of their memory (i.e. Noun), and 7) WHY they took this action.  For example, &quot;Remember When ..., while looking for my other sock, in the crowded grocery store, I repeatedly kissed the furry caveman because the Great Conjunction was at hand!?&quot;<br/><br/>But the Active Player does not create this Sentence/Memory from their own cards.  The other players are rapidly trying to assist the Active Player by submitting one card each.  The Object and the Action Taken are determined first and read out loud, so the players have some context for their card submissions.  Once one card of a type/color (i.e. &quot;Blue&quot;) has been submitted then another available color must be submitted.  As the players submit their cards to the Active Player, face down, they are trying to guess which of those 4 words/phrases the Active Player will actually choose.  If they are correct in their guesses then both they and the Active Player will get points for matching.<br/><br/>Once the Active Player has assembled their sentence, scored it for &quot;helping points&quot;, then they read the completed sentence aloud (we suggest as dramatically as possible).  This is because the other players will be voting on which memory of the evening is the most exciting of all!<br/><br/>Also try the game out FOR FREE online at Board Game Arena!<br/><br/>",

Players are divided into teams, and then each team will take turns: one player has one minute to explain as many words as possible while the other team members try to guess them quickly to gain more points. Words will be worth more or less points depending on their difficulty, as they could be anything from ordinary objects to entire phrases.<br/><br/>In addition, the team can use special cards that can change the entire course of the game. These &quot;U-cards&quot; can be played before the player begins explaining words, and include abilities such as:<br/>- &quot;First letter&quot;: You are allowed to say the first letter of the word;<br/>- &quot;Additional minute&quot;: You are given one additional minute to explain;<br/>- &quot;Replace a player&quot;: You can change the player who is going to explain the words - this lets competing teams gain an advantage by preventing good players from participating. <br/>- &quot;With closed eyes&quot;  - Have you ever tried to explain something without seeing others?<br/>- &quot;Robbery&quot;: You can guess the word of another team and steal their points<br/><br/>The game contains 200 cards with words.  Each card has 10 tasks, so the game comes with 2,000 words and phrases.<br/><br/>",

Next, each player chooses one card from their hand, then reveal them simultaneously; if an odd number of revealed cards have a time symbol, flip over the time card. Then repeat this process, with each player choosing, then revealing another card from their hand, flipping over the time card again if an odd number of revealed cards have the time symbol.<br/><br/>Now determine who won the round: If the time card shows the sun, the color with the highest visible sum among visible cards (which includes the first card revealed) is the winning color; if the time card shows the moon, then the color with the lowest sum wins. All players who have played at least one card in the winning color now collect any visible card and place it in front of them. Remove all the remaining cards from play, deal two cards to each player, then start the next round.<br/><br/>When the deck has no cards in it, the game ends, and players tally their score based on the number of stars on cards in front of them.

An unknown member of the team has been infected by an alien entity and will sabotage and infect the researchers as they try and build a satellite array to contact mission control. Will you survive? Are your friends infected by an alien entity? Can you contact mission control before its too late? Grab some friends and join the paranoia.<br/><br/>Alien Entity is meant to be played multiple times. Players are passed cards face down to determine who is playing as a human or an alien. The humans win if the satellite array is built or the alien gets shot. The alien wins if it passes out infection cards to all of the humans. After each game ends, points are calculated and another game starts with a new random person as the Alien.<br/><br/>Each player draws cards from a central pile and takes turns playing and passing cards. Choose wisely because you will only be able to play one card per turn and equipment such as body armor only lasts until your next turn.You may pass cards face down to other players to either help them or hurt their progress. If you are a human you may want to pass parts of the satellite array to another human. If you are an alien you can pass infection cards to other players to get them on your side.<br/><br/>Games usually last between five and ten minutes. After each game points are given depending on the outcome of the game. The cards are then re-shuffled and a new alien player is secretly chosen. You can play until a player amasses 7 points or you can just play for fun indefinitely.<br/><br/>",

The pieces initially occupy the entire back row, i.e., the row of spaces nearest the controlling player.  As in shogi, the sides are called sente(&quot;black&quot;) and gote (&quot;white&quot;) with sente going first, but the colors associated with the names are purely conventional.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to be the first player to capture either five or eight of an opponent's pieces, as agreed upon before starting the game.  An opponent's piece is taken by custodial capture, i.e., by being sandwiched horizontally or vertically (but not diagonally) between a player's own pieces.  A piece must be moved into such a postion immediately on either side of an opponent's piece to make a capture, but multiple captures can be made simultaneously.  This occurs only if a piece is moved so that it causes more than one enemy piece to be positioned between the piece moved and another of the player's own pieces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arkham is a city under the constant threat of cosmic terror. Dark forces work behind the scenes to undermine the fabric of reality. One has the sense that if Arkham were to fall, it may spell the end of everything. But darkness has ways of being seen. The Ring of Shadows has been found, or maybe wanted to be found, at this critical hour. It's up to the citizens of the Miskatonic Valley to work together to wield its awful power to stop the end before it begins.<br/><br/>In Shadow of the Elder Gods, 1-4 players take on the roles of citizens of Arkham who work together to prevent cosmic horrors from unraveling reality. Shadow focuses on dealing with the consequences of dark forces conspiring against players, rather than combat. Players take turns spending actions to travel the streets of Arkham researching Knowledge, hiring Muscle, collecting Assets, and dealing with Threats.<br/><br/>Each game revolves around an inevitable danger to Arkham which is represented by the Threat Deck, a constructed deck of cards which players must survive in order to banish the Elder Threat and win the game. Each threat card features an Arkham face and a Shadow face. The Arkham faces represents the visible manifestations of the unseemly things found on the Shadow faces of the cards. Whenever the player with the Threat Start Marker begins their turn, a Threat token is placed on the current Threat Card and the indicated damage is dealt to players or locations. The first/last card represents the unique Elder Threat which players must contend with in order to win.<br/><br/>The player who possesses the Ring of Shadows is able to view the Shadow side of the Threat Deck and deal with the Threat at hand by using what resources they have, but they expose themselves and others to harm in the process. If players manage to survive their final encounter with the Elder Threat in the shadows, they unceremoniously save the world from incomprehensible danger. But such is the way in Shadow of the Elder Gods.<br/><br/>",

His accounts from the land was so overwhelmingly fantastic and adventurous, that one could hardly believe him. Yet, the precious cargo he brought with him, convinced even the most discriminating and suspicious among the Venezians.<br/><br/>Everyone wanted to have some of the valuable goods from China. Through the Silk Road &mdash; the legendary trading route which connected China with Europe &mdash;  traders brought exquisite treasures home, most importantly, precious silk,  which no one outside of China knew how to make.<br/><br/>But the road which led to Venezia through the Gobi desert and passing the great commercial centers of Xi'an, Samarkand, Buchara, Bagdad and Byzanz, was dangerous. This made the traders dependent on each other during the journey. Nevertheless this did not stop them from, using the right tactics and a trace of cunning, trying to gain advantages over each other. Especially in the Bazaars and at the large Trading Posts which lined the route. The first to arrive would make the most profitable deals and receive the most ounces of Silver when they arrived at the end of their trip.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Here's a description of the game from Cocktail Games:<br/><br/>Sky My Husband is a collaborative effort from Guillaume Blossier and Jean-Loup Chiflet. A while back, Guillaume showed us a prototype of a game in which players had to find English expressions through their literal French translations - averaging about two clues per phrase. This idea, highly innovative in terms of a game, went over very well in tests. We were reminded of the book &quot;Sky my Husband&quot;, which was based on a similar idea (it included literal French translations of English phrases) - and sold over 200,000 copies over the last 10 years. It seemed logical to us, then, to contact the book's author, Jean-Loup Chiflet. He was excited by the concept and helped us out greatly with the content, as well as getting permission from the book's publisher to use the same title.<br/><br/>In the game, 460 expressions, each with two clues, are read out by a player. The object of the game is to deduce the original English phrase the fastest. As an example, one English phrase is &quot;Tie-break&quot;. The literal French translation &quot;Repos de cravate&quot; (Resting tie) is provided, along with two clues: Tennis and Deciding Game.<br/><br/>",

You play as a visiting guest to Jurassica, an amazing island dinosaur resort.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the dinosaurs have escaped, leaving you and your friends to fight for survival!<br/><br/>Be the first player to win by finding power switches and restoring power to the park - all while scavenging for supplies and fighting off dangerous dinosaurs with improvised weapons!<br/><br/>Players choose who goes first - we suggest the youngest player.<br/>Make sure there are 3 power switches per player placed in the explore deck. After shuffling each deck separately, Arrange the 3 decks (Explore, Scavenge, Craft) face down on the table in a line next to each other.<br/><br/>The selected Player One goes first and remaining Players take turns in a clockwise direction. On your turn you can pick up 2 cards from the top of any deck. (Explore, Scavenge, Craft). You are allowed to pickup any deck of your choice, for example, 1 'Explore' card and 1 'Craft' card based on what you need.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to make your way through the 'Explore' deck and find 3 Power Switches that are hidden in the deck. The first player to do so wins the game.<br/><br/>Once you receive foe cards totaling -4 hit points, you cannot advance any further in the 'Explore' deck. You must then craft items picked up from the 'Craft' deck, to remove dinosaur cards cards, using scavenged materials from the 'Scavenge' deck.<br/><br/>There are also helpful cards scattered throughout each deck that are free to use once found. These are discarded once used.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A card game with a biblical theme on the eternal struggle between good and evil, light and darkness, about the imminent Apocalypse.<br/><br/>Apokalypsis is the Greek term, consisting of ap&ograve; (separation) and Nereids (hidden), from which comes the word Apocalypse. Lucifer opens his Wings of darkness while the Archangel Michael protects the host of blessed pious souls. The judgment day came. The Beast devours the last chimes while the souls of men are contested by unleashing the Four knights of the Apocalypse.<br/><br/>Apokalypsis is a biblical game for 3-6 players from the age of 13. As fallen angels, players will challenge themselves using the Knights of the Apocalypse, Events and Deadly Sins, reaping and stealing Souls before the last chime. Keep an eye on the position of Lucifer, the Beast and the Archangel Michael: like three hands of a terrifying clock, they move between light and darkness threatening the end of time. There is even the possibility that all players will lose the game, if the Archangel will be able to save more Souls, raising them to Heaven.<br/><br/>The game is designed by Jacopo Casiraghi, Andrea Vitagliano and Gianni Negrini. In order to treat the matter in a dignified way and avoid flattening its complexity, Apokalypsis was developed after a serious and thorough historical and philological research: in the rulebook a short compendium about the events described in the Apocalypse of John.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Another entry in Zoch Verlag's family of cute animal games, Wollmilchsau is a speedy reaction game in which you want to name the right animal on a turn &ndash; but which animal is right may be harder to determine than you think.<br/><br/>To set up, shuffle the deck of animal cards, then divide it into two face-up piles of cards; each card shows one of six animals: mouse, cat, dog, sheep, pig, or cow (from smallest to largest). Take one card from the top of one deck, and insert it face-down halfway through that deck.<br/><br/>All players compete at the same time. One player rolls a die that has one of the six animals on each face. The first player to yell out the name of the animal rolled will score &ndash; except if that animal is on one of the face-up cards; in this case, players must yell out one of the animals not visible on the top of the decks, with the first player doing so scoring &ndash; except for the final rule for animal calling, that being that the animal named correctly in the previous round cannot be called out in the current round, even if it would otherwise be correct. If two or more players yell an animal's name correctly at the same time, they all score. (The largest correct animal is the one that players cannot name in the subsequent round.)<br/><br/>If you score, you either:<br/><br/>    Take one card from the top of one face-up deck and place it in front of you, or<br/>    Turn all the face-up cards in front of you face down to make them safe.<br/><br/><br/>Safe for what, you may ask? If you call out an animal incorrectly, you must discard all face-up cards in front of you; if you have no face-up cards, then you must turn one safe card (if you have any) face up to put it at risk again.<br/><br/>Once the face-down card in the deck appears, you split this deck to create a third face-up pile, increasing the difficulty of the game. Once all the cards have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Olustee, is a simulation about The Battle of Olustee was fought on February 20, 1864, during the American Civil War. It was the only major battle fought in Florida during the war.<br/><br/>Union General Truman Seymour had landed troops at Jacksonville, aiming chiefly to disrupt Confederate food supply. Meeting little resistance, he proceeded towards the state capital of Tallahassee, against orders, assuming that he would face only the small Florida militia. Confederates in Charleston sent reinforcements under General Alfred H. Colquitt and the two armies collided near Olustee Station. The Union forces were repulsed and retreated to Jacksonville where they stayed for the remainder of the war.<br/><br/>Following the Florida, Atlantic and Gulf Central Railroad, Seymour led his 5,500 men in the direction of Lake City. At approximately 2:30 in the afternoon of February 20, the Union force approached General Finnegan's 5,000 Confederates entrenched near Olustee Station. Finnegan sent out an infantry brigade to meet Seymour's advance units and lure them into the Confederate entrenchments, but this plan went awry. The opposing forces met at Ocean Pond and the battle began. Seymour made the mistake of assuming he was once again facing Florida militia units he had previously routed with ease and committed his troops piecemeal into the battle. Finnegan and Seymour both reinforced their engaged units during the afternoon and the battle took place in open pine woods. The Union forces attacked but were savagely repulsed by withering barrages of rifle and cannon fire.<br/><br/>The battle raged throughout the afternoon until, as Finnegan committed the last of his reserves, the Union line broke and began to retreat. Finnegan did not exploit the retreat, allowing most of the fleeing Union forces to reach Jacksonville. However, the Confederates did make a final attempt to engage the rear element of Seymour's forces just before nightfall, but they were repulsed by elements of the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry Regiment and the 35th United States Colored Troops, both composed of black soldiers. The Confederate cavalry commander received criticism for failing to pursue the retreating Union forces.<br/><br/>Uses a slightly modified version of SPI's Blue &amp; Gray rules, called Battles of the American Civil War that started with Seven Days Battles.<br/><br/>Originally published by Decision Games (I) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #166, along with Savage Station.<br/><br/>Note: Some replacement counters for this game, and the rules necessary to use them, were included in S&amp;T 170: Atlanta Campaign.

Can you be the first to collect and stack fresh ingredients into a hoagie masterpieces before the Oogies, a gang of pesky, ingredient spoiling creatures, destroy your fixings?<br/><br/>Hoagie matches players in a goofy kitchen adventure to create the perfect sandwich while spoiling other players&rsquo; ingredients with the Oogies.<br/><br/>This family game is appropriate for players of all ages, from 8 and up. In Hoagie, the game designer developed a game that would be fun both for young children and parents, making this game a valuable part of any family game collection.<br/><br/>Hoagie is a card game. Players are dealt a hand of &quot;ingredient cards&quot; and a few &quot;action cards.&quot; Players attempt to build sandwiches by placing ingredient cards such as bread, cheese, meat, and lettuce in front of them, face up on the table, in order. Players may foul other players' ingredients by placing spoiled ingredient cards over opposing sandwiches. Action cards such as &quot;skip&quot; &quot;reverse&quot; and &quot;double-play&quot; add spice to the game.<br/><br/>The first player with an unspoiled hoagie sandwich on the table wins. This game is fast play and simple. Kids love it.<br/><br/>",

The results are the speeds at which the players may move their pawns. The players bid for these speed dice in a blind auction. Once all the speed dice have been distributed, the pawns are moved. After any movement, a check is made to see if your worker has kept his balance; if this check fails the coffee is spilled and one marker is lost. Play continues until a player crosses the end line.

The goal of the game remains the same: Create valuable combinations shown on the scoring sheet and collect more points than everyone else to win.<br/><br/>The deck consists of 108 cards, with the numbers 1-6 each appearing 18 times. Each player starts with a hand of five cards. On a turn, a player has two choices:<br/><br/><br/>     Discard 0-5 cards from your hand, then draw that many cards plus one from the deck. You can't have more than ten cards in hand.<br/>     Play five cards from hand, record your points on the score sheet, then refill your hand to five cards.<br/><br/><br/>In more detail, to score, you lay down five cards and score for one of the combinations on the score sheet: number of 1s, 2s, etc.; three- or four-of-a-kind; full house; small or large straight; Kniffel; etc. Write the score in the left-hand box of the appropriate line. You also lose 2 points for each other card in your hand, so note these penalty points in the right-hand box.<br/><br/>As soon as one player scores in all of the lines on his score sheet, players complete the round so that everyone has the same number of turns, then they tally their scores and subtract their penalties. Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The cards are divided out as follows:<br/><br/>48 GO cards - 4 set, of Green cards 1 through 12<br/>22 STOP cards - 1 set of red cards 1 through 12.<br/>1 set of red cards 1 through 10.<br/>20 TRANSFER cards - 1 set of yellow cards 1 through 12.<br/>1 set of yellow cards 5 through 12.<br/>4 TRANSFER PLUS cards - 1 set of yellow cards 1 through 4.<br/>6 DOUBLES cards<br/>8 LUCK PLUS cards<br/><br/>The object is to be the first player to eliminate all of your cards by matching cards and dice.  Each player is dealt 8 cards face up.  The remaining cards are stacked face down in the center of the table to form the draw pile. The top card of the draw pile is turned face up and placed next to the draw pile to form the match pile.  Each player will then try to get rid of as many cards as possible by matching the numbers on the cards with the numbers on the dice they roll.  There&rsquo;s a bit more to it than that, but you&rsquo;ll have to see the rules to get the whole picture.<br/><br/>",

The actual gameplay is similar to Risk, with players taking it in turns to produce units, move them and then perform combat by rolling dice. The twist, and the major way in which it differs from Risk, is in the different unit types.<br/>Land, Sea and Air forces may all be built, with differing movement and combat abilities. For example, air units move further and determine  first firer in combat, but cost more to build.<br/>In short, I would describe this game as &quot;Risk with attitude&quot;, and is definitely preferable to normal risk. It is less luck-based, due to special dice used for combat.<br/><br/>",

If they do not, the dungeon wins. But either way, there will be laughs and maybe even a drink or two!<br/><br/>Battles are resolved by players trying to drop quarters on coasters.  If they miss, players take hit damage.  If they land on the coaster, the monsters take damage.

Acquire resources, go on missions, build bases, resource stations, laboratories and roads and finally the game-winning water extraction station on the Martian North Pole!<br/><br/>Mission to Mars 2049 is a light weight strategic family board game that keeps a dynamic game pace from the beginning till the very end. You start with a single base on the outside of the map and gradually build you colony larger one base at a time until you reach the North Pole of Mars and build a road through the polar ice cap. The player who builds the water extraction station on the center of the map first, wins the game. In order to do that you will need lots of resources (air, food and minerals) which you can  acquire by building resource stations. Each time someone rolls that station on the game die, you get one card for each of the stations you have built for that resource.<br/><br/>To add extra strategies to the game, there are mission cards. Peaceful mission cards will allow you to play peacefully and get ahead by building your own colony and acquiring more resources. Aggressive mission cards will let you attack other players and try to stop them from winning. Knowing how to play with these cards will give you lots of strategic advantages during the game.<br/><br/>",

The players &ndash; in the role of recombinant DNA specialists perhaps &ndash; now need to shift the body parts to recreate the correct and complete original animals.<br/><br/>In Mucca Pazza (Italian for &quot;crazy cow&quot;), the head, body and legs of ten animals are shuffled, then placed on the three sliding rails of the game board. Ten animal chits are placed at random at the top of the game board. On a turn, a player has up to three sliding steps to recreate a particular animal; if he does, he claims any matching chits above the game board, then more chits are drawn so that ten are always available. These chits are worth one point each, and whoever scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>For younger players, you can use only half the game board, which holds parts for five animals. With this smaller board, a player can reassemble any animal with at most three sliding steps &ndash; but don't tell them that! Let the kiddos figure it out for themselves...<br/><br/>",

It had followed in the footsteps of the first expedition, but all its team disappeared without leaving a trace.<br/>In 1937 the millionaire philanthropist Alejo Crow begins investigating these strange occurrences.<br/>On board the battleship Gigamesh, following the geographic indications hidden in the Necronomicon, the Crow-Yutani Expedition, comprising a select group of explorers and a commando of clone soldiers known as &ldquo;macutes&rdquo;, must face the sinister creatures that await them in the polar ice.<br/>    <br/>// OBJECT OF THE GAME &not;<br/>A cooperative game in which players must try to survive the attack of primeval beings and kill all the monsters.

        "description": "Cooperative game for 2-4 players ages 8 and up.  The Watchtower space station is under attack by villains (5 per hero plus randomly-appearing extra-powerful &quot;ultra villains&quot;) and the players win by capturing them all before the Watchtower is destroyed.<br/><br/>The board consists of concentric rings in eight triangular sectors, with the station in the middle.  On each player's turn, they roll two dice: a standard 8-sider and custom 6-sider.  If the 6 shows a JLA logo the hero can move the 8-sider in spaces then attack.  Otherwise, the 6 will show icons for villain advancement towards the station, or new villains appearing on the outer ring, and then the player rolls again.  Thus, the villains will make totally random progress towards the station before each player's turn (and possibly even none at all).  The Watchtower can take four villain attacks before it's destroyed.<br/><br/>Hero attacks are straightforward; each villain has a numeric defense value, and each hero rolls two 8-siders against their villains (e.g., Superman vs. Bizarro) and one against others (e.g., Flash vs. Luthor).  Defense values range from 7 to 15, so it's unlikely for a hero to win without help.<br/><br/>Help comes in the form of allies and power cards.  Other heroes stacked with an attacking hero can roll their dice and add to the attack, greatly increasing the chance of success.  And power cards activate hero powers like moving other heroes (Superman, Flash), adding dice (Green Lantern) or allowing other heroes to play cards during your attack (Batman).  However, power cards are limited; each player starts with two and only draws a new one when defeating a villain.<br/><br/>Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Defend the Justice League satellite from a super-villain onslaught!<br/><br/>The most dangerous villains in the universe have combined forces to attack the Justice League satellite. In Justice League: Axis of Villains, you can play as Superman, Batman, Green Lantern, or The Flash, and team up to defeat them in a powered-up strategy game!<br/><br/>",

But standing in his way is an empire with vast resources, determined people, and a leader whose lust for power and ruthlessness could be Hitler's match. The Soviet Union rises to the challenge with great tenacity and a seemingly endless supply of soldiers willing to give their lives for the state. Can the Red Army overwhelm the Wehrmacht? Can the Luftwaffe hold the skies against the growing Red Air Force? Will Hitler or Stalin be victorious in the largest single battle-front in all of history? You make the orders, you choose the targets, and you reap the glorious victory or the final defeat!<br/><br/>Battlecards is a card game in which you and your opponent(s) build up forces and conduct battles in many of the<br/>great conflicts in history. This particular starter set deals with the Pacific Theater during World War II. The game consists of 154 card set. Based upon the draw of Conflict cards, players may build forces, learn about their opponent, gain a secret advantage, or enter into a battle. The objective is to be the player at the end of the game with the most victory points, or to win the battle for your opponent&rsquo;s homeland. In addition, 20-card expansion packs are available to improve the selection and capabilities of Arsenal cards and Conflict cards for this set. Additionally, this set can be combined with the other World War II Starter Sets so you and your friends may play the entire war as you please.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Unconditional Surrender&quot; was the wargame in issue #36 of The Wargamer Magazine dated December 1984.<br/><br/>The game simulates the Confederate counterattack on Fort Donelson after the Fort had been invested by U.S. Grant and the Union army in February 1862. The Confederate garrison actually outnumbered the Union troops 18,000 to 15,000, but Grant's judgement of his opponent's psychology served him well. The unconditional surrender of the fort on Febuary 16th, 1862, shattered the Confederate defenses in western and middle Tennessee.The equivalent of an entire corps was taken prisoner, and the Cumberland River was opened to the Union Navy. Within weeks Nashville would fall and the remaining Confederate forces would retreat into Mississippi. The victory made a national hero of it's previously unknown author, who here began his rise to command of all the Union armies - U.S. Grant. Yet the battle could have turned out much differently, and the controversy in later years over what really happened and why, would be among the most intense surrounding any action of the war.<br/><br/>",

To catch Geists, you need to lure them with an exact number of Zingiberi chips. These are earned by moving around the board and landing on numbered squares. The number lets you take or return a chip of that value, but also determined how far you will move next turn. A clever movement system encourages people to cheat and get away with it, or at least makes everyone watch closely. Each Geist, once captured, can also be use to &quot;prank&quot; other players, and this keeps things rowdy but also adds to the strategy. Chili Pepper cards also spice things up since the Geists don't usually like them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For Fame &amp; Fortune (F3) is an addictive card-drafting game of high stakes Fortune Hunting. The objective is to collect the best Fortune Hand from several rounds of drafting. The twist is that players control the number of cards to draft, points they score, and Fortune Hands they make through a common mechanism that leads to many strategic decisions and tactical plays.<br/><br/>Players begin with ten cards and starts by drafting five cards. Players will then play cards or pass. Each card they play will reduce the number of cards to be drafted next, as well as be the additional stakes of the player. The cards played will also form a common pool of cards that players can use to form the best Fortune Hand. Once four cards have been played, players can either play the fifth and final card or draw and discard a card.<br/><br/>The discarded card can be stolen by other players, so players have to be careful with discards and the ever-increasing stakes as the game progresses. Once the fifth card is played, the players will compare Fortune Hands and the winner will score points based on stakes played and a Fortune Modifier. The game ends after every player has a chance to deal, or after a pre-agreed number of rounds.<br/><br/>To excel in F3, you will need the cunning of a boardgame player, the opportunistic instincts of a Hold'em player, the tactical savvy of a Mahjong player, and the risk-taking skills of a Hanafuda player. The game's challenging scoring system provides many ways to score bonus points to showcase playing skills and abilities.<br/><br/>To win cautiously or attempt to shoot for the moon, your Fortune is in your hands!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In medieval Baghdad, a boy named Afumed was working for a general shop. There were many pots containing many kinds of items. His boss gave orders to sort the pots, but Afumed lost the tags on them. Before the boss comes back, he must sort all the pots.<br/><br/>In The Arabian Pots, you try to sort the pots by listening to the sounds they make when you shake them. The game includes three groups of three pots, with each group making a different sound when you shake it, as well as one pot that makes no sound.<br/><br/>For the basic game, your goal is to create a row of three pots that make the same sound. To set up, set aside the quiet pot, then place the other nine pots at random in the 3x3 grid of the game board. While all other players look away from the board, the first player swaps pairs of pots three times, not shaking them in the process. All of the other players make three swaps in a similar manner, then the game begins. On a turn, a player takes one of two actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Shake one of the pots.<br/>    Swap two pots in the same horizontal or vertical line, without shaking them in the process.<br/><br/><br/>If that player thinks a row contains pots that all have the same sound, yell &quot;Complete!&quot;, then shake the three pots to see whether the guess is correct. If so, the player wins; if not, that player loses their next turn and the game continues.<br/><br/>To use the quiet pot, during set up the first player replaces one of the regular pots with the quiet pot (without shaking anything), then does the pot swaps as usual. If someone shakes the quiet pot during the game, that player must then swap that pot with an adjacent pot while everyone else looks away from the board.<br/><br/>To play The Arabian Pots with people who are blind, announce which pots (1-9) you are shaking or moving. The notch in the game board indicates the bottom of the board.<br/><br/>As an alternate set-up, place the nine noisy pots on the board and the quiet pot to the side. Players then remove one pot at a time from the board, shaking them or not as desired, then place the pots in front of themselves. Place the quiet pot on #5, then take turns placing the pots on the board, leaving the final pot aside unshaken. Then play the game as normal except that whoever shakes the quiet pot must swap it with an adjacent pot (while others turn their back) and miss their next turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "UNO Madness is an implementation of the classic card game UNO with a mechanical gimmick.  The game is played on a spring-mounted tray.  After latching, the tray springs when a mechanical timer expires.  The tray has 24 slots lined in a spiral path; the final slot (in the centre) is labeled with the word UNO.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the tray is latched and the timer wound up.  Each player draws five tiles and keep their hand secret from the others.  The first player places a numbered tile in the first slot on the tray and starts the timer.  Continuing with the next player in sequence, the players follow the standard UNO rules in playing their tiles (color succeeds color, number succeeds number, draw when unable to play, etc).  They also have to say &quot;Madness&quot; to signify the end of their turn.<br/><br/>Play stops when a player has played his or her last tile, has played a tile on the last slot, or when the timer expires.  In the first two cases, the player records his score (according to UNO rules, summing up values of the tiles in other players' hands) and the game is reset (tiles reshuffled and redrawn, etc).  For the last case, everybody keeps their hand and the player who has yet to finish his or her turn when the board has sprung draws four more tiles.  Play then continues.  The game ends after a certain accumulated score has been reached or a certain number of rounds have been played.<br/><br/>",

In the game, you assume the role of a temporary employment agency CEO who is trying to build his or her start-up business into a thriving operation. The path to success seems simple enough: hire unemployed temp workers, help them to upgrade their skills, and find them the best short-term jobs so your company can get paid its cut. Competition with other temp agencies is fierce, though, so establishing a solid reputation as a reliable and dependable agency can bump your workers towards the front of the employment line.<br/><br/>Worker Placement plays in about 45 minutes and is suitable for 2-5 players, ages 10+. With a variety of engaging play mechanics &ndash; including card drafting, hand management, bidding, set collecting, and of course worker placement &ndash; playful illustrations with accompanying flavor text, and simple rules that take only minutes to learn, running a successful temp agency business has never been this much fun!<br/><br/>Gameplay Round Summary:<br/><br/><br/>     Action 1: Determine Player Order<br/><br/><br/>Player Order card + Thumbs Track position = position on the Player Order Track.<br/><br/><br/>     Action 2: Reveal New Jobs<br/><br/><br/>Deal one Job card for each player (minimum four cards) face up on the game board edge at the Job Centre building.<br/><br/><br/>     Action 3: Draft Business Cards<br/><br/><br/>Deal three Business cards to each player, who selects one card to add to his or her hand, passes one to the player on the left, and places the final card face down on the Peer Networking Group building.<br/><br/><br/>     Action 4: Auction Discarded Business Cards<br/><br/><br/>Place face up three randomly select Business cards from those at the Peer Networking Group building and discard the others. Starting with the first player and continuing along the Player Order Track, each player may pass or bid. Players with the top three bids select, in order, one of the Business cards up for auction and add it to their hands, reducing their positions on the Cash Track equal to their bids. Discard unselected cards.<br/><br/><br/>     Action 5: Place Workers<br/><br/><br/>Clockwise, beginning with the first player, players take turns placing all meeples on the game board buildings to gain benefits. Cash cost = number of meeples at the building. If a Job is filled, the player gains the Cash and Thumbs on the Job card.<br/><br/><br/>     Action 6: Reset<br/><br/><br/>Players reclaim placed meeples.

Everyone plays at the same time as cards are quickly passed from player to player, each trying to build sets and earn points. In the center of the action lies an open Quidditch Chest, with a Quaffle, two Bludgers, and the all-important Golden Snitch. When you lay down certain cards, these magical items come out to play! A pair of Chaser cards lets you steal another player&rsquo;s set, but if you&rsquo;ve earned the Quaffle, you&rsquo;re safe. Play a pair of Bludger cards, grab a Bludger, and throw it at a player of your choice -- if they swat the Bludger in air and it hits another player, that player must discard the cards in their hand. The action moves faster than a Nimbus 2000 as cards change hands, sets hit the table, and Bludgers hit their mark. When the Golden Snitch launches from the chest and into the air, grab it &ndash; it&rsquo;s worth extra points! The game ends when the Golden Snitch is in hand; the player with the most points wins. For fast-paced action and excitement, play Catch the Golden Snitch with your wizarding family and friends.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Magic cards help to fulfill the tasks. Who masters the turns and finds his way out of the magic garden first?<br/><br/>A new twist at the changing labyrinth. This time, the paths are bordered by hedges, which can be rotated to change the paths.<br/><br/>Each player has a stack of cards that direct him to various places in the labyrinth. In his turn, the player moves his pawn along the path; he may also rotate one hedge before, during or after his move. If he reaches his current target, he turns his next target card face up. Otherwise, he gets a magic card as consolation.<br/><br/>The magic cards can be used during a players turn to aid movement. A hole allows to slip through a hedge. Two fairies allow to fly from one fairy spot to another one, ignoring the terrain in between. A player may use any number of magic cards in his turn.<br/><br/>After a player has visited the targets on his six cards, the other players decide which exit he needs to reach to win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cave Pilot 55 is an 'Arcade' card-board game where 1-4 players race their sophisticated technological bat-planes through a gauntlet cave. Players jointly contribute to the construction of the cave.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to finish alive with the most experience points gained during the race.<br/><br/>Each turn, player's put a small part of the cave on the table, representing either the ceiling or the floor of the cave. By doing so, a long small cave is created on which different dangerous objects or animals (vampiric bat, giant centipedes, laser beams, etc) are shown. During movement the bat-planes fly either along the cave ceiling or along the cave floor until they arrive at a cave and have to encounter its horrors. The dice-fight that follows during an encounter can be won (experience points are gained) or lost, depending on the strength and equipment of the bat-plane. Players can strengthen their bat-planes by upgrading various parts of their plane (shields, short-range attack, plate armor, power, maneuverability and navigation &amp; control), however only at specific locations in the cave. Players can not only invest their money in upgrades, they can also decide to buy long-range missiles or booster fuel. The long-range missiles can be used to shoot rivals, caves and obstructions. Booster fuel is used to outmaneuver other players by playing an extra turn or to move diagonally. Some cave locations also offer the possibility to explore the local environment, and with a bit of luck player's  might find special upgrades there.<br/><br/>Each game, the layout, the length and the difficulty of the cave is different. It is a tactical game, thrilling to the last turn, based on a few simple rules, in a steampunk sci-fi technological world, where players have to continually cope with limited resources.<br/><br/>",

Key features of the game are two dice, shaded differently, with the dark die always representing tens and the light die units.  The game board stands vertically by attaching to the side of the open box, and has 36 different spaces to correspond with the possible dice results.  The doubles spaces are all &quot;Consult the Daily Bugle&quot; (market quotation cards are cycled, changing the solitary price that serves each of the non-doubles &quot;stocks&quot;).  The '66' space also provides a &quot;Christmas Bonus&quot; of $3K to the turns' player.  If there was any doubt, the &quot;Rich Uncle&quot; is Uncle Pennybags, from Monopoly fame!  The silliest part of the game is the stack of &quot;newspaper headlines&quot; that are also consulted every time a double is rolled--there's usually a humorous headline to go with the instructions on the &quot;newspaper&quot;.  E.g., &quot;Mayor of City Needs a New Car--Selects the Best Automobile that Money Can Buy&quot; is a newspaper whose instructions force each player to roll the dice to determine how much money (always in $K) they individually must pay to the &quot;pool&quot;.<br/><br/>",

There are three categories of characters (wealthy men, women, and laborers), and one guilty character is found in each of the categories.<br/><br/>The piquancy of the game is that Ep&auml;illyt has clear beginning, middle, and end phases. It is important to collect alibi and clue tiles in the beginning, and when entering the middle phase, players use the information they have gained as a medium of exchange to gain more information. In the end phase, the success lies in positioning one's detective pieces correctly and being able to manage the first phases of the game better that the other players.<br/><br/>This game was published in Finland in 2009.<br/><br/>The German edition located in old Dresden is coming in 2010!<br/><br/>",

The last player to place a block without causing the platform to tumble wins.<br/><br/>Hoverkraft is intended for two players, but it's fun to challenge yourself to build bigger and better structures. And it's a fast game, lasting anywhere from 30 seconds (what? we were distracted) to 5 minutes. Bring it to a party and you can have an entire tournament in a few hours.

Big transnational factors, such as globalization, world population growth, a shortage of raw materials, and the formation of international actors, have weakened pluralism in favor of a growing polarization on the international stage. In today's world, a few big regional powers compete for world domination.<br/><br/>In Defcon, internal frictions push decision-makers to look for international success to consolidate their power, even though it means conflict against international rivalries. In a climate of growing tension, megapowers begin an arms race to be prepared for a global scale conflict. Whoever controls the hegemonic megapower at the end of the fifth round wins, and to do this, that player must obtain the highest position on the consensus index, which is made up of two separate rankings: the reputation index and the military index. Those who will find the right balance between military strength and support from public opinion will win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player has 8 balls in their color, and 3 green ones are added as well. The first player to get 2 of them is the winner. However, both players can move any ball they want. To do this, there are two &lsquo;tools&rsquo; available: they are plastic pieces that are placed over the balls on the board. The smaller of the two grabs 3 balls (in a triangle), while the larger one has seven openings &ndash; one in the middle and six around the edges. The middle opening must be placed over a ball of your own color. Once positioned, the tools can be rotated, moving all of the balls around. If a player manages to arrange it such that a green ball is surrounded by nothing but his own color, then he can take that green ball from the board. It&rsquo;s replaced with one of your own color, which means you have a slight advantage. The first player to get 2 green balls is the winner.<br/><br/>",

A half-hearted attempt has been made to theme the game around two cannibal tribes trying to eat each other.<br/><br/>The columns on the board are numbered 3 to 9. Down the center of the board (column 6) runs a stream. The board is initially empty. Each player in turn rolls the three dice and then places one of their cannibals anywhere on the column given by the total of the three dice. If a player rolls three of a kind, they place a pawn and then take another turn. If a player rolls 1,2,3 then they do not place a pawn. If you enclose a line of the opponent's pawns between two of your pawns (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), then the opponent must take back their pawns except for those in column 6.  The enclosure may wrap around the top and bottom of the board, but not the sides.<br/><br/>The first player to place their final pawn on the board wins.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/><br/>     Dragonlance Mage Stones <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher: &quot;The game is about a group of snakes wandering in the woods trying to eat the apples that fall down from the trees (and avoiding eating the poisonous mushrooms). The snakes' frenzy bring them to run between the trees and players must me able to &quot;pilot&quot; them to the apples, avoiding mushrooms, trees and the other snakes. The game is card driven (the cards are describe the possible movements).&quot;<br/><br/>SnakeLake is a cross between the old computer game Snake and the board game Robo Rally, but is much simpler and faster than RR. You have a simple board with a grid and place some apple trees around, then each player chooses a starting point.<br/><br/>Each player uses cards to program their next three moves in secret on their own chart, with the 2nd and 3rd move sliding down each turn when the 1st card is used and a new card going in the 3rd slot. The cards simply show forward, left, right (twice each) and one stop card. They also tell you to draw an Event card, which add some randomness.<br/><br/>If your snake runs into a tree, or off the board when incomplete, or into another snake's body, you start over again somewhere else, reprogramming your next three snake moves. If you hit another snake's head, they go off and you score a point for each segment of their body. If you get your whole snake on the board and then get your head off the board, you score points for the length of your snake.<br/><br/>But the big points come from eating apples which fall from the apple trees. These have 8-12 points on them, and your snake runs over them to eat them and reveal the points scored. Likewise, there are some mushrooms which deduct points if eaten. The apples and mushrooms are placed when an Event card indicates. The other events include removing an apple, sending an opponent's snake to sleep (miss a turn), and make your snake's body longer or shorter.<br/><br/>Snake Lake is a light, fast, fun game and will suit children more than adult's. The best strategy seems to be eat an apple then get knocked off the board to start somewhere else, near more apples. Getting your whole snake on and off is hard work, and scores few points in comparison.<br/><br/>The components are nicely made, good shiny cards that should wear well. The rules need a little proof-reading but were clear enough. Snake Lake might be better for 3 or 4 players than 6 though, it got very crowded very quickly, even on the large side of the board.<br/><br/>",

As the dragon, your ultimate goal is to amass the largest treasure hoard to solidify your place as the most formidable dragon of all time.  The other dragons will envy your success and try to stop you at every turn, while they try to amass their own treasure.  Only greed, strategy, cunning, and ruthlessness will allow you to prevail and take what is rightfully yours as all others will bow before you.<br/><br/>Each dragon has its own strengths and weaknesses, along with their own preferred terrain, breathe weapon and special ability.  The dragon will fly from its lair, encountering challenges, ranging from easy to extremely difficult.  If a dragon chooses to fight an encounter tile, dice are rolled and if the dragon is successful it gets the gold that the encounter is worth.  Dragon versus dragon combat is a possibility if you wish to test your strength against the others and gain additional rewards. Once all the encounter tiles have been removed from the playing area, the game ends and the dragon with the most gold wins.<br/><br/>There is a 110 card deck in the game that allows players do a variety of things.  There are cards that can strengthen your dragon and there are cards that can hinder other dragon&rsquo;s abilities (i.e. Attack Power, Speed and Carry).  Additionally, there are cards that have the ability to manipulate game play of your choosing.<br/><br/>The playing area is modular and customizable depending on the amount of players and the size of game you wish to play. Recommendations are included in the rules, but you make each game as big or small as you like.  While gathering gold is the main objective of the game, the underlying intent is to bring friends and family together to have fun.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, 36 of the 45 Object cards are placed face-up on the table to form a 6 by 6 grid. Each card shows three different types of objects. Each player, on his turn, takes a card which he then places face up in front of himself; this continues until all of the cards have been claimed. At the end of the game, only the players who have sole majority in a family of objects (no ties are allowed) score any points.<br/><br/>Broc &amp; Troc is a captivating strategy and observation game where good choices have to be made in order to win.<br/><br/>In 2006, Broc &amp; Troc was re-released as Versailles.

        "description": "Sloop &mdash; released in Germany as Quanto &mdash; uses gameplay similar to that of Casino and Scopa with players trying to use numbered cards in hand to claim cards available on the table, but the game includes a few twists.<br/><br/>To start, the deck includes 122 cards, ten copies each of cards numbered 1-12 (with one rainbow card of each number) as well as two jokers. (Quanto has 110 cards, with one copy less of each card.) Each player starts with a hand of four cards, and four cards are laid face up on the table. On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Lay down one card, then collect all cards of the same number (including the one played) and two or more cards that sum to this number, placing all of these cards in a personal score pile.<br/>    Create a &quot;build&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Quanto&quot;) by laying down a card, taking one other card from the display, placing them to your side, then taking the matching number tile to mark this build; you can take two or more cards at the same time that sum to this value and place them in your build. In the future, you can play a card of this value to possibly add more cards to the build, then move all of these cards to your score pile.<br/>    Discard a card to the face up display. If you discard a 1, each opponent must give you a card from her score pile; if you discard a 2, you play a second card from your hand, once again taking any of the three actions; if you discard a 3, you reveal three cards from the deck, use one to perform an action, then discard the other two.<br/><br/><br/>After taking an action, you refill the face-up display to four cards and your hand to four cards. If you use a rainbow card for action 1, you can claim another face-up card of your choice; if you use one for action 3, then you add an additional card to the display.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out and all players have emptied their hands, the game ends and whoever has the most cards wins.<br/><br/>Sloop includes partnership rules that allow partners to add to (but not claim) one another's builds and to swap cards with one another during play.<br/><br/>",

E.g.: 4 cards for 4 players. &quot;You are always late&quot;, &quot;You cheat at games&quot;, &quot;You have the same Pink Floyd t-shirt since 1994&quot;.<br/>Each player give to OTHER players the card of his hand that fits him best. Therefore, in a 4 player game, you give 3 cards (and receive 3). The last one is discarded.<br/><br/>2- In turns, each player reveals the cards he has received. All players (including the &quot;concerned&quot; one) secretly vote for the best matching habit. Players who voted for the most popular score one point. The chosen card is then kept by the player for the fourth round.<br/>NOTE: The vote from the concerned player count as 1 vote only. He does not choose the habit alone, but he breaks ties.<br/><br/>On the fourth round, instead of distributing new habit cards, players skip the first phase and use the cards selected in the 3 first rounds. Each good vote is worth 2 points for this last round.<br/><br/>Player with the most point wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Steal This Game was designed by D&aacute;vid Turczi on the spot at SPIEL 2016 after an unfortunate incident left the publisher a full cash box short.<br/><br/>This nanogame, playable by two players in five minutes or less, fits on a postcard (with two dice supplied by the players). The players take turns being robbers and exhibitors at a board game trade fair &mdash; rolling dice, lying, guessing, and shuffling cards.<br/><br/>The exhibitor tries to hide cash in one of the cash boxes and keep it hidden - shell game style. The robber secretly rolls a pair of dice and then tries to make increasingly risky moves to gain more information about the location of the cash and move the clerk away from the full cash box. If the exhibitor catches the thief in a lie, the thief must immediately risk stealing from a cash box without additional information.<br/><br/>",

Each game puts you in the enviable position of being a horrid, tentacle-flailing, slime-oozing monster from outer space &ndash; cleverly disguised (of course) as an adorable and newly enrolled student at Takoashi University, an all-girls school nestled in scenic Japan.<br/><br/>Play requires matching a student, a location, and an action in order to get points for that student. Any suit combination of these cards is sufficient for a &quot;sloppy capture&quot;, but a &quot;noble capture&quot; (all items of the same suit) allows you to capture up to three students simultaneously. Noble captures also allow additional game actions.<br/><br/>Suits in the game are &quot;cute&quot;, &quot;sexy&quot;, &quot;sporty&quot;, and &quot;smart&quot;. Cultural events (such as Sports Day) and special personalities can also modify the basic game play.<br/><br/>",

Use the numbered cards to indicate the number of the current round of gameplay, but also the number of hand cards that will be used for this round and the number of points that you can win this round.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, reveal as many hand cards as the number printed on the numbered card. Then, all players start folding their fingers according to what is asked by the revealed hand cards. Usually, a hand card shows a single finger folded &mdash; but sometimes three fingers are folded, e.g., having your hand in a &quot;Bang&quot; position with the index finger and thumb unfolded. Some card also show a fully open hand. The rules are:<br/><br/><br/>     If several cards show different fingers to fold on the same hand (left or right), fold them all.<br/>     If a same finger must be folded twice, cancel this action; leave that finger unfolded.<br/>     If a fully open hand is revealed, it cancels all other hand cards that indicate you should fold a finger on this hand.<br/>     If two of the same (left or right) open hands are revealed, they cancel one another.<br/><br/><br/>When you think you have the right solution, before locking it, you have to check whether you can shoot someone. (Your character is a cowboy or a cowgirl!) If one of your hands is in the &quot;Bang&quot; position &mdash; index + thumb unfolded OR index + middle + thumb unfolded &mdash; then you can shoot someone at the table, shouting &quot;BANG!&quot;, to steal a victory point from them. If both hands are in the &quot;Bang!&quot; position, you can shout &quot;BANG! BANG!&quot; to steal two points.<br/><br/>After that step, lock your hands on the table, flipping the hands. Be careful: If a hand has no folded finger, you must place the fist on the table, not a flipped flat hand!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, in Risikard, battles are resolved by use of cards, instead of dice, and the board serves more as a visual indicator than a gaming area.<br/><br/>The game consists of 1 small map board, 2 tank pieces, a rule book and 110 cards.<br/><br/>There are 42 Territory Cards, each representing one of the areas on the map. Of the information on these cards, the most important are the number 'Value', of which a certain amount are needed to win the game, and the 'Winning Symbol' (explained below). There are 54 Army Cards and one Wild Card. All army cards have symbols representing either infantry, cavalry or artillery and a value from 1-6. There are also 13 Mission Cards, which remain hidden to others throughout the game, and state the formula one must obtain to win.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, territories are selected one at a time and starting army hands and a mission card are drawn.<br/><br/>Each turn then commences with an attack by declaring war on an adjacent territory. Cards are revealed from the attacker and defenders hand and whoever has the higher number wins, the wild card trumping any other value. When one player wins two battles, that person gains the other's territory card.<br/><br/>The second stage of the turn is the protection of territories. In this turn you may choose to defend territories by presenting three Territory Cards with different 'Winning Symbols' from the same continent (also known as a &quot;set&quot;). Protected territories may not be attacked but also can't aid to increase your number of army cards. Army cards in hand are then discarded and the same number of cards are drawn at which point the player may attack again.<br/><br/>In the final stage of a turn, the player adjusts his/her hand based on the number of sets that aren't part of protected territories that they control.<br/><br/>The game is won when a player fulfills the requirements of the 'victory formula' stated on his/her Mission Card. An example of this formula is you must control all of Africa, Oceania and you must have additional territories totalling a value of 12 or more. Players can be eliminated from the game prior to the game's end.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An update to the original Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition (1981).<br/><br/>While the core of Trivial Pursuit: Genus Edition is still found in the 25th Anniversary Edition, there are a few differences from the original board game.  The original six categories are still used: geography, entertainment, history, art &amp; literature, science &amp; nature, sport &amp; leisure.  Each category now has its own card, with six questions and three difficulty levels.  What you roll determines the level of difficulty of the question.  A roll of one or two results in an easy question, three or four a medium question, and five or six a hard question.  Play in the middle of the board is just like the 1981 version where you roll the die, move your scoring token that number of spaces, and try to answer a question in an attempt to roll again or, in a special case, win a wedge of the corresponding color.<br/><br/>The object of the game is still to win all 6 wedges and answer one final question in the center of the board.<br/><br/>The biggest difference of this new version is the addition of an outside track, which you move a 2nd playing piece, a pawn of the same color, around.  If you get a question correct, you get to move your pawn a certain number of spaces depending on the difficulty of the question answered.  If your pawn lands in one of the four &quot;specialty zones&quot;, you are granted a special power used either to help your chances to win the game or hurt your opponents.  These zones are the Face-Off Zone, the Slow it Down Zone, The Easy Cheesy Zone, and Freebie Zone.<br/><br/>",

With two levels of play to choose from&mdash;so that it's easy enough for a toddler to grasp, but also complex enough to challenge older siblings and adults&mdash;this engaging game delivers hours of entertainment for the whole family.<br/><br/>Players take turns playing coloured pieces of the board. Pieces that are placed must conform to a color pattern for that board; the player will have to convince all other players that the piece matches such a pattern.<br/><br/>When the last space on a board is filled, the player who played the last piece takes it, and the board is replaced with a new board.

        "description": "Kivi (&quot;stone&quot; in Finnish) is a tactical game of dice where the players score points by building lines of consecutive stones, either horizontally or vertically. A roll of the dice determines where you can place a stone: to stake on your own row or to block another player's game?<br/><br/>The player with the most points after 10 rounds wins the game. The rules to Kivi are easy to master but Kivi maintains its thrill throughout a game as no stone is set before the last dice have been rolled.<br/><br/>Kivi is Yahtzee with six dice, but instead of filling a scoring sheet, players place stones on a board marked with different scoring combinations. Most points are scored by creating lines of adjacent stones.<br/><br/>",

Players have to think in original twists an plot lines for their story, which they make up as they go along, for the entertainment of the other players and anyone else who is listening.<br/>The game begins when a player (the Storyteller) selects a Story Card and reads out the caption upon it, which will be the first line of a story that has yet to be created. The other players then ask the Storyteller creative and difficult to answer questions and play a letter or word Question Card. The Storyteller must develop his or her story ad hoc. This must be done using the specific word on the Question Card in the answer, or beginning the answer with the letter featured on the Question Card, depending which type was played.<br/>Players then have an opportunity to challenge an answer that they feel doesn't make sense, and all players would then vote to validate or discard an answer. If an answer gets discarded, the Storyteller's turn ends.<br/><br/>Whilst primarily designed as a party game for fun, answers can be awarded points if players wish to keep score. Once everyone has been the Storyteller, the player with the most points would win.<br/><br/>",

If one water hole is dried out, then they go to the next. On the way there, everyone is lost who misses the connection to the caravan. In the end, quite a few desert foxes lose their orientation, since their senses are confused by mirages.

Every player has the same set of cards. Movement is made by choosing one of three visible cards, which range from forward 1-4, backward 1-4 and a few special cards. While moving spaces already occupied by another camel aren't counted, so staying together with the caravan (at least for some time) is quite useful.<br/><br/>",

Only the greatest player will be declared The Ace Of Spies! By taking two cards at the start of each turn, you'll build up a selection of Agents, Tools, Intelligence and Locations that will allow you to hopefully finish more missions than everyone else. More missions mean more points - as long as they're complete! If they're left incomplete by the end of the game, they score negative points and pretty much ensure you're not going to win...<br/><br/>Four separate decks are needed to play the game. The Mission Deck cards state what combinations are needed in order to complete a mission. The more specific the requirements the more points the completed mission is worth - some can be very difficult to finish but will prove very lucrative, but there's always the risk they'll count against you.<br/><br/>The other decks represent three different cities - London, Paris and Berlin - and contain the Agents, Tools, Intelligence and Locations you'll need. Intervention cards can be used as instants and will allow you to turn the game in your favour (as long as you play them at the correct time. Should that all important card you require be lost in the discard piles, you may be able to retrieve it, but that'll come at a high cost.<br/><br/>Between two and five spymasters can attempt to become the Ace of Spies! May the most devious and sneaky win!<br/><br/>",

The best carrots of all grow between the train tracks, but you have to keep an eye out for trains! Roll the dice and hop your rabbit to the best carrot patch; as long as you don't need to flee out of the path of the train, you can happily nibble away. Chomp, chomp, chomp...<br/><br/>In Karnickel, each player places his rabbit on the circular train track made of eight interchangeable tiles, sets the train engine on its start space, then takes turns rolling the custom dice. After you roll, set any die that shows the &quot;train&quot; out of play, then count up how many times each of the player colors appears on the remaining dice; you must move one of the rabbits (yours or another player's) clockwise around the track the full number of spaces. You then pass the rabbit dice to the next player. Players take turns, each time rolling only the dice passed to them and hopping the rabbits from tile to tile, trying to land on the tiles where they will be able to collect the most carrots.<br/><br/>When a player rolls only trains, the rabbit hopping has to stop as the train is ready to move! That player rerolls all seven dice, counts up the number of trains rolled, then moves the train that many spaces around the track. Every rabbit on a tile that the train moves through is scared away by the engine and hops off the track, failing to collect any carrots this time. All rabbits still on the track after the train moves &mdash; either because the train didn't reach them or because they were on one of the two tunnel tiles &mdash; get to grab 1, 2 or 3 carrots...or maybe lose one &mdash; exploding carrots are a risk!<br/><br/>Everyone then hops back onto the track, and the next player rolls all the dice to start a new round of play. Whoever has the most carrots when one player has at least eight carrots wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Speculation is a game about having as much worth as possible when the game ends. And unlike some Monopoly-like games, this one definitely ends when one of the draw piles are empty.<br/><br/>You start the game with &euro;150,000 and that's all the money you get from the bank. No beauty contests to win here, so you'd better spend them wisely. You will get cards with collectible items, though. And the item value increases the more items you have in the collection. So getting lots of cards in one collection is good, but naturally there is a risk - each collection can possibly be fake and worth nothing. This is controlled by the Insider Information cards which sometimes are available for auction in the game.<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the game is the trading part. If you put cards down on the table, they are always for sale, and if an opponent happens to land on Trade, he can buy a category from you (for the market value). However, you can never lose money on showing your cards, but your opponent may increase his collection and therefore earn more - unless they are fake, of course.<br/><br/>The final balancing aspect is that the cards that you don't show are not declared properly, so if you land on Tax Razzia, you have to pay for those cards.<br/><br/>There are also bank-controlled auctions.<br/><br/>Speculation is a very well balanced, exciting and different economic game and you don't know for sure who's the winner until it's all over.<br/><br/>The game is in Swedish and scales well from three to five players. It works well for six players as well, but then you have to add a player marker and some money.<br/><br/>",

The maze is divided in a number of circular zones which end up at the center of the maze, the treasure chamber.<br/><br/>Each player picks 6 pawns of the same color, 1 &quot;Gods &amp; Heroes&quot; card and 5 &quot;Events&quot; cards.

The &quot;Events&quot; cards describe certain actions, but when their effect is accomplished they are discarded from the game.<br/>     The &quot;Beast&quot; card is triggered when the treasure is picked by a pawn from the Treasure chamber. This card has an effect that may change the game scenario and lasts thereafter, until the end of the game. <br/><br/><br/>Object of the game is to claim the treasure with one of your pawns and escape from the maze with it.<br/>This is not as easy as it seems though! The mazes walls are impossible to pass and as they are rotating, your pawns may get trapped and be killed! The Beast which lurks about may overturn the game!

You can use a set of checker-like pieces or poker chips, with a mark on its bottom side to recognize promoted pawns or &quot;Herooj&quot;. For the Masters, you can use 4 pawns from a chess set, or any other 4 pieces of your election.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/> PAWNS: A pawn can move 1 or 2 cells orthogonally or diagonally forward, (backwards and sideways moves are not allowed for pawns).<br/>they can capture by jumping orthogonally (in straight line) over an adjacent friendly piece and falling on an inmediately adjacent enemy piece, which is removed from the board, (backwards and sideways captures are allowed, but not diagonal captures).<br/><br/>MASTERS: A master can move 1 or 2 cells in any direction, orthogonally or diagonally forward and backwards. Also, it can capture in the same way of pawns (jumping over an adjacent friendly piece and falling on an inmediately adjacent enemy piece) but in any of 8 directions (including diagonals).<br/><br/>HEROOJ: When a pawn reaches the far rank of the board is promoted to &quot;heroo&quot;. It can move sideways and backwards (orthogonally and diagonally), but NOT FORWARD. It captures like pawns.<br/><br/>GOAL: The goal of HEROOJ is bringing back one heroo to the player's safe zone (2 first rows of the player's side).<br/>A player can also win if he eliminates all the opponent's pawns/herooj.<br/><br/>",

Additionally, there are 3 &quot;community&quot; dice rolled in advance, mirroring the &quot;flop&quot; in Texas Hold'Em poker.  Players &quot;bid&quot; the number of dice of a certain type that they think have been rolled, totalling all players' dice plus the community dice.  (There are also wilds that count as any type.)  Players must continue increasing the &quot;bid&quot; clockwise around the table until someone decides to &quot;call&quot; the bidder.  Then, all dice are revealed, and 2 additional &quot;community&quot; dice are rolled, mirroring the &quot;river&quot; and the &quot;turn&quot;.  If the bidder can make his bid, the caller must pay him the number of chips equal to the difference between his bid and the actual count, otherwise the bidder pays the caller.  If the bidder made his bid exactly, he wins the pot.  In any case, the loser of that challenge also loses one of their dice.  A player is out of the game if he runs out of chips or dice.<br/><br/>",

If a player loses all their Heart points, they are Scared to Death. If they lose all their Mind points, they have Gone Crazy. In either case, they are out of the game.<br/><br/>On a typical turn a player will face an Enemy or Ordeal, and try to beat it using a Slider with inverse stat values to make their Courage and Sanity greater than what they are facing. Beating Enemies and Ordeals earns Reward cards as well as points.<br/><br/>During turns players can place one of each type of Stuff card on the table in front of them. Stuff cards are Weapons, Buddies or Things. Stuff can help its owner, or be used to mess with opponents.<br/><br/>",

Players start in opposite corners of the board and create a dungeon as they move along by placing randomly chosen tiles.  The goal of the game is to reach the Treasure Chamber in the center of the board and escape back out again with some of the valuable artifacts contained therein.  There are two ways the game can end.  One way is that once someone escapes the dungeon with one of the Warlock's artifacts, they are declared the winner.  The other way is that the players set a time limit.  Once time is up, the game is over and players compare the value of the items they have accrued.  The one with the highest ranked artifact is declared the winner.  If no one has an artifact, then the player with the total highest value in items is the winner.<br/><br/>Players compete mainly against the board, though player-to-player conflict can happen in two rare instances.  Players earn experience points for defeating denizens of the dungeon and laying tiles in their own quadrant, and this in turn improves their combat speed.  The game components and rules are written in both English and German.<br/><br/>",

If a player lands on one of their spaces, they must turn over a tree in search of the Gruffalo to scare the hungry predator away. So while the game is dice-driven, it rewards memory too.<br/><br/>Very fast playing and with lovely illustrations from the book, it's a good introduction to dice and turn-taking for younger children.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In X Marks the Spot, players are pirates who aren't searching for treasure marked by an X, but rather trying to place that X themselves.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with three gold(ish) doubloons and a hand of four cards; most cards are divided into two sections, with the sections indicating one of four pirate icons, open water, a ghost ship or a kraken. Some cards contain actions &ndash; e.g., cannon, plunder &ndash; that can be played against an opponent.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws two cards, then plays two cards. Cards are placed to form a grid on the playing area. A pirate icon can cover a pirate icon of the same type; a ghost ship is wild and counts as all pirate icons, and can cover and be covered by any pirate icon; open water can cover or be covered by any pirate icon or a ghost ship. A kraken can be covered only by a ghost ship, although a cannon can remove it from play.<br/><br/>Your goal is to create three Xs in the playing area that feature your secret icon. As soon as you (or an opponent) create an X, whether connected orthogonally or diagonally, you mark the center space with one of your doubloons. The first player to place her three doubloons on the board wins.<br/><br/>",

They have been kicked off the ship by their captain in Walk the Plank and chased by sharks in Get Bit, and now they face their final challenge.<br/><br/>In Hold Your Breath! each player assumes the role of a pirate treading water in the ocean. These brilliant tacticians have decided to play a game of &quot;Hold Your Breath&quot; to see who is the toughest pirate because, you know, what else are you gonna do in the middle of the ocean facing certain death?<br/><br/>The game is played in two rounds. In the first round, each player may dive deeper, providing they have the &quot;Swim&quot; and &quot;Air&quot; cards to do so. Players press their luck each turn since it is the pirate who dives the deepest in round one AND resurfaces in round two who is the winner. What about the losers? Who cares, they are losers. But if you really want to know, well, they dove down and ran out of oxygen before they could resurface, so now they are just &quot;resting&quot; underwater until the next game, okay? But we digress...<br/><br/>Players can play &quot;Panic&quot;, &quot;Shark&quot;, and other nasty cards on the other players, slowing their progress. In the second round each player struggles to reach the surface before he runs out of air and therefore decides to take a rest. Most of the pirates may not make it back to the surface, but the one who makes it back alive AND dove the deepest is the winner. Be careful, though, because if you dove the deepest in the first round, you will surely have the toughest time getting back to the surface since A) you swam the deepest and B) no one else wants to see you make it back alive.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cinelinx is a fast paced card game of connecting movies, actors, genres and more together to form cohesive links between them. With a dynamic play area based on every card played, the game constantly adapts itself to film fans of any level of skill or knowledge. Want to throw a wrench into things? Director's Cut cards can often hinder your friends or change the rules to keep things interesting. Now you finally have an outlet for that wealth of movie trivia building up in your brain!  <br/>Cinelinx is a new take on movie trivia games and is the perfect way to test your movie knowledge and challenge your friends during your next movie or game night!<br/><br/><br/>Rules<br/>1) Separate Director&rsquo;s Cut cards from the main deck and set them aside nearby. Then shuffle the main deck and allow each player to draw 10 cards.<br/>2) An anchor card is needed to start the game. We recommend locating a genre card from the main deck and dropping it in the center of the table to begin. The remaining genre cards should stay in the deck to be drawn randomly during gameplay.<br/>3) Decide amongst yourselves who will go first, and then continue playing clockwise.<br/>4) Players should take turns connecting cards in their hands to cards in play. Players can only play ONE card during their turn, unless instructed otherwise by a Director&rsquo;s Cut card.<br/>Tip: Cards can be dropped vertically or horizontally and connected to any open side of a card in play. The reels that are formed as cards connect should not touch unless a valid connection is made.<br/><br/>5) Connections must be verbally announced to be considered valid. A connection can be defined as the relationship between two cards. See our official rulebook for complete connection details.<br/>Example announcement: &ldquo;Jonah Hill and Leonardo DiCaprio can be connected because they were both in &lsquo;The Wolf of Wall Street&rsquo;. &ldquo;<br/><br/>6) During their turn, if a player does not have a playable card in their hand they can DRAW a card and play it immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card in their hand they can draw a second time and play the card immediately, if possible. If they still do not have a playable card then their turn is over. <br/>Instead of drawing, if a player cannot play a card in their hand they can choose to SWAP up to three cards in their hand with three random cards from the main deck. Once a player has swapped cards their turn is immediately over. A player can only SWAP once per game. Cards that are discarded should be placed back into the main deck.<br/>7) A connection can be challenged at any time.<br/>8) The first person to shed their full hand wins.<br/><br/>Director&rsquo;s Cut<br/>During gameplay, when someone plays a Directors card from their hand they are allowed to draw from the Director&rsquo;s Cut deck and should follow the instructions on the card they draw. Most Director&rsquo;s Cut cards can be played immediately. <br/>Challenging a play<br/>If a connection is challenged and is proven VALID then the challenger must either draw a card or lose a turn. The player who was challenged can decide which option the challenger should proceed with.<br/>If a connection is challenged and is proven INVALID then the player who was challenged must take their card back and draw an additional card. Their turn ends immediately after they draw.<br/><br/>Download the Cinelinx Rulebook<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game, each player takes the part of an &quot;xtreme&quot; rock climber trying to be the first to scale Rock Jocks Mountain. Each climber has &quot;super-strechin' arms&quot; that hold on to the top of the cliff. Players alternate turns grabbing and playing &quot;rock tokens&quot; that say what to do on each turn, and place plastic animals (goats, vultures, snakes; even the ominous Yeti) onto the enemy climber's arms and legs. But be careful! Your opponent just might have a reversal token, and you'll have to put the animal on your OWN climber! The more animals you hang, the more your climber's arms stretch - and when there's too much hanging off of him, he'll tumble off the mountain!<br/><br/>Rock Jocks is another of those surprisingly fun dexterity/action games that was intended for kids, but can be really entertaining between sessions of other, deeper games.<br/><br/>",

In their turn, a player throws two dice. For each die they can move one of their mice towards the cheese. If they manage to outstrip other mice or land on the same space on the table, they catch these mice and the mice's points count for them at the end. They earn also points for every mouse that managed to get to the cheese. The game ends when one player has no more mice on the board. All caught mice and all owned mice at the goal count their points, all mice that were caught by other players count negative. The player with most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The mansplainer for the round draws a topic card and four detail cards with random words. They then have 60 seconds to explain their topic &mdash; starting with the words, &quot;Well, actually...&quot; &mdash; while slipping in as many detail words as they can. They cannot use the words on their topic card during this explanation! When they finish, players write down their guesses for the mansplainer's topic and detail words, scoring 1 point for each correct guess. The mansplainer scores for each detail included in their explanation and if at least one but not all of the audience guesses the topic.<br/><br/>After everyone has mansplained twice, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game in the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>Description from Kosmos:<br/><br/>In this two-player game featuring Gallic heroes Asterix &amp; Obelix, the occupying Romans wear the usual costume for those stationed here: bumps and bruises.<br/><br/>New Roman overseer Zenturio has let the money-hungry Gallic chief Moralelastix convince him to mount an operation against his little village. As usual, the question isn't &quot;Will the Romans get beat up?&quot;, it's &quot;How badly will the Romans get beat up?&quot;<br/><br/>The two players play as Asterix and Obelix. Each takes the matching playing figure as well as a set of 15 beating cards (3 cards in each of 5 different colors), which he places in front of himself as a face-down deck. Each player takes the top 5 cards in hand. In addition to the beating cards, there are Roman cards. Most of them show Roman Legionnaires (in 5 different colors), but there are also Pirates, Wild Boars, the traitor Moralelastix and 5 Village Feast cards.<br/><br/>The 40 cards are well shuffled and placed as a face-down pile. Then, the top 16 cards are drawn and placed face-down on the table in classic Phalanx formation (4x4 grid). The remaining cards act as a draw pile.<br/><br/>The player with the longest mustache (or alternately the biggest belly) begins. He places his figure in front of one of the four Phalanx rows and turns the topmost card over. A red Roman! Red Romans can only get beat up by Red beating cards. If the active player doesn't have any, then the Roman card is turned back over again and that player's turn is over. If he does has a red card, though, then he has to choose whether to end his turn (taking the beaten Roman as a trophy) or turn another card over, hoping to press his luck.<br/><br/>A player can keep going until (in an extreme case) he's cleared an entire row of the Phalanx. In that case, the active player gets to refill his hand to 5 cards and then start in on another row. Of course, that may not be such a good idea. Because if he keeps going and finds a Roman card he can't beat up, then his turn is over and he receives nothing. All of the Romans he would have won are removed from the game instead. Players can reduce the luck a little bit, in that they can discard one card from their hand to look at the last card in the row where they placed their figure.<br/><br/>When a player ends his turn (freely or because he was forced to), then he refills his hand to five cards and it is the other player's turn. Any holes in the Roman Phalanx are also filled back in with cards from the draw pile. Lastly, the player whose turn just ended gets to block the next player from trying one of the rows (either horizontally or vertically).<br/><br/>Of the 40 Roman cards, only 30 show actual Romans (as well as Zenturios himself). The remaining 10 cards are: 3 Pirates, 1 Wild Boar, Moralelastix, and 5 Evening Feasts. Pirates are easy to beat: Any card will do. To get Moralelastix, two cards of a single color are needed. The Wild Boar ends the player's turn immediately, but he gets to keep the Romans he beat up on so far. If a Feast is revealed, nothing happens and the player gets to keep going. Revealed Feasts are set aside, and once the fifth Feast shows up the game is over.<br/><br/>Now, the players count their victory points. The purple point goes to the player who got Moralelastix. A brown point is for the most pirates. The majorities in the five Roman colors are worth the red, blue, yellow, green and black points, respectively. The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lifeline is a territorial strategy game for two players (Black and White) that is played on the cells of an initially empty hexhex board. The recommended board sizes are between 3 and 12 cells per side.<br/><br/>The game was invented by Michael Amundsen and Luis Bola&ntilde;os Mures. Although inspired by Go, it bears a significant resemblance to Kanare Kato's Meridians.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA group is an entire set of connected stones of the same color. A single stone, not connected to others of its color, is also a group.<br/><br/>A group is dead if there is no path of connected empty cells between that group and any other group of its color. The path does not need to be a straight line.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform the following actions in order:<br/><br/><br/>     Place a stone of your color on an empty cell. If it is your first turn of the game, perform this action twice.<br/>     Remove all dead enemy groups.<br/>     Remove all dead friendly groups.<br/><br/><br/>The board positions at the start and at the end of your turn must be different. In other words, if the only stone you remove is the one you just placed, your placement is illegal.<br/><br/>The last player to make a placement wins. Note that, after your first turn, you will always have a placement available unless you have no groups on the board.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariantsThe standard game is made fair by the combination of the double first move and White's swap option, as described above. This balancing method is called strong pie. Some alternatives are:<br/><br/><br/>     Weak pie: Instead of placing twice on their first turn, players place one stone on every turn, and dead groups are not removed until there are at least four stones on the board. White's swap option still applies, but takes place after Black has placed only one stone.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Komi pie: Before the game starts, the first player chooses a whole number as the komi value, and then the second player chooses sides. The first four stones are placed in the same manner as with weak pie, but there is no swap option after Black's fist placement. Throughout the game proper, White will have the option to spend a point of komi instead of making a placement.<br/><br/><br/>Unlike strong pie, these methods require somewhat large boards to be effective: at least base 6 for weak pie, and at least base 7 for komi pie.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designers<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This CCG is based on the original series. Each player plays with the same core crew cards in the middle of the table. These cards, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and the Enterprise, are in every starter. This is a blessing in that most CCG's make the most popular characters very rare.<br/><br/>The game can be multi-player but is designed for and best with only two players.  Each player takes turns being the &quot;Current Player&quot;: the crew of the Enterprise, while the opposing player represents the obstacles to the crew as the &quot;Challenging Player&quot;.<br/><br/>The game revolves around completing episodes as the Current Player. Each episode is made up of three cards, Mission, Plot and Discovery. You have all three cards in a generic form that you can play if you did not draw one of the types.<br/><br/>You play a mission card then the opponent plays challenges against it. You then play a plot card and more challenges. Then a discovery card and yep, more challenges (well&hellip; really you just resolve any outstanding challenges). At the end each side gets points called XC for how they did or did not do during the Episode phase.  The Current player gets XC for completing the episode while the Challenger gets XC for stifling the Current Player's efforts.<br/><br/>XC is put on the core crew and crew you enter on your side and the first player to end their turn with 25+ XC total on the crew wins. This means that XC on the core crew will count for each side when it is their turn.<br/><br/>The shots from the series used on the cards will make Star Trek fans very happy. My favorite card - Shirtless Kirk.<br/><br/>There is also an expansion for this game.

Fighters from all parts of the Empire were included in the shows, including female gladiators, wealthy Roman citizens and in some cases, even aristocrats. Now the time has come for you to gain the immortal glory of the Arena. Fight for your honor, for fame, and for your life!<br/><br/>Gladiatori is a card-driven game in which each player assumes the role of a gladiator in the Ancient Roman Empire. Action selection drives figure movement on the board. Combat cards give energy to the character actions and are used as hit points. Characters are customizable, and each player has to choose his deck composition, character skills, and participate in the auctions for Arena items. At the end, the winner will be determined by victory points &ndash; or simply by being the only one left alive!<br/><br/>This is not the usual fast, face-to-face combat game in which you attack opponents with a roll of dice. It contains many strategic and tactical aspects, and no luck factors (other than in the solo game). Customization of characters makes the combat always different: Your gladiator may be strong against some opponents and weak against others. Let's start finding your way to win!<br/><br/>Gladiatori Deluxe is a limited edition version of the game that includes eight metal miniatures &mdash; four gladiators and four animals (dog, wolf, bear, lion) &mdash; and a revised 2.0 English-language rulebook with the other languages being available online.<br/><br/>",

The Odynauts decided to take the gamble and spread out to the foremost gambling cities on our planet, from Macau to Monte Carlo and from Las Vegas to Amsterdam. They turned the casinos upside down and won at every game the casinos have on offer. Slot machines were cleaned out and poker tournaments were won. The casino bosses were not amused and quickly banned the Odynauts from their casinos. To still their voracious appetite for winning, the Odynauts have made their own casino game. Casino chips are bitten into pieces and slot machines are stolen. All these well-known items from the casino form the basis of new and unique game: Chipleader. The Odynauts challenge you. Are you brave enough to accept their challenge? Are you a smart gambler and do you have the strategic insight to score the most points in putting casino chips back together? Can you protect your chips from your opponents' attacks?<br/><br/>Chipleader is card game for two to four players. The goal is to collect as many points as you can with strategic gambling and by making casino chips before four different casinos have been visited. Players have to protect their casino chips against their opponents' attacks in an effort to become Chipleader.<br/><br/>Casino chips are made with chip fragment cards of different colors and values. Every chip fragment card has a quarter of a chip depicted on it. Four chip fragment cards can form a casino chip and only when a player has formed such a chip can she place those cards on the table. The value of a complete casino chip placed on the table can increase or decrease with the use of Odynaut face cards. By playing these cards, a player's opponents can even entirely eliminate the value of one of her chips.<br/><br/>To obtain chip fragment and Odynaut face cards, a player has to make sets with five types of &quot;gamble-suit&quot; cards. Five suit cards are randomly placed face up alongside each other on the table. This row of cards is called the &quot;gambling row&quot;. Each player also receives three suit cards at the beginning of the game. A set is created whenever three, four or five suit cards of the same type are aligned in the gambling row.<br/><br/>",

Supervised by feared judges and in the face of ruthless deities, each and every person who feels harmed or wronged may prove their rights on the bloodied sands of the Arena of the Righteous. Such persons may challenge the alleged wrongdoer to single combat and seek retribution for any crime &mdash; or at least that's what the Ancient Law states.<br/><br/>Ragers: Champions of the Arena is a game of wits and bluff for two players. Each player becomes a head of a team of Ragers &mdash; powerful fighters who settle disputes between tribes during the Great Thing that lasts for three days. During the game, players play cards depicting brave warriors and representing different types of attacks and special actions. By doing so, they gain glory points (GPs) over three rounds of fighting, and whoever gains the most GPs becomes victorious.<br/> Each day of the Great Thing is devoted to a different deity, and each day bloodthirsty spectators expect daring feats of strength and cunning, so the conditions of combat change constantly. It is up to players to choose the best strategy that will appease the crowd and enable them to outsmart their rival.<br/><br/>",

Tokens come in five player colors (19 each) and the white Jokers (5). To set up the game, slide the tokens into the racks, then place the racks in the holder so that no more than color has more than five tokens orthogonally connected. Each player then receives a token that reveals her color for the game, a token that she keeps hidden from other players.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player chooses a group of two or more orthogonally connected tokens and pushes on these tokens so that they fall through the racks and down the holder. (A player can choose to make a joker any color, so she can include or exclude a joker as she wishes during her turn.) Any tokens that were above these will slide down inside the racks. The player keeps all the tokens removed.<br/><br/>Players take turns removing tokens until either a player is eliminated from the game or no groups of two or more tokens remain. At this point, the game ends and players reveal their secret colors. Whoever has the fewest tokens of her color on the board wins! If two or more players are tied, they compare the tokens they collected during the game; whoever collected fewer of his or her own color wins.<br/><br/>",

Like any farm, this farm had rodents living on it. To be honest, it was infested with rats. Lots and lots of rats. For generations these rats had been eating the Carob Beans.<br/><br/>The farmer had a beautiful wife that loved to bake. More than anything she liked to bake pies ...All kinds of tasty pies. As the hot pies came out of the oven she would put them on the window sill of their quaint little farm house to let them cool off and the sweet aroma of the freshly baked pies would waft across the whole farm.<br/><br/>One day one of the rats noticed the pleasing fragrance and followed it all the way back the farm house. There he found a pie sitting at the window&rsquo;s edge. He tried and tried as hard as he could but being just a single rat he could not move that pie off the window sill.<br/><br/>Not wanting to easily give up he quickly ran off to get some of his fellow rats with the promise of a piece of the pie if they would help him lift it off the window sill and carry it away. They were successful! ...Very, very successful! Over time they learned that different pies weighed different amounts and that they needed more rats to take the heavier pies. The rats also started forming groups or &ldquo;crews&rdquo; to try and steal the pies. They were becoming competitive, even among themselves, in their attempts to steal these delicious treats.<br/><br/>In the human world news quickly spread of this odd phenomenon and they became know as...<br/><br/>The Pie Rats of the Carob Bean Farm!<br/><br/>In Pie Rats of the Carob Bean Farm each player takes on the role of a Captain of the Rats and tries to build a crew of not-so-loyal rats in an attempt to loot the farmer&rsquo;s wife of as many of her pies as you can. The heavier the pie the more rats it takes to steal it, the more points it is worth. The Captain with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Since Pinocchio has come to the Carpenter's house, the Carpenter is no longer lonely. However, because naughty Pinocchio lies too often, he gradually fails to distinguish between true and false. Therefore, one day, the Angel told Pinocchio: &quot;If you can finish an adventure on your own without telling any lies and detect the lies of the others in the journey, you will become a 'real' boy.&quot; Can Pinocchio eventually become a real boy and live happily ever after with the Carpenter?<br/><br/>Pinocchio: True or False is an enlightening and bonding storytelling game. A player draws a subject card, chooses one of the four subjects on the card, decides whether the story she is going to tell will be true or just a lie, then begins her story. The other players listen to the story to judge its veracity. After the story has been told, the one who grabs the Pinocchio doll first can ask the storyteller a question, which the storyteller must answer honestly &mdash; unless her story is a lie, of course, in which case she can say what she wants.<br/><br/>Each player then secretly votes on whether or not the story was a lie. Those who guess incorrectly must take a wooden nose block and make Pinocchio's nose grow by stacking their block onto his ever-lengthening nose. When a player places the nose block, the tree rings on the block must be fully covered and not visible. If any blocks fall, whoever caused this gets an &quot;Angel Token&quot;. When a player gets his third angel token, the game ends after this round, and the player with the fewest angel tokens win.<br/><br/>In order to make gameplay more challenging, if half or more players guess correctly as to whether the story is or isn't true, the storyteller must also add a block to the nose. Therefore, the storyteller should do her best to make the story confusing.<br/><br/>",

An attempt was made to fulfill the following conditions:<br/><br/>1. A minimum number of playing pieces, preferably one each. <br/>The smallest possible board.<br/><br/>2. A game with very few rules, one that would be very simple to learn and play.<br/><br/>3. A game that could be played with a high degree of skill.<br/><br/>4. A game that would not be determinate. A determinate game such as nim or noughts and crosses, is one in which the starting player could always win if he knew the strategy. An indeterminate game is one which two perfect players would play for ever.<br/><br/>The object is to score 12 points provided that the other player scores at least 6 points - if the other player scores less than six points then the player reaching 12 points is the loser! Whereas in most games the person scoring the highest number of points is the winner - in the 3 Spot game the 'winner' can be the 'loser'.<br/><br/>Points are scored by the position of the tiles on the board which is a 3x3 grid. You can try to score the points you need, or force your opponent to take points.<br/><br/>Appears with L-Game in Rex Games' Two Smart Games mini-anthology.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In No Bluff!, first published as Johnny Controletti, players begin with nine money cards totaling $13,000 in various denominations, including two cards worth zero. In turn, players roll a colored die, then offer at least one face-down money card to the player indicated by the roll. That player may either accept the offer or challenge it. After challenging the offer, the player rolls a numbered die. If the number is greater than the amount of money offered, the offering player must add at least one face-down card to the mix and begin the process anew. If the die roll is equal to the money, the offer must be accepted. If the roll is less than the offer, the offering player keeps his money and the challenging player must pay the offering player the amount offered. The first player who reaches $25,000 wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After their latest journey through time, the Odynauts have landed in the Stone Age. In this world, they are confronted with cavemen who revere fire above all else. Because not all cavemen have yet discovered how to make fire, some try to steal it from the others. The Odynauts see a challenging game in all of this, but being their usual selves think it would be more fun to put out an opponent's fire rather than to steal it. Can you navigate safely through enemy caves? Can your cavemen outwit their stronger opponents or overpower their weaker ones? Can you be the first to put out an opponent's fire?<br/><br/>Cavemen Playing With Fire is a strategic two-player card game. The goal is to be the first player to put out one of her opponent's three fires, which in game terms means taking one of the opponent's three fire cards.<br/><br/>To play the game, each player receives an identical deck of 25 cave, fire, and caveman cards. Players use the cave cards to create a playing field on the table with three fire cards for each player at each end. In turns, players place cards and take action. They walk and fight among their own caves and those of the enemy to try to reach one of the enemy's fire cards. The cavemen cards are ranked, and some have special abilities. Lost cards can return to the drawing deck, but to do so a player must lose certain cards first. Losing these is tricky, though.<br/><br/>",

This strategic game of 3 in a row may sound simple, but do you have what it takes to cleverly select the best numbers to circle, while blocking out your opponent? Quick, fun and easy to learn, this exciting dice game will have everyone clamoring for more!&quot;<br/><br/>The basics:<br/>The game is packaged in a metal tin with dice, a score pad, 3 colored pencils and rules.  Each player takes a different colored pencil and on their turn rolls the 3 dice.  They can choose 2 of the dice to form a 2-digit number and circle that number on the score pad.  Three in a row will score.  The game provides a great balance of offense and defense as players strategically decide which number is best to choose for the best score or the best block.<br/><br/>",

The die defines which tile to pick from the tile holder and the player needs to place this piece on his/her board. But the piece can't touch other pieces of the same color.<br/><br/>The fun part is that the die can't lay still for more than five seconds. So after one minute you have lots of pieces on and besides your board and are pretty stressed to make it all fit on the board. The first player who can make it all fit on his board wins.<br/><br/>",

Hippies?!?!<br/><br/>What is Your Worst Nightmare?<br/><br/>This is the first-ever card game that&rsquo;s creepy and fun and designed to help people face their fears. To make this game, we carefully researched the things that scare people the most. Things like Flying, Death, Public Speaking, and Family Reunions. It includes 300 beautifully photographed Fear Cards that depict the scariest, and the funniest, fears you&rsquo;ve ever seen or experienced. Up to four people can play at once&mdash;the winner is the first player to score (you guessed it) 13 points by correctly ranking the fears of the other players. You&rsquo;ll discover entirely new aspects of your friends, family&mdash;even your significant other&ndash;that you didn&rsquo;t even know existed. But best of all, Your Worse Nightmare spurs great conversations that help people start the process of facing their fears&mdash;because acknowledging and talking about fears is the first step to overcoming them. It&rsquo;s the card game that turns fear into fun!<br/><br/>Start the game by shuffling the stack of Fear Cards and flipping over the top four. Place them face-up for everyone to see. Players then secretly rank the cards on their Scarecards in the order of what scares you the most, from 1 (the scariest) to 4 (the least scary). After jotting down your own fears, select another player to rank. Afterwards, players take turns reading their rankings. Each fear you correctly ranked earns you one point. And guessing all four fears correctly earns a bonus point. After everyone has had a turn, play starts over with four more Fear Cards. Players choose who they want to rank, but they have to rank each other player at least once. Play continues until someone reaches 13 points and wins the game! Don&rsquo;t be scared, it&rsquo;s frighteningly fun!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Massive board shows Ulysses' voyage from Troy to Ithaca.<br/><br/>Players take on the roles of Minerva (helping him) or Neptune (hampering him). The latter secretes 8 perils about the Mediterranean. Then Minerva's wind blows the fleet of six ships from the shores of Troy. The fleet is driven hither and yon by the players' competing winds. There can even be Billiard-style caroms on the board edges. Perils are resolved by each player rolling a die. A victory by Neptune sinks a ship. Six sinkings reduces Ulysses to his raft, with which he can still hope to make the Ithacan strand.<br/><br/>Rated by the publisher as difficulty 1, i.e. least difficult.<br/><br/>Rules in Italian, English, French and German.  The Italian version may be less ambiguous than the others.<br/><br/>Capsule-reviewed by Sid Sackson in Strategy &amp; Tactics no. 83 (The Kaiser's Battle).<br/><br/>",

The card box is then rotated a couple of times until none of the players are sure which cards lay where.<br/><br/>Then each player tries, with help of the &quot;spade&quot;, to &quot;dig out&quot; as many cards with plus points as possible. Those plus points are worth money.<br/><br/>As soon as you stumble upon a minus card, you have to give the spade to the next player, lose all the money you collected so far this turn AND pay the minus penalty. You may also stop anytime before.<br/><br/>The player who has collected the most money when the game ends, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a family tree indicating which are their favorite descendants and win points if they arrive in the right order. In turn order, players must play one of their cards in hand in one of these two ways:<br/><br/><br/>    Adding the card to the movement line face down. When there are five movement cards, they are revealed and the movements resolve.<br/>    Discarding the card to use its special ability.

        "description": "Moscow is one of the four original Crime Scene Games. It is a mystery solving game that combines three main elements:<br/>1) A modern mystery story written by professional crime author Arttu Tuominen. 2) Finding details from a &quot;Hidden image&quot; picture. 3) More or less classic puzzle solving. The puzzles range from single to four card ones, and from light to quite heavy.<br/>Players can use hints to help with the solving, but it costs them Reputation cards. Giving a wrong answer also makes the players lose a Reputation card.<br/>The more Reputation Cards the players have left at the end, the easier it is for them to follow the &quot;Hunch&quot; found on the remaining cards, and ultimately choosing the correct option in the &quot;Final Choice&quot;<br/>The high age recommendation comes from a few graphic details in the story. These can be skipped by parents playing with their children (12+), as long as they are aware such exist in the game.<br/><br/>Challenge Level 4/5<br/><br/>",
