        "description": "Stellar Prospector is a light game for 3-5 players vying for the chance to run a start-up franchise that prospects rare elements from stars in their planetary system.  The first candidate franchisee to complete five specific delivery missions of specific rare elements to particular planets wins the right to run the franchise (and thus wins the game).<br/><br/>Players start the game with a small amount of money but no ships,  pilots or fuel.  In order to prospect and deliver rare elements, players must hire pilots and buy ships and fuel.  Ships may be bought and pilots hired either at auction or from the shop.  Higher level pilots and ships have a better chance of success but cost more money.  Players make more money either by prospecting and delivering rare elements or bumming around the home base planet doing odd jobs.<br/><br/>Players must learn which stars contain what rare elements through trial-and-error missions and taking note of other players' routes and deliveries.<br/><br/>So players must balance observation with action, knowledge with uncertainty in their race to complete their missions, because star mining is a risky business, with pilot error or ship failure resulting in a fiery end to both.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a card game published by a church in Singapore, to teach players the 10 commandments and how they should be applied.<br/><br/>The 'dominoes' are cards divided into two squares, with a commandment (either the number or the text of the commandment), a name (of a person or place), an action or a picture (e.g. a golden calf). There are also two six-sided dice: one has the numbers, 1 to 6, the other has special symbols.<br/><br/>The 61 dominoes are dealt out evenly to all players (up to four) and the remaining card is placed face up in the middle. Players then try to lay dominoes down by matching them with the ends of the domino line on the table (like conventional domino games). Squares match if their content are related (e.g. the number of the commandment will match the actual words of the commandment). Any player can challenge a match, whereupon the person laying the domino &quot;must explain himself with proofs from the bible or they can seek an outside moderator&quot;.<br/><br/>After making a match, the player rolls both dice to determine who will play next (based on the number rolled and the symbol that comes up).<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to finish all his or her cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A game that simulates harness racing and teaches the player to handicap, or predict real harness racing results.  The game starts with Race #4.  The previous Races (1,2,3) have already taken place and data from these races have been recorded on the Past Performance Chart.  In actual harness racing there are various sources where you can gather the information that is needed to create a Past Performance Chart for actual horses &amp; drivers.  So based on the Past Performance chart you decided how much risk that you can take and place wagers on the race.  The movement of the horses is based on the Past Performance chart data with probabilities of different outcomes based on a history of actual races.  These probabilities are realized in the game thru movement cards and a spinner.  The movement mechanism does not take into account all of the information that is recommended to be collected for making bets at the track.  However, to take everything into account would make for an overly analytical game and would present the false concept that predicting races is just a matter of math.  The game instructions explain all of the common terms and concepts that are considered important when deciding what bets to place.  And it presents a logical method for recording important information needed to place bets.  If you ignore the educational aspects of the game it is a fun game.  The pawns movement mechanism is similar to the more well known Win Place &amp; Show.  In each round the rigs have a movement for the round and then two of the pawns receive bonus movement.  The races in this game are much shorter than most other race games, about 4 rounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "I don't know why you wanted to come here out of all the places you could have taken your vacation but take heed stranger. If you thought the gangs that prowl your cities were dangerous then you obviously haven't done your homework on Transylvania. You can't go out at night for fear of running into the blood sucking Blood Leeches or the flesh eating Howlers. You even have to be careful during the day for fear of running into a member of the Stitched looking for some new body parts to create their next member. Nowhere is safe and tonight there is a full moon. The Howlers will be uncontrollable once the moon rises. If I were you I'd hop on the next train and get the hell out of here while the sun still shines.<br/><br/>Welcome to Gangs of Transylvania a miniatures rule set for gang warfare between supernatural creatures. With this game you will be able to create your own gang of vampires, werewolves, and a host of other horror creatures to fight for the right to rule the streets of Transylvania. These rules are available as a downloadable PDF. To play each player creates a gang (generally 5-10 models) depending on a predetermined number of points.  A general game is normally around 200 pts. You'll also need at least 3 10-sided dice, a tape measure and a 3'x3' play area.  Feel free to include as much 3D terrain (buildings, trees, etc) as you like.<br/><br/>1. MINIATURES<br/><br/>It is a good idea to have the miniatures of all the gang members you will be using before you create your gang. It is also a good idea for all players to have miniatures that are similar in scale.<br/><br/>2. CREATION POINTS<br/><br/>Before you can create your gang all players must decide on how many creation points will be used for gang construction. An average gang costs 200 creation points.<br/><br/>3. GANG MEMBERS<br/><br/>There are five different types of gang members for you to choose from each with its own special rule.<br/><br/>4. CREATURE TYPE<br/><br/>Creature type refers to what type of creature the gang member is. There are ten different types of creatures to choose from. Each creature has its own unique special rule.<br/><br/>5. WEAPONS<br/><br/>Once you have all of your gang members chosen you need to arm them with weapons to fight with.<br/><br/>6. FREAK POWERS<br/><br/>Freak powers only apply if one of your gang members is a freak. Freaks can be given bizarre<br/><br/>",

This piece will never be moved again.<br/><br/>The objective is to form a line of three pieces, a Battleship between a Submarine on one side and a Mine on the other side. This line can be horizental, vertical or diagonal, and it doesn't matter which of the three pieces are that players. He can win if, for example, he puts his Battleship between two enemy pieces. If victory is acheived the winning player must call out &quot;You're Sunk&quot; to end the game.<br/><br/>I think a lot of games might well be draws (as in Noughts and Crosses, for instance).

        "description": "Bullying is a complex process involving the bully, the intended victim, the bystanders, and the climate in which the bullying takes place. Bullies to Buddies is an educational game that deals with the complex nature of bullying in a way that elementary school students can understand and learn specific skills. Players learn that all students must take a stand against bullying. For example, the target (intended victim) can use assertiveness skills to discourage bullying. If bystanders are present during the bullying or know about it beforehand, they can take action to discourage it. Regardless of when they learn about it (before, during, or afterwards), all bystanders can refuse to give the bully the status, popularity, and power that he/she is looking for. Bullying then ceases to be a useful tool for the bully to achieve his/her goals. Players learn in the game that they can do a great deal to discourage bullying, even with things as simple as telling a bully to stop or refusing to laugh at a bully&rsquo;s mean jokes. Students will learn skills to use when they are:<br/><br/>a target of bullying who wants non-violent skills for stopping bullying.<br/>    a bystander who wants to discourage bullying.<br/>    a former bully who wants to gain popularity without resorting to bullying.<br/><br/>Players also learn the difference between &ldquo;tattling&rdquo; and &ldquo;telling&rdquo;. Guidelines are given when it is appropriate to go to a trusted adult for help. Players earn points by giving advice to targets (intended victims), bystanders who are present during the bullying, bystanders who are not present but learn of the bullying later on or beforehand, and the bullies, themselves. Bullies to Buddies&reg; intentionally avoids putting players in the role either the intended victim or the bully, avoiding embarrassment and defensiveness. A 24&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; poster is included, so that teachers can continue to reinforce the skills learned by the players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Call Me Capable is an educational board game that helps students understand disabilities, as well as to help them learn to respect and empathize with persons with disabilities. It stimulates players to focus on the capabilities of people living with disabilities. The game is designed primarily for educating students who are not disabled, although disabled students enjoy playing immensely. The game has two sets of cards, one for elementary students, and one for middle and high school students.<br/><br/>Players move around the board picking cards and discussing the questions posed on the cards. Emotion cards ask players how they would feel if they interacted with people with disabilities or had to live with a specific disability. Experience cards ask players to discuss the practical aspects of living with various disabilities. Imagination cards ask players to imagine situations in which the player has a disability or wants to help a person with a disability. Challenge cards are multiple choice questions that add to the players&rsquo; knowledge about specific disabilities, ways for disabled people to improve their lives, and famous people with disabilities.<br/><br/>Call Me Capable was originally developed by Carol Leish, who sustained disabilities from an auto accident when she was a young child. The game gives a unique insight into both the limitations and possibilities of living with disabilities. Most of all, the game reflects Carol&rsquo;s philosophy of focusing on the capabilities of herself and other disabled people.<br/><br/>",

Issues such as respecting differences and respecting the environment are included. The game is careful not to equate respect with obedience. The players learn that it is acceptable to disagree (including with parents and with adults at school) as long as it is done in a respectful way. Cards demonstrate respectful ways of disagreeing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bully Safe is an educational card game that teaches a systems approach to reducing bullying behavior.  All children have been involved in bullying incidents, whether as a target, a bully, or a bystander.  Players learn that everyone can play an important role in reducing bullying.  The target of the bullying will become the victim if he/she cannot stop the bullying attempt.  In addition, the bystander who laughs when the bully makes fun of another student is unwittingly rewarding the bully with the status he/she seeks and encouraging more bullying.<br/><br/>Like other behavior, bullying behavior is not random, rather it is motivated by specific goals.  Most bullying is motivated by social goals, such as status, popularity, power, having fun, etc.  The game emphasizes that all students in the school community have the ability to support bullying or to discourage it.  Students learn concrete, non-violent skills to use in bullying situations.  In addition to the game's systems approach, it differs from most other approaches to bullying in two important respects.  First, it pays attention to the potentially positive role of the bystanders.  Second, it gives bullies positive skills to use to achieve their goals without resorting to bullying behavior.<br/><br/>The game box includes rules for both cooperative play and competitive play.  In each version players read Situation cards that describe typical middle school bullying behavior.  Players then offer advice to the target, the bystanders, or the bully (on how the bully can achieve goals using pro-social skills instead of bullying).  Players earn tokens for their sound advice.  In order to facilitate learning and help the players give sound advice, the game includes a list of non-violent skills that targets and bystanders can use to reduce and stop bullying.  Players also learn when it is appropriate to seek help from a trusted adult.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From a description of the game at ALL ABOUT GAMES<br/><br/>Following most of the words of the Cock Robin nursery rhyme the card game has the players answer the questions found within the rhyme. The first one being, &ldquo;Who killed Cock Robin?&rdquo; And the last one being, &ldquo;Who will sing the psalm?&rdquo;<br/>The old card game offers a twist at the ending and differs from the nursery rhyme. The players of the game are told Cock Robin is alive and well and they have all been telling a story! This is the part of the game which truly has the players interacting with each other and reveals the fun age of the times.<br/>The directions for the game of Cock Robin begin with choosing a person to be the dealer. After having all the cards dealt out to theplayers, the dealer is then the person who asks the questions.  For example, the dealer reads the first question of &ldquo;Who killed Cock Robin?&rdquo; The correct animal card to specifically answer is the Sparrow card. It reads, &ldquo;I, said the Sparrow, with my bow and arrow. I killed Cock Robin.&rdquo; If the player has the &lsquo;Sparrow&rsquo; card, he lays his card down on the table in front of him and the dealer asks the next question to the next player (Who saw him die?).<br/>If the player does not have the sparrow card in his hand, he picks a card from the player to his left and reads a generic answer card (often humorous) before laying that card on the table in a separate pile. The dealer proceeds to ask the next player the same question until the correct answer card is found and played. The player who answers the question will take any of the generic cards played to the question and place them (if there are any) in his hand<br/><br/>Once all the questions have been read and answered the exciting part of the game begins! The dealer reads the following script,<br/>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Bullfinch, Oh, Mr. Popinjay <br/>Never believe what these little birds say-<br/>Bad little birds&mdash;telling us a story-<br/>Cock Robin is alive in all his glory!&rdquo;<br/>The dealer continues to read the next line of,<br/>&ldquo;Cock Robin is all alive&mdash;Mr. Sparrow, pay a fine for that story now, about your bow and arrow.&rdquo;<br/><br/><br/>The player who has the Cock Robin Sparrow Card in front of him must then &lsquo;pay the fine&rsquo;. The fine is anything the dealer wants it to be. In the directions, suggestions for the fine are, &ldquo;to kiss the one loved best (which is often the looking glass), or to flatter some of the other company&hellip;&rdquo;<br/>Additional scripts are read for each of the animals and the players with these cards in front of them must do what it says. Other examples are as follows:<br/>  Cock Robin is all alive&mdash;Miss Lark, Shut your eyes and sing us a song in the dark. <br/>  To pay for the story you told&mdash;Mr. Linnet, tell us where your night cap is, and how you get in it. <br/>  Your manners are very bad, Mr. Rook, in all your reading what was your dullest book?<br/> The last script read reveals the winner of the game of Cock Robin. It reads, &ldquo;And now Mr. Thrush, Come out of your bush, and sing us a song. Or give us a riddle; and we&rsquo;ll grant you the fame of winning the game.&rdquo;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Accolade each player takes on the role of the Lord of a medieval household.  The players must guide four Squires on their journey around the board on their quest to become Knights and garner influence for their household.  During their journey, they will also be attempting to keep the rival households in check.  Can you be the most influential Lord and gain the ear of the King?  Only time will tell.<br/><br/>Inspired by classic games such as Parcheesi/Ludo and Checkers/Draughts, Accolade is an abstract game of chance and strategy, which has players maneuver their Squires around the exterior path of the board in an attempt to reach their home cathedral (similar to Parcheesi).  Once the Squire makes it to the cathedral, he receives his Accolade and is knighted.  This new Knight now reenters the board, now with the sole goal of interfering with your opponent's Squires and Knights.<br/><br/>The board is made up of a central hub and 4 spokes, which are assembled differently depending on the number of players (2-4), allowing for a scalable game that decreases the amount of dead time experienced in a 2 player game of Parcheesi/Ludo.  Though the board could also be used as an alternate Parcheesi board using those standard rules (and there is a bonus draughts board on the back of the main hub as well).<br/><br/>The main mechanic of the game is simple dice rolling for movement in a similar style to Parcheesi, but the pieces have more options on what they can do with those rolls.  Opposing pawns (Squires/Knights) interact with each other by Checking (landing on them, as in Parcheesi) or Capturing (jumping over, as in Checkers) them.  Pawns can attain a degree of safety by being in Castle spaces, or forming a Castle by doubling up 2 pawns of the same color.<br/><br/>Points (influence) are scored for removing opposing Squire / Knights and for any of your own Knights on the board (not in your home area).<br/><br/>The game ends once all remaining pawns are Knights, then the player with the most points (influence) gains the ear of the King and is considered the winner.<br/><br/>The game was created as an entry for TGC Classic Game Mashup Contest.<br/><br/>",

The game play time is from 30 minutes to 1 hour depending on the number of planets in play.

The course, Highland Peaks is a ficticional par 72 course.<br/><br/>Players choose the type of shot they will take. Choices range from safe, normal, or all-out from the tee, and safe, middle (of the green) or Go (for the pin) on approach shots. There are also other choices during play. On putts from the fringe and distances over 25', the player may choose 'GO' or 'LAG'. Almost anything that can happen in real golf, can happen in GolFUNator. 6 times per round, if the player hits an errant shot (trouble) he may choose to use one of his/her 6 'LUCK' cards. The results will be either good, bad, or no luck at all. <br/>A player can get HOT by getting 2 birdies in a row. He/she may also become COLD with 2 bogeys in a row.<br/><br/>The game comes with a 14x14&quot; HD laminated cardstock 2-sided board, 2 10-sided dice, 5 decks of cards, markers, scoresheets and instructions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "'Flicking through the Ages' is a 2-player dexterity civilization game created as part of the NaGaDeMon contest during the month of November 2011.  Aside from the obvious Through the Ages nod, FttA claims Flicochet, Tumblin Dice, Breakout and the classic carnival game of knocking over milk bottles as its primary pedigree.<br/><br/>FttA aims to deliver the civilization 'feel' to a dexterity game playable in under 30 minutes and assembled from easy to find materials.  It combines five completely different minigames into a timeless struggle for cultural supremacy!  Players balance their actions by using population discs in the following ways:<br/><br/>1. Gather resources by flicking your disc down a platform decreasing in size with increased return for increased risk.<br/>2. Research new technologies by flicking your disc at one of four stacks of available technologies arranged like a breakout game and taking the block you strike.  Once obtained, players need to choose whether or not to add the technology to their list of abilities or to trade in the block to increase their population<br/>3. Declare war on the other player's civilization by flicking your disc at their researched technologies stacked in a pyramid.  Knock your opponent's blocks down to steal population, technology or colonies<br/>4. Vie for colonies by flicking your disc closer to the colony disc than your opponents<br/>5. Construct Wonders of the World by stacking resource cubes on a disc and sliding it along a path symbolizing the shape of the building without letting one fall<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/><br/>Construction of 'Flicking Through the Ages' requires:<br/>1 set of Jenga-style blocks<br/>1 set (2 colors) of 'bakelite'-style backgammon discs or other discs of roughly 1.25&quot; diameter that flick reasonably well and are heavy enough to impact a tower of Jenga blocks enough to fall over<br/>1 set of the rules including the 'colony' and 'technology' sticker sets to be applied (or taped) to the above components<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Viva la ResistANTS! is an abstract boardgame. Main game mechanics includes area controll, set collection and 'press your luck'. It combines American and European styles of boardgaming design. The game has a unique setting. The forces of Resistance of Ants led by the mysterious Serg Ant try to help the civilians survive under the occupation of enemy forces, who perfidiously attacked the peaceful republic of ants. Now you must fight for your freedom. Let's say together: Viva la ResistANTS!<br/><br/>Each player has a detachment of 10 ants. Each turn the player can send 2 of them to the field to participate in a special mission or withdraw 1-3 of them. At the start of the game the playfield is generated randomly. If 1 or more ants get status missing in action, players should shuffle the tiles of the playfield and generate it randomly again. Other ants return to players. The ants get status missing in action if a card from alert deck with the appropriate colour is revealed for the second time. One card from alert deck is revealed every time each player takes a turn. If the same colour is revealed for the third time the alert deck must be shuffled. If it must be shuffled for the second time, the game is over. The player who gets more victory points becomes a winner. In case of a tie, the winner is the player who retained more ants.<br/><br/>",

As players draw cards, they discuss what they&rsquo;d do in bullying situations, are asked to talk about conflict resolution skills, compliment other players, and practice empathy. Each time a player gives a response, he or she gets to take away one piece of the Bully Machine from the game board. Watch out, though: someone might draw a Mean Moment card, which will suggest that a player has done something mean to help build up the Bully Machine. Then the player has to replace one Machine Card. When the machine is totally dismantled, everyone wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "CLIQUE : The Card Game<br/><br/>Welcome to CLIQUE, the game of ruthless popularity. You play as that most terrifying of creatures, the pretty, popular, teenage girl. The goal is simple, to accumulate enough popularity to take over the Clique and rule the school. You accomplish this by gaining the things all girls need for societal domination, The Car, The Look, The Gear and the ultimate accessory: The Guy. But your opponents, the other girls in the Clique are out to stop you with that most powerful and destructive of weapons: Gossip. Is that Look So Last Season? Is your new Car actually Used? Is your new Guy Secretly Gay? Get all four Acquisitions, free yourself from the vicious Gossip, and you can take over the Clique.<br/><br/>Mechanics<br/><br/>The deck breaks down like this:<br/><br/>6 Avatars - These are the girls, each with a unique look and style.<br/>6 Looks - From Goth to Ghetto Fabulous.<br/>6 Cars - Will you go for Classic or Import?<br/>6 Guys - If Jock is not to your liking, how about Vampire Chic?<br/>6 Gears - Do I go for the Jewelry or take the Dog?<br/>24 Gossip - Hand Me Down? Late Bloomer? Cruelty in card form.<br/>30 Specials - Remove Gossip or dramatically alter the game.<br/>50 Status - 10, 20, or 50 point cards to measure your popularity.<br/>And so we come to gameplay. I'll try to keep this simple. The players set what level of popularity they need to reach in order to win. Each turn you play from your hand to try to get Acquisitions (The Gear, The Guy, etc.) for yourself. Each one gives you 10 points each round toward that goal. But the other players can put Gossip on them. While an Acquisition has a Gossip card on it, it earns you nothing. Of course, turnabout is fair play, so you'll be attacking them with the same vicious rumors. The first to earn enough popularity while having all four Acquisitions in play with no Gossip on them takes over the Clique and rules the school.<br/><br/>Along the way, there are also unique cards to, for instance, prevent Gossip being played on your Car (My Daddy Owns A Dealership). It possible that everyone might lose their Guys in one fell swoop if someone should play Smoking In The Boys Room. The game can change dramatically from turn to turn. But isn't that the way with high school popularity? One day you are the queen, the next you are the outcast. Same goes for CLIQUE.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There Must Be No Competition, Before World Domination<br/><br/>In Hench: The Game, you take on the role of an evil mad scientist that has the means to rule the world, but so do a few others just like you! Before you can take over the world, you need to eliminate the competition.<br/><br/>Hench: The Game will be a simple card and dice game (recommended for 2-4 players). From your hand of 6 cards, you build your army of henchmen to protect you using Recruit Cards, and who will also do all your dirty work for you. You can strengthen your henchmen army by building enhancements to your secret hideout or equipping them with weapons. You can also attack, sabotage, defend yourself and many other things using Event Cards from your hand.<br/><br/>Basic gameplay will go like this:<br/><br/>1.As your turn begins, you may play a Recruit Card to play henchmen from your hand (but keeping some hidden in your hand may be beneficial to you later)<br/>2.You then can play one Enhancement, Weapon or Event card from your hand (see FAQ for card type explanation)<br/>3.If an Event card is played, instead of a Weapon or Enhancement card, then all effects from the card are resolved<br/>4.Draw back up to 6 cards.<br/>5.Next player's turn<br/><br/>If an Event card, such as Direct Attack or Provoked Attack, are played, then combat starts. How combat works is your opponent and yourself add up your &quot;Hench Power&quot;, which is +1 for each henchman you have in play, and any modifiers from Weapon or Enhancements in play. Each battling player then rolls one D6 and adds it to their &quot;Hench Power&quot;. Higher number wins, and the loser can either lose a location enhancement or half the difference between the &quot;Hench Power&quot; numbers (round up) in henchmen they have in play.<br/><br/>Some other Event cards would allow you to avoid a battle (but you end up losing a turn), forcing a battle between two other players, performing suicide attacks, etc.You lose when all of your henchmen are destroyed, and the last player standing wins the game, and the world!<br/><br/>",

Leave the leftover cards in a pile, they will be used soon.  Now.....<br/><br/>1. Let the sports event decide what cards to play by what is actually happening in the game. The goal is to dump all of your cards first. If the next play is running back running for 15+ yards and you have that card then you can play it. That is once less card you have to dump AND if that card you use is a + or - card then you get to dump more of your cards or have a player (or two) pick more cards up from the leftover pile. Its that simple.....AND FUN!!<br/><br/>2. Play your cards by predicting what will happen next in the game. The goal is to collect as many cards as possible. Before the next chance (inning, possession, break, etc...) each player chooses a play from the hand they are dealt. Place it face up so everyone knows whos playing what. When the first person who chose correctly wins then he/she gets to collect all the cards that were played. Plus if his/her card was a +/- card then she could get more cards from the leftover pile or they can choose the cards that other players have to dump. Trade cards are used as well and when you win with that card you get to pick a players card (blindly) to trade with your worst card. Its that simple....AND FUN!<br/><br/>***There are many other ways of playing GAME ON. Other luck games or harder games involving more skills and knowledge.***<br/><br/>Each sport has between 8-13 different plays in the deck. Some are rare but most are common plays.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wizard's Tournament<br/><br/>Every year, wizards from all over the realm come together to fight over the title of Archmage to become the most powerful wizard in the world.  Wizard's Tournament is a fantasy deck building game of magic combat where two players attempt to defeat each other using spells, monsters, and relics.  The game comes with thirty-five different sets of cards but only twelve of these card sets are picked at random to be used during a game.  These cards are added to a player's deck during a game so every time you play, it will feel like a new and exciting game.<br/><br/>Spell Cards<br/>Spell cards allow a player to perform special actions including dealing damage, drawing cards, healing, and causing an opponent to discard cards.  When cast, the ability of a Spell card occurs once and then it is discarded.  Fast spells can be played at any time but regular spells can only be cast on the owner's turn.  Spell cards can also be discarded to add Spirit to your Spirit Pool.<br/><br/>Monster Cards<br/>Monsters are permanent creatures used to attack your opponent and defend you from enemy monsters.  Every monster has a special ability that makes them more dangerous and difficult to defeat.<br/><br/>Relic Cards<br/>These permanent artifacts give a player special abilities that allow them to perform an action every turn until they are destroyed or stolen.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>Each player starts with thirty Life.  If a player reduced his opponent's Life to zero, he wins the game.  A player can also win by having thirty or more Spirit in his Spirit Pool or by having one hundred or more Life.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with ten Spirit cards.  Twelve cards are drawn from the Selection deck and these twelve card sets are placed on the table.  The starting player is determined randomly.   Before play begins, the player that is going first draws one card and the player going second draws three cards.<br/><br/>There are three possible icons on the each card: Green, Blue, and Red.<br/><br/>Green Icons: This is the Cast cost to activate a Spell, Monster, or Relic card.  This is also the purchase price in Spirit to add this card to a player's discard pile.<br/><br/>Blue Icons: This is the amount of Spirit added to a player's Spirit Pool when a card with a blue icon is discarded without activating it.<br/><br/>Red Icons: Monster cards have red icons equal to its Power.  A monster's Power is equal to a monster's Life and the amount of damage it can deal to a player or another monster.<br/><br/>Turn Sequence - 5 Phases<br/><br/>Draw Phase<br/><br/>A player draws five cards from her deck.  A player may never have more than ten cards in her hand at any time.  If a player cannot draw a card because her deck has run out of cards, the player must shuffle her discard pile into a new deck.<br/><br/>Purchase Phase<br/><br/>During any phase, Spirit cards or Spell cards can be discarded to add Spirit to a player's Spirit Pool equal to the number in the blue icon on the card.  This Spirit can be spent to purchase any of the twelve cards in the center of the table.  To add a card to your discard pile, you must pay the value in the card's green icon in Spirit.  Only one copy of each card can be purchased each turn.<br/><br/>Magic Phase<br/><br/>Players can spend Spirit to cast Spell, Monster, and Relic cards.  When Spell cards are cast, their ability is performed once and then they are discarded.  When Monster and Relic cards are cast, they are placed in play with an Activation token. Relics and monsters can use their abilities during the Magic and Combat phases.  An Activation token is placed on a relic when it is activated.  Relics and monsters with an Activation token cannot be activated.<br/><br/>Combat Phase<br/><br/>A Monster card can be used to attack another player or defend you from an attacking monster.  Monsters with an Activation token on them cannot attack, defend, or use their ability.  To attack, select all the monsters under your control that you want to attack.  Your opponent then decides which of his monsters will defend against each of the attacking monsters.  More than one monster can be used to block a single attacking monster.  After the attack, place an Activation token on each of the attacking monsters.<br/><br/>If a monster attacks and is not blocked, the defending player&rsquo;s Life is reduced by the Power of that monster.  If a monster is blocked by a defending monster, both monsters deal damage equal to their Power to his opponent.  If a monster's damage is ever equal to or greater than its Power, it is destroyed and placed in its owner&rsquo;s discard pile.  If a defending monster cannot absorb all this damage, the excess damage is applied to the defending player.  Excess damage applied to an attacking monster is ignored.<br/><br/>If more than one monster is used to block a single attacking monster, the attacking player may apply damage equal to the Power of the attacking monster divided amongst any the defending monsters in any way.  Any of these defending monsters that receive enough damage to be destroyed are placed in his owner&rsquo;s discard pile.  If a group of blocking monsters cannot absorb all the damage, the player that controls them has his Life reduced by the excess damage.  All the Power of the blocking monsters are combined and applied to the attacking monster.  If the damage dealt is equal to or greater than the Power of the attacking monster&rsquo;s Power, the attacking monster is destroyed and placed in its owner&rsquo;s discard pile and the excess damage is ignored.<br/><br/>End Phase<br/><br/>All Activation tokens are removed from play, all monster damage is discarded, and all Spirit Pools are emptied.<br/><br/>3 or 4 Player Optional Rules<br/><br/>The game can also be played with optional rules for three or four players when you use the extra Spirit cards included in the game.<br/><br/>Players: 2<br/><br/>Time: 30 Minutes<br/><br/>Ages: 12+<br/><br/>Contents: 292 Cards, Tokens, and a Rule Book<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game was created by Jennifer Diane Reitz to make part of her fictional universe of Pastel Defender Heliotrope.<br/><br/>It is based on the ancient game of latrunculi or latrunculorum, where players try to eliminate all the opponent's pieces using a &quot;flanking movement&quot; (i.e. pieces surrounding the captured piece in opposite sides). There's little information about movement of pieces, being suggested different ways.<br/><br/>Latrotabuli is a variant played in 12 x 6 retangular board and players have 12 latros and 1 centurion (acts as king). Latros can move any number of spaces in one of the cardinal directions whilst the Centurion can only move one space.<br/><br/>One particular feature of the game is the possibility of creating several formations to best deployment of pieces: the Testudo and the Phalanx. The testudo is a 4-piece square formation and phalanx is a 4-piece linear formation, in which pieces move as one.<br/><br/>The method of capture depends of the capturing formation (or lack of) and of the captured piece/pieces, and can be by approach, by flanking or by moving and replacing.<br/><br/>There's 3 victory conditions: <br/><br/>     capture all opponent latros (pieces)<br/>     capture the opponent centurion or,<br/>     when a player in the beginning of his turn can't move his centurion, he loses. <br/><br/><br/>",

Those pesky living ones however seem to want you dead, for real this time. Can you eat their brains before they destroy your rotting body? Find out if you have the right stuff come the Zombie Apocalypse.<br/><br/>ZAMB is a solo card game in which you have 2 decks, one is your play deck and the other is the Humans. You also have a set of cards to represent you the Zombie- which as you take damage changes your ability to draw cards and also effects your defence and offensive capabilities. Gameplay involves managing whatever the humans throw at you and using your hand/deck you try to defeat the game as more and more threats come into play. Picking the wrong option is deadly to the undead.<br/><br/>The Zombies over run the world and win if there are no more human cards left to play and yet your undead minion is still in (at least) one piece.<br/><br/>The game is a fast playing light card game which can also  be played as a 2 player format with one player taking control of the Humans.

Set around the Mad Hatter&rsquo;s table, players must dash around the Wonderland tea party while trying to figure out what secret rules govern the other players' movement.  The Mad Hatter character serves as both an audio guide and aid to chaos.<br/><br/>How do you play?<br/><br/>Each player has a secret rule.  When play begins, the Mad Hatter shouts out instructions about where to move around the table: &quot;Go sit at a tea cup,&quot; &quot;Take a seat next to the March Hare,&quot; &quot;Move one place counter-clockwise.&quot;  Players move their tokens accordingly, unless they find themselves in a situation where they must follow their secret rule instead.<br/><br/>Your goal is to guess what secret rules the other players are following.  If you can do so successfully, you are rewarded with buttons, and the first player to get fifteen buttons wins the game!<br/><br/>At first, the game might seem like madness, but once you get the hang of it you'll learn to use some strategy.  Watch the other players carefully and take note whenever they disobey the Hatter's direction - that's when you know they must be following their rule.  Each place around the table has two different states, and every state has two positions around the table.  When the Hatter tells you to sit next to the March Hare, a clever player will pick the spot next to the Hare that will best hide their secret rule.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Move Out (1971, ADA, $1.50), by Tom Kaeter, simulates man-to-man combat in Western Europe in 1944. It pits all or part of an American infantry platoon (31 men, 31 counters) against a German platoon (32 men, 32 counters). Each side has one of five possible missions as they enter the board from opposite sides. Upside down placement and blank counters are used to add the fog of war. The terrain includes brush, hills, woods, a creek, a pond and two small buildings, one with several rooms. The men have their separate weapons and also a number of individual differences. Some can see better, some run faster, some are sharp-shooters, and others experts at hand to hand combat. Unfortunately, it is a very unfinished game. The rules are hard to figure out and some are almost impossible to carry out. Things are particularly difficult when fighting develops around the buildings. The game is an offshoot of Terry Griner's Patrol, published as a set of rules in Strategy &amp; Tactics Nr. 7, and reading the rules in that source does help to figure out Move Out. Furthermore, the reproduction of the rules and map is quite poor. There are no counters, only pictures of counters and the pictures are hard to decipher. In spite of its faults however, Move Out offers something unusual and worthwhile for anyone who wants to investigate small unit tactics through a game. (Moves Magazine description)<br/><br/>",

Special cards--Switch Direction, Leap, and Wild Cards--introduce an element of surprise. Players race to get rid of their cards and be first to proclaim &quot;One of a Kind.&quot; For added excitement, the rules provide a way for quick-thinking players to jump in at the last minute and keep the game alive.<br/><br/>After each round of play, smiles abound--because kids are not only having fun but also feeling better about themselves.<br/><br/>",

The first player to do this is the winner.<br/><br/>The prizes are collected by moving the player pawns (four versions of Donald Duck) around the board by spinning a movement spinner until one player has landed on three &quot;prize&quot; spaces. The spinner is divided in to 4 quadrants numbered 1 to 4 with each one containing one square for each colored pawn that will determine the color of pawn to be moved and the number of spaces to move. While moving the player must read aloud what is written on the spaces as they pass them and perform any action that is in the space. For example &quot;Stand up and take a bow&quot; Once a player has landed on three prize spaces they are the winner. The winner must then do what the three prize tokens say.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a block that spells out ISRAEL.<br/><br/>Players roll a die to advance around the board.  The spaces on the board determine what question based on the bible the player has to answer.  A correct answer allows the player to roll again.  If the player lands on a space marked with the name of a biblical person and answers a question correctly they get a chip to place on their block.  There are spaces that give players the ability to remove a chip from other players or get a free chip. When a player has their block completely covered they must enter the Heaven space by an exact roll and answer a question correctly.  If the player answers the question correctly they win the game.  If the answer is incorrect the player must leave Heaven on the next turn and try again.<br/><br/>Essentially this is a rip-off of Trivial Pursuit.<br/><br/>",

Two to eight players evenly distribute a total of 100 puzzle pieces. Each has a printed letter along with four wild pieces. Begin by placing a puzzle piece on the table.  Start the timer.  Taking turns, each player adds a piece to the puzzle. How the puzzle expands is up to you.  Once every piece has been placed or time runs out, players pick up their pencils.   Start the timer again and find as many words as you can.  As long as the puzzle pieces are next to each other, any direction goes, however a player may not skip over a void in the puzzle to complete a word.  When time runs out, using the Worzle Scoring System, the points are tallied and the player with the most wins!<br/><br/>Worzle is the next progression in word games.  It combines the strategic component of building hidden words with the fast paced nature of finding as many as you can.  It is not as simple as you might imagine.  As the puzzle expands, pieces are placed in multiple directions leaving them upside down and sideways.  Each player around the puzzle has a unique perspective of the game. The &ldquo;building the puzzle&rdquo; dynamic adds huge interest to the game.<br/><br/>Worzle will be packaged in a printed drawstring cotton bag complete with a timer, several custom pads and pencils all in a full color box.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From South America to Central America to North America there are remnants of large civilizations that have disappeared leaving behind only the ruins of temples, city structures and fragmented settlements. The Ancient Americas are shrouded in mystery and intrigue. The people were religious with a fashionable culture. Their cities were the central hub to life and these civilizations enjoyed much abundance and prosperity all while in the midst of conflicts that were trying to destroy them.<br/><br/>General Rules<br/><br/>This game is for 2 to 4 players ages eight to adult. Players build a 'city of promise' by building their civilization with important structures and with valuable characters that then defend the city from corruption's power.<br/><br/>Building Cards - Throughout the deck are Building Cards. To build structures for the 'cities of promise' and to use important historical figures within the cities, a player  must try to collect specific cards and in the right amounts. Some cards cost more than others and the value of the cards vary in power. Players who gain the right building cards pay the cost of the card and a new part of the city is then added.<br/><br/>Game Timer - Corruption Cards play as timing cards and determine when the game ends. When the 18th Corruption Card is placed down the game ends for all players.<br/><br/>Each player add up their cities power points. If the total is greater than the total points of Corruption Power Points  then they have WON! Yes, that's right, there can be more than one winner in this game making it more rewarding for the whole family. And if the friendly competition is that HIGH you can find out who's city had the most strength and they can be the Grand Winner!<br/><br/>Types of Cards<br/><br/>Corruption Cards - New cards are drawn at the beginning of every turn. Any time a Corruption Card is drawn it must be played during the player's turn and added to the Corruption Card area (typically the middle between all players).<br/><br/>Building a City - Players that purchase City Cards with the Build Cards will be able to piece the city together in any combination left to right or right to left. As players strive to get the better City Cards it may be necessary to discard unwanted or undesirable City Cards in the hopes of gaining a better one on the next draw.<br/><br/>Specialty Characters - Character Cards can be added to your city by purchasing them with the Build Cards and then placing them under the correct City Card they belong to. These cards also have a power point value so players can seek to add the best characters to their city to give it the best advantage.<br/><br/>Bonus Power Points - Saints Cards, Resources Cards, and Faith &amp; Works Cards can be stored under Character Cards for later purchases of City Cards and Character Cards. Unused Build Cards can add additional power points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

Two to six players make their way around the board beginning at Death and navigating through cemeteries and pitfalls trying to build up their stash of personal burial plots and even adding tombstones and mausoleums so they can charge more for other players standing on their grave. The &ldquo;Fate&rdquo; and &ldquo;Communal Coffin&rdquo; cards are hysterical. But beware the devil in one corner; he will send you straight to the fire. <br/>Players advance with the roll of the black dice, paying bones to the bone collector or taking in bones for fees, and the game ends when one player is the last to have bones.<br/><br/>A lot of cultures celebrate the dead with holidays like Halloween, Day of the Dead, and All Souls Day. This game is great for all ages and takes perhaps the scariest thing in life and makes it a fun and competitive adventure. The entire family will get into the spirit and will be laughing out loud.<br/><br/>",

A Prince moves up or down on a dice throw of 1 or 4. Moves right or left on a throw of 2 or 5, and diagonally on a throw of 3 or 6. A player places a Dominion Marker on all squares stopped on by his Prince, and no other player may trespass on that territory when so marked. This limits the squares a Prince may move to making and unusual situation, and calling for increasing skill as the game progresses.<br/><br/>The person starting is determined by high roll. Turn moves to the left. Each player starts from his Corner Castle and is given a Prince, 30 Dominion Markers, and a die. Each player in turn rolls and places a Dominion Marker where the Prince lands. The first objective is to move to and place Dominion Markers on five Noble Squares (indicated by a purple board square with a white center). Then with the support of these five Nobles the Prince moves toward the Throne Space at the other side of the board. The first Prince to enter a Throne Space earns the right to wear the Royal Purple (wins).<br/><br/>The game plays like a cross between popular games of the day Chess and Halma with a roll and move mechanic added. A number of &quot;Go To&quot; squares on the board jumping players ahead to another square are an added twist.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Promotional game made by Black Cat cigarettes. It consists of 28 cards, but only 14 cards are used in any one game. Several games should be played to find a winner.<br/><br/>One player is elected Banker. He starts the Pool by placing 6 counters into it. He then shuffles and deals 14 cards face down. All the other players now place a bet (counters, not real money) on any card they wish. No more than one can bet on any one card. When all bets are placed, the first card is drawn. The player who bet on it must follow the instructions.<br/><br/>If the Banker role changes hands, a new deal shall be started. But Note: Sometimes a player's call against the Bank cannot be met. The deficiency is made up as far as possible from the Reserve. Then the Bank is 'broken' and the Bank role is transferred to the player on the Banker's left. This player starts a new Bank by putting in the 6 counters that are required.<br/><br/>Cards are:<br/>One In, Two In, etc. = Player puts counters into the Pool<br/>One Out, Two Out, etc. = Player takes out counters from the Pool<br/>Reserve = Every player puts 1 counter into the Bank Reserve. This Reserve is set aside in a special pool, for use on special occasions. It transfers when the Bank is transferred, and only withdraws when Bank Holiday is turned.<br/>Official Receiver = When turned, the Bank and Reserve (if any) transfers to the player who has backed the card, but that player pays over to the retiring Banker counters equal to the number then in the Pool (but not counting in the Reserve). The Banker taking over shall not scoop the Pool, which stays untouched and the game proceeds.<br/>Distribution = When revealed, every player, including the Banker, receives a counter from the Pool.<br/>Contribution = Every player, including Banker, puts a counter into the Pool.<br/>Scoop = The player backing this card scoops the entire Bank, which now transfers to him. The Reserve remains untouched. He starts a new Bank with 6 counters.<br/>Stake = This gives an advantage to the last player to have put down a stake of 6 counters to start a Bank. He claims 6 counters from the player who backed this card. The current Banker usually will be the one who staked the 6 counters into the Pool, but if a new Banker takes over because of the Official Receiver card or the Transfer Bank card (neither of which do not require 6 counters being paid into the Pool, so the player who benefits by this card will be the previous Banker perhaps).<br/>Transfer Bank = The Bank transfers to the player who backed this card, but its capital cannot be increased or the Reserve interfered with.<br/>Bank Holiday = The Bank's Scoop card. When revealed, the Bank scoops both Bank and Reserve, and starts a new Bank with a stake of 6 counters.<br/><br/>",

Then they decide which outrageous definition is correct.<br/><br/>Deceive and Decide contains 1000 obscure words complete with pronunciations which are known only to the poker-faced Word Master.  Each player concocts his own whacky definition and the Word master reads them all allowed, including the real one.  The players vote on the definition that seems most plausable - and everyone wins.<br/><br/>The game goes 'round the table at a razzle-dazzle pace as each player yakes his turn at Word Master.  The definitions range from ludicrous to bizarre - if you can stop laughing long enough, you may even want to add up the score.<br/><br/>Imagine creating defintiions for words such as:<br/><br/>Beccabunga<br/>Gardyloo<br/>Dorking<br/>Xylophonist&quot;<br/><br/>This game sounds similar to Balderdash, but there is no board and the card layout and playing equipment is quite different.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Space Flick is the placeholder name for a tactical space combat game. In Space Flick, up to five players represent the elite captains of small star nations. Those nations have just learned that the evil empire that dominates their area of the galaxy is engaged in a major conquest, leaving behind only a fraction of their fleet for defense. The captains decide to launch a daring raid on the heart of the enemy, hoping to destroy a key space station integral to its military efforts. If they succeed, their worlds may be free; failure would be bad.<br/><br/>Bad, unless you're the person playing the evil empire.<br/><br/>Space Flick plays through a series of encounters as the captains move closer to their goal, culminating in a final battle. Game play is fast-paced and easy to learn. Movement and combat is resolved by flicking discs across the playing surface.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "851 Baseball uses pitching and batting statistics in tandem to simulate the game of baseball on a well-crafted gameboard that depicts a baseball field laid out in a grid pattern. The game comes with 10 fictional teams, each consisting of 20 fictional players (13 position players and 7 pitchers). Each position player is rated for batting average and power versus both left-handed and right-handed pitchers, plus speed, arm strength, and fielding ability. Each pitcher is rated for opponents' batting average, along with strikeouts and walks against both left-handed and right-handed batters.<br/><br/>The outcome of an at bat is determined by rolling dice and consulting the pitching card. If the pitching card indicates that the batter made contact (fly ball, line drive, or ground ball), the batting card is then checked against the result of another dice roll to determine where and how far the ball is hit.<br/><br/>The batted ball is plotted on the gameboard with the built-in batting stick. Defensive players, who were positioned on the playing field grid, attempt to make a play on the batted ball. Depending upon their initial positioning, their speed, their fielding ability, and in some cases their arm strength, the result may be a base hit, an out, or an error.<br/><br/>The appeal of 851 Baseball is that it depicts the movement of the ball, defensive players, and baserunners as each play unfolds. For example, a line drive might be caught by an outfielder or it might find the gap and roll to the wall. Baserunners advance according to their speed and can be instructed to try to take an extra base.<br/><br/>Multiple dice rolls can be required to fully resolve the outcome of an at bat, but play moves relatively quickly and the visual element sets this game apart from most other baseball boardgames.<br/><br/>The game comes with gameboard and batting stick, 5 dice (4 six-sided and 1 twenty-sided), color-coded playing pieces, rule book, 10 batting cards, 10 pitching cards, a pad of scoresheets, all attractively packaged in a game box.<br/><br/>",

Trivia questions will have the player knit rows for correct answers, and rip out stitched rows (frogging, for knitters out there) for wrong answers.  Some cards require challenges to add rows, such as knitting with eyes closed.  Other cards involve words, such as scrambled words, or listing knitting terms, where the amount answered adds rows.

There is a special star-dot-star side on the die, and if rolled the player gets to ask a question (of their choice of categories) to the &quot;opposing&quot; players.  If the players answer correctly they stay on their current location; if they answer the question incorrectly, they each roll the die and move back the indicated number of spaces.<br/><br/>The Category Headquarter keys must be landed on with an exact roll and cannot be passed until you answer the question correctly.  The Winner space must also be landed on with an exact roll.<br/><br/>The trivia categories are Hardware, Software, People &amp; Companies, History, and Potpourri (miscellaneous).<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>1 - Computer Trivia fold out playing board<br/>2 - Volumes of trivia questions &amp; answers<br/>2 - Computer Trivia book marks<br/>4 - Playing pieces<br/>1 - Computer Trivia die<br/><br/>",

The prophesied apocalypse is happening and the final battle between Good and Evil will decide the fate of the universe. Governments and social order have all fallen apart and the barriers of reality are broken. Great fissures have opened up across the earth, opening up gateways to Hell.

Fortunately for them, the skies have opened up, revealing the Gates to Heaven. Warrior Angels descend to provide assistance but the battle is to be decided by the people. If Good wins, Hell can be closed forever and everlasting peace will reign. The Demons refuse to be trapped in Hell for eternity and prefer to destroy existence.

Is the loyalty of the Police suspect? Will the locally based army units defect? Can control of the broadcasting station be neutralised bv seizure of the newspaper offices? Is the underground railway in reliable hands? Can the deadly power of the air force be rendered ineffective by jamming its operational wavelength? Should all electric power be cut off, and if so for how long? etc. etc.<br/><br/>The fascination of Coup d'Etat is the way in which these and many other questions are resolved; each solution itself has an immediate effect on the course of the battle and produces the next tactico- militarv problem.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rare game. The board has different coloured lanes, one for each horse. In your turn, you throw the three dice. Move a horse that matches a number, e.g. you roll a 3, 4 and 5. Horse numbered 3, 4 and 5 move one space. If a number is rolled twice, that horse moves 2 spaces. If a number is rolled thrice, that horse moves 3 spaces. If a horse gets to the space before the finish line, it must roll a double to cross the line. That is it. Not the most skilful game I have ever seen!!<br/><br/>The rules allow for three variants, the Regular Race (as described above), the Slow Race (the horse that is last to finish, wins the race, and a hurdle race which is played just like the Regular Game except that when you reach a fence, you have to roll a double to get over it.<br/><br/>The publishers suggest that you may use the contents and create your own variants. I suggest, for a start, have some betting before the race. At least that would make the game a little more exciting.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a card driven horse racing game.  The majority of the included cards have one of the horse's number. First, the cards are shuffled and a number of them are dealt to the &quot;Odds&quot; area of the board and are used with a set of dials to determine the odds for each horse. The players then place their bets. Then the cards are dealt to the race part of the board that has very nice pictures of happy looking horses ready to run.  The first horse to have 5 of its cards dealt from the deck for a 5 furlong race is the winner. The horses need one card per furlong to win a race.  Cards can be added to the deck that cause horses to run slow for a race, thus requiring an addition card.  Cards can be added to the deck that represent a horse not clearing a hedge row in a steeple chase race. There is an alternate way of running a race included.  Running times for each horse are assigned via a chart that uses the quantity of the horse's cards that are turned up to determine that running time.  In this race the lowest time is the winner.  Each game consists of a set of three races and during the set one player represent the Racing Committee or &quot;The House&quot;.  Under certain circumstances this player receives the purse and in others he must add to the purse from his own money.  The similarities between Pace and And They're Off leads one to believe that Pace was used as the bases for <a target='_blank' href=\"http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3112/and-theyre-off\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3112/and-theyre-off</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Concept<br/><br/>Hollywood Hookups is the first trivia game that links celebrities through biographical facts. The connections are real. And so are the celebrities. The concept of the game is very simple - you are given the names of two individuals that both dated or were married to the same person. You will have to come up with the name of the middle person. Hollywood Hookups links all kinds of celebrities - actors and actresses, musicians, athletes, and royalty. The trivia questions are in 3 different categories, and span the contemporary era to early 20th century.<br/><br/>The Game<br/><br/>The actual board game consists of a board, more than 500 question cards, 50 tokens, 1 die and 6 colored game pieces (red, yellow, blue, green, pink and orange). This is a family-friendly game for 2 to 6 players, ages 13 and up. The object of the game is to collect tokens by answering trivia questions correctly. The first player to get 8 tokens wins the game. This game can either be a single-player game, or it can be played in teams of 2 or 3. We really like the design of the board - the maroon color of the board contrasts nicely with the gold accents. The outside of the box has a white background, with more than 30 different celebrity names on the box - Marilyn Monroe, Tom Cruise, Britney Spears, to name a few.<br/><br/>The Question Cards<br/><br/>The questions come in 3 different categories - Modern, Classic and Connect 3. The Modern cards have questions about contemporary celebrities; the Classic cards have questions about classic (old Hollywood) celebrities. Both of those types of cards only have one celebrity as the answer. The Connect 3 cards have contemporary celebrities, but the connection involves 3 different celebrities. These questions are much harder, but we're sure you're up to the challenge! Please see the designs below.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spinca is a game that embraces the Shibumi ideal that less is more. It is a 2 or 3-player game and can be played with a Series: Shibumi set. The winning conditions vary slightly for the 2 and 3-player games; however, the game play is the same for both versions.  Naturally, team play is also possible.<br/><br/>At game&rsquo;s end, a pyramid of 29 marbles is created, which resembles an Inca temple. The peak level is not used.<br/><br/>The board starts empty. Players choose a color and take the corresponding marbles. Player turns proceed clockwise. Herein, the order is assumed to be White, Black, and possibly Red.<br/><br/>Starting with White, using the phase order below:<br/>1.    A player may move any free marble on the board to any adjacent (orthogonal or diagonal) hole or 2x2 platform which is on the same level as the marble.<br/><br/>A free marble is any marble that does not support two or more marbles in the level above it, and will not cause to move any marble that was moved or placed on the previous player&rsquo;s turn. This includes tumble-downs. And,<br/><br/>2.    A player must place one of his or her marbles on any empty space or 2x2 platform on the board. This completes the player&rsquo;s turn.<br/> Any marble that was relocated, tumbled down or was placed is temporarily locked for the following player&rsquo;s turn. The virtual Shibumi Sandbox implementation at  igGameCenter at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.iggamecenter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.iggamecenter.com/</a>, has moved marbles marked with a plus sign. Nice and convenient. For physical game board play, players will have to keep tract of their last moves by recording them.<br/><br/>When the Inca temple is completed, each player sums the sizes of the smallest of his or her connected groups on each of the four faces of the pyramid. Each of the four faces will yield only one number. For example, if on one face of the temple, a player had group sizes of 1, 1 and 3, the player would only score 1 for that face. The marbles on the pyramid&rsquo;s rising edges are considered part of both of the adjacent faces making them strategically important because they are potentially counted twice!. However, an isolated edge marble can ruin a player&rsquo;s score.<br/><br/>For a 2-player or 4-player game, the player or team with the highest sum wins. If there is a tie, remove the outer faces to reveal the inner pyramid. The player or team with the most marbles in the inner pyramid wins the game.<br/> For a 3-player game, the player with the highest sum wins. If there is a two-way tie, the player with the lowest sum wins. If there is a three way tie, remove the outer faces to reveal the inner pyramid. Players score the inner pyramid by counting all their visible marbles once each. The player with the highest inner total wins. If there is a two-way tie for the inner totals, the player with the lowest total wins.<br/><br/>",

A copy of PanzerBlitz is required in order to play.<br/><br/>Six of the scenarios are based on historical actions, all of them Polish successes(!), including a couple of cavalry victories (but no charges into the barrels of tanks). Two of the four hypothetical scenarios are designed to show the superiority of combined arms tactics over uncoordinated assaults. One interestingly pits panzers against an armored train.

        "description": "A dark and mysterious blight has come to the Great Kingdom of the Mystic World. There has been no hint of sun for 500 days. With the people starving, the king turns to his four court magicians to cast an ancient spell known as the &ldquo;Lichten Spell&rdquo; which will again turn their kingdom to light. The first magician to cast the spell correctly will become the Great Court Magician and a hero of the Kingdom.<br/><br/>In order to cast the spell a magician must follow the recipe. The balance of Elements needed to cast the spell changes with the wind and from moment to moment. The four magicians now race to determine the precise mixture of elements and be the first to cast the spell correctly.<br/><br/>The game begins with an auction for each of the Elements. As play begins, each player makes three moves per turn, spending their Elements to both learn and change the requirements for victory.<br/><br/>The Lichten Spell requires many skills to win. It is one part bidding game to obtain precious Elements. It is one part mystery as players race to identify face-down cards. It is one part strategic thinking as players try to figure out three moves which will leave them with the proper amounts of Elements to win the game. Most of all, The Lichten Spell is a thought-provoking battle where no two games are the same!<br/><br/>",

In the game, you are a Colonel of a Brigade Combat Team trying to drive through OPFOR forces into the enemy rear.  If you are sufficiently successful, you may be promoted to General.  If not, you could lose your command.<br/>   To play, 9 OPFOR defense cards are played facedown in a 3X3 pattern. The player then selects from a variety of FRAGO cards which offensive operation he wants to use to find a path thru the defensive lines. Each FRAGO lists the type of operation, combat strength, and the number of game-hours to complete the operation.  The player has to find, or fight, his way thru the defense in less than 20 game-hours.  <br/>   If the player completes the breakthrough in less than 20 game-hours, he retains his command.  If he can do it in 16 or less game-hours, he is promoted.  If it takes longer than the alloted time, the player loses command.<br/><br/>",

What is a pig to do&hellip;.<br/><br/><br/>Straw, Sticks and Bricks (SSB) is a resource management game geared toward children, but still providing a challenge for adults.  It uses familiar characters and simple mechanics to engage your children.  Honing skills of matching, set collecting, turn taking, negotiating and counting &ndash; it is a perfect introductory challenge for children, and great for family game night.<br/><br/>The game is broken into three phases, in which all players take actions, so as to minimize the down time for players, keeping everyone engaged throughout.<br/><br/>In the first phase players take turns spinning the resource wheel and collecting building supplies (Straw, Sticks or Bricks) &ndash; or encountering the housing inspector (Mr Wolf), who may condemn one of the recently built homes.<br/><br/>The next phase allows the players to trade the recently acquired building supplies with each other, hopefully to their mutual advantage.<br/><br/>For the final phase, players use their hard won resources to build homes in their housing developments &ndash; and once a development is full and ready to open, points are totaled and a winner (or winners) is determined.<br/><br/><br/>The game was created as an entry for TGC Resource Contest.<br/><br/><br/>",

The game's theme calls to mind constellations and stellar navigation.<br/><br/>Utara makes use of several dice that in each face says either North, East, South, or West. The fifth face has a Sun and the sixth face is Moon. You can use any number of dice to play, with a minimum of ten dice per player. More dice will allow higher scores, possibly longer games and require more space to play.<br/><br/>Give the playing surface directions, meaning north, south, east and west. Players roll their dice on the playing surface at the same time. Pick one player to start randomly. The player chooses a die with a cardinal direction in it, and moves it in the direction of its face up. When meeting another dice, collect it and change directions to match the new dice face. Continue in this manner until you go out of bounds. Then the next player does the same thing and so on.<br/><br/>The game ends when no more North, East, South or West dice remain. Each player scores one point for every die in their collection.<br/><br/>It is best to play a few rounds of Utara, once for each participating player. The player who had the fewest points in the previous round should take the first turn in the next round, so they have an opportunity to catch up. Points are tallied over a series of rounds to determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

You score two points for each family member that escaped (each card in the central, shared, scoring area). Each family member left in the house, or dead is worth -1 point.<br/><br/>Players can use their escape routes to get people out of the house before they finally make their escape into the central scoring area. Players place vehicle cards in the center to start piles of escaping family members (the number on the card must go up one each time you place a new family member on the pile).<br/><br/>When zombies appear, they eat whoever is next to them in the deck, but if you've equipped one of the members of your family with a shotgun, you can put the zombie in the dead pile (with any already-dead family members) and save a life.<br/><br/>Plays from 2-6 players, plays best with 3-6.

Players work to change the color of the globe from red to green by correctly answering questions about various environmental topics, learning which technologies are more &ldquo;green&rdquo; in order to invest in them and reacting to natural events. Beyond just teaching facts about the environment and global climate change, the game is set up to encourage thinking about how your actions affect the whole world and how what we do now will affect our future. Game-play also requires players to work together to improve the globe&rsquo;s color, demonstrating how we must all work together to help slow the effects of global climate change.<br/><br/>",

If they choose to gather resources a die is rolled to determine how much they gain.

In the game, players take on the roles of a mercenary organization, the Champions of Indines, that travel around their world searching for powerful enemies to fight and people in need to protect. Each game is called an encounter, and takes around two hours to play from start to finish (though some encounters might be longer or shorter). The larger team of players form the Heroes--individual characters who work together to fight as a group. The other team is comprised of a Boss--a single player who controls one exceptionally powerful character or a number of minions (or some combination in between).&quot;<br/><br/>The game is available now as a print-and-play from the official website. Players are encouraged to print the game, play it, and give feedback.<br/><br/>Many of the characters from Champions of Indines also appear in BattleCON. Though the two games are not related in terms of gameplay, they do take place in the same world and follow similar storylines.<br/><br/>",

It does not include any new types of cards or components, new rules, or anything else that changes the game-play.<br/><br/>Hamsterdam is a primarily card-based game, where each player gets a set of 11 numbered &quot;dam&quot; cards, a set of 20 identical regular &quot;hamster&quot; cards and 2 &quot;special&quot; hamster cards drawn from a deck of 16 (which includes 2 each of 8 special types of hamsters).<br/><br/>The Hamsterdam 5-6 Player Expansion includes 2 additional sets of dam cards, 2 additional 20-card regular-hamster decks, and an 8-card specialty hamster deck including 1 of each type.<br/><br/>The expansion does not include other components needed to play the game (flood tokens, dice), thus it cannot be used as a stand-alone game.<br/><br/><br/>Game-play of Hamsterdam when incorporating this expansion proceeds exactly as the base game does: Players create a &quot;dam&quot; made up of a line of cards numbered 2 through 12 and distribute their hamster cards (20 regular + 2 special) on top of the numbered cards. Players take turns rolling 2 d6 to see which spot in the dam is weakened. If a hamster is on top of that number, that hamster is used to plug to the hole and is placed to the side in a reserve pile to come back into play in the next round. If a hamster is not on that number, a flood token is placed there until the end of the round, at which time it can be removed by taking a hamster card permanently out of play. If a flood token is already located on a number that is rolled, another flood token is placed in a special pile of tokens belonging to that player which cannot be removed. As flood tokens pile up, your stock of hamster saviors dwindles, and flood tokens pile up all the faster. The game ends when any player accumulates 10 flood tokens (counting both those in the permanent pile and those currently on the dam). The winner is the player with the fewest flood tokens. In the case of a tie, the player with the most remaining hamster cards wins.<br/><br/>",

However, the tactical properties of the irregular boundary majorly affect gameplay:  for example, there are places where it is possible to create an eye by playing only one stone.  Also, because the Milton Keynes board (77 points) is much smaller than even the reduced-size 13&times;13 Go board (169 points), the game is much shorter.<br/><br/>This game was created as a side event at the 2001 Milton Keynes Go Tournament, and subsequently made available on the Web as print-and-play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "War Games is a strategy board game based on the Doctor Who series of the same name, which originally aired in 1969. Players take the roles of War Lords, a race of aliens who have abducted human soldiers from across time in order to build an army to conquer the universe. One player controls the Doctor, who is striving to foil their plans. Players fight each other, capture territory, and form alliances through an engaging, card-based combat system that emphasizes skill and strategy over luck. Eventually though, the Time Lords have to be called in, and the game changes into a fast-paced capture the flag style race to get to the TARDIS and escape before they arrive.<br/><br/>Each turn, players take three actions by playing a card for each action. Playing cards in this way allows players to move, attack other generals and their bases, fortify their bases, or use strong utility actions or delayed tactical responses. The Doctor can influence zone bases to join the Resistance and otherwise interfere with the general's plans.<br/><br/>During play there are several War Chief cards that provide environmental effects when they are face-up. These cards become face-up or face-down due to actions in the game such as forcing another player to be your lieutenant or capturing zones. The game proceeds to the second phase when one player controls the majority of zones or all the War Chief cards are face-up or face-down.<br/><br/>In the second phase of the game, action is faster, as each player plays one action at a time and moves, and doesn't draw any cards to replace their hand. Players fight over the key to the TARDIS and race to escape the world they're on before the Time Lords arrive.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Described as &quot;A Game for the Black-Out&quot;, so that dates it to the early 1940's.<br/><br/>It is for two players. Each player gets a board with a 5 x 5 grid on it. The first player selects a letter from the 250 provided and announces it. Both players must now write it into one of the 25 squares on their board. Then the next player draws a tile and both players must now fit that into their grid. Once a letter is placed, it cannot be changed.<br/><br/>The object is to score the most points. Points are rewarded with a specific score, which increase as the length of the word increases. A perfect game would be 5 five-letter words across and 5 five-letter words downwards. I suspect, that would have an absolutely zero chance of happening.<br/><br/>Back to the box - it also says &quot;More Entertaining than Crosswords&quot; and &quot;An Ideal Fireside Game&quot;.<br/><br/>",

The first player challenges the player to their left with 1-5 cards of the same rank from their hand. The player answering the challenge can either surrender or try and OutRank each card with a card from their hand of the same suit and higher rank. The answering player may choose to surrender at any time by picking up all cards in play and adding them to their hand. All other players are in a support phase and have the option of supporting a challenge with cards from their hand which have the same rank as cards already in play. If all the challenging cards are answered and there are no other cards being played then the cards in play are removed from the game. The player who was answering becomes the new attacker and play continues clockwise. A game is over when a player has used all of the cards in their hand.<br/><br/>",

The slope or ramp is made in two halves; join these together and fit into the slots in the uprights, but before securing to the highest upright, thread the Duck on the ramp.

When this has been accomplished fire the remaining bands on the gun to knock over the Duck before it reaches the &quot;Home&quot; pen.<br/><br/>Scoring is calculated according to the number of points indicated by the duck's head on the base board when it is pointing downwards,<br/><br/>If a player has some remaining bands on his gun after scoring, the Duck is returned to the starting pen for further play.<br/><br/>",

The two players sit opposite each other. The sphere in front of each player represents their respective flag (or, in this case, &quot;phlag&quot;). The spheres in the middle represent a wall. These four spheres cannot be moved.<br/><br/>Movement rules:<br/>Two players, White and Black, take turns either placing a sphere of their color within their half of the game board (the half facing the player, e.g. anywhere within the triangle B7-G2-G7 for the lower player, and A6-F1-A1 for the upper player), in any level possible, or by moving their sphere up to a total of 4 spaces. No spheres can be initially placed along the diagonal line indicated by the wall (A7-G1), or the opponent&rsquo;s half, although spheres can be moved into these positions.<br/>A &quot;space&quot; is defined as a space on the grid (not the holes). This means that moving from one hole to the next (for example, E7-C7) involves moving 2 spaces. Player movements may involve movements up or down levels. If a sphere that supports only one other sphere is moved, the top sphere drops down into the vacated hole. If a sphere supports more than one other sphere, it is locked into place.<br/><br/>Other rules:<br/>The last turn's board position cannot be repeated (ko rule). Passing is allowed. If a player cannot make a legal move, the player passes.<br/><br/>Aim:<br/>Players aim to touch their opponent&rsquo;s flag with as many of their own spheres as possible. There are three legal positions at which an opponent&rsquo;s flag can be &quot;touched&quot;; E7, F6, G5 for the lower flag, and A3, B2, C1 for the upper flag.<br/><br/>Winning conditions:<br/>Players win instantly upon moving at least two of their spheres into touching contact with the opponent&rsquo;s flag. Otherwise, the game ends when both players pass sequentially or if both players agree to end the game. The player that has more spheres touching the opponent&rsquo;s flag after ending the game wins. In case of a draw with respect to the number of spheres touching the opponent&rsquo;s flag, the player with fewer spheres on the board wins. If both players have identical numbers of spheres touching their opponent&rsquo;s flag, and equal numbers of spheres in the game, the game ends in a draw.<br/><br/>Examples of legal moves are shown in the files section.<br/><br/>Designed by Lars Rose, 2011.<br/><br/>",

The game was designed by a Tartu Hiie school children and they presented it in 2005 for the named competition. All the art were made by a local school girl Cathlyn Olev (from Viimsi High 7th grade).<br/><br/>In the Tartu Hiie school all children there wither have a hearing or seeing disability. They say about the game they made like this:<br/><br/>&quot;It was really hard to find the idea for the game at first. We looked at many different types of games and finally we thought to make something like Monopoly, but simpler. We thought, that a usual dice game with questions would be simple enough for us to do. We thought up the questions and made the cards. So that we wouldn't have to know all the answers, we made few cards with answers already on them, so we could move forward and backwards as well. The goal of the game is to learn about consuming and how to do it with reason!&quot;<br/><br/>Game is played with dice rolls and answering questions. First person to reach the end, will win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Abstract: <br/>A strategy game for two players in which each attempts to control the most space on the hexagonal table by placing and flipping coins.<br/><br/>Overview:<br/><br/>Board: A hexagonal board divided up into a number of hexagons, resembing a honeycomb. Standard board size has 61 hexagon spaces measuring 1.25 inch across arranged in a hexagon shape, with each side of the board the length of five hexagon spaces and the middle of the board being nine hexagon spaces wide if measured between any two opposite corners. Non standard boards may be used, as long as the shape is a true hexagon.<br/><br/>Pieces: 100 coins with distinctive heads and tails markings. Standard coins are the same size and weight as US pennies, with each face painted a distinctive color. <br/>Coins may also be used in place of standard game coins.<br/><br/>Objective: to control the most spaces on the hexagonal board.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/>1. For two players. Players alternate turns. Each player chooses a color or coin face On a player's turn, he may do one of the following:<br/><br/>A: place a coin on any space on the hexagon spaces on the board, with his own color or his own face up.<br/><br/>B: touch a coin that is already on the board. see &quot;touching a coin&quot;<br/><br/>C: Flip a coin of his opponents over to his own color(or face). see &quot;flipping a coin&quot;<br/><br/>D: make a castle. see &quot;making a castle&quot;.<br/><br/>2. The last coin that has been put on the board, flipped, or touched cannot be flipped. It is &quot;safe&quot; until another coin has been put on the board, touched or flipped.<br/><br/>3. The game ends when all spaces on the board are filled. Count up the number of spaces each player controls. The player who controls the most spaces wins.<br/><br/>TOUCHING A COIN<br/>On your turn, if you choose, you may touch a coin with your finger. That coin cannot be flipped until another coin has been touched, flipped, or put on the board. Use this to defend a coin for one turn.<br/><br/>FLIPPING A COIN<br/>A coin of an opponents color may be flipped to your color if These criteria are met:<br/>A: You have two coins of your color/face on hexagonal spaces adjoining the coin you want to flip<br/>B: The coin is not &quot;safe&quot;(has been put on the board, flipped, or touched on the opponent's most recent turn.<br/>C: The coin is not part of a castle.<br/><br/>MAKING A CASTLE:<br/>If there are three coins of your color on adjoining spaces arranged in a triangle, you can place a coin on top of those three to make a castle*. Now these coins cannot be flipped for the entire game. A coin can be part of more than one castle, as long as the coin making the castle is placed on top of three coins on the board.<br/><br/>    Note that only one coin may be flipped or placed per turn. A castle will take a minimum of 4 turns to build. <br/><br/><br/>",

To do so you have to give orders to your crew so that they can create opportunities to attack, defend and take water out of the ship.<br/><br/>This is achieved through blind-bidding. Each turn the players hide their boards using the provided shields and bid on the several actions and functions (attack and drain water out of the boat) so that they can gain more resources or affect the other players's bids. Then they all reveal the boards and compare their bids. Only one player solves each action so be sure to pay extra for the ones you want. At the end of the turn the ships sink according to the amount of water the players let into the boat.<br/><br/>",

The game is to see how many things you can find that begin with a different letter of the alphabet. I think it was intended to be played in the car on a long journey. So, after a pre-agreed time limit, the first player must pass the picture over to the next player, probably in the seat next to him or her, and that player must see if they can find more than the first player, and so on, until everyone in the car (hopefully not including the driver) has had a turn. The board suggests that if you can get 18 right that would be rated as a 'Fair', 20 right 'Good' and 22 'Very good'.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The whole family can experience real-life hunting &ndash; rules, safety, decoys, waterfowl identities, fun, excitement, laughs! Great fun for a hunter, birdwatcher, or anyone interested in waterfowl because it involves 2-4 players in hunting strategy, bird identification, and safety practices used by good sportsmen. The object is to be the first player back to the Clubhouse with the &quot;bag limit&quot; of birds (at least 4 bird pictures with matching description cards).<br/><br/>Starting at the clubhouse, roll the dice and move that number of colored spaces. You may move either way on the board, and you may choose to take an inside path to reach the color space that you want. At each space you collect a card of the matching color: Green for a bird picture, orange for a bird description, or yellow for a situation card which explains a safety tip or legal point. When drawing a situation card, follow the instructions; it may send you to the Dog Training School, Sporting Goods Store, or Skeet Shooting Field! (The tan square has no matching deck, so no card is drawn.) When you have collected four different bird cards and their matching descriptions, hurry back to the Club House to claim your win!<br/><br/>Duck Hunter is packaged in a handsome, full-color box which contains the game board, instructions, four tokens, two dice and three card decks. One deck contains beautifully executed, full-color pictures of birds, the second deck has full descriptions of birds and their habitats and the third deck contains situation cards which remind players of proper hunting procedures, present comedic pitfalls, and provide penalties and bonuses.<br/><br/>The bird pictures are by internationally renowned wildlife artist Bob Hines. He was the only National Wildlife Artist to be employed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.<br/><br/>",

Treat three of the same number accordingly.<br/><br/>Crossing the finish line is a little different for this game. If a horse is one square from the finish, it can only move forward if only one die shows that number (so if two or three dice are that number, the horse cannot move.<br/><br/>I would think the game plays best with 2, 3 or 6 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The object of the game is to make the names of the states, building each name, syllable by syllable, beginning with the first syllable.  There are two decks of cards, one for the states east of the Mississippi River, and one for the states west.  The decks contain one card for each syllable in each state name (the card backs show a picture of the state). One deck is used in a game.<br/><br/>To start, one deck is split into six piles with the word side up.  The first player takes a card with the first syllable of a state.  Only one first syllable can be taken, and only four states can be started at a time.  A player may then take as many additional syllable cards that are available in the open piles for the states they are building, including from uncovered cards.<br/><br/>If a player cannot use any of the top cards or no first syllables are available, the player turns up a new set by putting each top card face down next to each pile.  If the player still cannot use any of these newly turned cards, play goes to the next player, who can then turn up a new set if necessary.  When all word side facing cards have been used, the next player may turn back over the covered card and use it if they can.<br/><br/>Completed states are set aside and a player can then start a new state, up to four.<br/><br/>When all states are built, the game is over and the largest number of states wins.  Alternatively, the largest number of cards may win.<br/><br/>An alternate rule set is included to use the picture side, building up to six states, by matching pictures.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is pure pre-WWII propaganda aimed at encouraging Germans to enlist in the military. It is a simple roll-and-move affair, with the objective of reaching the final square first while obeying special instructions for each of the illustrated spaces. The game instructions are printed on the underside of the box lid.<br/><br/>The board has two sides, each with a distinct game and message. The title side shows the wonderful experiences awaiting recruits to the army, navy and air forces: being taught how to make a bed properly by a kindly drill sergeant, learning how to gamble with cards, eating gourmet food from a field kitchen, meeting pretty ladies at a military dance, and engaging in a variety of sports, drama and musical activities. Along the way, recruits also learn how to shoot, how to march, how to swim a river in full kit, how to climb a mast and how to fly, before marching happily out the gate as their service comes to an end.<br/><br/>The second side of the board has a similar roll-and-move game that sends players on a grand tour of a newly expanded Germany. The map shows a Germany that includes Austria and the Sudetenland (with the former borders of Czechoslovakia still outlined), but does not yet extend into Poland. This clearly dates the game to late 1938 or early 1939.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Duck Pins is a bowling game that was created by J Pressman early in the 1900's. Duck pin bowling is a game that is played in the state of Rhode Island and is somewhat similar to the Candlepin Bowling that is done in the Northeast, especially Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Each frame consists of 3 balls and not just two. Unlike Candlepin bowling where the fallen pins stay on the lane as &quot;deadwood&quot; which can be used to help or hinder a second or third shot, in Duck Pins the pins are cleared from the lane before the next shot is taken. One can score a STRIKE, a SPARE or a TEN (3 balls to knock all the pins down!)<br/><br/>",

First, a circular board is laid out randomly using the treasure cards (containing treasures in the range from 1-6). Players take turns rolling a d6 and moving the pirate ship clockwise along the treasure cards. When the ship stops at a card, the player may take it if his die result is equal or higher compared to the treasure card. Alternatively, the player may place the conch on the treasure card and roll a second time, potentially getting a second treasure card (or none at all!). The player with the most treasure cards in the end wins the game.<br/><br/>The box contains 21 treasure cards, a wooden pirate ship, a small plastic conch and a die.<br/><br/>",

Mr. Weenaman was making a personal appearance, in costume, as part of the track's season opening festivities.  The Captain Weenie Show, which totally lost its school age audience years ago, had become the rage of the age 25 to 45 crowd.  While scratchy cartoons and local magicians provided the bulk of the show's content, the program took on grotesque proportions when Weenaman peddled his Captain Weenie VCR Covers and Weenamagic, a do-it-all food processor.<br/><br/>This is a role playing game for 6 players, great for a fun evening.  The suspect characters include three local T.V. news personalities, a female sulky driver, a state racing board official, and a track character named Paddock Pete.  Cast yourself and friends in these roles and play to learn who murdered this most unusual nostalgia act.<br/><br/>The Time: December 1, 1985   The Place: Galesburg, OH<br/><br/>Note: This game includes an audio cassette tape which, although not mandatory, is played at the start to set the mood.<br/><br/>",

If he/she is successful, he/she earns that card. Other cards are earned by being the fastest to grab the tin or the chit.

The frog that has had the tastiest meal (scored the most points) is the winner.<br/><br/>The movement/hopping mechanic in Leap Frog! uses a small deck of cards, containing distance values between 1 and 4. In order to hop to a lily pad, a player must play a card from his hand equal to the distance of the jump. Leap Frog uses a simple, yet novel, system to determine jumping distance, which takes into account both the number of spaces and the height a frog must jump.<br/><br/>",

Each player protects a single goal space from both opponents. In spite of the name, this game is a three-handed version of Cam, not Camelot in that the first first to enter a goal wins and so ends the game.

        "description": "The Hunt: Carpathia, 1897 is a period specific tabletop adventure game, set in the dangerous monster-ridden land of Carpathia.<br/><br/>Players of The Hunt will take turns moving around the game board, fighting monsters, avoiding hazards, collecting bounties, and trying to kill one another - all while trying to find better weapons and gear.  Ultimately they want to take down one of the unique Prey monsters, each of whom grants a unique ability to their vanquisher.<br/><br/>Weapons, items, monsters and hazards are all represented on detailed cards with unique art relevant (we hope) to the time period.  Players roll dice (d8) to move and attack, using their own special abilities and items to their best advantage.  Each player is one of 6 unique characters, each with different strengths.<br/><br/>Death in The Hunt is by no means final - when a player loses all vitality points (players start with and have a max of 3) he/she is turned into a &quot;cursed&quot; player, remains on the board with new abilities, and is now turned against the remaining live players.  Nobody is ever &quot;out of the hunt.&quot;<br/><br/>Players battle monsters and each other earning trophy points for each monster vanquished.  A player must collect a certain number of trophy points and make it back to the ship for the win!  If all players become cursed, the cursed player with the most trophy points wins.<br/><br/>",

Actions are resolved using Blackjack but the players play versus each other instead of a dealer. The players are gamblers who create electronic avatars to fight in a virtual arena. Players may use the included Fighters, or create a custom Fighter using a combination of Abilities and Gear. Players also have a Cheat which breaks the rules and an Exploit which gives your Fighter a huge short term boost. Momemtum Tokens are earned for successfully attacking and defending and can be used to increase a Fighter's Abilities.<br/><br/>Game Flow:<br/>Players may have their Fighter Run or Attack on their turn. If they Attack, the player may wager points  on the Attack, if the Attack hits, it deals additional damage based upon the size of the wager. If the Attack misses, the wager is lost. Attack damage is also modified by weapon type and a random damage element based upon margin of success.<br/><br/>When a Fighter runs out of points they die. A Buy In oppurtunity allows players to bring their Fighter back into the Arena. In the end the last Fighter standing in the Arena wins the match.<br/><br/>An additional copy of Battlejack may be used at the same to increase the number of players from 2-4 to 5-8.<br/><br/>",

These tournaments brought together knights from across the realm to fight for glory and honor.  &ldquo;Combat in the lists&rdquo; is a game of hand-to-hand combat that pits knight against knight in pitch battle.  These battles were never fought to the death and the weapons used were usually dull or blunted to render an opponent unconscious but sometimes deaths did occur.  It wasn&rsquo;t uncommon for a battle in the list to last for hours and end only when the last knight was left standing.  It was this lone knight that was honored as the tournament champion.<br/><br/>The goal of the tournament was to be the last knight standing inside the list!<br/><br/>Some of the objectives and actions within Combat in the lists:<br/><br/>1.  7 possible movement obtions<br/>2.

        "description": "Revolt and Revolution is the newest offering from our strategic partnership with Victory Point Games, and the first game we are producing from their immensely popular States of Siege series.  The idea for this and future volumes is to thematically take two existing titles from VPG's States of Siege line and add a third as-yet-unpublished game to the pack to create a GMT boxed set using larger counters, full sized cards, and mounted maps, all utilizing the talents of GMT's art and production team.<br/><br/>The States of Siege game system from Victory Point Games features solitaire play in which the player is thrust into the role of defending a central position from attackers advancing on a number of fronts using area movement.  Event cards provide the challenges and opportunities players use to fend off defeat while they battle for victory.  Each game in the series introduces new elements to the robust game engine and expands the possibilities of what can be simulated.  With each event card, players have a variety of actions possible but are limited by the number of action points on a given turn...in a States of Siege game there are just never enough points to get all the things done they would like.<br/><br/>Revolt and Revolution puts the player at the center of the epic clashes of ideology and culture in Europe through the 17th, 18th, 19th and 20th centuries.  You, the player, get to participate in the conflicts of Divine Right vs Parliamentarianism, Absolutism vs Republicanism, and Despotism vs Bolshevism. You'll rub (simulated) elbows around your game table with King Charles I and Cromwell, King Louis XVI and Robespierre, Czar Nicholas II and Lenin, and participate in historic conflicts as Cavaliers battle Roundheads, Monarchists battle Jacobins, and 'Whites' battle 'Reds' across the fields, towns and cities of England, France and Russia.  The outcome of these wars changed the face of Europe and the World forever.<br/><br/>The titles in Revolt and Revolution are dynamic -- your decisions affect the course of events in both the short and long term.  Unlike most historical games which enforce a linear outcome and constrain you to the path of history, in the States of Siege game system your decisions and strategies can alter the existing timeline.  Now you have a chance to take command and make history or change it!<br/><br/>The first game in the pack is by series creator Darin Leviloff.  Soviet Dawn: The Russian Civil War, 1918-1921: The Russian Civil War 1918 - 1921 puts you in the position of defending the Bolshevik Revolution from the array of 'White' forces bent on its destruction.  Can you deal with the great crises of that time and defend the revolution? Will you withdraw from the Great War (WWI) or exercise the Bukharin Option and fight on? Can you execute the Czar in time, or will the 'Whites' rescue him? Will you fortify Petrograd or press your offensives home? How will you deal with internal and external dissent?  These are just some of the challenges to meet as you decide the fate of Communism in the 20th century.  Revolt and Revolution will include both the base game Soviet Dawn and its expansion pack.<br/><br/>The second game in the tri-pack is from series developer John Welch.  Levee En Masse: The Wars of the French Revolution 1789 - 1802 puts you in the position of defending the Republican Revolution from forces both within and outside of France, during the tumultuous years of the French.  Can you suppress the forces of Monarchy and Despotism to maintain the Republican spirit in France? Can you export the revolution by liberating neighboring states and creating sister Republics? Will you be able to keep order in Paris as it suffers from riot after riot? Can you rally your armies to defeat those of rival European states like Britain, Prussia and Austria?  These are just a few of the obstacles you must overcome to end Monarchy and bring forth the era of Republican government that will transform Europe in the 19th century.  Revolt and Revolution will include both the base game Lev&eacute;e en Masse and its expansion pack.<br/><br/>The third game in Volume I is a never-before-published game in the States of Siege series!  John Welch's Cruel Necessity: The English Civil Wars 1640-1653:  The English Civil Wars 1640 - 1653 puts you in charge of Puritanism and Parliament and their attempts to usher in the Reformation and Age of Reason.  Can you create a fighting force capable of defeating the Royalist Armies of Charles I?  Can you foster Puritan religious reforms while suppressing those of your rival Protestants  and hated Catholics?  Can you forge an alliance with the Covenanters of Scotland and prevent them for going over to the King?  Can you manage the rebellions in Ireland without draining too many men and resources to do so?  These are just some of the dilemmas you must balance in order to bring an end to Divine Right Monarchy and usher in the Age of Revolution.  The GMT edition will include a grand tactical combat mini-game in addition to the base game of Cruel Necessity - after all, what fun would an English Civil War game be without the charge of cavalry and the push-of-pikes?<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>â Three 17&quot; x 22&quot; mounted maps<br/>â 88 Large Square counters<br/>â 56 Round counters<br/>â 180 Event cards (60 for each game)<br/>â Three 10-page Rules booklets (one for each game)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Four Horsemen... They&rsquo;ve always been here. Whenever humanity has stepped too close to the abyss, they&rsquo;ve come. Often taking the guise of whatever was causing the Apocalypse of that particular age. The Fall of Rome, the Black Plague, World War 2, they were here. Ready to help usher in the end of man. United in the goal, but never the means. Because of this, either by some sort of grand plan or merely by chance, a balance has formed, preserving the time of man again and again. The Horsemen&rsquo;s individual desires to be &quot;The One&quot; to snuff the candle of mankind&rsquo;s light actually thwarting the very event they hoped to cause. Then came the Zombie Apocalypse, and again they came. War, relishing the conflict and self destruction of humans- now even after death. Famine, bringing hunger and desperation to both the living and the undead. Pestilence, with pain and suffering that could last this time even after one&rsquo;s last breath was drawn. And finally Death, savoring the slow rot of a person&rsquo;s demise more than ever before. But this time they weren&rsquo;t alone. A Fifth Horseman has also come. One that could never exist before now. A Horseman born of music, technology, and the anger of a species on the brink. Will this new Horseman break the ages old balance that has existed and finally bring about the end of us all? Or is something else at play?<br/><br/>The Fifth Horseman is a 2 Player game where the aim is to bring about the end of man by defeating your fellow Horsemen and laying sole claim to the final Apocalypse. You accomplish this by landing various Strikes that lower your opponent&rsquo;s Life and Hand Size, as well as increasing your own. The Fifth Horseman uses 6 sided hex cards that allow each card the ability to use one of 6 different effects (Strikes). Victory is achieved when your opponent is depleted of Life points.<br/><br/>",

Two neighboring fragments only by the edges should not be considered contiguous.<br/><br/>A &quot;bad&quot; fragment is one that involves a road user committing a careless or a contravention of the rules of the road. These fragments are shaded and numbered on the image model.<br/><br/>Mix all the fragments of the game, then share them with partners.<br/><br/>The first player chooses a piece and places. If he has a fragment neighbor, he also raises, etc. Each fragment must be placed with the previous close.<br/><br/>The next player selected a fragment close to the last set by the previous player, and the pose. He can continue, if another fragment placed next to last, etc.<br/><br/>If there is in the game, a hole (empty space on all sides by fragments), or a slot (slot in the periphery of the image), it is possible to plug this hole or that niche instead of asking a neighbor of the last fragment. Every time a player mouth hole or a slot, he can play again and where he wants to continue to ask neighboring fragments.<br/><br/>A player can pass. If all players pass, the one whose turn to play may be a fragment anywhere near a fragment already made.<br/><br/>The winner is the first who got rid of all its fragments. The other players count how many they have left fragments. The &quot;bad&quot; fragments are worth 4 points unless the player may explain the mistake, In this case, it counts two points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game draws its inspiration from and aims to re-create the large scale space battles of Star Wars and Babylon 5. The premise for SPACE FLEET ALPHA is simple, to be the last man standing in a great big battle royale between a number of opposing starship fleets.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player elects to represent one of the six available factions, each of which has a unique technological advantage and disadvantage and then is dealt a number of cards face up. Players then take turns using their cards to attack and destroy their opponents' cards until all other players have been eliminated. Depending on players play styles, the gameplay can be brutally fast and efficient with fleets of ships disappearing in the blink of an eye or slow and tense as players nip at each other's heels.<br/><br/>Cards are roughly divided into ship cards, which are the most numerous and the main targets of your opponent's fleet, and bonus cards which perform a variety of special abilities ranging from defensive shields, technological bonuses, reinforcements, espionage cards and thermonuclear warheads. The first thing to realize when playing SPACE FLEET ALPHA is that the playing field is definitely not level and no two games will ever play out the same. The random nature of the deal ensures that one player will always start out on top however, fortunes can quickly change requiring players to adapt their strategy accordingly. In order to deal with this, the game actively encourages the weaker players to ally against stronger opponents as well as use any leverage they might have to blackmail other players into doing their bidding for them.<br/><br/>Of course these temporary situations only last for so long as there can be only one winner and its this aspect of the game that makes it so exciting to play. While SPACE FLEET ALPHA can be played with 2 players, the game really starts to shine with a group of 4 or more players. Independantly designed and published, SPACE FLEET ALPHA can be ordered direct from the website of the publisher The Game Crafter which prints, produces and ships the game on demand. Overall SPACE FLEET ALPHA is definitely worth a look for anyone into space battles and looking for something on the lighter side that can be played by anyone.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Published in S&amp;T in from Volume 1, issue 3, through Volume 2, issue 1.  The game materials content was a bit limited; you were given a list of the unit counters and a photograph of the map, which was a giant Stalingrad board with a few extra terrain features, especially in Finland.  The limited assertions in 2.1 appear to imply that the game was played using the rules for Stalingrad, though references in Stalingrad III to Divisional Stalingrad imply that you could also use the Stalingrad III rules.  Nonetheless, it really is a game, a bit under-presented like many other early games, such as Operation Gigantis (which eventually became Confrontation).<br/><br/>The theme is the German invasion of Russia in World War 2. The goals and game play could be identical (except for the new map and new list of counters) with either AH Stalingrad or Poultron Press Stalingrad III, depending on the optional rules choice made by the players, because the optional rules choice was to use one rules book or the other rules book.<br/><br/>If the game was played using the Stalingrad rules, the core rules were:<br/><br/>Stalingrad uses a move-combat sequence, alternating between players.  There is limited advance  (one square) or retreat (two squares) after combat.  Units have one-square thick zones of control; movement directly from one square in the zone of control of a unit into an adjoining square of the zone of control of the same unit is not allowed.  Functional terrain includes swamp (one square per turn movement), mountains (one square per turn movement, defenders are doubled), major cities (defenders doubled), rivers (defenders behind rivers are doubled if attacked only across the river), railroads (ten square movement bonus, must be taken all at once), lakes (impassible).  Weather is good in summer, snow in winter, and governed by a table in the spring and fall.  Mud halves ground movement.  Snow halves ground and rail movement, and freezes (converts to clear terrain) some swamps, rivers, lakes, and oceans.  Combat is mandatory between units that are adjacent at the end of each turn, but the attacker chooses which units attack which other units, so long as all adjacent units are in some battle.  The classical Avalon Hill D6 table, with results such as D Elim, A Elim, etc is in use.  Germans have limited replacements; Russian replacement rates escalate as the game goes on.  The objective is to capture the opposition's key cities (for the Russians, Leningrad, Moscow, Stalingrad) or to destroy the other side's army.  The Russian (implicit in rules) can also win by taking Helsinki, Warsaw, and Bucharest, and holding them for two complete turns.<br/><br/>Stalingrad was the first board war game with the modern placement of rivers down the middle of hexagons, rather than the old-fashioned placement of rivers on hex edges, as also seen in Stlingrad II.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The elderly wizard Zeljin zipped and zapped around the woods collecting ingredients for his dinner. Looking forward to his world-famous toadstool and cactus burgers, he returned at sunset to his treehouse hidden atop an ancient sturdysprout tree on the edge of Gnarlwood Forest. Removing his cloak, he discovered a hole in his bag of Magic Jelly Beans. Oh, no! they must be scattered all over the forest floor. Even worse, these were Moon Beans, which can only be seen by the light of the moon. Dangerous creatures come out at night in those woods and the old wizard can&rsquo;t see in the dark. He needs you and your friends to find them and bring them back. He has promised a reward of fun treats and magic spells made with the mashed magic beans, but only if you can bring them back in the right combinations.<br/><br/>Players attempt to find matching pairs of jelly beans from a pool of face down tokens and collect amusement (victory) points.<br/><br/>When a player discovers unmatched pairs, he or she can collect recipe cards for amusement points instead. Players must also watch out for monsters hiding among the jelly bean tokens, waiting to steal their jellybeans.<br/><br/>This is a family fun game of matching and memory with a drop of strategy to help kids develop these lines of thinking and to keep the parents engaged as well.<br/><br/>",

Where would you hole-up to protect you and your loved ones from the hungry dead?  Could you survive with the people that you call your friends or would you be forced to leave them on the side of the road?<br/><br/>Welcome to Deadworld.<br/><br/>In Deadworld, you and your friends play yourselves by choosing the trait cards that best fit your true personas; this is done at the start of the game.  After everyone makes their &quot;game-self&quot;, players take turns searching the ruins of civilization for supplies, fighting off the growing legions of undead, building defenses and improvements to their home base, and doing their best to live with those they considered their peers before the world fell into chaos.<br/><br/>Be careful: the allure of anarchy and unbridled wickedness is powerful in Deadworld.  You and your friends may choose to follow the path of good or you all may quickly descend along the road to evil.  It's your choice.  But that choice will affect how you interact with events and other survivors.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the goal of Deadworld is to survive.  If all players can make it to the end of the chosen scenario, then the player with the highest survival points is the winner.<br/><br/>Can you survive a Deadworld?<br/><br/>",

Players can also Borrow words previously played to create another word by Adding, Subtracting, Replacing, or Rearranging the tiles and so earn more tokens.<br/>The game ends when there are no more tiles in the bag and one of the players uses up all their tiles. The winner is the one with the highest value of tokens.<br/>Sentence Play requires words played in a meaningful sentence.<br/>Theme Play requires the words are used in a sentence in the context of a chosen theme (e.g., environment, fairy tales, countries, etc)<br/>Can be played competitively or cooperatively.<br/><br/>",

Roll the dice and move your plane from the airfield or along the flight path, if you land on another plane they go back to the nearest empty space. Rolling a six allows you to bring a plane from your terminal to the airfield and gives you another go. When one of your planes reaches 32,000ft (this does not have to be an exact throw) you remove it to your '32' spaces next to your terminal. The first to get all four planes to 32,000ft is the winner.<br/><br/>Land<br/>Play works as above, but you start at 32,000ft and work your way down to the airfield, landing has to be an exact throw or you overshoot the runway.<br/><br/>Take Off &amp; Land<br/>Choose which players are going to 'Take Off' and which players are going to 'Land' and place planes accordingly. Enter the flight path either way by the amount you throw with the dice. If you settle into airspace that is occupied by another player then your opponents plane must leave the flight path altogether and return to its starting position.<br/>Roll a six to get another plane on the flight path, after rolling a six place the plane six airspaces in. You do not need to throw the exact number when finishing. Then put your plane either at 23,000ft or in your terminal and airfield depending on whether you were Taking Off or Landing. The first person to successfully complete their flight with all their aircraft is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Special cake is a two players game playable with the Shibumi game system. It uses the 4&times;4 holes board and 30 balls of the set. The game consists of three variants, created together, at the same time: &quot;mint and liquorice candies&quot;, &quot;sugar candies&quot; and &quot;mint, liquorice and cherry candies (aka the poisoned candy)&quot;.<br/><br/>Mint and liquorice candies<br/>In the &ldquo;mint and liquorice candies&rdquo; variant the balls are 15 white (mint candies) and 15 black (liquorice candies).<br/>Rules<br/>Set up: a player places a mint candy and the other a liquorice candy until the pyramid (the cake) is complete. The candies can be placed either on empty board holes or stacking on 2x2 platforms of existing candies.<br/>Game: the game starts when the cake is complete. Players take turns eating (removing) a candy, either mint or liquorice, or a line of mint and liquorice candies. The candies forming the line can be removed, one-by-one, in any desired order. <br/>A line is a straight group (in 3D) of at least two tastes touching candies, either orthogonally if they are in the same level or one on top of the other if they are in different levels. The lines don't wrap around corners or edges (since in this case they are not really straight when you consider the 3D space).<br/>The player who eats the last candy loses the game.<br/><br/>Sugar candies<br/>The &ldquo;sugar candies&rdquo; variant of the game uses 30 balls, randomly selected among the whole Shibumi set of 16 white balls, 16 black balls and 16 red balls.<br/>Rules<br/>The game starts with all the 30 candies placed to form the complete square pyramid (the cake). Players take turns eating (removing) a candy or a line of touching candies. The candies forming the line can be removed, one-by-one, in any desired order.<br/>A line is a straight group (in 3D) of at least two touching candies, either orthogonally if they are in the same level or one on top of the other if they are in different levels. The lines don't wrap around corners or edges (since in this case they are not really straight when you consider the 3D space).<br/>The player who eats the last candy loses the game.<br/><br/>Mint, liquorice and cherry candies (aka the poisoned candy)<br/>In the mint, liquorice and cherry candies variant of the game the balls are 15 white (mint candies), 14 black (liquorice candies) and one red ball (cherry candy).<br/>Rules<br/>Set up: a player places a mint candy and the other a liquorice candy till the 29th candy, then the cherry candy is placed on the top of the pyramid (the cake). The candies can be placed either on empty board holes or stacking on 2x2 platforms of existing candies.<br/>Game: the game starts when the cake is complete. Players take turns eating (removing) a candy, either mint or liquorice, or a line of mint and liquorice candies. The candies forming the line can be removed, one-by-one, in any desired order. <br/>A line is a straight group (in 3D) of at least two tastes touching candies, either orthogonally if they are in the same level or one on top of the other if they are in different levels. The lines don't wrap around corners or edges (since in this case they are not really straight when you consider the 3D space).<br/>The player who eats the cherry candy loses the game (and, if it is poisoned, the life, too!).<br/><br/>Notes<br/>According to the Shibumi drop mechanism, when a ball is removed, then any others that it supports will drop. Any ball that directly supports two or more on the level above is pinned and cannot be removed. <br/>Due to the drop mechanism and to the possibility to remove a straight group of balls, one-by-one, a ball of the line that you want to remove, pinned at the beginning of the move, can become unpinned during the move after the removal of another ball of the group, thus allowing its removing. The players are not forced to remove full lines, i.e. the longest lines in that direction.<br/><br/>Online play<br/><br/>Special cake can be played online (real time) at igGameCenter - <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/sandboxshibumi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/sandboxshibumi.html</a><br/><br/>",

It requires one game master and one book keeper on deck at all times. A minimum of three of each is recommended for anyone attempting to set up a session. I've listed 8 players as a minimum, but that would probably be pretty sparse. 30-50 is probably recommended. any more than that, and you will probably have people waiting in line to play for most of the peak hours.<br/><br/>Players set up corporations made up of up to three players. Each corporation collects and trades resources, makes bets on the stock market and can battle other players. The goal is to be the corporation with the highest score at the end of the game session. There are also individual goals (called Legend Trials) and many other accolades for achievements throughout the game, such as being the first to build a star base.<br/><br/>The game is divided into four phases with slightly different rules and prerequisites. Each card in the game has four different functions: as ship part, as cybernetic upgrade, natural resource and combat maneuver. How to collect and transform cards is one of the main mechanics of the game, the second is the card-vs-card combat system and the last the financial betting system.<br/><br/>",

It uses the 4&times;4 holes board and balls of all three colors.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>The board starts empty. Two players, white and black, take turns placing a ball of their color, or a red ball, on an empty board hole.<br/>When any 2x2 platform is created, the ball that has to be placed on the platform must be of the predominant color, or, if there is not a predominant color, the ball must be of the absent color. Established the color to place on the top, if it is red or the color of the current player, he has to place the ball on the platform in the same turn, instead if it is the color of the other player, next turn the other player has a forced move and must place that ball. Completing a platform forces the completion of other platforms.<br/>The player who places a ball of his color on the top of the pyramid wins the game, but if he must place on the apex a red ball he loses.<br/><br/>Note<br/>As for the forced move in the next turn, there are more than 16 moves, but all the levels above the first one are decided by the 16 balls on the 4x4 board. The placing of the red ball on the apex is a losing condition and a player can use the sequence of forced moves to force the other to be the player who places the red ball on the top of the pyramid.<br/><br/>Online play<br/><br/>Sphered can be played online (real time) at igGameCenter - <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/sandboxshibumi.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/sandboxshibumi.html</a><br/><br/>",

The game differs from others in the genre in that where a player plays his cards is important, there is a larger level of player interaction and that a player can grow or shrink his deck's size easily. Players start with 12 card decks but have the flexibility to lower the deck size to 0 cards or raise it as high as 20 or more cards. Players try to obtain the most victory points to win.<br/><br/>Set in mythical Greece, each player takes the role of a city ruler that must try to appease Zeus and his siblings. Each player utilizes followers and recruited heroes, each which have special powers.<br/><br/>Each player starts with the same deck of cards. Players choose to play their cards to wage war, recruit allies, sacrifice, go on legendary quests, increase their worship and battle powerful heralds of the gods.<br/><br/>The design incorporates ideas from several games including Dominion, Twilight Struggle and 7 Wonders.<br/><br/>",

Sneak past them to bring home fresh veggies for a delicious treat!<br/><br/>On your turn, roll the 3 colored dice and resolve them in order:<br/><br/>- Blue Die:  Shows which section of the garden Pickles the Farmer will visit this turn.  Any rabbits in that section lose the Veggie Tile they're carrying, and must go to the farmhouse until their next turn.<br/> - Orange Die:  Shows how many spaces Digger the Dog will move around the dog run on his turn.  If the dog enters a forest where a Rabbit Pawn is waiting, that rabbit drops their veggies and must return to their rabbit hole until their next turn.<br/> - White Die:  Move your Rabbit Pawn up to the number of spaces you rolled.  You may stop to pick up a Veggie Tile then continue on until the number of spaces you rolled are used up.  But remember...sometimes it's safer to move fewer spaces than you rolled.<br/><br/>Collect veggies (carrots, radishes, lettuce, or eggplants) for points -- if they're from another rabbit's corner of the garden you earn bonus points!<br/><br/>WHAT THEY'LL LEARN:  Sequencing, Risk vs Reward, Early Counting &amp; Math<br/><br/>",

On a player's turn, their car pawn can move three times using the roads or airlines.  Events or Bonus Cards may give additional moves.  Announce the names of each city you visit, so other players are aware which cities have been visited.<br/><br/>Each time a player stops in a city shown on a &quot;public card&quot; or one of their Destination Cards, they add that card face-up in their scoring area and move up the scoring track.<br/><br/>Always pay attention during other players' turns.  If another player visits a city that matches one of the cards in your hand, ask them to send you a postcard!  They score the card you were holding, but you receive a card from the Postcard Deck, which is also worth a point.<br/><br/>After finishing your turn, draw cards from the Destination Deck to replenish your hand back to 3 cards.  If an Event Card is revealed while drawing, follow the instructions on the card first, then draw a new Destination Card to replace it.<br/><br/>Any time a player completes a set of 3 Destination Cards and/or Postcards of the same color, they receive a Bonus Card.

One die per battery.  If a hit is scored, another die is rolled to determine the damage.

Within certain restrictions these dice may be allocated to more than one enemy flight per turn as required.<br/><br/>Radar can be useful to detect enemy forces. Once forces come within visual range, firing is likely to commence.  Damage rates may seem high. It is quite possible for a destroyer to be sunk in a single round of combat. Ships suffer damage which includes degradation of firepower, speed, or C3 systems.<br/><br/>C3 systems and formation command are simulated with each formation's flagship maneuvering and any ships in formation with it will conform.

Each of the advertisers received complete decks in maroon colored boxes with gold lettering that featured the company name.<br/><br/>Each player tries to collect sets of the same numbered card. They ask for cards from other players (which must be handed over) but if you are unsuccessful in your search then you end your turn by drawing a card.

Eventually, all sets will be collected and the player with the most sets, wins.<br/><br/>Each card is an advertisement for products at the time.

The snakes are scored once there are two ends, and the player with the majority of the pieces in that chain scores the points.<br/><br/>The board has 10 snakes on it, and each snake's eye holds a special token (hole, twist, cross). These are randomly chosen and placed by all players when starting the game. A hole is impassable, but a twist allows a player to twist any snake piece on the board. This can change things considerably! The cross is an intersection that ends all snakes that touch it.<br/><br/>Twisted Tails was created by Kevin Kulp and J. Tagmire at the 2012 Global Game Jam.

        "description": "At last, there's a fun new way to avoid the dreaded &quot;awkward silence&quot; when dating someone new! Introducing ACQUAINT&trade; - the revolutionary &quot;real deal&quot; card game that helps first-, second-, or even third-time daters get better acquainted. It was designed not only to create conversation and calm nerves, but to also help daters better determine each other's &quot;keeper&quot; potentials; needless to say, finding out early on whether or not they are truly compatible may prove to be a time-saving, preventative measure of future heartache.<br/><br/>This highly interactive card game includes questions, tasks, lessons and more! It encourages 'authentic' conversation through the sharing of thoughts, experiences, feelings and values. Questions range from light-hearted topics to semi-personal and serious, and fun &quot;off-the-wall&quot; topics are included throughout.<br/><br/>OBJECT: Collect as many Rose Cards in your hand as you can by discarding as many other cards as possible. Players perform any task(s) listed on the discarded card on each turn. There are a total of 9 Rose Cards, and the player with the most in their hand at the end wins. The main point of the game, however, is for the players to get to know one another better.<br/><br/>CARDS: Includes 52 cards total <br/><br/>     9 ROSE CARDS<br/>     20 'REAL DEAL' QUESTION CARDS <br/>     4 FILL-IN-THE-BLANK CARDS<br/>     6 DISCUSSION CARDS<br/>     5 SCALE (&quot;What # Are You?&quot;) CARDS<br/>     6 MISCELLANEOUS CARDS ('Listening Check' Card, 'Deception Destroyer' Card 'Share' Card, 'Flirt' Card, 'Deal Breaker' Card, &amp; 'Compromise' Card) <br/>     2 PROTECTION CARDS<br/><br/><br/>START: SHUFFLE CARDS WELL before starting (keeping all the cards facing the same direction). Choose which player will go first. Players must also choose in advance the level of play preferred for the 'REAL DEAL' Questions from the three levels listed below.<br/><br/>REAL DEAL QUESTION CARD LEVELS: <br/><br/>     LEVEL 1 ('a' questions) - Simple, light-hearted questions to learn a little about your date - questions that are generally easy to answer and don't take that much thought<br/>     LEVEL 2 ('b' questions) - Moderate get-to-know-your-date questions - questions that get a little more serious, where people can reveal a bit more about themselves<br/>     LEVEL 3 ('c' questions) - Deep questions designed to create a bonding emotional connection, or, to better spot potential 'RED FLAGS' in advance--ideal for 'bold' daters. Keep in mind DISHONESTY CAN DESTROY EVEN THE BEST OF RELATIONSHIPS! PLAY AT YOUR OWN RISK! Warning: Some questions may be considered to some as personally inappropriate for a new date, even though the questions are in good taste. (The reason someone may pass on a question need not be explained -- besides, a little mystery can often prove to be an effective strategy as well.)<br/><br/><br/>PLAY: Each person is dealt 7 cards (one at a time) face down. The remaining cards are placed face down in a pile in the center of the table, forming the draw pile (or the Selection Pile). The first player (aka THE DISCARDER) takes a turn by drawing the top card from the Selection Pile followed by choosing a card to discard from his/her hand, reading it out loud first. Players then respond to any directions from the card accordingly. When finished, the DISCARDER places the card face up right alongside the Selection Pile, into what will be the Discard Pile (unless otherwise directed). Similarly, the other player then takes their turn, and so on.<br/><br/>SCORING: The game ends as soon as soon as the last card is picked up/discarded. The players then count the number of Rose Cards in their hands, and the player with the most roses wins. (If both players end up without any roses, it's considered a tie game.).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The &quot;It's all about grAtitude!&quot; project began with an idea several years ago to teach, in a fun and entertaining way, age-old universal principles of prosperity and abundance that have been taught in every major spiritual and cultural tradition. Those principles are known today by names such as Law of Attraction, Law of Allowing, Law of Gratitude, etc.<br/><br/>The idea, conceived by Theuns Serfontein in South Africa, was to use a board and card game (played much like a cross between Monopoly and Trivial Pursuit) to teach and promote these principles.  In 2010 the Law of Attraction worked to put Theuns together with Steve Vernon (a graphic and web designer in the United States) through an online marketing company in which they both were involved and, thanks to Skype, they became not only business partners, but very close friends.  A few months later, Theuns asked Steve to partner with him in his dream of creating &quot;grAtitude!&quot;- the game (originally called &quot;Bridge to Success&quot;).<br/><br/>The grAtitude! board game is played by tossing dice, moving around the &quot;G&quot;-shaped track, drawing cards from any of the four decks (depending on what space you land on), and following the instructions on the card within a certain time frame. You may, for example, have 30 seconds to name as many things as possible that start with the letter &quot;D&quot; that you're grateful for and win 1000 grati for each thing you name, or you might be told the Universe just rewarded you with 5,000 grati because you wrote down three daily goals this morning, or you might be asked to complete a famous quote or answer a multiple choice question.  With over 700 cards in the game, the possibilities are almost endless!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A development of the philosophy that started with BoF I, it features an all new game engine based on real world theories and training doctrines proven in combat.<br/><br/>Elegant in design, the rules allow you to focus on commanding the men, leading the action, and coming to grips with the chaos and uncertainty of combat.<br/><br/>Baptism of Fire III has been designed with ease of play in mind allowing players to concentrate on decisions and action.<br/><br/>Baptism of Fire III represents an evolution of modern skirmish game thought.  Imperfect information, uncertainties of command and a fluid, action driven activation sequence make for a hot and exciting table top game unlike any other.<br/><br/>Baptism of Fire III is our most unique and intense game to model skirmishes in WW2 and beyond.  The focus is on Leadership, training and morale using a game engine like no other game.  With pace and simultaneous interaction within a turn, players will find themselves engrossed in the unfolding action.<br/><br/>The unique game engine is the key to all this.  Evolved from earlier TFP Games rules, the system uses a non-traditional card draw, the player with the initiative deciding from 2 to 5 cards, creating a pace of play and simultaneous resolution of both sides activations.<br/><br/>The rules also use a sliding dice scale to reflect relative difficulty to resolve tasks or functions.  No adding modifiers to create impossibilities of failure or success.  BoF3 instead changes the size of the die rolling against fixed numbers, a simpler and faster system.<br/><br/>Leaders form the centre of attention.  They allow troops a greater degree of flexibility, and better Leaders will be able to motivate and lead their men more effectively.  They do this through Command Points.  Points may be spent to coax and motivate, direct actions more effectively, increase die sizes and more.  Leaders with reserved Command Points may also be reactivated within the same turn, pushing the men hard as they read or anticipate the tactical situation better than inferior leaders.<br/><br/>Supplements allow you to play post-WW2 conflicts.<br/><br/>",

It takes the elements of Cosmic Encounter that make it so fantastic (negotiating, backstabbing, variable alien powers, alliances) and tries to deliver it in a half hour playing time, and with far less components than the original.<br/><br/>The game replaces Encounter Cards with Encounter Dice, of which a player only has one at any given time. When having an Encounter, players can choose to Fight (hold the die in their fist) or Negotiate (keep their fist empty). The classic Prisoner's Dilemma outcomes apply, with mutually fighting players rolling their dice to determine a winner.<br/><br/>The game is completely free to print and play, and uses no artwork from Fantasy Flight Games. It is designed as a tribute to on of my favourite games of all time and as a thank-you to the BGG community, who has given me so much enjoyment and help in the last year.<br/><br/>",

In this simultaneous action selection game, out think your opponents by choosing the best strategy.  Each turn, you get to choose two actions in secret and then they are resolved in player order. You can move, gather pine cones, throw pine cones, or rest to recover damage.<br/><br/>Do you rush for the flag, or gather an armful of pine cones before you advance?  Do you attack from a safe distance or close in for the knockout blow?  There is no player elimination, but any player taking too much damage misses turns until he's rested enough to return to the game.<br/><br/>",

The mechanics are simple enough that you can teach most anyone to play, though strategic players are much more likely to win.<br/><br/>Each player is attempting to place agents into the newly forming USA. The more states your faction controls during the four major turning points in 19th century US history, the more conspiracy cards you will draw.

Will you answer?<br/><br/>You're a vigilante hero, one of the few in Crime City who have come together to put an end to the reign of terror the city's been trapped under. Banding together, you'll fight through a swath of henchmen in order to find and defeat one or more Arch Villains.

The cowboys start the game in the end of a canyon near their home town just after being caught in a flash flood on their way back from a cattle drive. Throughout the canyon they see materials scattered all over and someone remembers the payroll was on the chuck-wagon and probably in one of those piles of rubble. Suddenly the players begin to eye each other suspiciously as each decides they want all the gold for themselves. To make matters worse some of the other members of the cattle drive, the ones that didn't survive are getting up and moving towards the cowboys with a hungry look in their eyes. Most of the cowboys are armed with a six gun, but these zombies are endless and their ammo isn't. Now the cowboys must work together against the army of undead in order to survive, but in the back of each cowboy's mind is the payroll, and the chance that one of their fellow cowboys will turn on them.<br/><br/>The main objective of the game is to escape the canyon alive. However if multiple players escape the canyon then the player with the most gold is declared the winner. For a single player game the player must search all twenty boxes and escape the canyon alive.<br/><br/>Ages: 8+ <br/>Games will last approximately a half hour to an hour.<br/><br/>",

They spent the day together nibbling on plants and sharing stories.  The gopher was curious about the mountains the moose talked about and he wanted to go there.  The moose said it was too dangerous.  The gopher asked why the moose was not afraid.  The moose replied that he had antlers to protect him.<br/><br/>That night the gopher dreamed about seeing the mountains. He even dreamed he grew a set of antlers. When he woke up he had an idea.  He took the antlers from a plastic deer and taped them to his head.  His friend the moose saw him and said &quot;You are the size of a gopher but have antlers like a moose.  You must be a Moopher!&quot;  Together they traveled to the mountains.  One day Moopher met a trout.  The trout told Moopher that all rivers run to the sea.  When Moopher heard about the sea, he said good-bye to his friends and set off on his amazing journey.<br/><br/>Each player starts on a leaf that marks the headwaters of a river.  There are three ways to help Moopher move.  Each space on the board is numbered.  To move ahead one space, the player must roll the exact number needed on three dice.  If one die is the exact number needed, or any of the dice can be added to get the right number, the player moves.  The player can also choose to play a memory game with cards or answer a river question.  The first player to move their token into Hudson Bay is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fist Fight Club &ndash; The Dice Game (FFC) is a custom dice game for some fast and furious fist fight action with your mates.<br/><br/>Designed to be a fast play game, FFC is perfect for filling those times when other games are just too long (you know, like when your at your games club and have ten minutes to kill with your mates, or when you're waiting for a train).<br/><br/>How does it play? Well, here is the abridged version for two player games:<br/><br/>Players have 6 custom dice each, these dice have attack and defence icons on. They roll the dice to build up a 'fighting hand' with which to fight each other. Of the 6 dice, 3 are on show to all, three are kept secret.<br/><br/>The attacking players attack by playing one of their dice that shows an attack value. The defending player must play a die that shows the correct defense value to counter the attack value played on them. The attacker then plays a die with an attack value that counters the defense die just played by the defender.<br/><br/>This continues until one player is unable to play a die. If the defender can't play a die, they take a point of damage.<br/><br/>For games of more than 2 players, the actions gets even more intense as players attack who they want with the winner being the player with the least amount of damage taken when the first player to take all their damage is knocked out. So, attacking the player with the most damage isn't always the best tactic!<br/><br/>Capable of filling just as little as 5 minutes for two players but capable of being a big as you want. The more players you add, the more fun it is.<br/><br/>Being compact, it's easy to always having FFC with you. This means you and your mates never end up sitting around with nothing to do at your local club/store as you wait for your opponents to turn up. Just get out your dice and throw down with some mates for some real &lsquo;underground fight club&rsquo; action as a warm up for your main event!<br/><br/>",

This allows power and affects on each player's ability to gather votes. Money means a lot in the game, but is certainly not the decisive element. It's about playing the game tactically and be part of an alliance at the right time. The player can sit on power at one moment and sit with almost nothing the next minute. It is therefore important to constantly be alert and keep up with what opponents are doing. 2-6 participants. From approx. 9 years. Younger children may have practical roles.

You are fighting for power and glory, but more than that you are fighting for control of the world of Ra'al.<br/><br/>A game of BATTLEMAGE is fought between two warbands, each led by a powerful spellcaster called a Battlemage. The game is played on a tabletop with miniature figurines.<br/><br/>The game uses six-sided dice to resolve the conflict. Each figure (or 'warrior' as the game calls them) has it's own set of statistics that define how good it is at fighting: MV (move), ATT (attack), DEF (defence) and W (wounds). Additionaly, they may have special rules that let them do unusual things, such as make ranged attacks, use powers, or fly through the air, to name but a few.<br/><br/>The book contains five different warbands, each led by a different Battlemage. They include the Whiterock Loyalists, the Shadow Academy, the Cult of the Black Wind, The Horde of Seven Peaks and the Ghostwood Raiders.<br/><br/>Campaign rules are also include with the game, so that your warriors can improve with each battle.<br/><br/>",

In game you will: obtain precious treasures, hold prisoners captive, blast your opponents with cannons, and board enemy ships to steal their booty!<br/><br/>C&amp;C uses a unique cannon combat mechanic where players must find or trade for gunpowder and ammunition in order to fire their cannons.  Players can use cannonballs to sink enemy ships, chain-shot to make players lose turns (to repair their masts!), or grapeshot to clear the opponent's deck of crew.<br/><br/>Crew are used for boarding enemy ships to steal their cargo.  Crew can be equipped with pistols, muskets, rapiers, or cutlasses in order to increase their chance of success.  If victorious, crew are able to steal cards from the opposing player, whether that be supplies or gold.   Treasure cards will trade hands multiple times before the next Port! card is found where the players can take a breather before the next round of raids and cannon bombardments begin.<br/><br/>This is a dice and card game that relies heavily on luck.  In this sense, its best suited for casual gamers who are looking for a medium length game (30-60 minutes) that has excitement in every turn.<br/><br/>The game includes rules, two D6 dice, and 136 poker-size cards.<br/><br/>",

The deck consists of 2 sets of cards, letter cards and celestial point value cards. The letter cards consist of all 24 letters of the Greek alphabet from Alpha to Omega. Each letter card displays the name, uppercase &amp; lowercase Greek letter, along with English equivalents and variants. The letter cards are played in a diamond arrangement to create words. The celestial point value cards consist of 28 objects of the cosmos from our local solar system to the constellations of the zodiac along with wild cards of the cosmos. For each word formed, a player acquires a celestial point value card from the draw pile. The object of the game is to aquire as many celestial point value cards as possible. However, after all the letter cards have been played, the player who has acquired the sun card during regular play has a final opportunity to score additional points during the bonus round by forming a grammatically correct sentence from the words formed during regular play. The player with the highest point value wins. <br/>Age Range: 8 and up<br/><br/>",

Players can win a trip with a private jet to South America, ride a bike, train, taxi or stay for a visit at the North Pole. Everybody is active the whole time and anything can happen.<br/><br/>The player who is the first one to get six continent cards (one for each continent) wins the game. Players roll two dice and move accordingly on the map. They can use the Forward/Not cards to add/subtract from their rolls. Luck/Bad luck cards are as the name implies good or bad for the one who draws them. Continent cards are the object of the game, players have to roll a die and depending on the number, perform some action to win that card.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>This an unusual take on the usual Monopoly theme. In Greekopoly the object of the game is for the players to travel around the board collecting colonies (fraternities &amp; sororities), build on these, and force other players to go broke. (Players have to pay dues when landing on other player's properties.) When only one solvent player is left, that player is the Winner.<br/><br/>There are several interesting wrinkles in this title. Unlike in Monopoly where the properties for a neighborhood are within a few spaces of each other, Greekopoly Triads (a combination of 2 fraternities &amp; 1 sorority of the same color) are distributed on different sides of the board. In order to start building on these properties all the properties of a Triad must be owned by the same player. There are also Independent Colonies. Players may build on these without owning other properties, but only when they land on them. (This is in contrast to a Triad which may be built on at the rate of one building or upgrade per turn.) Other properties, simply referred to as Independents (like Greek Sportswear, Campus Pub, etc.) can be bought, but may not be built on.<br/><br/>The game's IFC cards and TGIF cards fulfill the roll that Community Chest &amp; Chance have in classic Monopoly. They introduce the role of chance (with positive and negative outcomes) with the draw of a card. There are also some special spaces on the board, some positive, and some negative&hellip; like the Dean's Office, where a player may be stuck so long he has to forfeit one of his Colonies.<br/><br/>This title was clearly meant to capitalize on the enduring popularity of the 1978 film National Lampoon's Animal House&quot; while skirting the need to pay licensing fees. Even the cover art, which also appears on the game board, strongly resembles the style and the content of the poster for Animal House's theatrical release. <br/><br/>",

        "description": "Board Game based on Athletic Disciplines<br/><br/>You will enjoy a real board game where athletic events are simulated on a track and field. Such as 100/200/400 metres, 110 metres hurdles, 4x100 metres, long, high and triple jump, and throwing events including: javelin, hammer discus and shot put.<br/>The goal is to achieve the highest score in the different athletic disciplines that are considered before the event.<br/><br/>The board represents the field and running track. On the track disciplines are developed throws and jumps, and on the track racing. The players will use 2/5 dice of different colors, depending on how many of the same discipline to develop. Difficulties in the disciplines are taken into account with one of the dice to use. In each discipline each player (athlete) will move its piece on the board in the room or location that corresponds to the number thrown with the dice and thereby indicate the regulations in each discipline.<br/><br/>The player who collected the most points at the end of the disciplines developed will be the winner of the competition.<br/><br/>",

If answering correctly, the site card can be discarded and a new travel chip is drawn. When reaching an unmarked site, they can earn a new site card (if that belongs to someone else, it can be &quot;stolen&quot;).<br/>When a player can reach both sites they drew at the beginning and gain two more site cards and return to their starting location, s/he wins the game.<br/><br/>Questions come in two difficulty levels, as the game is designed for language learning.

We include too, some 4th rates two deckers vessels, that, in some cases were used to execute and support frigate duties despite they were slow and cumbersome an many of them out-dated.<br/><br/>All this operations and engagements are covered by our rules Master &amp; Commander Frigates. We have included  48 British, 48 Spanish, 48 French, 48 US, 40 Dutch &amp; 24 Danish ships, including Two deckers, Frigates, Ras&eacute;es, Sloops of War, Brigs of War, Schooners, &amp; Cutters. The years covered with the ships are from the American War of Independence, French Revolutionary Wars, Napoleonic Wars, &amp; 1812 War.<br/><br/>To play Frigates you need the Master &amp; Commander Rules, Turning Templates, and Sailing Tables from Capitan Games.  Along with these you will need the optional rule for Beating.  All of these can be downloaded in pdf format (A4 paper size) from the Capitan Games website.<br/><br/>",

There are twelve 12s, eleven 11s, and so forth, with a single card ranked 1. The lower the number, the better the rank.<br/><br/>Before starting, each player draws a card to determine their position.  Lowest number is the King/Queen, up to the highest number being the Junior Townsperson.  The Wild card counts as 13 for this.<br/><br/>The deck is dealt out to all players and the object is to get rid of your cards as fast as possible. The hand begins with one person playing one or more card to the center of the table. The cards played must all be of the same rank (Wild cards may be played with any other cards). Each player in turn must now either play the same number of cards of a better rank, or pass. Play continues around the table until everyone has passed; at that point, the cards are cleared and whoever played the last set of cards leads the next round. After everyone has gone out, the players are ranked. For example, the person who first got rid of all his cards becomes the new King/Queen. At the end of each round, points are tallied based on the new position.  King/Queen is 5, Prince/Princess (second) is 3, Duke/Duchess (third) is 2 and all others are Junior Townspeople are 1 point. Players then change seat position to represent the new hierarchy and begin another round. Highest score at the end of 5 rounds wins.<br/><br/>Gameplay is like The Great Dalmuti, except that game has a finite end after 5 rounds, and maximum players are 6 instead of 8.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PiramiKa is a board game based chips in ancient Egyptian gods and culture.<br/><br/>At some point in the history of gaming chips Egyptians took shape and was born chess.<br/><br/>This game is an attempt to return the chips to a board where the chips are the Egyptian gods that depending on the nature of each god endow them with special powers.<br/><br/>The game flows out on a board where players can develop different strategies and should capture the god Ka / Ra to win the game.<br/><br/>But like in ancient Egypt, the Nile River has its importance random events creating different depending on the date provided by the board calendar, which is responsible for registering the course of days and nights of the week is up, which turn up the months of the year according to the ancient Egyptians saw, besides other event has been included as a force that is even above the gods who make up the game, this is Khepri the Egyptian scarab.<br/><br/>As in the game of chess mathematical possibilities are endless, but PiramiKa not a game of chess and each player can plan a strategy to capture the god Ra / Ka of his opponent in many different ways.<br/><br/>Battles are an important part of the game, various meetings with Khepri the beetle will have their importance if exceeded, each god may assert his power, but if he loses the game shall be removed and this battle can not be avoided, as to the battles between gods a balanced strategy can result in losing or winning the game.<br/><br/>On components of the game are easy to manufacture and this PnP version I included only black and white for anyone who wishes to try the game.<br/><br/>The game is complete and tested, with special care the balance between players and relation to the different components, a large development behind this game is based on the understanding the world who had the ancient Egyptians, as well as an equally important support in mathematics they used.<br/><br/>Definitely try to create a balanced game with a strong mathematical basis while the chance may frustrate the most brilliant strategic plans established by the players, so the perfect balance between them will win the player plus a proper strategic approach in as far as possible take into account the possibility that chance might hold both players during the course of the game.<br/><br/><br/>PiramiKa es un juego de tablero que basa sus fichas en antiguos dioses egipcios y su cultura.<br/><br/>En alg&uacute;n momento de la historia las fichas de los juegos egipcios tomaron forma y naci&oacute; el ajedrez.<br/><br/>Este juego es un intento por devolver las fichas a un tablero donde las fichas son dioses egipcios a los que dependiendo de la naturaleza de cada dios se les doto de poderes especiales.<br/><br/>El juego se trascurre en un tablero donde los jugadores podr&aacute;n desarrollar diferentes estrategias y deber&aacute;n capturar al dios Ka/Ra para ganar el juego.<br/><br/>Pero al igual que en el antiguo Egipto, el ri&oacute; Nilo tendr&aacute; su importancia creando diferentes eventos aleatorios dependiendo de la fecha que proporciona el tablero calendario, que es el encargado de registrar el trascurso de d&iacute;as y noches de las que se componen las semanas, que a su vez componen los meses del a&ntilde;o seg&uacute;n los ve&iacute;an los antiguos egipcios, ademas otro evento ha sido incluido como una fuerza que esta incluso por encima de los dioses que componen el juego, este es Jepri el escarabajo egipcio.<br/><br/>Al igual que en el juego del ajedrez las posibilidades matem&aacute;ticas son infinitas, pero PiramiKa no es un juego de ajedrez y cada jugador puede planear una estrategia para capturar al dios de Ra/Ka  de su oponente de muy diferentes formas.<br/><br/>Las batallas son una parte importante del juego, los diferentes encuentros con Jepri el escarabajo tendr&aacute;n su importancia si es superada, cada dios podr&aacute; hacer valer su poder, pero si pierde deber&aacute; ser retirado del juego y esta batalla no podr&aacute; ser evitada, en cuanto a la batallas entre dioses una equilibrada estrategia puede dar como resultado el perder o ganar la partida.<br/><br/>Sobre los componentes del juego son de una f&aacute;cil fabricaci&oacute;n y en este PnP solo inclu&iacute; la versi&oacute;n en blanco y negro para quien lo desee pueda probar el juego.<br/><br/>El juego esta completo y comprobado, cuide especialmente el equilibrio entre jugadores y relaci&oacute;n con los diferentes componentes, hay un gran desarrollo detr&aacute;s de este juego que est&aacute; basado en la forma de entender el mundo que ten&iacute;an los antiguos egipcios, as&iacute; como un no menos importante apoyo en las matem&aacute;ticas que utilizaron.<br/><br/>En definitiva intente crear un juego equilibrado con una importante base matem&aacute;tica a la vez que el azar puede malograr los m&aacute;s brillantes planes estrat&eacute;gicos establecidos por los jugadores, de esta forma el perfecto equilibrio entre ambos dar&aacute;n la victoria al jugador que adem&aacute;s de un planteamiento estrat&eacute;gico correcto, en medida de lo posible tenga en cuenta las posibilidades que el azar pueda deparar a ambos jugadores durante el trascurso de la partida.<br/><br/>",

Players take the roles of pirate captains and compete against each other by raiding merchant ships for trade goods and treasure that earn them Victory Points. They also must visit friendly ports to trade goods, add new crew members, and purchase arms and equipment. These new crew members, arms, and equipment cards are added to their decks.<br/><br/>The board is a map of the Caribbean with a hexagonal grid. Players move on the edges of the hexes while the merchant ships move from one hex to the next. A player may engage a ship in battle when its ship is on a hex edge adjacent to a merchant ship. Once an enemy ship is defeated in naval combat the player may initiate boarding combat.<br/><br/>Both naval and boarding combat are resolved through the player's Naval Combat and Boarding Combat decks. An additional six-sided die is added to the combat score.<br/><br/>The game ends when the Admiral of the Black (the leader of the pirates) is defeated and a new Admiral of the Black is declared by the player with the most Victory Points.<br/><br/>",

On some fields, they are allowed to move ahead fast because of &quot;excellent performances&quot;, other field lets them fall behind for &quot;insufficient performances&quot;. When a player reaches the 30th field of the track, his or her plastic cosmonaut is inserted into a plastic rocket and is ready for take-off. After rolling a six, the rocket is moved along a path to a distant planet, and the game turns into a basic roll and move game. After skipping a turn on the planet, players take off again and reach earth again on a different path. The first player to return home safely is the winner.<br/><br/>The game is free of political agitation and focusses on the hardships of the cosmonaut's training. It is remarkable that this ancient game (which has only two pages of rules anyway) contains a rule overview on the back side of the rule booklet.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Typical of this game in the public domain, each player deploys one&rsquo;s own fleet of five ships on a ten-by-ten square grid that is hidden from the opponent. Because each ship consists of a series of pegs that are the same color rather than physical ship, units may be placed on the grid diagonally as well orthogonally. In turn, each player shoots at the other's grid by calling a location. The defender responds by &quot;Hit!&quot; when the call happens to be the location of a unit or &quot;Miss!&quot; when a unit is not located there. Each player tries to deduce where the enemy ships are and sink them. First to do so wins. Players use an erasable crayon to record calls on a second smaller grid.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Jesus Christ has promised us that he will be returning, and as a follower of Christ we know that this is true. But what about the people that don't know? Jesus gave us our great commission to go into all the corners of the world and share the gospel, and that is exactly what we will do. <br/><br/>Your character cards will be your friends, your family and your fellow church members, each with their own set of unique skills and encouragements. When a coal is separate from the fire, it grows cold. Keep great people around you and your faith will grow.<br/><br/>You will also have support, in the form of churches, bible studies, small groups and even education. These support cards will stay in play and give you greater opportunities to travel and spread out across the world. But the mission field starts right at home, will you witness to your neighbor or to a total stranger?<br/><br/>You may travel across the entire globe on mission trips. Some may be only for a single turn (think of it as a youth group trip to the Ukraine or Mexico) and some may take over the rest of the game (such as settling a family in another country, or becoming a pastor for a military branch overseas). Wherever you go, you will always have people to witness to.<br/><br/>The win condition. Sharing Christ's love is not a race, and cannot be kept track of via face down prizes or a life total. So we create a new card type, the Mission card. Therefore go into all of the world, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them and and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you. Each player will have at least one Mission card within their deck, and when you have met your requirements listed on the mission card, you can reveal it to your opponent. The first player to finish their mission does not automatically win however, as the game is not a race. Instead, each Mission has an assigned point value based on its difficulty, and when one player runs out of cards in their deck, whoever has more Mission points wins that game.<br/><br/>Don't think for a moment that lower point values are easy and high point values are hard, remember the woman who gave two coins? Her gifts to the Father were greater than those of the rich men.<br/><br/>",

After the game is played with the kids, the months of the trimesters can be crossed off the board as the months pass so that children will get an idea of when the baby will arrive!<br/><br/>This project is a fast moving, hilarious and exciting game for baby showers and couples and family game nights. The game takes an unlimited amount of baby shower guests through delightful scenes of the 3 trimesters of pregnancy as players move their cute minature pink and blue milk bottle tokens up the game board -- from the 1st trimester when the father starts sweating and yanking his collar loose when the doctor tells him he's going to be a daddy, to the 2nd trimester where the now obviously pregnant wife is instructing the bewildered husband to repaint the nursery, and to the 3rd trimester where the anxious mom on a gurney nearly chokes the daddy as she clutches his tie on the way to the delivery room -- while teams take turns trying to draw baby-related words and phrases from the cards in the card box on pink and blue scratchpads. As their teammates successfully guess the word or phrase being drawn, they advance their milk bottle tokens up the gameboard to the Special Deivery space to &quot;deliver their baby.&quot; Hilarious sketches and guesses encite non-stop laughter.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Astromino -- Dominoes of the Universe<br/><br/>This is a new twist on the age old theme of Domino games from times past. Astromino uses the universe, space travel as an overall game theme. The tiles have the form of the Kite and the Dart, original shapes developed by Sir Roger Penrose as a part of his tiling research projects in the 1970&lsquo;s. When &ldquo;Dominized&rdquo; these unique shapes open a new set of possibilities for Domino game design and play. Astromino Basic, Full and Advanced Sets are recommended for ages 8 through 101 years. We have play tested Astromino and to date it has done well with all age groups. This Kickstarter Project will be a mega play testing opportunity. The tiles can also be used as blocks or a puzzle just to form shapes and make patterns, it is one way of playing solitaire Astromino.<br/><br/>Astromino Game Sets<br/><br/>     The Basic Astromino Game includes 60 tiles (30 Kites and 30 Darts) with sharp gray scale graphics. Basic game instructions are included.<br/>     The Full Astromino Game includes 100 tiles (50 Kites and 50 Darts) with four color graphics. Full game instructions are included with this set of tiles.  Two playing surfaces for the more complex games, approximately 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; with game instructions make the Full set into an Advanced Game of Astromino.<br/><br/><br/>Astromino Game Play Basics<br/><br/>     To start the game &ldquo;Big Bang&rdquo; the tiles, i.e. shuffle or mix them face down on a large table top to form the &ldquo;Galaxy&rdquo;. Now choose a tile to determine who starts the game. The player with the highest double tile will be the starter. Once the starter is determined the other players return the tile to the Galaxy as the starter places his double to start the game.<br/>     Now each player will choose their own hand from the Galaxy, 5 Kites and 5 Darts. Each contestant plays one tile per turn from their hand of ten tiles, matching like numbers on the tiles, long edges to long edges and short to short. The basic game continues as a string of connected shapes the Moon and the Star take shape. These shapes Moon and Star must be formed using 5 Kites or 5 Darts, respectively. The shapes are assembled and connected, one to another as the game proceeds. The string of shapes undulates and forms the line of play, always a unique field of play. Like Domino games a typical hand in an Astromino game will last between 15 and 25 minutes.<br/>     Tiles may fit here or there and need to be turned and matched in your head as you choose your next move. Careful don&rsquo;t make an &ldquo;Anti-matter&rdquo; move or if caught you will lose your turn! Strategy comes into play as you make plans for your next move to defeat your favorite opponent(s).  Hide your tiles using the Player Tray.<br/>     If you are lucky maybe you can &ldquo;Shoot the Moon&rdquo;, it is a play where you complete any shape and clear your hand by playing two (2) or more tiles all at once. Astromino rules include many options so you can choose from them and play the game as you like it.<br/><br/><br/>Game Options<br/><br/>     There are six diferent games each one can incorporate these options to some degree.  Play options include Rule of Seven, Blank is a wild to play, Add a Shape,  Shoot the Moon, and scoring sevens or just scoring tile values with extra points for completing a shape.<br/><br/><br/>Winning the Game<br/><br/>     Although optional scoring rules are included, the main goal of the game is to use all the Astromino tiles in your hand. When you are down to your last Astromino tile yell &ldquo;ASTEROID!&rdquo; Fair warning to the opponents you are about to defeat. You win the hand when all your tiles are played. You win the game when you win two hands.  Maybe you will be lucky enough to &ldquo;Shoot the Moon&rdquo; for the win.<br/><br/><br/>Six Unique Games in one!<br/><br/>     Basic Line of Play Game<br/>     Moons and Stars Game<br/>     Sun, Earth and Moon Game<br/>     Sumerian Sevens and Twelves Game<br/>     Freeform Penrose Tiling Game<br/>     Four-Stage-Star Game<br/><br/><br/>",

The primary purpose of Live It Up is to be used as an educational tool, but it is an enjoyable game that can be played casually by adults and young people as well.<br/><br/>Live It Up is a useful visual, audio, and kinetic learning tool. Parents and Educators can play Live It Up with their preteens and teens, while Therapists also will find Live It Up useful for rehab patients.<br/><br/>Live It Up is played with five kinds of cards: Live, Activity, Arrest, Overdose, and Sober cards. The cards are laid out face down on the table. Each player chooses cards and stacks them until they receive a Live card, in which case their turn is up. If a player pulls an Arrest card, their stack of cards go into Jail, only to be redeemed by a player who pulls a Sober card. If a player pulls an Overdose, all their cards go to The Grave, never to be played again. Players can choose to redeem their Sober cards whenever on their turn they wish, but the longer they wait, the more they risk having their own cards sent to Jail or the Grave. The object of the game is to build the most fulfilling life, and the player with the greatest stack of Live, Activity, and/or Sober cards wins.<br/><br/>",

They will place these 6 'workers' on action spaces such as: Drop off Demo tapes, Hang up Concert Posters, Record Album, Buy/Sell Gear, etc...<br/><br/>Phase 2 is a cash auction for Booking Agents which will lend their precious 'Leverage' to the band to get them gigs for the weekend.<br/><br/>Phase 3 is an auction using the Booking Agents' leverage to try to secure the best gigs for the weekend. Players can pick up gigs for Friday and/or Saturday.<br/><br/>Once the bidding is over, or all players have 2 gigs, players will 'play' their gigs. Add the band's confidence to 1D6 and compare to the difficulty of each gig to see if the Band bombed or blew the roof off! Increase your fame accordingly, get paid and cash in on royalties.<br/><br/>When the last gig card is drawn, complete that round. Whichever player has the most Fame, is the winner!<br/><br/>",

It uses a 4&times;4-holed board, and balls in three colors (white, black, and red).<br/><br/>Aim: Make a full line (orthogonal or diagonal) of your color on a level, or get 9 of your balls on the board, or place the top piece of the pyramid, or (if both players run out of balls to play) have more of your balls in play than your opponent and more of yours than neutral balls.<br/><br/>Rules: The 4&times;4 board starts empty. Each player (White and Black) starts with his 16 balls, and 8 of the red neutral balls. Keep this supply of 24 balls hidden from your opponent at all times during the game. Use an opaque container (e.g. the Shibumi bag) to receive rejected balls over the course of the game. It should be able to hold all 48 balls, just in case. Never look in this reject bag during the game.<br/>On your turn, hide any one or two balls total from your supply into your two hands. Each hand now has zero or one ball in it. Now present your closed fists to your opponent. Your opponent must sit still (no leaning and peeking), then touch one of your fists. Put the ball in this hand (if any) on the growing pyramid. Put the other hand (without looking!) into the reject bag, and release the ball (if any). Always do this, even if the other hand is empty, in order to keep your opponent guessing as to which balls you have left. If you run out of balls before your opponent, simply pass each turn until the game is over: You will still select which hand your opponent gets to play each turn.<br/><br/>",

At the outset of the game, each player places three pieces on each tile in the two lanes s/he can use. <br/>Afterwards, the players take turns picking up all the pieces from one tile, then moving the pieces onward in the designated direction (the tracks are one-way and form a &quot;round&quot; track for each player, with the middle track being part of both players' tracks). At each tile they pass, they have to drop one piece. In the middle, they can choose which color to drop (if they have both colors in their hand), but when they reach the end of the middle track, the pieces are split up and continue their path in the different outer tracks. <br/>If a tile on the outer tracks ever contains more than six pieces, that tile is removed together with all the pieces on it.<br/>During the game, there are scorings at partially random moments. Each player counts the number of pieces on his or her outer track and gets points accordingly.<br/>The game ends when one player has less than three tiles in his or her outer track. Then a final scoring is done, with the other player scoring double. The player with most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "[GreekGuardians.com]<br/>Theme:<br/>Greece of yesterday was a different place than it is today. The age of Ancient Greece was frought with peril, sacrifice and prayer. To get anything done, people would pray to the gods for favor. To complicate matters, the right prayer had to reach the right deity in order to have any chance at success. It was very confusing and complicated life. To simplify this vast set of choices a Greek everyman or everywoman would face, I have chosen two paths that you and your opponents must set your sights towards. Order and Chaos, both are neutral, they are not bad or good in the classical sense, but rather a point of view. By the end of the first players turn, each player must align with Order or Chaos and build their strategies and play their cards towards that means.<br/><br/>Goal:<br/>Each player draws cards that move players towards your final goal of 21 culture points. Each action, each king, queen, god, monster, philosopher, literally each card can either add or subtract culture points, cause mayhem, deny abilities, outright kill foes, or otherwise meddle towards your cause or to take an opponent away from their cause, for your chosen faction (Order or Chaos). There is one initial turn to set up and identify which faction, Chaos or Order, you will be gaining points towards and then there are 4 turns, one per season: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter. If a player does not reach 21 culture points, at the final play of Winter, the player with the highest amount of culture points WINS!<br/><br/>Game-Play:<br/>Players will determine who goes first and will draw (and play) cards in the correct slots (Gods, Titans, Stars, etc.) and each card will have passive and active effects that resolve at the end of each player's turn. There is a (normal sheet of paper size) game board that shows where different cards &quot;live&quot; Passive effects will usually be &quot;Add one culture point towards either Order or Chaos&quot; (depending on the Card's Alignment). Active effects (or action cards) will require using action points (each player gets 5 action points per turn; the game has 4 turns total, so each play and card management is very important) that can alter the landscape of the game and change fates FAST.<br/><br/>Unique Feature (Stacking):<br/>Say a certain God card is played (let's say Zeus) and he is Chaos aligned. And say there is a chaos aligned star already in its slot and another chaos aligned Titan in her slot. There is a bonus, or stacking, effect of having a bunch of &quot;like-minded&quot; cards, so this combination of three cards (each say producing one chaos token for this turn, 1+1+1=3) there would be a +2 chaos bonus. So if the player can navigate the correct stacking of &quot;like-minded&quot; or similarly aligned cards, there are bonus effects that can speed up your plan (OR slow down opponents).<br/><br/>",

Each player has 5 pieces, numbered 1 through 5, which all start on their back row. It is suggested that the initial arrangement of pieces on the back row be selected randomly.<br/><br/>Players take turns pushing pieces forwards. A 'push' consists of pushing a piece one space forward, onto the space immediately ahead or the ones onto the left or right of that. A player may either push just the 1 piece forwards, or push forwards a piece and pull back the piece one size less onto any of the three squares behind it. For example, they may push forwards the 4 and pull back the 3, but not push forwards the 4 and pull back the 2, or just push forwards the 4 without pulling anything back.<br/><br/>A piece may not be pushed or pulled onto an occupied square, but a piece may push back a smaller opposing piece onto any of the three squares behind it. The person doing the pushing decides which square the opposing piece gets pushed onto.<br/><br/>The pieces moved on a single turn are considered to move simultaneously, so for example it's possible for the 2 and 1 to swap positions if the 1 is in front of the 2.<br/><br/>The first player to not have a legal move wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fast play rules for Napoleonic Wargaming c.1805 to 1815. A soft cover book of 38 pages in black &amp; white print.<br/>Tremble ye Tyrants! is a set of rules for medium to large scale wargames set in the last decade or so of the Napoleonic Wars, or roughly between 1805 and 1815. This is the classic Napoleonic &ldquo;Empire&rdquo; period, including the great campaigns of Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau and Friedland, Aspern and Wagram, as well as the invasions of Spain and Russia, and the decisive allied victories at Leipzig and Waterloo. Tabletop armies can represent a wide variety of real life levels of organisation, from a division up to a full scale army.<br/><br/>Tremble ye Tyrants! is aimed at players who want a fast playing and enjoyable game with a minimum of complex mechanisms, but which retains as much as possible of the tactical flavour of the period, and makes large scale manoeuvres feasible within the confines of an evening&rsquo;s game. Although designed mainly with 28mm figures in mind, it is suitable for any scale and any size of game.<br/><br/>",

No-one has ever escaped from Alcatraz, but that's about to change.<br/><br/>One player will take the role of the Prison Station Officer, charged with keeping everyone in prison until the end of his shift on the station, the rest of the players will take the part of the prisoners; working together (or sometimes against each other), to escape before the current shift ends and they are all placed into cryo-stasis for the next hundred years - trapped until their next opportunity to try and escape comes along.<br/><br/>The game is an action point based system, with the prisoners using their points to search for escape items, hide in vents, avoid patrolling guards and construct their escape plans and the Station Officer using his to perform sweeps, change robot patrol orders, search for stashes and activate the deadly, deadly vent cleaning laser grid.  Play continues for a number of turns until either one player has managed to free their entire team of convicts or cryo-sleep time kicks in.  If escapes have happened, but enough prisoners have been kept in Alcatraz then the Prison Officer gets a stern telling off but is the winner, otherwise the player who has managed to free the most valuable members of their team (or escape first in the case of a tie) wins!<br/><br/>So bolt together your space glider, hitch a lift on a passing transport ship or just make a break for it across the asteroid towards an arranged rendezvous and get the heck out of here!<br/><br/>1st Draft has neared completion, and testing is underway.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Four angry, hungry worms battle it out for food. They want to grow longer and heavier. And they have it in for their opponents.<br/><br/>During the game, players will want to make their worm grow. At the same time, a vital part of battle is to protect the weaker parts of the worms' bodies (mainly the head) by utilizing the cover available in the playing area. They will also try to weaken the enemy worms either through battle or by eating their food.<br/><br/>But all this can't be done at the same time. For instance, you can't eat and fight. Good worms never shoot with their mouths full. So certain decisions must be made. Should they engage in battle or fulfill their hunger? Should they eat food of their own color or that of their enemies? Will they use the food they ate to grow longer or to gain in bulk? Or maybe they should grab that token which will allow them to draw some cards. And what if that bomb detonates when they get close to it?<br/><br/>Depending on the size of their worm, each player has a certain number of dice available to them.  These can be used to pay for the cost of Action cards he wishes to play, to move his worm, to defend his worm, etc.<br/><br/>Each player has a hand limit of 8 cards. There are two types of card. Action cards allow the player to take certain good or bad actions. Dice cards are used as dice.<br/><br/>To cut a long story short....... is reminiscent of an arcade game from a decade or two ago.<br/><br/>",

The design system is simple. but comprehensive.<br/><br/>The game uses an alternating activating system.  When a unit is activated it has a certain nmuber of action points (typically 2, but more for heroes) that it can spend to perform actions in the game, including movement, attacks, and trasnforming.  Combat is handled via a d20 roll against a target number, which is defined by various modifiers such as the attacker's tech level, target's size, range, &amp; weapon accuracy.  If a hit is scored, damage is rolled against the target's armor.<br/><br/>",

The clan with the most widespread structure wins the game.<br/><br/>The 10 different pieces made of strong cardboard have recessions and connectiong cones similar to a jigsaw puzzle. They stand symbolically for love, night, luck, possession, life, success, youth, mind and power.<br/>The player can can 'purchase' them by rolling a 10-sided die and include them into the existing dynasty.<br/><br/>At the beginning every player receives four figures: Two adult figures, a heart and a cloverleaf which stand for love and luck. A family is founded whith these and can be extended with dice-luck and also with tactical planning. In addition to the dice result you can receive points from chips.<br/><br/>Some examples of dice results:<br/>With a thrown '4' you purchase a house, which stands for possession and security. Mind and enducation (symbolized by a star) are added into the dynasty by rolling an '8'. When a '2' is rolled, the moon signals night, end of luck and a stroke of fate; the player should get rid of it again as soon as possible. With a '7' a child (boy/girl) comes into the dynasty, which stands for future and development. A second child in the dynasty will form the foundation for further generations in the construction of the dynasty.<br/><br/>The numerological and color-psychological background on which the game is based are explained in the appendix of the rules of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The first set of cards is the initial deck, the first movie Zombie Hospital that we wrote for the Director&rsquo;s Cut Survival Horror role-playing system. There are card sets for two more movies, and plans to release expansions of items and characters at set times during the year. The plan is to write more movies for the Director&rsquo;s Cut Survival Horror role-playing system and convert them over to the collectible card game. The premise is that anyone can pick up a deck and start playing. The goal of this game is to simply survive the movie, with fewer injuries than your opponents.<br/><br/>Each game consists of a 50-card Scene Deck, required to play the game. The Scene Deck is the movie as a whole. Each player has a deck of 50 cards that they have compiled from the available cards and one archetype card. The archetype is the character they are playing in the movie. Each deck is filled with Items, Actions, and Skills to handle the scenes as well as Wounds and other cards that affect game play and the other players.<br/><br/>While the card game is ideal for two or even eight players, because players are playing against Scenes as well as other players, this game can be played in a solitaire fashion. The whole premise of the game is to recreate surviving a horror movie, without too many rules to learn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Orkhorde is a card game based around the daily life of an orc horde. Planning their actions, the orcs can decide to favor their own tribe or to cooperate with larger raids. In the end, it's important how many trophies the tribes gather.<br/><br/>Each game turn, each tribe decides for its members how much work they will spend at the tasks, which is limited by the health of the orcs. Afterwards, these tasks are resolved: the shaman runs a ritual assisted by the other orcs to improve the warbands' chances, the male orcs go hunting alone and as the big warband, the female orcs educate the children and gather fruits and herbs, and in the end the orcs have a chance to improve their position in the pecking order by fighting their immediate superiors. Hunting, raiding and fighting for a better place in the pecking order can net an orc not only food &ndash; orcs that go hungry, starve and lose health and thus have fewer activity points to spend for tasks &ndash; but also trophies (trophy points) which determine which tribe is the most successful in the end. Part of the rule system has been taken from Wolfsspuren and is used with permission.<br/><br/>Due to the planning phase and inter-horde rivalries, there is lots of competition and backstabbing as well.<br/><br/>",

You have chosen to throw your hat in the ring hoping to become the most powerful person in the world, the leader of the free world, the President of the United States. But to get there you must fight all the others who want the same prize. The fight is guaranteed to be dirty with all the Media Frenzy surrounding it.<br/><br/>In this lighthearted dig at American presidential politics players take on the role of candidates like Congressman Daddy&rsquo;s Boy or Senator Green with attributes like Tree Hugger, Veteran, Fat Cat, Religious, etc. and compete to win the delegates from twenty-one groups of states or Regions like Hurricane Landfall (the Carolinas), Extra Shipping (Hawaii &amp; Alaska), and Second Biggest (Texas).<br/><br/>Who doesn&rsquo;t know what politics and elections are about? The candidates definitely do&hellip; and so they start with a war chest of funds ranging from $4 million to $10 million. Once used, the funds are gone till the next round of seven regions. So candidates must choose where to use how much carefully. They can also choose to stay out of the race in a region and instead use the funds to Dig for Dirt on the competition.<br/><br/>Each of the regions have their preferences for what kind of candidates they like, so if your attributes match that of a region, your funds go further, and vice versa. But once the campaign funds are spent the outcome is not guaranteed for the leader in spending. That&rsquo;s when the Media Frenzy begins! Candidates can now play to the Media and either bring-out Support or Protest Rallies, they can use the dirt they collected and expose Scandals about the competition. Each media event can make your spending go further or not so much.<br/><br/>Candidates must be careful not to indulge the media too much, because if more than one person is spending at the same level, the fickle crowd tunes them out, and the highest unique spender win the delegates.<br/><br/>We hope you have the support of your base, you have the fortitude to let a few protests roll off your back, and you don&rsquo;t have too many scandals in your past. If you do&hellip; you might just be the next Commander in Chief!<br/><br/>",

It's a great beer and peanuts game, and lavishly illustrated.<br/><br/>This game is a cross between an RPG and a miniatures game. Players command a squad of 12 humans as they battle their way into a  randomly generated maze of corridors.

With luck, it will settle into one of the holes and the player scores points for where it has ended up. The winner would be the first to reach a pre-agreed total.<br/><br/>This doesn't seem to have any skill at all. You cannot influence the speed of the ball so it is sheer luck where it ends up.
