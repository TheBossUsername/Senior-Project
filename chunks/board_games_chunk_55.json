Only by destroying all of their motherships will you halt the alien advance.<br/><br/>Megablast is a solo deck building game, inspired by the shoot 'em up video games of the 90s.<br/>Blast your way through three levels of alien waves. For each kill you add an upgrade on TOP of your deck. You must balance your deck between weapons, engines, and tech systems to survive. There is no deck shuffling so you can manipulate your deck to unleash devastating combos to defeat the end of level bosses and win.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY OVERVIEW<br/>The game is played over three levels. During each level you will face four waves of alien ships, and then must defeat the end of level boss. When you defeat the third and final boss you win the game. You will also encounter asteroids, meteors and other hazards.<br/><br/>Enemies spawn in the top row of a 4 x 3 grid. They move down the grid towards your ship before either flying off the bottom, or being destroyed by your attacks. You must maneuver your ship to avoid enemy fire whilst trying to defeat as many of them as possible.<br/><br/>For each level of the game, there is a deck of upgrade cards for your ship. When you defeat a wave of aliens, you gain a new card of the current level. When you defeat a boss, you gain a card of the next level. Use card actions to attack, move, defend, and draw &amp; play extra cards. Decide what to play, hold, and discard to set up powerful combos.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This book gives you everything you need to begin building your D-Day: Waffen-SS force.<br/><br/>Between mid 1943 and mid 1944, the German focus was on the Eastern Front. After the failure of the German Kursk Offensive, the Red Army went on the offensive, throwing hammer blow after hammer blow to drive the Germans back to the Russian border. The elite 1st and 2nd SS Panzer Divisions were rushed to wherever the Soviets broke through, counterattacking to seal the breach. By Christmas, the divisions were worn out, barely a regimental sized battlegroup remained. They desperately needed to be withdrawn to France to rebuild back to full strength.<br/><br/>Then, as 1944 began, the Red Army attacked again. The two new divisions being formed in France, the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions were rushed to the Eastern Front and the plans to rebuild the existing divisions were shelved. Finally, in March, the Spring rains turned the roads to mud and the Soviet offensives ground to a halt. All four divisions were returned to France for rebuilding, joining the 12th SS Panzer Division which was part way through its training. Six weeks into their training, still trying to bring large numbers of conscripted replacements up to scratch, the Allies invaded France on D-Day. Ready or not, the SS panzer divisions were rushed to the invasion front, counterattacking to drive the Allies back into the sea.<br/><br/>With a solid core of veteran leaders under your command, can your willing, but inexperienced troops defeat the Allies despite their massive superiority in numbers? Can you win a never-ending battle of attrition, or do you attack into the teeth of massed artillery, naval bombardments and airpower? Can you defeat the invasion and save your homeland?<br/><br/>Forces details on:<br/><br/>     Tiger SS Tank Company<br/>     Panther SS Tank Company<br/>     Panzer IV SS Tank Company<br/>     StuG SS Tank Company<br/>     SS Panzergrenadier Company<br/>     SS Reconnaissance Company Company<br/>     Support<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The challenge is that every piece played features both your color and the color of your opponent!<br/><br/>The playing area is a hexagon composed of 19 smaller hexagons. Each player starts with nine hexagon tiles that are half light and half dark, and one tile starts in the center of the playing area. On a turn, place a tile in any orientation you choose on any unoccupied space of the playing area. If this placement fills the last empty space around another tile, you must rotate that newly surrounded tile 60&ordm; either clockwise or counterclockwise. (If you surround multiple tiles at the same time, you rotate only one of these surrounded tiles.)<br/><br/>If you create a block of seven tiles that have your color connected across them, you win the game. If all the tiles have been placed without someone winning instantly, whoever has the largest block of color wins, with ties being broken in favor of the starting player.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>このゲームは2人用の本格的なアブストラクトゲームです。<br/><br/>六角形のタイルをおく！<br/>タイルを囲んでまわす！<br/>自分の色をつなげる！<br/>たくさんつなげたら勝ち！<br/><br/>非常にシンプルなルールなので誰でもすぐに遊ぶことができます。<br/>六角形のタイルを回すだけで驚くほど状況が変化するため、高い思考力を必要とするゲームになりました。<br/>タイルを置く場所や向きを少し変えるだけで勝敗に大きく影響するため、飽きることなく何度でも遊ぶことができます。<br/><br/>アブストラクトゲームが得意な人でもこのゲームを極めるのは簡単ではないでしょう。<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary (Japanese)<br/><br/>",

By late December the British XXX Corps was heavily involved in helping push back the German Sixth Panzer Army, advancing alongside the Americans to erase all German gains by early January.<br/><br/>The Battle of the Bulge is rightly celebrated as an American victory; most troops involved were Americans, and most casualties likewise were Americans. But the British Army fought as well, and we celebrate their victories over fascism as well.<br/><br/>Requires Elsenborn Ridge and Liberation 1944 to play all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>",

DICEWAR invigorates dice-rolling with a ground-breaking fervor and hostility that will make you forget everything you ever knew about dice.<br/><br/>Dicewar is a round-by-round competition to be the first player to reach 6 points. To have any chance at the win, players must balance strong dice-rolling with strategic action card playing.<br/><br/>2-5 players are given 3 rolls per round to achieve familiar dice combinations like Large Straight, 4-of-a-kind, and Full House. The player with the best roll at the end of a round wins a point AND and action card. With 10 different action card types, players can use cards to steal dice from their opponents, skip their opponents' turn, and even make their opponent &quot;respect the ones&quot;.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the Second World War, several Eastern European nations fielded flotillas of river monitors - armored, shallow-draft warships that operated on the great rivers. These gunboats (anything on a river is a &ldquo;boat&rdquo; no matter its size) were designed to provide artillery support, engage enemy troops and if necessary, to fight other river monitors.<br/><br/>River Battleships introduces these armored warships to Panzer Grenadier. These are the actual river warships that served Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Germany, Yugoslavia, Croatia, Austria and the Soviet Union. There are 45 river monitor pieces (the same size as the ship pieces in our naval games), 32 slightly smaller river gunboat pieces, 50 special markers for the river craft and 64 standard Panzer Grenadier sized pieces with troops, weapons and leaders.<br/><br/>River Battleships is a complete game, with two 11x17-inch maps showing the beautiful blue Danube (or Dnepr, or Pripyet) in its full watery glory, a full set of Panzer Grenadier series game rules and charts, special rules for riverine combat, and sixteen new scenarios featuring river monitor action (plus one introductory scenario with just ground units).<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

He leads his group of Gorechosen to the very nadir of the Nethermaze, where he plans to enact a grand blood ritual upon tectonic weak points to wound Ulgu itself, sending black, liquid lava spilling into the seas above, and thereby poisoning them beyond recovery. His companions are the Skullgrinder Herax, a creator of grim and bloody artefacts, and the muscle-bound Gorehulk, an ex-Slaughterpriest who is now more akin to a beast than man. Nothing will stop Dromm in his quest to bleed Ulgu dry.<br/><br/>The Gorechosen of Dromm offer a ritualistic approach to the violent worship of Khorne. The warband claims blood tithe tokens by dealing and suffering damage throughout the battle, then expends them to fuel powerful abilities &ndash; such as Dromm's unique Enrage action, which can send friend and foe charging across the Nethermaze in a frenzy. This box includes a complete Rivals deck, plus loads of extra cards allowing you to try out a few tricks, as well as universal cards and Grand Alliance cards to use with your other warbands.<br/><br/>This set includes:<br/>- 3x push-fit Gorechosen of Dromm miniatures &ndash; no glue required to assemble, cast in bloody red plastic to stand out even when unpainted.<br/>- 3x double-sided fighter cards, one for each warrior in the warband &ndash; Skullgrinder Herax, the Gorehulk, and Dromm, Wounder of Worlds.<br/>- A further 66 cards to enhance your fighters and provide new tactics and challenges for your games of Warhammer Underworlds: Nethermaze, including:<br/>&ndash; 12x Gorechosen of Dromm objective cards<br/>&ndash; 10x Gorechosen of Dromm upgrade cards<br/>&ndash; 10x Gorechosen of Dromm gambit cards (includes 3x Domain card)<br/>&ndash; 6x Universal objective cards, usable by any warband<br/>&ndash; 7x Universal upgrade cards, usable by any warband (includes 1x Map card and 1x Domain card)<br/>&ndash; 7x Universal gambit cards, usable by any warband (includes 2x Domain cards)<br/>&ndash; 12x Grand Alliance cards, usable by any warband belonging to the specified Grand Alliance<br/>&ndash; 1x Gorechosen of Dromm Warband Background / Rivals Deck Card<br/>&ndash; 1x cover card<br/><br/>",

As the commander of a Sherman M4A3 tank, your ultimate goal is to survive the 'Battle of the Bulge' until late January 1945, while at the same time killing as many German enemy units as possible.<br/><br/>With most of the rules integrated into the tables, there is practically no learning curve or rules memorization. And with detailed damage modeling, numerous crewmen skills, 12 types of enemy German Army units, battle weather effects, terrain types, random events, and a multitude of table modifiers, Tank Commander: The Ardennes offers memorable experiences and high replay value. Are you up to the challenge of surviving the Battle of the Bulge?<br/><br/>The player will move his tank around on the combat mat, fighting enemy units.<br/><br/>Game components include a crewmen placement mat, combat mat, tables book, crewmen status sheet, campaign log sheet, and counter sheet representing individual tanks, enemy units, etc.<br/><br/>",

In the Fortify Stage, all players take each turn simultaneously, drafting 1 card to place defenders into their dungeon. In the Exchange Stage, players exchange dungeons. Each player shuffles their cards to form a personal draw pile. In the Crawl Stage, all players take each turn simultaneously, using 1 of their cards to clear defenders from their opponent&rsquo;s dungeon.<br/><br/>The game ends for everyone when a player finishes clearing their opponent&rsquo;s dungeon.

Try to maneuver your airships to group them by color so that they stack to score increasingly more points. Unfortunately, with each new ship entering your station, its movement will trigger the rearranging of previously placed airships, so ideally you can race other skyport owners around a central rondel to choose the incoming airships that are best for you.<br/><br/>Drafting tycoons to your skyport will bring unique advantages in manipulating your docked airships, as well as additional scoring opportunities at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Do you have the operational skills to handle the airships arriving at your station as efficiently as possible?

Pick the ID, U-boot nickname and Kommandant name.<br/><br/>Place the U-BOOT markers at the first black dot to the right of the Approach box and the other one on top of the U-BOOT Depth box. Place the Escort marker on top of the Escort box.<br/><br/>Now you are ready to start your patrol.<br/><br/>THE GAME<br/><br/>Step 1: The Approach: Roll 2d6 to find out the events for the day. Check under the Approach box and resolve event.<br/><br/>Step 2: If you roll a SIGHTING, roll 3d6 and total it. Place the 3 dice (they represent 3 ships of a Convoy you Sighted) at that range total. Example: The roll is an 8, place dice on the Medium Rage (7-12)<br/><br/>Step 3: Roll 1d6 for the Weather/Time of Day.<br/><br/>Now you may decide if you want to engage the Convoy. Night and bad weather can really hurt your chances of accomplishing your mission before the Convoy gets away or you get chased off by an Escort...choose your engagements wisely. You are never obligated to engage with a Convoy but don't forget...your main goal is to sink as many merchant ships as possible and make your way back home.<br/><br/>If you do engage with the Convoy, follow the Sequence of Play thereafter until the Convoy gets away or you decide to let them go yourself, or you get sunk by an Escort : )<br/><br/>A Successful patrol is achieved when you make your way back home with 30+ tons of sunken ships.<br/><br/>I hope this is helpful to get the game to the table faster and expedite the beginning of your career as a U-BOOT Kommandant.<br/><br/>One more thing...enjoy the game!<br/><br/>BattleReady Wargames signing off.<br/><br/>ps: please leave a review on the bgg website (link below) so the game can get ranked. ?

Weather is Day/Good and rolled an 8 for Convoy placement (medium range - bottom dot. ), U-Boot at the Approach. I decide to engage with them.<br/><br/>Round 1<br/><br/>1- I decide to stay surfaced and move up 2 black dots which places me at the top dot in the close range.<br/><br/>2- ASW phase - nothing happens.<br/><br/>3 - Convoy moves up to the top dot in the Medium range.<br/><br/>4 - I decide to use 4 torpedoes. I have a +1 range DRM (I'm at the close range and Convoy is at the Medium range - only 1 range away)<br/><br/>My to hit number now is 4 + 1 DRM for a total of 5 or above. I shoot all 4 for 5,4,2,6. 2 hits, not bad at all. Now I must roll to see if they actually explode on impact. 1s are duds and everything else is an explosion. I roll 2,2 - phew that was close.<br/><br/>Now I roll for tonnage on the bottom of the page. 8 tons total, pretty good score so far.<br/><br/>5 - Damage control - nothing happens. No injuries and no damage to the boat yet.<br/><br/>Round 2<br/><br/>- I stay surfaced and move up 2 dots to the top dot of the Medium range. During Day/good per rules I'm automatically found.<br/><br/>-ASW - Escort moves down the escort track now. He is coming for me.<br/><br/>- Convoy moves up to the Long range dot.<br/><br/>- Since I'm reloading all of my torpedoes this turn I can't fire them yet. I decide to use my deck gun against the lonely ship.<br/><br/>I roll 2d6 to a base hit of 4 + 1 DRM range. (U-boot at Medium range and Convoy at the Long range) for a total of 5 or above to hit. I roll 3 and 4. Not great.<br/><br/>- Damage control phase - nothing happens.<br/><br/>to be continued.<br/><br/>",

Slipshod facts, suspicious events, cyphers and charades are the things that will help shed light on these mysteries and help unravel the most complex cases.<br/><br/>More than 100 unique locations await you during the game. Among them, for example, the Chicago Tribune, the Boeing Aircraft Company's test centre, Imperial Restaurant, the University of Chicago, and the small town of Dixon, just a couple of hours away from Chicago.<br/><br/>Once Upon a Time in Chicago: 1930 is a development of Once Upon a Time in Chicago, but you don't have to go through the first game to play the new one.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "First off, I should point out that &quot;meatgrinder&quot; is being used in professional literature about the battle.  An example is the 18th April 2023 article &quot;How Long Should Ukrainian Forces Defend Bakhmut? Lessons from Stalingrad,&quot; by G&aelig;lan Hanlon on West Point's Modern War Institute website.<br/><br/>This seemingly conventional hex-and-counter combat-odds-resolution game is both operational and (intra-city) more tactical with different scaled maps for each.  Unit level is battalion to brigade.  No airpower which has been neutralized in the war but artillery including HIMARS and Russian long-distance glide bombs are present, and there is fortification - albeit flank-able - to mitigate those.<br/><br/>But the added dimension of the game is the expertise levels of the units, their promotion and/or reinforcement/replacement, and the (tragic) human - ergo political - loss factor which can disrupt or even conceivably halt the fighting and the game - a deliverance reversal of the &quot;sudden death&quot; game mechanic, if you will.<br/><br/>There are promote-able conscript and then/also regular army units for both sides.  On the Ukraine side there are the hardcore political Azovs and also, starting in 2023, NATO-trained units of initially unpredictable strength.  On the Russian side, there are promote-able &quot;cost-free&quot; convict/prisoner units and the mercenary Wagners.<br/><br/>Units are hidden until attacking or attacked.<br/><br/>The game could have as many as 6 players: on each side a northern operational player outside the city, the city battle commander, and the southern &quot;outside&quot; operational player, but there will have to be some authority established as to who gets reinforcements/replacements and artillery ammunition use or stockpiling.<br/><br/>The game has relatively simple combat mechanics (albeit having a wave-attack opportunity) and lasts 16 half month turns from the start of October 2022 until the battle's &quot;historical&quot; end ... right now (May 2023).<br/><br/>&quot;Whether the Ukrainians choose to keep it going after having lost the city is ... right now ... problematic.  Hopefully, it will have convinced everyone of the intolerable human cost and futility of continuing the war.&quot;<br/><br/>Well, the Ukrainians *have* chosen to resume the battle as part of their offensive and have pushed the Russians back significantly on the northern and southern flanks, so I have added a Continuation Battle of 10 more turns on the Turn Record Track with a suggested order of battle/setup.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The young have no conception of what life was like during the war against the Dark Lord, and they are far better for it. However, this peace balances unsteadily on a knife&rsquo;s edge. The shadow of evil grows tall and long. Rumors of dragons come from the far reaches. Goblins organize into roving bands. The dead stir in the dust of long-forgotten battlefields. The scent of sulfur and brimstone permeates the air to the south, bringing with it a dread promise of demons.<br/><br/>Ancient tomes in the libraries of Monarch City tell us one thing: the shattering of our peace is upon us.<br/><br/>Defenders of the Realm: Legends Edition is a fresh take on the co-operative fantasy classic. Be the heroes who adventure together across the land to destroy the forces of darkness. The game features six unique heroes, each with a unique deck as well as variable player powers.

In the game, players start with a map of stations already built and must balance the desire to upgrade their engines, and fulfill bespoke delivery contracts, with the need to quickly build a flexible train network that can transport goods to a range of destinations.<br/><br/>The String Railway Collection packs both of these standalone games into a single small-box package and features vibrant updated artwork, improved graphic design, and a refined ruleset.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

This requires the use of memory, strategy and powers of deduction along the way.<br/><br/>The goal of each round is to collect the 7 colours of the rainbow. Players work hard to collect and protect their hand but other players can use a number of special cards to stop, steal or swap cards that can totally obliterate a hand and ruin any chances of winning.<br/><br/>Players can work with or against each other to be the first to collect 1 card of each colour whilst avoiding being left with any cards that count against your overall score.<br/><br/>After a player wins a round, other players add up the cards in their hand and when they reach 120 points overall that player is out of the game (alternative endings are also included).<br/><br/>Players are dealt 7 cards each and then take it in turns to draw and discard cards taking any appropriate action, this is where the fun (or not so much fun) begins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

On 17 September, Villars is informed that Styrum&rsquo;s army is marching on H&ouml;chst&auml;dt, ready to establish a bridge at Grenheim to launch a combined attack against the French Army at Nodendorf on the other bank of the Danube.<br/>Ordering the army to march due north, Villars asks d&rsquo;Usson&rsquo;s corps of 7000 men stationed at  Dillingen to be ready at H&ouml;chst&auml;dt on the morning of the 20th. In the early morning hours of the 20th the Franco-Bavarian army crosses the Danube at Donauw&ouml;rth, and then marches toward the Austrian army.<br/>The vanguard meets Prussian troops who return to Styrum. Styrum decides to move out toward the north and better defensive positions. The train begins its movement toward N&ouml;rdlingen. Due to a quiproquo, d&rsquo;Usson is supposed to attack the Austro-Prussian army from the other side and launches his attack around 08.00. The Austrians are sure this is the principal offensive and change their plan and march on Oberglauheim. One against three, the French troops hold out while Villars is only three hours away by foot&hellip;<br/>In October 1703, Marshal Tallard besieges Landau to recapture it from imperial hands. Marlborough&rsquo;s allied army of Flanders sends a corps commanded by the Prince of Hessen-Kassel to lend assistance to the troops of the Count of Nassau-Weilburg.<br/>On 13 November, the latter&rsquo;s troops cross the Rhine and join forces with the Prince.  The troops camp between Heilingenstein and Dudenhofen in front of Spire (Speyer). The attack against the French forces besieging Landau is planned for the 16th.<br/>Tallard has requested Pracontal&rsquo;s help since the 10th. The latter being in Lorraine, the Imperials are sure that he will never arrive in time.<br/>On the evening of the 14th, Tallard leaves Landau, and 6000 men, and marches toward Spires.<br/>In the morning of the 15th, he reaches Pracontal at the appointed time and, now with 18 000 men, prepares to face off against 20 000 men from the imperial army.<br/>At 13.00 the French Army in battle order engages the combat against the enemy&rsquo;s left wing which is only barely deployed and is disorganised!<br/> The game proposes two scenarios for each of the battles.<br/><br/>",

As such, some pitches are smaller than standard Blood Bowl regulations dictate, designed specifically for use when playing games of Sevens.<br/><br/>This simplified version of the game is ideal for younger players, busy coaches, or anyone looking to get into the game with a shallower learning curve.<br/><br/>This reversible Blood Bowl pitch features a standard turf field on one side and astrogranite tiles on the reverse. Though the size is reduced, all the standard markings are present and accounted for.<br/><br/>You'll also find a pair of matching double-sided dugouts to complete the theme. Redesigned for games of Sevens, each dugout features a shorter Score, Turn, and Re-roll tracker, plus Reserves, Knocked-out, and Casualty boxes. You'll need a copy of both Blood Bowl &ndash; The Official Rules and the Blood Bowl: Second Season Edition – Death Zone supplement to use this pitch.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

If you are not familiar with Kaiju, we encourage you to watch the latest DVDs produced by Toho company or Daiei (available in subtitled or dubbed editions). Both the Godzilla and the Gamera film series represent the state of the art in this specific genre. Some interesting variations are also coming out of Korea and other Asian countries.<br/><br/>In the game, every player controls one or more monsters fighting against each other and turning the world to rubble. The background is our own world, as it exists today or, if you prefer a retro feel, as it was in the classic Japanese monster movies of the seventies. The only important difference is that giant monsters, much bigger than the largest dinosaur, populate the Earth. Some of them are benevolent earth guardians, protecting the planet from mankind&rsquo;s folly and invaders from outer space, others are unstoppable forces of nature bent on global destruction.

Also included is Kurita history, from Shiro Kurita's bloody conquests while forging the Draconis Combine to Takashi Kurita's ruthless &quot;justice.&quot; Every Combine 'Mech regiment from Rasalhague to Luthien is listed, along with the totalitarian government's structure, a description of the ISF (the Coordinator's secret police), and excerpts from the Dictum Honorium, which spells out the codes of conduct for Kurita citizens.<br/><br/>Threatening to devour both the Federated Suns and the Lyran Commonwealth, the Dragon grows stronger and more fearsome. Every year brings the Draconis Combine closer to fulfilling its destiny of conquering the Inner Sphere.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beyond a Cheese strategy game!<br/><br/>Located at the heart of Minas Gerais state, Serra da Canastra is a certified region where one of the most traditional raw milk cheese has been produced since colonial times. <br/>Canastra&acute;s cheese is a hidden treasure little known outside Brazil. <br/>Until very recently, it&acute;s only been made by a few exclusive and certified producers. Now it is time for you to make a change in this game.<br/><br/>Your challenge is to make your small company grow and become the best among all cheesemongers, admired and certified with loads of Prestige Points.<br/><br/>Players must produce, pick up, deliver, and hopefully guide as many Tourists they can to appreciate those great cheese and other typical products such as coffee, P&atilde;o de Queijo and Dulce de Leche.<br/><br/>And remember, there is always someone else ready to profit from your cheese!<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t=============Canastra is a competitive open information strategy game for 2 to 5 businessmen.<br/><br/>The game is played in four rounds. <br/>Every round has 3 phases: a) income; b) Actions; and c) Quality level.<br/><br/>A) Income of Action Cubes<br/>Built Farms on the board produce a milk token and a typical product cube.<br/>Players always get 7 Action Cubes and may get plus cubes, up to 4 units, for each Farm Bonus tile with a milk token they have.<br/><br/>B) Following turn order, players use their Action Cubes to take only one action per turn, until everyone has passed.<br/>Some actions spend more Action Cubes than others. The action of producing cheese may not spend action cubes at all if a player has all the necessary ingredients.<br/><br/>There are eight Actions available: Produce Cheese, Pickup items, Deliver items, Guide Tourists, Build a Farm, Movement, Draw an Online Request Card, and Pass.<br/><br/>C) Raise the Quality Level of one Region<br/>A Specialist meeple is placed on the Region that has produced more cheese according to the production track. <br/>The player with more influence, counting Crafter meeples, the Truck, Cheese packages, and Farms, receive Prestige Points and a Quality Certificate tile that give endgame prestige points. <br/>The Region increases its Quality value. This has impact on the price of Cheese when picked up, and also values all the Farms on that same Region.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t=============<br/> <br/>There is not a money representation on this game. No coins. <br/>All the commercial transactions give players Prestige Points.<br/>The way Prestige Points are gained during the game is very  intertwined with players actions.<br/><br/>------------------------- <br/>Replayability of Canastra focus on the setup of the board, on several different Farm bonus tiles available, where each player may build up to four Farms, the various ways of getting Prestige Points, and also the interaction among players during the game.<br/><br/>",

The objective is to be the first to reach 100 points, which players earn by depositing Payload Tokens at &ldquo;worlds&rdquo; (in fact, the real planets, dwarf planets, moons, moonlets, asteroids, and comets of our Solar System) hidden randomly underneath the 150 circular tiles which form the playing surface. In addition to these worlds are also &ldquo;empty space&rdquo; tiles featuring images from the Hubble Space Telescope and &ldquo;hazard&rdquo; tiles which pose danger to passing spacecraft.<br/><br/>Each round players receive an income of 2 telescope tokens plus 4 tokens in a combination of their choice: telescopes, fuel, or payload. Telescope tokens allow players to sneak a peek at the identities of tiles before anyone else. Fuel tokens enable spacecraft to launch, move around the playing surface, and land. Payload tokens allow players to earn points, and can be used to displace other players from their spots on worlds.<br/><br/>By managing income efficiently and making wise choices about where to deploy their fleet, players accumulate points and move their score markers along a track. The first to reach 100 points wins!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Every 5 points that you obtain you get to roll an extra dice (starting with one, max of 5). If anyone, including you, ever rolls your number two times or more you get to choose a mice or rat card. Mice cards help you, Rat cards hurt other players (i.e. Fat Rat- Roll 1 less die).

The French forces are small, but nimble, pitted against their larger opponent. As at Grossbeeren, the Allied army's initial deployment is its greatest weakness &ndash; if the French can move quickly they can over-whelm the Prussians and occupy the Juterbog objective before the rest of the Allied army can be brought to bear. But can the French keep Ney in command of an army rather than personally leading a charge?<br/><br/>NOTE, Dennewitz 20 is not a &lsquo;stand alone&rsquo; game.

Created to captivate children in an era of increasingly short attention spans, the TorahLine game provides engaging gameplay to help kids absorb stories, facts, and the chronology of the Torah.  The first game in the TorahLine series, Exodus from Egypt &ndash; Shemos, Va&rsquo;eira and Bo, depicts the riveting events from the book of Exodus.<br/><br/>Packed with 90 colorful cards and providing hours of fun for ages six and up, TorahLine: Exodus from Egypt covers the events in the first three Torah portions from the enslavement in Egypt to the 10 plagues to the first Passover to the eventual freedom from Egypt.<br/><br/>The front of each card has an event title, a hand-drawn illustration, and verse text. The back includes the Torah portion and chapter and verse numbers. At the start of the game, players are dealt starting events on which to build their line of cards in sequence. Players then take turns drawing cards from the pile and correctly (or incorrectly) placing them in line in order by chapter and verse. After all the cards are gone, the player with the most correct cards in his or her line wins.<br/><br/>The game makes it easy to adjust the difficulty for each player, making it ideal for older children and families. It also comes with a bonus trivia game that can be played in the car or at the dinner table.<br/><br/>",

The game is named for its use of text-based visuals inspired by the 1967 ASCII character encoding standard.<br/><br/>The gameplay can be described as &ldquo;roll-and-write&rdquo;. Each civilization's progress in various fields and their production and use of resources are marked on a piece of paper, the Empire sheet. Each turn begins with rolling of five dice. During a brief round of diplomacy, some dice may be rerolled; the players then proceed to use the results to mark their sheets. When any of several possible game end conditions is triggered, points are calculated and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Then strange things began to happen at the main house.<br/><br/>Rest in Peace is a haunted house card game. Solitaire. It consists of 29 Print-n-Play cards to be used in conjunction with an ordinary deck of 52 playing cards.<br/><br/>There are 13 rooms in this haunted house. You will draw cards from an ordinary deck of playing cards to move from room to room. Each card&rsquo;s numeric value (rank) corresponds to one of the rooms. There are 13 secrets. The secrets are shuffled and dealt alongside each room. By visiting a room you can reveal its secret. There are 3 clues: skull, hourglass, cross. The 3 clues are shuffled to form a &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; (for example: cross-skull-hourglass). The pattern will be revealed as you play the game and flip the clues face up. You are looking for this pattern in the rooms. If you find it and return to the Main Entrance, you win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is a blend of operational/tactical level combat and maneuver during the retaking of the islands of Saipan and Tinian from the Japanese during the Second World War. The game is played in turns, each one divided into phases for amphibious landing, maneuver, and combat. The game system uses many of the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) to simulate actual combat and maneuver that both the US and Japanese players must use to fight the battle. Of the seven BOS's, this simulation concentrates on Maneuver, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Air Defense, and Command and Control. The Japanese defenses are sophisticated and well manned with fanatical soldiers willing to die for their emperor. They fight so hard in fact that an army general is sacked because of the toughness of the Japanese defenses.  The fight is bloody and sharp. Victory in the game is measured against the time and casualties it took the US forces to actually accomplish the same mission.<br/><br/>The game features US Marine Corps, US Army, US Navy, and Imperial Japanese forces at the Battalion, Company, and Platoon level. Units are initially setup as Battalions and Companies, and can be broken down into their respective elements. The combat system utilizes a set of combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. The Japanese player has the ability to conduct Banzai attacks at night and these cause considerable damage as the US player cannot fall back in front of these attacks and must take casualties.<br/><br/>The are a number of scenarios that simulate the The Recapture of Saipan, The Recapture of Tinian, Death Valley, and possibly others.  There will be numerous options that can be used to even play between players and make the fight more interesting.  These include additional Japanese forces that could have been there if they were not sunk by US submarines, and having more artillery available for the main battle in lieu of having shore batteries.<br/><br/>Key Features<br/>                <br/>4 11&quot;x17&quot; game maps of Saipan and Tinian<br/>BOS representations (level of fidelity)<br/>    Maneuver (Medium)<br/>    Fire Support (Medium)<br/>    Air Defense (Low)<br/>    Mobility and Survivability (Medium)<br/>    Combat Service Support (Low)<br/>    Intelligence (Low)<br/>    Command and Control (Medium)<br/>Approximately 900 unit counters and markers<br/>Unit breakdowns (virtually all of them)<br/>Easy to learn and play<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Commands &amp; Colors: Napoleonics game system allows players to effectively portray Napoleonic Grande size battles, as well as smaller historical actions. The scale of the game is flexible and varies from battle to battle. In some scenarios, a unit may represent an entire division, while in others, a unit may represent a single regiment or battalion. During play, the Command cards drive movement, while creating a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo;, and the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. The stylized battlefield maps emphasize the important terrain features and highlight the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. Finally, the Napoleonic tactics you will need to execute to gain victory conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various Napoleonic national armies of the day and the actual battlefield terrain features on which they fought.<br/><br/>La Grande Battles Napoleonics is the seventh expansion for GMT&rsquo;s Commands &amp; Colors: Napoleonics game system. The expansion features as many as 10 La Grande Battle scenarios, 10 EPIC engagements, and a number of standard-sized battles. The La Grande Battles battlefield is a whopping 11 hexes deep by 26 hexes wide, and there are two La Grande Battles mounted map boards (left and right) included in the expansion. The EPIC battlefield is 11 hexes deep by 20 hexes wide, which is almost double the size of the standard scenario battlefield of 9 hexes deep by 13 hexes wide. Two EPIC battlefield map sheets (left and right) are also included.<br/><br/>Special Bonus: There are two La Grande Battle extended size scenarios on a double-sided preprinted paper map, Waterloo 18 June 1815 and Borodino 7 September 1812. These two battles are 11 hexes deep by 29 hexes wide and because the battlefield is already printed with all the terrain and unit deployments, the time it takes to set up these battles is minimal.<br/> Players will find a number of new units, including Polish French allies, British highlanders, KGL infantry and cavalry, plus all the unit blocks and rules needed when fielding these units in a battle.<br/><br/>The expansion also includes a number of Leader of Honor blocks. Leader of Honor blocks have a portrait of the Napoleonic leader and were first mentioned in the Generals, Marshals &amp; Tacticians expansion #5. A Leader of Honor orders more units when a &ldquo;Take Command&rdquo; Command card is played. Please note, the number of Leader of Honor blocks for the various Napoleonic nations will vary and are determined in scale with each Napoleonic Army&rsquo;s field commander status history.<br/> This expansion also presents new rules for Iconic Commanders that are recommended for all EPIC and La Grande Battle scenarios. For example: When Napoleon is in command, because of his excellent grasp and flow of a battle, after the play of a Scout Command card, the French player, when drawing two new Command cards, can keep both cards and discard one Command card from his hand. When Wellington is in command, because of his keen eye for terrain, the British player prior to the battle may redeploy up to 4 hexes of units. For example: One unit could redeploy up to 4 hexes or two units 2 hexes each or four units 1 hex each, etc. Other Napoleonic nations also have their own unique Iconic Commander rules.<br/><br/>Knowing that it is not always easy to muster eight players, you will find that a scenario of EPIC Napoleonics will play out very well with just two players. It is highly recommended players give the EPIC scenarios a try, playing one on one. While a La Grande Battle game is best played with eight players (four players taking command on each side). The La Grande Battles rules found in this expansion, however, have be slightly modified from the La Grande Battles rules originally presented in EPIC Napoleonics expansion #6. Basically, we found after playing through these larger battle scenarios a number of times, that the updated rules will allow each player to be more involved and have greater control during the entire battle.<br/><br/> <br/>To experience the maximum enjoyment with these two Napoleonic game formats, both EPIC and La Grande Battle scenarios are best played using the Command card and Tactician card decks that were part of the Generals, Marshals &amp; Tacticians expansion.<br/> It is important to also note in order to play most EPIC Napoleonics scenarios, players will need a copy of the Commands &amp; Colors: Napoleonic core game and many of its expansions (Spanish Army, Russian Army, Austrian Army, Prussian Army, Generals, Marshals &amp; Tacticians, EPIC Napoleonics and La Grande Battles).<br/><br/>Again as I stated previously in the EPIC Napoleonics expansion, it is not the intention of GMT or myself, to require a player to buy multiple copies of the Napoleonic game to play a La Grande Battle scenario. I would truly hope, that two friends, both who own copies of the Napoleonic game and expansions could come together with their games, set up a La Grande Battles scenario and share in the fun with six more of their friends.<br/> Although the scope and scale of our Commands &amp; Colors Napoleonic game has increased two fold again, the basic rules of play for the most part, have remained the same.

Each dice can be spent to perform an action like attacking, resting, furthering your objective or performing one of the special actions on a hero card. The value of the dice represents the speed and power of the action. Low rolls can be spent on fast, weak actions. Higher rolls can be spent on slower, more powerful actions.<br/><br/>The game is won when all the objectives on the mission card have been completed. The game is lost when all three heroes are incapacitated or you run out of time.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

But, a critical ritual was disrupted by a group of survivors, and Grin himself is now part zombie. And he loves it. Being a half zombie didn&rsquo;t slow Grin down at all. In fact, the twisted experiment made him faster than any necromancer. And so he dashes through the villages, spreading chaos wherever he goes, always with that maniacal rotting grin on his face!<br/><br/>&ldquo;Necromancers get nightmares too.

He hardly rests, he barely eats, and he speaks of nothing except the most expeditious paths to victory against the undead hordes. To him, killing zombies only addresses the symptom. To truly stem the tide, the necromancers themselves must be destroyed. A favorite strategy is to track these fiends to their lairs and sanctums. Though these are often filled with minions, traps, and other horrors, Scowl points out that the necromancers are also trapped in there with him, a nightmare scenario for any cabal.<br/><br/>",

Combat is fast and furious and there (again depending on which of the many games you choose to play) are even supply issues to deal with while you shoot, bomb, and shell your adversaries.<br/><br/>",

There are 24 available points, 12 from the available tricks and 12 from available points.<br/><br/>Bidding goes around the table once where the players bid for the two card blind.  High bid takes the blind and decides which suit (fraction set) will be trump.<br/><br/>Like in many trick taking games, and if you make your hand, you get the points.  If you do not, you are set, hence the name (as they say in the rules) Some &quot;r&quot; set.<br/><br/>See also:<br/>Some'R'Set - 28 card version<br/><br/>",

The fifth player will play as the Psionic Prisoner, whose goal and ability are just as unique as the other characters':  The Psionic Prisoner merely must escape the dungeon through one of the four exits.  The challenge is that the way the Psionic Prisoner deals with monsters is by retreating from them, and when he is in the game, he starts in the middle space, with monsters guaranteed in the surrounding four spaces.  So, he can't move until another character liberates him.  Fortunately, the Psionic Prisoner has the option to rotate any revealed room 90&deg;, rather than move or dig.<br/><br/>Because the Psionic prisoner is one more character the Healer must heal, this expansion includes a white disc.

Across one-off games or a linked campaign, your squad will grow in number and experience, earning special abilities and new equipment.<br/><br/>Deadzone is played on an interactive 3D gaming board built using the innovative hard plastic Battlezones Terrain Tiles. These tiles are fully modular, simply use the connectors and click the pieces together. No glue required.<br/><br/><br/>New Faction: Veer-myn<br/>Veer-myn are a new faction in Deadzone, and this is the first time we are creating miniatures for them in hard plastic.<br/><br/>An insidious disease ridden race, the Veer-Myn fester in the darkest corners of man&rsquo;s world. Their broods writhe and chatter in a rodent like manner, equally matched by their physical appearance. The uncertainty of whether the Veer-Myn act with a motive, or just the need to infest and expand, only adds to the nightmare created from what lurks within the shadows.<br/><br/><br/>New Miniatures: Enforcer Pathfinders<br/>New in hard plastic, the Enforcer range gets a boost with these deadly scouts.<br/><br/>Even amongst the ranks of the Enforcers, the Pathfinders are an elite and highly specialised group. Their role demands that they avoid direct contact with the enemy wherever possible and their standard equipment and weaponry reflect this. Deployed ahead of the main force, the Pathfinders are tasked with gathering all the necessary Intel required to support a successful campaign, while eliminating any obstacles that may hinder the deployment of the main Enforcer vanguard.<br/><br/><br/>New Scenery: Industrial Scenery<br/><br/>An innovative range of modular Battlezones terrain tiles. The tiles clip together using special connectors. These tiles expand the range with new Industrial scenery, giving you a new style of tiles to play with<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Getting Started: we want gamers everywhere to be playing Deadzone. The new Rulebook will be streamlined and reordered to make getting started simple, whilst incorporating the abilities and skills from the original expansion for easy reference.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    New Force Organisation: We are implementing a new Force Organisation Chart to make building your strike team easy, and helping make your next purchase that little bit simpler. More information on this during the campaign!<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Deep Campaign Setting: one of the original's shortcomings was the campaign section, and we'll tackling this with a new exciting system in the updated book after incorporating feedback from playtest groups and the community at large.<br/><br/><br/>All existing miniatures are fully compatible with this new rulebook.<br/><br/>",

You command platoons of soldiers and armour across the Western Front landscape. You will encounter enemies, obstacles, good fortune and crippling bad luck at every turn as you try to reach your objective.<br/><br/>During a game you will command both infantry, tanks, support weapons and with the aid of artillery and air strikes progress across one (or more) of the maps on a chosen scenario. You will face stiff, defiant opposition in the enemy forces who are not going to give ground easily. You will need to make hard, tough choices weighing up options with the information you have and attempting to account for the unknown.<br/><br/>There are random event / enemy forces activity tables that you consult, after your roll your dice (2d6). You also roll 2d6 to receive Command Points each turn, that you can use to move, attack enemy forces in your areas, attempt reconnoiter into new areas, call for air &amp; artillery support to help your units, and rally your units that have been suppressed in combat.<br/><br/>The game is quick to setup and play, it takes around 30 minutes to play a shorter game, to less than a couple of hours for a larger game and requires very little space.<br/><br/>You will be commanding either Allied or Axis forces of infantry and tanks against their enemies in a series of  narrative driven scenarios and campaign linking the scenarios together.<br/><br/>This is a solitaire game, and the 2d6 dice rolls and respective event and action tables will drive the direction and flow of the game.<br/><br/>Which road will _you_ chose?<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to contribute as much as possible to building a city. Along the way, you'll discover new species, build domes and solar panels and face sabotage, tornadoes and repeated power outages.<br/><br/>In Exoplanet, players try to score victory points by exploring the planet with their team and delivering metal tokens to the city tile. This requires energy, which you can get from energy bricks or generate with solar panels. Humans can reproduce by building domes that they can live in. Drawing action cards can provide additional benefits and allow you to stay ahead of the competition. You can also use them to discover new species, which give you extra victory points. Each building gives you more victory points. Once all available spaces on the city tile are occupied, the game ends immediately. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>In your turn, you have access to 5 action points, which you can use in different ways. For example, you can move your scouts, who may discover new terrain or pick up building materials. You can also choose to research the value of metal tokens or draw action cards. After spending your action points, you may build if you meet its conditions. Finally, you collect energy with scouts at solar panels. That energy is needed to deliver metal tokens to the central tile, with which you can eventually earn the most points and win the game!<br/><br/>",

If one is looking for a variety of unit types, tactical doctrine, or weaponry, medieval/renaissance warfare has much to offer.  If one wants colorful dress and dramatic costumes, then the Landtsknecht and the Ottoman Janissaries are but a few of the many available troops.   Even more appealing is that this is a period of fascinating transitions in the practice of warfare.<br/><br/>Two of the greatest transitional effects are the introduction and growing effectiveness of gunpowder weapons, both in the form of artillery, as well as personal weapons, and the ability for nations to field semi-national armies.  The creation of these larger forces and their supply was a necessary social foundation for the Military Revolution that allowed the great armies of the 17th century and later.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Piquet: Master Rules for Wargaming<br/><br/><br/>",

Also a roll of 1-2, once played, is followed by a second move for that player.  Mindgammon has also taken elements of Old English Backgammon in that you are limited to 6 men per point.<br/><br/>The classic board is now laid out in a single column, making the game visually easier for beginners.  Bearing-off is by exact count only.  Also there are penalties for &quot;unsportsmanlike&quot; rolling of the dice, either out-of-turn or out-of-bounds.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the book:<br/><br/>For Adept Jeremiah Rose, ComStar's stunning victory on Tukayyid was a crushing personal defeat. After losing his 'Mech and his command to the Clans, Rose resigned his commission with the Com Guards and returned home to seek a place with his family among the famed Northwind Highlanders. When the Highlanders rejected him, Rose refused to give up. He set out for Solaris VII, where he gained a new BattleMech, new comrades, and a renewed sense of purpose. Thus the Black Thorns were born...<br/><br/>Recreate the exciting adventures of Jeremiah Rose and his Black Thorns in this scenario pack for BattleTech. Based on the events of the novels Main Event and D.R.T., this book includes a history of the Black Thorns, as well as MechWarrior game statistics for the main characters of this elite mercenary unit.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>The Black Thorns never played a particularly large part in the game canon for the BattleTech universe, and are mostly detailed in a series of novels. This scenario pack contains 15 or so assorted scenarios that allow players to replay major and minor battles from the Black Thorns novels, and also adds four new 'Mechs to the BattleTech game; 3 Clan 'Mechs and 1 ComStar 'Mech. The 'Mechs were reprinted in the BattleTech Technical Readout: 3058 a year later, so if you already have that expansion and aren't interested in the Black Thorns, there's not much reason to get this sourcebook. On the other hand, if you're a big fan of the unit itself, then this is probably a must-have expansion, so you'll be happy to hear that the current licence holder has it available as an electronic book.<br/><br/>",

As well as a host of new companies to fight or, bring on, the darkness that threatens to engulf the Old World.<br/><br/>You will meet old enemies such as Vlad Tepes, Prince of Wallachia, and his nemesis Abraham van Helsing. Play the brave men of the Imperial Nightwatch as they test their modern might against the terrifying vampire minions of the immortal Countess Bathory. Rouse the Village mob to drive out Baron Viktor von Frankenstein and his abominations. Tread the corridors of power as a member of the Illuminati or, join the Gypsies to hunt Werewolves under the full moon. Witness Sampson Caine and the Nuns of the Order of the Bringer of Salvation defend the innocent from the predations of the Dread Monks of Sucevita. Unleash the Unborn upon the terrible White Slavers. You can also upgrade and test your existing IHMN companies against these many terrors.<br/><br/>New scenarios and landscapes will take your companies into dark forests, mist shrouded castles, ancient ruins, pagan altars and grim, fortified villages the length and breadth of Transylvania, Wallachia and the ever-forbidding Carpathian Mountains.<br/><br/>This is classic Victorian Gothic Horror at its grisly, horripilating best. It is not recommended for ladies and gentlemen of a nervous disposition, for the darkness will feed upon their terror.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Note: Gothic is not a stand alone game, and you will need a copy of In Her Majesty&rsquo;s Name from Osprey publishing in order to play.<br/><br/>",

Heroes must cooperate to accomplish the mission and get more Achievement Points than the Dark Player, but only one of them will win: the hero with the most Achievement Points (including the secret ones!). This fully new game mode includes a deck of cards where players will find more than 60 different events that will affect them or that may be used to affect their companions at key moments (you can trip a mate while he's running away from a powerful enemy, push him into the bottom of a pit, poison the water in a fountain just before an ally drinks from it, loot the contents of a chest while no one is looking, announce that you are an infiltrated enemy when you deem the time is right...).<br/><br/>Use: 3-6 players. Ideal for playing independent adventures. This great game mode will make your games hilarious and full of mistrust towards your mates. It can be played in the cooperative mode (with the Artificial Intelligence) or with a human Dark Player.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game can be played solo (against an enemy AI), coop or head to head. Play with miniatures or paper counters.<br/><br/>The core of Nuts! Final Version is its unique reaction system making combat dynamic and unpredictable. Each soldier may react differently under fire including the enemy units. There are hidden enemies called Possible Enemy Forces. You&rsquo;ll never know where, when, how many or what type of enemy will pop up on the board to meet your squad. Is it just your nerves or is it a tank?<br/><br/>Nuts! Final Version streamlines many of the mechanics from its previous version. There are rules for a campaign.

        "description": "&quot;At the heart of the Royal Blue Sea, a position in the Council of the Great City of Menhos, political and economic capital of the Kelonic archipelago is now vacant. The leaders of the smaller islands eagerly seek to obtain that seat by gaining more influence through commerce and production.<br/>    Trof&iacute;, the island of fishing and agriculture; Eide, the land of great sawmills; Calkino the island of bronze foundries; Latomeia, the quarry of the high seas; and Kras&iacute;, producers of the best grapes; all of them try to gain their place among the families that rule the Council, the capital&rsquo;s founding families of a long tradition of master craftsmen. In their efforts, the emissaries of these islands can take the advantage of the founding families&rsquo; favour they obtain when gaining influence in the city or in exchange for a price.&quot;<br/>    &quot;Emporous&quot; tells a story in two chapters, the second one being a more complex option for players who enjoy bluffing and negotiating in a more intense way. We advice to play the First Chapter before proceeding with the Second one, but that's not mandatory.<br/>    In &quot;Emporous&quot; you are the sailing emissary of an island -called  &quot;Emporous&quot;- dedicated to raw material production, islands that compete to have the most economic influence in the Capital city, Menhos. As such, you must find the fastest way to acquire influence points by fulfilling contracts, commissioning artisan works and gaining Masteries. The First Chapter of our Story, &quot;Kelonic Islands&quot;, is about these struggles.<br/>    The game develops in a series of turns, in which you'll have to make a Trip, choosing whether to &quot;Travel to your Island&quot; to recover all your spent coins and bring back some raw materials your island produces; or to &quot;Travel to the city&quot; to perform one action, such as using your available resources to acquire different ones, to commission artisan works or fulfill your contracts. On the other hand, you can complete your objetives faster if you have the Council&rsquo;s Seal, which grants you access to the benefits of having the founding families&rsquo; favour, Seal which you can obtain by gaining influence in the city or by giving the Council one of your coins.<br/>    The Second Chapter of our Story, &quot;The Council of Menhos&quot; tells the real reasons behind all the changes in the Council, in which our Emporous will get tangled in a more complicated web of relationships with the council and with each other. In this Chapter, you'll have to complete Clandestine Tasks acquired during the game before it's end, while trying to get influence as fast as possible. If you fail to fulfill one or more of these tasks, you'll lose influece for each one of them.<br/>    The graphic design in this game has been specificaly though of and developed for being accessible for people with a colour blindness condition, especially for protanopia and deuteranopia.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>&quot;En el coraz&oacute;n del mar Turqu&iacute;, uno de los asientos del Concejo de la Gran Ciudad de Menhos, capital pol&iacute;tica y econ&oacute;mica del archipi&eacute;lago Kelonico, ha quedado vacante. Los l&iacute;deres de las islas m&aacute;s peque&ntilde;as buscan &aacute;vidamente obtener ese esca&ntilde;o ganando influencia a trav&eacute;s del comercio y la producci&oacute;n.<br/>Trof&iacute;, la isla de la pesca y la agricultura; Eide, la tierra de los grandes aserraderos; Calkino la isla de las fundiciones de bronce; Latomeia, la cantera de altamar; y Kras&iacute;, productores de la mejor vid; todos intentan ganar un lugar entre las familias que dominan el Concejo, familias fundadoras de la capital y de una larga tradici&oacute;n de maestros artesanos. En sus esfuerzos, los emisarios de estas islas podr&aacute;n sacar ventaja de los favores de estas familias fundadoras que obtienen al ganar influencia en la ciudad o a cambio de un precio&quot;.<br/>    &quot;Emporous&quot; cuenta una historia en dos Cap&iacute;tulos, siendo el segundo una opci&oacute;n m&aacute;s compleja para jugadores que disfrutan el &quot;bluff&quot; y la negociaci&oacute;n un poco m&aacute;s intensa. Aconsejamos jugar el Primer Cap&iacute;tulo antes de proceder con el Segundo, aunque ello no es obligatorio.<br/>    En &quot;Emporous&quot; eres el emisario navegante -llamado &quot;Emporous&quot;- de una isla productora de materias primas del archipi&eacute;lago que compiten por obtener la mayor influencia econ&oacute;mica en la ciudad capital, Mehnos. Como tal, deber&aacute;s buscar la forma m&aacute;s r&aacute;pida de conseguir puntos de influencia a trav&eacute;s de contratos, artesan&iacute;as y maestr&iacute;as. El Primer Cap&iacute;tulo de nuestra historia, &quot;Las Islas Kel&oacute;nicas&quot;, se trata de estos esfuerzos.<br/>    El juego se realiza en una serie de turnos de jugador, en que deber&aacute;s realizar un Viaje, decidiendo entre Viajar a tu Isla a buscar tu producci&oacute;n y recuperar tus monedas, o Viajar a la Ciudad para realizar una acci&oacute;n como usar tus recursos disponibles para adquirir otros, encargar artesan&iacute;as y cumplir con tus contratos. Por otra parte, podr&aacute;s completar tus objetivos mucho m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido si cuentas con el Sello del Concejo que te permite acceder a los beneficios de contar con el favor de las familias influyentes de Menhos, Sello que obtienes cuando ganas influencia en la ciudad o pagando una de tus monedas a las familias fundadoras.<br/>    El Segundo Cap&iacute;tulo de nuestra historia, &quot;El Concejo de Menhos&quot;, cuenta las verdaderas razones tras los cambios en le Concejo, en el que nuestros Emporous se ver&aacute;n enredados en una red de relaciones m&aacute;s complicada tanto con el Concejo como con los dem&aacute;s jugadores. En este Cap&iacute;tulo deber&aacute;s completar Tareas Clandestinas adquiridas durante la partida antes de que &eacute;sta termine, mientras intentas conseguir la mayor cantidad de influencia lo m&aacute;s r&aacute;pido posible. Si no consigues completar una o m&aacute;s de estas Tareas, perder&aacute;s influencia por cada una de ellas.<br/>    El dise&ntilde;o gr&aacute;fico de este juego ha sido expresamente pensado y desarrollado para ser accesible para personas con daltonismo, especialmente protanop&iacute;a y deuteranop&iacute;a.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer (Spanish)<br/><br/>",

Explore the route and you will run into wild Rocos to battle and catch for yourself.  Train your Rocos and teach them new moves. Do you have what it takes to become a Roco Ranger?<br/><br/>Objective<br/>To win Roco Ranger, you must win battles against rangers and other players, to become the new champion.<br/><br/>Your Turn<br/>Before you start playing, you must choose a starter Roco. Roco Ranger consists of two distinct phases. The capture phase and the ranger phase. During the capture phase you first choose where you want to go on the map. You can go as far as you want but you can never go back. You may then choose to search for items, search for Rocos or rest. Dice randomly decide what you will find, however stronger Rocos can be found further down the route. If you search for a Roco you get to battle it. You can gain XP, to level up your own Roco or capture the wild Roco. The capture phase is all about building your team. Whoever reaches the end first gets first pick in the second phase. Rushing over the route can be a big advantage, however it might be a better strategy to take it slow and build a stronger team.<br/><br/>In the ranger phase you will fight strategic battles with your entire team of Rocos against opponent teams. Just like wild Rocos, rangers have an automated move sequence (this allows for solo play experience). However unlike battles with wild Rocos, you will now battle two vs two and can swap and replace Rocos until a all Rocos of a team are defeated. Victory will give you the title of champion!<br/><br/>",

No game will ever take place on the same board. Each player begins the game with six territories of their own color, and each territory begins with a random number of Obelix (between 1 and 6).<br/><br/>Attacking an enemy territory is as simple as rolling dice for as many Obelix as a player controls, with one catch - the winner takes the territory without a scratch while the opponent loses every Obelix on the card. Players attack and defend while reinforcing territories via the luck of the dice, and the first player to place all of their Obelix on the board takes the win.<br/><br/>",

There are three types of buildings: <br/>1.Public buildings: Guildhalls<br/> -When entering guildhalls, players gain 2 Strategy cards;To recruit characters and expand the faction; or Upgrade your cities.<br/>2.Resource buildings: Villages, Mines<br/> -Occupied villages produce soldiers for its owner&rsquo;s team.  <br/> -Occupied mines upgrade cities.<br/>3.Cities<br/> -Occupied cities produce soldiers and great amounts of Honor points.<br/>  Consequently, every leader seizes and jealously guards their cities.<br/><br/>Players may choose one of the three types of battle when entering a city occupied by an enemy<br/>1.They may start champion warfare. If the attacker wins, they take soldiers from the city. <br/>2.Players may start an honor fight. The winner gains Honor points as well as reduced soldiers for the opponent.<br/>3.Players may start a war of aggression. If the attacker wins, they may occupy it.<br/>Dice cards apply to all kinds of battle. Using Dice cards wisely is essential to winning the game!<br/><br/>Every Character card has its own unique skills. You can choose your own starting characters corresponding to your own strategy.<br/>Also, Strategy cards make the game more strategic and fun.<br/><br/>In order to win, players have to cooperate and make deals with each other to try gaining advantages without drawing too much attention to themselves or being in last place. Take the initiative to thrive, but step back when the situation is dangerous. These are the best parts of playing Calas!<br/><br/>",

It has recently enjoyed a surge in popularity, and continues to fascinate mathematicians and game theorists with its duality of simple, elegant gameplay coupled with mathematically significant complexities. Hex Strategy: Making the Right Connections is the first book to offer a comprehensive look at the game, ranging from its history and mathematical underpinnings to advanced playing techniques. This book focuses on strategy from the player's perspective, and provides sufficient knowledge to play the game at a high level. Annotated sample games, puzzles, and numerous examples of an algorithmic approach to the game are provided, and discussions of strategy are profusely illustrated. Abstract board game players, recreational mathematicians, or simply those who enjoy games and puzzles of all kinds will be intrigued by the many facets of Hex covered in this book.<br/><br/>",

A Halfling has the deftness and grace of an Ogre, the ball handling skills of an Orc, and the durability of a particularly sickly Skaven &ndash; and, despite these faults, an inexplicable desire to play Blood Bowl. Now, the Halflings are taking the field once more with a brand-new team expansion&hellip;<br/><br/>Of course, for Halfling coaches, it&rsquo;s not about being the best. It&rsquo;s about the love of the game. It&rsquo;s gritting your teeth as another star Lineman all but explodes from the tiniest of tackles. It&rsquo;s putting half a dozen players in the enemy end zone in the hope that one of them maybe, just maybe, manages to catch the ball. It&rsquo;s that one game in ten where despite everything, you manage to bring the game to a draw &ndash; or, Nuffle willing, a hard-fought win.<br/><br/>The new Halfling models capture the spirit of the team perfectly &ndash; while these guys might struggle to fit into their uniforms, or even keep a hold of the ball, there&rsquo;s no doubting the determination on their faces. Or is that hunger?<br/><br/>This plastic Blood Bowl team kit comes with everything you need to build 12 halfling players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The PNP version of the game revenue was converted to the &quot;Friends of Ludus&quot; campaign, which helped to keep Ludus Luderia open.<br/><br/>In the game, players are organizing Ludus shelves, helping to store all the games in the best possible way. Use strategy and luck to keep the games on the shelves, taking care that none of them are crushed by heavier games.<br/><br/>On each round, players draft dice, which define the category and format of the game that will be drawn on the shelf. The game ends when one of the players completes the fourth space on their shelf. Each game category has a different scoring condition and game diversity and filled spaces also grant victory points.<br/><br/>The game also features a solo mode, in which the player competes for an increasingly higher score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Charming family is an eclectic family that lives in a manor on top of the hill in the town of Banebridge somewhere in New England circa 1932.  They own the local mortuary as well as a mining company.  All they want to do is live in peace, take care of their ancestral home, run their businesses, and get along with the townsfolk.  The villagers of Banebridge, however, see it differently.  Many of them are firm of the opinion that at least some if not all of the &ldquo;Charming&rdquo; family are up to nefarious deeds and are, in fact, &ldquo;monsters&rdquo; of various sorts. To that end, they are constantly turning up evidence that implicates members of the family in foul play. Some villagers even start stalking individual members. Sometimes (well, a lot of the time really), the family members are forced to take action to deal with especially difficult villagers or incriminating evidence. Actions include Murder, Terrify, Beguile, Deceive, Extort, Bribe, Coerce, and many more. Of course, the family would NEVER take such actions if the villagers weren&rsquo;t constantly interfering.<br/><br/><br/>Gathering Gloom is a cooperative game for 1-4 monsters in which the players take on the role of a Witch, a Mad Scientist, a Vampire, a Werewolf, a Zombie, or a Ghost and work to resolve a series of crises at their mansion and businesses. Each character has one or more special abilities and some have vulnerabilities.  They use their own attributes as well as those of villagers they have beguiled into minions along with resources on their &ldquo;Misdeed&rdquo; cards to resolve 14-16 crises in order to win the game. Gloom gathers every turn based on events as well as from Evidence or Peril cards.  If the gloom reaches 50 or more before resolving all the crises, the players lose. Also, if the fear that the villagers have about anyone player reaches twelve or more, the family is exposed and the players lose.<br/>   <br/>The village has seven locations to visit along with three family locations on the board. There are many things to do on the map since each location has a unique action the player can take.  There are also alternate buildings that can be selected at setup to add variety to play.<br/><br/>On your turn, you roll dice to determine events. Then you can move to any location on the board, where you may activate an on-arrival action; you may use cards to perform other actions; you may resolve crises in family locations. Finally, you check to see if any villagers or stalkers are going to activate. You draw up for your next turn, and you are done.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

WW1 history meets dieselpunk fantasy in an alternate universe of fast-paced chibi battles and unorthodox invention.<br/><br/>Originally created by Ted Terranova, Rivet Wars: Reloaded is a reload of Rivet Wars: Eastern Front. A tactical miniatures board game with quickfire combat and customisable units, Rivet Wars: Reloaded also introduces competitive, co-op, solo, and team modes.<br/><br/>The game starts with almost zero setup, as each scenario just needs a selection of tiles to begin. Players choose their Rivet faction &mdash; Allied or Blight &mdash; and deploy waves of fresh units to stay one strategic step ahead.<br/><br/>The turn-based gameplay, speed, and visual theme make Rivet Wars: Reloaded feel like an RTS or mobile game come to life. Each turn, players have new deployment points to spend to bring fresh units into battle, meaning adaptive tactics as well as longer-term planning are key to claiming the strategic objectives and scoring victory points.<br/><br/>Battles last from 25 to 60 minutes and can be played individually or as a campaign. The premise is simple and gameplay is speedy. The mechanics and RTS-style introduce tactical nuance to keep players on their toes, letting them switch up tactics mid-game with tide-turning action cards.<br/><br/>The plug system also lets players customise individual units to create combo effects, giving them the edge right when it counts.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The method is simple: knock off the species on the top of the planet&rsquo;s food chain by implanting destructive weapons inside a lesser species. In the case of earth, that would be humans and cows, respectively. Once the greatest local species is eradicated, alien crews can easily swoop in and take all the planet&rsquo;s mineral treasures.<br/><br/>For decades, scouting missions have come to earth to capture and probe these unfortunate bovines.

Damage is determined by both the amount of research cards in their weapon stacks, the rolling of damage dice, and skill points for Alien Scientists in the players possession.<br/>When all the Earthlings are wiped out (or no more cows are left in play), the game is over. Players count the number of Earthling Meeples they collected plus the +2 Extinction Bonus token (earned by the player who wiped out the last Earthing), and the player with the greatest total wins - and gets promoted to Qlepptar's First Officer!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Rather, we have aimed at producing a more colourful and attractive package, hopefully easier to use and improving the feel of being at a speedway meet.<br/><br/>The old plastic boards have gone in favour of a card version; this was done to enable us to produce a colour depiction of a speedway stadium. We hope you approve. If you find the board a little thin, try pasting the two halves onto some thicker card; I personally have not found the need and I believe the card track provided actually lies flat better than the old colour plastic versions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Brass: Catalonia is based on applying the mechanics of Brass to the Industrial Revolution in Catalonia. The rules changes reflect the geographical constraints in Catalonia and the different process of industrialization.<br/><br/>To play, you will need the following from the files section:<br/>- the jpg map of Catalonia.<br/>- the new deck of cards (you can also get them at Artscow).<br/>- the one-page rules booklet (in fact, three pages, but they are each in one language: Catalan, Spanish and English).<br/><br/>RULES CHANGES FROM BRASS<br/><br/>1.    The Canal Period is now the Road Period.<br/><br/>2.    In the Road Period, a player may have as many Level 1 industry tiles as they wish in a given location, if and only if they are all Level 1 industries; mixing of Level 1 and higher industry level tiles from the same player at the same location is not allowed.<br/><br/>3.    The building of a cotton mill in a location with hydraulic power (marked with the turbine symbol) gives a price reduction of 2 PTA in buying coal.<br/><br/>4.    You can sell cotton overland to the Peninsula as long as the cotton mill is not connected to any face-up port. In that case in the act of selling you just flip the mill counter to its other side.<br/><br/>5.    Selling cotton to a Distant Market is also possible, but only through Barcelona, that needs an already built port.<br/><br/>(Source: rules booklet)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Six Days of War begins with a Strategic Segment of card play and counter-play as each side adjusts its diplomatic standing and &ldquo;war footing&rdquo; and shifts unit positions on the map. This is a tense and fascinating game-within-a-game, where cards are played, rescinded, or &ldquo;trumped&rdquo; (at a cost) and Random Events can vary from nothing important to forced actions which perhaps neither player will like. Will the UN peacekeepers be kicked out? Will Jordan give up its neutrality? This stage of the game feels like newspaper headlines, but players can influence the &ldquo;news.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Eventually the war will break out and players will have to jockey for initiative and conduct combat operations as effectively as they can, all while knowing the UN could call for a cease-fire at any time.<br/><br/>Six Days of War comes with counters representing Israeli and the various Arab states involved in the fighting, with a 22&quot; x 34&quot; color map divided into THREE distinctly different battlefield areas, covering the Sinai Peninsula, the West Bank, and Galilee/Golan. Ground units are mostly brigades and regiments while air units (with extensive coverage of the many plane types) represent 24 to 36 planes. Each full game turn equals one day, with 10 turns as the maximum possible time.<br/><br/>The game also includes a historically based scenario that makes for a faster beginning (with no preliminary card play) and serves as an excellent solo game. Also included is a scenario showing &ldquo;Ben Gurion&rsquo;s Nightmare,&rdquo; with a more subtle Arab diplomacy and a less attentive Israel meaning the starting positions are different in key ways. This represents an extreme challenge for the Israeli player. There are also optional rules which explore &ldquo;what if?&rdquo; events or can be used to balance play.<br/><br/>Can you, as the Israeli commander, not only survive and defeat your opponents but create a better future for your country? Can you, as the Arab player, avoid the devastating pre-emptive strike and carve out a long-term victory against a powerful opponent?<br/><br/>Can either player make these &ldquo;six days&rdquo; something that makes for a better future? The choices are yours, with Six Days of War.<br/><br/>",

No longer can the devious Mexican rely as heavily on his gatling gun for victory - his world is about to be shaken up!<br/><br/>Revolver 2: The Savage Guns also includes four cutthroat lieutenants for the 'General' to muster - who are tougher and nastier than anything the Padre has ever had to confront before. Paid in combinations of Pesos and Mexican Army tokens, these gunslingers add variety to the experience - each also 'carrying' a clutch of saddlebag drafting cards.<br/><br/>Determined to fight for the township of Malpaso like a cornered Kilkenny cat, the Padre has a few other tricks up his sleeve: he can arm and train the Malpaso menfolk into a rudimentary fighting force; and set up a bastion at the town's chapel.<br/><br/>",

To escape you must fix the clock before the hour strikes twelve, without being caught by Father Time, or you'll be trapped in time forever.<br/><br/>There are only 54 cards in this solitaire game. You use these cards to build a clock board upon which are the twelve number cards of a clock. Arrange the clock numbers in their correct order to fix the clock, while keeping your player character ahead of Father Time.<br/><br/>When you draw a bell card the clock hands move forward an hour and the bell tolls. You must fix the clock before it strikes twelve!<br/><br/>The movement of the player and Father Time cards around the outside of the clock creates a tense cat and mouse mechanic that perfectly fits the game's theme.<br/><br/>Originally created for the 2018 54-Card Game Design Contest, it is available as a free print and play game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Awards:<br/><br/>From the 2018 54-Card Game Design Contest<br/>-Best Solo Game: Second Place (Tied)<br/>-Best Artwork: Fifth Place (Tied)<br/>-Best New Designer: Second Place<br/>-Best Overall Game: Fourth Place<br/><br/>",

We've streamlined the mechanics and kicked up the realism. FNG2T gives you what you need to run your grunts through infantry combat in Vietnam during 1967-1968.<br/><br/>Don't have an opponent? No problem! FNG: Second Tour also includes extensive solo mechanics so you can play against the game either by yourself or with friends all on the same side! FNG: Second Tour is designed to be played with one figure representing one man and in any figure scale you may already have. Artillery, airstrikes, helicopter gunships, Puff the Magic Dragon, bunkers, tunnels, and more. FNG: Second Tour has them all and much more.<br/><br/>FNG: Second Tour also includes a unique campaign system to carry your Star (your personal soldier) through an entire combat tour of exotic Vietnam. This campaign system not only generates your missions, but also your enemies, rewards for success and repercussions for failure, even the terrain in which you will play.<br/><br/>All this lets us guarantee that you'll never fight the exact same mission more than once.<br/><br/>As your campaign progresses, so does the experience and abilities of your troops. If you command well, some might even survive long enough to rotate home and be replaced by fresh FNGs. But, if you lead poorly you will see more than your share of body-bags.<br/><br/>So throw on your favorite 60's music, lock and load, and head out into the jungle. The enemy is waiting.

Players act as sheepdogs whose goal is to gather the dispersed flock into the sheep pen, but while doing so, they must keep out intruders. The winner is the player who gathers the most sheep (and points) in the pen.<br/><br/>Each player has a personal board, with the sheep pen in the center. The game includes a pack of tiles showing groups of sheep or some other characters, such as a fox, a wolf, a hen or the farmer.<br/><br/>In the first phase, each player has the option to create a set of four tiles selected from a common stock, or to take one of the existing sets. In the second phase, they place one of their tiles on the board and move a tile to an adjacent space. If it is not empty, the tile (or row of tiles) is pushed ahead in the direction of the move. As a result, tiles are rearranged on the board and in the sheep-pen every turn. The goal is to push as many sheep as possible into the pen while keeping every other creature outside.<br/> The game has 3 optional modules, which can be integrated into the gameplay either individually or together to enhance the challenge. The black sheep, if remains in the pen, earns points for the opponents. Trees block some of the spaces.

As a member of emergency room, you were summoned back to the hospital immediately. Your team were there already. While the ambulance rush in, your mission is to stabilize the emergency room within 30 minutes. Good luck!<br/>Emergency on fire is a simulation game mimic the urgency and requirement under the catastrophic scene of an emergency room dealing with patients just rescued from an explosion. This game includes 2 modes: cooperative mode or competitive mode, and players must decide which mode to play before game started. If you worked as a health caregiver, you must try the cooperative mode! This mode challenge players about triage knowledge, manpower and resources management and to overcome the 30 minutes count-down with strategy and cooperation. It can be use as education supplement for health-care students, or a table-top training simulation game for emergency staffs. The teaching effectiveness have been proved by a study from a medical center. If your faculty have multiple boxes of &ldquo;Emergency on fire&rdquo;, you may start a competition between teams and find out how to manage the most effective of dealing with the event.<br/>    As for pure gamers, the competitive mode of Emergency on fire presents a stage for you to overrun your friend. Not only the effectiveness of strategy matters while dealing with numerous patients, but also be aware of your opponents: they will have chance to occupy scarce resource, accidentally &ldquo;discover&rdquo; extra injuries of your patient, or even take over the ward your patient need. For the deeds of your patients! You might have to reach a consensus with your colleges on few political issues.<br/>Now, are you ready for the chaotic reality of emergency room?<br/><br/>",

If you defeat the other witches OR summon your Guardian, you will break the curse, but if you fail, your coven will be banished to the shadows until the next ritual.<br/><br/>In Witches of Wickville, a game of witches in which from 1 to 4 players we can face each other to win the victory. The objective of the game is to be the first to light our candles to activate the ritual and wake up our guardian or we can also win by defeating the enemy by throwing the three cursed potions at him.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the players choose a witch from each team who will represent their character during the game.<br/><br/>Then we place both guardians in the center of the table on their inactive side, shuffle the rest of the witchcraft cards and place them randomly on their inactive side, forming a circle around the guardians.<br/><br/>The game will take place in turns, in which we will have a compulsory action and two optional ones.<br/><br/>We must always move and optionally we can flip a card and/or use our character's ability.<br/><br/>Every time we flip a card, the cards activate an ability that must be executed, that card can produce chain effects, flip the next card, deactivate a specific card... and so on.<br/><br/>The first player to have all four candles lit and the grimoire book on the side of his color will activate his guardian, lighting his four candles a second time will make him the winner of the ritual.<br/><br/>But beware! With the yellow potions, if you throw all three potions you will damage the opposing witch, if you do it a second time, it will be another way to defeat him and win.<br/><br/>",

All told, more than 1000 tanks will face off over the course of three weeks and on a front of nearly 140 km! <br/>On 6 October 1944 the southern pincer of the 2nd Ukrainian Front attacks the forces of Army Group South around Arad and breaks the 3rd Hungarian Army. In 24 hours, the spearhead of the attack, the Cavalry Mechanized Group under Pliev, advances more than 50 km. The northern pincer &ndash; 6th Armoured Guards Army &ndash; throws itself full force against the counter attacks of the 1st and 23rd Panzer around Nagyvarad and cannot break through to the Hungarian plain. <br/>Redirecting Pliev&rsquo;s group toward the northeast, Malinovski hopes to make a pincer attack on Nagyvarad&rsquo;s defenders and open up the route toward Debrecen,  Ny&iacute;regyh&aacute;za and Tokaj, cut Army Group South in two and isolate the 8th Army, retreating before the 4th Ukrainian Front.<br/>On 9 October the southwestern barrier of Debrecen falls but the Germans engage reinforcements and launch two divisions, a Panzer and a Panzer Grenadier division, supported by a Tiger II battalion  &ndash; Operation Zigeuner Baron &ndash; at the flank of the Soviet penetration on 19 October.<br/>Debrecen finally falls on 20 October, Ny&iacute;regyh&aacute;za the 22nd, thereby isolating the 8th Army&hellip; <br/>Is it all over ? No &ndash; taking advantage of the advanced position of Pliev&rsquo;s cavalry corps, the Germans launch an assault with the units of the 8th Army and the Panzer in order to reopen the Soviet trap and destroy the mobile group.<br/>As the Soviet, will you be able to best use your powerful armoured forces to surround the enemy, and as a member of the Axis can you save the 8th Army and protect the outskirts of Budapest ?<br/><br/>Game scale: <br/>A game turn represents two days of real time. <br/>One hex covers approximately 5 km. <br/>The units represent divisions, brigades, regiments, KGs, battalions or HQs, with their organic elements.<br/><br/>",

The object is to initiate, move, and clear a set number tokens from the board. (The number depends on how fast you want the game to go.) The game board consists of a number of squares each depicting a Celtic motif (birds, monks, beasts, etc.) and having various bonuses. For example, if an angel lands on the Fish square, the player can move his or her other angel 4 squares forward. If an angel lands on an occupied square, the player gets no bonus. If an angel lands on the opponent's angel going in the same direction, that angel is removed from the board and has to start over.<br/><br/>The board is based on a wood engraving by Randy Miller and is inspired by the Book of Kells.<br/><br/>The angels are round wooden tokens with the angel engraving on one side and the Celtic knot on the other.<br/><br/>The dice used to determine the move are stone, metal,or wood d4 with 2 tops marked in green or red (depending on the edition).<br/> <a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eonboardgame/celtic-realm-a-new-edition-of-a-rare-craft-game?ref=bggforums\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/eonboardgame/celtic-rea...</a><br/><br/>",

If you are an Adverse Winds you will try to hide and hit at the right moment, causing a spectacular crash. <br/>Most important, no matter how the games ends, there will always be the time for another challenge: the playing time is less than 20 minutes, the game is pocket-sized so you may play it almost everywhere, the random matching of players guarantees a good longevity, both as party game or evening filler.<br/>Despite its simple rules, the game is hard to master. Strategies have to take into account the possible actions of other players. Predicting what they will do is a key factor to win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After a war that almost destroyed the Earth, seven powerful factions, the so-called Regent Houses, now control the Earth and share their rule according to what is known as the Treaty. It is an almost perfect balance of power, since no House has enough strength to claim the throne they share by itself ... Until now.<br/><br/>One of the Regent Houses, the Envers House, has discovered how to travel to the distant worlds of the universe. And with those new worlds at their disposal to dominate and gain Power, all Houses seek to grow enough to claim the title of Earth Emperor.<br/><br/>In Rise of an Emperor: Worlds in Conflict, each player chooses one of the seven Regent Houses (each has 10 personalized cards) and two of the different paths that exist in the world of RoaE to gain power. Each of them (Science, Religion, Economy, Politics, Subterfuge, Military and Exploration) adds 20 more cards to build its initial deck. In addition, each House has three Counselors that can be used on the Council Board.<br/><br/>Players use cards for actions like increasing their House skills, raising their military and technological levels, building buildings, playing the characters of their House ...<br/><br/>The large number of cards in the game (770) allows a great variety of actions. You can make and break alliances with other races and civilizations, send assassins against your rivals, or spy on them to know what they hide. You can try to make your ruler a living God or be the richest House in the Universe. You can find alien artifacts, other races and friendly or hostile civilizations, worlds and moons, powerful strategic resources, build buildings such as the Academy of War or the Intelligence Center and an endless number of other options ...<br/><br/>Each House has a personal board to develop their civilization, and to do so many of the cards must be built before they can be used ... but both space and resources are limited.<br/><br/>In addition, there is the ubiquitous Treaty, which limits the Houses' actions. Many of the actions in the game are illegal ones. So in order to avoid the punishment we must cover them up or legalize them ... or maybe another House can catch us in fraganti !!!<br/><br/>Rise of an Emperor is a Civilizations 4x game, which uses mechanics like worker placement, hand and resource management, and hidden information management. Each game is different and the multiple combinations of customization make it highly replayable.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Equipment cards function like item cards from the base game and prospectors function like resources with a twist; prospectors have two resources! Contract cards give you bonus money and complete when Item cards are completed.<br/><br/>Additionally, the game adds two-sided Trait cards, with each side giving players new abilities during the game. Trait cards are placed in the Apprentice or Tool areas and will reduce the number of Apprentices or Tools a player can use. Traits can also be flipped, at a cost, to use the ability on the back of the card. Lastly, the expansion adds a new optional game phase, Auction, where players can choose to auction one card in their hand.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;What is an implement of war is purely a matter of perspective. Even a blade of grass can turn the tide of battle.&quot; &mdash; Fiyreksis, Supreme Commander of the Flaym 5th, circa 403<br/><br/>Design the battlefield, design your army, design your tactics, design your own path to victory in this sandbox fantasy warfare game.<br/><br/>Background<br/><br/>Long since the vanishing of the Greater Dragons, the War of Eternity has raged. Lacking the guidance of their benevolent creators, the kingdoms of Soroyland are fretted with social, political, and personal dissonance, fueling the flames of conflict. While The War has sundered the peoples, battles have never been without provocation by something greater than hubris, greater than good versus evil. Loved ones lost, ecosystems fractured, communities divided&mdash;it is what pangs the heart that drives the kingdoms into turmoil. Who is right and who is wrong in these conflicts? Who is the &ldquo;good guy&rdquo; and who is the &ldquo;bad guy&rdquo;? The answers to these questions depend upon perspective. Reasons for war are complicated webs of causes and effects, indiscernible by those detached from the source.<br/><br/>With one conflict being catalyst to another, like dominoes in an infinite spiral, the peoples of the kingdoms are necessarily reared for war. For hundreds of years, wise leaders have dedicated their life to the evolution of warfare, honing the craft like master blacksmiths. The studies and teachings of these leaders serve as the groundwork for the Warline game design&mdash;which offers you a rich and flexible warfare tool set. With these tools, you are free to explore all angles of warfare. In your exploration, you are going to experience conflict in a manner that you likely have not before.<br/><br/>Your keys to success are not a race to build power and crush your opponent. Instead, you will prevail by craft and ingenuity. You will outpace and overcome your opponent by means of shock, disruption, and deception. You will make sacrifices to gain every edge. As with the great historical commanders at the Frozen Coast, the Channels of Opulence, and the Flooded Cove, you will lead one of Soroyland&rsquo;s many kingdoms, and wield the multitude of tools at hand to design your own unique and memorable path to victory.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>Warline: Maneuver Strategy &amp; Tactics is a detailed maneuver warfare sandbox game in which you craft and execute a unique strategy every time you play. Every battle begins with interactive &quot;Strategicraft&quot; decisions, where you design a unique strategy by your choice of terrain, fortifications, army composition, deployment, and more. Then, in battle, do you prefer to manipulate your opponent with psychological warfare? Are you more comfortable dominating your opponent with attrition? Would you be more effective by cutting off your opponent's center of gravity? Warline is a canvas on which you can paint tactics of your own creation.<br/><br/>On the battlefield, invent complex, high impact chains of actions and combos to overcome every challenge your opponent throws at you. Warline gameplay is fluid, flexible, and mapped to a decision space that is infinitely broad and deep&mdash;ensuring that situational memorization is not only ineffective, it is nearly impossible. Every battle, and every moment of battle, must be approached in a unique manner. Every opponent that you face, regardless of skill level, presents a one-of-a-kind, interesting challenge.<br/><br/>History Meets Fantasy<br/><br/>The core of Warline's game design is founded on historical military doctrine, but it is the layers of rich fantasy and lore that help sculpt a vision of war that is even more thrilling and epic. Ride terrifying beasts in order to put immense pressure on your opponent. Wield powerful magic to not only manipulate the battle, but also to completely reshape the battlefield itself&mdash;transforming the landscape to your tactical advantage.<br/><br/>Standout Features<br/><br/>&bull; Uncountable paths to victory and the Strategicraft system ensure no two battles are alike.<br/>&bull; No-luck combat and action resolution ensure your wits and creativity alone are what propel you to victory.<br/>&bull; Core gameplay founded on designing complex, high impact action chains and combos.<br/>&bull; Terrifying powers that can transform the battlefield and weaponize even terrain.<br/>&bull; Three unique modes of play: Battle Canvas (freeform sandbox play), History of Conflict (scenarios rich in lore), and Mastery of Command (tactical puzzles).<br/>&bull; Warline encourages creative, fluid approaches to every situation, as your tactical decisions are not limited by rigid patterns.<br/>&bull; Incredibly short set up time, along with average match times of 45 minutes.<br/>&bull; Beautiful, large scale game components that appear as works of modern European industrial design, delivering a stunning table presence.<br/>&bull; Innovative game mechanisms that express vivid warfare while minimizing fiddliness and complication.<br/>&bull; Full support for deep and varied organized play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As the months since the shipwreck turn into years and memories of our past life fade, we now call this strange new land our home. Perseverance has grown from a weathered foothold to a bustling city, where new landmarks improve our living standards, and expansive ranches contribute to society&rsquo;s welfare and the ongoing exploration. The once ferocious Shieldheads now walk among us tamed, and our brave Dino Riders are finally able to chart even the most distant parts of the wilderness.<br/><br/>They come back with tales of abandoned structures in the far reaches of the island, similar to the one that held the secret of Shieldhead taming. If the rumors are true, we may be able to make our peace with even the stalwart Thunderhorns and the fearsome Ironjaws, and our society&rsquo;s influence will soon span the entire island!<br/><br/>And while these eerie ruins hold answers, they raise even more questions. Who are their creators? What happened to them? Are they truly gone? <br/><br/>The answers are out there, waiting to be discovered.<br/><br/>Let&rsquo;s hope we&rsquo;re ready for them!<br/><br/>Perseverance: Castaway Chronicles - Episodes 3 and 4 are two medium-heavy, thematic Euro games, concluding the story of time-lost survivors on a dinosaur island. Each Episode is playable as a standalone game, or in the Chronicle mode that ties four games - one with each Episode - into a continuous story. As the hallmark of the Perseverance series, each Episode features many unique characteristics and a very distinct game feel, but their core mechanisms and concepts are similar, making each new Episode much easier to learn.<br/><br/>In Episode 3, Perseverance is finally safe from the dinosaur attacks and has grown into a bustling city. As players discover how to tame and ride the Dinosaurs (including the new Thunderhorn and Ironjaw species), as their primary action, they may now choose to send a Dino Rider into the far reaches of the island instead of placing a die in the city. Besides streamlining some of the usual area majority elements, Episode 3 takes a new approach, focusing on engine and tableau building. City Landmarks provide powerful passive benefits, while players may build and customize their own Ranches on their player boards, activating them as a secondary action using the new Supply resource acquired from the wilderness.<br/><br/>Episode 4 brings the story to an epic conclusion as you face off against the Ancients, a mysterious race that once ruled the island. Even though the situation is dire, the dimensional storm that made their return possible also presents an almost impossible opportunity: to refit the hollowed-out husk of the Pearl of the Seas ocean liner for one last journey, back to your homeworld.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Honour is everything! Tribal provides players with a game set in a pre-gunpowder tribal/clan setting. The rules  offer some new and exciting approaches to wargaming.<br/><br/>In the book you get: the basic rules; optional rules for missile fire, dirty tricks and honour pools; four scenarios you can play in a variety of tribal settings; in-depth explanation of culture, weapons and combat for Maori, Vikings, Aztecs &amp; Gladiators; extra rules for Stone-Age, Heian Japanese &amp; Iroquois.<br/><br/>Honour is used to drive the narrative of the game. Players are rewarded in honour for the things that they do in the battle. Honour determines who wins Tribal rather than the normal determinants of wargames (killing enemy/taking ground). In turn, honour is a dynamic part of the game - it can be won and lost during combat, the deeds of combatants can win or lose honour, players can spend honour to do 'dirty tricks' to win combats etc.<br/><br/>The game is played with a normal deck of cards. Cards determine movement, unit activation and - most importantly - combat. While cards still have the randomness of the draw from the deck, players can actually be involved in the combat through playing/holding particular cards. Attacking, defending, waiting for an opening, bluffing the opponent - these are all strategies the player can use in a round of Tribal combat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In this game, you'll have the opportunity to design and customize your own koinobori mast and embark on a journey through Japanese culture. Are you ready to elevate your dreams like the koinobori do in the sky?<br/><br/>In the game, each player will have their own personal mast, and in the center of the table will be the festival masts, one more than the number of players in the game. There will also be a row of koinobori cards on the table for players to draw from. During a player's turn, they can choose one of these three options:<br/><br/>Place a koinobori card on the festival masts: Play a koinobori card on one of the masts. At the end of the game and on each mast, only the color of the koinobori with the most presence on that mast will score points.<br/><br/>Place a koinobori card on their personal mast: Play koinobori cards face down on your mast. Each card on your mast will improve your abilities. Be aware that the koinobori you place on your mast will determine your score.<br/><br/>Draw koinobori cards: Take a card from the ends of the row of koinobori on the table. Improving your abilities will allow you to draw two cards or not just from the ends.<br/><br/>The game ends when the festival masts are completed, and at that point, the scoring phase begins. Within each mast, it is determined which color of koinobori is most repeated, and each player will earn a number of points equal to the multiplication of the number of koinobori on their personal mast by the number of koinobori on the festival mast.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score will be the winner<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>&iexcl;Bienvenido al fascinante mundo de los koinobori!

What challenges and opportunities await your governance?  Will you be wise enough to profit from the next noteworthy event to be recorded in the Chronicles of the King?<br/><br/>Chronicles of the King is a mini-expansion for Kingdom of Solomon. Chronicles of the King includes 15 new event cards which raise the tension in the game. While it can be used with 2-4 players, it is especially recommended when playing with fewer than 4 players.  The Chronicles deck creates scarcity of resources, provides interesting new building assignments, bonus point opportunities, and bends a few rules at unexpected moments.  Four Player Aids are also included for use with the base game. This is an expansion and requires a copy of the Kingdom of Solomon board game to play.<br/><br/>",

Players can dig through the scrapyard, steal from opponents, trade, or draw at random from the decks to achieve their goal.<br/><br/>In this 1-4 player game, players must rely on strategy, memory, and a little bit of luck to beat opponents, or the deck, by creating their inventions first. The solitaire version runs a speedy 10-15 minutes, while a group game runs between 30-60 minutes.<br/><br/>In order to win a player must be the first to build 2-3 inventions, which are each constructed from 3 required small machines. These small machines have special abilities which can be activated to give players a 1 time use advantage, such as being able to steal back a stolen part or small machine. In group games each player also has a character given to them at random. These characters all have 1 unique special ability that helps give them an edge in the game. All of these factors make Scrapyard Empire a fun game with a ton of replay value, and endless expansion possibilities for the future.<br/><br/>",

However, after dark when the Zoo closes the Bunch go &quot;out on the town.&quot;  In order to do this, they must get out through the Wonderland Zoo Arch without being &quot;caught&quot; by Mr. Peevly or Botch.<br/><br/>The gameboard shows the Cave and the entrance to the Wonderland Zoo with a cobblestone path going between them.  Mr. Peevly and Botch are placed in the center of the board.  The discs which represent the Bears are placed in the Cave.  The object of the game is to be the first player to get his Bear from the Cave, out through the Wonderland Zoo entrance, and back into the Cave again.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From their website<br/><br/>Mindstalkers is a skirmish wargame. The game starts in the distant future of mankind, but the actual action will be set in various historical ages.<br/><br/>The first line of miniatures and rule sets (in production right now and named &quot;Mission: Middle Ages&quot;) regards the Italian Middle Ages (14th - 15th centuries). The following rule sets will be created according to the preferences of players themselves. New rules will be introduced for different historical ages: from the naval battles between pirates, to remote future wars, passing through barbarian invasions and the two World Wars... all will be possible!<br/><br/>The core rule set is based on fantasy/science fiction, but the game system allows the use of two different levels of rules.<br/><br/>The first one is purely historical, no fantasy or sci-fi elements, designed to play a true historical skirmish wargame: rules, equipment and characters are all strictly based on the referenced age. The second level provides special rules for fantasy elements (like psionic powers), according to the plot of Mindstalkers and adding unforeseeable features and fun to the skirmishes, but always keeping the fighting realism high.<br/><br/>",

Nanite material is required to create the creatures and each player fights for their individual clan to gain all of the collection material to help their tribe survive. The background of the game is as follows:<br/><br/>The planet Xioc has endured major wars throughout decades of time. The life sustainable resources of the planet have returned to their raw element forms. Air, food, water and plant life is scarce, and only a few humans have survived this mass devastation. Nano-technologies, more specifically molecular sized robots called nanots, were invented prior to the apocalyptic destruction. These self replicating machines along with a special material called nanite is the only way that humans have been able to synthesize small life sustainable ecosystems across the planet. Nanite is found in only trace amounts on the planet and is considered extremely valuable.<br/><br/>Factions and tribes of people living in anarchy, fight for what meager nanite remains. War is no longer waged in taking the life of another human directly, but is decided through nano-engineered war battle arenas. A small amount of battle nanite is used with nanots and pattern cards to create virtual creatures that fight for their tribe. The prize is to win the precious collection nanite that will allow the tribe to continue living.<br/><br/>You are the leaders of your respective clans and are battling to keep your family alive! Good luck.<br/><br/>",

Your mission will be to relieve the Nazis of as much gold as possible. Unfortunately you will be parachuting into an area that makes extraction quite impossible.

        "description": "These rules were created after watching Richard Lester's film, 'The Three Musketeers' for the umpteenth time. The fighting there seemed so much more immediate and exciting than the gentlemanly way made famous by Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks even thought these may have been more acrobatic.<br/><br/>In these rules not only is there the possibility of the acrobatic stuff, but we have put in all the fun stuff that makes Richard Lesters view of the three musketeers so distinctive, the head butting, the kicking, the dodging whacking opponents over the head with any kind of implement that may come to hand, even distracting them with the hoary old cry of 'look behind you'. You can attempt to sneak up on opponents, ride over them with horses and even let innocent civilians join in the fun. The rules actually contain two games in one. The first set is for fairly evenly matched sides of swordsmen intermingled with one or two pistoleers or musketeers to surprise the unwary as they come round corners. This fast moving first game is best played with 10 or 15 characters each represented by one figure, and operated by two or more players.<br/><br/>The second game uses all the main rules but with just one or two little alterations and additions that appear here and there. This is the real Hollywood swashbuckling game with invincible heroes leaping from balconies and out of windows whilst taking on dozens of opponents in dazzling displays of acrobatics and Daring do. These rules, as you might expect, are biased so that the superheroes always win, well nearly always.<br/><br/>A full range of 25mm figures and these rules can be  found at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.redoubtenterprises.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.redoubtenterprises.com</a><br/><br/>",

New cards can be added at any time so long as they are shuffled into the pile, and anything that can be imagined is suitable for a card, with the more specific and all-ending usually the better.<br/><br/>Spectators are encouraged to chime in with their opinions and logic to convince others of who the victor should be. The winner takes both cards, and the players continue through until they feel they are finished. If a &quot;draw&quot; occurs, and a decision cannot be made between the shown cards, players may either return their own cards to their hand, or agree to play a &quot;tie-breaker&quot; where they continue to play cards on top of the originals until a decision can be made, and the winner collects all the cards used.<br/><br/>The player with the most cards by the end of the round wins, and all cards can be returned to their rightful owners, or the players can opt to &quot;play for keeps&quot; in which case players would keep all the cards they have acquired throughout the game to use in the future.<br/><br/>",

The attackers tried everything to take the castle using a variety of siege weapons, including Trebuchets and siege towers. Their attacks focused on the north wall, which was judged to be the weakest part of the defenses. The defenders used the lake to bring in supplies, so the attackers built rafts and barges to stop them. They also tried to attack the castle by crossing the lake on barges. Finally, after nine months, disease and hunger forced the garrison to surrender.&rdquo;<br/><br/>&ldquo;The simulation is a matrix game, and for the most part follows the standard matrix game rules . . . Divide the students into six groups and assign them one of the commanders in the order of battle. It's a good idea to include a good student on each team.

        "description": "The game was designed by Antonio Marcelo. It&acute;s a wargame about alternative World War II, with bloody battlefields, zombie soldiers, giant robots, hybrid human/gorilla soldiers, and so much !<br/><br/>The core module comes with two maps, counters (for Russian and German army) and a rulebook. This game is a tribute to the old and classic Dwarfstar Microgames and Metagaming Games.<br/><br/>A Little Part of History<br/><br/>On the 16th of November of 1943, near the districts of Varena, a wood area in Lithuania, there was a fact that definitely changed the course of World War II. A small garrison from Wermacht taking care of that region lived idyllically, in spite of rumors about the defeat in Stalingrado and Kursk have been already heard by higher officers. Rumors about Russian victories and withdrawal of army were public. It was about 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning when the small garrison led by Sergeant Joseph Blummer was woke up by a loud hiss, followed by a large explosion. Everyone thought it was an artillery attack, or even worse, the Russians were invading the country. An alert was issued and 12 men armed themselves as they could and prepared to fight. After tense 30 minutes, only the silence was left, and a gleam from a burning wood was visible. The sergeant quickly got 5 men to follow him in a half track car to see what was happening. They went and were shocked to the spot and a surrealist scene: a vehicle in a shape of a disk, intact, but half buried in the ground due to the impact. The men immediately surrounded the place and sent a radio message to the garrison; they thought it was an experimental German aircraft, since the Fuhrer said new fantastic weapons would come from the Reich labs to the war effort.<br/><br/>Less than 3 hours later, 4 Ju-52 landed carrying SS elite troops, with Himmler himself! The men were both frightened and amazed, because the discovery they made was very important. By 8 A.M., there were over 500 SS soldiers, who arrived by land, beginning to investigate the vehicle. By 11 A.M., Von Braum himself had arrived with his team and they prepared to move the strange vehicle. Joseph and his men were removed from the place, transferred to Berlin, where they were received honors; a distinction from Hitler himself was being promised. What the soldiers didn&rsquo;t know, however, is that Germany had received a gift that would change the course of war.<br/><br/>Armies of the Game<br/><br/><br/>    Germans : Led by Adolf Hitler, spreads the terror worldwide. Using powerful weapons and bio-soldiers, they stand as the most feared army at war.<br/>    Soviets : Biggest enemies to the Germans in Europe. Leaded by Joseph Stalin , they are the arch-enemies of the Nazis.<br/>    Anglo-Americans : The gathering of armies by the U.S.A , England and all the others ally countries. A lot of bio soldiers and outstanding weaponry.<br/>    Nazi Mekas is originally a microgame for two players developed for the MDC III (Microgame Design Contest III), organized by Tom Higgins at Boardgamegeek Forum Boardgame Design.<br/><br/><br/>AN IMPORTANT NOTE!<br/><br/>This game doesn&rsquo;t support Nazism, any other totalitarian political regime, or any human rights oppression. We want to remember that our goal is to show the new generations that war is one of the worst madness of mankind, and Nazism, above all, was an aberration and craziness from disturbed minds, who decided to finish the freedom and parity of men. A madman achieved the power in a big country in Europe and plunged the world in a nightmare for 5 years, resulting in the holocaust and onslaught of more than 50 million human lives.  We loathe this political regime and reject everything it has done to Jews, gypsies, citizens and millions of soldiers from many countries, including Germany itself, who lost their lives to end this nightmare.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Las Vegas is a luck based game of betting and tile placement. The game consists of a board with two spinners a betting field for each player and a central board for placing your coulored chips. Initially you place your bet on your betting field. The first player then proceeds to spin both spinners. From the first he gets a colour and a number from the second just a number. The player now has the option to place his chip on one of the two numbered fields he spun inside the spinned colours area.<br/>The aim is to be the first player to connect four in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonal). This will net you 5 times your bet. If you have 3 in a row you get double all others loses the wagered amount. Then a new round starts.<br/>There are more additional rules for what happens if no 4 in a row can possibly be placed and for 500.- you can buy a dice roll which creates an additional number. Furthermore you can get jokers from spinning/dice rolling which allow free selection of the placing field.<br/>The game ends after 4 rounds of chip placement or after a set amount of cash has been earned what ever you decide at the beginning.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Ypres salient, a 6 mile (10 km) jut into German held territory, was established after the First battle of Ypres in the autumn of 1914. The position was tentative being surrounded by German forces on three sides.  As a result, the Allies started to dig-in forming defensive trenches.  The Germans followed suit starting the race to the sea that culminated in long trench lines that stretched from Switzerland to the North Sea.<br/><br/>In the spring of 1915, the German command was ready to launch an offensive to force the capitulation of the salient.  In an attempt to overcome the unexpected stalemate of trench warfare the German command decided on the use of chlorine gas to pry open a section of the Ypres salient and conclusively cut the salient off.<br/><br/>French Algerians, Territorials, Canadians and British were holding the salient unaware of what was to come.<br/><br/>Dire Heroes - Gas Attack at Ypres is a rule book that is used in conjunction with a standard Memoir '44 board and components to recreate the 2nd Battle of Ypres during the Great War. Players take turns moving their units and launching offensives in order to capture objectives or to force the surrender of the opponents forces.<br/><br/>The game starts with the infamous gas attack and the German offensive.<br/><br/>Requires a Memoir '44 basic set and the Dire Heroes - Gas Attack at Ypres rule book to play.<br/><br/>(Memoir '44 is a registered trademark of Days of Wonder, Inc.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is a blend of operational/tactical level combat and maneuver during the retaking of the island of Guam from the Japanese during the Second World War. The game is played in turns, each one divided into phases for amphibious landing, maneuver, and combat. The game system uses many of the seven Battlefield Operating Systems (BOS) to simulate actual combat and maneuver that both the US and Japanese players must use to fight the battle. Of the seven BOS's, this simulation concentrates on Maneuver, Fire Support, Mobility and Survivability, Air Defense, and Command and Control. The Japanese defenses are sophisticated and well manned with fanatical soldiers willing to die for their emperor. The fight is bloody and sharp. Victory in the game is measured against the time and casualties it took the US forces to actually accomplish the same mission.<br/><br/>The game features US Marine Corps, US Army, US Navy, and Imperial Japanese forces at the Battalion, Company, and Platoon level. Units are initially setup as Battalions and Companies, and can be broken down into their respective elements. The combat system utilizes a set of combat multipliers that players must use correctly to have the best effect. The Japanese player has the ability to conduct Banzai attacks at night and these cause considerable damage as the US player cannot fall back in front of these attacks and must take casualties.<br/><br/>The are 4 scenarios that simulate the The Recapture of Guam, the Seizure of the Orote Peninsula (introductory scenario), From Mount Barrigada to the Northern Shores, and The Fight for Southern Guam.  There are numerous options that can be used to even play between players and make the fight more interesting.  These include additional Japanese forces that could have been there if they were not sunk by US submarines, and having more artillery available for the main battle in lieu of having shore batteries.<br/><br/>Key Features<br/><br/>4 11&quot;x17&quot; game maps of Guam<br/>BOS representations (level of fidelity)<br/>    Maneuver (Medium)<br/>    Fire Support (Medium)<br/>    Air Defense (Low)<br/>    Mobility and Survivability (Medium)<br/>    Combat Service Support (Low)<br/>    Intelligence (Low)<br/>    Command and Control (Medium)<br/>Approximately 800 unit counters and markers<br/>Unit breakdowns (virtually all of them)<br/>Easy to learn and play<br/><br/>",

The more answers the player is asking for (the more difficult it is for the others) the less improvement he can make on the board - the easier he is challenging the others, the further he can move forward on the board, when the team can't reach the demanded number of answers.<br/>All other players (the team) are now challenged to find as many possible answers within 1 minute and try to fulfill his presettings. If they can do so, the team has won this round and each team member can move forward and also has the chance to &quot;beat&quot; the questioner and send him back home.<br/><br/>It is the next players turn to pull a Laterali card and challenging the others by betting a requested number of answers...<br/>As soon a player has reached the finish line he has won the game.<br/><br/>The questions are very difficult, although there are always many answers possible - it is not a trivial quiz game &quot;one question - one answer&quot; and matching answers can only be found by extraordinary methods of resulution. Therefor Laterali can be used as training-tool for lateral thinking methods.<br/><br/>Laterali is available in 2 different game versions, Laterali Light with 432 question-cards or Laterali DeLuxe with 648 Laterali-cards. Both versions include a game board and 12 3D-figurines and a timer.<br/><br/>Laterali is available in German and will be presented at the Nuernberg Toy Fair 2010 the first time.<br/>For 2011/2012 an English Version will be available.<br/><br/>",

Kilajava, the first board game from Christchurch-based Monsoon Games that combines the spirit of competitive gaming with a rare insight into the realities of  global trade.<br/><br/>You have arrived at the slopes of Mt Kilajava, a bare but fertile volcano, to establish a coffee farm. Your opponent arrives at the same moment, and has the same idea... The race is on! Who can successfully grow more coffee on the land available?<br/><br/>This is a fun, strategy-based board game for two players. Unfolding events maintain the suspense until the very end - storms, eruptions and price crashes will claim a lot of coffee along the way.<br/><br/>Mt. Kilajava also makes an important point; that for farmers in the developing world growing coffee is a very precarious occupation, and slumps in world coffee prices can and do have a catastrophic effect on the lives of millions of growers who are reliant on coffee for their income.<br/><br/>With some skill, daring and a measure of good luck you can enjoy watching your opponent lose their coffee to plummeting world prices.  On the way you will also gain an insight into the real story behind your double shot cappuccino.<br/><br/>&quot;Games first and foremost have to be fun to play, but I think they can also help us better understand and appreciate the world around us,&quot; says creator (and Trade Aid coffee buyer) Justin Purser.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Period 5 is a strategy game whose underlying mechanic is based on a juggling notation called siteswap.<br/><br/>Pieces: All pieces are able to move orthogonally as far as they wish until they either come to the edge of the board or meet another piece.  Each player controls 4 of their own pieces.  There is also a cube which both players may control.<br/><br/>Setup: The cube is in the center. Player A's pieces go on one side of the center diagonal as to occupy only one color and Player B's pieces go respectively onto the other.<br/><br/>Play: Players take turns moving either their own piece or the cube. When the cube is moved somewhere the next player may not move it back to the place where it was moved from.  One may not move the cube while their opponent is (&quot;in check&quot;) threatening to win on their next move.<br/><br/>Winning conditions: The player who gets all of their pieces plus the cube onto different colors and simultaneously into different columns (not meaning rows) wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game that's somewhat of a fusion between Axis and Allies and Risk, finding a relatively simple-to-play compromise.  It plays across a game map that is territory-intensive in Europe and East Asia, with Africa and North America trailing along as close seconds.  The setup is abstractly accurate to the situations of the five powers (Nazi Germany, Empire of Japan, British Commonwealth, Soviet Union, and the United States) around the end of 1939 (with a few liberties taken in South America), and features neutral nations (That Japan, Germany, and Russia can attack), vassal-like allied nations (especially prevalent with Britain and Germany), capitol cities, key cities, research facilities, tanks, bombers, oil, and unique special abilities for each nation.  The objectives encourage playing across the entire map, instead of just Europe, and in fact might be more advantageous to do so.<br/><br/>Summary of National Situations:<br/><br/>1) Nazi Germany: Having taken Czechoslovakia, Austria, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Belgium, Poland, and France; and supported by its allies in Vichy France, Italy, Romania, and Hungary; the Nazi-aligned forces are poised to strike at Greece, Britain, and the Soviet Union (though the latter two are incredibly tough battles).  It has been recently brought to the attention of high command that the British-aligned forces have been building in North Africa, however, and Hitler has ordered Rommel there to advance the African front and take Libya and Egypt.  (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)<br/><br/>2) Empire of Japan: Having annexed Taiwan and Korea, set up its puppet government in Manchukuo, and advanced down through Northern China, the Japanese Empire suddenly finds itself cut off from trade with the United States, a prime source of its oil.  The Japanese do have some reserve oil remaining, however, and if used sparingly, might be able to last until the Empire can secure its own sources.  There is much debate on whether Japan should declare war on America, and there is much incentive to do so, but there are some who believe that focusing on conquering China and British-dominated Southeast Asia might be a better strategy in the long run, and others still who believe the Soviet Union is an easier target. (Note: in a three-player game, one player controls both Axis powers)<br/><br/>3) The British Commonwealth: Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and the United Kingdom and its colonies have all declared war on Nazi Germany.  Commonwealth and British troops alike have poured into the battlefields of Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, as well as moved in support of British-dominated Southeast Asia and India.  The British Commonwealth also keeps a wary eye across the Pacific to the expanding Japanese Empire, hoping that their Chinese allies can hold off the insatiable Asian power long enough for the Commonwealth to get its bearings.  Sir Winston Churchill meanwhile petitions the United States to join them...<br/><br/>4) The Soviet Union: Having seen the rapid expansion and great success of Nazi Germany, the Soviet Union now seeks to expand its own borders.  The obvious choice is Finland, but Persia and Turkey to the south also seem inviting.  The success or failure of the Soviet Union rests on its ability to conquer and annex territory in much the same manner as Germany, and thus be able to display a strong showing against the remaining great powers of the world.<br/><br/>5) United States: Haunted by the spectre of the first Great War and rifled with its own domestic problems in the Great Depression, the American people want to stay out of the European War altogether, despite having become the protectors of Iceland.  President Roosevelt sees the danger of a Nazi-controlled Europe, but is having a difficult time convincing Congress of his views.  Although America could possibly get involved in the war on its own, it seems likely that the only thing that could draw the Americans is a direct attack against the United States.  However, there is a more definitive resolve to intervene if the war comes to the Americas... (Note: in a 3 or 4 player game, America is controlled by the British player, who keeps attempting to rouse the sleeping great power against Germany and Japan)<br/><br/>",

The game generates the scenario by way of considering player&rsquo;s enthusiasm for being the attacker and his leanings in events. The basic unit is the infantry battalion. All mechanisms use standard 6 sided dice. Usually along the lines of  'three bases shooting, therefore roll 3 dice'. No paper record keeping. Casualties, disorder etc is shown by adding markers to the unit. Game usually last about 6 turns.  Played on a 5 x 3 foot table. Measurements in inches.  Musket range 10&quot;. Units are motivated and then use action points. Victory is based upon objectives, destructions and ground.  WA only covers AWI. Peculiar to this set are off table flankers, riflemen, Indians and a lot of scenery. A typical army might consist of 9 foot units, 1 cavalry unit, 1 field gun and 4 mounted commanders.<br/><br/>",

These events are actually thought to discourage players from continually drawing arsenal cards, and to randomize things around.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>During the pivotal years of 1915 and 1916, the future of the world hung in the balance as the Royal Navy time and again failed to deliver on promises of tactical success amid the cold, grey waters of the North Sea. But the strategic situation was much different, as each passing month of the Allied blockade brought the Central Powers closer to defeat.<br/><br/>Did the Kaiser's reluctance to commit his beloved High Seas Fleet doom the German people? Was Admiral Beatty the second coming of Nelson himself, or a charismatic, risk-taking glory hound? Might someone other than Jellicoe at Jutland have brought the decisive victory for which the British were so desperate; or, as Churchill feared, might he have lost the War in a single afternoon?<br/><br/>These questions and more are yours to answer as you sail into battle.<br/><br/>Grand Admiral: Castles of Steel includes the following:<br/><br/><br/>     The Grand Admiral rulebook<br/>     250 full-color counters* representing forces of the Royal Navy and Kaiserliche Marine<br/>     Data sheets listing hundreds of individually-named vessels, representing 70 different classes, including every major warship present at the Battles of Jutland, Dogger Bank, Coronel, and the Falkland Islands<br/>     17&quot; by 22&quot; game board <br/><br/><br/>* Requires some assembly.<br/><br/>",

Created by Artix and the team, this card game is fast, easy, crazy fun. Spend a little quality time away from the computer screen with the family, or duel your friends during lunch.<br/><br/>Everyone starts with 20 Health. (Use 10 for a quick game!). Each player gets 7 cards. The deck goes face down between the players.<br/><br/>On YOUR TURN...<br/>DRAW! - At the very start of your turn, discard as many cards as you want into the discard pile, then draw until you have 7 cards total in your hand. After you are done drawing, play as many cards as you want in any order! EQUIP ITEMS - Some cards, like Armors and Pets say, &ldquo;Equip on your turn&rdquo;. To equip a card, place it face up in front of you. Equipped cards remain in play until the end of the game unless your foe finds a way to remove it, or you choose to discard it during your turn. You can equip as many cards as you want on your turn, however, you can only have 1 Armor and 1 Pet equipped at the same time. If you equip a new one, the old one is discarded. ATTACK! During your turn you can make only 1 Weapon or Spell attack and also 1 Pet attack. Add as many enhancements as you want to any attack to increase damage! If you have armor equipped, check to see if it increases your attack&rsquo;s damage even more. Declare all of your attacks at the same time and when you are done, ask your opponent if they can defend against it. After everything is concluded, all cards used during the attack are discarded. (Except equipped Pets and Armors of course.) BLOCKED!? Use a Counter card to undo a block, trap or even another counter! There may be other creative ways to prevent them from stopping your attack too - read your cards carefully and exploit the rules! ANYTHING GOES! - During your turn you may play as many of your cards as you want. Cards will tell you when and how you can use them. Cards that say &ldquo;ANYTIME&rdquo; can be used, literally, at any time... even if it is not your turn... even if the card is still in your hand... and especially if it messes up something your opponent was trying to do! (Example: Stealing their pet with a trap card the moment they try to attack you with it. How rude!) END YOUR TURN - Say &ldquo;Done!&rdquo;, or something like that. This officially ends your turn and starts theirs!<br/><br/>On THEIR TURN&hellip;<br/>MESS UP THEIR ATTACKS &amp; ACTIONS! Use blocks, traps and card special abilities to reduce or prevent damage. If something says &ldquo;ANYTIME&rdquo; you can literally use it at anytime. The most important rule of the game: The cards you play will change whatever just happened. (Example: If you get a chance to steal you foe&rsquo;s armor while they are trying to use its special ablility... go for it!)<br/><br/>WIN!<br/>If you run out of cards, reshuffle the discard pile into the deck and continue taking turns until your opponent is reduced to 0 health and you win.<br/><br/>",

As a great house in this kingdom, you must work with &ndash; and against &ndash; your fellow houses to bring stability, order, and progress to a struggling land.<br/><br/>You will use loyal Retainers from your court to secure your fiefs and gather Labor &ndash; one of the five types of Power you can earn and spend. As you develop and grow, you will find it advantageous to grant land to Monks, Knights, and Merchants, each of whom earns you a different type of Power. This also frees up Retainers so they can be used to take more actions on the game&rsquo;s various boards.<br/><br/>These boards reflect the kingdom&rsquo;s customs &ndash; its political, religious, economic, and feudal structures. Each custom offers the players a unique set of actions, and some include Offices - positions of influence that grant their holders bonus Power as well as access to exclusive actions. Just as important, each custom dictates the types of Power valued by society; houses that produce the right kinds of Power will gain more Glory, and will ultimately win the game.<br/><br/>In addition to paying for actions, Power can be used to change the customs themselves, opening up new actions and offices, and altering the types of Power that will lead to victory. Players must therefore either adapt to new customs, or work to ensure that the existing customs remain in place. As you navigate your way to greatness and victory, you will find yourself arranging marriages, earning titles, erecting grand structures, and fighting alongside your fellow Houses as foreign nations invade the kingdom, but in the end only one house will be celebrated in the history books. That house must, by rights, be yours&hellip;<br/><br/>",

While the new areas are dangerous, they offer rich rewards to those brave enough, or foolhardy enough, to venture into them.<br/><br/>When you use the new board sections it is assumed that the builder of the dungeon has decided to protect his lair (i.e. the objective room) with an additional ante-chamber protected by some of his fiercest warriors. He has also built in a short-cut to the objective room, concealed by secret doors, which leads to another part of the dungeon closer to the exit. Obviously only a great, powerful and, above all, rich individual could afford such safe-guards, so the rewards you expect to find at the end of the dungeon are somewhat greater than they would normally be.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legnica 1241 covers the battle between European and Mongol forces.<br/><br/>Highlights of the game are disproportionate starting forces (in favour of the Mongolian army) and different units comprising opposing armies.<br/><br/>Europeans battle with heavy and light cavalry - with some aid of infantry, Mongol forces are represented by light and very mobile horsemen.<br/><br/>There are three scenarios included in the game: one historical (Henry II) and two hypothetical (&quot;Czech succor&quot; and &quot;Czech Mile&quot;). In the first one &quot;Henry II&quot; - Silesian and German forces  face the Mongol army alone. In the second and third scenarios - the succor of Czech forces in included, therefore they may be more difficult for the Mongol side.<br/><br/>The goal of each side is to eliminate all leaders of the opponent - or to score more points if this can't be done (points are scored for each leader, destroyed unit or captured standard).<br/><br/>This is a typical hex and counter game. Initiative is determined in each scenario and kept for the entire game. Players perform their actions in order, with possible reactions (when enemy units enter missle range). Example:<br/><br/>1. Player A moves cavalry (reaction fire possible)<br/>2. Cavalry of player A attacks<br/>3. Player A moves infantry (reaction fire possible)<br/>4. Infantry of player A attacks<br/>5. Player B moves cavalry etc.<br/><br/>Movement is modified according to tables. Battles are determined by comparing unit strength (with modifiers) in tables and rolling dice. Interesting elements of game mechanics include: fatigue of units, morale (measured on a two-sided track, it works sort of like pulling a rope) and cavalry movement (turning requires more space).<br/><br/>The game includes: one paper board (made of two parts that should be duct-taped together or glued), chits with units (punchable) and additional chits (for marking &quot;charge&quot;, &quot;fatigue&quot; modifiers) that need to be cut out.<br/><br/>This game uses the &quot;Medieval&quot; system of &quot;Taktyka i Strategia&quot;, implemented also in Grunwald 1410 - revised and updated. Therefore it can be used with other games from the series.<br/><br/><br/>A number of scenarios for this game was published in Taktyka i Strategia magazine:<br/>- Operacja Knedlik (No. 37)<br/>- Okrążenie (No. 37)<br/>- Plan Ordu (No. 35)<br/><br/>",

Each player's token moves along a fixed path and draws an encounter card on each space from the deck corresponding to the board they are on. The encounters are either monsters to be fought by die roll or items, which assist in various ways and some of which are essential to progress between boards. Players can either move carefully (they get to see the encounter card before deciding whether to proceed) or quickly (they have no choice but to face the encounter but move further if they face it successfully). To win, the players must reach the end of the board, take the Amulet of Yendor, and return back along the path to the start to escape the dungeon.<br/><br/>",

The game adds (16) 11 x 17 map sheets to the 5 for Telnitz and encompasses the area from Sokolnitz Castle up to the area where Napoleon and the Imperial Guard started the battle around The Zurlan Hill.  The fighting forces added include the remaining 2 divisions of the French IV Corps, Imperial Guard, Grenadier Division, and I Corps.  These forces easily managed to defeat the Russian 3rd, 4th, and 5th Columns, and the Russian Imperial Guard.  This is the game where Guard meets Guard.  The Russian Guard is surely larger than the French, play this game to see how the French managed to defeat the Russians and send them routing away in what would end in the Coalition force being destroyed.  Initial copies of Pratzen will contain replacement maps for Telnitz and a replacement scenario card at no extra cost.<br/><br/>The last, and next, game in the set of 3 is Incredible Courage at Austerlitz - Santon and is due to be released in the middle of 2012.  It will complete the set with the inclusion of General Bagration's command and the V French Corps and the Cavarly Reserve commanded by Marshall's Lannes and Murat.  There are (6) 11 x 17 map sections to complete the northern part of this immense battlefield.<br/><br/>This game will showcase the map feature data of Rick Barber and have a considerable amount of detail for a 100m per hex battlefield definition.<br/><br/>The game also has some nice game system features such as variable combat strengths and a fairly easy to learn game system set of rules.<br/><br/>",

The first gunslinger card game for two or more players.<br/><br/>Out smart, out shoot and out play your opponent in this fast-paced, high action card game.<br/><br/>Check out this game review from Father Geek!<br/><br/>Playing Wild Guns:<br/>Each player acts as a Wild West Gunslinger, with a Gunslinger character card placed face up in front of him, each with unique skills and abilities.<br/><br/>The game play of Wild Guns is quite simple. Each player has a hand of Gun cards and Run cards. In a two player game each player starts with six Gun cards and six Run cards. During the game the players place one Gun card and one Run card facedown in front of him. The other player does the same. When both players have their cards facedown on the table the player with First Shot reveals his Gun card, while is opponent reveals his Run card. Then compare the cards to ensure a shot can be made. If player A reveals a Head Shot Gun Card and Player B Reveals a Crouch Run Card - the attack from player A cannot be made, the Run card avoids his shot. The play proceeds to player B as he reveals his Gun card to compare to player A's Run card. If player B reveals a Chest Shot Gun Card and player A reveals a Jump Run Card, he jumps into the shot! Player B gets to make a shot and rolls the dice, as indicated on the Gun card.<br/><br/>After rolling he compares the numbers rolled his Gunslinger card and dishes out the damage to player A!<br/><br/>Play continues until one or both Gunslingers are dead, with zero health left! The goal of Wild Guns is to be the last Gunslinger standing.<br/><br/>Looking for a party game? Wild Guns is a great party game and can play with up to ten players. Watch out, this is when the bullets fly and the Gunslingers drop dead!<br/><br/>",

Further afield, the US Navy list in Age of Dreadnoughts is greatly expanded to cover the rest of the Fleet, in addition to those vessels that fought with the Royal Navy in the North Sea. From the vast reaches of the Pacific, the Japanese Navy joins the fray, taking part in the pursuit of von Spee&rsquo;s squadron, raiding German territories around Tsingtao and Rabaul, and (for those of a hypothetical persuasion) challenging the US Navy for dominion in the Pacific in the aftermath of the Great War. Finally, a few old friends have their fleet lists expanded slightly, with a few ships that did not make it into Age of Dreadnoughts.<br/><br/><br/>As well as new fleet lists you will find an additional campaign map to cover the Adriatic, as well as a new operational campaign system and an spanning the Mediterranean at the outbreak of the Great War.

In the past few years we've seen the US Army fight its way through the rocky hills of Tunisia and Sicily, painfully crawl up the boot of Italy, storm bloody Omaha Beach, and sweep across the France in what has been described as an 'American Blitzkrieg'. Its now the end of 1944 and that same army, for all of its hard-earned victories, is at the end of its tether. Fuel and supplies are only just arriving in force, the men are exhausted, and the raw recruits are fresher than ever. For the US Army, December was a time to pause briefly to rebuild their stocks and prepare for the final drive into Germany. This opened a very small window of opportunity for the Germans to launch an ambitious offensive with the best troops they could muster. The plan called for an all-out attack through the Ardennes to capture Antwerp, cutting off and capturing several Allied armies, and forcing a peace settlement in Germany's favour. No one, including Hitler himself, was under any delusions about the cost of failure in the up coming operation. For the Germans, it was all or nothing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "There are a lot of quality tabletop football games out there. Some play quickly, where you can get a final score with relative ease.  Some are more complex, giving the gamer a more 'head coach' feel.  I'd like to think that Diggin Deep Football falls somewhere in between, and is the perfect game for the Fantasy Football fan.  You can very easily take your fantasy football roster, plug it into Diggin Deep Football, and play a full game of football with full stats in about 60-90 minutes.  It adds an extra dimension to the Fantasy Football craze.<br/><br/>Gameplay is smooth and should be easy to pick up.  Plays should normally take only one roll of the dice to resolve a play.  Before the play, the offense calls the play and the players involved.  The defense attempts to 'call' the play as well.  If they are correct, penalties go against whoever handles the ball.  If they are wrong, the play proceeds as normal with no penalty to the ball handler.  Think Tecmo Bowl from the old Nintendo days, when you called the right play on defense, you got to blitz the QB.  The better your defense 'calls' the play, the better the end result will be for the defense in Diggin Deep Football.<br/><br/>My vision for Diggin Deep Football would be as a great fit for the casual football fan who loves fantasy football.  Anyone can play a game right out of the box and play with stock teams.  Since the game is played with cards instead of team sheets, you can mix and match players across different teams (like Fantasy Football.  The game also can cater to the more hardcore football fan.  When do you put 'Nine in the Box' against a team who relies heavily on the run, or maybe try to fool the defense by setting up a screen with your backup Tight End.  Diggin Deep Football should have something for everyone.<br/><br/>Diggin Deep Football also has some of the aspects that have become the flagship of any Diggin Deep Sports product.  The more talented players can 'Dig Deep' in certain game situations to tilt the scales in their favor.  Imagine TRYING to play defense against a Jim Brown who is Diggin Deep.  How about trying to convert a 3rd and 12 against a Bears Line backing Core that is Diggin Deep?  The Diggin Deep methodology is not only limited to 'skilled' positions.  Anyone on the offense and defense (including offensive lineman), can dig deep in certain game situations.  The Check the Deck is back as well.  The deck will determine penalties, check players for injury, making adjustments to player's Diggin Deep chances, or any other unforeseen event that could happen during the course of a game.<br/><br/>",

The final docking bays must be entered by exact count. Some spaces on the board have special instructions (lose 2 spaces, lose turn, etc.)<br/><br/>The board is a soft mounted tri-fold with nice line graphics against a starfield background. The board separates this from normal Chutes and Ladders though. It has variable start and finish zones and other traps and reward squares than just the slides and ladders.<br/><br/>",

Remembering the horrors of the Jihad that ended just half a century before, paranoid citizens and opportunistic leaders across the Sphere instinctively girded for the invasions that were sure to come. As ancient rivals once again turned against each other, the Republic of the Sphere&mdash;once a beacon of hope for billions&mdash;found itself nearly torn asunder by hostile neighbors on every side.<br/><br/>A new Dark Age had begun.<br/><br/>Era Report: 3145 describes the state of the Inner Sphere at critical age in BattleTech history: the years of the Dark Age era. Presented as a general overview of the period, rather than a focused report on a single conflict, this book includes descriptions of every major Inner Sphere faction active in the wake of the catastrophic failure of the interstellar HPG grid. Notable personalities, military forces, and an overview of the technological capabilities of the Dark Age era are also provided, along with special advanced-level rules for campaigns set during this time, whether played using the Total Warfare core rules or those found in A Time of War: The BattleTech RPG.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Burger Chef there&acute;s a lot of different orders, but just one burger! Everybody must contribute adding or taking away ingredients to make the best burger, but who will make the happiest customer?<br/><br/>In every turn you roll a 6 sided die with colours in its faces. Depending on the colour you rolled you must add or take away an ingredient of that colour from the burger that all the players are making together. If you choose to take away an ingredient you must also take away all the ingredients above it.<br/>Finally at any time you may spend one of your limited french fries to make someone (you or any other player) reroll the die. But at the end of the game the player with most fries wins points.<br/>When the ending condition is meet, the burger is over and everyone compares the resulting burger with their orders and count points for the objectives they accomplished. The player with more points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kingdom Blitz is a fast-paced fantasy card game based on the MOBA genre. Wielding powerful elemental magic, lead your armies of fantasy creatures across multiple lanes in an attempt to topple your opponent&rsquo;s castle. Lead your Kingdom! Blitz your enemies!<br/><br/>You play as one of six different kingdoms: Knights, Demons, Undead, Elves, Dwarves or Orcs. In addition, you pair one of these kingdoms with one of the four magical elements (fire, ice, earth, and air) to create a single deck of fantasy awesomeness. The play area is constructed in a horizontal line using castle and terrain cards, and the turn is divided into four steps: action, combat, movement, and draw. During the action phase, players place new creatures and cast spells. Then, if any spaces contain creatures from both team, they brawl it out. After combat, all friendly creatures move towards the enemy castle with little regard for their own safety. Finally, the player finishes their turn by drawing up to their hand limit. Players win by moving their creatures to the enemy castle and taking down its defenses.<br/><br/>Build armies, cast spells, and gain momentum to achieve ultimate victory!<br/><br/>",

Calculators can be a helpful tool and are allowed to be incorporated for use. A game should take 30-45 minutes from start to finish.<br/>Players take turns playing out their hands of numbers and sign cards to get their totals as close to the randomly selected red target number card.<br/><br/>Object:<br/>The first player to win five or more red target cards is the winner.<br/><br/>Monster Math cards are some of the best learning aids for mathematics, as opposed to flash cards which have a suggested problem preformed on the card. Monster Math allows the tutor to rearrange the numbers and signs so that the student can see how they would interact in real time. By simply moving a number from the bottom of the equation to the top, the student would get to experience and make the connections themselves as to how the math interacts with the numbers and signs, and the tutor can demonstrate the relationship of numbers and signs with proficiency so that the student could repeat the process for themselves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nine cats have escaped into the park. They&rsquo;re grumpy and would prefer you leave them alone. Nonetheless, you employ a team of animal control agents and your job is to round up the cats. You win by nabbing five of them.<br/><br/>Cat Herders is a luckless, 2-player combinatorial game, designed to be an elegant simulation (an evocative simulation using a minimum of rules).<br/><br/>The game is played on a hex grid. The central dilemma is that, while your goal is to capture cats by moving your herders to next to them, when you move a herder next to a cat, the cat runs away. The only way to capture a cat is approach it at just the right angle and surround it, before your opponent does. It's tricky.<br/><br/>A good analogy for the feel of play: it's a bit like a multi-player version of chat noir.<br/><br/>Rules, design background, and an example game can be found here.<br/><br/>",

The moment that you can extract revenge upon the tyrannical Diamyo and benefit from his vast amount of wealth at the same time.  It won't be easy, not only will you be trying to avoid the Diamyo's detection, but you will also be competing against the other thieves in the night.<br/><br/>Will you escape with the tyrant's treasure or will you succumb to public execution in the morning? Only you can make the difference.<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of a Makura Sagashi &ndash; directly translated as a pillow searcher, a wandering thief that stole the valuables from under people's pillows as they slept.  It is your task to explore the houses and steal as much as you can, avoiding the detection of the Diamyo and his loyal servants.<br/><br/>Using a fast-paced simultaneous card play, players compete to steal the most ryo (gold pieces) and other valuables from the Diamyo's property.  Players score points for each piece of treasure they capture and lose points if they take detection cards.  The game is straightforward, adjustable and contains a level of unpredictability that keeps it interesting across multiple plays.<br/><br/>",

Alice must find the White Rabbit among the Trump Soldiers, to escape from the palace. The White Rabbit might know where to go. Alice who wants to catch the White Rabbit and the Queen who wants to catch Alice&hellip; The hide-and-seek between Alice and the Queen of Heart now begins.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>Chasing Alice is a 2-player game, and each player becomes Alice and the Queen of Heart. With your reasoning, find where the opponent is. The player who catches another first wins the game. The victory condition for each player is different, however, so you&rsquo;ll need a different strategy on each role. Don&rsquo;t forget! Catch her before you get caught.<br/><br/>Game Play<br/>Each player takes a role as Alice or the Queen of Heart. Two players share the space of game board and their locations on the board are hidden. Each player uses a recording sheet to mark his location and information of the opponent&rsquo;s location.<br/>In one&rsquo;s turn, do one action of two as follow.<br/>1. Move: Choose one of the cards and place it face up in front of the Blind Cover. According to the suit on the card, change your location to the adjacent box. &lsquo;The adjacent box&rsquo; includes all 8 directions. You cannot move to the box you have ever been. The Queen may move the White Rabbit only once, and Alice may move herself twice. Make sure you mark your path for each move.<br/>2. Trace: Reveal the two cards in your hand to the opponent, and announce a single location with the card numbers combined. Trace the selected box and the adjacent boxes. The opponent must say how many boxes she had been among those 9 boxes.<br/>After an action, a player can say &lsquo;GOTCHA!&rsquo;. This action is optional, and you can decide whether to do it or not. If you succeed, you win a victory; otherwise you lose the game immediately. Carefully do this action for the game. The condition for catching the opponent varies in different roles.<br/>- The Queen of Heart: Guess where Alice is, and point exactly one box on the Game Board. If it is correct, the Queen wins a victory. Otherwise the Queen loses the game.<br/>- Alice: With no pointing, both players reveal their location. If Alice and the White Rabbit are near enough to reach within a box, Alice wins a victory. Otherwise Alice loses the game.<br/><br/>Game end<br/>If any of the players succeed or fail the action &lsquo;GOTCHA&rsquo;, the game ends immediately.<br/>Or if the Game Cards run out (which means each player took 5 turns) without determining any result, Alice fails to escape and the Queen wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In addition to a black card no settlement can be set because the resources are not available. The favor of Nergal does not help on black cards. However, it is possible to set settlements in front of black cards by using the &quot;scale&quot;. A black card can replace an achievement that has upside a village or town. Black cards don't count as a color within the meaning of the condition of civilization cards (eg. &quot;disease&quot;).<br/>To play a black card, the player needs either more black cards or a corresponding number of color pairs or the favor Nannars.

        "description": "A) The idea behind Blitzball is to recycle the game BloodBowl, an all other game similar to BloodBowl (Kaosball, Slaughterball, Elfball, etc&hellip;).<br/><br/>With BlitzBall, you can use any figures you want, provided you can classify them into 4 classes :<br/>a. Leader.   b. Receiver.   c. Marauder.  d. Blocker.<br/><br/>For example, a human thrower in BloodBowl may be recycled in Leader for the game BlitzBall.<br/>A human catcher may be recycled in...Receiver.<br/>An Orc lineman may be recycled in Marauder.<br/>An Orc Blitzer may be recycled in Blocker. Etc..<br/><br/>You don't have any figure ? Tokens, symbolizing players, are provided with the game.<br/><br/>B) At the beginning of a match of BlitzBall, you choose a team of 12 players, and you field 9 of them in the pitch (so 3 are on the bench).<br/>Instead of using the specific pitch of Blitzball, you can use the pitch of Bloodbowl : in this case, you choose a team of 14 players, and you field 11 of them in the pitch (so 3 are on the bench).<br/><br/>Each position has its own profile :<br/>Movement, Brutality, Resilience, Agility, Passing, Control, Initiative.<br/><br/>In order to have a fluid game, there are NO special skills in BlitzBall.<br/>All aspects of this game is managed by the player's profiles.<br/>Movement : used for ...movements.<br/>Brutality: used for tackles.<br/>Resilience: used for knocked down players, in order to avoid serious injuries.<br/>Agility: used when a player throws, catches, or picks up the ball.<br/>Passing : used when a player throws the ball. A good Passing allows a player to make longer passes.<br/>Control : used when a player kicks the ball, or attempts a Field Goal.<br/>Also the Control is used to give inspiration to teammates.<br/>Initiative : used when a player wants to perform complex movements (feint, jump, sprint, blitz). Also used to pick up the ball in certain conditions.<br/><br/>C) What about the turn sequence ?<br/>At the beginning of the game a team makes a kick-off.<br/>Then it's the turn (called activation) of the receiving team, followed by the turn of the kicking team, etc...until a team scores (TouchDown or FieldGoal). At this stage, the scoring team makes a kick-off, and so on...<br/><br/>D) What happens during a turn (activation) ?<br/>Normally, a coach (you or your opponant) activates up to 3 players.<br/>It is a standard activation : only 3 players are activated, and they can performs any actions allowed in the game.<br/>Sometimes a coach may opt for another mode of activation : Pass mode, Kick mode, Defense Mode, Movement Mode, depending on the tactical situation on the pitch. For example, the Movement mode improves the movements of the players, allows to activate the entire team in some conditions, but the only action allowed is &quot;Moving&quot;. Same thing for the Pass mode. The Kick Mode activates only the ball carrier and allows to escape from adverse pressure.<br/>The Defense mode is the best mode if you want to tackle the opposing ball carrier, but this mode is available only if you roll the appropriate number on the dice...<br/><br/>E) End of game and scoring.<br/>You and your opponent agree on a time limit (45, 60 or 90 minutes), or on a maximum scoring (30 points for example), etc...<br/>A team scores with TouchDown (5 or 7 points), Field Goal (3 points), or eliminated opponents (2 points).<br/><br/>F) Style of Play.<br/>Special cards are provided with the game : they allow to customize the style of play for your team : Pass play, Run play, Aggressive Play, Tactical Play, Polyvalent play, Mixed play.<br/><br/>G) Edited february 18, 2016. You have 2 types of optional players : Goliath and Flanker.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rocket Fist! Form Galaxy Sword! Omicron Torpedo, fire! Giant robots battle in the style of your favorite Japanese cartoons.<br/><br/>Duel Bots is a card game that lets you design your own deck, load up a giant robot with high-tech components and devastating weapons, then duel head-to-head or in a multi-player death-match.<br/><br/>Duel packs contain two pre-constructed decks. The decks in Galaxy Sword are designed for new players to learn the game. Once you're familiar with the rules the cards can be used alone or with other duel packs to design your own custom deck.<br/><br/>-- Game play summary --<br/><br/>Design your own deck of 32 cards or use a pre-constructed deck from the duel pack. There are three type of cards: components (such as weapons or other gear), resources (which focus on hand management) and damage cards. Damage cards go in a separate pile and you draw them when your robot takes damage. When your damage pile is empty, you lose.<br/><br/>Each turn you may put one component into play from your hand into one of 7 available slots. This sets the pace of the game. Components get more powerful as the game goes on: Tier I components can be played right away but aren't very powerful. You must have 3 components on the table to play a more powerful Tier II component. When 6 of the 7 slots are filled you can play your signature component. Each deck has exactly one signature component, and once they start hitting the table the game will end soon. This follows with the giant robot theme, where mega-weapons tend to decide the battle after some back and forth with smaller attacks.<br/><br/>Damage cards first go into available component slots; you can't play a new component into a damaged slot. You may also put damage on a component on the table, which keeps you from using that component until the damage is removed. Some cards let you move damage to the discard pile where it will eventually cycle back into your hand, so that's just a temporary fix. If instead you pay the cost listed on the damage card you can remove it from the game. There are 5 different kinds of damage with 5 different costs, so choosing compatible damage cards is an important part of deck design. You also choose how many damage cards to use (8 to 12) but the total is always 32 cards, so choosing more &quot;hit points&quot; reduces your available number of components and resource cards.<br/><br/>The game has elements that limit the luck factor present in all card games. Certain resources let you choose cards from your discard pile, others from your draw pile. The small deck size ensures you will see your whole draw pile several times each game. (The discard pile shuffles to form a new draw pile when it's exhausted.) Luck plays a factor in which components come out first and in occasionally finding yourself without a component to play which can put you a turn behind.<br/><br/>",

Each player commands a fleet of 18 or 36 vessels, with six different classes; each class has a specific movement capability and range. Each player takes a turn by moving one vessel to either travel around the board to take out other vessels and get into range to capture a planet, or defend one his own planets.<br/><br/>Each game will play differently, based on the strategies developed by individual players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Our Royal Bones recreates the 1214 Battle of the Bouvines using the simple and playable Shields &amp; Swords system. France's King Phillip II Augustus was up against a coalition of German, English, Flemish, and more. Phillip nimbly avoided battle until he could find ideal ground for his cavalry. The result was a humiliating defeat for the coalition that led to the overthrow of Otto IV, and the signing of the Magna Carta by John of England.<br/><br/>This battle isn't just important historically, but makes for an exciting gaming situation. The French have a weak left flank that must be protected at all costs to avoid automatic defeat. The Coalition's center wing has a clear superiority in Infantry, both in terms of quantity and quality, that might just prove decisive.<br/><br/>There are plenty of tactical decisions to be made, and one crucial strategic one: when the French Player declares initiative for the first time, it brings his powerful cavalry reserve-- and that of his opponent-- into play. Do it too soon and the German horse might help turn that vital flank. Wait too long, and they won't turn the tide. Timely deployment is key, and the &quot;right&quot; timing is highly contextual, based on what the players did before and what they do after-- resulting in an engaging and replayable game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Crop Circles is an abstract puzzle game for 2-6 players. Taking the role of aliens warning Earthlings of impending doom, players etch glyphs into crop fields with their spaceships, according to changing rules about adjacency between glyph shapes and glyph shading in order to score points for effectively following the rules set forth by the Intergalactic Communications Council.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player places any number of glyph tiles from behind their screen onto the board in an unbroken straight line, connected to glyph tiles that are already on the board. That player scores points for the sum of the values of only the glyphs played (affected by on-board multiplier squares) multiplied by the number of glyph tiles already on the board that were adjacent to their play. Thus, a long string of glyph tiles played parallel to a previous play can net massive points, so players must balance taking advantage of opportunities for huge points with preventing such opportunities for other players. Finally, that player then draws exactly three new glyph tiles either among five face-up glyph tiles next to the play area or from the bag of remaining glyph tiles, regardless of how many they played on their turn, as long as they played at least one glyph.<br/><br/>Glyphs come in four shapes (circles, squares, triangles, and stars) and four shadings (empty, solid, striped, and crossed). Each shading is permitted only to certain shapes, and when a player places glyph tiles on the board, they must satisfy the requirements of both the glyphs being places and the glyphs they are playing adjacent to. The more complex a shading, the more difficult it is to place on the board and the more points it is worth: empty glyphs have no restrictions about what shapes they may be placed adjacent to and are worth only one point; solid glyphs may be adjacent to only three of the four shapes and are worth two points; striped glyphs may be adjacent to only two of four shapes and are worth three points; and crossed glyphs may be adjacent only to a single shape and is worth four points! However, the four active rule cards that determine these permitted adjacencies will get replaced throughout a game, providing new opportunities to play glyphs. Players must plan ahead, acquire useful glyphs, and play them on the most opportune turns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Poor Bloody Infantry: Campaign Expansion provides more scenarios, more rules, more counters, and more ways to enjoy the standard PBI system.  Fully compatible with PBI: Somme.  In fact, you must own PBI: Somme to use this expansion.  Here's what's included...<br/><br/>You get an eight-page illustrated rule booklet that contains seven additional historical scenarios; two new counter sheets with more men, more markers, and two new counter types (Captains and Shell Holes); a Reference Card; and additional optional rules (such as Heavy Mud, Variable Reshuffling, and new rules for shell holes, among others).  There is also a grand campaign game, utilizing 14 of the scenarios linked together, as well as a Company Game (play a single scenario four times, one per platoon in your company).  There are enough individual soldiers--using men from this expansion, along with those from PBI: Somme--to form an entire company of 180 individual soldiers (with men left to spare).  Finally, notes about British Army organization in 1916, and a section devoted to Battle Plans and Combat Details provide you with background information to help bring the game (and history) alive.<br/><br/>With this expansion, you will have scenarios covering each of the fourteen British divisions involved on the first day of the Big Push.  To quote from the Designer's Notes: &quot;After years of contemplating this offensive, I still cannot come to grips with this, largely, citizen army making such a frontal assault into the face of an entrenched defender possessing modern weaponry.  If PBI helps bring the magnitude of the staggering losses of July 1st home to you, it will have achieved one of my design goals.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gavitt's Stock Exchange is widely credited as the inspiration for the perennial best-seller Pit by Parker Brothers. The box and rules for the original game by Topeka, Kansas-based entrepreneur Harry E. Gavitt say it was covered by four copyrights and multiple patents dating as early as Sept. 15, 1896.<br/><br/>The only thing it has in common with the Pit game developed by Edgar Cayce and first sold in 1904 is the open-outcry method for trading cards and the objective of being the first to collect a complete set.<br/><br/>G-S-E, as it is also called on the box, is themed as a railway stock trading game rather than a commodities pit, and has a deck of only 49 cards: 8 shares in six railways plus a &quot;Fatal Telegram&quot; card. This compares with decks of 65 and 74 in Pit games. Similarly, G-S-E allows players to trade only one or two cards at a time, compared with a maximum of four for Pit.<br/><br/>The play of the Telegram card is very different from the Bull and Bear cards used in Pit. It always starts with the dealer, and is added to the first trade that player makes. In other words, if the dealer trades two cards for two cards, the other player receives two plus the Telegram. That player in turn must include the Telegram in his next trade and so on. The Telegram has no benefit and at hand's end equals a penalty of $100 if held by the winner and $150 if held by anyone else.<br/><br/>Scoring also differs from the later Pit. Railway shares are worth between $125 and $250 (a narrow range than in Pit). The player who first corners a railway must shout &quot;Topeka&quot; in honor of Gavitt's hometown, and scores double the value of his 8 rail cards. The other players, however, also score, each collecting the face value of his largest set. First player to $2,500 wins the game.<br/><br/>Gavitt was determined to foster boisterous play, and his rules specify that bids must be made at least twice as loud as normal conversation, and that players must make their first offers as soon as they pick up their cards, and another every five seconds thereafter. Breaking these rules carries a penalty of $25 for each offense!<br/><br/>",

It starts on the first day of the outbreak and goes forward from there through the terrifying first 30 days. It&rsquo;s a game where every detail has been covered as you first escape the soulless creatures that threaten you to when you&rsquo;re hunting them down and taking back what&rsquo;s yours.<br/><br/>On the way you&rsquo;ll also find out that maybe your most dangerous <br/>enemies aren&rsquo;t the zombies but maybe your old neighbors or even your friends.

Series, where  the Russian Front of World War II was first simulated,  then taking the action to the African Front, the Italian Front , the French &amp; Polish Fronts, game designer Carl Paradis now presents the fifth chapter: No Retreat 5: The Western Front 1944-45.<br/><br/>After the Fall of France in May of 1940, the Battle of Britain put a stop to Hitler&rsquo;s ambitions in the West. While his attentions turned eastwards towards the vast expanses of the Soviet Union, the German Army, occupying most of Western Europe, started fortifying the coastlines to defend the Nazi dictator&rsquo;s conquests against the resurgent Allied might: the vaunted &ldquo;Atlantic Wall&rdquo; was born. Soon, Allied troops will be knocking upon its doorstep&hellip;<br/><br/>In No Retreat 5, players command the Allied or German forces, invading or defending West Europe: France, Belgium, Holland and Germany proper. Maneuvering forces over hexes that are approximately 20 kilometers across, over turns that each represent between a week to a month of real time. The No Retreat series card-assisted game system is there to create on-map puzzles around each hex, unit and battle as the tense engagements rage back-and-forth and nothing is entirely predictable, and also manages the pre-invasion &ldquo;fog-of-war&rdquo;.<br/><br/>The game is split up in two different parts.<br/><br/>The Invasion Game:  Starting in 1943.  It will consist of the preparations preceding the Allied Invasion of Western Europe, with deception, intelligence and build-up efforts being showcased. The D-Day outcome is then gamed using intense weekly turns.<br/><br/>The Front Game: After the Allies are ashore, their beachhead secure (unless they are pushed back in the English Channel!), the rest of the game consists of monthly turns simulating the War in the West, up to the bitter end and probable surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945; the longer the game lasts, the stronger the Soviets position will be in Central Europe, or perhaps Hitler will be able to stave off total defeat long enough for an armistice and negotiated outcome?<br/><br/>The D-Day sea invasion will be shown in great detail, the German fortified positions also, with both players having to choose where to deploy their assets, where to attack, and what kind of troops to use and request from higher command. As the German commander, will you ask the OKW for more Panzers, or more bunkers and guns; will you gain full control of your mobile troops, or will you have limited control, as historically happened? As the Allied commander, will troops fighting in Italy be released to you for an end-run South of France invasion? Or perhaps you will decide to invade the Low Countries instead, trying to capture the important port of Antwerp in a surprise operation?<br/><br/>A simple but effective supply system will show the constraints the victorious Allied Armies suffered for a good part of the campaign after breaking out of their invasion beachhead. Special Event cards will simulate effortlessly the events happening on the Eastern Front, the effects of the strategic bomber offensive, the political pressures put on both players&rsquo; operations by their respective leaders, etc. Will Hitler let you use the Panzer reserves in time? Will Churchill make a bit for a more upfront role for the British units? Will Heavy Bombers be released for more tactical uses? All this and more will be shown and simulated. Embark in your Landing craft, keep watch in your concrete Bunker, the Invasion is coming, and there will be No Retreat!<br/><br/>Western Front Scenario Listing<br/>Regular Campaign Game: The Invasion Game, followed by the Front Game. Players will thus have a lot of leeway in their initial Strategic Choices. What if the Allies had invaded in le-pas-De-Calais instead of Normandy? What if the German Panzers were moved closer to the beaches?<br/>Historical Campaign Game:  The Game starts with the Invasion game already pre-set, and the Normandy landings. Historical OOBs only.<br/>Invasion Game Scenario: Only the first part of the game is played up to the resolution of the D-Day Invasion. Depending on its level of success, the outcome of the rest of the campaign, and victory is then determined using a set of special tables.<br/>Front Game Scenario: Only the second part of the game is played, starting with the Normandy Breakout.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>One 22x34 Mapboard (mounted and two-sided) <br/>Two sheets of 88, 2-sided square units (176 Total) <br/>One sheet of 112, 2-sided round/hex markers.<br/>One rule book (40 pages)<br/>One Scenario Book (24 pages)<br/>Six Play-aid cards<br/>Two decks of 55 Event Cards <br/>Two 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Scale: Each unit is one Division or Corps: Each hex is about 20 kilometers from side to side for the main campaign map, smaller for the Invasion map. Each turn represents a week (Invasion) to a month (Campaign) of real time.<br/><br/>",

At the end of the agreed number of rounds, the player with the most points wins. In the event of a tie, participants can either declare the leading players co-winners or have the point leaders enter an elimination round where they take turns being dealer until one player earns a point and others do not.<br/><br/>There are two roles that change throughout the game: the dealer and players. Each participant begins the game with over/under and yes/no cards they use to make their predictions about the dealer.<br/><br/>Play begins when the first dealer selects a card from the stack, reads the prediction to be made, then reveals the card to all players. Each player signifies how they think the dealer will respond by placing their prediction card face-down in front of them. Once all players have locked in their predictions, the dealer reveals their answer, and players flip their prediction cards face-up. The number of correct predictions by the players will determine how many correct predictions the dealer will need to take the card and earn a point.<br/><br/>Using the same prediction selected by the dealer, players place their answer card face-down in front of them to lock in their answers about themselves. The dealer then makes the same prediction about each player. If the dealer makes at least as many correct predictions about the players as the players made about them, the dealer places the active card in front of them, signifying they've earned one point. A tie favors the dealer, as long as they've made at least one correct prediction. Play continues by the next clockwise player becoming the dealer and drawing a new card from the stack. Whether you're looking to meet a stranger or learn very personal things about your friends, I Mustache U is an exciting experience that is sure to create memorable moments and connect people through play.<br/><br/>",

Stats and rules for these two new star players are in the May 2017 issue of White Dwarf magazine as well as in a downloadable PDF.<br/><br/>Grombrindal&rsquo;s reputation is almost mythological. Tales abound of his shrewd tactical advice on the field of battle; on the Blood Bowl pitch this translates to a mastery of team strategies and the ability to draw the very best out of the players around him.<br/><br/>The Black Gobbo is legendarily devious, as evidenced by his countless elaborate schemes to undermine the White Dwarf. Before he even thinks about setting foot on the pitch, it&rsquo;s a given that he will have already established a web of bribery, hostage taking and other sneakiness that ensures the cooperation of the match officials.<br/><br/>Legendary heroes, this Star Player duo can be used in games of Blood Bowl as long as one player has a Dwarf, Halfling, Human or Norse team and the other has a Chaos Renegade, Goblin, Orc or Underworld Denizen team. They&rsquo;re not hired in the same way as other Star Players &ndash; things like contract negotiations, legal issues or basic civility are pretty alien to them, honestly &ndash; and both must appear in your game.<br/><br/>Grombrindal is looking in fine form: his miniature features a splendid shock of white hair and a magnificent beard covering a purposeful scowl, with plenty of Dwarven iconography appearing on his kit. The Black Gobbo is appropriately robed and behatted, with sneakily studded armour beneath the robes &ndash; and a bomb. He&rsquo;s clutching a bomb. That probably isn&rsquo;t going to end well.<br/><br/>These resin miniatures come as 8 components, and are supplied with 2 32mm Blood Bowl bases.<br/><br/>",

The game has become very popular in all fields of Skaven life &ndash; the Skaven loving any opportunity for mindless violence. In fact, it has been very difficult to persuade them that there is any other purpose to the game once they are on the field, or even when they are just spectating in the stands! Some of the great all-time Player Death and Crowd Death records have occurred in games in which the Skaven have been on the pitch.<br/><br/>Expand, enhance, fill out and indeed boost your Skaven team with this booster pack! It contains 4 resin miniatures &ndash; 2 Gutter Runners, a Blitzer and a Thrower &ndash; each covered in detail and posed dynamically, with all the billowing cloaks, sinister hoods, sharpened teeth and ghastly claws you&rsquo;d expect. the Blitzer is a particular standout: not content with his own natural claws, he&rsquo;s added pointy things to nearly every surface of his body and armour he can&hellip;<br/><br/>These 4 resin miniatures come as 14 components, and are supplied with 4 32mm Blood Bowl bases.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Seven Suitors&nbsp;is series of three games designed by Chris Wray.<br/><br/>The four-player game, Seven Suitors, is a partnership trick-taking card game.&nbsp; The game uses a custom deck of seven suits with eight cards each.  The first suit is numbered 1-7, the second 2-8, the third 3-9, and so on and so forth, with two of each 7 card in each suit.<br/><br/>Seven Suitors is a &quot;marriage&quot; trick game, and the goal is to be the first team to capture and &ldquo;mark off&rdquo; all seven suits. &nbsp;To mark off a suit, you and/or your partner must capture both 7s in a given suit in the same hand (i.e. not necessarily the same trick).<br/><br/>Players start the hand by passing one card to each other player.   The player with the &ldquo;1&rdquo; card will lead the first trick, but he or she need not play that card.&nbsp; The suit of the first card led by the start player becomes the &ldquo;trump&rdquo; for the hand.&nbsp;<br/><br/>After a card is led, players must follow suit if possible.  If not possible, they can play any card.&nbsp; The highest card of the trump suit will win the trick, but absent a trump, highest card of the suit led wins.&nbsp; In the event both sevens of a suit are played and would win the trick, the first seven played wins.&nbsp; The winner of the trick leads the next trick.&nbsp;&nbsp;All captured sevens are public knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br/><br/>Play until one side has marked off all seven suits, which will generally take multiple hands.&nbsp;<br/><br/>There are two alternative end conditions included in the game rules.  Additionally, four special cards -- each with a different power -- are included as an additional variant.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Anti-Cupid is is a trick-taking game for five players where each player gets a chance to act as Anti-Cupid.<br/><br/>Each player gets dealt 12 cards.&nbsp; One of the players --- the player with the &ldquo;1&rdquo; card&rdquo; --- will be the first to act as Anti-Cupid.  The first and third players from his or her left will be partners for this hand.  The second and fourth players from his or her left will also be partners for this hand.<br/><br/>The goal is to have the most points after five hands.  The player acting as Anti-Cupid will rotate, so each player will take on the role once.  <br/>If you are not Anti-Cupid, a point is earned for each &ldquo;marriage trick&rdquo; you and your partner capture. &nbsp;A marriage trick means you and/or your partner captured both of the 7s in a suit in the same hand (i.e. not necessarily the same trick).  Additionally, all players that are not Anti-Cupid earn points for each marriage trick Anti-Cupid captures.<br/><br/>If you are Anti-Cupid, a point is earned for each suit where a marriage trick is not formed by the end of the hand.  Card play is similar to that of Seven Suitors.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>A Traitor of Love is a trick-taking social deduction game for six players.&nbsp; Players are on teams of three matchmakers, competing against each other to see who can make the most marriages.  But there&rsquo;s a traitor in their midst that is helping the other team make matches!<br/><br/>Players sit with members of the opposing team to their left and right.  Each player gets dealt 10 cards.&nbsp; Additionally, from one of the sets of suit tracking cards, six suits are selected, making sure to include hearts.  One of the players will be the Traitor of Love (the &ldquo;Traitor&rdquo;); he or she is the player that receives the hearts tracking card.  The other five players will be plain Matchmakers; they will have received tracking cards representing other suits.<br/><br/>After cards are dealt, each player passes one card to each other player of the opposing team (i.e. each player passes three cards and receives three cards).<br/><br/>The goal is to have the most points at the end of the game, which comes when one player has more than 15 points. &nbsp;If you are a Matchmaker, a point is earned for each &ldquo;marriage trick&rdquo; your team earns. &nbsp;A marriage trick means you captured both of the 7s in a suit in the same hand (i.e. not necessarily the same trick). If you&rsquo;re the Traitor, a point is earned for each &ldquo;marriage trick&rdquo; the other team earns. <br/> Additionally, for Matchmakers on the Traitor&rsquo;s team, if they correctly identify the Traitor at the end of the hand, they get 2 bonus points.  The Traitor loses 1 point for each teammate correctly identifying him, but he gains a point for each teammate not guessing him.  Card play is similar to that of Seven Suitors.<br/><br/>",

Unlike the other Paint 'N' Play games, which featured a board, the Galacta series games were straight miniatures rules designed to be played directly on the tabletop.<br/><br/>The contents included metal miniature figures, paints, a brush, &quot;adventure game rules&quot;, and a 12-sided die. Heritage sold additional Galacta 25mm figures that could be used with the games.<br/><br/>",

The colours of the objects and the background colours also help in the differentiation.<br/>- You have to put down the cards in an area of 4x6 units. A card has 2x2 units, so there are 4 objects on a card.<br/>- You can only choose from the top of a deck!<br/>- The top card of any deck may be used but the taken card must be put down. If you cannot put the taken card down, you have to discard cards that had been put down earlier, until you are able to put the taken card down.<br/>- It is not obligatory to use the top card of your own deck, it can also be discarded.

You actively play at all times during the game.<br/><br/>&bull; There is no sequence of phases, just a never ending battle of all versus all. Players do not have to wait until the enemy has assembled an unbreakable combination to counteract it. You attack and intercept at will, even if your opponent charges forward.<br/><br/>&bull; The game is designed to make as little restrictions as possible and to maximize the potential of the player&rsquo;s creativity, cooperation, and clever deceit to affect the outcome.<br/><br/>&bull; There is very little path dependency. There is no sure victor of the game practically until the very last move to ensure that you always have a chance to win and affect the game.<br/><br/>&bull; There is only little preparation for the game.

        "description": "OPERATION DOWNFALL: the planned but never executed Allied invasion of Japan was abandoned following the US atomic strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Operation Olympic was to launch on November 1, 1945 with the objective to capture the southern third of the Japanese home island of Kyushu. After a rapid establishment of airbases and logistical hubs, this would then support the follow-up Operation Coronet that would strike near Tokyo planned for March 1946. The Japanese had long established their desire for a decisive battle to inflict an unacceptable level of casualties on the invading US troops, fueled by a fanatic devotion to their Emperor and country. The US invasion would provide that opportunity in a battle that promised ferocity to match or even exceed the epic and bloody German/Soviet struggle for Berlin. Operation Olympic/Ketsu-Go seeks to portray this situation in a playable simulation of the event. General Douglas MacArthur&rsquo;s X-Day is about to start: it&rsquo;s November 1, 1945&hellip;<br/><br/>Unit size: battalion/regiment.<br/>Hexes are 3 km across.<br/>Game Scale: 3 days/turn. <br/>Length: 20 turns (1 NOV 45-30 DEC 45).<br/><br/>Game system is a derivative of The Gamers&rsquo; Standard Combat Series. Unit symbols derived from Avalon Hill's The Longest Day are used on the half-inch, plastic counters.<br/><br/>There are three scenarios. The &ldquo;historical&rdquo; plan has &ldquo;historical&rdquo; forces for both US invaders and Japanese defenders. &ldquo;An Olympic Miscalculation&rdquo; adds the Japanese 36th Area Army to present a real challenge to the US plan. &ldquo;Free for All&rdquo; gives players wide latitude to try their own plans.<br/><br/>Rules cover weather, random events, artillery barrages, overruns, invasions, engineers, military police, assault guns, amtracs, evacuations, US replacement costs, air units, base capture and use, beachheads and ports, Rangers, US combined arms, chemical weapons, Japanese civil resistance, fortifications, banzai combat, infiltration tactics, infiltration teams, coastal fortifications, Special Attack Forces (&ldquo;kamikazes&rdquo;), US Little David mortar, and special terrain such as tunnels.<br/><br/>",

Think about 17(21) as a &quot;divertissement du Roi&quot; where the game of &quot;21&quot; gives an abstraction to play and pass those boring days at Kings's Court, waiting for news from the Danube or Low Countries campaigns.<br/><br/>Goal of the game: players will have to battle each other with an &quot;age of reason&quot; army, to win the battle controlling more ground than the opponent at the end of the day of battle.<br/>The players must achieve this through proper use of terrain and military doctrines.<br/><br/>How the game is won or lost: At the end of the day of battle, the players will have to check how much control their army has on the field of battle. The battle might ends in a draw, or in a minor or major victory. So the players will have to control areas of the battlefiled with relevant units to have a good ground control and so to be declared as the winner of the day.<br/><br/>What pleyers do in their turn: Each player will first draft an army, then each player will decide how to implement the philosophy of his army through another draft of doctrine cards. <br/>In each battle turn the player will choose to move his units to cover empty spaces in the battlefield, to send orders activating a proper army doctrine (for example the oblique order) or to order units to attack enemy units in the battlefield.<br/>Combat will be resolved without dice, the game of &quot;21&quot; will be used (the so called black jack)<br/><br/>In the end 17(21) would like to be a portable wargame to let the players experience a &quot;miniatures wargame&quot; in the mood it might be played at Kings' Court in the Age of Reason.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Every time a player chooses to take money as their action, they may also roll 3 six sided dice. With these dice the player forms a result by adding and/or subtracting each die to the result.<br/><br/>When the result corresponds to a building number in his Alhambra, he can place a helper with the victory point side up on that building. Only one helper is allowed per building. With each scoring the player gets as many victory points as the biggest area of orthogonal adjacent helpers in his Alhambra. The helpers stay till the end of the game.<br/><br/>When the result matches a building number on the building market the player places a helper next to one of the 4 building spaces with the +1/-1 side up. Next time the player wants to buy a building from that space he can adjust the purchase price by +1 or -1 to make it easier to match the exact price. Once he buys a building of that space he returns his helper to his supply.<br/><br/>Use your helpers to get the most points during scoring while also making it easier to get your desired buildings from the building market.<br/><br/>Contents: 48 handymen tokens and 3 dice<br/><br/>Gates Without End by Michael Rieneck:<br/><br/>The expansion will feature hexagonal tiles, with six bonuses, one on each corner of the hexagon. Bonuses will include victory points, the ability to switch buildings in the market, or tokens that can be tie breakers for certain building types.<br/><br/>One of these bonus tiles will be placed next to an Arcade (the brown buildings) whenever one is added to the market. When a player buys the arcade, they take the bonus tile as well. Then, they orient the tile such that one bonus points at themselves. Each player will receive the bonus that is pointing at them immediately.<br/><br/>Fresh Color by Macel S&uuml;&szlig;elbeck &amp; Marko Ruskowski:<br/><br/>It's time to decorate! With the Fresh Color expansion players decorate their buildings with ornaments, mosaics and fresh colors to gain even more victory points for their buildings during scoring.<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player gets a decoration board that holds the decorations for each of the 6 building types. Additionally a common task board is placed next to the building market. On it the different decoration tiles are placed.<br/><br/>Every time a player overpays for a building he can either claim a decoration tile from the board and place it on their decoration board, or get colors. Which colors the player gets is determined by the board and with what money type he paid.<br/><br/>Each decoration tile shows what kind and how much of certain colors is needed in order to build it.

They will then manage their hideout and/or acquire the upgrade &quot;Tools of Villainy&quot; cards to become a stronger villain. Finally, they will assign their henchmen and villain to go out and attack the city/other villains to bring in loot and Villainy Points(VP).<br/><br/>Attacks are done by rolling dice. The amount of dice a villain rolls is determined by the amount of henchmen and whether the villain is part of the attack. They roll against the city who have a number of dice they roll depending on its difficulty level. Sometimes heroes will appear and they only roll against the villain not the henchmen. A player can attack another villain's hideout to which the defender rolls an amount of dice equal to their defense.<br/><br/>When a villain reaches 25 VP, every other villain takes one more turn to get to 25 VP. If no one else does, the villain that did wins. If multiple villains do, they have a villain on villain fight to determine the big boss of Megacity.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Following defeats along the Suez Canal the Ottoman government forcibly evacuated the civilians of Gaza and began fortifying the town and nearlby high ground. The Allied forces occupied the Sinai but could only slowly build up forces for a sustained offensive, and only after extensive work was completed on rail lines and water pipeline from Egypt. In the Spring of 1917 this work was completed and both sides prepared for a fight. In the meantime the Ottoman Empire had won significant victories over the Allies at the Gallipoli peninsula, and in Iraq where a British and Indian army were compelled to surrender after a grueling siege. The Allies brought to Gaza hundreds of artillery, the largest concentration of this weaponry outside of the Western Front, including gas chemical shells, as well as tanks. The Ottomans had also rushed reinforcements, including veterans who were at Gallipoli, German advisors, and aircraft.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?

The game board shows five crocodiles on it, with the crocodiles having 3-7 spaces on them.<br/><br/>To start the game, a player places one of their discs on an empty crocodile space. The next player chooses a disc and places it on an empty space, whether on the same crocodile or a different one. On each subsequent turn, a player can play either disc from the open end of their circle.<br/><br/>When a crocodile has two face-up discs on it, whether of the same or different colors, one of those discs is turned face down. If both discs are positive or negative, the disc closer to the crocodile's head wins and the other one is turned face down; if one disc is positive and the other negative, then the disc closer to the tail wins.<br/><br/>Once all the pieces have been placed, the game ends. Whoever has their disc face up on a crocodile scores points for that disc, with the value being equal to the number on the disc (1-6) multiplied by the position of the disc on the crocodile from the tail forward. If the crocodile has four spaces, for example, and you have a 3 near the crocodile's head, then you score 12 points for it (3 x 4 for the fourth space on the crocodile). Whoever has the higher score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Aggression is a war-game for two players. Each has 100 armies to be distributed in certain countries on a map which is drawn at the start of the game. A series of battles are then fought with the object of neutralising enemy armies. The player retaining control of the most countries is the winner. There are three phases, in each of which the same player moves first.<br/><br/>Phase 1: The players take turns to delineate one country on the map. This is done by drawing the boundary lines of a single enclosed area on a piece of plain paper. There are no restrictions on the size, shape or location of the countries, though it is recommended that they be drawn reasonably large. Twenty countries are to be drawn in the standard size game.<br/><br/>Phase 2: The players take turns to allocate some of their armies to one unoccupied country. The number of armies allocated is written into the country concerned and that country is then regarded as occupied. The player taking first turn should identify his own allocations by boldly underlining his figures. Phase 2 continues until all countries are occupied or until both players have allocated all of their 100 armies.<br/><br/>Phase 3: The players now take turns to conquer one or other of the opponent's countries. A country may be conquered if there are more of your armies in adjacent countries than your opponent has in the country under attack. Similarly your opponent may conquer one of your countries, at his turn, if he has a superiority of armies in adjacent countries. To qualify as &quot;adjacent&quot;, countries must have a visible length of common boundary. The number of armies in the conquered country is crossed out and they take no further part. The armies carrying out the attack are in no way depleted and may be used for other attacks later in the game. The object of the game is to retain more of your own occupied countries than the opponent retains of his. Note that countries you conquer don't contribute to your score but merely reduce your opponent's score by one as he will have retained one less country at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The best strategy depends, in complex ways, upon the original map. Several tips are:<br/><br/><br/>     Create &quot;buffer&quot; countries to protect weak countries during phase 2.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Avoid crowding enemy-held countries at the start of phase 3.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The first countries to attack in phase 3 are not necessarily the strongest of the enemy-held countries, but those which, by teamwork, can most damage your position.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;Eric Solomon, Games with Pencil and Paper<br/><br/>",

To facilitate the campaign game, a separated Player Sheet has been added to track the progress of your Character.<br/><br/>You start the game creating and equipping your character, then you will generate the dungeon using the 1PG Deck, that will help you designing the random layout of the map (where and how to connect the rooms/corridors). Each Scenario includes unique events, encounters, obstacles and of course enemies that you&rsquo;ll need to face during your exploration of the dungeon.<br/><br/>Combat is not resolved with a plain die roll but instead provides several tactical options in the form of the available Combat Actions: will you select a Strong Attack or instead a Feint and Counterattack? Enemies very often have special attack capabilities that you will need to evaluate to identify the best strategy: this is especially important when you&rsquo;ll face the Boss.<br/><br/>Scenarios can be played (and re-played) individually or you can play them in succession as a campaign: loot and experience points accumulated by your character will allow to purchase better equipment and improve your attributes.<br/><br/>The game includes three different Scenarios, and new ones are already planned to expand the gaming options.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players control robots on a sleep ship whose task is to awaken all the passengers on the ship and usher them to escape pods before the ship explodes!<br/><br/>The winner is the player who earns the most points as described here:<br/><br/>The modular hex-shaped-tile board sets out a grid of numbered spaces for the robots to travel on. Located at the corners, where 2 or 3 tiles intersect, are triangular sleep chambers. Each player controls two robots which are placed around the outside edge of the board in the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>Robots must follow 3 rules for movement, with the goal of causing sleep chambers to be removed from the board and matched with one of the numbered escape pod cards which are visible to the side of the board (launch bay). Robots must move (1) to an adjacent hex tile, (2) to a space where a sleep chamber sits, (3) to a space whose value is either one higher or one lower than the value of the space the robot moved from.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving one of their robots per turn. Removal of a sleep chamber from the board requires 2 steps. When a robot lands on a space where there is a sleep chamber, the chamber will either be lying down (untouched) or standing up (unlocked). <br/>If the sleep chamber is untouched when the robot arrives, it will be pushed out of the space containing the robot and stood up (unlocked). If the sleep chamber is unlocked when the robot arrives, it is pushed out of the space it is in. This push causes the sleep chamber to be removed from the board, assigning to it the number of the space it was pushed to.<br/><br/>The launch bay contains 18 of the 24 escape pod cards - randomly chosen at the beginning of the game, each with two possible locations to store sleep chambers. Players look to remove chambers from the board that match the numbers of one of 3 available escape pods in the launch bay. If a match is made, the player takes the cards and the sleep chamber to their safe zone and earns 2 points.  If the number of the sleep chamber does not match an available escape pod, but they have an available second space in a pod they have already launched they may place the sleep chamber in this space to earn 1 point.<br/><br/>One of 3 events will cause the game to end. (1) ALL the sleep chambers are removed from the board. (2) ALL the escape pods have been launched from the launch bay. (3) ONE player (both of their robots) no longer has a legal move.<br/><br/>When the game ends, players count points to determine the winner. In the case of a tie, players count escape pods.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "OVERVIEW<br/>Glaves is a trick-taking card game for 2-4 players.  A standard 52-card deck is used; aces are high, and twos are low.  It is a modified combination of two old card games named German Whist and Knaves (hence the name Glaves).  The object of the game is to get to a winning score before the other players do by playing several hands.  See total winning scores below based on the number of players.  The score for each hand is the number of tricks taken minus any penalty points for Jacks (Knaves) taken.  Several hands are played until one of the players gets the winning score (or more).  The player with the highest total score is the winner.  In the case of a tie, which is rare, the youngest tied player wins.<br/><br/>SETUP<br/>Shuffle the deck.  For 2 players, deal 13 cards to each player.  For 3 or 4 players, deal 9 cards each.  Place the remaining cards face down as a draw pile and turn the top card face up.  If playing with three players, take the bottom card from the draw pile and put it aside, face up.  Its suit is the trump suit for the entire hand and is not otherwise used in the game.  With 3 players, taking the bottom card out makes the deck evenly split across the three players.  For 2 or 4 players, the face-up card on top of the draw pile at the start of the hand is the trump suit for the entire hand.  Subsequent face-up cards don't affect the trump suit in any way.<br/><br/>PLAY<br/>The person to the left of the dealer plays a card from their hand face-up in the middle of the table.  They can choose any card from their hand of any suit.  (NOTE: The face-up card on the draw pile does not determine which suit is played, it's just the card that the winner of this trick will take into their hand.)  Each player must play the same suit led unless they don't have that suit, in which case, they may play a card of a different suit.  The highest card of the suit led takes the trick unless trump cards are played, then the highest trump card played takes the trick.  The person who takes the trick takes the face-up card on top of the draw pile into their hand.  The person to their left takes the next face-down card from the draw pile into their hand and so on until the last player has taken a card into their hand.  The last player to take from the draw pile then turns the next card face-up.  The person who took the trick goes first in the next trick.  Since each player draws a card from the draw pile each trick, the players will have the same number of cards in their hands until the draw pile is depleted.  Once the draw pile is depleted, play continues without drawing cards from the draw pile so that each player's hand decreases in size by one card per trick until all cards in their hands are gone.  That ends that hand and scores are totaled and recorded.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/>Each trick you take counts as one point.  Each Jack you took in those tricks counts as -4 points for the Jack of hearts, -3 points for the Jack of diamonds, -2 points for the Jack of clubs, and -1 point for the Jack of spades.  It is possible to have a negative score if you take enough Jacks.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Jack Suit <br/>         Penalty <br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Hearts <br/>         -4 points <br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Diamonds <br/>         -3 points <br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Clubs <br/>         -2 points <br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         Spades <br/>         -1 point <br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The total points across all players scored per hand for two players is 16, for 3 players is 7, and for 4 players is 3.  That's the total number of tricks minus 10 (the total Jack penalty).  You can make sure all scores each hand add up to those totals to make sure everyone counted correctly.  Play additional hands until one player reaches a total of 46 or more points for two players, 20 points for three players, or 9 points for 3 players.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>    <br/>         Players <br/>         Cards Dealt <br/>         Total tricks <br/>         Total points per hand <br/>         Winning score after multiple hands<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         2 <br/>         13 <br/>         26 <br/>         16 <br/>         46<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         3 <br/>         9 <br/>         17 <br/>         7 <br/>         20<br/><br/>    <br/>    <br/>         4 <br/>         9 <br/>         13 <br/>         3 <br/>         9<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>SHOOTING THE MOON<br/>Any player may &quot;shoot the moon&quot; by taking all 4 jacks (instead of avoiding them).  This gives them the total number of available points for that hand (for example, 7 points for a three-player game), and everyone else gets zero points.  If you think someone is trying to shoot the moon, then you need to figure out how to eat the least painful jack before they end up with all the jacks.  Unless a player has the jack of the trump suit and perhaps one more jack, it can be difficult and risky to shoot the moon.  A player who is trying to shoot the moon might pretend to be disappointed at taking each jack, but not too disappointed, or the other players might catch on.<br/><br/>STRATEGY<br/>Queens, Kings, and Aces are often dangerous cards since they take tricks with Jacks in them.  The strategy for this game is to pay attention to what has been played and what that implies about each player's hand, to be careful not to take Jacks by playing more conservatively the closer you get to the end of the game, and to purposefully run out of suits so you can drop a non-trump Jack on someone else's trick when the suit you don't have is lead.  Be sure to laugh and talk trash when you drop a Jack on someone who was happy to be taking a trick only moments before.<br/><br/>ORIGINS<br/>My two coworkers and I invented and play-tested this game from 2-4 players for over a year to refine and balance it.  3 players is the optimal number, but 2 and 4 work fine as well.<br/><br/>GLOSSARY<br/>Trick: One round of play where each player plays one card in the middle.  The highest-ranked card of the suit led (or the highest-ranked trump suit card, see below) takes the trick (the pile of cards played).<br/><br/>Trump Suit: This is the suit (hearts, diamonds, clubs, or spades) which is selected as being higher than the rest of the suits.  If a card of a trump suit is played on cards of non-trump suits, then the trump suit card takes the trick.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The column has three positions - front, middle and back. In general, warriors at the front of the column attack warriors at the front of their opponents column. Other warriors can support an attack.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to collect five trophies. Trophies are won by removing all of the warriors in your opponent's column. Warriors are removed from a column through a strategic mix of attacks and invocations.<br/><br/>Players take turns, with each turn consisting of four actions. The player may chose from a list of five possible actions, which can be played in any number and order up to a total of four. The actions are as follows:<br/><br/>1) Draw: The player draws three cards from their deck.<br/>2) Deploy: The player places a warrior into their battle column. The warrior may be a single card or multiple cards of the same type. Warriors made of multiple cards are stronger.<br/>3) Attack: A ready warrior at the front of your column attacks the warrior at the front of your opponent's column.<br/>4) Strengthen: Cards of the same type can be added to a warrior.<br/>5) Invoke: Place a card from your hand into the discard pile to activate the invocation power on a card.

If a player cannot make a legal connection, they must &quot;spin&quot; the unplayed Blinks until they can make one. When the game ends, the player who had to make the fewest spins is the winner.<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>Place all Blinks together in a cluster and set them all to the Spinner Widget. Take one Blink at random and separate it from the others. This Blink is the first &quot;Spinomino&quot; in play.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>One at a time, remove a Spinomino from the unplayed pile and connect it to a Spinomino in play. Connecting faces must be the same color, and at least one must be blinking. This rule applies to any faces that are connected, which means placing Spinominoes in a cluster is impossible. If you cannot place a Spinomino, you may respin it.<br/><br/>WIN CONDITION:<br/>The game ends when all Spinominoes have been connected legally. The first player to complete the game with the fewest possible respin wins.<br/><br/>Note: Spinominoes is best with a larger set of Blinks (12+) but is playable with as few as 6.<br/><br/>",

It sounds like a group, gathered and talking. As you move closer, you spot them, another party of dungeon-delvers, standing in a circle by a fire, laughing and showing one another their finds. You want that gold. You deserve that loot. You cry out, sword raised and your party charging behind you. Tonight, the treasure will be yours! Just before you clash, however, several skeletons begin to crawl from out of the ground, shuffling to their feet and now standing between you and the opposition. The battle, now begins...<br/><br/>Death in the Dungeon is a set of tabletop miniatures rules for skirmishes between dungeon-delving parties. It is presented in a classical zine-style format and will be released in a series of issues, this being the inaugural release. Death in the Dungeon focuses on party progression with attention to scenarios, story and treasure. Use gold to build a team of adventurers, choose their race, class, outfit them with armor, weapons and items, then send them into the dungeons beneath the world of Kith.<br/><br/>When a game of Death in the Dungeon ends, it truly doesn't. Your party information is saved and tracked and between skirmishes, you can progress the members of your party, buy new weapons, items and more. The game and progression continues until you and your opponent or group decide to end and begin a new campaign.<br/><br/>Death in the Dungeon was written and created by CPOP owner and founder, Neuicon and pays homage to the old school. Included in the initial release, are: a background and introduction to the world of Kith, the core rules, rules on party and adventurer creation, rules for spellcasting, scenarios, rules for looting, rules on handling progression, advanced weapons and items tables and more.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They get closer to try and see what is going on and watch in horror as the killer meticulously covers the body up with leaves and scrub so that no one will see it. When one of the kids accidentally steps on a dry branch, alerting the killer to their presence, he gives chase, intent on keeping his secret a secret. The kids hightail it back to town on their bikes and head straight to the police station to report what they saw. After several hours of searching in the forest, the police finally locate the body. However, given a recent string of disapperances, they have a theory that more bodies may be hidden in the woods. You and your colleagues at The Will Street Detective Agency have been hired to consult on this case and dig deeper for evidence that will lead to the killer&rsquo;s capture. The kids are reluctant to say much out of fear that the killer will be coming to silence them for good so you have your work cut out for you. Find out as much as you can from the kids and identify the mysterious stranger in the woods. Easthaven Forest is a place where many dark secrets live and thrive. If you investigate this case properly and turn over the right stones, you may learn what some of them are and they may change much of what you&rsquo;ve come to believe about Valley Falls.<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: 7.5/10<br/><br/>",

H version was introduced in 1943 and saw numerous improvements over previous versions, including improved firepower and protection, that allowed to continue to deal with even the heaviest Allied tanks.<br/><br/>The Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf. H Expansion Pack contains the same model that players may have seen in the Starter Set. As a medium tank it has fairly middle-of-the-road stats, nothing that shines but nothing that is too bad either, but is versatile and with the addition of some cards can have its performance fine-tuned for the battlefield.<br/><br/>Speaking of cards, the Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf. H comes with a new selection of options, not duplicating the ones from the Starter Set. Included in the pack is Jack Of All Trades which makes your Commander incredibly flexible, granting an Initiative bonus to the tank during either movement or shooting phase. Swap this over each turn depending on the situation, to ensure that you can either outmaneuver the enemy or get your shots off first!<br/><br/>Inside the Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf. H Expansion Pack you will find a highly detailed, assembled, painted plastic Pz.Kpfw. IV Ausf. H miniature and tank card. Your tank can be further personalized to match your requirements using the five crew, module and upgrade cards included.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The T-34 tank was the cornerstone of Soviet armoured forces in World War II. Other tanks may have been lighter, better armed, or had a bigger gun, but there is only one T-34! When first encountered by German forces, they were shocked by just how good it was and scrambled to find ways to deal with the revolutionary design.<br/><br/>The T-34 Expansion Pack contains the same model that players may have seen in the Starter Set, but brings a new selection of cards to enhance the performance on the tabletop. The basic tank has excellent Mobility and good Initiative straight out of the box, allowing it to easily position itself anywhere on the battlefield.<br/><br/>This combination of stats makes the T-34 a natural hunter, able to pick out it&rsquo;s prey and hunt it down. Adding Designated Target to your gunner can enhance this ability by allowing the tank to ignore a targets cover bonus, assuming it has already moved or shot.<br/><br/>Inside the T-34 Expansion Pack you will find a highly detailed, assembled, painted plastic T-34 miniature and tank card.

Buell&rsquo;s Army of the Ohio and then move on to capture the vital Confederate railroad junction of Corinth, Mississippi. Confederate troops, led by Albert Sydney Johnston, were, however, gathering outside Corinth to strike a blow at Grant&rsquo;s army before Buell could arrive.<br/><br/>&quot;Shiloh: Bloody April 1862 (Designer's Edition)&quot; is a two-player wargame simulating the bloody clash of arms that occurred around Shiloh Church on 6-7 April 1862. As the Confederate player, you must try to crush Grant&rsquo;s unsuspecting army on the first day or be crushed yourself by the overwhelming force of Grant and Buell&rsquo;s combined armies. As the Union player, you must hold onto Pittsburg Landing at all costs, until Buell&rsquo;s troops arrive to shift the balance in your favor.<br/><br/>The Designer's Edition restores some changes from the S&amp;T edition to the original rules. For example, in the S&amp;T edition, the Hornets' Nest encompasses a half dozen hexes. In the Designer's Edition it is only one hex, as it should be. There are several other similar changes going back to the designer's original intent. Additional changes include the map, counters, and CRT.<br/><br/>",

Players move around the city streets trying to acquire the right location and the right weapon to eliminate Johnny the Quick &ndash; the guy nobody in town likes!<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds. The goal of the players is to eliminate Johnny the Quick (JTQ). JTQ is not controlled by any player, it is the game itself. JTQ moves around the board using a combination of dice rolls.<br/><br/>The players draw cards from three decks, trying to acquire the right combination of location card and weapon card needed to attack Johnny the Quick. When they move to the right location and have the right weapon in their hands and they get close to JTQ, they can attack. The attack is resolved on a separate board called The Assassination Chart, where the players try to eliminate JTQ using the weapon&rsquo;s field of impact and dice roll.<br/><br/>Apart from playing against the game, players also play against each other. That is why they draw cards from the third deck, with a lot of options allowing players to gain some advantages or create some disadvantages for the other players. If two players find themselves on the same field, they enter the duel, which is a street fist fight. Each player has a particular set of skills which can be upgraded by drawing the right card from the decks.<br/><br/>The player who eliminates the JTQ wins the game. If JTQ is still alive at the end of 10 rounds, victory points will decide who is the winner.<br/><br/>However, each player wants to be the one who will pull the trigger, as they all have some personal issues with our Johnny. <br/>Looks like a chase is about to start and it won&rsquo;t be just any chase.

        "description": "For endless years in a secluded region deep in the heart of a vast continent, four mysterious people have been developing different cultures, merging magic and technology in a delicate balance with nature and among themselves. Now, they must face a challenge: the arrival of new settlers, bringing with them more advanced crafts and technologies, new weapons and fighting techniques, and an entirely different lifestyle.<br/><br/>As the leader of one of the original inhabitants of Altay, how will you react to this challenge? Will you be open to accepting the new settlers and merging with them, or will you focus on your ancient traditions? Will you expand your kingdom or develop new knowledge? Will you build monuments to last forever, or crush your enemies with your armies?<br/><br/>Altay: Dawn of Civilization is an original blend of deck-building, civilization development, and area expansion. Players control one of four factions, each represented by a starting deck with unique cards and with subtle differences in the number of &quot;basic&quot; cards. Each turn, players use their cards to produce resources (stone, metal, wood, knowledge), build new settlements and expand on the board, attack or defend against their enemies, or manipulate their decks or card hand.<br/><br/>The game board represents one of the regions where the four people are in conflict with one another, with each area characterized by a different terrain type and the presence of different resources. Card-playing and board expansions are fully integrated, as many cards will have greater effects if you control the right territories. Using the resources produced by their cards or collected from the board, players can acquire and add to their deck new cards, representing the new settlers and their crafts.<br/><br/>Players can also spend resources to develop &quot;achievements&quot; &mdash; special cards that are permanently added to a faction, granting it additional capabilities or providing points.<br/><br/>Victory is granted by the combination of territorial expansion, technological development, and the success in creating long-lasting memories of your civilization's achievements.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In September 1943, by virtue of the the Armistice of Cassibile, the Kingdom of Italy officially surrenders to the Allies. Nazi Germany swiftly responds by occupying the northern part of its former ally, by disarming its army (Operation Achse), and by freeing and reinstating Mussolini as the leader of the fascist Italian Social Republic puppet state. Several elements of the dissolved Regio Esercito refuse to comply, flee to the Alpine and Apennine foothills, and take up arms against the nazifascist occupation. Like in most other German-occupied European countries, they will soon be joined by anti-fascists and rebels, giving rise to the first formations of the Italian partisan resistance warfare, which will quickly reorganise themselves as &quot;brigades&quot; and oppose the fascist regime until the liberation of April 1945.<br/><br/>In the summer of 1944, after the breaching of the Gustav Line and the liberation of Rome, a new frontline is established along the northern ranges of the Apennines, from the Adriatic to the Tyrrhenian sea. The so called &quot;Gothic Line&quot; will stand until the end of the war. During these dramatic months, the areas around  the Gothic line will witness some of the most ferocious reprisals of the European war, often involving directly the civilian population.<br/><br/>Resistenza! is a cooperative boardgame that relates the partisan struggles in and around the small valley of Lunigiana, tucked in between the Apennines and Alpi Apuane in the western-most portion of the Gothic line, from the standpoint of the partisan brigades.<br/><br/>The game is tactical in nature, reflecting the fluidity of guerilla warfare, although several game decisions have broader, strategic consequences. The brigades must ambush convoys along the valley's main communication lines, thwart nazifascist reprisals against civilians and participate in the final liberation battles. Attacks are resolved by committing combat cards against enemy tiles of unknown value (unless scouted by previous reconnaissance). Materiel airdrops are also represented, through the drop of a die on the game map. The design focus is on evocation over simulation, implying a certain degree of abstraction. A semi-cooperative and a simplified version of the game are also included, as well as a booklet of historical and design notes.<br/><br/>The proceeds from the game will support the activities of Archivi della Resistenza and the running of the Audiovisual Museum of the Resistance (Fosdinovo, MS, Italy) .<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Mini Containers all players simultaneously have the cleaning jitters and a clean-up rage. The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards in your hand (trash). The main difficulty is that you will need to separate your waste and the different waste containers will not have enough room for all the players.<br/><br/>Mini Containers is a push your luck game with a small deck building element. Each round all players decide which cards from their hand they put in their mini-deck. You can choose to play it safe and form an exceedingly small deck with cards of which you are sure you can all fit in the available containers. Or you can bring a lot of trash to the containers and take the risk that you will not be able to play all your cards. In turn order each player decides whether to pass or reveal the top card from his mini deck. If there is space in a container of the same type &ndash; the card can be played. But whenever you reveal the top card from your mini-deck and there is no place for it &ndash; you need to take all remaining cards in all player&rsquo;s mini-decks.  Whenever this happens or all players have finished taking turns, a new round starts. This continues until a player manages to lose all his cards, and immediately wins the game.<br/><br/>Mini Containers is family friendly and quite easy to learn. But the game is incredibly challenging as well. This makes it a perfect game to play with both casual and experienced gamers. The possibility to add different modules ensures a high replayability value. It plays best with 3-6 players but also contains a solid ruleset for a 2-player game and a solo variant.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Deluxe Guadalcanal: The Battle for Henderson Field is a grand tactical game on the efforts of the U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Army to capture and hold the island of Guadalcanal during the beginning of the island-hopping campaign to push back the Japanese empire. <br/>Errors in strategy and logistics at large made this effort extremely difficult for the Marines, as they held on to the island in the face of Japanese on-slaught with dwindling supplies. <br/>Players experience huge swings of fortune from one side to the other and back again as the battle for the island unfolds. Critical to the efforts of both sides is the capture and holding of Henderson Field, an air strip whose control dictates air supperiority and the ability to land supplies and much needed reinforcements.<br/><br/>The game includes a huge 17&rdquo; by 55&rdquo; map, provided in easily printed letter- and tabloid-sized sheets (8.5x11&rdquo; and 11x17&rdquo; respectively), that covers the northern extents of the island. Combat units are mostly battalions, with a smattering of regiments and companies, representing infantry, armor, and artillery. There are also specialized units such as engineers and LVTs that aid in the maintenance or destruction of Henderson Field as well as movement across the difficult jungle terrain.<br/><br/>The basis for Deluxe Guadalcanal is the original Guadalcanal game published by The Avalon Hill Game Company in 1966. The project began as an effort to create an updated version of the original game&rsquo;s map, providing some tweaks here an there for accuracy or playability. Once completed, it was not that much of an effort to also create a new, colorful set of counters (including new informational markers) that simplifies play. It was then a short, additional step to rewrite the rules in a manner that incorporates some of the &ldquo;advanced&rdquo; rules, some new rules and mechanics, and known errata to create a new, cohesive rules set of under twelve pages.<br/><br/>Now, YOU can refight the battle for Guadalcanal!<br/><br/>&ndash; Description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As Iguana, you solve all kinds of cases that your friends and enemies throw at you. To do so, look for clues in the most interesting places in the city, from the Posada de los Ladrones to the Pythonisa's house, from the Museum to the editorial office of the Dromediario. You can declare Sites of Archaeological Interest to prevent your opponents from advancing... or you can open Sites of Interest etc. declared by them. You can use the Talisman of Swift Foot to move quickly through the city. And all to identify the culprit, explain the unlikely, and have a beer in the company of the old barman.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The sprawling Great Bear Rainforest of British Columbia has remained untouched by humankind. It&rsquo;s thousand year old red cedars and 300 foot Sitka spruces shadow uncharted paths. The forest has grown wild and unscathed. Until now.<br/><br/>In humanity&rsquo;s quest for wealth and resources they have pushed further and further into the dense overgrowth. Only this time they&rsquo;ve traversed too far. In the depths of this Canadian forest lies the Viridian, an army of animals sworn to protect their home. Once content to hide, these high functioning animals with human-like cognition have nowhere left to go. It&rsquo;s time to fight.<br/><br/>The attack against the invading human forces is led by Viridian High Marshal Caal, a vicious, but aging gorilla. He has championed Viridian since his escape from the Vancouver Zoo and united a ragtag group of animals who were also seeking safety. The group became organized and strengthened under his leadership, but now he is looking for a successor. You, a young general, must join this fight.<br/><br/>Every game of Viridian: Final Reckoning represents a battle against the humans. Your goal is to defeat as many enemies as possible - place enough of your troops within striking distance to take them down. Every defeated enemy is another addition to your war resume. Additionally, every battle has specific goals you must meet in order to survive. Regardless of your score, if you do not meet the mission goal, you die. Not only are you battling for survival, but you&rsquo;re also fighting to become the next leader of Viridian. The player with the highest score becomes the next Viridian High Marshal.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The first player to get rid of all their Stepses is the winner!<br/><br/>Sound easy? It's not!<br/>One does not simply put Steps on the structure.<br/><br/>You should throw it in a way, so that it touches the opponent's Steps when landing.<br/><br/>You need a strategy that works for you but against your opponents, one that you will constantly need to adjust during the game.<br/><br/>The winner must apply physics, engineering, logic, strategy, and a little bit of luck. All of which are useless without a well-aimed throw.<br/><br/>It is an utterly unpredictable game where you won&rsquo;t know if your next throw will work until you try it.<br/><br/>You and your friends won't be bored while playing the game!<br/><br/>The basic principle of the game is to keep the structure upright on your turn but unstable enough that it collapses on an opponent&rsquo;s turn.<br/><br/>There are six types of Stepses (for example rectangular) with different weights, sizes, and colors. The variations in size and weight mean that each type of Steps behaves differently when played.<br/><br/>Want to add a personal touch to the game?<br/><br/>You can have your name, motto, company name, or logo engraved on the Steps!<br/><br/>For a spectacular victory, take your Personal Steps and throw it with a flip so that it lands with your name up<br/><br/>This is how a Stepsman wins the game!<br/><br/>Play for any Company: Have fun with friends &amp; colleagues, play with your family. It is interesting for children too, you can even play Solo!<br/>If you play alone, you need to throw all the Stepses from the set on the playing board so that not a single Steps falls out of it.<br/><br/>If at least one falls out, improve your skills and start again!<br/><br/>",

In this 254-card booster expansion, players form teams of two and tandem-draft cards two at a time from booster packs. After each team has drafted four booster packs' worth of cards, players will build two decks per team, and then face off in 2v2 matches.<br/><br/>Because Battlebond is designed for two-headed giant play, many of the mechanics in the set are tailor-made for team games. The &quot;Assist&quot; mechanic allows both players in a team to contribute mana towards a spell. The &quot;Partner With&quot; mechanic appears in pairs, and when a player plays half of a pair, they can have themselves or their teammate search their library for the other half. And the &quot;Support&quot; mechanic (returning from Oath of the Gatewatch) allows you to buff up your own creatures or your allies.<br/><br/>",

While these battles often involved relatively small armies for the era, they proved decisive in shaping the future of the United States. Each game in the system is based on one battle of this period, with its own map, special rules and counters representing the military formations that participated in the original action. The rules model the overall effects of weapons and tactics in an era in which regular tactics were tempered by frontier fighting, and include combat, leadership, and morale.<br/><br/>Each hex on the map represents 50-200 yards, depending on the scenario. Each game turn represents 10 minutes to one hour. Combat units represent anything from individual companies to wings (two or more companies) and/or battalions. Each artillery unit represents two to six guns. Leaders represent a single commander plus staff.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Strategy &amp; Tactics #346<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more?&rdquo;&mdash;Cry God for King Harry, England and St. George&rdquo; speech from Shakespeare&rsquo;s Henry V, Act III, 1598.<br/><br/>The siege of Harfleur marked the beginning of King Henry V of England's invasion of France. The bitter and protracted siege nearly ended King Hal's ambitions, and the French garrison's prolonged resistance allowed the French King to mobilize a huge army. The two forces would meet at Agincourt in a decisive battle that shaped the future destinies of both countries.<br/><br/>Players use a standard deck of playing cards and six sided die to conduct the siege. Actions include bombardments, sallies and counter-mining by the French garrison, mining and assault actions for the British. Both sides must make the most of their activations to bring about an end to the siege, while also not running up a butcher's bill in the process. The game is very interactive, true to the history, plays in an hour of less and is easily learned and taught.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

These are the animals in your rescue that you will need to care for. Then each player gets a hand of 5 cards from the game deck. The game deck consists of cure cards and ability cards, and are used to progress the game.<br/><br/>Turns are simple; the player draws a card from the game deck, and then plays a card (or discards an unwanted card). The turn is then moved on to the next player, clockwise. Cure cards are played on animal and ailment pairs in your rescue, which turns them into a &quot;success story&quot;. Success stories are what give you points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>There are ability and instant ability cards in the game deck. Instant ability cards can be played out of turn, as a reaction (for example to skip a certain player or block an ability card from being played). Normal ability cards are used during your turn and as described on the card. Some abilities will allow you to play cards from the discard pile, take cards from another player's hand, or get extra points for an animal in your care.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately once a player cures their last animal, and then all players count the points gained from their Success Stories. The player with the most points wins! In the case of a tie, the player with the most animals cured wins.<br/><br/>",

The players ('barons') take it in turn to draw four dice at a time from a bag and roll them. The barons use the dice the way up they fall, as building blocks to create their castles. When the draw bag is emptied, the game ends and the baron with the largest castle wins.<br/><br/>The colours of the dice faces are important for building &ndash; in the castle, all roofs must be orange, all walls must be grey or yellow. Players must end their turn with a legal castle. Each dice scores victory points at the end of the game &ndash; the higher up the castle, the more points it scores.<br/><br/>Using special Catapult Dice, you can attack other baron's castles, forcing them to remove dice, and defend your own from damage.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ports is a game about abstracted trade between two city-states along a life-giving river. The genesis of the game was as a chess mini-game in an RPG, but it quickly became more interesting than its container. It plays similar to traditional race games such as Backgammon, Sennet, and the Royal Game of Ur, with its canonical theme being trade and privateers competing on a Nile-type river.<br/><br/>On a fish-shaped board, there are two ports on one side and a winding river that overlaps itself that connects the two. Each player starts with three merchant ships in their port and there are two reinforcements for each player on the island in the middle of the river. Each player rolls four binary dice in order to move their ships along the river, ultimately to the other player's port. If one player's boat lands the other's boat, then they roll to see who wins the battle and whose boat needs to retreat to their original port. Whoever gets three boats to their opponent's port first wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

CATCH THE GNOME<br/>In this game, we spread all the gnomes on the table or floor so that they form a circle.<br/>Cards with sentences are placed in a pile, face down.<br/>The player who starts, takes the first instruction tablet, reads it aloud, then puts it back to form a new pile.<br/>Other participants do the same.<br/>The players perform the presented task, and the collected gnomes are arranged in front of them.<br/>The game continues until all the gnomes are collected or the task cards are used.<br/>The winner is the one with the most gnomes.<br/><br/>2. PATTERNS AND COLORS<br/>This game has a similar beginning to the previous one.<br/>We spread the gnomes on the table or the floor, and the tiles with the patterns are placed in a pile, reverse side up.<br/>One player distributes one tile to all participants.<br/>Players keep their tiles face down in front of them.<br/>At the start signal given by the youngest participant, everyone turns over their tiles.<br/>Players choose gnomes matching their pattern and color for their tiles.<br/>If one of the game participants decides that he already has all the matching elves, he draws another tile.<br/>During the game, players can draw tiles any number of times until they run out.<br/>The game ends when the gnomes or tiles with patterns run out.<br/>The player who collects the most gnomes wins.<br/><br/>3. WHERE ARE YOU BROTHER?<br/>The rules change here.<br/>The gnomes land on the table or floor face down.<br/>All players receive 4 tiles to start and keep them in front of them.<br/>Each participant takes turns flipping one elf.<br/>If the pattern of his clothes matches one of the tiles of a given player, he takes the elf to himself.<br/>Otherwise, he puts it back face down.<br/>The game continues until one player collects three brothers who will have clothes containing the same pattern from one of their tiles.<br/>However, the fun with gnomes does not end here, as it is limited only by children's imagination.<br/>You can invent new rules of the game at will.<br/><br/>",

You must keep your wits about you and your lexicon handy if you are going to overcome your opponents to become the wisest wizard of them all... or at least the one with the most Wizard Buddies!<br/><br/>In Wizard Buddies, each player plays as one of five Schools of Magic: Abjuration, Divination, Evocation, Necromancy, or Transmutation. On a turn, a player has three Action Points to spend. They can draw cards or play Spell Cards, Item Cards, or Wizard Cards, each at varying costs of Action Points. For example, Spell Cards and Item Cards cost one Action Point, but playing a Spell Card that aligns with your School of Magic won't cost you any. Similarly, playing a Wizard Card costs two Action Points. This is a hefty price to pay, but having the right combination of Wizard Cards in your play area is the key to winning. The game ends when a player has all five Schools of Magic accounted for in their play area OR three Wizard Cards from the same School of Magic in their play area that matches their own School. Magic can quickly spiral out of control, so be strategic in your card management and effective in your spell-casting!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Everyone else splits into two teams and must use their wits and their cards to convince the conductor to spare their lives!<br/><br/>Players accomplish this goal by adding &quot;innocent&quot; cards to their track, &quot;guilty&quot; cards to their opponent's track, and modifier cards to anything the want. Once the tracks are down and the modifiers are in play, players must verbally argue to convince the judge which track to go down.<br/><br/>When the conductor makes their decision, everyone on the losing track receives a &quot;death&quot; token. At the end of a round after everyone has had the opportunity to be the conductor, the player(s) with the fewest death tokens win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Islebound: Emerald Edition is a special edition of the game with some altered components and rules. It's best to think of it as a variant of the game, rather than a 2nd edition. An upgrade gameplay kit will be available, along with a second kit with deluxe components (wooden ships and metal coins).<br/><br/>This edition of Islebound removes the book resource from the original game and replaces it with emeralds. Emeralds have different uses than books. You collect them when visiting a player-owned town, and also when you take over a town. Emeralds must be used to buy building cards, and they can also be used to perform special abilities, such as keeping pirates and serpents after combat! The building deck is also revised to account for this resource change. It includes altered building cards from both the original game and some from the Metropolis expansion. There will not be a building card expansion for Islebound: Emerald Edition, and the Metropolis expansion is not compatible with this version.<br/><br/>",

The soil of the fields will forever taste of the blood of warriors sacrificed for the madness of men corrupted by evil. Kreel has no second thoughts or regrets, nor do the men he has gathered around him for this final march, during which it will be increasingly difficult to distinguish between good and evil...<br/><br/>The March Against the Tyrant is an epic adventure that will lead the players to face a certain enemy, but following a path of choices that will determine their conduct and integrity.

The continuous infiltration of chaos power from outside the continent has created extremely harsh living conditions for creatures. Due to the restraint of the truth power, the chaos power cannot directly invade &quot;Taiyi&quot;. However, it uses the desires of sentient beings in &quot;Taiyi&quot; and manipulates puppets to greedily devour the world of &quot;Taiyi&quot;&hellip;&hellip;<br/><br/>Win or Die stands as a fast-paced and highly competitive multiplayer strategic board game, focusing on 1V1 game mode. Its core mechanism akin to the classic game of Stratego. Game elements includes legion formation, fog of war, terrain occupation, unit countering, collection and allocation of resources, etc.<br/>Players engage in battles without prior knowledge of their opponent's legion, launching attacks or using skills to unveil their deployment and lay them to ruin.<br/><br/>There are five selectable factions for players. Each faction has one leader and 6 different units. Each leader has two skill combinations, allowing players to form different legions.<br/><br/>Win or Die released in China in 2020 and received a score of 7.9 on Gstone (the largest Chinese board game database and social app).

        "description": "Tiny Epic Cthulhu is a 45-minute, 1-4 player cooperative game that will immerse players in a world of spinning madness! Players take the roles of unique characters residing in a cold, forgotten island town off the coast of 1920s New Arkhamoore. However, all is not well in this seemingly peaceful town. Cosmic horrors are emerging from the dense sea fog, plunging the once sleepy town into a state of chaos.<br/><br/>As players navigate through the game, they must work together to translate the Necronomicon, unveil the Great Old One, and seal the portals to banish the impending horror back into the cosmic realm. To achieve this, players must tap into the madness that surrounds the town, using it to translate pages, battle against shamblers, and prevent locations from succumbing to pure horror. The cusp of madness gives players benefits like more movement, stronger attacks, and cosmic intellect. However, they must be cautious not to push their own minds too far, as the line between sanity and madness is a delicate one.In this game, madness is a valuable resource that can be used to translate pages and enhance player abilities, but excessive madness can lead to defeat. The pressure to save the town is felt from the very first spin!<br/><br/>Tiny Epic Cthulhu offers a tense and engaging gameplay experience, featuring innovative bag-building and push your luck mechanics. It includes a surprising component - a spinner! - which perfectly captures the essence of Lovecraftian madness and chaos, while still maintaining the strategic elements that players have come to expect from the Tiny Epic series. Each player will need to utilize their special powers, make use of the unique actions available in the town, and carefully manage their own madness. With its compact box and easy-to-understand rules, Tiny Epic Cthulhu offers meaningful decisions and layered strategies that will captivate players. It is a thrilling addition to the Tiny Epic series, providing an exciting and immersive gaming experience.<br/><br/>",

The Conductors can have special rules, change the number of cards drawn each round, or even increase the number of rounds played. The VIPs, meanwhile, work similarly to those in the standard game. However, 2 of them have multicolored tickets with numbers, constraining their placement.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tiberius Claudius Nero's father was lucky to escape execution by Octavian Caesar after the siege of Perusia in 40 BC. His parents took the infant Tiberius and fled from the blood-chilling vengeance of the future Emperor Augustus. As they made their perilous escape from Italy nobody gave a dried fig for the boy's prospects. So how could he possibly have become Augustus' heir and successor?<br/><br/>It is 11BC and the succession plans of Roman Emperor Caesar Augustus have suffered a calamity: his trusted friend, son-in-law and Heir-apparent, Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, has died suddenly. There is a vacuum into which several talented men wish to step. Although they don&rsquo;t yet know it, all of Augustus&rsquo;s male heirs are also destined to die before him, and the man who succeeds in replacing Agrippa at Augustus&rsquo;s right hand will ultimately become the Emperor of Rome, the most powerful man in the World.<br/><br/>The players take the roles of real Roman Noblemen, each having recently finished a term as Consul of Rome. This, plus ambition, qualifies them for the most prestigious jobs in the service of Augustus and the Empire.<br/><br/>Each of the 8 turns represents 3 years. In each turn Augustus asks the Nobles to do 6 jobs. The 6 jobs are depicted by Career Cards. The Nobles will use their influence with Augustus to get the first choice of the jobs. The jobs will help the Nobles in several areas that any Roman Noble must be seen to excel at, in order to rise above their fellows. They do this by placing cubes into the boxes of the main board as prescribed by the Career Cards. Those boxes include commanding Rome's Legions, Conquering new provinces, Governing the existing one, serving the gods of the State religion, helping Augustus in Rome, and hopefully being permitted to ride at Augustus' side through the Forum in a Triumph. Each Noble will try to marry into Augustus's family. And with the right collection of cubes a Noble can also be adopted as Augustus's Son.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Herd: Fleece Your Friends is a competitive card game where luck and skill are equal partners on the path to victory. So, grab your crook and let's go! In Herd, you are obsessed with one thing: creating the greatest herds in the land. Score points by acquiring geep, a half-goat half-sheep hybrid, and organizing them into herds. Protect your herds from marauding wolves, but if a wolf emerges from the hills you can send it to devour the herd of another player.<br/><br/>Players are dealt a hand of three cards to start the game. During their turn, players begin by drawing a card from the draw pile. Four options are then available: Form a herd, play a wolf on another player's herd, play a specialty card, or allow the next player to go. A player scores points by forming herds using three geep cards of the appropriate colors. Herd: Fleece your Friends is played in rounds. A round ends after one of the players plays her last card and has nothing else in her hand. Other players have one final turn. At the end of the round, the point values of the player's herds are totaled and the point value of the cards remaining in the player's hand are subtracted from this total. This is the player's score for the round. The player with the highest total wins a victory token. The first player to collect three victory tokens is the winner of the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Your story is just beginning...<br/><br/>Following the Lord Ruler&rsquo;s downfall in Mistborn: The Final Empire, the surviving noble Houses face a brave new world filled with great opportunity and even greater danger. With the empire in disarray and the populace liberated from the Steel Ministry&rsquo;s iron grip, the nobility is free to pursue new agendas and ancient vendettas.<br/><br/>Protecting the capital is the provisional government of King Elend Venture, scion of House Venture and beloved of Vin, a powerful skaa Mistborn. Together with the survivors of Kelsier&rsquo;s crew, Elend and the Luthadel Assembly spearhead a fledgling republic led by commoners and noblemen alike. They are supported by lesser Houses like Penrod and the Church of the Survivor &mdash; skaa faithful revering Kelsier as a god &mdash; and the people are taking their first wobbly steps toward self-rule.<br/><br/>Outside the city walls, threats abound. Minor kingdoms squabble and divide the empire into lots. Bandits terrorize the countryside. Hulking koloss &mdash; devastating engines of fury and destruction now freed from the Lord Ruler&rsquo;s control &mdash; wantonly lay waste to villages and towns. Amid the chaos, Houses Cett, Lekal, and Venture amass armies to impose order and seize control of this new world. These Houses now march on Luthadel, their eyes set upon the crown jewel of the Empire and its trove of the precious Atium.<br/><br/>Beyond this mounting conflict, strange supernatural forces are stirring. The mists that dominate the night now come during the day as well. Whole villages fall to a strange sickness, and fearful rumors persist of a spirit wandering the mist. It&rsquo;s up to Vin, the scholar Sazed, and their allies to learn why this is happening &mdash; and save the world before it all falls apart.<br/><br/>In The Siege of Luthadel, the noble Houses that survived the Lord Ruler&rsquo;s fall are rebuilding and addressing the myriad Problems of the aftermath to curry the Favor of the people. In this desperate time, a new and bitter rift has developed: should a new Lord Ruler rise to power, or should the people determine their own fate? This disagreement leads to a military conflict between the Houses, and a siege of the capital city of Luthadel.<br/><br/>Through their actions, the leader of each House supports either the Attackers at the city walls, or the city&rsquo;s beleaguered Defenders. Their decisions win the Allegiance of those who believe in their cause, and the Impact of their choices will determine which faction is victorious.<br/><br/>Key to this burgeoning war is control of the Koloss, a terrifying horde of savage brutes Rampaging through the countryside, massing their Spoils of war as they march towards the capital&hellip;<br/><br/>Vin&rsquo;s journey to discover the truth of the mists terrorizing the world, and the truth of the Hero of Ages, becomes a race against time as the inevitable Battle of Luthadel approaches. Will she rescue the city before it collapses beneath the weight of the siege?<br/><br/>This is where you come in&hellip;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Storm Over Asia is both a companion game to GMT&rsquo;s A World at War and Gathering Storm, and is a game in its own right, with its own victory conditions. Starting in 1935, Japan, China, Britain, and Russia prepare for war without being sure of just what is coming. Japan must balance its expansion in China, an impending confrontation with the United States and Russia, and the impact of the Pacific theater in a global war. China, Britain, and Russia must try to resist immediate Japanese expansion, while at the same time laying the groundwork for the successful prosecution of war in the Pacific. These short-term and long-term goals will often be in conflict, and misjudgments in either direction may have dire consequences.<br/><br/>Storm Over Asia allows players to explore what might have happened if: <br/><br/>     Japan had prioritized naval expansion, even though it antagonized the United States. <br/>     Japanese admirals had focused on submarine warfare in the impending war with the Allies. <br/>     The Japanese had taken the American submarine warfare threat more seriously. <br/>     Japan had committed to jets, advanced submarines or rockets. <br/>     Synthetic oil technology had been developed by Japan. <br/>     Japan had developed a strategic bomber for to use against China &hellip; or Russia. <br/>     Japan had prepared for a direct attack on the Soviet Union, rather than first trying to eliminate the Chinese threat to is flank. <br/>     Nationalist China had defeated the Communists before Japan invaded. <br/>     Communist China had expanded its territorial base and armed forces. <br/>     The United Front had formed early, allowing China to confront Japanese aggression more effectively. <br/>     Australia and India had been better prepared for war, including by building Australian aircraft carriers or an Indian air force. <br/>     YOU had been in command.<br/><br/><br/>Storm Over Asia may be played as a separate game in a single session, with its own victory conditions, and may be played alone or in tandem with Gathering Storm, GMT&rsquo;s pre-war game in Europe. Storm Over Asia resembles Gathering Storm in many ways, and both games have a structure consistent with A World at War, allowing for a seamless transition to whatever alternate war the players planned &ndash; or stumbled into. There are many similarities between Storm Over Asia and Gathering Storm, and Gathering Storm players will have no difficulty in playing Storm Over Asia. There are also differences between the two games, such as the mechanics for combat in China, and coordinating Japanese and European Axis strategies is perhaps even more challenging before the outbreak of war than it is during A World at War (especially in turns where China draws a random event invoking &quot;German advisors&quot; as the reason for increased Chinese combat abilities). Storm Over Asia includes the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Four random events each turn, providing unlimited replay value. <br/>     Four Japanese Random Event Category Cards, which determine the type of random event that Japan will have each turn. <br/>     Economics based on tiles and activity counters, eliminating any paperwork. <br/>     Flexible Japanese mobilization rules, allowing Japan to emphasis civilian or military production &ndash; each at the expense of the other. <br/>     Unit construction which allows Japan to activate reserve units for immediate benefits, at a cost of limiting future options, and allows China, Britain and Russia to build military counters, if they feel they can afford to maintain them. <br/>     Variable Japanese, Chinese and British research, which can focus on air, naval, military, economic or intelligence projects, as well as short or long term gains. <br/>     A fast-moving diplomatic system, with each player allocating diplomatic counters each turn. Diplomatic targets are public, but the points allocated to them are not. <br/>     Japanese shipbuilding that allows a varied fleet, including the possibility of Japanese 4-factor super carriers. <br/>     Ahistorical A World at War counters, including improved Japanese armor, stronger Chinese infantry units, Chinese and Indian air units, Australian battlecruisers and light carriers, and Australian naval air units. <br/>     A dynamic combat system, which covers both the Japanese invasion of China and Russo-Japanese clashes in Manchuria and Siberia. <br/>     No dice.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Unfortunately it is impossible that you can help all sheep in your farm. The wolve are too many. However you can try your best to help your sheep by just simply send your shepherd (1 cube) to expel wolve from your farm to other farm instead. Of course no one can easily accept the wolve into their farm so each player may sent more shepherd (a cube) to expel until someone decide to take wolve (and to lost the specific sheep in their farm) but that player will earn all shepherd (cubes)in center pile.<br/><br/>Each sheep will has different victory points at the game end but you can have victory point if only you have shepherd (a cube) at the game end to match with each sheep in your farm. There are some more way to score the victory points at the game end but you need to have enough shepherd (cubes), sheeps and some special action token with some condition to earn victory points.<br/><br/>Challenging fun bidding game where most of the time are about bid to avoid the wolves hunting. But some time you have to bid for earning the special action token which can help you evacuate the sheep, steal shepherd (cubes), score special bonus victory points at the game end, etc.<br/><br/>Game is disigned to have 3 moments where situation could be swing and make it more challenge for player to optimize between Sheeps and Shepherd (cubes) in hand.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carentan, 10 - 13th June 1944 is an Operational level board-wargame which shows fierce fighting in the 1944 Normandy Campaign between Germans and Americans. In starting phase of the battle enemy armies used elite airborne formations and later less experienced mechanized forces. In effect training and determination factors were balanced. Americans achieved success because of material advantage and better coordination of combined arms actions.<br/>Could the battle outcome have been different? On tactical level German fallschirmj&auml;gers had edge, because they were masters in using urban terrain. But lack of ammo and high casualties forced them to leave Carentan. On the other hand Americans used consistently artillery support and they gained ground step by step. These battlefield elements are shown in &quot;Great Battles of Small Units&quot; system. <br/>Two scenarios are included. <br/>&quot;Purple Heart Lane&quot; depicts struggle for Carentan between enemy paratroopers. Players can use optional rule and see what would be battle finale, if troops from 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division appeared earlier on the battlefield. <br/>The scenario &quot;Battle of Bloody Gulch&quot; shows American defence of Carentan against German counterattack. In this fighting American armored units are present as well.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They are:<br/><br/>1) Cards allowing for play with up to six players.<br/><br/>2) A variant for two players: When you play the original game with two players, there are two adjustments compared to the normal game. First, you can't trade, and second, the points on the back of the cards are irrelevant. With the variant, this won't be the case anymore. Players now can trade cards with a closet and the game can end early because the babies are picked up by their parents, so both players have points to count.<br/><br/>3) A new type of card &mdash; the action card: On your turn, you can play the same cards as in the base game, but in addition you can play as many action cards as you want. With these cards you can transfer problems to other babies or trade babies with an opponent, making the game a little bit meaner and also more tactical.<br/><br/>4) A new problem &mdash; the sick baby: What will happen with a baby if you give him too much pie at a birthday party? He will become nauseous and this problem will only be solved when he vomits. The owner of the baby can choose the direction and the baby to his left or right will start crying immediately. Luckily there is medicine available, but will you be able to give it to the baby in time?<br/><br/>",

An unreliable power grid meant that these companies produced their own power (at 25 Hz) to ensure the availability of their services.  As time passed, the companies began to merge together until they became the modern Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA), only moving onto the public 60Hz grid in the 1980&rsquo;s.<br/><br/>Your role as one of these early companies is to overcome the difficulty of the limiting nature of the power generators in early Boston as you expand your network to move the citizens of Boston to and from the many historic locations in town.

Most are a mixture of both.<br/><br/>This double-sided board depicts two entirely different pitches, one for an Old World Alliance team, and the other for Underworld Denizens. On one side, you'll find a cobblestone market square, hastily cleared for a game. Barrels, bottles, tables and stalls surround the edges of the pitch, and the end zones are marked out in pink and cream checked patterns. Flip it over to find a dank cavern pitch, littered with ominously glowing fungus. Cracks in the stone have been patched up, and the remains of unfortunate victims can be seen casually strewn about. The End Zones are marked in glowing green checks.<br/><br/>The package includes two double-sided dugouts to match the two styles of pitch.

Expand your city, recruit characters, rise in economic power and complete quests to gain prestige and increase your influence. In the end only the first to finish a wonder through prestige alone is the winner. Will that be you?<br/><br/>In Imnia you take the role of a medieval lord who, in pursuit of power and glory, seeks to prove himself as a great ruler. To do this and be the first to finish building a wonder in your town you will expand your city by constructing new buildings, from basic ones, to advanced and unique, craft items which you will use to recruit characters, engage in land and sea trade to bring in wealth and exotic resources and finally fulfil quests. Through all of these you will first have to raise your influence to the highest level, 7, and finally transform your influence into coat-of-arms tokens to build a wonder and win.<br/><br/>Imnia is at it's core a race to the finish embedded within a thematic economical strategy game. Each player builds through resource management and card drafting a unique asymmetrical tableau in his player area, representing the buildings and recruited characters in his town. Each such unique tableau gives players asymmetrical powers activated with a custom worker placement mechanic.<br/><br/>",

There are two sets of instructions on every card. One set gives orders to patrolling units unaware of the player. The other set of orders is for aware units attacking the player's units.<br/><br/>Patrol instructions include: Sweeping the area for the player, Patrolling objectives, Checking suspicious behavior, etc...<br/><br/>Attack instructions include: Rushing the player, Defensive posturing, Flanking, etc...<br/><br/>Each card includes: Compass directions, Dice rolls, Player to attack, and Reactions. There are also playing card symbols on each card to be used for variable activations or objective orders in the case of multiple objectives.<br/><br/>Included with the deck and rulebook are sixteen shards matching the playing card symbols. These can be used for random setup of enemy units.<br/><br/>The rules were specifically designed for miniature games with ranged weapons.<br/><br/>For each enemy activation, the player draws a card for that enemy unit. The card gives the enemy order or orders. Sometimes requiring multiple cards to be drawn to show what direction and how far the enemy moves, and also which player to attack.<br/><br/>Hostile Tactical AI is quick to learn and gives you a good fight.

Be careful when you choose to meet the Defier of Fate: players before you may want to have a grasp of her knowledge without letting you have the same. However, something will always await for the last player.<br/><br/>All the cards in this expansion are focused on either obtaining different outcomes from meeting and following the Defier of Fate, or ignoring her, maybe even opposing her!<br/><br/>The Defier of Fate expansion pack is compatible with Solo Mode:-<br/><br/>Many cards of the set are signed with an icon: those can be used in solo mode, and following a very few rules all solo games can be played having the Defier of Fate wandering for this dying world.

Accompanying each of the army lists are suggestions for collecting, painting and wargaming with the various armies that fought in Dark Age Briton.<br/><br/>Other resources include a full colour section portraying the armies of the time and a wealth of illustrations and maps.<br/><br/>This book contains 15 exciting scenarios and two full campaigns &ndash; Mount Badon and the Raiding Season &ndash; to help you recreate the atmosphere of early medieval warfare &ndash; The Age of Arthur.<br/><br/>AGE OF ARTHUR ERRATA<br/>Despite the best endeavours of many people, a production gremlin created a couple of minor typos which sneaked through into printing. They are both in the Saxon section.<br/><br/>1. Page 50 - Saxon army list. The Saxon Gedriht (hearthguard) should be limited to 0-1 unit, like most of the other comitatus units in the book.<br/><br/>2. Page 53 - the Army of Ecgfrith, King of Northumbria. As printed, poor King Ecgfrith has a Ld of 2 and appears to cost only 10 points. This mighty Saxon warrior was, of course, somewhat more charismatic than this, and should have an Ld of 9 (as per the Saxon Cyning profile on page 49) and cost 210 points!<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Warhammer Ancient Battles<br/><br/><br/>",

Most of the cards also gives money.<br/><br/>The game plays essentially with a worker placement system. After selecting the actions and perform them (each player plays 2 workers per turn), the discs used to do so are placed under the track establishing the new turn order (the more to the right a player disc is, the first he will replace it the next turn).<br/><br/>There are 7 main actions to choose. Some of them can be used by more than 1 player. In the city of Gemville players not only prospect in the mine (a bag full of gems), but they are forced to use the black market, use the trading market or even buy gems in the town jewelry to fulfill their current needs!<br/><br/>Gemville plays in 20 minutes per player.<br/><br/>",

It outclassed everything it met but there was only one (think of the SF classic, Ogre, but on the waters this time).<br/><br/>Paul Stuhlfaut with Under Ten Flags starts early in 1939 when the German merchant raider Atlantis made its way into the South Atlantic to sink and capture Allied cargo vessels. Its crew used their skill in disguising the appearance of the vessel to aid its encounters or avoid enemy warships. The journey of the raider Atlantis lasted for over 600 days and traveled over 100,000 miles.<br/><br/>Steven Cunliffe with XXI, a solitaire game set in 1943 that challenges the player (acting as both Speer and D&ouml;nitz) to organize and complete construction of a fleet (or at least &ldquo;enough&rdquo;) of the new German Type XXI submarine. However this new sub is far larger, more complex and more expensive, and requires much more manpower and scarce resources than previous submarines. Just a few of these new Type XXIs will do nothing. Only a radical transformation in shipbuilding techniques to mass produce the design - and not giving in to setbacks - will enable this &ldquo;wonder weapon&rdquo; to arrive in time....<br/><br/>Paul Rohrbaugh with First Strike looks at, well, the &quot;first strike&quot; by British airplanes. On Christmas Day, 1914, float planes were brought near land by the earliest &quot;seaplane tenders&quot; and turned loose on an &quot;air reconnaissance&quot; by planes which just happened to be carrying bombs and looking for Zeppelin sheds. There was also hope of luring out the German fleet, and an unexpected result of having the British naval force attacked by German airplanes.<br/><br/>Sea Monsters! and the 2018 ATO Magazine Annual<br/><br/>Maps - Four full color assorted size mapsheets<br/>Counters - 420 full color die-cut counters<br/>Rules length - From 8 to 12 pages each<br/>Charts and tables - 4<br/>Complexity - Medium<br/>Playing time - Varies by title, from 2 to 4 hours per game<br/>How challenging is it solitaire? - Varies by title, Excellent to Poor<br/><br/>Designers - Paul Rohrbaugh, Steve Cunliffe, and Paul Stuhlfaut,<br/>Development - Russ Lockwood<br/>Graphic Design - Mark Mahaffey<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>For hundreds of years, the Dutch maintained dominion over a vast empire of overseas possessions. By the early 1900&rsquo;s, many of these territories had been lost to Great Britain, however one of significant import remained: the East Indies, which would later become modern day Indonesia. Little Holland controlled the resources of an island empire of some 40 million people, rich in the resources &ndash; oil, rubber, tin and other metals - that would ultimately drive the industrial economies of the 20th century.<br/><br/>Covetous eyes watched the development of this region with interest. Japan made numerous inroads with trade missions, while more radical voices called for outright conquest, Germany expressed interest in obtaining island bases there (if not overall acquisition), while Britain stood by, intent that no other nation which could pose a threat to her interests should gain control the islands. Fears of Japanese aggression led the Dutch to consider a vastly expanded Koninklijke Marine with modern dreadnoughts to defend their prize.<br/><br/>Dutch East Indies is a 64-page book supplement for the Great War at Sea series, focusing on battles which could have and in some cases did take place in and around these islands over the period 1914-1917. Conflicts between the navy the Dutch considered but never built and Japanese invaders (and others) are explored, along with historical battles and hypothetical situations arising as the principal maritime combatants of the Great War, England and Germany, struggled for control of the seas. There are 35 scenarios, or separate game situations, as well as background articles presenting the history of this Dutch territory, the politics of the Great Powers around it, and the ships that fought or might have fought there. In addition, a campaign game is provided, for those wishing to examine the challenges and surprises that would have faced Dutch and IJN planners in a 1916-1917 Japanese invasion of the East Indies.<br/><br/>This supplement contains no pieces or maps; ownership of Pacific Crossroads, Jutland, Cruiser Warfare and the operational maps from Strike South (from the Second World War at Sea series) is required to play the majority of the battle and operational scenarios, while Mediterranean and Dreadnoughts are needed to enjoy them all.<br/><br/>",

Letters that may or may not have deadly anthrax in them!<br/><br/>Players will do their best to push these letters off on each other in an effort to avoid opening their own, but as the letters pile up, so does the suspense because at some point cards are going to start making people open them, and maybe even make everyone open them at once!<br/><br/>As players are eliminated the deck and the letters thin themselves out making the game more aggressive and speeding up player demise until only one player is left alive to tell the harrowing tale. Making them the winner!<br/><br/>Yes, there is player elimination, but Pass the Anthrax is so fast that you can play a 12 player game in less than 30 minutes making it perfect for parties, in-between games, waiting for people to show up, and with super-fast set up and take town it even works for those times when no one wants to get into a really involved game.<br/><br/>It's easy to learn, easy to teach, and even easy for non-gamers to pick up, all that combined with the short playtime and the fact that the whole game fits into a box about the size of a poker deck makes it great for travel!

It also makes different players more powerful and different abilities and cards much more useful. It actually gives it the feel of the real pro tour in that, if you play with the same character across each of the courses, you will be faced with significantly different challenges. There is tons of OB. You've got to do some serious strategery to get through unscathed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Coin Rugby is a dexterity game popular in Australia and New Zealand combining elements of Penny Hockey (aka Penny Football) and Shove Ha'penny. It is played on a rectangular table between two players with a single round coin (usually a 20 cent piece).<br/><br/>The table represents the field of play in a Rugby match, with the ends furthest from each other representing the try-lines. Players attempt to flick or shove the coin from one end of the table to the other in three moves. They begin their turn by placing the coin so that part of it overhangs the table at the end closest to them. They then hit it with the palm of their hand for their first move. If they shove the coin completely off the table, their opponent receives the coin and begins their turn as described. If the coin is still completely on the table after three moves their opponent begins their turn from wherever the coin ended up on the table. If however, the coin is shoved into a position where it partly overhangs the opposite end of the table, they may attempt to score a try. <br/>To successfully score a try, a player must flick the overhanging coin into the air and catch it with one hand. Doing so will score 5 or 4 points (as per Rugby Union or Rugby League). The player may then attempt to kick a conversion, which is worth 3 or 2 points respectively. Their opponent must form the shape of a rugby goal with thumbs and forefingers. This may be done in the air or with their fists on the edge of the table, at the behest of the scoring player, but this must be done fairly and without moving once set. Then the player attempting the conversion spins the coin on the table. To attempt the &quot;kick&quot; they must place both fists on the table beyond the spinning coin and then catch it between their thumbs. With the coin between their thumbs they must then propel it over the goal made by their opponent. Regardless of outcome the opponent then receives the coin and begins their turn. <br/>Play can be timed, end when a certain score is reached by one player, or end with a &quot;mercy rule&quot;, i.e., an agreed points differential.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hyperion is the first Hunt Mission and will see our heroes pursuing the fiery Titan in a mini-side-campaign that culminates in the death fight against Hyperion itself!<br/><br/>The Hunt Missions are special Boss fights where the heroes will have to contend with a lethal opponent managed by special Action Cards. Each card describes the Enemy's action and its Action Point (AP) cost. Actions can be attacks, movements, or special abilities and the Heroes will have to learn to know the moves of their prey if they want to have a hope of victory. The Hunt Missions can be faced several times so that every time you will have the possibility to obtain new reagents for crafting.<br/><br/>Hyperion can also be used in Black Rose Wars as a new and powerful Asymmetrical Mage! A Player will be able to control Hyperion, using a basic deck consisting of 6 Unique Spells and composing their deck during the game as usual.<br/><br/>Hyperion will also be equipped with 3 copies of his Personal Spell and will be able to change form, transforming through one of his spells into his Burning Legion composed of 3 Myrmidons. Depending on his form, he will have different advantages and disadvantages and will use his 3 new Lodge Rooms to teleport or as a Cell for when he re-enters the game after being defeated.<br/><br/>Also in this set, you will find 2 new Forgotten Spells that will allow you to summon Hyperion or the 3 Myrmidons during your standard BRW games.<br/><br/>-description from Kickstarter<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Knockouts and Tapouts: The Mixed Martial Arts Card Game allows players to each customize a fighter in mere moments and then use strategies and tactics of their own design to engage in a fast-paced, easy-to-play, mixed martial arts contest.<br/><br/>Each player gets to quickly and easily choose and customize the kind of fighter that they want to be. You can make a striker, grappler or a balance of both, then choose your special styles and abilities and you're ready to go. You play through 3 quick phases. Each player rolls a die and adds any bonus they have to determine which of them is the most mobile on the current turn, then the player that wins mobility moves a marker to show the posture and range between the fighters. (Short Range, Long Range, Full Guard, Half Guard etc...) He then plays a card vs his opponent. The card could be a punch, a kick, an elbow, a neck hold, or any number of various special moves. You roll dice and use your fighter's strengths combined with his position to instantly determine the success level of the attack. Your opponent then does the same to you. You each then refill your hand and attempt to recover from any damage you may currently have. You keep repeating the process until the round ends (the draw deck is empty).<br/><br/>The really exciting thing is that the game can end at any moment, just like in a real mixed martial arts match. If you catch your opponent with a devastating strike or lock in a powerful hold, the match ends instantly in a knockout or a tapout. Both players are on the edge of their seats throughout the whole game knowing that it could be all over at any second. You can also wear down your foe until the ref stops the fight because one fighter is unable to intelligently defend himself (He's taken too much damage). Another way to win is that successful attack cards set aside during each round count as points from the &quot;judges&quot; to determine a winner if the fight &quot;Goes the distance.&quot;<br/><br/>You can play the game over and over again because you can design a unique fighter every time you play. There are so many different cards that no two matches are ever the same. Most matches between experienced players are finished within about 10 or 15 minutes, so you get to play multiple matches per game session. Alot of attention was put into writing the instructions. Only one person really needs to read them. The game comes with a Quick Reference Card that you can use to teach somebody how to play quickly. The game is designed to fit into a pocket. You can fit the whole game into a little plastic sandwich bag or one of those little plastic boxes that you buy to hold sports trading cards.<br/><br/>Each match is decided between 2 players, but the game is ideal for multi-player tournaments. Having multiple copies of the game (One for each pair of players) is recommended but not absolutely necessary because of the short playing time and the game's rare quality of being so exciting to watch even if your not in the current match being played.<br/><br/>What you get...<br/>The game is simply a 90 card deck. 2 cards are not used for playing. 8 of the cards create a full color easy-to-use play chart. 1 card contains cutout counters (but you can use anything for counters). 8 of the cards (along with the counters) are used to create your fighter. 8 cards contain the instructions (English only). 2 cards provide a quick reference of the instructions for each player during play. 61 cards make up a playing deck packed with exciting B&amp;W photos of all your favourite MMA techniques. You need 6 regular six-sided dice (not normally included).<br/><br/>",

The misguided Blakists still adhere to the old ways that shrouded technology in a veil of mysticism for hundreds of years. While the Inner Sphere was caught up in the Jade Falcon attack on Coventry, the Word of Blake struck Terra  quickly and without mercy, using deep-cover agents to cripple us from within. From this terrible blow, ComStar&mdash;and Terra&mdash;may never recover.<br/><br/>- From the diary of Sharilar Mori, Primus of ComStar<br/><br/>The lies of Focht's ComStar have gone unanswered long enough. The time has come to drive the heretics from the cradle of humanity. Then the purifying light of Blake's True Vision will shine again on Terra, the gleaming gem set at the heart of the Inner Sphere. Then all will know that the true ComStar, the Word of Blake, has returned to guide them through the darkness of ignorance.<br/>- From an address to the Word of Blake Militia by Precentor Demona Aziz<br/><br/>The Fall of Terra is a BattleTech scenario pack that describes the struggle for control of the Earth between the warring factions of ComStar. Sixteen scenarios and special weather rules recreate the major battles of this campaign. Also included is a sourcebook section describing the history and features of 31st-century Terra.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This scenario pack is the second one to feature the Com Guard, this time fighting their opposite number.  The scenarios in the pack cover a range of geographical areas drawn from around the world, and there are various weather rules covering areas such as fighting in deep snow to make life more interesting for those playing.  The scenario pack finishes with a reasonable amount of information for setting follow-up games on Earth after the events covered, and in addition to these genreal game rules also adds profiles for a new (and fairly unexciting) vehicle and two new 'Mechs. The fact that this scenario pack is set on Earth makes it entertaining in it's own right, and it's one of the scenario packs available as an electronic download from the current licence holder.<br/><br/>",

In Der gro&szlig;e Reibach, every player turns into the CEO of a big bank, trying to cash in as much money as their questionable means allow. The goal of the game is to be the first have 80 TSD in the bank.<br/><br/>The basic trade for these banks is customer business. Each bank has three branches where they can look after different customers and try to cash in on their investments.&nbsp;You earn your costumers&rsquo; trust through persuasive bank advisors. If the trust is established you will fill your pockets with quick cash, but as soon as the trust is lost the costumers will flee and the money with them.<br/><br/>To make sure the other banks won&rsquo;t do too well, there are plenty of action cards you can use to influence and manipulate the competition. Lawyers, for example, sue the most capable employees of the other banks, the black bloc destroys entire branches, and the critical shareholder worries the investors of your competitors. On the other hand, of course, one's own bank can also be improved by incidentally food speculation, attracting rating agencies or allowing brokers to work for you. With over 50 different cards and a total card number of 185 cards there are numerous options available to pave the path to the big money.<br/><br/>The own pocket is represented in the game by a small cloth bag, so that the competition cannot see your fortune and nobody can be certain to win the game until the very end. Suspense until the big finale is guaranteed.<br/><br/>The turn-based game is characterized by having a very high level of interaction between the players and which allows to have a great impact on the moves and opportunities of other players. With a duration of 90 to 180 minutes (depending on the number of players), there are enough opportunities to make up for any financial arrears. Each turn you hold, six action points can be used. You can split them up between buying new cards, playing the cards in your hand, and activating cards already placed. You control the markets and gameplay through your own behavior, so that no match is the same and different tactics can be profitable.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

After finding another gateway, this one through both time and space, he has found an unknown world and sends for help. Your quest is to find him and bring him home. To do this you will have to improve your ship, bring on the right crew, and succeed in a series of missions that will lead you to fulfill your ultimate goal - find John Carter!<br/><br/>At the start of each round, each player draws 5 cubes from a draw bag.  This is the player's crew. They may consist of unskilled workers, merchants, officers, mechanics, smugglers, navigators, and gunners. Each player then places a player token on one of several spaces on the board.  They may go to the academy to improve a crew member's skill (gain new cubes) or recruit a specialist, to the market to get fuel, crystals, or money. These items are used to fulfil missions and trade in the black market. They may go to the cantina to gain a smuggler--they could take a smuggler to the black market to gain any good. They may go to the shipyard to improve their space craft. Or they may choose to fulfil a mission.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to gain the most points from their ship, full sets of crew members, sets of crystals, sets of specialists, and missions.  Each mission is in a mission row and the player to have the most completed missions in a row also gets a bonus. Each mission also has been assigned by an agency. Gaining multiple agency mission tiles also gives a bonus. The game ends when John Carter is found.  All players will finish the current round and the game ends.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

These winter-hardened tribes would not have stood for loss without a fight. Surely this aggression must have been committed by only the most powerful adversaries. Some say they are the fathers of dragons. Others, dormant titans awakened from deep beneath the earth. It will require the greatest of Valorfall&rsquo;s Ether Mages to answer this challenge. Etchinstone calls for every elemental guild&rsquo;s best Mage to travel northward--to glory or defeat.<br/><br/>Northvale is an 18-card expansion for Dragons of Etchinstone. The player takes the role of one of four powerful Ether Mages, one from each guild. There are four major guilds in Valorfall (red, blue, gray and yellow), each with their own school of thought on how best to wield the elements.<br/><br/>You get the chance to pit your chosen Mage against a new landscape, progressing from the brutal dangers of the Severed Seaboard to the open--but deadly--horizons of the Whispering Fields. Then, navigate the dark terrain and evil secrets of the Forgotten Foothills. And, finally, traverse the icy mountain terrain and unmatched power of the Elementals in the unforgiving Northern region of Northvale. Then, if you are brave enough, face one of four terrifying new bosses.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For shame, for shame, light infantry. I never saw you retreat before. Form! Form! It&rsquo;s only a scouting probe!&rdquo; <br/>--General Howe, a little before 7:00 AM upon seeing, out of the fog, the headlong retreat of the 2nd Light Infantry pickets. Moments later he and his staff came under sustained American artillery fire.<br/> A Barbarous Ground is a simulation of the battle fought on October 4th, 1777, at the crossroads village of Germantown between the Continental Army under General George Washington and the British Army under Lord Cornwallis.  The British had split their Army after occupying Philadelphia, and Washington believed he was presented with an excellent opportunity with defeating the invaders in detail. While the initial American attack succeeded splendidly, the morning fog, smoke, a determined stand by the British 40th Regiment at Chew House, and greater British experience in battle allowed the defending forces time to regroup and counter-attack; snatching victory from the jaws of defeat. Can you do better?<br/> A Barbarous Ground uses an interactive sequence of play that activates formations, and their subordinate units, by the types of orders (Attack, Advance, Stand, Reserve) they have been issued. Combat is of two types, fire and melee, and both individual unit and larger formation morale figure prominently in the game&rsquo;s outcome. Rules include ones for leaders and variable reinforcements. Scenarios cover the morning&rsquo;s &ldquo;opening round&rdquo; in which both sides were surprised to discover a fight would occur here, the afternoon&rsquo;s bloody, climatic slugfest in which the American offensive was spent, and the British managed to snatch a degree of victory from the jaws of defeat.<br/> Terrain scale is about 200 yards per hex<br/>Infantry units and cavalry units are mostly regiments, artillery units are battalions. Each strength point represents 250 men.<br/>Each turn is about 30 minutes. <br/> Playing time is about 2.5 to 3 hours for the AM and PM scenarios, about 6+ hours for the day-long battle scenario. Although designed for two players, A Barbarous Ground can easily be played solitaire.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "K&ouml;nigsberg &acute;45( # 104-1 ), is a boardgame covering the Soviet attack on East Prussia in 1945.<br/><br/>The game handles the 20 first days of the attack starting on the 13th of January 1945. The 3rd Belorussian Front under command of Cherniakhovsky launches an attack into the northeast of East Prussia while the 2nd Belorussian Front, commanded by Rokossovsky, one day later starts an attack from the south east. However, Army Group Mitte, under the command of Reinhardt, puts up an astonishing defence desperatly pushing the Soviets back.<br/>The time is however on the Soviet side and when the defence finally crumbles there is nothing left to withstand the Soviet troops to ravage the country.<br/><br/>K&ouml;nigsberg &acute;45 is taught in 30 minutes and easy to digest yet a challenge even for the more experienced players. It is built around the same system of rules that shaped Stargard Solstice, Königsberg '45 and Army Group Narwa and utilizes a Command chit-pull system to activate HQ, which in turn allow their controlled combat units to move and attack.<br/>Each turn is two days and the game has 10 turns.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     50 x 70cm-size map<br/>     280 die-cut counters<br/>     1 six-sided die<br/>     Rules<br/>     Box<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "WINGEN-SUR-MODER, FRANCE, 4 January 1945: Shortly before the crack of dawn on 4 January sleeping American soldiers were suddenly awakened by what some on the scene described as &ldquo;the most intensive machine-gun and automatic weapon fire that any had ever heard.&rdquo; Disoriented GIs awoke to the sudden outburst of fire but there was no panic. German forces pushed out of the Low Vosges forests to capture Wingen-sur-Moder, situated along the road net needed for Operation Nordwind. The attacking enemy forces struck Wingen at the first light of day and rapidly moved through the village. In the confusion that followed, Company A lost communications with Companies B and C, and for a time the Company was without radio contact with the Battalion CP in the Kirchberg. Within the company perimeter confusion made it difficult for the platoon leaders and platoon sergeants to get their men organized. Nearly every squad was on its own. Their reaction to the sudden attack was left to the judgment of the individual squad leaders. By 0900 hours the Germans had captured and occupied the town, the high ground to the northeast of town, and established a bridgehead on the south bank of the Moder River. They immediately went about establishing a perimeter defense around the village then prepared to continue their attack southward toward Saverne.<br/><br/>During the first days of January 1945 German forces pushed out of the Low Vosges forests to capture the towns that lay along the snow-covered route of attack. One of these towns was Wingen, along the Moder River. American units there were initially caught by surprise as battle-hardened troopers from the 6th SS Mountain Division stormed in and captured the town. American reinforcements were soon pouring in from the west and the south and despite bitter fighting, by January 5th the German offensive had been brought to a standstill. Lacking exits from the Vosges, planned armored reserves stood idle and Operation Nordwind ended in failure. Wingen sits in a small valley along the Moder River between Bitche to the north and Saverne to the south. Described in the following bucolic terms, &ldquo;...the village and the surrounding area looked very much like a winter scene one might expect to find on a Christmas card back home. Smoke rising from a few chimneys made the houses appear warm and inviting...&rdquo; Wingen would erupt on 3 January 1945 and become the focal-point of Operation Nordwind.<br/><br/>This module consists of eight scenarios, all playable on the Wingen-sur-Moder historical map. The map seeks to recreate this wooded region, and specifically allow for the investigation of combat problems inherent to a built-up area with river, bridges, and buildings laid out realistically in a manner unlike that which can be depicted on geomorphic boards. Welcome to the NORDIC TWILIGHT*, a map-based VARIANT module that depicts the fierce fighting in the Low Vosges by the 6th SS Mountain Division during Operation Nordwind. NORDIC TWILGIHT contains eight scenarios, all playable on the new map included. You also two copies of two new die-cut counter sheets and an expanded 28 page SR and historical notes booklet. Bring your own ASLRB, markers and Americans and have at it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a card game for 2-5 players. Each player takes on the role of a king trying to expand one's kingdom (represented by cards placed on one's own area) meanwhile suppressing others to expand by imprisoning opponents' cards.  The game finishes in 5 rounds and the player running the biggest kingdom wins.  Each round is made up of 5 phases, within which 2 phases are either of diplomatic or military actions (which correspond to either the diplomatic or military numbers shown on the cards), when most of the time is spent on playing cards from ones' hands.  Based on the results of battles or political struggles, rewards (be able to expand) or punishment (lose a piece of land) will be given to the kings.  New logics are introduced in this poker-like game such as King's cards, imprisoning, alliance, stewardship, etc.  The basic rule is also expandable with cards of national strategies (LCG), guest cards, professional cards, treasure cards (CCG), or small DBG varieties upcoming.<br/><br/>The first version of the game is based on the history of the Warring States in China, circa 276 B.C.<br/><br/>",

Building on the momentum of their victory over the Jade Falcons on Coventry, the Great House leaders create a Star League Constitution, resurrecting with a pen what they had failed to accomplish through the force of arms - a new Star League. With the might of all the Houses apparently united after hundreds of years of warfare, the members of this fragile union hatch a desperate plan to end the Clan threat once and for all - the complete destruction of a Clan.<br/><br/>The Dragon Roars is a BattleTech scenario pack that describes the brutal conflict between forces of the newly constituted Star League Defense Force - made up of a coalition army from every Great House - and the savage Smoke Jaguars. Detailed descriptions and maps follow each wave of this titanic struggle as the Inner Sphere sweeps into the Smoke Jaguar Occupation Zone. Twelve BattleTech scenarios and one BattleForce 2 scenario allows players to actively participate one of the largest conflicts in human history.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This scenario pack is effectively the first in a two-volume series, the concluding volume being BattleTech: Twilight of the Clans. The rules specific to this campaign are also useful for self-generated campaigns as they provide detail on such things as installing Clan Tech in Inner Sphere 'Mechs as field upgrades.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players are building Wild West towns by purchasing cards for their player boards. They are trying to improve their available actions and get most victory points. While all actions from the player boards eventually get executed, the order of action execution is usually not easy to predict. Players will have to place cards carefully to try and maximize their chances!<br/><br/>Every round, after a roll of two dice, all players execute two actions on their boards based on the roll result. Indicated actions get marked so that they cannot repeat until a reset happens. If in a subsequent round, the action in given row is already marked, player marks and executes the first available action to the right. When a row is fully marked, player removes all the markers from the row to start over!<br/><br/>During the game, players are often allowed to mark and execute additional actions on their boards to get more resources and possibilities. Also, while players move along the score track during the game, they reach different regions with nearby towns. Trading with a town is another way of managing the tableau and scoring points, but sometimes, one will also have to face a villain!<br/><br/>Once the game is over, the one who has collected the best set of cards with buildings, animals, and scoring symbols is the winner!<br/><br/>Follow West Story on Gamefound:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://gamefound.com/en/projects/smart-flamingo/west-story\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://gamefound.com/en/projects/smart-flamingo/west-story</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chroma Arcana is a tactical card game set in a fantasy world. Players take on the roles of powerful mages, using their knowledge of the arcane arts to outmanoeuvre and defeat their opponents. Each mage has access to a unique combination of Spells based on their chosen colours of magic, allowing for a diverse range of gameplay options and strategies. The goal of the game is to reduce your rival's health to zero. On your turn, you can place Spell cards into your Spellbook. Then, you can discard cards of a matching colour to charge those Spells up. Once a Spell is charged up, it must be cast.<br/><br/>Spells can be instant-effect Bursts, Minions that provide a benefit for a handful of turns, powerful Edicts that apply a temporary effect, or trap-like Wards that remain until their trigger condition is met.<br/><br/>There are also item cards that you play straight from your hand, such as Potions that counter rival Spells or Arcana that super-charge your own.<br/><br/>At the end of setup, you will have selected an Ego (your character identity), a Main Colour (along with a powerful Sigil and a well-practiced Rote), and two Secondary Colours. This should be all you need to battle it out!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

As a pirate captain, either as a full pirate with no allegiances or one with an allegiance to England, France, Spain, or the Netherlands, you control the fate of your pirate band while attempting to win the game by accumulating fame, infamy, and popularity. You do this through acquiring new ships to be part of your pirate fleet, attacking merchant ships (piracy), raiding ports, and trading booty seized in attacks on ships and ports for gold. There are also 1-4 &quot;AI&quot; pirates who have their own motivations and desire for fame/infamy and booty!<br/><br/>The game consists of a map of the Caribbean with the famous ports of the era marked on it. These will have their own defense and trade values which are unique to each game played. The five players bid take a historical pirate card, which will have a unique ability and, for AI players, rules for how it behaves. Players secretly vote for an action and then carry out those actions: Piracy, Raiding ports, Building new ships, Trading.<br/><br/>The game is especially suitable for solitaire play, and has optional rules to accommodate a fifth player, if required.<br/><br/>",

If you aren't happy with the options available, you can always use a card for its Secondary action which means you can directly make a card into apples and wood instead of having to use other cards.<br/>(3) As the cidery owner, you are always able to do an action each round yourself instead of playing a card. These actions are slightly less efficient as you are not as good at the job, but this unique mechanic means you can, at the right time, use your owner meeple to select a 'core action' to be completed.<br/><br/>Each player will strive to efficiently produce cider in bottles or more valuable cider in barrels and sell it at a variety of themed Distributors as efficiently as possible. Upgrades to the innovatively designed Storehouse will also allow for more efficiencies and the winning player will earn the most prestige over the course of the game.<br/><br/>",

After initial successes, the outnumbered Austro-Hungarian forces fell back with severe losses.<br/><br/>Fall of Empires is a stand-alone game in the Infantry Attacks series, our World War One equivalent to the long-running Panzer Grenadier series. Units are companies and squadrons, and the sixty scenarios represent actions from the opening battles of 1914 in on the Eastern Front between the Russian and Austro-Hungarian armies.<br/><br/>Forces include the Austro-Hungarian Common Army's infantry, mountain troops, artillery and cavalry. The Austrian Landwehr and Hungarian Honv&eacute;ds&eacute;g, the regular armies of the two halves of the Dual Monarchy, also have their own infantry, mountain troops, artillery and cavalry. And the Bosniaken, the fierce Muslim regiments recruited in Bosnia-Hercegovina, appear in their own colors as well. Against that multi-national array, the Imperial Russian Army brings its own infantry, cavalry, Cossacks and Plastuns.<br/><br/>There are six semi-rigid mapboards, the same type found in Panzer Grenadier games.

        "description": "From the Avalanche Press website:<br/><br/>In December 1912, Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy renewed their 30-year-old military pact known as the Triple Alliance. In the months that followed, staff officers from all three fleets prepared detailed plans for operations against the French and British fleets in the Mediterranean in case of war. Yet when war came in August 1914, Italy refused to join her Alliance partners and those plans would never be used.<br/><br/>What if Italy had honored her Alliance obligations, and joined the Germans and Austrians in a naval war against Britain and France? What if the Triple Alliance plans had been put into operation, with the Austrian and Italian fleets combining to challenge the French and British? The Great War at Sea in the Mediterranean is no longer confined to the Adriatic Sea, but now rages across the entire Mediterranean basin.<br/><br/>Triple Alliance is a book supplement for the Great War at Sea series based on those plans. It is not a complete game; ownership of Mediterranean and Dreadnoughts (and only Mediterranean and Dreadnoughts) is required to enjoy all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>The book includes 90 new scorchless, sootless laser-cut playing pieces. There are several versions of the Austrian battleship Radetzky, both the small dreadnought and full dreadnought variations presented by her design team in 1907. The all-big-gun battleship originally proposed for the Italian Navy by designer Vittorio Cuniberti is included, along with other ships cancelled for financial reasons. And the French receive a full class of unusual battleships proposed but never built, that carry the big guns of a dreadnought but also the not-quite-as-big guns of a semi-dreadnought.<br/><br/>And there are some pieces to replace armored cruisers and semi-dreadnoughts from our Mediterranean game, with gunnery ratings more accurately reflecting their capabilities. Plus new seaplane pieces rated for use with the aircraft rules that began to appear in Great War at Sea games after publication of the most recent edition of Mediterranean.<br/><br/>The thirty scenarios study the Triple Alliance war plan in a story all their own, following the outbreak of war and the conduct of operations as the joint planning staff foresaw possible events. The scenarios follow a single story arc, but also present a study of the Triple Alliance&rsquo;s strengths and weaknesses. It&rsquo;s a similar approach to that in High Seas Fleet, but with its own story line.<br/><br/>",

Its stats are Movement 4, Combat 1.<br/><br/>Oubliette:<br/>For 1 AP, the Disciple can flip face down the room he is standing on. All tokens in this room, including the Disciple, are placed face down on the room. All markers are removed from this room (including open or broken portcullis marker). Golem marker or other similar markers return to their owner. Wounded characters remain wounded. The &quot;forgotten&quot; room cannot be revealed again during the turn it was flipped. All rules concerning revealing a room apply to this room again.<br/><br/>The Disciple was given out at Dungeon Twister tournaments during the tournament season in 2007.

Face his challenge and re-write history.<br/><br/>Luck, luck, luck! Bonaparte was lucky to reach Egypt without being intercepted by Nelson, lucky to not catch the plague when visiting the French hospital in Jaffa, lucky to get back to France without being caught by the British: or was it all skill? This game examines the influence of luck and skill on the timing of events during Bonaparte&rsquo;s adventures in the East.<br/><br/>Bonaparte started off lucky; a storm blew strong Mistral winds from the 12th May to 19th May 1798, delaying his departure. However, luckily, the very same winds drove Nelson and the British blockading squadrons from their stations, allowing him to slip away unnoticed.<br/><br/>In Bonaparte's Eastern Empire you take the role of either the French, who must sail their fleets to Egypt and fight to conquer the Egyptian lands, or the Allies, who must prevent the French incursion by expelling or destroying them.<br/><br/>The Limits of Glory series examines the effect of 'skill and luck' on the commanders present in a campaign. A Glory rating is attributed to all the significant participants in the campaign, made up from the skill they exhibited and the luck from which they benefited. Players must make difficult decisions as to when to use their commanders Glory to mitigate the situation on the board to their advantage by attempting to change unfavourable events as the campaign unfolds.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Emperor Nero wants you to sponsor games in the Colosseum, where gladiators will engage in thrilling battles for the enjoyment of the crowds. It's up to you to build ludi, where gladiators can be trained in one of the two competing schools, and arenas, where they can practice. You'll then assign the gladiators to the Colosseum to fight! All the excitement has also brought forth new advisors who offer enticing rewards for those who dare to bribe them...<br/><br/>The Rome &amp; Roll: Gladiators expansion introduces a new Colosseum sideboard, gladiator dice, new shared advisors, a neutral foreman, and new blueprints, God's Favour, and Nero's Bonus cards. Gladiators also adds a fifth asymmetric character class &mdash; the Rudiarius, a retired gladiator who has earned their freedom. A veteran of the Colosseum, the Rudiarius can call in favors with his old masters to get ahead.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Will you perish there in the hinterlands or will you make it out with more than your life?<br/><br/>There is something out there. Something worth seeking for, but it will be up to you to determine what precisely that is. Maybe it&rsquo;s purpose. Maybe it&rsquo;s knowledge. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just nothing but trouble.<br/><br/>But it&rsquo;s not up to me. So, go on. Get out there and seek, before someone or something makes the decisions for you.<br/><br/>Welcome to Rove, an immersive campaign adventure for 1-4 players. Explore the high fantasy world of Chorus, a wild and vibrant planet full of flora, fauna, and other things&hellip; that all want to kill or eat you. Rovers, a loosely-formed collective of sojourners and adventurers, struggle to maintain a tenuous balance. The natural predators of Chorus roam the wilds, threatening to prevent the people of Chorus from thriving.<br/><br/>As Rovers, players will adventure through a branching story filled with consequence, where choices affect both individual adventures and the state of the world. But beware, the paths left behind don&rsquo;t fade away. They linger and fester until what was once the promise of a threat evolves into something else entirely.<br/><br/>Along the way, players will unlock new skills, equipment, and classes in strategic, turn-based combat. Adversaries will not stand idly by, though, and let Rovers traverse Chorus without hindrance. A unique behavior table will dictate how adversaries react based on the state of the encounter. This extra dimension of gameplay demands more careful consideration from the players without increasing upkeep. Spend less time managing the game and more time playing it. And Rove&rsquo;s inspired skill card mechanic makes learning the game easy but provides complex strategic decisions for even the most veteran of players.<br/><br/>Master these mechanics and work together as a team. It might just be enough for you Rovers to leave a lasting mark in a world that forgets quickly and forgives rarely.<br/><br/>",

You can choose from over 40 courses together with their Weather Modifiers. A Championship season of 12 races for men and 10 for women is suggested, so with each race taking about 2 1/2 hours playing time such a season would take around 60 hours to complete - well within the realms of possibility for many replay gamers if feedback from you is anything to go by.<br/><br/>The aim has been to try to recreate the way in which actual Marathon events develop, with small groups of runners breaking away off the front of the main pack, and others losing ground off the back.<br/><br/>We recommend 40 to 70 starters, although the system can cope with larger numbers if necessary, and we deal with the race in 1 kilometer stages, so it would not be sensible or enjoyable to require a dice roll for every competitor each kilometer. With a field of 70 that would entail around 3000 dice rolls!<br/><br/>So we only concern ourselves with identifying those runners within each Group (in game terms a Group consists of any number of runners from one upwards occupying a single 10-second space of our Endless Track) who need their Rating checked for that particular kilometer of the race to see whether they stay with their present Group, or make a forward or backward movement - that is gain or lose around 10 seconds on their Group over this kilometer.<br/><br/>National, European, Commonwealth, and Asian Championships can be run within the context of the main season's Championship, plus a Team Championship on a race-by-race or full season basis.<br/><br/>",

All die rolls are made on a single d6 (with high numbers indicating a favorable result), modifiers are kept to a minimum, and realism is achieved using scenarios rather than &quot;point value&quot; forces.  It is our belief that the man is more important than the weapon he uses, consequently you will not find endless tables of technical data on various rifles etc., only generic weapon types.

What followed was an epic seven-day struggle with the defending airborne troops besieged by four German divisions.<br/><br/>On 26 December the siege was broken by the arrival of the American 4th Armored Division and a few days later the Americans went on the attack.<br/><br/>However, the Germans were not done. On 31 December Hitler launched the last German offensive in the west, Operation Nordwind. German divisions along the Lorraine front attacked into the old French Maginot Line where the Americans had dug in. With many of their reserves sent north to face the Ardennes offensive, the Americans were taken by surprise.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This two player trick-taking game combines elements of German Whist and Watten and offers scope for strategic play.  At the start of play, one player chooses a trump suit and another chooses &quot;supertrump,&quot; i.e. chooses a single rank of cards (two through Ace) that becomes part of the trump suit and beats all other trumps.<br/><br/>The game is played in two stages.  After each of the first 13 tricks the players replenish their hands from a draw deck; each trick won at this stage counts for 1 point.  The second set of 13 tricks is then played out, with each trick won during this stage counting for 2 points.<br/><br/>Detailed rules can be found in a forum posting below.<br/><br/>",

The South seeks to harass Northern commerce and fend off attempts to isolate and capture the great fleet base at Norfolk.<br/><br/>The Confederate fleet adds its oldest ships still active: the locally-designed and -built coast-defense ships of the Davis class and the British-built pre-dreadnoughts of the Chesapeake class. The United States Navy gets additional dreadnoughts: with a hostile neighbor so close by, battleship classes expand to four ships rather than just two.<br/><br/>A strategy built around commerce raiding has driven the Confederate Navy to specialize in armored cruisers to raid Yankee shipping. Unable to afford the big, expensive battle cruisers introduced by their British allies, the Confederates have worked to build fast armored cruisers that can overwhelm Union cruisers and run away from Union battleships.<br/><br/>CSN: Plan Blue is a supplement for the Great War at Sea series, based on battles that never happened. It is not a complete game: Ownership of U.S. Navy Plan Red, Jutland and Confederate States Navy (and only those three items) is necessary to play all of the ten scenarios included.<br/><br/>CSN: Plan Blue includes 100 laser-cut and mounted playing pieces: 40 &quot;long&quot; pieces representing major warships and 60 square ones representing smaller craft and airplanes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Exodus: Edge of Extinction is the first expansion of Exodus: Proxima Centauri (revised edition). The printing of this expansion, along with a reprint of the base game itself, was successfully funded via Kickstarter.<br/><br/>The original Exodus: Proxima Centauri was a distinguishable entry among other 4X games of the new wave, leaving its unique mark on the gaming world. With a game play focused on high-octane conflict fueled by raging war and cutthroat politics, it also introduced players to a rich science fiction setting, with its own back story and its own secrets. Exodus: Edge of Extinction expands both the gaming and the narrative aspect of Exodus: Proxima Centauri into an even more epic space strategy empire building game.<br/><br/>Exodus: Edge of Extinction represents the next chapter of an immersive story in which the remnants of humanity go to war against each other over a system they believe to be Proxima Centauri. Each player leads one of six unique factions with their own histories, strengths, unique special abilities and a set of new, exclusive technologies.<br/><br/>Exodus: Edge of Extinction also brings larger fleets, custom action cards and completely new mechanisms like the Combat Cards, adding a whole new layer to the spectrum of strategies already available in the base game.<br/><br/>The Kickstarter edition of Exodus: Edge of Extinction differs from the retail edition in that it contains the Exodus: Edge of Extinction – Kickstarter Limited Components, which further enhances the content introduced in this expansion by adding more faction specific Action Cards, additional Combat Cards and Political Cards, along with more scenarios for solo play.<br/><br/>Some Kickstarter backers received the Kickstarter Limited Components inside the expansion box, whereas others received the extras packaged separately. In all cases, however, the box itself for the Kickstarter edition is identical to the retail edition. The only way to tell if it is a Kickstarter edition or not is by examining the contents. In addition, these extras are available separately. None are Kickstarter-exclusive.<br/><br/>",

Each round you deal out a new resource grid, then players take turns placing their drones on the grid to collect the corresponding resources and then use them to level up their Replicants in order to gain victory points, abilities and of course, more Replicants. It is a relatively fast paced game that is half turn based and half simultaneous play that accommodates 2-6 player and takes 45minutes to an hour to play.<br/><br/>",
