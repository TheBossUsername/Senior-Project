        "description": "Lines of Battle: Quatre Bras 1815 covers one of the last battles of the Napoleonic wars.<br/><br/>In 1815, Napoleon ordered Marshall Ney to capture the critical crossroads of Quatre Bras in order to keep the Allied army away from linking up with the Prussian army. Fortunately for the Allies, the Dutch had disobeyed orders and posted a strengthened division at the crossroads. Wellington, the Allied commander, swiftly reacted and reinforcements were force-marched to aid the beleaguered Dutch. Ney also ordered reinforcements, but in his case the reinforcements were supposed to be helping Napoleon in his own battle with the Prussians at Ligny. In the end, Wellington's forces drove the French from the field, while Ney never got his reinforcements, which marched back and forth between Quatre Bras and Ligny affecting neither battle.<br/><br/>In this 2 player wargame, can you do better?<br/><br/>Each side controls around 10-20 units - these are infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The cavalry are further subdivided into 3 types: Heavy, Light, and Lancers. Each unit has a rating ranging from 2 to 4. When this is reduced below zero through combat hits, the unit is eliminated.<br/><br/>The scale is around 2000 men or 1000 cavalry per unit. Each game turn is half an hour. The map shows the environs of Quatre Bras, divided into areas. Between Areas are Approaches where infantry may deploy.<br/><br/>Each turn, a player receives a certain number of actions. These are spent manoeuvring the forces, including into combat, and rallying those with hits. Then both sides fire artillery, then the 2nd player does the same, and the turn is over. Quatre Bras has 14 turns in it, and victory is determined by casualties inflicted, and objectives held at the end.<br/><br/>There are optional rules and possible alternatives, such as the arrival of different French reinforcements.<br/><br/>",

Earth Encounters brings the Einstein in all of us to life. It&rsquo;s not only fun to play, but it sparks dialog among friends, brings value to our community, and perhaps can even change our world for the better! Earth Encounters is anti-trivia.<br/><br/>The game starts with the Timeship Encounter. An alien creature escaped the timeship and is hiding somewhere in the Eastern Time Zone. Encounter launches an elite team to recapture the alien creature. Players travel across the U.S. and the seven continents, competing to be the first to locate and capture the powerful yet invisible alien before it awakens and consumes all the knowledge possessed by Earth&rsquo;s inhabitants. Throughout this adventure, each player learns about the states and continents as they collect as many states and continent deeds as possible &ndash; they&rsquo;ll be needed when you come face-to-face with the alien creature.<br/><br/>Each player can only advance by correctly answering a question from the Q&amp;A Deck or successfully completing a thought experiment from the Challenge Deck.   In doing so, if they are the first to land on that particular state or continent, they are awarded a State Deed of Trust.  That means the state or continent is now under the players protection from the alien. The player who protects the state where the alien is hiding is considered the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Relative Paradox could best be described as a Deck Building Game, with mechanics including Strategy, Hand Management, and a little bit of Luck. The point is to match up History A with People B and multiplier/bonus for History C with Cosmos and Paradox Cards create &quot;trouble&quot; that alter history all together. All the cards are easily recognizable to their time in history, so you don't need to be a Historian to play. This game features all Public Domain Time Travelers including Professor Helvetius and Doctor Omega.<br/><br/>2 to 8 Players will have to take their Traveler into Time and Space to collect pieces of history and put them back together. First players will be dealt one time traveler to represent them during the game, these are Traveler Cards, The Traveler you are dealt is who you will represent throughout the game. Then each player is Dealt Five Cards from the main deck, the remainder are separated into one pile per the amount of players (i.e. 2 somewhat even piles for two players) and a card is placed face up on all sides (see the image above), these cards are now obtainable.<br/><br/>Each turn you can either create a timeline (matching cards with same symbols) or draw a card from the tabletop that is obtainable. A player can have as many or as few cards as needed in their hand at one time. When you make a pair, you do not draw to replenish. Also, if you have a timeline available to lay--you must use it and lay your pair/three of a kind. Each Timeline Card will have a value that will count towards your final tally, these are called Timeline Points. Each Traveler interacts with a particular timeline differently, either giving them a bonus/multiplier for Timeline Points or immunity from a certain Paradox.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Both sides saw the other as &quot;invaders,&quot; so the fight quickly escalated to one of extreme violence. The fight seesawed up and down the main street of Lone Jack, and when the rebels fired the Cave Hotel, a Yankee stronghold, their advantage appeared decisive. Foster now wheeled his only two artillery pieces forward, blasting the gray attack with double-shotted canister. <br/><br/>The Confederates owned the field as well as the dead. They quickly gathered the remains of the fallen, already spoiling under the torrid sun. Friend and foe alike they buried beneath the arching shade of the lone jack oak.<br/><br/>About the Rebel Yell! system<br/><br/>Rebel Yell! is a simulation of American Civil War small-unit tactics. The playing pieces in the game represent companies of infantry and cavalry or sections of artillery Each infantry and cavalry unit has one strength point and is equivalent to between 45 and 100 men, depending upon the scenario. Each artillery unit has two strength points and equals two guns. The players of Rebel Yell assume the roles of divisional commanders.<br/><br/>Each game turn is broken down into segments. During an action segment, the units of a particular player may conduct a single action. In the beginning modules these actions are: Move, Fire, Assault, and Rally. During any Small Arms segment, the units of a particular player may only fire.<br/><br/>There are no movement phases, fire phases, etc., as there are in other Civil War games. This absence, in addition to the fact that player segments are structured reciprocally, produces a feel of simultaneity uncommon to other designs.<br/><br/>One of the most difficult problems faced by the Civil War tactician was the &quot;problem of approach,&quot; in other words, how he should maneuver his unit to some objective while keeping his casualties and disorganization at a minimum. A commander who did not pay heed to the destructiveness of &quot;modern&quot; weaponry would find his formation damaged up to three hundred yards from the enemy. Rebel Yell addresses this problem. Within restrictions, defending units may fire at the enemy as he advances. Like a real-life commander, a player can no longer be certain that when he initiates an advance, his units will reach their objective. Players may find that even one or two companies Standing to Fire will be difficult to dislodge by frontal assault.<br/><br/>Although Rebel Yell is a complex design, it is not out of the reach of the novice gamer. The rules are programmed, allowing small portions to be digested first and getting players into the game quickly. Provisions are made for such factors as infantry line formations (Standing to Maneuver, Standing to Fire, Skirmishers, and Cover), volley effects, leader quality, morale, and regimental flags. The rules for cavalry and artillery are also extensive.<br/><br/>Although an excellent multi-player game, Rebel Yell accommodates the solitaire player, Likewise it can be played in a physically limited area. Rebel Yell is big only in the sense that it is detailed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Form on Admiral's Wake is a quick-playing miniatures game of fleet naval battle during the age of sailing warships.  It allows for the play of larger naval battles with a small number of players who will each control one or more squadrons of ships.  The game is typically played with miniatures on a hex grid.<br/><br/>The game system uses an action deck to determine which ships can activate and what actions they can perform.  The action cards have limitations based on a ship's fleet, sail state, wind orientation, crew quality, and damage level.  The more favorable the condition and status of a ship, the more cards it will activate on.<br/><br/>One card is flipped each turn and ships that meet the requirements of the card may perform actions as indicated in the instructions.  The actions allowed vary by card, but include moving one hex, sideslipping one hex, turning in a hex, and reloading cannons.  Once fired, cannons require two actions to reload.<br/><br/>After all actions from the flip of a card are completed, all ships with loaded cannons may fire simultaneously.  As a ship takes damage, its status reduces from undamaged to disabled to crippled.  As the status changes, the ship will have less chances to activate.<br/><br/>Additional rules cover critical hits, grappling, fires, forts, anchoring, and fire ships.<br/><br/>",

All over the land, people are vying to find a patron, one of the rich noble families who will support and encourage a creative soul with their wealth, fame, and good name.<br/><br/>One of the members of these illustrious nobility is looking for a fresh, young mind to carry into the halls of history.  To find the best and brightest, the Patron has organized a challenge.  All geniuses should seek to emulate the greatest man of their time, Leonardo da Vinci, and therefore, the most worthy artist will be the one who can turn Leonardo&rsquo;s dreams into reality.<br/><br/>As one of the Patron&rsquo;s hopeful aspirants, you have been invited to one of daVinci&rsquo;s private laboratories, to compete against other artists in their goal to follow in the late Master&rsquo;s footsteps.  Your job is to maneuver around the puzzle that is daVinci&rsquo;s lab, traversing the rotating gears of his workshop, all the while assembling a team of expert engineers to study and be the first to build a replica of one of da Vinci&rsquo;s designs.  The first recruit to successfully assemble and test the proposed machine will win the coveted spot in the Patron&rsquo;s household.  Do you have what it takes to win?<br/><br/>The object of the game is to move around a moving gear board, with each gear offering up a different resource for your build - plans, engineers, tools, and materials.  The plans tell the players what other resources they need to collect.  Plans are played with cards, engineers and tools are played on tokens (so they can be left on a board location), and materials are played with shards.<br/><br/>Once a player has all of the resources necessary to complete his build, they can move on to the final gear to assemble their creations, and then return to the beginning of the room.<br/><br/>",

Their task is to send the message to the gods of Asgard to ask them for help in the war with evil forces. They can do it by either building the ships and sailing to Asgard, or by killing one of evil monsters (Trwyth), after which, they will be allowed to go through the stone forest and reach Asgard. Evil side, of course, tries to prevent it from happening, but with slick tactics, vikings are able to achieve it. And this is when the real fun begins. With the help of almost 20 gods, the good side begins an even battle.<br/><br/>The evil gods and monsters try to chase and eliminate the good gods and vikings, to prevent them from reaching Yggdrasill. the tree on which Jormungard the snake lives. If the good manage to kill it,they win. If the evil, eliminate all good ones, they win.<br/> Every character in the game has 2 traits: strength and magic power + some of them, are able to use spells. Duels are, unfortunately simple, you choose either strength or magic, roll a die and add the result to the chosen trait. The higher result denotes the winner. After the 1st wounded the character's token is flipped and remains wounded until healed (successful die roll)or attacked and wounded again, which is the end for a given character.<br/><br/>The game is played on a huge board, divided into lands. There are seas, rivers, mountains, forests and places to explore, where magic items can be found. Characters can also learn spells in magic schools.<br/><br/>There are also event cards, drawn at the beginning of a new round.<br/>The game, though simple, and rather visually not too attractive, is a lot of fun to play. Because of the size of the board and numerous charters, it is never played the same way. The good may have many possible routes to get to Yggdrasill, and the abilities (spells) of some of their mightiest gods, can change a hopeless situation.<br/>If one changed the rules of battling, made a new colorful board and substitute cardboard tokens with plastic figures, the game would be a hit.<br/><br/>",

It is a vital balance point between the Lyrans and Hydrans. In Wall Cloud, find out what would have happened had the LDR reunited with the Lyrans.<br/><br/>The Vudar Enclave has far different than the Klingons tricked the Federation into believing, but it was still a player in the final years of the General War. They locked up territory in a &quot;neutral&quot; enclave that was secretly much closer to the Klingon Empire than thought. Find out about &quot;The Hole,&quot; containing a secret shipyard and fleet. In Static Fog, the Klingons decide to crush the Vudar. In Electric Storm, the LDR and Vudar decide to carve new empires from old.<br/><br/>The Seltorian Tribunal arrived late in the General War and asked the Klingons for a planet where they could set up a base to attack the Tholians. The Klingons were only too happy to have a new ally &ndash; until they discovered the Seltorian secret. In Vortex of Vengeance the Seltorians declare war on the Tholians. In Freak Storm Seltorians, Hydrans, LDR, and Vudar attack the Klingons.<br/><br/>Includes three copies of Countersheet Five, one copy of Countersheet Six, three Depot Charts (one for each of the new empires), and three Fleet Charts (one for each of the new empires).<br/><br/>",

There are also 12 Attribute cards, used in two of the games, 36 cardboard connectors, used in one game, and 12 gold medals, for scoring. The four games each take about 10 minutes, and use different skills.<br/>The first event, formations, has players racing to put their dragons in piles or in order, depending on the attribute shown on the randomly produced Attribute card. <br/>Matches is the second event. Players look for things in common between two randomly chosen dragon cards, and use that to take an attribute card from the pool or another player, in order to get the required number of attribute cards.<br/>The third event, Connections, incorporates connectors with the Dragon cards for a strategic domino type game, which uses comparisons to link or lock out other dragons.<br/>The final event, Battle, is the simplest, as players take turns to decide which attribute wins a battle between randomly selected cards.<br/>Cards are placed on the table, so there is no need to hold a hand of cards.<br/>The events are easy to play and help practice mathematics skills.<br/><br/>",

This game-within-the-game system can also be used to re-fight some of the great battles of the Thirty Years War. The 12 scenarios included in this pack are not in-depth simulations of those epic contests; they are instead a collection of quick mini-games that are meant to allow players a glimpse into the way battles of that era were fought. As in any war, not every battle is an even contest; some are puzzles where players take turns commanding each army to see which of them can do better as the disadvantaged side--or through luck and skill turn an historic defeat into a surprising victory.<br/><br/>The 12 battles in this pack are presented in chronological order, and if fought in that order will give players a brief running history of the war. Contestants may choose to play the games in any order, may select favorite battles to re-fight or may make a campaign by taking each battle in turn, with one player always taking the Imperial side in each contest and then tallying the results of each battle to reach a final score of wins and losses.<br/><br/>Players resolve the battles in this booklet utilizing the Optional Tactical Combat systems as found in the Holy Roman Empire game. Additional options for &quot;Create Your Own&quot; Battle scenarios are also included in those rules.<br/><br/>",

It can be played in various size boards: 8x8, 10x8 or 12x8.<br/><br/>The objective is to immobilize the opponent's Dux, to stalemate him, or to annihilate his army.<br/><br/>Classical captures (custodial and corner) apply to Latrunculi XXI in addition to the following capturing tactics:<br/><br/>     Push and Crush Attack<br/>     Flank Attack<br/>     Phalanx Attack<br/><br/><br/>Latrunculi XXI has rules that limit the Duxes' mobility when they are in combat, as well as locked soldiers (similar to blocked pawns in Chess) which strategically limit the pieces mobility to increase capture opportunities, and to minimize the chances of draws.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/latrunculi-petteia-xxi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.chessvariants.com/invention/latrunculi-petteia-xx...</a><br/><br/>",

Who can buy and sell his products and goods on the domestic market profitably or take in the most on the trading ships? Who can send the right delegate to parliament in order to influence the government legislative process, or erect distilleries, hotels and banks at the right moment to the benefit of his village?<br/><br/>Whoever has accumulated the most victory points in Cuba by the end of the game wins. Players earn victory points by shipping merchandise from the harbor, but also by erecting and using buildings, and by abiding by the law.<br/><br/>El Presidente:<br/><br/>The expansion to be used by 'Cuba'. An additional game board, more and different ship cards, laws, buildings, new character cards to be used with the other characters, and a whole new phenomenon: Cuba - the Arrival of the President!<br/>In their turn, players may take and play a character from the 'El Presidente' board: the worker, dancer, attorney, warden, revolutionary or musician. They all have different effects.<br/>The worker puts your goods into the warehouse; all your goods are safe this turn. The revolutionary gives you one victory point, the musician two money. The player with the dancer card becomes immediately the new start player; the old rule for determining the new start player is no longer in effect.<br/><br/>With the attorney a player may use a building even when his supervisor is not on the row or column of this building, paying one money. The warden may change two adjacent ships in position. There are two mule cards being used when playing with less than five players; these cards cannot be chosen. When all players have chosen a card, the car of the president moves to the position of the remaining card; remember, there are six cards that each turn are shuffled and randomly placed.<br/><br/>Under each card on the board are symbols that come into effect when the car of the president stops there. The first makes all law proposals go into effect; the second makes it possible to move the supervisor anywhere on a player board in the next round. The next symbol also is in effect for the next round: it allows you to pay one money and overbuild a building with another; the difference in resources must be paid as well. One symbol makes the leading player to go back two points on the score track; another allows players to purchase market wares at discount prices. Players must now not only consider which role they would like to take, but also which position they likely want to be visited by the president.<br/><br/>There are 2 additional laws in each of the four categories, so that the game can now last up to 8 rounds instead of just 6.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fast paced boardless board game &ndash; PeltaPeeps is a game for 2 to 6 players. The play combines negotiation and placement. Players take turns placing new game pieces and making connections in the play area. They may also flip or move another player's piece in each turn. Flipping a piece down lowers its scoring. However, a piece that has been flipped face down, may also be flipped up with some help from other Peeps, restoring its value. A piece may also be moved from one area to another. A player may never move their own pieces, and a piece may only be moved if it will not cause a discontinuity in the connected pieces already in play. The player with the most points counted up at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Each player has either 8 or 16 unique pieces per team color, with up to 6 colors, depending on game version. The versions are- PeltaPeeps For Two (2 player) or PeltaPeeps Core and Full games, both of which are 4 to 6 player.<br/><br/>Play revolves around the unique connections each piece can make- blocking pieces preventing other players from making favorable connections, leaving open connections that allow you to connect to your own color (giving you bonus points) or creating hubs for future plays. Different playing pieces have varying point values based on being face up or down and who they are connect to as well as what they are. Play continues until no more valid placements are available.<br/><br/>The game combines bluff and negotiation, as players get bonus points for connecting to their own color, but cannot directly reverse the moves other players make against their pieces. Even if players choose not to discuss their moves, the moves, themselves act as a form of diplomacy, potentially forcing other players to react to 3rd parties as play progresses.<br/><br/>The pieces started out as wood, but are now coming to market as UV printed and laser cut Acrylic.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Escabel is a drawless connection game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square grid (board). The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA stack is a set of one or more pieces piled onto each other on the same point. The color of a stack is the color of its topmost piece, which denotes its owner. The height of a stack is the number of pieces in it.<br/><br/>A crosscut is a 2x2 area containing two diagonally adjacent black stacks and two diagonally adjacent white stacks.<br/><br/>Two like-colored stacks are considered connected in the following cases:<br/><br/><br/>     They are orthogonally or diagonally adjacent to each other and not part of the same crosscut.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     They are both part of the same crosscut and higher than the lower enemy stack in that crosscut.<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of these actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Place a piece of your color on an empty point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Move the topmost piece of a stack of your color onto an orthogonally adjacent enemy stack, provided that, before the move, the heights of both stacks are the same. Then, place a piece of your opponent's color onto the stack from which you just moved your piece.<br/><br/><br/>You win if, at the start of your turn, there is a chain of connected stacks of your color touching the two opposite board edges of your color. You lose if, at the start of your turn, your opponent has such a chain and you have no moves available.<br/><br/>To make the game fair, White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with Black instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesFor a variant, allow piece movement only between stacks that belong to the same crosscut, or start the game with the board fully covered with black and white pieces in a checkered pattern. On odd-sized boards, the two possible checkered setups may be used.<br/><br/>Escabel was inspired by Matteo Perlini's Consta.<br/><br/>",

The number obtained is the power of his axe for that turn only.

If the roll is less than the power of the axe the attack is successful and the player is eliminated.  If the roll is equal to or greater than the power of the axe the attack fails.<br/><br/>If he chooses to declare an alliance he may ally with any one other player.  The individual chosen has no choice in the matter.  Allied players may not attack each other.<br/><br/>If at any point a player rolls a one for power all players' past alliances are voided.  If a player is allied with all other players, that player's turn is limited to a power roll (to see if they roll a one).<br/><br/>The last player to execute a turn is considered the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ynavi is a game where you play for victory points, and there are several mechanics to attain them. the main way is by scoring 'drakkars', the viking ship. Each drakkar needs to be filled with cubes of specific color in order to be scored, each scored earns 4 victory points.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each turn, the first player rolls 5 dice of different color each with 2 sides of values 1 through 3, each of which correlates to a different color of cubes and pile of cards. Then, players rotate in choosing a die. For a selected die, the player can either take a number of cubes equal to the number on the die, or draw that many cards from the pile, but may only keep one and discard the rest.<br/><br/>The 5 piles are as follows: blue, green, red, black, and yellow. Blue cards are equipments that stay with you for the rest of the game. Green cards are 'chiefs' that need to be filled with cubes to use, and can do powerful things, and stay for the rest of the game. Filling chiefs with cubes earns a victory point, failing to do so loses a victory point. Red cards are one time spells that can do cool things. Black cards are negative statuses you assign to an opponent that they may only remove by filling it with cubes. Lastly, yellow are quests, that if satisfied in the scoring phase at the end earn victory points.<br/><br/>Once an option is chosen, a player may use a card if applicable, or place their cubes on their drakkars, chief, or black card inflicted on him/her. Then turn rotates until all players go and all dice are chosen (first player gets 2 turns each round), and then the first player token rotates and a new round begins. The game ends when either a pile of cards or cubes remains empty at the end of the round.<br/><br/>",

Players take on the roles of distinct characters, each with their own 'Job of the Future' and unique set of preferred future conditions. They compete to create a world where their future job is relevant and secure.<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Up to 5 players choose from 10 &quot;Jobs of the Future&quot; with differing back stories and victory conditions. They draw and play cards from a deck of 100 Impact Cards that relate current technological trends to future conditions. They assess and discuss the likely primary and secondary impacts of each card on one or more of 10 different &quot;domains&quot; (e.g. Manufacturing, Energy, Security, Home, Work) and place or remove influence cubes. <br/>There are also Disruption Cards that indicate large-scale or sudden shifts in the system that pose larger challenges to the players. <br/>After each round of play (every player has had one turn), players collect the played cards and generate the &quot;Headline of the Era&quot; from player suggestions.<br/>When a player sees that the number of influence cubes equals or exceeds the win condition on three of the domains specified for their &quot;Job from the Future&quot;, they reveal their role and win the game.<br/><br/>This game was originally designed by Idea Couture in collaboration with Policy Horizons Canada, an organization within the Public Service of Canada that examines emerging policy challenges and new ideas and questions posed by trends in technological and social development.<br/><br/>There is not a great deal of strategy or mechanical challenge in this game, but that's not the point; the purpose of the game is to get the players thinking and discussing the possible second-order effects of current developments, using their logic to persuade other players on what other domains could be affected besides the obvious ones. <br/>This game appears to be aimed at wannabe policy analysts, amateur futurologists and soi-disant speculative thinkers generally.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BrazChess is a Chess-like game that combines in its design several elements found in other games of its kind (like Modern Chatranj, Makruk, Shogi and FIDE Chess) along with brand new ideas to provide a unique experience to the players.<br/><br/>Pieces are weaker than in FIDE Chess, but stronger than in Modern Shatranj and Makruk - so the game fits as another bridge between these games and regular Chess. Even though the game has the same number of pieces that there is in Chess (32), there is a slightly greater variety of them in BrazChess (8 against 6 in Chess). Some of the &quot;parachuting&quot; that occurs in Shogi is present (regarding the movement of Grand Dukes - a promoted Pawn); you'll also find different forms of capturing (suicidal attacks and the Grand Duke's Zone of Control). Also present is the concept of passing your turn.<br/><br/>What you need to play it:<br/>In order to play BrazChess, you will need:<br/>A) The rules (see Files);<br/>B) A Modern Chess board (8x8) and Pieces (you'll need to either paint the heads or bases of two Pawns from each side, or use some other Pieces to represent the 2 Lords from each side). Note that the starting position of some pieces (like the Rooks) is different than in regular Chess;<br/>C) 6 different pieces, coins, tokens or even checkers pieces (for the promoted Pawns aka Grand Dukes);<br/>D) 1 tokens to represent Passing; <br/>E) An auxiliary board (the Duchy) or a designated space on the table.<br/><br/>The creation of this game was inspired by Chatranj, Modern Chatranj, Makruk, Shogi, Chess/Orthochess (FIDE Chess) and the book &quot;Encyclopedia of Chess Variants&quot; - by D. B. Pritchard. While it is true that there are several Chess-like games like this in the World, Chess is, itself, a variant of an older game, that was already a variant of an even older game. BrazChess, while definitely a member of the Chess family of games, has many unique features that will certainly deliver a different experience than the other games of its kind.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Early Years of the Jihad<br/><br/>November 3067 saw the culmination of work two centuries in the making, work begun by Primus Conrad Toyama of ComStar, successor to Jerome Blake and the man responsible for single-handedly turning ComStar into a pseudo-religious organization with a vision: to lead mankind to the light...by any means necessary.<br/>When the Star League self-destructs, a shadowy power behind the fanatical Word of Blake pulls the strings taut in righteous anger, launching a war to bring humanity to its knees. Confusion reigns, and each faction finds itself isolated amid its own turmoil. Yet as a new decade dawns, glimpses of the greater whole begin to appear through the dark clouds. The true battle has only just begun.<br/><br/>Blake Ascending: A Jihad Compilation is an omnibus reprint of Dawn of the Jihad and Jihad Hot Spots: 3070; the first two sourcebooks in the seminal Jihad plot line. The Blake Ascending sourcebook shakes the Classic BattleTech universe to its foundation, documenting the opening years from 3067 to 3070. The series of events presented in this book unfold in a rolling format, allowing readers to immerse themselves more directly into the action than ever before. Players of both Classic BattleTech and Classic BattleTech RPG will find framework rules to run any type of campaign in regions through out the Inner Sphere during this chaotic time.<br/><br/>Notes:<br/><br/>Blake Ascending is a reprint of Dawn of the Jihad and Jihad Hot Spots: 3070, in one volume. Except for errata, no changes have been made to the contents.<br/>Editors: whenever you cite Blake Ascending in an article, please also cite the relevant pages from the other two books. In Blake Ascending, the first 160 pages match those of Dawn of the Jihad exactly (ex: BA p. 137 is the same as DotJ p. 137). All pages after p. 160 correspond with Jihad Hot Spots: 3070, when 160 is subtracted from the BA page number (ex: BA p. 200 is the same as JH:3070 p. 40). The reprinted JH:3070 table of contents is on pp. 162-163 in BA.<br/><br/>",

Today they have decided to settle the argument once and for all with an epic battle in the streets!<br/><br/>Cats vs Dogs is a two-player game. One player will control the cats and the other the dogs. Your goal is to take control of the yard friendly to your opponent &ndash; or scare them off the board. But be careful, the board is littered with distractions that will make your animals lose focus during the heat of battle. Can you lead your animals to victory?<br/><br/>Each player gets 10 pieces which are set up hidden from the opponent. Players move on a grid showing several houses and a street from the neighborhood. When two pieces occupy the same square, both players will reveal their piece and play a card adding to its value. The player with the highest total will win the battle. However, if you're fighting in a square with a distraction, you total battle strength will be reduced.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who can occupy his opponent's yard on the far side of the board. This is a lighthearted game that plays quickly and is simple enough for young children but with enough strategy to keep their parents entertained as well.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Cats vs Dogs by Chris Hansen is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License.<br/><br/>",

Only one game team will reign supreme!<br/><br/>To Win: Place all your active Guru markers (any remaining on the board) on any of the gray marked spaces in your opponent&rsquo;s home row or remove all of your opponent&rsquo;s markers.<br/><br/>Setup: Place the board between players and orient it so that one player is facing the 3 Games Unlimited Gurus and the other player their mirror duplicate Gurus from Unlimited Games. The row closest to the player is their home row. Each player receives <br/>3 Guru markers in a matching color. Place these markers, <br/>1 each, on the 3 gray spaces on your home row. Shuffle the <br/>4 Action cards and, without looking at them, flip half the cards over to their opposite side. Deal 1 card face up in front of each player and place 1 card to the side of the board. The 4th card is removed from the game. The first player will be the one who has most recently looked in a mirror.<br/><br/>Play: Each player has an Action card that displays a possible move for any of their markers. There is a 3rd card to one side of the board that cannot be used by either player during their turn. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they move 1 of their active Guru markers (Note: Active Guru markers are the ones remaining on the board) according to the Action card; they then replace the card they used with the 3rd card. The other player then moves accordingly, and exchanges their card with this new 3rd card - the card the first player just used.<br/>Moving a marker on top of one of an opponent player&rsquo;s markers removes that opponent&rsquo;s marker from the game.<br/><br/>A player may stack a maximum of 2 of their pieces on any space except the center space. A stack prevents either stacked piece from being captured.<br/><br/>Moving your active Guru markers to the home row spaces of <br/>your opponent wins you the game.<br/><br/>As long as one of a player&rsquo;s markers remains on the center space on the board, that player may, during their turn, flip their Action card over to its opposite face to introduce a new move into the game.<br/><br/>Action cards should be oriented with the name of the action at the bottom of the card. Each card shows the player&rsquo;s marker in the middle of the card and indicates which spaces, either forward, backward or to the side, to which they may move their marker. Below this diagram, the action on the other face of the card is displayed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They will fight and avoid monsters that appear on the map, look for treasure sites and the treasures therein, meet with natives to buy and sell, hire muscle, and take on quests.  They gain Victory Points by discovering treasure sites, treasure, killing monsters, fulfilling quests, and learning new spells.<br/><br/>The game lasts thirty days.  Characters can perform a certain number of actions each day based on their current health.  The actions include: Move, Sneak, Search, Parlay, Rest, Magic, and Combat.  Every two days, an Occurrence chart is used to randomly determine which monsters and natives appear on the map and which ones leave.  At the end of the thirty days, characters add up the Victory Points they scored and a winner is determined.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This can be done only a limited number of times.<br/><br/>The player may alter the results with special abilities, if these are charged up. After that, the dice are assigned to their respective detectors (depending on die color and number).<br/><br/>Dice of opposite color in the same detector annihilate.

Its story is heating up, and the most climactic event is about to begin: The Tournament Battles!<br/><br/>In this game, players are readers of the manga &quot;BOOKMAKERS&quot;. The player who has been most excited at the manga wins the game. The game is published in the same format as 'Weekly Shonen Jump', a very popular weekly manga in Japan. The designer is publishing under his own label Åtsuka seisaku (ãªãªãã«è£½ä½) outside of his other work with KUA. The doujin publisher Gyunbuku-ya (ãããã¶ãå±) is listed for design work on the game, not strictly as the game publisher.<br/><br/>There are nine competitors in the tournament. At the beginning of the game, each player is randomly assigned a competitor as their favorite character. Players take turns placing a competitor to form a tournament bracket. Then players secretly choose who will be the champion of the tournament.<br/><br/>There are eight battles in the tournament. Most of a battle proceeds automatically, and rough probability of victory is calculated easily. But before the battle begins, players have some chances to place a fan letter face-down on a competitor to modify the result toward their favor.<br/><br/>Here are how you get excited (score victory points).<br/>1) You score points when your favorite character wins a battle, and ultimately, you score big points when your favorite character wins the tournament. <br/>2) Each competitor has a destined rival. You score points when your favorite character fights with their destined rival. Win or lose doesn't matter. <br/>3) For each battle, you score points if you have correctly predicted who will win the battle. <br/>4) You score points if you have correctly predicted the champion of the tournament.<br/><br/>The player with the highest total wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Field of Mars was originally intended to function as a 'battle board' for the Lace Wars series, which is 'operational' in scope and normally resolves battles using a combat results table. To add value to the product, Field of Mars has been designed to function as a complete game in its own right, suitable for playing both random and historical battles devised by the players. No knowledge of the Lace Wars rules is required. (Caveat: the game does not include any historical scenarios.) With some modification it could also be used to play battles generated by different game systems.<br/><br/>The game uses a gridded mat and terrain tiles to create a wide variety of battlefields. The players' forces are deployed on this mat in stacks of counters called 'wings'; the wings are the 'manoeuvre unit' in this system. The players issue orders to their wings by rolling dice and distributing them among their wings. The more pips a die has showing, the greater the number of tactical choices its wing has. Once orders have been issued, a series of discrete steps is followed, each permitting the execution of one particular kind of action (for example: Advance, Fire, Assault). In each step the players decide whether any eligible wings (those with the correct die value) will execute that action. The object of the game is to render opposing wings hors de combat. In the context of the game this means the wing is removed from play. This is accomplished through artillery and musket fire, cavalry charges, and infantry assaults. The first side to go over the required number of hors de combat wings loses the battle.<br/><br/>The rules include instructions for creating random battles using the counters provided and also instructions on how to use the game to fight battles generated within the Lace Wars system.<br/><br/>Components<br/>1) One large play mat, called the Battlefield.<br/>2) 360 die cut counters representing various generic forces, plus markers. Scale is variable.<br/>3) 60 terrain tiles<br/>4) Rules, charts, and tables.<br/><br/>",

With this Campaign Chapter, your heroes will find some good old orc pleasure: crossing the dark corridors of evil dungeons and crypts, haunted by revenants hungry for fresh meat and looking for new souls to join their ranks. There might even be some evil necromancer that possesses the key to a well kept treasure! It all depends whether you are there to smash some skulls or to bring back some treasures.<br/><br/>Revenants are not guided by the same principles as the living. There is no Alert level, nor Patrols. However, if an undead notices a possible prey he will attract others like him, and if you let the undead ranks grow, you will end up overwhelmed. During the Patrol phase, each tomb over the tiles where heroes are can generate undead.

        "description": "You are a Drop Racer. Your goal is to be the best racer in the land and get the Great Drop Trophy. But this isn't any normal race. Instead of who can go the fastest or farthest, you are trying to be the first one to earn enough points. To earn points, you must collect special Drops that litter the race track while avoiding the Black Drops. Collect the right Drops, score points, win the trophy. Welcome to Drop Racers.<br/><br/>Drop Racers is a fast, family-friendly game about flicking and nudging small cars around the table and trying to bump into different colored drops. Each player is trying to use the drops they've bumped into to score cards in their hand. The first player to score 15 points worth of cards wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/>______________<br/><br/>This game was one of the 4 finalists in the 2016 Mayday Games Design Contest held at Geekway to the West (game convention).

        "description": "&quot;Blood for Blood&quot; is a brand new expansion that will enrich the OrcQuest universe with new enemies. With the Secondary Campaign included, your heroes can compete against the Barbarians, this famous warrior folk that can easily compete with the Orcs. Along with Humans, Elves and Dwarves, the Barbarians are one of the major nations to have always been at war with the Orcs... or is it the other way around? Nevertheless, it remains a major problem: a rumor of alliance with the Kingdom of Istarra in the conquest of the Bloody Woods begins to cause trouble among greenskins. Our heroes have thus decided to go to settle their account as they know how best to do it: with brutality.<br/><br/>At first, the heroes will have to return home and repel the Barbarian troops, thrown in the vicinity of the Bloody Woods. Barbarian camps are set up everywhere and our heroes will have to attack and destroy them as quickly as possible, before their enemies gather. The Alert track will be used to generate waves of increasingly powerful enemies.<br/><br/>Through a series of unfortunate events, the heroes find themselves facing Ragnar, the Barbarian King, and will have to entertain him in a battle arena. If they emerge champions in the events, they can challenge the warring regent and compete against him. Be careful, because his strength is legendary. Moreover, as he plays at home, his subjects will not stand by idly. In this situation, the Alert track will serve to measure the enthusiasm of the Barbarian King. The more combos the heroes make, the higher the cursor on the track goes. When the cursor has passed the last level, Ragnar the Barbarian King will finally be eager to descend into the arena.<br/><br/>",

Fight by Caesar&rsquo;s side as he wages war for mastery of the Roman World upon battlefields soaked in Roman blood.<br/>Regretfully we cannot tarry, as did Caesar, in the arms of Egypt&rsquo;s beautiful Queen Cleopatra, but we can join him for the concluding battles of the Civil War in Africa, where we shall at last confront Caesar&rsquo;s relentless opponents together with the armies of that inveterate enemy of Rome, King Juba of Numidia.<br/>With this supplement for Hail Caesar we invite you to come, see and conquer for yourself in a series of new scenarios representing key battles in the career of Julius Caesar. We take a detailed look at the armies of Rome and her enemies, and we consider the lives of some of the greatest Roman commanders of them all, together with suitable rules to represent them on the tabletop.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This game is a precursor to The Dragon that Engulfed the Sun (Modern War #42). It simulates the war that would have occurred on the Korean peninsula just prior to that game&rsquo;s setting. The Dragon that Engulfed the Sun assumes that a Chinese victory had already occurred in Korea. This game, however, simulates the entirety of that preceding conflict, beginning with a supposed North Korean invasion of South Korea.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map on one sheet &amp; 176 counters.<br/><br/>(perhaps it would be useful to spend fewer words on The Dragon that Engulfed the Sun and instead tell us more about this game?  Like who is fighting who?)<br/>(seconded. Also,disambiguate &quot;It&quot; and &quot;that game&quot;. It sounds like Dragon and Hermit Kingdom is a NK invasion of SK that somehow ends in a Chinese victory that then leads to whatever happens in Dragon Engulfed the Sun (Japan?).<br/><br/>",

Players can enjoy this simple-to-learn, two-player, battle game between armies to defeat your opponent's Leader and win the battle. The game of chance, simplified strategy, and fantasy warfare!<br/><br/>Zaldar's return from the dead, with a dragon army behind him, has shaken the world and now armies and factions of all kinds rally for war! The world needs a new Alliance, but who will form this new Alliance? Will Zaldar reign supreme? Or will it be...you?<br/><br/>Objective of Game: Battle between armies to defeat your opponent's Leader and win the battle.<br/><br/>Components of Game: 35 Cards per deck, 6 sided die, Health Point Tokens, Game Board, Scroll of Rules, &amp; stickers<br/><br/>How To Play: <br/>Leader Appears - place your Leader closest to you. The Leader will not be able to battle until the army in front of the Leader is defeated. <br/>Shuffle - shuffle your deck and place your deck face down to your right.<br/>Army Line Up - draw the top 5 cards from your deck and place them face up in front of your Leader. This is your army, ready for battle.<br/>Roll Order - both players roll the die. Whoever rolls the highest number goes first. Each turn consists of a Placement Phase and a Battle Phase. <br/>Placement Phase - if you have an army space open place the next top card from your deck in its place.<br/>Battle Phase - you may attack twice per turn, but not with the same character. First declare who you're attacking by whom you're attacking with. Roll the die. If the number matches your character's Roll Number, you deal the character's corresponding Attack Number to your opponent's character's Health Points. If not, the attack misses and no damage is dealt. If damage is dealt more than your opponent's character's Health Points, then the character is slain and placed in the Slain Pile. If damage is dealt less than your opponent's character's Health Points, then Health Points are replaced with the correctly numbered Health Point Token. <br/>Leader's Entrance  - Your Leader comes into play when your army is depleted and no Units or Generals stand in front of him. The Leader can now attack, dealing the most damage on the battlefield, but can also be attacked by your opponent. <br/>Victory  -  Once your Leader's Health Points reach 0 you lose the battle. If your opponent's Leader's Health Points reach 0 you win the battle<br/><br/>Classes: <br/>Unit - bulk of army, 30 per deck, average attack and health points, &amp; adorned with copper frame and tablet<br/>General - more powerful characters on the battlefield, 4 per deck, stronger attack and health points, &amp; adorned with silver frame and tablet<br/>Leader - Leader of your army/Alliance, 1 per deck, strongest attack and health points &amp; adorned with golden frame and tablet<br/><br/>Battling: Roll Numbers &amp; Attack Numbers<br/>When battling roll the die. If your roll matches your character's Roll Number then you deal the corresponding Attack Number (below the Roll Number). If the Attack Number is higher than your opponent's character's Health Points, then it's Slain and sent to the Slain Pile. If the Attack Number is lower than your opponent's character's Health Points, than replace their Health Points with the correctly numbered Health Point Token.<br/><br/>Character Types: <br/>Warrior<br/>Beast <br/>Mage <br/>Beast Warrior<br/>Beast Mage<br/><br/>Health Point Tokens:<br/>The numbered, circle tokens replace a character's Health Points after they take damage. If you character takes 3 damage, from your opponent, and your character's Health Points are 5 then you replace your character's Health Points with the Health Point Token numbered 2.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "FiveCore Brigade Commander: Brigade Level Warfare in the 20th Century. By Ivan Sorensen. While the rules are not written for any particular scale of miniatures, they will work very well with 3mm, 6mm and 10mm figures, where each stand can look like a unit in its own right. Playing in 15mm is certainly possible, but tank models will take up a disproportionate amount of table-space compared to infantry stands.<br/><br/>GROUND AND TIME SCALE:<br/>The game does not adhere to a strict time scale. A turn is the time it takes for a meaningful action to take place on the gaming table and for units to potentially incapacitate an enemy company sized formation. Depending on the actions taking place, this may be from a few minutes to half an hour or longer. If you are tracking time for the purposes of a scenario, assume an average of 10 minutes per turn or roll 3D6 each turn, to determine how many minutes it took. Think of your game as a movie. As the battle rages, the camera zooms in on a particular unit and focuses on it, while the rest of the world ceases to exist for a moment. Ground scale is roughly 1&rdquo; = 100 yards.<br/>Engagement distances have been kept very conservative, to account for the fact that our flat, featureless tables would be covered in hedge rows, hills, crevices and depressions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hoist the main anchor and batten down the hatches, as you and your opponents compete to rule the seven seas in Fleets of Fortune! Recruit your crew members through influence, put them to work to amass your wealth, and use your riches to acquire your fleet of ships to conquer the world. Rough tides await, and it will take an even rougher band of buccaneers to heft and hornswoggle their way to the top. Do you have what it takes, or are ye just another cowardly landlubber.<br/><br/>Utilizing light engine building and hand management along with a 'take that' mechanic, players will utilize specific influence cards or items to recruit crew members to their team. Once recruited, each crew member has a unique action to either build wealth or improve their crew. Once a player has the proper payment, they can pay the fee to add a ship to their armada. The first player to build a fleet of the four most powerful and fully-manned ships before their opponents is the winner. There is no second place, unless you count Davy Jones' locker...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

There's a catch, though - like in mahjong, you can't win with a discard that you've already discarded yourself.

Use the different actions on the cards to deploy troops and attack.<br/><br/>Setup is as simple as dealing 5 cards to each player, and dropping 5 cubes from each player onto the table from a suitable height to create a random starting battlefield.<br/><br/>Each turn a player may move a soldier, play up to two cards, and draw new cards from the deck. The different card actions are equally represented in the deck, and they are:<br/>Map pointer - Place one soldier in an exact spot on the table<br/>Three circles - Drop three soldiers onto the table<br/>Hammers - Close combat attack<br/>Arrow - Ranged attack<br/>Circle/grenade - Thrown to create an area-of-effect attack<br/>Footpath/mine - Played in your opponents turn as a response to movement or deployment<br/><br/>Play until the deck is empty, and count points for survivors on the board and number of soldiers killed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

This surprisingly realistic game enables players to experience life as any of 50 different animals, and each animal has a mate.<br/><br/>How do you strategize to eat, mate, stay alive, and pass your genes along to the next generation? Each animal has a special survival rating, plus unique abilities to help when hunting or defending against predators...<br/><br/>Are you a carnivore, herbivore or insectivore?<br/><br/>A fox has special abilities and strategic advantages, but so does the whitetail deer, robin, and squirrel. Which animal is better... the moose or the mouse? Select your starting Pack of animals carefully and the race is on to pass your genes along to the next generation.<br/><br/>Wildlife Web is both competitive and cooperative. On the one hand, the game features classic predator-prey relationships where mountain lions hunt rabbits, deer, elk, or bison with the roll of the dice.<br/><br/>On the other hand there is cooperation as robins warn the deer as a mountain lion approaches. Your deer gains 2 extra defense points for every robin on the table.<br/><br/>Fifty random Event Cards introduce everything from hailstorms to bird alarms that can help or hinder your quest for survival.<br/><br/>Just like in real life, a highway runs through the game, forming a deathtrap for some species and an opportunity to scavenge for others.<br/><br/>A Day/Night card alternates play between diurnal and nocturnal animals so your bat is safe during the day while your hawk can go hunting.<br/><br/>With thousands of potential interactions and many uncontrolled factors, the game is never the same... except that you will have fun every time!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Every manufacturing concern was now faced with the daunting tasks of converting production facilities to wartime goods at levels never before seen during peacetime. The focus on the US steel industry was of particular concern, as nearly all weapons and wartime support derived from their factories and workers. However, nearly all of the leaders and owners of the US steel industry were either very dismissive or even obstructionist of the prospects the US would become involved in the war, and President Roosevelt&rsquo;s attempts to ready the country for war.<br/><br/>Nearly all of the iron ore, as well as much of the limestone, needed for the steel industries were shipped over the Great Lakes from the iron ore fields in Minnesota to the ports at Chicago, Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland, Buffalo in the US and Hamilton, Ontario in Canada. From those ports the iron ore was shipped by rail to the steel mill complexes in Gary, Detroit, Cleveland, Youngstown, Pittsburgh, Buffalo and Hamilton. The massive ore carriers that plied the waters of the Great Lakes sailed from mid-April to late November when weather and water conditions permitted. However, it soon became apparent that the amount of iron ore laid up in late November 1941 for use during the winter and spring was totally inadequate for the war effort. The US &ldquo;arsenal of democracy&rdquo; would be essentially shooting blanks due to shortages of steel and idle plants if the shortfalls of iron ore and limestone were not quickly addressed. In a bold decision it was decided to mobilize at least part of the Great Lakes ore carrier fleet to allow it to begin loading and delivering the badly needed iron and limestone ores a month ahead of the regular start of the sailing season. Besides the severe challenges of the late winter weather, with severe storms, ice bergs and jams and frigid waters, finding officers, crew, and dock workers to work at the loading and unloading ports would be difficult as wartime drafts and the demands for materials and men from other wartime challenges were encountered. Historically, the &ldquo;Winter Fleet&rdquo; led to 1942 setting all-time new records in the delivery of ore via the Great Lakes, as well as production of steel. But the risks and costs were high.<br/><br/>Breaking the Ice is a solitaire play game on the Great Lakes &ldquo;Winter Fleet&rdquo;. The player will have to allocate valuable resources and deploy the car ferry ice breakers to support the ore fleet in the mission of delivering the most ore to the production ports as possible, with a minimal amount of damage to the fleet as possible. Can you do as well, or better, than your historical counterparts?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The menu items combine into various meals of 1 to 4 items each and are arranged in specific shapes.  Menu items are worth 0 to 4 points each, with those forming larger meals generally worth more points.  Completed meals are eaten by removing them from the hand and placimg them in the player's eaten deck.<br/><br/>Various special cards allow players to swoop in to grab food during another player's turn, return food in hand to the trays, take food out of another player's hand, and other effects.<br/><br/>The game ends when any one of the trays has been emptied of menu items.  Players then see if they have filled their stomachs, overeaten, or wasted food.  Eaten meals are arranged in a grid (size depends on number of players): if the grid is completely filled with no gaps or excess, they have successfully filled their stomachs and gain a bonus.  Eaten meals that don't fit in the stomach score a penalty; uneaten food still in hand scores a greater penalty.  Highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The game (for 2-8 players) has simple rules, is also suitable for children (ages 6 and up) and includes a strategy aimed not only at acquiring personal points but also at blocking the game of the opponents. The aim of the game is to discard all the cards first, that is, to remain without cards in hand.<br/>The cards can be discarded by putting each waste in the right dumpster but only if the right dumpster has been put on the table before. There are also some waste cards that can pollute and block a dumpster. In that case, only cards with a 4R (Recycle) process can unblock pollute dumpsters. Some special waste can seriously pollute the environment so that if played they will penalize the player by forcing him to draft three more cards from the deck; as an additional effect, all players should pass a card to the relative player on their left.<br/><br/>",

Together you will solve puzzles, engage in battles, gather loot and decide the path your story will take. As the game progresses, your character will earn Experience Points and level up, discover new locations, acquire and craft items, learn new skills and magic, master weaponry and become increasingly powerful through many different types of encounters in an ever changing world.<br/><br/>Adventure Ink is a write-and-role playing game. At times you will be drawing cards and rolling dice, and then writing the results of your draws and rolls on various game components, including the dry erase gameplay board. These results will assist you in role playing as your character within the illustrated settings you help create. Using an innovative character personality system and a deterministic tactical combat system, battle outcomes will be determined based on your strategies and decisions, not on dice rolls or randomly drawn modifiers. The game can be played as a single competitive/cooperative skirmish or as a cooperative campaign over a series of sessions where, as a group, you will use the accompanying Scenario book to choose which path to follow from a series of encounters. A Game Master, or &ldquo;GM&rdquo;, who reads the story and controls the various Non-Player Characters (&ldquo;NPCs&rdquo;) is not needed to play Adventure Ink.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionConnecticut is a drawless connection game for two players: Black and White. It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. The suggested board size is 19x19. The top and bottom edges of the board are colored black; the left and right edges are colored white.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, by putting a single stone down on the board, then turns alternate.<br/><br/>On subsequent turns, either player may either place a single stone down on the board or a 1x3 triomino.<br/><br/>The game is won by the player who completes a chain of orthogonally or diagonally adjacent stones of their color touching the two opposite board edges of their color. Draws are not possible.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means that White will have the option, on his first turn only, to change sides instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>",

Observed on 25 April each year, Anzac Day was originally devised to honour the members of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps (ANZAC) who served in the Gallipoli Campaign, their first engagement in the Great War (1914&ndash;1918).<br/><br/>In Anzac Day, players are deciding how to spend Anzac Day by drafting cards and playing them into their timeline. Cards depict traditional Anzac activities, that award points, and non- Anzac Day activities, that grant players special abilities.<br/><br/>This continues until one, or more players have played 12 cards into their timeline. Once this happens a final round will occur after which players will score points based on Anzac Day cards in their timeline, any objectives they have fulfilled and medals collected.

Europe has erupted in war, and it's up to you to salvage what is left for your people.<br/><br/>Dealers in Hope is a deck-building game of conflict. As faction leaders, players vie for control of a future Europe that is a shell of its former glory. Build a deck that matches your faction's play style and take back the continent!<br/><br/>Each player controls a different faction leader with unique abilities and a unique starting deck. The leader you choose determines how you score victory points to win the game. Regardless, all leaders score a bulk of their points through conquest. On your turn, select an action by placing one of your tokens on the action board. Actions fall into one of three categories: Train (add cards to your deck), Reorganize (manipulate your deck), and Assault (attack territories). Action slots are limited, so it is essential to plan ahead and guess your opponents' moves.<br/><br/>Dealers in Hope uses several types of cards, with some types, i.e., professional cards, being selected randomly and others coming from the game's preset deck suggestions. Each set of professional cards has three levels &mdash; level 1, level 2, and master &mdash; and you must Train these increasingly powerful cards in order. Battles are fought via back-and-forth card play. Cards contain attack, defense, support, and (often) effects. The attacker plays as many cards as desired from their hand, then the defender gets a single chance to play cards in defense. Finally, the attacker gets one more chance to beat the defender. The winner gains/holds the territory, along with bonuses associated with that territory.<br/><br/>Unlike many games of this type, Dealers in Hope focuses not only on the military side of warfare, but also on the people behind the scenes: the civilians, masses, etc. who affect and are affected by the campaign.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

They advance their Agendas by voting strategically and anticipating how other players will vote. The player whose Agenda prevails at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Every round has three phases: Draw (players gain Political Capital), Policy Rollout (players determine which policies will be up for vote), and Legislative Session (players lobby for their positions, make promises they may or may not keep, and then vote on Policies). All players vote (Yea, Nay, or Abstain) for all of the Policies in the Policy Rollout at the same time and simultaneously reveal all their votes after the Presiding Officer has called &quot;Time!&quot; The amount of Political Capital players use when voting will affect the outcome. Each Policy vote is resolved (Pass or No pass) in turn&mdash;with the Center of Gravity token (COG) moving on the game board as the Policy dictates.<br/><br/>The Political Animals game board is a grid with the four quandrants and a Moderate center representing player Agendas. The COG starts the game in one of the four center locations that make up the Moderate center. The COG's location is always public and players can see every move it makes as a result of Policies being passed. The COG location represents the current prevailing Agenda.<br/><br/>The final location of the COG on the game board identifies the winner of the game.<br/><br/>Short-game and long-game variants are included along with the major Hidden Agenda variant, as well as Special Ability cards and Amendments that may be added in to change up play.<br/><br/>&mdash;Description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is a pen and paper type of game, with no display offered or required.<br/><br/>The game is structured to last six turns, and the game offers three layers of complexity.  Each turn consists of an action phase, followed by a consolidation phase.  A deck of cards drives the sequencing of when drivers act.  On every turn, each driver has a D6 rolled to check if they have some sort of driving incident (improvements and detrimental problems).  If an incident is triggered, it is immediately resolved.  Otherwise, drivers who have a normal turn are resolved in the consolidation phase.<br/><br/>After six turns the race is completed, and the winning driver is noted.  Motorsport allows players to easily rerun entire series of races from Formula 1, Indy, Nascar and other racing series.  Real-world results (qualifying and final standings) inform the statistics that drive the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dilemma or Dubito is played with two or three decks of standard playing cards. Each player is dealt a hand of eight and the remainder form a draw pile.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player plays one card to their layout and then draws a replacement. A player's layout consists of four lines of cards:<br/><br/><br/>    1. Cards that increase in value<br/>    2. Cards in the same suit<br/>    3. Cards in the same suit that increase in value<br/>    4. Cards of the same rank<br/><br/><br/>These lines are fixed at the start of the game (i.e. a player cannot play to a line and decide later which one it is.)<br/><br/>The game ends when no one can play any longer. Players score one point for each card in line 1, two for each in line 2, etc.<br/><br/>The book versions of the game (German and second English) suggest playing with two decks even with more players and also give some variants:<br/><br/><br/>     In Subito a player may play multiple cards on their turn, replenishing only after all cards are played. (With two players use just one deck.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>     In Judico players do not have hands; instead on a turn a player draws a card and then may play it or discard it. Discarded cards are out of the game. The rules for the lines are relaxed in this version.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's the 1920s, and before these new airlines people are talking about can start flying around the world, the routes the aeroplanes will fly have to be mapped out and tested. As a daring pilot, you want to be the first, you want to set the record for the fastest flight between two cities, to be known as the Route-Finder &mdash; and the most challenging flights are intercontinentals: London to Melbourne, London to Wellington, or Tokyo to Rome.<br/><br/>But, if you're going to win fame and (perhaps) fortune, you need to be a careful planner and a dedicated engineer. Your aeroplane will have limited performance, so your route must be carefully chosen, and your aeroplane design well thought out to complete the route as quickly as possible. Before getting stuck into the fun stuff, you need to find the funding to support your flight &ndash; you think it&rsquo;s a great idea, but how many others do? Luckily, it&rsquo;s a time of great interest in flight and pilots, so finding some funding shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem. Finding enough funding, though &ndash; that&rsquo;s tricky. And then, Mother Nature awaits. Will she look kindly on your route-finding flight?<br/><br/>Game play in Route-Finder: Intercontinental involves using 2D6 and look up tables to find your sponsors and Finance, which allows you to buy the parts for your aeroplane. Choosing these depends on the route you intend to fly - will it be land or water based, short or long hops? But you need to track how much Finance you've used - you'll need a lot during the flight for refuelling, repairs, etc. Once your aeroplane's ready to go, your flight is a series of flight legs and city stopovers, with your aeroplanes technologies and 2D6 rolls and look up tables determining what happens during each. If you manage your Finance right, keep your aeroplane in good order, and choose your Route wisely, you might just find your Route.<br/><br/>Multi-player mode can be co-operative or competitive. Several players can play as different members of the same crew, each bringing different strengths to the challenge, and sharing in the decision making. Or each player could fly their own aeroplane, the pilot who arrives in the least number of Days being the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Cromwell tank was one of a series of cruiser tanks fielded by the British in World War II. The concept of cruiser tanks was that they would combine speed with numbers, allowing the to swarm the enemy and overwhelm them. First deployed during the invasion of Normandy it found a natural home in the reconnaissance regiments where its excellent speed and low profile made it difficult to hit.<br/><br/>The Cromwell Expansion Pack includes the same great model from the Starter Set but has a new range of cards that you can use to equip and personalize your tank on the battlefield. Straight out of the pack, the Cromwell as excellent Mobility and the best base Initiative of any tank currently in the game.<br/><br/>Like the T-34 this combination of stats tends to make the Cromwell somewhat of an apex predator, able to hunt down other tanks with ease. Of course being awesome comes at a price, or in World of Tanks: Miniatures Game terms, a high Cost. This means you may not be able to afford many additional cards to equip your tank unless you plan ahead.<br/><br/>If you do want to enhance the natural stats of the tank there are some great options in the pack, including Vertical Stabilizer which helps to make the tank more accurate when moving slowly, that will work well to enhance this already formidable tank.<br/><br/>Inside the Cromwell Expansion Pack you will find a highly detailed, assembled, painted plastic Cromwell miniature and tank card. Your tank can be further personalized to match your requirements using the five crew, module and upgrade cards included.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

Players have just moved to the small town of Carbondale, and lay cards in a grid representing the social and business networks they are working to develop. By playing clubs, they can win hearts; by buying spades, they can gain diamonds. The winner is the first to have in their networks three hearts and seven diamonds, or three diamonds and seven hearts. If a card in a player's network is not sufficiently protected, it is vulnerable to take-over by opponents. Players will need skill in tile-laying to advance quickly and safely, and will have to carefully manage their hand to balance cards for offense, defense, and building.<br/><br/>The only equipment required is standard decks of cards.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From 1904 to 1905, Japan fought a war with the great power Russia. This was over 100 years ago.<br/><br/>&quot;Russo-Japanese Campaign&quot; is a game based on the Russo-Japanese War. The player becomes the commander of the Japanese or Russian army and fights to lead the player's army to victory.<br/><br/>The most important point in this game is &quot;supply&quot;.<br/><br/>The troops need supplies to fight and to recover from damage. However, the Japanese army is restricted to using ships to get supplies, so they have to fight and win against the Russian Navy. The Russians, on the other hand, relied on the single Siberian railroad, so their supplies were not plentiful.<br/><br/>Thus, the two armies will have to worry about how to use their limited supplies.<br/>While the land battle part is simple, with repeated movement and combat, the aforementioned supply constraints force you to make decisions about where to focus your efforts. In addition, the Japanese forces must decide whether to aim for the early capture of Liaoyang and Mukden, or to prioritize the fall of Lushun.<br/><br/>The naval battle part is directly related to the acquisition of supplies by the Japanese forces, and the response of the Japanese forces will also change depending on the operational policy of the Russian Navy. However, in any case, if the Russian Fleet in Lushun is not destroyed before the Baltic Fleet arrives, Japan will be in a tight spot.<br/><br/>There are also tactical cards that add variety to the game. Tactical cards give you additional supplies, or give you an advantage in battle. Depending on how you use these tactical cards, the battlefield can change dramatically.<br/><br/>Victory or defeat in the game is determined by the victory points (VP) earned by the Japanese army. You can earn victory points by capturing strategically important points such as Liaoyang and Mukden, but you will be penalized if your troops are damaged or if you fail to capture important points.<br/><br/>Will you be able to lead your country to victory!?<br/><br/>",

It does not correspond exactly to the wars of Louis XIV, but concerns the future monarch because this event forged his character and participated in his absolutism. Casus belli: taking advantage of the weakness of royal power while Louis, the future Louis XIV, was still a minor, the parliament of Paris and the nobility (called the Princes) revolted at different periods and to different degrees against the regency ensured by Anne of Austria (widow of Louis XIII) and Cardinal Mazarin, hated by all. This weakening of France is a boon for Spain, still at war with France, to recover territories (Catalonia, Roussillon, the North of France).<br/><br/>The kingdom of France represents the party of the Regent Anne of Austria, Cardinal Mazarin and the king's faithful (some military leaders move from one camp to another) and their allies (Duchy of Savoy, some German states, etc. .).<br/>Spain represents the party that brings together the princes as well as the various allies (other German states, Duchy of Lorraine, etc.); for simplicity this party is called the Coalition.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It has been created by V&iacute;ctor Garrido and Pablo C&aacute;rcamo, illustrated by Juanca Cort&eacute;s, and edited by Boreal Ediciones.<br/><br/>Dra. Motus is a leading scientist who has dedicated her life to making robots capables of behaving like human beings. After years of work and effort, she has managed to give life to &quot;the Cordis&quot;, fabulous creatures with great knowledge but who are still learning about the emotions of humans. To check the emotional abilities of the Cordis, Dra. Motus has designed a series of questions that must be answered through beautiful illustrations in order to interpret the emotions of the other players.<br/><br/>In each of the game modes, you will assume the role of Dra. Motus and question the other players, who will be Cordis looking to show that they understand emotions better than the rest. In this challenge, each Cordis will be equipped with an emotion chip. As in life, different emotions allow us to act in different ways: emotion chips offer Cordis various abilities during the game. Along with this, the illustrations will be great allies to interpret the emotions of Dra. Motus in different situations.<br/><br/>COMPETITIVE MODE<br/>Each player receives 5 image plaques.  One player is Dr Motus, who must pick a situation card. Each situation card has 2 scenarios, and the doctor must choose one of them. Then, every other player must pick one of their image plaques that they believe best represents the feelings of Dr Motus about the situation. Then Dr Motus picks the best one and that player wins a point. Since Dr Motus didn&rsquo;t had the chance to win points, she has the option to face a challenge card.<br/>Then, another player plays the role of Dr. Motus.<br/>In the competitive mode the first person to reach 4/5 victory points (depending on the number of players) will win.<br/><br/>COOPERATIVE MODE<br/>I this mode we display 3 emotions cards in the center of the table and every player receives 3 image plaques. <br/>Dr Motus must pick one of the image plaques and place it on the table, without saying what emotion that cards mean for her. Then, all other players as a team try to guess the correct emotion. If they guess right, they win a point. In the cooperative mode players try to get the best score possible and compare it to a table.<br/><br/>",

You play the role of an air traffic controller, guiding aircraft to their destination while avoiding disaster.<br/><br/>Your airspace is represented on the game board by a 13 x 9 rectangular grid.  Aircraft of various types, chosen randomly from 72 double-sided tiles, continually enter your airspace, moving according to their pre-determined flight plans.  As they travel across the sky in all directions, you can make slight adjustments to their paths.  Your ultimate goal is to safely guide them to their destination, but the number of adjustments you can make is limited, and new aircraft enter your airspace every round.<br/><br/>In the Solo Game, you earn points by safely guiding aircraft to their home destinations.  Earn enough points and you&rsquo;ll impress your boss and win the game.  Make a wrong decision, though, and the aircraft may be involved in a Close Call, requiring them to be grounded and putting a permanent stain on your performance record.  Too many of those and you&rsquo;ll ultimately get fired&mdash;and lose the game.<br/><br/>To add to the challenge, there are also hot air balloon tiles in the bag.  Balloons move with the wind, which can change directions each round.  You can&rsquo;t control the balloons&mdash;your only recourse is to guide the other aircraft around them.  And if that&rsquo;s not enough of a challenge, you can choose to add a drone, which moves randomly, radar interference zones, which prevent you from making any adjustments, and flight plan changes, which alter the home destination for an aircraft.<br/><br/>In the 2-player variant, you compete with another air traffic controller to determine who&rsquo;s better at your job.  You each control your own fleet of aircraft as well as a neutral set.  There are two ways to win:  Perform well enough to convince your boss you&rsquo;re the best, or cause your opponent to look so bad that they get fired.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Three target cards are drawn and placed face up in plain sight.<br/><br/>The youngest player begins by drawing a colour card from one of the piles and inserting it in a row or column of the 4x4 square, shifting the entire row or column. The colour card ejected from the square is removed and set aside. The goal is to replicate on the square one of the sequences shown on the three target cards.<br/><br/>Once a player finds one of the three target sequences in the square, they win the target card, draw another target card from the pile and place it face up above the square so that there are always three target cards showing. When the pile of colour cards runs out, players draw from the discarded colour card piles. it is evident that, by shifting the rows and columns on the square, each player must consider the new position of the colour cards that can then allow the representation of one of the target cards.<br/><br/>The winner is whoever earns 15 points first, summing the value ofthe target cards won (or more, if the players decide differently before starting the game). Target cards are worth 3, 4 or 5 points based on the number of colored squares in the sequence. Before starting players could also decide that the player with the most points wins when all the target cards (or a certain number of them established by the players) are drawn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With the basic game style, it's 1-on-1. You versus your opponent. Each player randomly draws a character and a weapon. These cards have 3 different  traits (Speed, Power, and Finesse). These traits correspond to the dice you will use when battling, so a 4 is a d4, a 6 is a d6, and so forth. When you fight, you roll 1d4 to determine which attack you will use against your enemy.<br/><br/>1 = Speed (Red). 2 = Power (White). 3 = Finesse (Grey). 4 = You choose the attack, or Roll to select again with a Bonus (Green)<br/><br/>Since your weapon and character both have traits, you will actually be rolling 2 dice per attack. If a 1 was rolled on your 1d4 for attack selection for the round, you would use Speed as your attack. Your opponent might have a different trait they are using against you, since they also roll 1d4 to determine which type of attack they will use. You might have 1d4 for your character's Speed, but 1d8 for your weapon's speed. You roll these 2 dice together, add them together, and compare to your opponent's total from their 2 dice.  Damage is dealt in the difference between the two sums.<br/><br/>Strategy comes from things like:<br/><br/>Blocks - double your dice total but you can't damage your opponent. Typically you get 1 block per match, so use it wisely!<br/> Max Dice Damage - even if you're rolling 2D4 vs. an opponent's 1D8 and 1D10, you can still deal damage to them if you max out either or both of your dice! Whenever a character rolls the highest number possible on any die, they deal an automatic point of damage to their opponent. In this way, there is a chance to deal damage to an opponent even if you don't win the round.<br/> Weapon Bonuses - Most characters have 2-3 weapons they have +1 to dice rolls on if they have a matching weapon.<br/> Choice Bonuses - Each character can also get a bonus to attack rolls if they give up their choice when they roll a d4 and get a 4 for attack selection. If so, they roll again and have to take whatever they get, but they attack with a bonus on their rolls.<br/> Alternate Rules Cards - Putting one of these into play at the beginning of a match can totally change the game mechanics. With 36 different variations, it can really put a new spin on things! These are my favorite part of the game.<br/> Special Characters - 9 of the 27 characters have no weapon bonuses, but instead have special powers or abilities.<br/> 3-on-3 Elimination Matches - Continue fighting with your characters until they are reduced to 0 Hit Points, pulling a new character into the match until either you or your opponents have lost 3 characters.<br/> 3-5 Player Battle Royale Matches - Alternate rules for playing with more than 1 opponent. Last one standing wins!<br/>With all of these options, this becomes a great game for 2-5 players, whether you only have 10 minutes to play or an hour.  All it takes is 1 set of 90 cards, some standard RPG dice (D4/D6/D8/D10/D12/D20), and a friend!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;re throwing a dinner party, and your best friend&rsquo;s spouse is allergic!<br/>But making cats do what you want is never as simple as it should be.<br/><br/>The goal of this push-your-luck, pickup-and-deliver game is to put all your cats upstairs at the same time for the night and get them to stay there while their mood swings. You do this by picking them up, but first you must distract them by appealing to their mood.<br/>Each turn, all the cats will have their mood swings, and then move, act or react accordingly. Then you can move around, opening and closing doors, moving toys and getting food and water where a cat will see it, and, if you played your odds right, pick up some cats to take them upstairs.<br/><br/>But they won't stay there forever - if they feel strongly about something, they'll come downstairs again, looking to satisfy their urges. So you need to hurry and put all the rest away quickly.<br/><br/>As if that wasn't enough, your time is limited: your visitors are arriving soon, and if you don't manage to get all the cats upstairs before the mood cards run out, they'll crash your party the entire night. Good luck getting your guests to enjoy their dinner...!<br/><br/>AWARDS<br/>3rd place Best Overall Game in the 2021 Solitaire Print and Play Contest!!<br/><br/>Additionally:<br/>- 1st place Best AI<br/>- 1st place Best Regular PnP Build<br/>- 3rd place Best Use of Theme<br/>- 6th place Most Innovative Mechanics<br/>- 6th place Best Original Art<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The turn of the twenty-second century was a time of great progression of the human race, space exploration, scientific and technological advancements. It was also the time of neo-colonialism, and a new order emerging from the pyres of the old world. It was a time of a new breed of war &ndash; the Hardwar.<br/><br/>Hardwar tries to recreate possible future ground battlefield conditions, providing straightforward rules allowing for a fast-paced tactical experience in a relatively hard science fiction setting. Hardwar takes into account not only classic armoured warfare, enriched with fictional contraptions like mechs, spaceships, or exotic weapons, but also futuristic predictions of combat evolution &ndash; the importance of cybernetic warfare, decline in numbers of human soldiers replaced with AI algorithms, a rise of sentient combat swarms and electronic fog of war, or experimental development of new exotic weapons, to name a few. This approach, combined with simple and flexible rules should provide new and exciting tactical opportunities for tabletop commanders.<br/><br/>Aside from this rulebook, all that is needed for a game is a couple of miniatures, representing your battle group, a handful of twelve-sided dice and another one of small tokens or coins, measuring tape, a table, a couple of terrain pieces and, most importantly, an opponent.<br/><br/>Becoming a force commander in Hardwar world is not a difficult task. You can start your own private security company, lease a few war machines and go out there, looking for contracts from the big fish. You can be a corporate commander,  working for one of the major forces of your world, executing the will of shareholders by all means necessary. You can become the charismatic leader of revolutionary forces, fighting against corporate overlords. You can be a small-time dictator in an area of wastelands forgotten by transnationals, or a noble self-appointed marshal, trying to protect helpless civilians from raiders. You can be a pirate, you can be a bounty hunter, you can be a mercenary.  All you need is to get your hands on some equipment, find a few reliable hardware operators and convince someone with money to let you solve their problem. If you are good enough, you can get additional contracts with media, to make a reality holo-show about your group, you can get sponsors from the arms industry, agents and lawyers to negotiate your contracts, and that penthouse mansion in the orbital city you have always dreamt of.<br/><br/>Your force will face other security consultants, fighting for other employers. Sometimes you will take part in internal power struggles, sometimes you will perform a hostile takeover, sometimes you will sabotage a competitive facility, sometimes you will have to deal with locals unwilling to relocate from your employer&rsquo;s property, sometimes you will go on bandit hunt, you will extinguish, or incite revolution&hellip; it will not always be pretty, but surely will be profitable.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Multiply your impact by cutting transfer delays and installing dedicated bus lanes. The player who builds the most connections wins!<br/><br/>Initially setup with the current situation of city and transit delays, then use dice to pick where to put housing. Each turn the player has ways to remove transfer delays or to place more homes, jobs, or activities. Score is based on how closely connected those homes, jobs, and activities are, not just to one player's set.<br/><br/>",

Increasing possibilities: more monsters, more items, increased dungeon, and gameplay for up to 8 players.<br/><br/>Each Deck contains 54 cards<br/>separated by color on the back, containing:*<br/>Dungeon<br/>Heroes<br/>monsters<br/>Accessories -Pet<br/>Action/Attribute Cards<br/>Gold bags<br/><br/>The game can be played by up to 4 Players per Deck. It is modular and infinity, so With more Decks, More Players, and big the map gets, and items are scarce in each deck making the adventure much more difficult, more decks, more items. (See the example on the photo with 4 Decks Integrate)<br/><br/>To win depends a lot on how you play.<br/><br/>ARENA:<br/><br/>The game becomes an arena, but to start the confrontations you need to walk through the dungeon, which contains items and monsters that can give advantages and disadvantages throughout the game. You win the match: beating the Boss (Boss) or eliminating all opponents in direct confrontation.<br/><br/>Coop (All against the game):<br/><br/>In this mode, you can help your friends to defeat all the monsters in the game and the mighty Bosso (Boss)<br/><br/>Solo mode:<br/><br/>As the title says, single player, you face all the difficulties of the game alone* (you can add the hero cards that are left in the items and during the game so you can find companions to join the adventure and help you in the battle against the incredible monsters that appear in front of you). You win the match by eliminating the Boss (Boss)<br/><br/>The game is a modular game, with you adding more decks, the bigger the adventure gets, with another theme the map gets huge and the difficult gets hard!<br/><br/>",

Specific units and their strengths are hidden from your opponent as you perform a tense dance of cat-and-mouse maneuvers. This is especially important when modeling George McClellan&rsquo;s ill-fated Peninsula Campaign, where doubts about enemy numbers and positions exacerbated the extreme caution that saw the promise of &ldquo;the young Napoleon&rdquo; give way over the course of these operations to his reputation as a passive, bewildered commander who was hopelessly outmatched by his Confederate counterparts. If they want to succeed, the Union Player will need to be bolder and more decisive than Mac; the Confederate Player, for their part, must use a skillful mix of maneuver, bluff, and nerve to stymie the enemy&rsquo;s advance on Richmond. Knowing when to attack and when to hold back, when to run and when to make a stand, are paramount, and as ever, subject to the fortunes of war.<br/><br/>",

Wordplay challenges meet area-control gameplay as 1-4 players race to claim words on the board before their opponents, blocking other players' moves on the way and claiming bonuses wherever possible.  Choose your words wisely - the game depends on it!<br/><br/>Play starts by revealing a challenge card, for example 'words with the blend CK' and each come up with a 5-letter word that fits, e.g. cloCK.  Players then take it in turns to move their pieces on the board, aiming to line them up with all the letters in their word and declare &quot;Spell Out!&quot; before their opponents can do the same.<br/><br/>Letters on the outer ring win you a bonus token if you can get them into a word, and you can exchange it later for an extra turn, but beware! Spent tokens are claimed by opponents, potentially handing them a very useful extra move!<br/><br/>With bounce spaces for advanced movement strategies, randomised start positions and two difficulty levels of cards, Spell Out is the always-fresh word game for families and groups of all ages, skilful wordsmiths and seasoned gamers alike.<br/><br/>Spell Out also includes a Solo Challenge Mode and multiple optional play variants.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Your team strategy will never be the same twice as the Hi MiLo! Deck is shuffled between rounds creating a whole new set of rules for every game!  After seeing their cards, players bid to take the highest, middle, and lowest number of tricks in a round.  Without discussing their cards, players work cooperatively to take tricks which would allow each player to make their bid.  If all players successfully make their bids, the team wins together!<br/><br/>Cardplay Overview<br/>Hi Milo! is a trick-taking game like Hearts, Spades, or Bridge, and follows many of the same rules as those classic games.  Each player places one card face up on the table and one wins the trick based on the value of the cards.  However, Hi Milo! is unique in that the Hi Milo! Deck determines the rules for which cards you can play and which cards will win any trick.  The Win Card for the trick is collected by the winner of the trick, and the next Win Card determines the rules for the next trick.  The Win Card determines the rules for a trick in two ways.  First, players must play a card of the same suit as the Win Card if possible.  If the Win Card has no suit, players can play any cards and only the number value determines the winner.  Second, the rank of the Win Card determines who wins the trick.  If the Win Card is ranked &ldquo;Hi&rdquo;, the highest value card wins the trick.  If it is &ldquo;Lo&rdquo;, the lowest value card wins the trick.  If it is &ldquo;Mi&rdquo;, the player who played the card in the middle of the highest and lowest cards wins the trick.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "World War II was scheduled to begin on 28 September 1938, when German armies would cross into neighboring Czechoslovakia. Unexpectedly, Britain and France agreed to almost all German demands, and the Munich Agreement caused the Germans to cancel their plans.<br/><br/>The Czech Army numbered 1.5 million men, with 17 regular and 17 more reserve infantry divisions and four &ldquo;rapid&rdquo; divisions. Their tanks and artillery greatly out-classed those of the Germans. Germany had a paper strength of 3.3 million men, though thanks to the rapid expansion of the German Army not all of these were as yet fully trained. The Czechs would be fighting for their homeland, behind a thick line of modern fortifications sited in harsh terrain, and many of the Army&rsquo;s leaders as well as rank-and-file were not only willing but eager to fight the Germans. The Benes government, almost completely surrounded by German-controlled territory, instead yielded.<br/><br/>That doesn&rsquo;t happen in Panzer Grenadier: Peace in Our Time. The Czechs fight, and they fight very hard. The Czech Army is well-equipped with tanks, soft vehicles, artillery, anti-tank guns and super-heavy machine guns. You get 176 new pieces and ten new scenarios, all based on battles that could have happened, according to the detailed war plans of both sides.<br/><br/>Panzer Grenadier: Peace in Our Time is a free download; you&rsquo;ll have to assemble the pieces yourself.

What crazy things might you be up to when you and your friends are Left Unsupervised?<br/><br/>Here's how gameplay works:<br/>- Each player gets 5 yellow cards and 5 red cards.<br/>- Choose a player to be the judge for the first round.<br/>- The judge rolls the special die and determines which player the arrow on the die is pointing to.<br/>- That player is the unsupervised player for this turn.<br/>- The judge chooses any card from their hand to play about the unsupervised player.<br/>- This creates part of a story: &quot;Brad [blank] and that's how legends are made.&quot;<br/>- All other players play a card to complete the story and the judge picks their favorite.<br/>- Cards are replenished and the judging role moves to the next player.<br/><br/>Think of Left Unsupervised as kind of like *that other* similar party card game, but staring the players at the table.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game simulates the largest battle of the Polish Defensive War of 1939. The battle was fought near the Bzura River, west of Warsaw, between 9 and 19 September, 1939. The first stage of the battle was a Polish counter-offensive, which was successful. However, gradually, the Germans managed to halt it, outflanking the Polish forces and counter-attacking. Eventually, as a result of the battle, Polish PoznaÅ and Pomorze Armies that took part in the battle were destroyed. The road to Warsaw was now open to German armies marching from Silesia.<br/><br/>This is a new edition of the &quot;Bzura 1939&quot; game that is based on the WB-95 wargaming system developed by Taktyka i Strategia. The previous editions of the game were based on different wargaming systems (e.g. W-39).<br/><br/>",

World War II in Europe does not begin September of that year. Instead, Hitler waits until War Plan Z is complete (in various stages). The game is a strategic two player simulation of the ensuing hypothetical naval campaigns fought between the Germans and the Allies sometime in the 1940s. One assumption of the game is that since Germany concentrates on increasing the Navy, there is no campaign in the west, so France remains an Allied power. Germany and the USSR still divide Poland, and an uneasy peace remains in effect on the Eastern Front.<br/><br/>The game system shows the effects of various operations. Players conduct actions that encompass discrete combat, logistical, intelligence and other operations. A player can conduct one or more actions per turn, depending on control of bases.<br/><br/>Each area on the map is about 550 miles across. Each turn represents one month of operations. Ship units represent two fleet aircraft carriers, divisions of two or three battleships, four to eight cruisers, flotillas of 19-40 destroyers, or various numbers of other ship types. Most ground units in the game represent corps or divisions. Aircraft units represent six to twelve squadrons of aircraft.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ll flip over a card for a category (for this example, Animal) and then roll the die for the number of letters (let&rsquo;s say 6). You have 60 seconds to give a 6 Letter Animal. Your score is based on the letters used in your answer.  If you were to write down &ldquo;Walrus&rdquo;, you would receive 22 points, because...<br/><br/>W = 10 Points<br/><br/>A = 1 Point<br/><br/>L = 2 Points<br/><br/>R = 2 Points<br/><br/>U = 5 Points<br/><br/>S = 2 Points.<br/><br/>But there's a catch!

But beware, fly too high and the sun will melt the wax that holds your wings together... fly too low and the moisture from the sea will make the feathers too heavy to keep you aloft.<br/><br/>Flight of Icarus is a fast-paced strategy game for 2-4 players in which you live out the classic Icarus myth. Build your wings, then brave the elements as you attempt to fly from Crete to the Greek mainland. During the first phase of the game you will collect wax and feathers using an action point system, managing these resources as you craft your wings. You may also play innovations to aid you during your flight. Then, you will take to the air, struggling against both the weather and your fellow fliers during the tactical phase of the game. Bid for the oracle's favor, that allows you to play weather cards and act first, as you jockey for position in the air.<br/><br/>An engaging mixture of strategic resource management and take-that mechanics, Flight of Icarus is fully language independent during play. Even should you fail in your flight, there is no player elimination, so you can still attempt to stop your competition from reaching the other shore.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The campaign was carried out through over a dozen of daylight attacks by Savoia Marchetti SM.79s of the 8th Group &ldquo;Falchi delle Baleari&rdquo; and night-time bombardments by Savoia Marchetti SM.81s of the XXV Autonomous Night Bombing Group &ldquo;Pipistrelli delle Baleari&rdquo; taking off from Mallorca.<br/><br/>The player must plan in advance their air raids to some sectors of the city with the airplanes available each turn and manage to demoralize the city of Barcelona in a maximum of six turns. Failing to do this by the end turn 6 is a loss, which is the historical result. While the bombardments did inflict a lot of casualties and physical damage to the buildings and infrastructures, the population barely fled Barcelona, nor took the streets to force the government to capitulate.<br/><br/>",

Choose 1 of 4 Game Modes to experience this puzzly, set collection game of &quot;cute horror.&quot;<br/><br/>As a Midnight Guardian, you alone stand between the innocent critters of Shady Valley and Zumoffa, Lord of Night. Zumoffa has manifested a great Wall of Pain, but a curse holds sway over the Lord of Night. Zumoffa is incapable of harming anyone found asleep.<br/><br/>Each Day Phase, you must act quickly to meet the critters' needs so they can get to sleep when night comes. You do this by collecting the food and comfort items they seek, and locating potent treasures to help speed up your work and slow down your enemies. If you don't find what you need in the field, sometimes a small roadside stand has just the thing. Its prices fluctuate frequently, but sometimes that can work in your favor.<br/><br/>Each Night Phase, the Wall of Pain slithers down over the valley like a forest fire, consuming one-quarter of the playing field, including resources and unsaved critters, which bolsters the wall's power. Dark Seeds grow here and there, empowering the wall further. House-sized metal monstrosities called &quot;Little Horrors&quot; herald Zumoffa's approach by capturing critters in cages. The tension ramps up as the resources dwindle.<br/><br/>Additional options and challenges are available using the Event deck, which temporarily alters certain rules or introduces new ones while hinting at the larger story and the wonders of the technomagical world of Toonaria.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Cards are set in 6 piles, 3 piles acting as the column headers, 3 for row headers, with cards dealt to fill in the grid in the middle. When a card is in the column or row heading, it is shown bunny-side up. When flipping cards over to fill in the grid, they show as food side up (which also has bunny drops mixed in).<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose one column or one row to take. They get the bunny from the header and the combo of food and bunny drops from the remainder of the column or row they have taken. Each bunny has certain food requirements. Once a player collects 8 bunnies, the game end is triggered. Final scoring is 1pt for each food item given to a bunny to feed them and - 1 pt for each left over food item, and less the food item value of any rabbits not completely fed!<br/><br/>Will you feed the most bunnies or will you get caught cleaning up a mess?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BRO, you've got only TWO weeks 'til the comp! Time to get serious about getting RIPPED. You gotta dig DEEP and max out those SICK GAINS if you wanna be the most YOKED bro on stage. But whatever you do, bro, DON'T skip leg day. A JACKED upper body wows the judges, but NOBODY likes chicken legs, bro.<br/><br/>Don't Skip Leg Day is a competitive game for 3-6 players, although you can add sets to increase the player count. The game is played over two rounds (weeks) consisting of seven turns (days). Each turn, all players select one card from their hand to keep, then pass the rest of their hand to another player. Players repeat this action (keeping a card and passing the ones they don't want) until all players have chosen seven cards. Some of the cards you choose to keep will be made public to all players, but many will remain a secret until the end of the game.<br/><br/>After two rounds, everyone's full collection of cards is revealed and scored based on a variety of scoring methods. The player with the fewest &quot;Leg Day&quot; exercises is eliminated from the competition. After that, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You will venture inside and traverse through multiple floors and into its depths. Your goal is to clear each floor, defeat the creatures within, and collect treasure.<br/><br/>Each turn, you will roll to determine your type and amount of movement. As you pass through each square you will resolve interactions as they take place such as collecting weapons and items or fighting an enemy. You continue through each floor until you find the exit. You can use collected items/weapons, gain levels, and roll against traps, enemies, and bosses.<br/><br/>The game is over at the end of any floor when you wish to stop, or after five floors have been cleared. Count up all of the points you've earned on each floor to determine your total score. Compare this score to our ranking system to be awarded a title such as &quot;seasoned adventurer&quot;.<br/><br/>The map size and difficulty increase as you get deeper into the cavern, so keep an eye to your hearts and be wary of the number of enemies you want to take on. If you lose your hearts, it's game over.  Let your adventure begin.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The more complex the elevating tower builds, the less stable it is bringing extra tension to this fast paced party-game.  <br/>The shape of the wooden block to be installed by the player is determined by the roll of a die. Players are requested to build their trees with the corresponding colors fitting to each other.<br/>The game ends if the structure collapses or a block falls out from the tower or all blocks have been installed.<br/>The winner is, who has the tallest tree, i.e. whose wooden block reaches the highest in the structure before the game ends.<br/><br/>This fast pace, high tension party-game makes family members of different ages playing together.<br/><br/>(Solo mode: pack the supporting base and the 44 wooden pieces back in to the tin container by solving this challenging 3D puzzle.)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Face rival archeologists in a race to unlock an ancient temple's forgotten secrets. Before you can lay hands on the invaluable treasure it's holding, you have to deduce the combinations of statuettes unlocking the hidden vault!<br/><br/>At the beginning of Temple Code, each player receives a combination card with a series of three unique statuettes that everyone can see but themselves. Each round, two combination cards are dealt face-up in front of each player. On your turn, pick a set of cards in front of another player, then take one for yourself and give them the other one. By aligning this card next to the one you're trying to guess, you will get hints about the matching statuettes: each blue circle indicates a statuette that is on both cards at the same place, and each orange triangle stands for a statuette that is on both cards, but in different positions.<br/><br/>At any time during the game, a player can guess the card in front of them. Whether they guessed correctly or not, they receive a new combination card to guess.<br/><br/>Whoever first correctly guesses two combinations wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Cultists and servitors worship the dread Ancient Ones and seek to extend their influence on earth. Secret societies conduct dark rituals in hidden chambers beneath public notice, criminals buy and sell eldritch relics on the black market, and otherworldly creatures flit through the dimensions, existing beyond the realm of human perception.<br/><br/>Written and Bound introduces 60 new cards (three copies each of 20 cards) that reinforce the power of knowledge and the importance of knowledge seekers in the Call of Cthulhu mythos. New Tome cards, a Library, Criminals, Scientists, Investigators, and Relic Hunters all provide the different factions powerful new ways to use knowledge to manipulate the world to their own ends &ndash; or to liberate it from the Ancient One's ever-tightening grasp.<br/><br/>",

Move, attack other heroes and regions,use of objects and drawing prospective card only while in the course of your move. It is also not allowed and move and perform some action in the same turn. If during the movement meet with other heroes, you can attack it, do nothing or make a trade. Trump can exchange items, equipment, regions, etc., but not tasks. Battles are resolved classic throwing two dice (with the would-be certain bonuses and minuses), but you automatically lose if you get two aces,while  with two sixes you automatically win the battle. There are also various other accessories that enrich the game: Treasury, shortcuts, dungeons, sanctuaries, teleport, an abyss ...<br/><br/>Despite this wealth of options, the game is very simple and the rules are very easy to learn and leave no room for doubts. Game will even complete inexperienced players quite soon. In addition, Satirik is a very addictive game and it will certainly  hold your attention for a long time. We recommend a game with as many players so you can add more excitement to the party (and last much longer).<br/><br/>",

The game provides FFA, team mode, and solo mode with AI enemies.<br/><br/>Players use a variety of weapons and strategies to fight to the land man standing.<br/><br/>Each round, players spend staminas to move, loot, and attack other competitors to eliminate them and keep themselves safe.<br/><br/>When you attack, you choose a weapon that fits the range and roll the dice. Each face of the die shows which part of the body you hit.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, the blue zone narrows and the playing area shrinks. Players may utilize vehicles on the map to move faster and take advantage of the available terrains.<br/><br/>There are items that are attached to your firearm to enhance the weapons. Other items can be used on yourself or thrown.<br/><br/>You win if you survive to the end and become the last man standing.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "KiCKeT is a football simulation game based on tactical movement of miniatures. The game is played with the feet: miniatures movement, passes and shots on goal, goalkeeper defence are all performed with one foot.<br/><br/>The game is about to get published and several versions of the box are envisaged. The boxes only differ in terms of amount of components, i.e. the number miniatures and the addition or not of various accessories.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Standard&quot; components:<br/>- 2 or 4 wooden miniature field players, 20 cm high<br/>- 2 wooden miniature goalkeepers, 20 cm high<br/>- 2 goals of adjustable size<br/>- 1 small fake-leather ball, soft inflated (no risk of damage&hellip;)<br/>- markers for field and goal area corners<br/><br/>The game is playable on many surfaces: grass, carpet, parquet floor (with the &ldquo;socks&rdquo; accessory), cement, even sand !<br/><br/>The number of miniatures should be adapted to the field size, e.g. 2x3 m with 2 field players and a goalkeeper, 4x6 m with 4 field players and a goalkeeper.<br/><br/>As for human players, they can of course play 1-on-1, but playing 2-on-2 works perfectly, and with more players also assuming more miniatures (and space) are available. An atmosphere of table football played with the feet, or of giant, say, 8-players football table.<br/><br/>Basic rules:<br/>- players take turns, and have 2 actions per turn<br/>- possible actions are: move a miniature, or play the ball; the ball can be played directly with the foot, or a miniature can be pushed such that it moves the ball<br/>- to be allowed to kick the ball, it must first be under control: a miniature controls the ball if one foot cannot be inserted between the miniature and the ball<br/>- a shot on goal can be taken at any time, if the ball is under control; the intention to shoot must be announced<br/>- the opponent can defend his goal with one foot; his other foot must stay planted behind the goal<br/>- any contact with another miniature is a foul, which ends the turn<br/><br/>Other simple and logical rules take care of particular circumstances, in order to keep the flow of the game going.<br/><br/>",

In contrast, areas unexplored will tarnish your reputation. When everyone has finished exploring the island, the explorer with the highest victory points wins.<br/><br/>The game is played through a series of rounds. Each round, players plan their day choosing to rest, move or research. One player will roll all 5 movement dice, players who chose to move can select a die result to explore Isla, those who rest can recover their lowest value die, and those who chose to research will select a card showing the flora, fauna or fossil they&rsquo;ve discovered to earn themselves reputation points. But it's not so easy, the further you travel through the jungle, you may stumble over a branch, pick up a poisonous plant or discover you may not be alone on the island. As explorers, you are tasked with researching the species you discover so hurry before someone else claims the discovery!<br/><br/>An explorative roll and write game in which players uncover the mysteries of a curious island whilst battling exhaustion.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Funkoverse uses an innovative &ldquo;cooldown&rdquo; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for the different game scenario.<br/><br/>Race to the finish line in Red Light, Green Light, or try to burst past your rivals&rsquo; defenses in The Squid Game!

However, it does play quickly. Our unique grid system allows you to play out an entire race in 20 minutes, once you have learned the rules.<br/><br/>Our grid system compresses each race into segments, making game play smooth, effortless and fast. Do not worry though, you will not miss any of the action. While you will not get all the action in minute detail, you will not miss out on lead changes, wrecks, great pit work, and mechanical problems that shape every race so uniquely. The game also lets you witness the challenges made to the race leader as well as the struggle of back markers to avoid being lapped or to rejoin the lead lap. All this action happens in a linear time span from green to checkered flag.<br/><br/>Fast Action Racing captures every important element of a race, produces very realistic results, and plays very quickly. And best of all, it feels like racing. No dice rolling exercises, no gimmicks, no math equations, or unrealistic tallying of numbers to determine a winner. Fast Action Racing is just that, racing, pure and simple.<br/><br/>The Base Game comes with everything needed to play. (Other than 4 six-sided dice for E-Book purchasers)<br/><br/>The Base Game also comes with the Short Track Legends Year Book, which is the perfect set to learn the game. It brings you 36 of the top short track drivers from all facets of the sport. From open wheel legends like AJ Foyt and Tony Stewart to Stock Car Legends like Ned Jarrett and Junior Johnson to Sprint Car Legends and Saturday Night drivers like Sammy Swindell, Steve Kinser and Frank Kimmel.

The player with the most Prestige at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Diplomatic Pressure (DP) is how you score Prestige. Every card has a DP value. You apply DP by playing cards.  The player with the most Prestige at the end of a turn earns Prestige points. There are other ways of scoring Prestige points too, but this is the most important one.<br/><br/>Tension is how you lose. If you end a turn in the red zone on the Score Track you are also creating Tension for your opponents which reflects how close you are to provoking them into mobilizing for war. If you provoke them too far war starts and you lose.<br/><br/>Cards drive the game.  There are various card types that affect the game as follows:<br/><br/>Assertion Cards- which uses your nation's power to increases your Prestige<br/><br/>Consensus and National Interests  Cards- these allow your nation to play more cards<br/><br/>Diplomatic Back-Channel Cards  - these let you increase DP without increasing Tension<br/><br/>Caution Cards - allow more cards to be drawn<br/><br/>In addition, some cards have recurring effects on  Momentum, which stops players from performing certain actions and Reduce Tension which lets you lower Tension in your country.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Panzer Orders, a World War 2 card game. The game is fast and fun to play and takes around 30 mins. The game includes rules for a two player game and separate rules for the solitaire game.<br/><br/>The game contains two decks of cards - one deck for the Allies and one for the Germans. All of the cards have completely unique artwork with no duplicates. Each card has a points value based on the card characteristics and special rules. The players agree a point based battle and then build their decks, spending points on specific cards.<br/><br/>Each player must form three columns of any mixture of vehicles, tanks, or infantry and then attack the opponents columns. The first player to defeat all three columns or force the opposing player to draw their last card, wins the game.<br/><br/>During the player turn you can choose to dig and defend with your card, moves cards from one column to another or attack with long range or close combat. None of these are without their risks and weighing up the risk vs the strategic gain is part of the decision making elements of the game.<br/><br/>Combat is fast, simple but very brutal with all the dice rolls required on the cards - no charts or looking up in the rules. Damaged cards are suppressed first before being removed from the game and can still make a free saving throw on the dice to keep in the fight.<br/><br/>",

In one game civilizations rise while in the other players battle over whether the great Persian Empire will survive. Both games emphasize simplicity but not at the price of being unrealistic.<br/><br/>From Sumeria to Persia is about the Bronze and Iron Age, when civilization was born and city states went from kingdoms and finally to large empires, culminating in the Persian Empire founded by Cyrus the Great. Players of History of the World will recognize the base mechanics whereby players randomly select civilizations from cards, although the player in last place has more power to decide which civilization they will play.<br/><br/>From Sumeria to Persia does offer players more options than previous games on the subject. Civilizations that survive can continue to expand in future turns. Random events create possibilities that defy history but were in the realm of possibility. The Minoans may have a brilliant military commander and the Egyptians could become a seafaring empire. There are also rules for constructing wonders, the placement of cities, and the general effects of the Bronze Age collapse. Lastly, the Persian Empire does appear.<br/><br/>Alexander vs. Darius: The Fall of the Persian Empire simulates Alexander III&rsquo;s conquest of the great Persian Empire. Sometimes portrayed as a foregone conclusion, this game argues that Persia certainly had a chance to win if they had used different strategies or had some luck on the battlefield. Darius III need not have been Persia&rsquo;s last king.<br/><br/>The heart of Alexander vs. Darius is a war weariness track, which moves down steadily for Alexander&rsquo;s army. Historically, it did not reach zero until after his invasion of India, but a Persian battlefield victory could have changed that. The game also allows players to explore Memnon&rsquo;s strategy of using Persian naval supremacy to raid Alexander&rsquo;s rear as well as exploring the possibilities of the Spartan rebellion. Lastly, the Persians themselves must worry about legitimacy, and therefore must be active in resisting Alexander, or risk losing their grip on the throne.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Build the most beautiful Amsterdam canal houses, full of shops, cats, seagulls and tulips in this fun card game!<br/><br/>Grachtenpand is a light hand drafting game for 2-4 players where you build an idyllic set of canal houses. You build the houses using 'bases', 'floors' and 'roofs'<br/><br/>Each turn, each player simultaneously chooses one card from their hand and builds it, using the rules detailed below.<br/>After building their cards, each player passes the remaining three cards to the player on their left. After receiving a new hand of three cards from the player to their right, each player chooses a type of card (base, front, or roof) and draws one card of that type from the corresponding deck into their hand to refresh it to four cards.<br/><br/>A completed house consists of a base at the bottom, any number of <br/>front cards, and one roof at the top. When building a house, you must build <br/>from the bottom-up (starting with a base and ending with a roof)<br/><br/>When you build a base, you start a new incomplete house by placing it to the left or right of an existing base (or starting your first house if it&rsquo;s the first card you build)<br/><br/>When you build a front, add it to the top of any of your incomplete houses. Once you build a roof, that house is complete, and may not be built any further.<br/><br/>Each player scores points for flowers, colors, bases, and roofs<br/><br/>Flowers: Score 1 point for each window with flowers you have in your tableau<br/><br/>Colors: Find the largest continuous group of cards of one color. Score 1 point for each card in that group.<br/><br/>Bases and Roofs: Each base and roof card in your tableau has a condition and a point value (). If the building this base is a part of meets the condition on the base, you score all the points on the card. If it does not meet the condition, you lose 2 points for this card. Scoring conditions may refer to the number of seagulls, flags, or cats visible on the building. They may also  refer to their own height, or the height of the buildings to their left or right. A building&rsquo;s height is the number of cards in the building (base, fronts, and roof).<br/><br/>",

Mars is an unforgiving world, a barren wasteland on the surface, therefore the people live in vast underground cities known as labyrinths. <br/> Over the years, the people of Mars have formed their own culture and identity and want more say in their own rule. To many, Earth is a remote world with too much control over Martian affairs. Furthermore, Earth&rsquo;s corporations have too much power over life and death. Some long for a green Mars, covered in oceans and life. While others recoil at the idea that humanity will destroy the climate of another planet.<br/> Red Dust Rebellion is volume XII of GMT's acclaimed COIN Series, and tells the story of the Martian revolts of the 2250&rsquo;s and the rise of Martian nationalism.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Do you have what it takes to put a stop to their insidious operations?<br/><br/>In The Feds, players are leaders of FBI units seeking to send agents out to combat crime by arresting criminals. The game is heavily inspired by Gunrunners, an earlier game by the same designer and publisher.<br/><br/>The game is played over a series of rounds. In each round, players simultaneously choose an agent card to play from their hand and a location to play it.  In turn order, players then deploy their agents as moles (face-down) to the chosen locations. If a mole is already at a location, that mole is revealed and is now a &quot;field agent&quot;.  Sometimes, when a mole is revealed, a special power will be performed by the owning player of the mole (some agent cards have powers).  These special powers change from game to game for variety of play (based on the City Card being used for the game). They do such things as forcing criminals to move, redeploying agents to new locations, making small arrests, and so on.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, each location is scored and players arrest criminals based on their agent powers at each location.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

While Classic BattleTech: Starterbook â Sword and Dragon serves as a link between the BattleTech: Introductory Box Set and the full tournament/standard rules found in BattleTech: Total Warfare, Starterbook: Wolf and Blake links Total Warfare to BattleTech: Tactical Operations, the on-world advanced core rulebook. Wolf and Blake also offers an introduction to the current Jihad storyline and to the religiously driven Word of Blake faction. The famed Black Widow Company serves as the opposing force.<br/><br/>Wolf and Blake follows the basic pattern laid out in Sword and Dragon: brief bits of fiction, profiles of each side's history and current Mechwarriors, a rules annex (here previewing some of the advanced rules from TacOps), a &quot;warchest&quot; campaign system, and a series of branching missions that players can explore. The book ends with a series of filled-in record sheets, including variant 'Mechs depicted in the text.<br/><br/>Total Warfare is required to use Starterbook: Wolf and Blake.

To use this product you must have Star Fleet Battles Tournament Book 1991 or later. You will also need the Star Fleet Battles Basic Set. To use some portions you will need Advanced Missions, Module C1, Module C2, Module J and/or Module K.<br/><br/>This 32-page book consists of over a dozen chapters covering tournament tactics for specific tournament cruisers. The chapters, in order, cover Federation, Klingon, Romulan, Kzinti, Gorn, Tholian, Orion, Hydran, Andromedan, Lyran, Wyn, and ISC tactics. There is a final chapter that covers general tournament tactics.<br/><br/>Each chapter has articles written by aces, staffers, and/or unrated players. These articles were published without extensive editing with the intent to accumulate more material and feedback that would be used in a later 1993 publication for Star Fleet Battles.<br/><br/>",

FOGN will cater for both types of player, with a full point system allowing theoretical battles between balanced armies to be played out, as well as accommodating factual scenarios. The rulebook will maintain the same production values as previous FOG and FOGR releases and will be designed both to explain the game and be a reference guide when playing. To make the rules easier to follow, we will include examples, detailed descriptions and explanations of unusual situations in a similar way to our Ancients and Renaissance rulebooks.<br/><br/>Based on the core mechanics of its predecessors, Field of Glory: Napoleonic is a tabletop miniatures game that allows players to command the armies of any of the nations involved in the Napoleonic and French Revolutionary Wars, emphasizing the combined arms tactics that dominated the battlefields of the period. Players will deploy cavalry, infantry, and artillery units to move, fire and assault their way to victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Mini-expansions set expand your experience of Winter Queen and consists of 3 fully compatible mini-expansions that you may use with the game.<br/><br/>This set includes:<br/><br/>&bull; Gratitudes mini-expansion:<br/><br/>This mini-expansion increases player interaction and competitiveness of Winter Queen. We recommend playing your first games without it, though. Gratitudes, when you&rsquo;re ready to use them, will let you experience a new layer of strategy.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, you receive 5 Gratitude tokens. Each of them corresponds to one of the crystal colors. When you place a crystal on a Queendom Map board, you flip the Gratitude token of the corresponding color face up, thus activating it. From now on, you may use it. Each token grants you a special one-time ability. When the token is used, it flips face down... until you retrieve it again by placing the crystal of its color on the Map board. Each Gratitude token is a very powerful tool if used wisely. For example, green token allows you to swap any 2 Queen&rsquo;s Domain tiles on the Map board, and red one can replace up to 3 crystals on the Crystal Holder tiles.<br/><br/>&bull; Royal Jewelry mini-expansion:<br/><br/>This expansion adds a whole new level of strategy. In the base game, crystals from the Spell Books you activate are discarded. Royal Jewelry gives these crystals a second life. After you activate a Spell Book, instead of discarding crystal(s), you move them to your Royal Jewelry card. You may choose to put crystal(s) in the Treasury or add it to your Tiara. At the end of the game the Treasury generates 1 VP for every 2 crystals in it, and The Tiara can generate up to insane 10 VPs!<br/><br/>&bull; Great Wizard solo mini-expansion:<br/><br/>What do wizards do when there are no other wizards to compete with? Well, they perform special quests for their Queen! This solo mini-expansion isâ¯fully compatible with other mini-expansions and allows you to experience almost the same gameplay even when there are no other wizards around.<br/><br/>When you play solo, replace common Spell Books with 8 special ones and remove all but 20 crystals from the game. Create patterns out of enchanted crystals as usual and do your best to score as many VPs as possible. Compare your result with the chart and measure your success on a scale from a mere Charlatan to a truly Great Wizard!<br/><br/>",

Al-Bakr was a significant intelligence gathering post, and a safe haven for the Iraqi missile boats, from which to operate against the Iranian shipping.

We have crafted different rich scenarios by getting inspiration from the mechanisms you most love in board games that will completely change the way you create your beautiful garden. In this expansion, you will find new tiles, decorations, panoramas, visitors, boards, and new components that you have never seen before.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

On your turn you must take 3 actions in any order: Traverse, Tectonic Twist, and Scout (a choice of component actions Explore and Forecast).<br/><br/>These actions allow players to move across the board towards their goal, reorient tiles, and accumulate Tremor Tokens. Tremor Tokens are placed on the separate Catastrophe Board, and players must strategically allocate and optimise them to ignite a disaster.<br/><br/>There are 6 disasters that will help or hinder your passage to safety. Each of them have unique effects, and the area of the board they affect is based on how you manipulate their position and orientation. You can also evade, combo and amplify their effects by using secret Catastrophe Cards, Disaster Die rolls, and abilities unique to your species.<br/><br/>Tremor can be played as a competitive or team co-operative game. It's easy to learn and hard to master, making it suitable for all skill levels. Games last between 30-60 minutes depending on how seriously you take your strategy.<br/><br/>&mdash; Jonah, Curly Bros Games<br/><br/>",

But be careful, one player might secretly be a traitorous Sasquatch seeking to sabotage your trailblazing efforts!<br/><br/>Sasquatch wants to be left alone and will thus do anything he can to keep pesky humans out of his woods &mdash; including undermining trail construction. If there is a Sasquatch in the game, then the other players (humans) want to find him!<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/><br/>     Deal out the secret identity cards. All players are humans, but one player might secretly be Sasquatch.<br/>     On your turn: Play 1 trail card, discard the other facedown into a discard row of your choice. Then draw back up to 2 trail cards.<br/>     If you are Human: Cooperate together to build hiking, biking, and kayaking loops through new hybrid camps to maximize your points&hellip; and keep an eye out for the sneaky Sasquatch.<br/>     If you are Sasquatch: Blend in with the Humans while subtly sabotaging their trails. Reveal yourself when you think you can win, or ride it out until the end-game scoring to determine the victor.<br/>     If Sasquatch is revealed, then Humans must race to build a loop through his location before their turns run out. If Sasquatch is not revealed (or there was no Sasquatch), then Humans tally up their loop points to see if they won.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends after a Sasquatch Hunt or when a discard row is full.<br/><br/>This expansion is compatible with any edition of Trailblazers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Just after Chancellorsville, the biggest cavalry engagement occurred on June 9, 1863. Reorganized Union forces under Pleasanton engaged JEB Stuart's Confederate Cavalry. This game was recently published in the new Panzerschreck issue #14. This is a 9 turn game on a small map with 10 units per side. Should play quickly. The game has initiative, disruption, counterattacks, event chits (which modify a rule or condition). Victory is determined by comparing (at the end of the game) the randomly drawn Victory Chit (by the Union player) with the status at the end of the game. The Confederate player does not know what goal the Union player has. The CRT is relatively bloodless, but you accumulate Disruption Markers which represent losses and reduced combat/maneuver abilities (sort of a step loss system).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Knight's Cross of Iron is a dual pack of two wargames designed by Masahiro Yamazaki. Those games are Paulus' 6th Army and Zitadelle: Duel for Kursk 1943.<br/><br/>Paulus' 6th Army is an operational level simulation of the Soviet encirclement operation named &quot;Operation Uranus&quot; and the German escape attempt from Stalingrad from 19th November to 24th December, 1942. This game represents the first significant operational victory of the previously inferior Soviet Red Army over the Wehrmacht. For this reason, the battle of Stalingrad in often referred to as the &quot;turning point&quot; of World War II. But in this game, the German player has more command options than Friedrich Paulus, the German 6th Army commander. So the German player may withdraw from Stalingrad his troops or may defend more effectively than in the historical static situation.<br/><br/>Zitadelle: Duel for Kursk 1943 is an operational level simulation of the greatest tank battle in history. Beginning on July 5th 1943, strong German forces attempted to cut off the Soviet Kursk salient. Hitler had decided to delay the attack however, until he had sufficient new Panther and Tiger tanks available. During that time, the Soviet forces were reinforced on a scale not seen since World War I, and in addition they knew the details of the German offensive plan. The defenses were deployed on six lines deep. As a result, the German summer offensive named &quot;Zitadelle&quot; (Citadel) was checked, and on 13th July, Hitler informed his generals that Operation Zitadelle was called off.<br/><br/>The original edition of Paulus' 6th Army and Zitadelle: Duel for Kursk 1943 were published by Six Angles in 2005 and 2009 as issue games of #10 and #13. This renewed editions contain improved components; both for counters and game maps.<br/><br/>Scale<br/>â 1 hex: 5.5 kilometers (Paulus' 6th Army) / 3.2 kilometers (Zitadelle)<br/>â 1 turn: 3 days (Paulus' 6th Army) / 1 day (Zitadelle)<br/><br/>Contents<br/>â 2 rule books (32 pages each)<br/>â 2 A1 size color maps<br/>â 5 countersheets (1200 pieces)<br/>â 2 A3 size charts<br/>â 4 A4 size charts<br/>â 2 dice<br/><br/>(source: Six Angles webpage)<br/><br/>",

Event markers placed on the Map will create the needed Fog of War and randomize the placement of enemies, events and of course loot! Terrain rules allow to quickly create different planetary conditions.<br/><br/>Scenarios can be played individually or as part of a Campaign game: in this case a flowchart will (randomly) determine the next mission; as an example, after a &ldquo;Exploration&rdquo; mission a bad roll could send your characters on the &ldquo;Ambush&rdquo; scenario. Characters on a Campaign will be able to improve their characteristics, but with the improvement of the Reputation Level of your Crew, your enemies will also become stronger.<br/><br/>Activation of units (friendly and enemies) is managed with a pool of activation markers, but you can never be sure that every unit will be activated. When an &ldquo;Enemy&rdquo; marker is drawn by the pool you will roll on the ENEMY ACTIVATION table in the current Scenario to determine the unit to activate and its orders.<br/><br/>",

Faster paced than the original and more streamlined, the expansion changes substantially the original gameplay.<br/><br/>Played with La Petite Mort, this expansion asks the players to reach new objectives for their Diploma as the Grim Reaper.They will have to make sure old people are &quot;collected&quot; and avoid the new and young residents, much harder to collect. Adding a new &quot;write&quot; mechanism to the original game, the expansion drastically changes the way the cards are played.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To investigate, nothing more simple. Take a card to take a closer look. An item intrigues you? Flip the card over and find out what is this little paper on the bedside table.<br/><br/>An address? You can now take the card that corresponds to this track. Unless another element on the crime scene appeals you even more ?<br/><br/>In Crime Zoom, you will conduct your investigation freely. Discuss between players to choose the tracks to follow. And as soon as you think you have solved the case, go to the questionnaire. Who is guilty ? What is his mobile ? What is the murder weapon ? And some subsidiary questions, of course.<br/><br/>Do not miss the culprit otherwise you will lose the game. But if you answer the questions correctly, the number of cards you will not reveal will decide you.<br/><br/>The solution will answer each of the questions. The epilogue will come to tell all this in a story or a testimony history to understand the plot that has been played.<br/><br/>Crime Zoom: Fen&ecirc;tre sur crimes is the fifth case of the Crime Zoom family. It brings you in a residence in Los Angeles in 1954. This case is a tribute to Hitchcock famous movie Fen&ecirc;tre sur cour (Rear Window).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To explore the ocean tides, you&rsquo;ll need to chart your journey and draw a number of new Voyage cards; that is the number of moves you can make in the Dungeon that turn.

If you fail to complete a Voyage card, you may receive a penalty that makes your quest that much harder.<br/><br/>The high seas can be an exciting and fearsome place. You never know what islands you&rsquo;ll come across or what dangers you&rsquo;ll encounter. A chance meeting with a merchant ship can provide you with a tremendous boon &hellip; for the right price.

        "description": "WELLINGTON'S WAR presents the entire Peninsular Campaign using wooden blocks on one 32 inch by 48 inch map. The 12 six-month turns cover 1808 to 1814. The 100 blocks represent the military forces ofGreat Britain, Spain, Portugal, and France.<br/><br/>Combat involves dice rolling for hits (No CRT or Battle board needed). The Supply and logistic rules are meant to model the Peninsular War adage that: &quot;In Spain large armies starve, and small ones get beaten&quot;. Winter attrition in the wrong areas can be brutal. Control of areas is key to victory and the French player in particular will contend with conflicting needs of garrisoning key areas while maintaining a sufficiently strong field force.<br/><br/>The map covers Spain, Portugal, and southern France at about 35 miles to the hex. Depicted are the various provinces (rated for political and supply value), the major rivers, mountain ranges, and the key fortresses and towns. Each turn represents 6 months of real time (12 turns in game) and is broken down into Event, Operations, and Administrative phases.<br/><br/>The wooden blocks represent the major military formations that took part in the war generally depicted as Spanish field armies, French divisional and corp sized formations, Anglo-Portuguese divisions, and British expeditionary forces. Leaders include Wellington, Moore, Soult, and even a special guest appearance by Napoleon himself. Special blocks include Major guerrilla formations, The Lines of Torres Vedras, Popham's Naval Squadron, and key fortress garrisons.<br/><br/>A set of 30 event cards allows for random events, historical chrome, and political background. They also help regulate the various nation's force levels in the game. A sampling includes: &quot;The Convention of Cintra&quot;, &quot;Supreme Junta&quot;, &quot;The Emperor Strikes Back&quot;, and &quot;Russian&quot;. War. The game also includes 30 operations cards.<br/><br/>The game has a 12 turn Campaign game scenario, a five turn short game scenario, and a set of optional rules that provide more chrome or can be used to favor one side or the other.<br/><br/>Go to <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.justplain.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.justplain.com</a> for the publisher's website.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Drakerys is a fantasy world where Dwarves, Elves, Orcs and Humans reign over ancient kingdoms. Elemental magic created the world and went into slumber for centuries, leaving myths about dreadful and marvelous creatures ruling over the living. Everybody knows fairies and trolls are just stuff of legends, right? Wrong! A few weeks ago, an adventurer awoke a powerful dragon and triggered a chain of events leading to the destruction of an empire. Magic is returning in a world shaken by sudden chaos. Armies are assembling to repel the awakening creatures and seize power!<br/><br/>In Drakerys, each player chooses a side, gathers miniature troops and takes the lead against other players in story-driven skirmish battles. The terrain setting as well as the victory conditions are laid out by a battle scenario all players agreed upon. The fate of warriors is determined through combat rules and some rolls of dice. As a war leader, you&rsquo;ll need tactical insight - and a bit of luck - to win!<br/><br/>The Starter Box contains everything you'll need to discover miniature games and enjoy Drakerys. Two armies are featured with fully assembled miniatures: the Human Paladins of Irosia and the wild Orcs of Ashral.<br/><br/>As the story begins, they are pitted against each other in a campaign to conquer a mysterious archipelago filled with danger, secrets about the magical events to come, not to mention countless treasures! The winning side will take an important advantage in the beginning war.<br/><br/>The old world is about to crumble. It&rsquo;s a time of heroes. Will you be the king of tomorrow? Find out with Drakerys!<br/><br/>The game uses classic fantasy army building with an fresh twist: players use a special Action Wheel to determine whose turn is it to play and what units can do. The same player can play several times in a row or execute glorious feats at the price of increased risks, or use a more cautions approach to moving his army. This unforeseen game mechanic sets a new vision in fantasy gaming strategies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Theros is a Magic: The Gathering block, consisting of the expansion sets Theros (September 27, 2013), Born of the Gods (February 7, 2014) and Journey into Nyx (May 2, 2014). The block is a &quot;top-down&quot; design inspired by Greek mythology.<br/><br/>The first set of the block, Theros, was released on September 27, 2013. This large set consists of 249 cards, three of which are Planeswalkers: The white Elspeth, Sun's Champion; the blue/black Ashiok, Nightmare Weaver; and the red/green Xenagos, the Reveler. The set contains five of the block's ten &quot;scry lands,&quot; a cycle of dual lands that come into play tapped and allow its controller to Scry 1 when it enters the battlefield. This set also contained a notable reprint in Thoughtseize, previously seen in Lorwyn.<br/><br/>The block introduced several new mechanics and keywords, as well one returning keyword. The following mechanics appear in all sets of the Theros block:<br/><br/>Enchantment Creature and Enchantment Artifact: Cards that are affected by anything that affects enchantments and anything that affects their other type. In addition to having the Enchantment type printed, they are also distinguished by a new starry background representing Nyx.<br/>Heroic: A keyword ability that appears only on creatures. Whenever a creature with Heroic becomes the target of a spell cast by its controller, the ability triggers, causing a one-time effect such as the addition of a specific number of +1/+1 counters or an action that interacts with the opponent's creatures.<br/>Bestow: Bestow is an alternate cost that appears only on Enchantment Creatures. A Bestow creature can be cast for its normal mana cost, or, if cast for its Bestow cost (always more expensive than the converted mana cost), it becomes an Enchantment - Aura spell with Enchant Creature. When attached to a creature, the Bestow card gives the enchanted creature a boost in power and toughness that is equal to the original power and toughness of the Bestow creature, as well as whatever additional abilities and keywords the original had (Flying, Deathtouch, etc.). Whenever the enchanted creature leaves the battlefield, the Bestow card becomes unattached from it and becomes a creature itself.<br/>Devotion: An ability word that checks the number of colored mana symbols among all permanents you control (not including lands) that you have in play. For example, one of the most popular devotion cards of the set, Gray Merchant of Asphodel, has an enters-the-battlefield ability that causes your opponents to lose life, and you to gain life, equal to your devotion to black. Additionally, Theros's pantheon are all played as Enchantments, only becoming creatures if your devotion to their colors has passed a certain threshold.<br/>Scry: A popular keyword that appeared as recently as the Magic 2011 core set, Scry allows players to look at a specified number of cards on top of their library, and choose to put those cards on the top or bottom of their library in the order they choose.<br/>The set also has a unique mechanic that did not appear in Born of the Gods but appears in Journey into Nyx:<br/><br/>Monstrous: an activated ability of creatures that can only be used once per game. When a creature's Monstrous ability is activated, it gains a specified number of +1/+1 counters. Additionally, becoming Monstrous may cause one-time effects on the game state, such as destroying lands or other creatures.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Red Tide South is a two-player game. It is a stand-alone game that can is also designed to be played with Red Tide West (Modern War #15). A war in Europe during the 1980&rsquo;s was primarily going to be decided, one way or the other, in West Germany. Other fronts and theaters were therefore almost irrelevant in the short term. Considering the Soviets&rsquo; exceedingly optimistic timetables by which they intended to overrun West Germany, events elsewhere would have not even played out before the war ended (either by mutual annihilation or by rapprochement). However, the Balkan Front could have had the most direct influence on the campaign in West Germany. If there was no significant nuclear exchange in Central Europe, a Soviet capture of the heavily industrialized Po Valley would potentially compel the Italians to sue for peace, as well as serve as a gateway to Southern France. Each hex is equivalent to about 10 miles (16 kilometers) from side to opposite side, and each turn represents about a day.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 228 counters (plus 46 bonus counters for Red Tide West)<br/><br/>Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #315<br/><br/>",

It was easy all we had to do was make it simple and quick to play, whilst still blending in a level of complexity that would keep the players interest alive. Well, I am sure that we have succeeded in doing just that. Using a mixture of Metal Miniatures, Resin Buildings and Cards and Counters, there is very little note taking and working out involved as the counters and cards remove this aspect, and the player is free to work on the most important aspect of the game strategy, and this is what the game is really about!<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game all the players start with the same amount of pieces and the basic idea of the game is to grow your settlement faster than the other players, buying Figures and Buildings with game tokens as you go along, hopefully avoiding Natural Disasters and other unforeseen incidents.The game can be played by 2 or 4 players and is for Ages 14 and up and is fun for families as well as boardgamers &amp; wargamers.<br/><br/>A great deal of time and effort was put into the design of the game pieces, which are very detailed. The same figures are used for each different tribe, which are just painted differently. Spears &amp; Shields are cast separately, but come with the figures that they are intended for. The rules are well printed complete with a color cover, and are packed with black &amp; white illustrations. The game tokens are printed in color, on white card.<br/><br/>To sum up, this was daunting but great fum to create, and to play-test, of which there were many games. There isn't a game like it on the market that I know of, and I know that those who buy a set are going to find it an appealing and tactical game. The more you play the game the faster it becomes and the more you will find that you have learned since the last time you played it.&quot;<br/><br/>Currently there are 2 expansions that add Shamans and water taskings:<br/><br/>- &quot;The Savage Seas&quot; <br/>- &quot;Out of the Wilderness&quot;<br/><br/>For more info, check the publisher webpage:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"https://www.stevebarbermodels.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://www.stevebarbermodels.com</a><br/><br/>or the yahoo group: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://groups.yahoo.com/group/steve_barber_models/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/steve_barber_models/</a><br/><br/>",

After Panzer Army Africa (PAA) had defeated the British 8th Army in the Gazala battles, and had captured Tobruk, the newly-promoted German Field Marshal Rommel was intent on destroying the retreating 8th Army and advancing to Cairo. Initially Lt Gen Ritchie intended to mount a stand at Mersa Matruh but he was relieved by his superior General Auchinleck, the Commander in Chief, Middle East, and 8th Army was ordered to break contact with PAA and retire to the El Alamein defensive position. Can PAA stop the 8th Army from conducting an orderly retreat and destroy sufficient units so it can continue its drive to the Nile, or can 8th Army slip away from their pursuers, with minimal losses, so as to be able to regroup at El Alamein and halt the eastward march of the Axis forces?<br/><br/>Units are regiments/brigades with some battalions. Map scale is 4.8 Kms/hex and each of the six turns represents about half a day. Mersa Matruh comes with a full colour 11&quot; x 17&quot; map, 198 mounted color counters, rule book, roster sheets and charts in a ziplock bag.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Push your luck and your opponent by taking part in developing Cleveland's early streetcar lines. Players roll dice to improve their portfolios, expand their railroads, harness new trains or force dividends. Play continues until three of the four railroads have expended their cubes.  The most cash wins.<br/><br/>This game is an approachable, quick train game, similar to a lot of Winsome games.  It uses cubes for track.  It uses shares in a manner similar to Chicago Express.  Payouts and dividend trigger in a manner similar to German Railways.  The unique twist in this game is that there are no treasuries for each company - dice are rolled for any company the player has a share of - and actions are performed on behalf of that company by the player.  Trains are also purchased which work similar to 18XX trains and also add bonuses to the company value as well.  Dice may be rerolled, but 6's are automatically removed and one group of dice for a specific number must always be locked for each roll, like Pickomino.<br/><br/>There are choices to be made along the way - do you invest heavily and buy into shares?  Do you force a swap with your opponent to ruin his position?  Do you build into another railroad now to trigger a dividend or wait until your opponent goes to take it?  Do you take a turn to send your opponent's company into the woods?  How do you manage a poor roll?<br/><br/>This was designed for the 2011 One Sheet PnP Contest.<br/><br/>",

Lovecraft&rsquo;s stories that take place in the world of the Dreamlands.<br/><br/>The Players share this world in their sleep, they probably even know each other here (though they might very well be strangers in the waking world), but they are not enemies. Both of them know many famous people who live in this fantastic land: if only they could convince them to come along to face extraordinary adventures, it would mean a lot of fame to the players themselves.<br/>And fame can go a long way here: the King of Celephais is looking for his successor, and all you need is to prove your worth to follow him on the throne. The player who solves the more Adventures with the most success will win this extraordinary honor, and with that, the game.<br/><br/>During the game, the players will bid on available Friends that can join their company, and they go on randomly assembled Adventures that are made up from 4 different card types. To solve an adventure, a player will need help from his Friends to succeed at various Trials. Despite the randomness, the players have a significant amount of control, and a key to success is to know your limits and to minimize the risks.<br/><br/>Apart from the 200 cards (plus Player Aid and Nightmare track as additional cards), the players are going to need a standard 6 sided die, and about 30 tokens (the game uses only one type of tokens, but possibly you may need quite a lot of that).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once upon a time dodos were living carefree in the realm of Draghan. Especially the little dragons saw the funny birds as cuties, but everything changed when the Dutchmen arrived. With their ships they brought many animals that neither the dragons nor the dodos had set their eyes on before: rats, dogs, pigs... All these creatures hunted the dodos and ransacked their eggs. Unworldly and peaceful in mind, the dodos hadn&rsquo;t been able to stand their ground against these reckless invaders. Can you help the dodos to hatch as many eggs as possible and save them from extinction?<br/><br/>'O Dodo!' is a push your luck game in which you must constantly choose between low risk and high reward. During your turn you alternate in playing a card from your hand and a blind card from the draw pile. You add the cards to one of the nests and the value of the cards you play must go higher and higher. Make the nests as big as you can, so you can hatch as many eggs as possible at the end of your turn. But also know when to stop. When the card you draw from the draw pile is too low or when your hand is empty and you can't hatch the eggs in one of the nests your turn is over and you&rsquo;ll see another player profit of your hard work.<br/><br/>Thanks to the many included variants, the dodos continue to surprise and challenge you even after a long time. A few of the included variants:<br/>- Add ruse cards that will activate a special effect.<br/>- Gather the loot so you can return cards from the discard pile to your hand.<br/>- Add effects to the nests that you can use once during your turn to activate a special effect.<br/>- ...<br/><br/>The game also includes a solo variant and a solo campaign where you have to earn enough points each game to buy a ruse card that you can use from the next game on. The more ruse cards you buy the more chances you have to increase your score. Try to unlock them all and go for the magical score of 100 points to save the dodos from extinction!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>This game is part of the 'World of Draghan'-series.<br/>Part 1: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284585/world-draghan-once-upon-dragon\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/284585/world-draghan-onc...</a><br/>Part 2: <a target='_blank' href=\"https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/285208/world-draghan-sneaky-ol-dragons\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/285208/world-draghan-sne...</a><br/><br/>",

The chosen scenario&nbsp;determines the number of troops you have under your command, as well as your objectives. All you have to do is win!<br/><br/>Fight on a battlefield made up of Terrain Boards containing Terrain Elements that your soldiers must deal with.&nbsp;<br/>On the field, your forces are represented by Unit counters. Each counter has all the information you need to play the Unit: Combat Value, Defense Value, Movement Value, as well as the Special Abilities the Unit can use.<br/><br/>To help you build and organize your army, Heroes of the Pacific offers a system of Recruitment Tiles and Recruitment Options. These tiles allow you to better track your army and its capabilities.<br/><br/>Each Game Turn, you secretly use your Order Tokens to command some of your Units and determine the order in which they will act.<br/><br/>Each of these Units may perform a Movement Action &ndash; to occupy a strategic position or capture an Objective &ndash; or attack the enemy by performing a Firing Action. You and your opponent activate Units one after the other, alternating between them. Once all your Order Tokens are activated, the rest of your forces will have the opportunity to maneuver.&nbsp;<br/>Then you prepare for the next turn.<br/><br/>But Heroes of the Pacific is not just a tactical combat game. It is also a heroic action game. For you will command not only loyal soldiers,<br/>but also brave characters, cunning leaders with talents of their own.&nbsp;<br/><br/>The whims and eccentricities of the gods of war are represented by Action Cards, which can give you that little edge you're missing, or turn the tide of battle completely with a well-planned strategy.<br/><br/>In the end, the commander who best leads his troops in accomplishing his objectives wins. So read on, soldier, and prepare for the test of war.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Get 5 in a row and you immediately lose the game!<br/><br/>Yonmoque applies the 'swapping mechanism' from Othello; opponent pieces that are trapped in between two of your own pieces are turned over so that they become your own. The differences with Othello are that you don't just place tiles on the board, you also move them around. Furthermore, placement and movement is determined by the colour of the squares of the board. There are squares in the colors of each of the players (white and blue), as well as 5 neutral squares. Given that there are less squares for the blue player (8 versus white's 12), the blue player always gets to play the first move.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Operation Typhoon is a solitaire operational-strategic simulation that covers the final advance toward Moscow of Germany&rsquo;s Army Group Center late in 1941. The player actively commands the German forces, while the rules system directs you in the handling of Soviet forces. The system allows the player to plan and execute his advance towards Moscow with the Soviet defending forces being randomly created in each hex dependent on the terrain. You win or lose, ultimately, based on the timely seizure of key areas on the map. Each game turn equals one or two weeks. Each hexagon represents 7.5 miles (12 km) from side to opposite side.<br/><br/>Though designed for solitaire play, Operation Typhoon is easily adaptable to cooperative team play. One person can administratively handle the Soviets while the other actively commands the German force. Alternatively, one player can command the three northern German armies and panzer groups while the other commands the three southern formations. The game map represents the terrain in the operational area of Moscow, with each unit representing the historical German divisions and generic randomly generated Soviet defending forces.<br/><br/>Uses the Panzers East solitaire system.<br/><br/>World at War #65, April-May 2019<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Six new starter decks Animals, Crops, Elementals, Energy, Land and Technology will be available, and players can construct personalized decks of no less than 60 cards, with the cards from any deck.<br/><br/>Ultimate Odyssey is not collectible or random. Players can now buy starter decks and booster expansions for Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey and then use any combination of those cards to form their own constructed decks to play against opponents. Unlike in Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot, where up to eight players play with the same deck of cards, all sharing the same draw pile, Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey has players each draw only from their own constructed deck of 60 cards. There are not any random packs, so players will always know which cards they are purchasing in a deck and they can buy the right products for their planned deck. For Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey six brand new starter decks (red, violet, blue, yellow, green, or orange) allow players to construct a personalized deck with any of the cards of any deck.<br/><br/>The setting for the new game is an ultimate race to build a bunny society on planet Earth. Killer Bunnies and the Ultimate Odyssey pits players against each other as they struggle to gain Civilization Points, by building cities and increasing their bunny populations. Players gain points by developing their own civilizations or by using zany weapons and hilarious scenarios to destroy their opponents.<br/><br/>Heroic and Azoic contains the Elementals, Energy, and Technology starter decks, as well as 3 limited edition promo cards.<br/><br/>",

In the 1 player game you can take command of either one or two ships (depending on difficulty) and follow some of the most dangerous sea journeys of the time.  Enemies such as Dutch, French and Spanish ships will stand in your way, alongside the most famous pirates ever to sail the seas.<br/><br/>The aim is simple! Destroy all of those in the way and make it back still afloat.  Management of HP and ammunition will be key towards the decisions needed to be made on the way.<br/><br/>There are 5 journeys in total in the single player (3 in the two player), and your level of success will depend on the amount of foes you defeat whilst completing those journeys.  On each journey there are 7 positions, at each position you draw a card.  This card is most likely to be one of your enemies to defeat.  Do this by deciding how much ammunition you want to shoot with and rolling for success.  If they aren't sunk already your enemies will fight back! This happens at each position of the journey until you complete the 7th step.  If you are still in one piece then you have been successful.  The game ends when all of the journey are completed and you have made it back alive.  How do you win?  Firstly, a basic win is that you have been able to get through the journeys and made them all home successfully.  On top of that you may be in for recognition, depending on how many foes you have defeated, especially those pirates lurking in your way.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It uses cards to represent the various aeroplane technnologies and random events of the period.<br/><br/>The mechanics are simple: each turn, the players secretly choose two actions to perform: Build (to construct factories), Spy (to acquire other players' technologies, Design (to construct a new type of aeroplane), Research (to get more cards), or Bank (to protect assets from inflation).  Since selection is simultaneous and the actions are quick to resolve there is very little downtime.<br/><br/>After resolving actions, the players are awarded points based on the quality of their aeroplane design and their industrial capacity; then a War Status card is drawn to randomly affect the progress of the war. The game ends when the war does, so timing and efficiently using your actions are important factors in victory.<br/><br/>The game typically lasts about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Wings for the Baron is available from the designer at the game's web site.  Compared to the playtest version, previously distributed for free, this desktop-published game has rules edited for clarity, ten pages of historical notes, more easily distinguished colors, and fully-illustrated cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Empire is a strategic level, traditional hex grid and counter wargame set in a hypothetical ancient era continent.  The game is best with 4 players but can be played with 3 or 2.   Players must manage the economic, diplomatic and military affairs of their faction as they vie for control of the Empire.  Piece density is low &ndash; 117 units.  The game is low to moderate complexity by traditional wargame standards.<br/><br/>The map contains 15 (fictional) provinces of varying sizes and terrain.  There is a large ocean area.  Each Province produces Tribute (in gold coins) for the player who controls it, the amount depending upon the number and size of cities in the Province.  Tribute is spent on building units, supplying units in the field, diplomatic initiatives, building fortifications, hiring mercenaries, and bribing other players.<br/><br/>Military units are Light and Heavy Cavalry, Light and Heavy Infantry, Imperial Guards Infantry, Warships and Siege Engines.  No province can produce all of these and some can only produce 1 or 2.  Units attain Veteran status after engaging in battle, which increases their effectiveness.  Mercenaries can be hired from neutral provinces but cost more to supply than regular units.  Naval battles and amphibious operations are possible (and may be necessary, as one Province is an island).<br/><br/>Units use an innovative combination of area movement (in friendly territory) and hex-by-hex movement (elsewhere).  Cavalry moves first and, uniquely, exerts a Zone of Control.<br/><br/>Each Province may, at any given point, be neutral or controlled by a player.  Control may be obtained by military means (by occupying all of the province&rsquo;s cities) or political.  A wide variety of events trigger an &ldquo;Influence Check&rdquo;, which can result in a change of Political Control.  The Political Control system is really the heart of the game.<br/><br/>The turn sequence consists of interlocking phases: each &ldquo;year&rdquo; contains an annual phase for collecting tribute and resolving control changes, 4 seasonal turns for building and supplying units and conducting diplomacy (etc.), and 12 campaign turns for military operations (campaigning in winter is more costly).<br/><br/>The map is printed on glossy paper; the counters are on thick cardboard but need to be cut out.<br/><br/>Overall, Empire presents some innovative game mechanics which complement its theme well.  Fans of ancient era wargames or games with a strong diplomatic element should take a look.<br/><br/>",

The blurb below doesn't mention it, but the pieces are wooden.<br/><br/>---begin quote from publisher's flyer---<br/>SCOOZIE is a game created to simulate football running and passing plays.<br/><br/>The Offensive team has one runner (ball carrier), two receivers, and 8 guards.  This team also has the ball!  The Defense has eleven tackles.  Points are scored by advancing the Offensive ball carrier on the playing field.<br/><br/>The game board is a classically beautiful, strikingly original grid pattern with intricate route ways for the ball carrier to travel, and a system of circles with &quot;diamond spaces&quot; that let guards and tackles cut across the field.  The sculptured playing pieces can grapple each other in strategically located blocking positions.  The ball carrier can pass the ball to any eligible receiver.  A terrific game for pure strategy lovers, and a splendid simulation for football bluffs!<br/><br/>Elegant hand finished 16x16&quot; wood board with superbly silk screened playing field adds a visual pleasure to the challenge and fascination of the game-play itself.  In leather-like gift box with felt pouch for pieces.  Thoroughly detailed and illustrated rule book.<br/>---end quote from publisher's flyer ---<br/><br/>",

This board shows graphically the focus of a player at any particular time.

Similarly, players have also had access to official characters (meaning not characters created by fans) who are aligned with the forces of Chaos, in the case of the Chaos Warrior, or are at the very least unlikely to be seen as do-gooders, such as in the case of the Ogre.<br/>If the players are so inclined they may forgo their usual characters with which they are accustomed, and take up a life of adventuring as a band of Chaos Dwarfs!&quot;<br/><br/>The expansion rule book contains all the material necessary for players to adventure in the Warhammer world as Chaos Dwarfs (Dawi Zharr), working diligently to establish the city Zharr Grungron Ankor as the next great Dawi Zharr city.<br/><br/>",

There are optional and period specific rules as well as detailed weapon statistics, command ratings and army organisation.<br/><br/>Almost 1000 leader ratings for both sides of the conflict and army lists that are broken down by theatre and year allow players to design their own scenarios, create balanced forces for pick up games or calculate troop quality and strength for historical battles.<br/><br/>This supplement adds a further level of detail to the command and control aspect of Rank &amp; File with a comprehensive order system that takes account of leader ratings, orders issued, distances and staff quality. Optional army morale rules allow large or small games to be played to a definite conclusion within an evening. This allows players to game larger conflicts with all of the problems and uncertainty of command that was a factor in so many ACW battles.<br/><br/>While much of the material included is of use with any rules system a copy of the Rank &amp; File rules are required to gain the most from this supplement.<br/><br/>48page full colour perfect bound A4<br/><br/>",

To gain power players must commit cards sufficient to outpoll the opposition and solve crises, but must avoid overcommitment that reduces future options and opportunities. In addition, each candidate has a different special ability which must be reckoned with.<br/><br/>At the end of play the player with the most prestige points wins.<br/><br/>",

One player takes on the role of the leader of the counter-attacking French 4th DCR forces, the other the commander of those defending the German bridgehead.<br/><br/>After breaking out of the Ardennes Forest and fighting over the Meuse River at Dinant and Sedan, German mechanized forces raced across France to the Channel, effectively splitting the Allies in two. By the end of May the English announced their intention to withdraw the BEF (British Expeditionary Force) at Dunkirk.  Increasingly desperate, the French high command cobbled together a counter-attack force centered on the newly-formed 4th DCR (Division Char de Reserve), led by General Charles DeGaulle, to retake the channel port of Abbeville.  Victory here against the strung out 57th Bavarian Infantry Division could reunify the Allied forces, and also cut-off the deadly but depleted panzer divisions that had earlier wrought so much havoc.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 40 minutes<br/>Hex: 0.25 miles / 0.40 kilometer<br/>Units: Company<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 11x17&quot; full color maps<br/>One single-side printed un-mounted countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)(mounted counters are optional)<br/>One 8-page rulebook<br/>One Player Aid Chart<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1.5 to 2 hours<br/><br/>",

With wise and smart decisions you need to help them to achieve their goals and at the same time impede on other players as much as you can. Each citizen has unique capabilities supporting their admission but your decisions and tactics can make them succeed in this entertaining card game.<br/><br/>Setup: At the beginning sort all the cards by color. Each players chooses a certain color. The optional characters (negative numbers) can be used or can be excluded from the deck at your will. For the first few playthroughs, until you get familiar with the characters and game mechanics, it&rsquo;s best to play without the optional characters. Each player shuffles all of their cards, deal out 4 cards for their hands and placing the rest face down in front of them. Place the Entrance card on the table and in clockwise order the players begin to put their cards one-by-one next to the Entrance card.<br/> Gameplay: (each step is mandatory)<br/><br/>    Place a card<br/>    Execute the action for character of the placed card<br/>    Execute starred characters&rsquo; actions in the queue from back to front. In every turn each character executes their action once, hence if a starred card is placed during the turn then its action won&rsquo;t be executed again.<br/>    Draw a card if you have less than 4 cards in hand.<br/>    If there are at least 5 cards in the queue then the first 2 cards enters the Saloon. At the end of the game (even if Thief is in the queue) when all of the cards are played out the first card of the last queue enters the Saloon and the others go to the Cemetery. Cards are collected facing down.<br/>    If the color of the last card of the queue doesn&rsquo;t match the color of one of the cards which enters the Saloon then the last card walks sadly to the Cemetery. Optional rule: The player whose character walked to the cemetery is allowed (but not compulsorily) to draw one card from one of their opponent&rsquo;s hand if this opponent holds at least 4 cards in their hand. The player puts the drawn card facing up in front of the opponent. The opponent must play out this drawn card in their next turn. Card can not be drawn from opponent who already has a drawn card in front of them.<br/><br/><br/>Ending: Game ends when all of the cards are played out.

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>In 1907, the Imperial Chinese Navy proposed a new building program to provide three regional fleets, each built around a new modern battleship. Two years later a naval commission headed by the Regent's brother, Prince Tsai-hsun, recommended a fleet of eight dreadnoughts and 20 cruisers plus supporting vessels, and began soliciting bids from shipyards around the world.<br/><br/>China never built that fleet, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop you from leading it into battle against the Japanese imperialists. Great War at Sea: Rise of the Dragon presents the Chinese line of battle as proposed by Prince Tsai-hsun, made up of ships built in Germany, Britain, Japan, Austria-Hungary, Italy and the United States.<br/><br/>The Chinese have nine dreadnought battleships: the eight new ships proposed by the Prince, plus the former Brazilian Rio de Janeiro. Plus the twenty proposed cruisers, and the destroyers, mine craft, gunboats and torpedo boats that made up the rest of the program.<br/><br/>Eleven new scenarios send this fleet into action against the Japanese in 1915, resisting Japan&rsquo;s odious demands for control of Chinese ports, railways and mines. The Japanese have countered the Chinese buildup with additional new ships of their own, foregoing the reconstruction of captured Russian prizes to invest instead in additional new battleships and cruisers, including the small battle cruisers proposed in 1905.<br/><br/>Rise of the Dragon is a supplement for the Great War at Sea series, based on battles that never happened. It is not a complete game: Ownership of Russo-Japanese War, Pacific Crossroads and Central Powers (and only those three items) is necessary to play all of the eleven scenarios included.<br/><br/>Rise of the Dragon includes 90 laser-cut and mounted playing pieces: 50 &quot;long&quot; pieces representing major warships and 40 square ones representing smaller craft and fleet markers.<br/><br/>",

One location card is always in play and changes throughout the course of the game; location cards modify the rules of the game.<br/><br/>Action cards (Insults) are used during battle to enhance the strength and wit value of the character as well as insert some trickery to mix!

The pie rule applies (that is, once the first stone is played, the second player can opt to switch colors with his/her opponent).<br/><br/>A group of same-color stones has a value equal to the number of sides it touches. (Note that a stone in the cell where two sides meet touches both of those sides). At the end of the game, each player identifies his/her highest-valued group. The player whose highest-valued group is highest is the winner. In case of tie, the players should ignore the tied groups and compare their remaining groups; the highest value among the remaining groups wins. This process is repeated until the tie is broken.

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Team Yankee is a tabletop miniatures wargame that is set in a fictional World War III in 1985 based on the novel of the same name by Harold Coyle.<br/><br/>The game is a standard two player miniature wargame with each player taking command of a company or battalion level force consisting of hand painted miniatures. The game provides one 6 different missions for the purpose of pickup games. There are also several scenarios in the book that allow the players to recreate some of the battles from the Team Yankee novel.<br/><br/>The game has an accompanying line of 15mm scale miniatures to use but it can be played with models from any manufacture.<br/><br/>Red Thunder introduces new Soviet vehicles. First and foremost is the T-64 tank. The T-64 is a more sophisticated tank than the T-72. It comes with its own optional anti-tank guided missile that is fired through its 125mm 2A46 smooth-bore gun.<br/><br/>Red Thunder also introduces the BTR-60 mounted Motor Rifle Battalion and Companies. The BTR-60 is an 8-wheeled armoured personnel carrier mounting 14.5mm and 7.62mm machine-guns in its small turret.<br/><br/>Red Thunder is also packed full of other stuff. There are three Scenarios that can either be played as one off games or as part of a three game campaign. The book also covers the exploits of the 2nd Guards Tank Army, 94th Guards Motor Rifle Division and Major Yuri Volkov&rsquo;s Tank Battalion during World War III, plus lots of other background and technical information.<br/><br/>",

The players now have to clean up the mess and create new words.<br/>Three theme cards are placed on the table, each player gets a certain amount of letters. Three letters are in the exchange area. The first player places a letter next to a theme card to start a word which fits that theme. The next player can start a new word for a different theme, or continue the current word by dding another letter. At the end of the turn, a player draws a new card.<br/>Instead of playing a hand card, a player may take a letter from the exchange area and add it to any of the words, and must replace it from their hand. If this also doesn't work, they can discard a card. <br/>When a word is finished, the cards (which show a number of points depending on how often they appear in German) are put on a score pile and a new word for this theme can be started. If the players agree that it will be too hard to finish a word, they can discard the cards and start a new word.<br/>Play continues like this until all cards have been played. Points in the discard pile are deducted from the points in the score pile, and the overall number is checked on a chart to see how well the group did.<br/><br/>",

The numbers will correspond to animal cards dealt on the board. The players will then have 60 seconds (or less) to mash up the 3 animals into 1. After the timer is up, players exchange drawings and try to guess which numbers the other player has based on the drawing. Landing on an &quot;X&quot; on the board will draw a sketchy card which changes how the other players must draw.

On your turn, you either draft from the bag, which represents intergalactic condensing matter, or select one of the nebulae and absorb it in your forming galaxy.

This will make it easier for you to build the right building pieces, but you will not be able to use those builders to build on temple grounds.<br/>A part of the game play is based on that other famous tower, the Hanoi tower. This means you can not build or move a large boulder on top of a smaller one.<br/><br/>A player's turn consists of:<br/><br/>     The (re)placing of the builder(s) on temple grounds and in the building school.<br/>     Rolling the building dice or moving a building piece.<br/>     If the player has builders on the beginner's places in the building school: draw action cards.<br/><br/><br/>Play continues until all the action cards have been used or until the Central Temple has been completed. Then, points are counted.<br/><br/>The higher the temple, the more points you get. Empty or hardly built-up temple grounds with only one building piece give you penalty points. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>The game is a mixture of strategy, luck and tactics. <br/>A lot of choices have to be made: Choose whether to train your workers, or let them build temples. Choose whether to build higher temples or more. Decide whether moving a boulder is a better choice than building one...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spectators watch in awe as robots armed with laser cannons blast each other in vast arenas. Tactics and destruction rule, and only the best survive.<br/><br/>Laser Bots is a pocket sized game that comes in a mint tin. Players each control a robot via an innovative action management system: actions become more powerful depending on the amount of cards you have played.<br/><br/>There are four different robots, each with its own unique robot board and program cards. The program cards form part of your hand and are used to perform actions. Each turn players place their cards in their 'program row'; many actions become more powerful the more cards you have in your program row, so the order you play your cards can be the the key to victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Nine Lives is a Rogue-Like Roll-and-Write Game<br/><br/>You are a Cat trying to explore a Dungeon. You only have Nine Lives to explore the Dungeon. Find treasure, upgrade your Cat, and explore the dungeon in order to earn the most points.<br/><br/>Players: 1 - 100+<br/>Game Time: 20 minutes<br/>Items needed: 6 six-sided dice, one of them being a different color than the other five and one &ldquo;Nine Lives&rdquo; sheet per player<br/><br/>Setup: Roll 2 d6 to determine the End Goals for the game, mark the End Goals with an X over the die symbol. (Re-roll if necessary until there are two different numbers)<br/>All players will use the same Dungeon Map layout and End Goals. The game is played simultaneously, with players trying to earn the most points. All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, assigning however each player determines.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>Determine Starting Point - Roll 2 d6 that are different colors. Use the darker die for determining the columns and the lighter die for determining the rows. Find coordinating locations on the Dungeon Map. Choose one and mark an X on the Dungeon Map to show your starting point for this life. If a 6 is rolled on the die, it is a wild for that row or column, and you may choose any location while still following the other die rolled. If both dice are 6&rsquo;s, you can start at any location on the map. Each player chooses their own starting point following these rules.<br/><br/>Choose a Cat - Choose a Cat by marking the number of this life in the corner for this run in the dungeon. For the first turn, use the Starter Cat. Following turns, you may choose any cat that has not yet been chosen. In a multiplayer game, each player can choose any Cat they would like for each life.<br/><br/>Roll 5 Dice - Roll 5 d6 for this Cat&rsquo;s life in the dungeon.<br/><br/>Assign Dice - For each die, choose to either Upgrade a skill or Move the direction of the dice in the dungeon. Players simultaneously use the 5 dice rolled to move and/or upgrade.<br/><br/>Repeat these steps for each life of your Cat.<br/><br/>How Movement Works:<br/>- Orthogonally (Up, Down, Right, Left; North, South, East, West) <br/>- When you enter a new square/room, mark an X on it.<br/>- Your next movement must always follow from the last X you marked this life. <br/>- The die numbers correspond to the direction you may move; 1=North, 2=East, 3=South, 4=West, 5=North OR South, 6=East OR West<br/>- You may only move into a square/room without an X. You may never retrace your steps or go onto a space that you have previously X&rsquo;ed. <br/>- If you enter a square/room with an icon that you have upgraded to, you earn a treasure. Mark an X over one of the Treasure. Each Treasure is worth 2 Victory Points.<br/>- You may X squares/rooms that have icons you have not unlocked yet, you just will not earn that Treasure this game.<br/>- There are &ldquo;Upgrade Arrows&rdquo; throughout the map.   If you ever enter one of these spaces, you immediately mark the next X on any one Upgrade track<br/><br/>How Upgrading Works:<br/>- There are four skill tracks to advance to upgrade your Cat throughout the game.<br/>- Upgrade from left to right, marking an X in the leftmost empty square corresponding to the die.<br/>- Once a square with an icon in it is X&rsquo;ed, you now have that skill. When entering spaces in the Dungeon Map with that icon, you now earn Treasure.<br/>- Once a skill track has been upgraded 9 times, you unlock a unique ability to use once during each Cat&rsquo;s life. <br/>- Upgrades remain for the entire game.<br/><br/>End of Game: After you have used your last Cat (9 lives), the game is over. Total your score. Each Treasure earned is worth 2 Victory Points. Earn corresponding Victory Points for each Upgrade unlocked (On each skill track, first unlock is 1 VP, second unlock is an additional 2 VP, third unlock is an additional 3 VP). Total your Victory Points for the two End Goals that were rolled during Setup. The player with the most Victory Points is the winner!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Kings of the whole Europe joyfully welcome Aliens, and Ð¡hurch declares them as envoys from the Paradise.<br/>But there is one tiny trouble - marvelous creatures do not speak Latin! They do not understand either Arabic or Greek. However, they strongly want Brave Knights and Fair Maidens to travel with them to the stars.<br/><br/>Players are divided into medieval humans and aliens, who came with a friendly visit. Now they have to find a common language and decide which alien ships will go to the stars with humans onboard.<br/><br/>Players take turns: first one of humans, then one of the aliens, then again one of the earthlings, etc.<br/>Humans use cards with medieval objects that are on the table or with already played cards from their hands and try to identify which symbols can aliens use to name objects. <br/>Then one of the Aliens invites humans on the ship he has chosen for departure in this round by using symbolic description. The rest of Aliens are betting - where else can humans go by mistake.<br/><br/>The game continues until humans send all their representatives into space. The winner among Aliens is the one who have collected the highest amount of humans on their ships. The winner among humans is the one who sent more people into space and revealed most of the words from alien language, which are defined by his card of secret goal.<br/><br/>We tried to pay attention to all questions and suggestions from players in First Contact original game. So this time we made gameplay more diverse and deep, managed to solve the problem of active involvement of all players in each round, and in the end our game is more competitive now.<br/><br/>First contact: The Second Coming is compatible with the original game and you can still play this version with original rules.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Time Machine Rocket is a fast, simple and fun card game. It has a great balance between strategy and luck, in addition to the possibility of interfering in the opponents' game.<br/><br/>The theme is inspired by time travel narratives that promote the unexpected encounter of figures from different eras. In short, the idea is to travel in time in search of forming the best team of historical personalities, bringing together figures such as Leonardo da Vinci and Bruce Lee.<br/><br/>In each turn, the player opens a card from the historic decks. She then decides whether to bring that character to her team, or to open a new card. If she opens a Rocket, she advances to the next deck. If she opens a character of the same type that she opened before, she now have to put that character on her team.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player forms a team of 5 characters, of 5 different types (Humanitarian, Military, Creative, Scientist and Explorer). The player sums up the numbers of each character, and the one with most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Investiture is modeled after various stock markets around the world, enabling you to understand how transactions work and all the while grow rich. It combines the intensity of the stock market with the strategy to become rich and have fun! This game requires no prior knowledge of how stock markets work! Be careful, because your decisions will affect every other player in the market!<br/><br/>On a turn a player may buy a stock, short a stock, or sell a stock they currently own. They may also play one of the lucky break cards in their hand. They get 3 turns per round and after each player has taken 3 turns, one at a time, all the cards are thrown in the middle to reflect the price changes of the stock.<br/><br/>The game is won when the players have decided to end the game. We typically suggest 10 rounds for full gameplay. The player who has the highest value in terms of cash in hand and stock market value on the board is declared the winner!<br/><br/>",

A Goodie has gone bad and it's up to you to swap, steal or search for the evidence, seek out the suspects and catch the culprit in order to scupper the other sleuths, and win this game of murder! Let's just hope your case doesn't go cold before revealing your solution (dramatically, of course) and catching the culprit! Case closed!<br/><br/>There&rsquo;s more than one way to catch a killer though.  So what&rsquo;s it gonna be? Good Cop or Bad Cop? If you&rsquo;re playing Good Cop you&rsquo;re chasing down a specific killer, whereas Bad Cop you'll have to successfully frame any one of the eight suspects in order to win. Each way to play comes with its own set of rules and tactics, but will you use fair play or foul play? There's 8 new suspects but which of these fairy-tale felons committed the crime?<br/><br/>We've kept the same design for the backs of the cards as the 1st edition of the game. This means that you can combine decks, swap the special action cards around and even try and solve two murders at the same time! Want to separate the decks back again when you've finished? Don't panic - the font used for the titles on each action card is different to the original, helping you to tell which card belongs to what game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spirit Fire is a non-linear, open-world board game system in which you explore compelling fantasy realms on an introspective journey of discovery, wonder, and mystery. Your choices matter, because instead of following a story, you ARE the story.<br/><br/>This is a substantive, emotionally-driven experience with aspirations beyond the expected iterations on tactical combat and standard gameplay. To emphasize this vision, there is no combat. Instead, this experience finds conflict, pressure, and suspense in the countless other types of difficult challenges life asks us to overcome, including the tensions we face deep within ourselves. In the world of Spirit Fire, wisdom is your only weapon.<br/><br/>The game&rsquo;s system has two principal pieces: your character box, and realm boxes. With the first, you create your character, with whom you explore the open-world realm boxes. Across the realms, you tell your story in a campaign of your own creation, exploring where you want, pursuing the quests and ideals of your choosing, in an experience some have compared to an MMORPG (like World of Warcraft), but most agree defies easy classification.<br/><br/>Spirit Fire seeks to provide the greatest single player experience available, inspired by a love of TCGs, MMOs, rogue-lite-like loops, metroidvania map development and discovery, fantasy fiction, and&mdash;more than anything&mdash;a desire for something truly new and fresh.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll explore a series of open-world maps, uncovering new locations and quests in worlds that evolve based on your discoveries and actions. As your character grows, you will craft your deck and bring it to bear against countless unique challenges in the game&rsquo;s spiral bound book. Each quest or encounter card introduces variables that create a unique variation of one of the book&rsquo;s dozens (and dozens) of challenge spreads, which vary wildly in style and function depending on the type of activity you are engaged in. Each challenge or activity you&rsquo;re attempting (evading a threat, deciphering a lost language, negotiating with telepathic wolves, and so forth) recontextualizes your card play, giving you a constant stream of fresh opportunities for creative response without requiring you to learn a bunch of new mechanics all the time.<br/><br/>With drop-in / drop-out multiplayer (meaning seamless transitions between solo and cooperative play, if you&rsquo;re a &ldquo;never solo alone&rdquo;-er), multiple open-world realms coming at launch (with many more in development), and a plan for a continuous stream of quest packs that can by played in any realm, Spirit Fire is a deeply customizable, on-going experience from the award-winning creators of Vindication and Unsettled.<br/><br/>What will you do, in this dark world, with the flame you carry?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Take enough down and you can bring the battle to Mainland Japan and win the war.<br/><br/>Using the Gear Card System, you control your three flights of Hellcats and CVL-24 to shoot down Zeroes and bomb island bases. During that time, you must protect your carrier from Judy&rsquo;s (Japanese Bombers) and Kamikaze pilots. If your carrier is sunk, it is game over.<br/><br/>You must maintain the right altitude to fire down the Zeroes and high-altitude bombers, while evading their attacks. Dive bombing enemy bases is also no easy task. Flak can bring you down in an instant. All the while, you must keep an eye on your fuel and the threatening sky.<br/><br/>Become an Ace by shooting down Zeroes and earn powerful Upgrades.<br/><br/>Make it through the day and lead the US Navy to victory in the Pacific!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

With each die, they may either place a new chip on that location in their home row, or move a stack from their home row if they already have a stack in that space. Movement is similar to games like Backgammon, Kalah (Mancala), Veritas, or Tak: a stack of chips is dropped one piece at a time, covering other stacks as it goes.<br/><br/>When either player runs out of options, the other player gets just one more turn, and then the winner is the player who captures the most points in the center.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>",

By consolidating the separatist entities of South Ossetia and Abkhazia, Georgia would face a dilemma: recognize the independence of the two breakaway regions and try to join NATO or remain a &ldquo;frozen conflict&rdquo; and therefore unable to join NATO or the European Union in the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents one day.

In next few years you have to sink as many ships as you can, scoring enough tonnage to win the game.<br/><br/>Components:<br/>54 cards with variable usage. Cards are split into: Air Attacks, Ships and Escorts. Ships can come into three different sizes with different tonnage as: Small Freighter, Medium Freighter and Large Tanker.<br/>Escorts come into three different types: Green, Trained and Veteran Escort. Escort ships also are marked with a big letter E on the top right edge of a card.<br/><br/>Game objective:<br/>Play 2 patrols per month (each month is split into 15 days period, or two weeks), sink ships and record their tonnage, until the end of December of 1943, if you survive that long. Depending on the tonnage.<br/><br/>you sank you will either achieve total victory, some kind of consolation victory or total defeat. Dying in this game is considered a defeat.<br/><br/>Sequence of Play:<br/>You are doing one patrol per 15 days (half of the month), starting from January of 1941.<br/>Each patrol is consistent of encounters. Number of encounters depends on you, but the type is always random.<br/>Your Patrol starts by drawing one card and using its Encounter value.<br/><br/>&ndash; If its an Air Attack! You will not have an option to react or do any action. Draw one card to see how many depth charges airplane has used to hit you, then draw that much cards for damage. Then, if you are not sunk by that attack, decide to either return to base or have another encounter.<br/>&ndash; If its a Group encounter, first draw a card to establish a time of day and weather (using both icons in a row from that card) and then draw number of random ships to form a group and continue to battle phase. Same thing is done for a Convoy encounter, but you must form a specific group of ships and escorts.<br/>&ndash; Battle phase &ndash; torpedo attack &ndash; may have up to 2 rounds<br/>&ndash; Before starting with a torpedo attack you may use an action called WAIT. If you are not satisfied with a current day of time and weather, you may replace that card with the new one from the top of the deck. You have to keep the new card and you can only perform this action once per battle phase.<br/>&ndash; You may also decide to DISENGAGE and skip the battle phase after you have form a group of ships. But, you can do this only once per Patrol! If you do it again you must return to base immediately, ending a patrol for that month.<br/>&ndash; To attack ships chose your targets and then depending on the weather you my fire up to 6 or up to 8 torpedoes by drawing cards from a deck and placing them face down in a column, under your targeted ships. You may split number of fired torpedoes per target as you wish, you may also decide not to fire a full complement. You my fire at multiple targets of your choice.<br/><br/>Marking your tonnage and time passage You can either use a chart provided with the game or keep a diary in a RPG style of writing. In both cases you must mark that half of a month has passed and write down your tonnage you manage to score from your patrol.<br/><br/>If your submarine had 4 to 5 damage, you must skip half of a month before going to another patrol. If you manage to survive whole three years (1941-1943), summarize all tonnage and consult the chart below to see how did you do.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The deck of 98 cards can be whittled down to a standard 52-card deck to play all the classics, though it contains 6 full standard suits and plenty more, including story suits for storytelling games (with images), 3 colored suits, and 6 minor elemental suits that have no problem sharing their cards with other elemental suits.<br/><br/>The cards are orientation-dependent, so the properties they take on will differ depending on whether they are played right-side-up or upside-down.<br/><br/>In addition to playing some of your favorite card games, you can use the deck to create new games. The different types of suits can be played separately or mixed and matched for tons of unique gameplay possibilities.<br/><br/>Some of the ways the cards can be organized are:<br/><br/>- Six suits (HEARTS, CROSSES, CLOVERS, TOADSTOOLS, DIAMONDS, and HORNS) numbered 0-14. Aces, Jacks, Queens, and Kings are further marked for use in a standard deck.<br/><br/>- Three suits (RED, BLUE, and GREEN) numbered 0-29.<br/><br/>- Two full sets of six suits (EARTH, FIRE, WATER, AIR, MAGIC, and ALCHEMY), numbered 2-9 plus the additional classes ACE, APPRENTICE, MAGICIAN, and WIZARD. These suits come 1, 2, or 3 to a card.<br/><br/>- Five story suits (WILD, ITEM, EVENT, CHARACTER, and LOCATION). Each card in the deck has a different image that can be used in creative and storytelling games.<br/><br/>The deck also contains 8 wild cards that can be organized by color (making 4 groups of 2) or by layout (making 2 groups of 4).<br/><br/>",

Those will be of different types, ranging from orbital to subterranean ones. The different types of colonies will provide different resources, such as materials for self-replication (MAT), energy (NRG) or organic-life support (H2O), and each will adjust better or worst to the parameters of Gravity (G&deg;), Pressure (P&deg;), Radiation (R&deg;) and Temperature (T&deg;) depicted for each location.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, players will be building a network of colonies that will provide these resources to the joint colonization effort (for a price). Players will also be able to contribute in major shared projects, such as the terraforming of Mars. When a certain number of colonies are established the game will end, and the player having the most influence in the now-populated Solar System (acquired by leading the many logistical and technical endeavors) will emerge as the leader of the new Solar Federation.<br/><br/>The game uses a time/cost turn order track similar to &quot;In the Year of the Dragon&quot; or &quot;Thebes&quot;, where players performing a more demanding action will be pushed back farther in the turn order track, while the player in-turn will always be the one ahead in the track.<br/><br/>Another distinctive element of the game is the shared nature of the resources, as every player can use technologies, colonies and their resources output, belonging to other players, to boost their own colonization plan. This is done for a price, as &ldquo;lending&rdquo; these assets advances its controller in the turn track.<br/><br/>The educational aspect of the game comes from the realistic depiction of the different environments in space, the theoretical technological and logistical steps required to settle them, and a number of &ldquo;flavor data&rdquo; notes scattered throughout the game board.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During certain missions, the Sine Tempore heroes will come across various indigenous alien species. In some cases, they will be able to make friends with some of the animals. These may appear to be relatively docile, but with a bit of proper training they can become valuable sidekicks. To receive the pets, the first thing you need to do is make one of the Genesis rooms into a zoo.<br/><br/>Generally speaking, pets give their owners new and exclusive skills. A pet assigned to a hero can never change owner and will be removed from the game when the hero abandons the mission. If a hero dies, his or her pet will leave the Genesis forever. Most crew members can only have one pet. The zoo can be improved to hold multiple pets. In this case, a hero can own multiple animals, although they can only bring one into battle.<br/><br/>Content: 1 Brawler, 1 Krabnock, 1 Gorous, 3 Petc cards.<br/><br/>",

There is one slight problem. The Bowies are endangered by various threats, dark princes, and figures of the occult (which is in no way related to the copious amount of cocaine being inhaled by our hero).

In this game, you'll play as either the Royalists or Parliamentarians, two opposing factions vying for political, economic and religious control of England. The game is based on the classic card game German Whist, but with a few twists &ndash; you'll be able to play with leaders and assets that represent key actors of the first English Civil War. With strategic play and a bit of luck, you can lead your faction to victory and secure your place in history.<br/>Taking place in the mid-17th century, the first English Civil War was a time of great political and social upheaval. The conflict pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of Parliament, who sought to limit the monarch's power and establish a more democratic government. As you play &quot;A Very Civil Whist&quot;, you'll experience the tension and drama of this critical period in English history. Will you be able to rally your troops and secure victory for your faction? Or will you fall to your opponent and be consigned to the dustbin of history?

This map adds quite a few nuances to the base game such as:<br/><br/>a.) Banks were hesitant to invest in the industrial sector so loans return $1 less for each additional loan after the first.<br/><br/>b.) Railway expansion was highly encouraged - certain rails are worth $4 at the end of the game instead of $2 and there are bonus VP for the player who finishes with the most VP.<br/><br/>c.) Government debt was mounting rapidly due to poor management so to simulate this waste, corruption, and poor economy, there is always a region or industry where you CANNOT build.<br/><br/>...and many more!<br/><br/>Players must navigate the map's tightness - don't forget the option to combine both actions to build anywhere! - and suffocating economy to try and build a prosperous network.<br/><br/>",

Rule the battlefield with powerful formations and lead your forces with mighty heroes. Overcome your opponent, destroy his fortress and reap the spoils of war! How will you earn victory?<br/><br/>The players face each other on the battlefield, they create powerful formations and lead their forces to victory with the aid of mighty kings. The game features tokens and dice expanding it beyond the limits of a mere card game, creating an exciting combination of tactics and luck.<br/><br/>Runes of Mayhem is a game where choosing the right units, using the proper abilities and formations are vital, but luck matters too - after all, you cannot wholly control the mayhem of an epic battle. If you play your cards right and lead your units as a true tactician, you can render your opponent unable to roll, eliminating most of the luck factor.<br/><br/>Runes of Mayhem is highly enjoyable from the very first play, and with experience, you will be able to make optimal tactical decisions. Take a defensive or an offensive approach, concentrate building momentum and speed or take your time and trade. Many paths lead to victory, but only if you pay close attention and grasp the pace of the game. In Runes of Mayhem, you decide what road to take!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

That change in Region&rsquo;s value will mean you would need to play your whole game differently!<br/><br/>New Crystals is a very simple mini-expansion that adds a ton of strategy to the game. In the setup phase, players will plant different regions with white and black crystals. Unlike the ones from the base game, these black and white are one use only, sort of objectives to grab, secure and score. And unlike the ones from the base game, white and black crystals are located precisely where you want them to be. You set the scene. You prepare the game. You let other players know which region is vital for you. After the setup phase is over, the board is filled with white and black crystals, markers that manifest players plans. For winning in the region with white crystals, you get additional points. If you win in a region with black ones, the score for this battle will be lower.

The GMs (human players) put together their teams through a fantasy-style draft and attempt to take their teams to the championship.  In addition to basketball players, each GM will choose a coach and use Strategy cards to boost player abilities.  The GMs must also contend with play injuries, suspensions, and other hindrances.<br/><br/>Each game begins with a fantasy draft, either auction style or through a &quot;pick and pass&quot; method, and then the season begins.  Each game turn represents several weeks of a basketball season.  GMs earn victory points based on their teams' total ability from their players, plus a small random factor of 1-3 dice.  The teams with the most victory points at the end compete head to head in a championship game or series.<br/><br/>After the draft, GMs can improve their teams through the course of the season by trading with other GMs or through the trading block.  The trading block is an auction in which GMs make trade offers for players from the player pool.  Because only a fraction of the players in the game will be available for the initial draft, there is still a lot of talent to acquire over the course of the season.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Nanga Parbat: Missions Pack is an expansion pack for Nanga Parbat.  The pack includes a total of 14 cards: 11 game cards (5 mission cards + 6 reward cards) and 3 rules cards.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the 5 mission cards are laid out in a row, showing the different missions for the game.  Paired with each mission is a reward card. The first player to accomplish a mission earns the reward card. Since the mission cards are double-sided, there is a wide variety of mission combinations.  Plus, with 6 different rewards and only 5 used per game, the reward combinations also differ from game to game.<br/><br/>More specifically, each mission shows 3 hikers in a particular pattern in a region.  To accomplish the mission, a player must have their own hikers in the exact combination shown in one of the six regions.<br/><br/>The reward cards include an immediate point reward and/or a special power. The front side of the cards show the rewards using icons, while the backside describe the rewards in text.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each hex represents 200 metres or 218 yards of terrain (Alma 250 metres or 273 yards), each game turn corresponds to 20-30 minutes of real time.<br/><br/>Infantry is represented by battalions and light infantry companies, cavalry by regiments (sometimes divided into two counters), artillery by batteries (classified by weight).<br/><br/>Each game turn is divided into phases:<br/>1)Command phase &ndash; players use their Commanders-in-Chief and dispatch riders to give orders to subordinate commanders.<br/>2)Activation phase &ndash; after determining the initiative, players, using the Activation Markers, choose the division to activate. Activated units, move, fire, commence melee combat and reorganise disorganised units. The opponent can react by firing or counterattacking<br/>3)Reorganisation phase &ndash; players reorganise broken units<br/><br/>The principle of the game is based on an order system, which is associated with target hexes. The player must carry out the assigned order (of course, he gives them to himself), until the order is changed by the Commander-in-Chief, or the division commander manages to change it by himself. The order must be associated with a target hex (i.e attack hex, defend hex). The possible orders are: ATTACK, DEFEND, FORCED MARCH.<br/><br/>The game tries to present the diversity of combatants tactics mainly through unit formations. And so &ndash; Russian infantry can fight in company or closed columns, French infantry in closed columns or lines and the British infantry only in lines. Each side can form squares, and can use skirmishers. The French Eastern Army excels in light infantry tactics due to it&rsquo;s many formations of such units (chasseurs, zouaves, algerian tiraillieurs).<br/><br/>The game treats the concept of  zone of control differently from other games &ndash; it gives up the obligation to stop moving the unit in the enemy ZOC. The ZOC is a phenomenon that allows to fire or initiate close combat, and it is dependent on the units formation and the range of its firearms.<br/><br/>Unit movement doesn&rsquo;t differ from other hex-and-counter systems.<br/><br/>The game discerns fire combat and melee combat. The fire combat takes into consideration the following aspects:<br/>1)firing unit strength<br/>2)firing unit formation (skirmishers)<br/>3)target formation<br/>4)distance to target<br/><br/>Fire combat is initiated at the cost of movement points in the unit&rsquo;s activation phase, and once as a reaction for the enemy&rsquo;s doings. Fire combat is based on the unit&rsquo;s morale modifier, which is a combination of unit&rsquo;s morale, training and other &ldquo;psychological&rdquo; factors. Fire combat effects in loss of  endurance, disorganisation and in critical cases, breaking of the attacked unit. Losing movement point is also the effect of fire combat.<br/><br/>Artillery fire combat is constructed similarly to infantry fire combat &ndash; it only takes into account the differences in range and firepower of guns.<br/><br/>As a rule, to initiate melee combat, the unit must fight in a compact formation (column, line) or be a cavalry unit. Starting combat requires for a attacking unit to posses sufficient movement points after moving (a marker is placed, on the unit that meets that condition). Melee combat is also based on the unit&rsquo;s morale, strength, formation, also the terrain and attacks from the flank or the unit&rsquo;s rear. Effects of melee combat are disorganisation (also of the attacking unit) or breakdown and taking flight. Cavalry combat also includes the unit&rsquo;s momentum &ndash; which is taken from the type of the unit (heavy, lancers, light cavalry). Cavalry may react by counter-charging.<br/><br/>The loss of unit&rsquo;s endurance during the game is marked on special tables. The use of tables intents to show precisely the diverse levels of combat losses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As a continuation of the Leningrad&ndash;Novgorod Offensive of January 1944, the Soviet Estonian operation pushed the front westward to the Narva River, aiming to thrust deep into Estonia. Stalin's main strategic goal was a quick recovery of<br/>Estonia as a base for air and seaborne attacks against Finland and an invasion of East Prussia.<br/><br/>The German answer was a stout defence for the possession of the strategically important Narva Isthmus.<br/>Army Group Narwa&trade; is a board game depicting this event in time.&hellip;.<br/><br/>The Soviet units established a number of bridgeheads on the opposite bank of the river in February. Subsequent attempts failed to expand their toehold. German counter attacks annihilated the bridgeheads to the north of Narva and reduced the bridgehead south of the town, stabilizing the front until July 1944.<br/><br/>Army Group Narwa&trade; covers the first three months of the Narva Bridgehead campaign where each turn represents one week.<br/>Army Group Narwa&trade; is taught in 30 minutes and easy to digest yet a challenge even for the more experienced players. It is built around the same system of rules that shaped Plan West, KÃ¶nigsberg '45 and Stargard Solstice.<br/><br/>The game utilizes a chit-pull system telling you which armies to move.<br/><br/>Game components:<br/>- Book-case box<br/>- 70 x 50 cm map (28 x 20 in)<br/>- 300 die-cut counters<br/>- Game rules<br/>- 2 dice<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&bull; Set in the not-so-distant future, humanity has been able to colonize the planets in our solar system, but the technology to travel beyond the stars has eluded us. Scientists have discovered that Earth has only 6 years left before it becomes uninhabitable, and there is nothing that can be done to save our planet. You are a captain of a space ship that has been summoned to Earth to help start with the evacuation of the planet. You are not the only captain on the horizon looking to make some quick fame escorting earthlings to the other planets. You will have to trade with the planets in order to upgrade your ship so you can fight off each other as well as the Plutonian Space Pirate threat.<br/><br/>&bull; The object of &quot;8 Planets: Captains of the Solar System&quot; is to earn victory points by rescuing the people of Earth and delivering them to the other planets in our solar system. Each player has their own spaceship on which he may carry both Earthlings and cargo. Cargo is moved from one planet to another and the further the cargo travels, the more credits will be earned for delivering the cargo to the other planets. Players have the ability to upgrade their engines, expand their cargo space, and obtain more powerful weapons by using credits earned. Powerful engines allow players to travel a greater distance between planets, and they also affect turn order. Your cargo hold is small at first, but when you upgrade, you can hold greater amounts of cargo and refugees. Weapon strength helps you to defeat the Plutonian Space Pirates, who hide in the Main Asteroid Belt and Kuiper Belt. Strong weapons also help players defeat each other when they are engaged in player versus player combat.<br/><br/>&bull; Players earn victory points both by delivering people to other planets and by defeating other players in player versus player combat. Players who are brave enough to travel to the Main Asteroid Belt or Kuiper Belt may earn additional victory points by defeating the Plutonian Space Pirates.<br/><br/>&bull; When play begins, Earth has six years left before it will become uninhabitable. There are four rounds (seasons) of play in each year, preceded by the action of revealing one event card. Event cards affect each year of play by changing certain elements of the game. For example, an Galactic Event card may ban player versus player combat on any given planet for one year, or may cause cargo deliveries to be worth less or more than usual.<br/><br/>&bull; Will you take the role of a reputable space trader, a sinister space pirate, or even a famous humanitarian who lives to save millions of lives? Earth needs your help!<br/><br/>",

Destroying opponent parts earns you victory<br/>points and the first to gain 10 points wins. A core will get you all 10 points, but it's hard to hit. This is because one of the actions players can perform in a turn is to use an arm to defend, forcing an attack to target it instead of anything else (until it is hit).<br/><br/>Since you are only able to take 3 actions per turn, managing your offense and defense is key to survival. And with a weapon triangle causing weaknesses and resistances along with tons of unique special abilities for each part, you'll need to install parts strategically to get the upper hand.<br/><br/>With designs taking inspiration from Mecha anime and video games, Wreck&shy;-A-&shy;Mecha let&rsquo;s you live out your Mecha customization fantasies in a quick 15&shy;-30 minute game.

All of the Central Powers &ndash; even the Bulgarians &ndash; made claims on at least some of the ships of the Black Sea Fleet as war reparations, as did the newly-independent Ukraine. The German Navy intended to man the best ships with Turkish crews backed by German &quot;advisors&quot; and send them to protect the Dardanelles. Only one ship, the dreadnought Volya, would ever sail under a Central Powers flag (on a single test cruise with a German crew), but the Allies fretted over the appearance of the former Russian ships outside the Turkish Straits.<br/><br/>The New Year's 2014 Golden Journal includes 25 new laser-cut, mounted, scorchless and sootless pieces for the Turkish Black Sea Fleet: 15 &quot;long&quot; ship pieces, 9 square ones, and a seaplane. And we have some scenarios for them, too.<br/><br/>",

Using your covered card you can also kick, try a drop, play a penalty. The game focuses on the mainstream of a match: you have to choose if you want to try a fast advance taking some risks or kick to push your adversary to a respectable distance from your goal line.<br/>The deck of 48 cards allows you to create teams of 5 different level. An entire 6 Nations can be played, by 6 players, in no more  than 2 hours.<br/>The game has been designed by a rugby player and tested on the field, drinking beer during hard Half Times.<br/><br/>",

The gods themselves are depicted crowned with a naja.<br/><br/>The scarab rolls the sun around to rise each day, and thus ensures renewal and prosperity. As royalty, veritable deities, you send your najas to lay claim to scarabs, ensuring new life for your lineage.<br/><br/>In the game Naja, players take turns placing cobras on the board trying to surround as many scarabs as possible. But try not to claim bonfires, lest they harm your najas and weaken your reign!<br/><br/>EQUIPMENT<br/><br/>This is what you need to play Naja:<br/><br/><br/>     9x9 board with a scarab on each cell<br/>     20 white najas (snakes)<br/>     20 black najas (snakes)<br/>     7 bonfires<br/>     40 black baskets<br/>     40 white baskets<br/><br/><br/>You can also get the expansion for 3&ndash;4 players:<br/><br/><br/>     15 gray najas<br/>     15 purple najas<br/>     30 gray baskets<br/>     30 purple baskets<br/><br/><br/>SETUP<br/><br/>Place the board in the middle of the playing surface. Each player takes all najas and counters of her colour.<br/><br/>Randomly place 5 or 7 bonfires (not 6) on different spaces of the board, except for the middle space (to avoid symmetric play) and the border spaces (where they pose almost no risk).<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY<br/><br/>White starts. Players take turns in clockwise order legally placing a naja of their colour until no legal placement remains, at which point the game ends.<br/><br/>Najas have 4 segments. Each naja must be placed so that:<br/><br/><br/>     All four segments lie on 4 segments of the board.<br/>     They don&rsquo;t overlap.<br/><br/><br/>GAME END<br/><br/>The game ends when no more placements are possible.<br/><br/>Players then claim areas as follows: The player with more naja segments surrounding an enclosed area must claim it by placing a basket of her colour on each space in the area (except for areas with bonfires on them). If two (or more) players tie in claiming an area, it remains unclaimed. The edge of the board is not a wall, so some areas around the edge might remain unclaimed.<br/><br/>Each claimed scarab is worth +1 point, but each claimed bonfire is worth &minus;3 points (najas don&rsquo;t like fire!). Ties are possible and are OK: Just play again!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Expect Delays is a 10-20 min deck de-builder for 2 or 4 players all about the joys of riding public transit. Players take on the role of busy commuters desperately trying to get to work via an underfunded and barely operating subway system.<br/><br/>Players share access to a deck of trains they use to move commuters along their train lines. On their turn players may board riders, run lines, repair trains, or take trains out of service by removing them from the shared deck. Players must utilize this tug-of-war style deck building to make sure their commuters can progress further then those on the opponents line. The player with the most destination points when the deck runs out of cards and the subway comes to a grinding halt, wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Take a thrilling ride through Sacramentos most beautiful and iconic locations, while collaborating to connect them together and with the game.<br/><br/>- A great filler or gateway game that will hit the table often.<br/>- The game can be taught in a few minutes and is highly thematic and accessible.<br/>- Bike route is a light route building game that is semi-cooperative but includes optional rules for more complexity.<br/>- The game has a great climax where eveybody fells like they are 'one turn away from winning.<br/><br/>In the game players build bike routes around the city winning community rewards. The first player to 7 points wins.<br/><br/>The game includes exquisite paintings of local landmarks and locations both past, present and future. This is not the Sacramento of today but a Sacramento of the imagination, with ideas that excite the spirit, from the historical past to the hopeful future. Bike Route includes everything from the majestic Alhambra movie palace to the soon to be completed Powerhouse Science Center on the river. All the wonderful things that you think about when you imagine Sacramento are included. Come play in the Sacramento that never was but will always exist in our hearts.<br/><br/>Bike Route has a long history and has been in development for over 10 years. Originally called Connections the game was never published and looked like it would end up on the pile of great ideas that never were. My daughter AR kept it alive by insisting that we play. &quot;Papa lets play Connections&quot; she would say and we would play. Despite the weak art the game was good and we kept enjoying the drama of the game. Eventually we decided that it should be brought back with new artwork and Bike Route was born. Connections was at heart a game about building connections between places and it seemed a perfect fit for a game about building bike routes. The idea took off and it has kept going ever since.<br/><br/>I was play-testing Bike Route at the main library with a local family and the boy across from me said &quot;We live here...&quot; and pointed at the map. &quot;and I have been to the Zoo.&quot; he continued, indicating Land Park at the bottom of the board. Watching him I realized that a lot of kids know places in Sacramento but their mental map doesn't really connect them together. It was great to see the gears turning in his head as he saw all the places in town fit. He also knew DOCO and Old Town and quite a few other places. This was moment of affirmation; I realized that Bike Route could also bring back that great sense of place that is getting lost. Google guides us from place to place without any context or sense of relationship. Yes you can turn left and turn right but where are you?<br/><br/>I travel a lot for work and I am always happy to come home. Ususally I go to a town that is excited about what they are doing but in Sac we have it in spades. It seems that every week brings something new to our doorstep. Mabye a brand new artist or shome classy hippy selling tea. We have to recognize this exciting moment we are living in and celebrate it. Bike Route puts this fantasitc idea down on paper and freezes this instant so we can stop and savor what we have. Take a break from the hustle and bustle and enjoy a great game with family and friends. Recognize how lucky we are and enjoy it.<br/><br/>Bike route is for people who love bikes, games and Sacramento.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the days before Dwarves learned to dig and Goblins learned how to sail, Dsyx was ruled by the Titans. These giants of earth and stone built the land, made it lush or barren, for reasons unknown to the smaller folk.<br/><br/>Titans of Dsyx is a solitaire, print-and-play, roll-and-write game that takes place in the Legends of Dsyx fantasy setting. Players take on the role of Dsyx's legendary Titans, pre-historic and semi-legendary giants who terraformed the land and created the world as we know it.<br/><br/>Starting from any spot on the board, players roll dice to create different features of terrain and civilization, setting down hills, rivers, and towns on an empty map. But far from a sterile, lifeless environment, these features all react to each other, synergizing to create larger and larger terrain features, catalyzing each others' growth or destruction, or even calling down fiery meteors from the sky. Each completed feature is worth points, positive or negative, and oftentimes based on the proximity or presence of other features.<br/><br/>But the Age of the Titans is at its twilight, and the dawn of the age of the other races is fast approaching. The titans have only a precious few moment left -- as shown on a time track -- to create a lush world that will live in legend, or else an inhospitable wasteland that will cause later races to curse the titans for ages to come.<br/><br/><br/>Released in the December 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $5+ package.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Heists, piracy, and chasing legends. Pirates of Elenia is the first Adventure Pack for Middara: Unintentional Malum.<br/><br/>Adventure Packs are shorter tales that fill in the gaps of the stories from our Base Games. They represent all the stories happening behind the scenes. Each one plays a small part in the overall pictures of our narrative and world. They help to explain not only possible holes in the plot, but also to tie up events that transpire in other products.<br/><br/>While smaller than Adventure Expansions, Adventure Packs contain a significant amount of content. Each one is laden with new miniatures, new Items, new Crawl Mode content, and all the over the top value that you can expect from Succubus Publishing.<br/><br/>What makes our Adventure Packs extra special is their optional rules that can augment the stories that they&rsquo;re complementing. This comes in the form of new variants for monsters that already exist, new Adventurers for the Crawl Mode, new tiles that expand existing sets, and new Items that can be added to the store and used in our base products.<br/><br/>Adventure Packs use brand new flags that augment other Adventures and they also reference flags used in other Adventures. They&rsquo;re designed to be played in a chronological order though they can still be played in any order. Pirates of Elenia for example is designed to be played anytime after you&rsquo;ve finished Chapter 3 of Unintentional Malum.<br/><br/>Pirates of Elenia, Vol. 1 is an Adventure Pack designed for 1-4 players.<br/><br/>Over 15 encounters, more than 20 new miniatures, and a plethora of new items, monsters, and more!<br/><br/>Pirates of Elenia has a whopping 100k+ word narrative, Flags that propagate into UM2 and 3, as well as connections to larger narratives at play!<br/><br/>Requires Unintentional Malum: Act 1 to play.<br/><br/>Story Synopsis:<br/><br/>The Index Phage<br/><br/>Despite the abomination&rsquo;s presence in all the stories, the legend of The Index Phage had always been more of a wives tale than a real threat to the people of Middara. Even so, widespread rumors pegged this creature as the cause behind the horrible incurable illness called the Blight. This horrific disease had spread all across Elenia like a plague, so to Kajax and his crew, it only made sense that the citizens of Middara would tell themselves tall tales that give themselves hope.<br/>As the legend went, all you had to do was kill The Index Phage and you&rsquo;d cure the curse of the Blight.<br/><br/>But it was all too convenient, and Kajax knew that they&rsquo;d be lucky if this monster even existed at all. But the wealth put forth by the richest aristocracies in a desperate attempt at finding a cure was all too real. With a concerning distress call coming in from Hyde, the Arsen family had finally had enough. With all other avenues already exhausted, it was time to chase legends and try the absurd.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the start of a project, the first two questions a wargame designer asks himself are: what is the area I wish to in the game, and at what scale do I show it? 2nd FLEET, which is a follow-on game to the successful 6th FLEET, was irrevocably tied to the scale of its older cousin (roughly 50 miles per hex). The emphasis of the new game is on carrier operations in the Norwegian Sea; the two maps used in the game are centered on the North Atlantic, from Greenland to Norway (on an east-west axis) and from the Kola Peninsula to the northern tip of Ireland (on a south-north axis). Even using two maps, the &quot;southern approaches&quot; to the British Isles (that is, the sea route skirting the southern Irish coast) had to be omitted from the game due to space constraints. Since an important part of the simulation deals with the movement of convoys from the United States and Canada to Europe, the realism of 2nd FLEET can be enhanced if the NATO player is permitted to use the slower but safer southern approach to Europe for his convoys.<br/><br/>Using the expansion map, counters and rules included in this article, 2nd FLEET players will have more maneuver room for their surface and submarine units. (But unfortunately will have less maneuver room on their dining room tables!) As a result, both players' strategic options will be increased. Moreover, each side will have more units to play with. since the addition of the southern approaches will also add some naval forces that had been omitted from the original game-most importantly, the powerful French Atlantic squadron.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As the war progressed the little Valentine was surpassed by larger tanks, capable of mounting heavier guns and more armour.<br/><br/>The Valentine Expansion Pack brings another first to the World of Tanks Miniatures Game, being the first light tank. Traditionally light tanks combine high speed with the ability to scout out and distract enemy tanks, providing friendly tanks with an easier kill.<br/><br/>",

Those could be an election rally, fundraising or an election trail. But they could also be a little less friendly forms of rivalry like incitement against political opponents, manipulation or propaganda. The player has to remember however, to plan these actions out carefully because all the campaign workers have their own distinct abilities, useful in specific situations, and only a limited number of them can carry out their tasks in each round. Moreover, the players have to predict the moves and the plans of their opponents, as the cards are placed on the board face down. They know where their opponents are sending their people, but they do not know which ones and with what tasks. They can also use their campaign workers to cooperate with the media, which can influence the turnout in several regions of the country as well as the topics important for the local communities. <br/>Additionally, the players must prepare an election program for their candidates and make sure that they fulfil as many promises as possible. Each mistake means a loss of votes and the risk of defeat.<br/><br/>Campaign workers&rsquo; actions influence the endorsement in each region and allow the candidates to earn endorsement points there. The one with the most endorsement points becomes the winner in the given region and gains votes from the local electorate which can represent one of 4 social groups.<br/><br/>The player with the most votes in all social groups at the end of the game wins the elections and becomes president. <br/>But remember that politics is often a brutal fight which doesn&rsquo;t always encourage fair play, and media manipulation, provocation or leakage of compromising material are only a few of the challenges you will have to face. Everybody wants to win, and they will do anything to reach their goal.<br/><br/>Do you have the guts to grab for power?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Quest number 15: is your party ready for the ancient adversaries?<br/><br/>Can you master the magic of the jungle's sacred totems to quell the fiery beast that lives at the heart of this place?<br/><br/>The lava dwarves of the lost island are mystically born of earth and fire. Though their ancestors were common dwarves, generations of living in the presence of the island's primal elemental magic has infused them with a fiery essence that cannot be restrained. Molten fire runs through their veins, and their hearts smolder with fervor. They are children of the volcano.<br/><br/>Those who challenge the lava dwarves must be prepared to face the flames. In the dungeon, lava dwarves inflict damage that keeps on burning turn after turn. Their flames likewise burn the Champions' weapons, gear, and magic items. Not even the Champions' Totem cards are safe from the dwarves' devouring heat. All the same, the lairs of the lava dwarves are full of treasure, which means the reward for confronting them is definitely worth the blistering risk.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

More sinister still, those affected appear to lose their volition, becoming vessels for a power and will not their own. While little is known about these emotionless Voidcursed Thralls, what is certain is that they are entirely devoted to their mysterious cause, forgoing sleep, safety, and in some cases survival. Those who seek to prevent or defeat them risk falling prey to the same cosmic hex, their flesh being slowly claimed by the star-dotted blackness of the Void itself, until they are little more than silhouettes.<br/><br/>Get stuck into Warhammer Underworlds or mix up your game with the complete Voidcursed Thralls Rivals deck, usable by any warband &ndash; including those from past seasons. These cards can be used as a standalone deck in Rivals games, mixed with a warband's unique cards for Nemesis games, or used to build a deck from the ground-up in Relic games. This deck doesn&rsquo;t include any spells, so warbands from any season can put it to good use.<br/><br/>Each card is brand new to the game, focused on making your fighters Voidcursed so they can unleash hidden powers. Aggressive warbands with numerous fighters such as the Grinkrak&rsquo;s Loorncourt, The Headsmen&rsquo;s Curse, and Ephilim&rsquo;s Pandemonium will find Voidcursed Thralls particularly suited to their play style.<br/><br/>This deck contains a 33-card universal Rivals deck, consisting of:<br/><br/>     12x objective cards<br/>     10x gambit cards<br/>     10x upgrade cards<br/>     1x plot card with additional rules for using the Voidcursed Thralls deck<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

While Bread is analogous to Grain (the way Coin is analogous to Ore in Cities and Knights), Beer is a commodity that can only be produced on a Grain intersection when a new Diocese building is present.  Beer is used to create Beer Festivals which affect an opponent's Road, Ship, Settlement or City for a period of time; this action can lower the Victory Point total for that opponent!<br/><br/>The third edition of Kirche, Glaube &amp; Reformation (&quot;Church, Faith and Reformation&quot;) also incorporates another unofficial fan expansion, Hexen, Zauberer & Drachen (fan expansion for Catan: Cities and Knights) (&quot;Witches, Wizards &amp; Dragons&quot;), which introduces a Wizard token, Magic Development Calendars, Magic Progress card set and Magic commodity cards.  Magic commodities can only be collected on a brick intersection when a new Citadel building is present.<br/><br/>This combined version requires a custom 12 sided event die (6 barbarian ships and 6 city gates, the last of which is a &quot;wild card&quot; gate allowing the player who rolled the dice to choose the color gate).<br/><br/>If played separately, each fan expansion requires a custom 8 or 10 sided event side (4 barbarian ships and 4 city gates or 5 barbarian ships and 5 city gates, the last of which is a &quot;wild card&quot; gate).<br/><br/>Adds tactical complexity to the game and game length.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",

To win the game, you must trade in stocks and art and be the first player to own a yacht and have 50,000 in cash!<br/><br/>The trading is usually done through auctions. The stocks have no price and have no value when the game is over, but pay out a dividend as long as the game is still going. The art cards are also bought through auctions, but they get their value from the drawing of action cards with the chance of getting an art buyer card to sell the art.<br/><br/>There are also many chances to bluff and trade with your opponents during the game and many different strategies of how to win. Stay in cash, get all the stocks, only buy art or sell your cards to other players. The yacht may be bought only once every seventh turn, so get your money together and time it right. You might not want the other players to think that you are about to win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Gladiator: Just saying the word conjures up visions of vicious combat between desperate men who fought to the death for the amusement of the crowd. These games of death, originally started to honor the dead (the munus), began in 264 BC and continued through the Roman Empire in one form or another for over 900 years until abolished in 681 AD. Now with Red Sands Blue Sky - Heroes of the Arena you can recreate the glory and splendor of these games on three levels.<br/><br/>As a gladiator you fight your way through the Empire in hopes of reaching the Colosseum in Rome and perhaps the ultimate glory, the wooden sword of freedom, the rudis. Or perhaps you would rather be a lanista, the trainer or manager of gladiators forming your own troupe or familia gladiatoria. And the third way to play Red Sand Blue Sky - Heroes of the Arena is as the owner of a ludus or gladiator school seeking to reach the ultimate honor, a school in Rome herself.<br/><br/>Red Sand Blue Sky - Heroes of the Arena gives you everything you need to do this and much more. But perhaps the best thing about the game is that it can be played solo against the game mechanics, cooperatively with all players on the same side, or competitively, head to head against your friends.<br/><br/>At the core, the game pits gladiators against other gladiators or animals in arena combat.  Gladiator stats determine how many dice are rolled, and &quot;successes&quot; are then counted from among the dice.  Each combatant, however, has a certain number of &quot;bonus&quot; dice which he may allocate throughout the game to improve his chances.  Tactics enter the game in knowing when to use these dice.<br/><br/>Campaign rules allow you to follow your gladiator's career as he strives to earn his freedom.<br/><br/>A player may also opt to play as a Lanista, building a school of gladiators, buying and training slaves, pitting them against other players (or against the game mechanics) and earning money by wagering on their performances, or selling them to other schools after they have outgrown the region of the empire in which your school resides.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Red Sand, Blue Sky: Death in the Arenas of Rome<br/><br/><br/>",

You must make several trips back and forth to port, re-loading your limited RumRunner hand with the best combination of rum, crew and florin cards. Changing winds and tides affect which areas of the board are navigable and how far you can sail on each turn. The waters are also full of whirlpools that can twist your fortunes for good as well as ill. Other players can set the local seamonster upon you to cause trouble, or sail abreast to start a skirmish with their ferocious or charming crew and steal your profits. The player who successfully stows the most florins safely aboard their galleon (and has a decent crew to defend them) claims victory.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players who have adjacent pieces to these new placed park(s) score at this moment. If a house is placed on the center of the sideline directly adjacent to this space (2 points) or at the corner (if diagonally adjacent, valued 2 points) or only on the adjacent space but at another line or corner (1 point).<br/><br/>Whenever a full square of houses could be build (3 houses creating an &quot;L&quot;) a tower is placed onto the fourth space. These towers score only at the end of the game, depending on the majority around them. (Same scoring as parks, but you don't actually score the points.

This system is know for:<br/><br/><br/>     fast play time (1.5 hours)  <br/>     simple rules (1 page quick start rules)<br/>     stunning components (real canvas period map with hardwood kriegsspiel style blocks.)<br/><br/><br/>Units move by Corps in random order (chit pull).  Your HQs can attempt to alter this sequence.  This recreates the random chaos of battlefields.   Players must watch for timing opportunities / threats; and be able to adapt their plans to battlefield conditions. You can order your troops forward but you can&rsquo;t be certain WHEN they will move.<br/><br/>There are no hexes or areas in this game.  Pieces simply move mini style across the terrain.<br/><br/>No CRT.  Players simply roll dice to score hits in combat.  Normally, you resolve combat at the end of each turn, after all units have moved.  French Guard and Cavalry units have the special ability to resolve combat immediately during the turn after they move.  Combined with Napoleon's ability to easily alter the turn sequence, this becomes a very dynamic and dangerous weapon.<br/><br/>The French are badly outnumbered in this battle.  The Austrians have a 4:1 artillery advantage.  The French must exercise patience and caution at first.  A French Cavalry and Guard charge can shatter the Austrian army in one blow, IF unleashed at the right time and place.<br/><br/>You can play in multiplayer teams (up to 8 players) with each player controlling 1 Corps with restricted communication.<br/><br/>",

The alternate reality Worf, Regent of the Alliance, places little trust in his highest officers and often takes matters into his own hands, leading his forces aboard his massive Negh'Var-class flagship. With a crew of Klingons, Cardassians and Bajorans, this intimidating ship can travel at warp 9 to hunt down and punish rebels seeking to restore their empire to its former glory.<br/>This expansion adds a new ship and a new set of cards to Star Trek: Attack Wing.<br/><br/>",

Basically ARVN defenders backed up by air power vs. hordes of NVA with tanks and heavy artillery. This was the last stand of the South Vietnamese Army against all odds (which is why it may become an ATO issue game). The ARVN 18th division armed with M-48 Tanks and Cluster bombs conduct themselves in a heroic manner, so much so, that it becomes noticed by the outside world media press. The battle involved large amounts of aircraft and tanks. The ARVN defiant stand stunned the three NVA Divisions assigned to take the town. The two sides clashed for 10 days-it became a battle of honor! This game is a much improved version of Perry's earlier 1982 game.<br/><br/>System is similar to Perry Moore's Nanawa: Verdun in the Chaco War, July 1933.<br/><br/>",

It is a comprehensive game with several bomber models, mission details and a large selection of targets.<br/><br/>The game reflects the twin engine B-26 Marauder and situations and events which crews experienced on their missions. If you add the advanced rules you will find &ldquo;B-26&rdquo; to become deep and detailed and you will find yourself in situations where you may have to make decisions that will affect not only the success of your mission, but the fate of your bomber and crew. Historical accuracy has been an important guideline throughout the development of this game, though there are also some &rdquo;what-if,&rdquo; fictional, aspects added.<br/><br/>You can begin your campaign flying missions from bases in England then move to the continent later. You will find your station either in England, France, Belgium or the Netherlands, depending on when you fly your campaign. Put together a crew, name your B-26 and fly missions over France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxemburg, Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia!<br/><br/>",

There are four players in partnerships of two teams.<br/><br/>A standard 52 card deck is used, each suit ranking in the usual way from Ace (high) down to two (low). The game is played in a counterclockwise fashion. The teams stay together for all the games of a set.  The two members of each team are seated across each other, often on a table in such a way that no player can see the cards of other players (see seating charting image). Either player of a team may collect the winning tricks.<br/><br/>The first dealer is chosen at random and after each hand the turn to deal passes to the right. The cards are shuffled and cut by the player to the dealer's left, and are all dealt out beginning with player to the dealer's right, one at a time or in groups of thirteen (13), so that everyone has 13 cards.<br/><br/>",

But it did&hellip;<br/><br/>Now decades after the last war, mankind fights for survival on the battlefields of a post-apocalyptic earth. WARLANDS pits the last human survivors against each other and the unnatural horrors that breed in the wastelands and dead cities. Strap yourself in for high octane action from small scale skirmishes to epic battles, The WARLANDS sing with the screams of the dying and the roar of machines&hellip;<br/><br/>WARLANDS is a turbo-charged miniature game of cinematic combat set in the ruins of a post-apocalyptic earth. Where the last remnants of Man battle for supremacy and resources against mutants, the dead and each other! Where the warriors of the <br/>wastelands want but one thing, the black gold, the guzzoline.&quot;<br/><br/>Warlands is a miniatures wargame involving vehicular combat in a post-apocalyptic (Road Warrior, Deathrace, Doomsday, etc. inspired) setting.  Players can build forces of weaponized cars, trucks, dune-buggies, bikes, walkers, as well as foot infantry.<br/><br/>Gameplay is quick and is alternating activation.  Players roll for initiative, and each activates a model, based on speed, where they move, shoot, accelerate, decelerate and perform special actions (emergency braking, bootlegger reverse, un-jam weapon, etc).  Once all activations have been performed the turn ends.<br/><br/>Each vehicle type (Car, Truck, Buggie, Semi, Walker, etc) has their own special abilities and base attributes.  These include their speed and maneuverability, ability to absorb damage, and off-road capabilities.<br/><br/>Shooting involves die rolling, where shooter must roll higher than a fixed target value, based on the target's current speed (the faster it's going, the harder it is to hit).  Models in very close range get extra bonuses to hit.  Shooting has critical success / failure mechanisms, where a success would be an auto hit and a failure results in a weapons jam.<br/><br/>Damage is modified by the target's armor and the weapons armor penetration value.  This will determine the target value for the dice rolled to damage the target.  Each target has a number of hit points.  Critical damage rolls result in special damage to a vehicle that can range from degrading its performance to outright destroying it in a ball of fire.<br/><br/>Movement has compulsory movement to simulate momentum, and varies by the model type and current speed.  Each model has a number of 45 degree turns it's allowed within a turn and how far it must move in a straight line before it can turn again.  Special Maneuvers require a die roll to beat a target value, the roll is modified by the driver's skill, current vehicle speed and available turns the vehicle has.  Success generally means the vehicle can turn or maneuver any way it wants, failure results in random movement or total wipe-out of vehicle.<br/><br/>The scale is 20mm and is compatible with most die-cast toy cars (Matchbox, Hotwheels, etc.).  The line will include not only vehicles but blister packs of weapons and customization bitz to upgrade existing toy cars.  At first this seems odd for a miniatures wargaming scale, but the movement works well within a 4x4 table and being able to customize toy cars will be a hobby in itself.<br/><br/>",

At the beginning we choose one of 3 available places to start the adventure which we mark on the map. Then you use the dice to reinforce your crew and ship, so created points can be used to travel on land and sea. The moment you get to the adventure you can complete it using dice with specific values. In this way we travel all over the map (collecting rum by the way) and keeping the rule that we can not use the same route twice, so you have to plan your journey in advance. After 7 turns we count points for travels and adventures.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Islamic State: Libya War (ISLW) is set in a near future scenario, late in this decade, where the Libyan and Tunisian states have collapsed into civil war, pitting Radical Islamists versus Nationalist forces, with most radical Islamists pledging loyalty to the Islamic State (IS) after the arrival of well-trained, elite IS cadres from Iraq and Syria. These IS forces defeated the Tripoli-based Muslim brotherhood forces and the Tobruk-based Nationalist government.<br/><br/>Now having control of most of Libya and Tunis, the new rogue state launched terror attacks against touristic resorts in Southern Greece, Italy and Spain. This, coupled with the arrival of huge masses of migrants fleeing from the war, threatened with destabilizing the southern shores of the European Union, which were already suffering the effects of a systemic, decade-long economic crisis. The IS got hold of oil and gas producing areas in Libya, thus financing their activities in Iraq and Syria, the Sahel, Sub Saharan Africa and elsewhere, with the aim of expanding militarily towards Sudan, Algeria, Chad and Mali. In a desperate attempt to stabilize the North African region, a coalition formed by the EU, the US, Egypt and the surviving anti-Islamist forces in Tunis and Libya launch a stabilization campaign spearheaded by elite special operation forces.<br/><br/>Libya War explores the first few weeks of that hypothetical pacification campaign scenario. The Western countries (US, NATO) and their Arab Allies (Tunisians and Libyan nationalists) are controlled by the player. The Islamic State (&ldquo;IS&rdquo; from now on) is controlled by the system.<br/><br/>Designed by Javier Romero and developed by Ty Bomba.

One player represents the British command, and the other the leadership of the Rebels. Both sides are trying to gain control of India. The game system is based on the one originally presented in our earlier S&amp;T games: They Died with Their Boots On, Volumes 1 &amp; 2 (S&amp;T 236 &amp; 242). It uses an interactive sequence of play in which command, rebellions and events are randomly generated. The British Empire player controls British Regular, Punjab (including Sikh), Loyal Sepoy, Auxiliary and Nepalese forces. The Rebels initially control no forces but will gain them from Sepoy and Rebel Badmashes units which mutiny. Both players can also mobilize various Princely State forces. Each turn represents roughly two months of time. Each hexagon is about 40 miles across. Each unit represents anywhere from 2000 to 10,000 troops. Leaders represent major commanders, their staffs, and guard troops.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters<br/><br/>Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #320<br/><br/>",

Grow crops and raise livestock, either selling them to the various citizens in the town for silver, or attaching complete fields and flocks to structures for additional prestige. Fields &amp; Flocks also includes more Characters, Citizens, Visitors, and Events, so each game is a unique experience.<br/><br/>Most new action takes place during the Harvest phase. This adds a worker placement mechanic to the game, where your serfs can interact with Fields and Flocks, as well as Citizens and structures. Depending on the Citizens in town and the structures in play, different strategies are available.<br/><br/>As an added bonus, the expansion comes with a full reprint of all cards from the base game. These will be printed on higher quality card stock, along with a switch to symbols instead of color bars on structures and the inclusion of district symbols to avoid confusion and aid color blind players. Some art which originally came out darker than anticipated will be rebalanced to ensure everything looks great.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Green Hell: The Board Game is a non-legacy, campaign, survival, fully cooperative game for 1-4 players. The board game follows the recipe for success implemented by its electronic counterpart, by introducing a highly optimizable set of survival mechanics, pitting players against a changeable and unpredictable jungle environment. The core mechanics of the game are:<br/><br/>Exploration:<br/><br/>Players are all members of a search and rescue party, sent into the Amazon rainforest to locate Jake Higgins - the protagonist known from the computer game. Avoiding too many spoilers, the plot of the board game campaign runs its own course and uses some hallmark elements of the overarching Green Hell story, without spoiling the electronic adventure to anyone.<br/><br/>Apart from the characters in the team - who have varying roles and asymmetric skills (the Survival Expert, the Guide, the Medic, the Scientist) the other main character of the game is the jungle itself. With a map based on random card setup, providing modularity (no two games of the same scenario will look the same), and an ever-expanding area to cover (each scenario will allow players to uncover a part of a greater region, and sometimes the players will have to backtrack to an already known location) the jungle creation system introduces variability and unpredictability to each session.<br/><br/>Resources -&gt; Backpack -&gt; Crafting:<br/><br/>You can&rsquo;t have a survival game without crafting and collecting resources! Green Hell: the Board Game allows you to collect resources in various ways. Luck based dice rolls for the most basic and universal resource, harvesting map locations for larger and more scarce resources, or interacting with specific, rare, tiles for unique resources which, when uncovered, can be a reward in themselves.<br/><br/>These resources will be needed to craft weapons, armor, and some items required to finish Scenarios in the campaign.<br/><br/>As any experienced survivalist knows, a backpack is an important part of the system and knowing what and how much we can fit cleverly into our backpack to optimize space is crucial. The Board Game addresses this issue by representing resources as polyominoes which need to be fitted into a specific grid of the character&rsquo;s backpack. Optimization is key!<br/><br/>Survival:<br/><br/>Food and water are crucial as well. Apart from crafting their weapons and other useful items, players will need to remember about food and drink. Their weakened and increasingly exhausted characters can be more of a burden than help for the team.<br/><br/>Camp:<br/><br/>A safe place for the team to spend the night, prepare food, and rest. The camp will be a board with slots for buildings and upgrades. Players will need to decide which buildings they need first and what to spend their limited resources on. Should they craft an animal trap first? Or maybe a water collector? Do they light a fire tonight and roast some meat? Or will they eat it raw risking a parasitic infection?<br/><br/>Luck is a factor:<br/><br/>Players will be able to plan ahead, harvest and craft to prepare themselves for the upcoming task but the jungle is unpredictable and one can never predict everything. We are trying to avoid random elements wherever we feel that the players should be able to plan and succeed, but luck is a factor as well.<br/><br/>Every night, after all the players used up their actions, the luck cubes will be tossed into the Creepy Tree, which will tell the players how much bad luck they&rsquo;ve accumulated. Depending on their bad luck level, the events of each night may vary from completely safe to verging on the brink of death.<br/><br/>Players will be encouraged to find ways to mitigate their bad luck over time for fear of failing their mission.<br/><br/>&ndash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The player with the most stock of a particular company in his possession acts as the president of this company and is responsible for track laying, the placement of railheads (which are necessary for train runs), route selection and train acquisition. Running trains earns money and this money is either divided by the shareholders or kept in the company's treasure for further investments (like buying better trains or constructing track). This decision influences the value of the company's shares - and not the player with the most stock or the most beautiful constructed track wins the game, but the player with the most riches in terms of cash and shares.<br/><br/>The game differs from the usual 18xx games a little, as it uses different tokens for either passenger trains or freight trains. The companies also face a lot of building costs - mountains, Amazonas swamps, and crossing a border into another country costs extra.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Girl Genius: The Works is a non-collectible card game that consists of several standalone decks of cards. You can play the game with any one of those decks, while also being able to combine some or all of those decks into a single deck for a longer game or a game with more players. Each deck contains many unique cards, but the gameplay is the same in all cases.<br/><br/>Each player gets a five-card hand and twelve cards are laid out face-down in a patchwork pattern. Each card has colored symbols along each side, as well as a point value and special instructions. On your turn, you reveal one face-down card, then spin any face-up card 180&ordm;. After spinning, if any of the symbols on the edges of the spun card match the symbols on one or more of the surrounding cards, you &quot;pop&quot; the card(s) with the most matching symbols. &quot;Popping&quot; a card means that you must follow the instructions on the card (whether helpful or harmful), then (usually) add it to your score pile. Cards in your hand are used to replace any popped cards. The game is played until one player has 70/50/40/30 points with two/three/four/more than four players.<br/><br/>The Castle Heterodyne deck includes themes and characters from Agatha's time in Castle Heterodyne, and her early days in Mechanicsburg. There are two major blocks of cards in this deck: Prisoners and Minions. Castle Heterodyne is a huge semi-conscious prison, and many of the characters in the story are stuck there. Thus, the Castle says, &quot;If you have four Prisoners in your Score Pile right now, you win.&quot; But accumulating four of them can sometimes be pretty painful. Some of them mess up the board when you pop them, screwing up your plans. Others mess with your hand and Score Pile.<br/><br/>The nine Minions in this deck have both good effects and bad, with other cards providing support for Minions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Morituri Te Salutant is a miniatures rule set for gladiatorial combat. It was initially published by Gladiator Miniatures but the current (3rd) edition came out from Black Hat Miniatures in 2008. According to the preface for the latest edition there are no significant differences between the 2nd and the 3rd edition of the game.<br/><br/>MTS consists of rulebook (either a pdf or a hard copy); miniatures, dice, markers (beads, etc) and the playing surface have to be provided by the players. The game uses six and twenty-sided dice. Miniatures of any scale may be used.<br/><br/>The game is played on a hex grid using pre-selected moves for each gladiator. The moves can be written down on a piece of paper but another popular alternative is to create separate cards for each move. The selected moves are compared on a matrix that gives the difficulty for a strike to hit the opponent. As the game goes on the gladiators gain wounds of varying severity and eventually the loser is either killed or begs for mercy from the crowds.<br/><br/>The game includes a system for playing campaigns where each player represents a gladiator school. Initially the schools own half a dozen or so gladiators of varying types (myrmidon, hoplomachon, thracian, etc). Over a campaign year the schools participate in festivals where they compete for the prize money but also can bet between each other. As the campaign progresses individual gladiators gain experience, die, get wounded, and may even earn their freedom. The schools use the money they earn to buy new gladiators but the unfortunate may be driven to bankruptcy.<br/><br/>There are 12 different gladiator types each of which has a different selection of moves. For example, a spear-armed hoplomachus has different moves than a retiarius who wields a trident and a net.<br/><br/>In addition to regular gladiatorial combat, the game includes rules for mounted combat, archery and beast fights. Multi-gladiator and multi-player combats are possible allowing team fights, last-man-standing games etc.<br/><br/>Some play aids can be downloaded from the publisher's Yahoo group. They include a pdf of a hex grid and labels for creating your own move cards.<br/><br/>",

After two decades of peace and prosperity, the city holds it&rsquo;s breath on the verge of an all out WAR. Now it is time to restore order and take what is yours ...<br/><br/>Take control of one of the Five Families in a quest to become Boss of all Bosses.<br/><br/>Players take turns to complete 3 phases:<br/><br/>1. MONEY<br/>Money is collected at the start of each turn. The bank pays out cash from business sites and when a player advances in rank, he receives some cash from other players as well. Now take a Commission card or an FBI card from the pile in the middle of the board and continue to the POWER (or: action) phase of the game.<br/><br/>2.POWER<br/>Each turn players can move their pawn up to 5 spaces. As you move around the board, territory is claimed by placing chips on empty spaces. If a space is already claimed by another player, it can be conquered using the weapon cards. Win the battle and replace the opponents token with your own. One can attack using the weapon cards on hand, and / or visit a GANG on the board and pay them to carry out an attack.<br/><br/>3. RESPECT<br/>At the end of each turn, players can buy cards. This can be business site cards, weapon cards or both. There are 3 types of business, 4 of each type. The more sites you own from one type, the more you earn per site. Business sites are bought from the bank, weapon cards from other players. All weapon cards are sold from the same main stack. Deposit cash for points and finish your turn by moving the tracker chip tot he next player.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN<br/><br/>There are 3 ways to win the game:<br/><br/>1.    POINTS    The 1st player to reach the top on the score ladder, wins. <br/>2.    MISSION    The 1st player to defeat an assigned opponent, wins. <br/>3.    AREA    The 1st player to have placed all 30 area chips on the board, wins.<br/><br/>Key to winning GAMBONI is to find the right balance between RISK and REWARD. The game involves tactics, strategy, diplomacy, bluffing, risk taking as well as a portion of luck. One must be agressive and active but know when to stop and whom to attack and whom to keep as a friend ...<br/><br/>The early bird might catch a worm but the second mouse gets the cheese!<br/><br/>Each Family has their own special ability, suiting different strategies and personalities (image above, from left to right);<br/><br/>DiNero (GREEN): Starts with 3 bulletproof vest cards. Special ability: HAND SIZE +2 - Most suitable for defensive players who like to build up before going to war.<br/>Luchetti (WHITE): Starts with 3 consigliere cards. Special ability: BAIL LEVEL -2 - Most suitable for balanced players who don't mind some backstabbing and betrayal.<br/>Montano (RED): Starts with 3 minigun weapon cards. Special ability: WEAPON BUY +2 - Most suitable for aggressive players who like action and don't like waiting.<br/>Borghese (BLUE): Starts with $ 15,000 extra. special ability: DEPOSIT $40k - Most suitable for balanced players who enjoy building businesses and gain power via money. <br/>Garrone (BLACK): Starts with 3 getaway car cards. Special ability: MOVEMENT +2 - Most suitable for players who like to play aggessively and enjoy provoking their enemies.<br/><br/>",

Wars are won and lost in the conference room, the lab, the stock exchange, the factory floor, and the massive shipyards in orbit over your colonies, just as much as they are in the carnage of battle.<br/><br/>Victory by Any Means is a sci-fi strategic wargame that can interface with existing tactical wargames or operate as a stand-alone campaign system. Unlike some campaign systems, Victory by Any Means is easy to run -- both for players and game masters alike. The ease of play is more impressive considering the breadth of the rules: research, intel, space and ground combat, colony management, exploration -- rules for all of these elements (and more) are included in the Victory by Any Means Campaign Guide.<br/><br/>This system is designed to integrate seamlessly with your favorite game universe and genre by using of a modular rule architecture. This core rulebook includes several sample alien empires, star maps, and scenarios to get you started, along with rules and ideas for creating your own campaign source materials. Other pre-created source materials are available, both in print and online, to expand the Victory by Any Means experience.<br/><br/>",

The mechanic is a 2 card draw: You draw a card, decide to play it or discard it. If played then draw and discard the next card. If discarded then draw and play the second card.<br/><br/>Once either 3 laundry items of the same colour, or 5 of different colours, are hanging on the line (multi coloured, stripey, clothes being 'wild') they are dry and can be placed in the player's laundry basket to be scored at the end of the game.<br/>There are some special sets to collect for bonuses and also Event cards for various effects.<br/><br/>Washing Lines was an entry in the 2017 Children's Game Print and Play Design Contest where it was voted<br/>Best Game for Early Elementary School Children<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The egg hunt is in disarray. Can you crack the case?<br/><br/>The Easter Escapade, title #8 in the Holiday Hijinks line, is an escape room style game in just 18 cards! As a group, you will solve a series of puzzles to unravel a mystery.<br/><br/>Puzzles may test your perception, wordplay, and lateral thinking. English language fluency is required.<br/><br/>This game is app-assisted. When you have solved a puzzle on the cards, you will enter the answer into the companion web app (compatible with all smart phones and computers) and it will check whether you are correct. If you are, the app will tell you which card or cards to take next. The app also contains a graduated hint system, so if you get stuck you can get just a small hint about the current puzzle to get moving again without giving too much away.<br/><br/>The app also allows you to interact with objects on cards, in the vein of a classic point-and-click adventure. This will help you gain more clues and solve puzzles.<br/><br/>This system is non-desctructible: some groups may choose to write on cards, but this is not required. A group cannot re-play the game, but can pass it on to another group for their use.<br/><br/>This entry in the series takes about an hour to solve, and is rated 2 out of 3 in difficulty.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The system rules will be a maximum of 16 pages long including examples and notes and a lot of pictures.<br/>Nothing is set in stone, yet, but the scale is something like 1500 meters per hex and three turns per day (morn, noon, night). Units will be divisions and brigades.<br/>Combat happens in hex during movement. There will be no chits drawn out of cups, but there will be messengers carrying orders around on the map. There will be no rules with French names, but there will be a stress on the quirks of characters involved.<br/><br/>",

Maneuvering on a board cast entirely of shadow and light, you play your hand of magical lures and traps against the other snyx hunters to be the first to capture the pesky snyx.<br/><br/>Each player receives a hand of 5 cards, from which they'll play 3 each turn. The cards control the movement of the Snyx or the shape of the game board. The board is comprised of light and shadows made from the Larklamp, and by sliding the panels on the lantern, the board can be modified. The Snyx is moved according to the cards played each round. The more cards you match in the 3 cards you play, the more likely that that respective card will resolve. The goal of the game is to maneuver the Snyx to a specific location.<br/><br/>",

Once all the pieces are used, the players count how many squares of their colour can be seen from above, looking down on the board. The player with the most visible squares in their colour, wins.<br/><br/>The first edition is hand-made with wooden cubes joined in shapes up of to four cubes (the game comes with JP and ENG rules). Each player has shapes in their draw bag, one set being light, the other dark. But some of the shapes are painted with the other player's colour (including a 50% piece), so the player might be helping the opponent unwillingly depending on how they place the piece.<br/><br/>Each player has 10 pieces to place on the small starting grid. The player's take turns and may not play the same piece in succession. Each piece must be off-set against existing pieces, so player's cannot simple block over like with like. Gaps must not be left under pieces, so the construction must be snug. And if a player cannot place their piece, they lose.<br/><br/>When all the pieces are placed, the game ends and the squares are counted.<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>ã·ã³ãã«ãªããã­ãã¯ãç©ã¿ä¸ããã²ã¼ã ã§ãã<br/><br/>äº¤äºã«ãã­ãã¯ãç½®ãã¦ããã<br/>21åãã¹ã¦ã®ãã­ãã¯ãç½®ããã®ã¡ã<br/>ä¸ããè¦ããã­ãã¯ã®æ°ãå¤ããã¬ã¤ã¤ã¼ã®åå©ã§ãã<br/><br/>",

Of course, Elspeth isn't the only one to take advantage&mdash;other denizens of the Underworld are seizing the opportunity to plan escapes of their own.

Meanwhile, the nightmare mage Ashiok has dark designs of their own...<br/><br/>Theros Beyond Death features the return of the Devotion mechanic from Theros and the Constellation mechanic from Journey into Nyx, and introduces a new mechanic, Escape, that allows spells to be cast from the graveyard. The set contains 254 cards (5 basic lands, 101 commons, 80 uncommons, 53 rares, and 15 mythic rares), and is sold in draft boosters, collector boosters, theme boosters, and bundles. Two preconstructed planeswalker decks, an Elspeth deck and an Ashiok deck, were released alongside the main set as well.<br/><br/>",

Funkoverse uses an innovative &ldquo;cooldown&rdquo; system &mdash; the more powerful the ability, the longer it will take for the ability token to become available again &mdash; so players have to spend their ability tokens wisely. Each character in Funkoverse is unique, so players are encouraged to try out different combinations of characters and items in order to discover their favorite synergies and powerful strategies for the different game scenario.<br/><br/>Funkoverse Strategy Game: Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas 101 is an expansion for any standalone Funkoverse title, consisting of the trick-or-treaters Lock, Shock, and Barrel from the film The Nightmare Before Christmas.

        "description": "Scoreboard Baseball is a full-stat quick-play baseball game that can be played in around 10-12 minutes from out of the box to stat completion. There are no lineups to decide upon and no score sheets to fill out yet the game unfolds inning by inning with a key player and action being revealed along the way. While it can be used to add on to existing full play baseball games, such as Inside Pitch Baseball, it can also hold its own as a season replay game.<br/><br/>Each team is represented by a single chart that shows all of the possible players and how they effect scoring in an inning when called upon to deliver as a key player. It could be the 3rd string catcher that comes through or maybe your backup shortstop. One roll per inning gets you all the action plus all the pitchers stats for that inning.<br/><br/>All hitters are rated for, basically, runs created. This is how runs can be scored during an inning. They also have ratings for HR, 3B, 2B, SB and hits in general. How often a hitter is called upon is based on how many plate appearances he had during the season being replayed. The bigger the hit type, a HR beats a single, the better chance to have that big inning. How many runs a team scored in an inning during the year is recreated with Scoreboard as each team has its own scoring chart.<br/><br/>Pitchers are rated on H, K and BBs. They also have ratings which can cause runs to score in an inning or block potential runs from scoring. The pitchers' stay in the game relies upon how many hits, runs and walks he gives up in his stint. Deciding who pitches doesn't slow the game down as pitchers have start and relief ranges that you can use to &quot;coach&quot; the team.<br/><br/>Relievers are not left out of the mix as all their appearances and stats can be tracked as well. When to bring in a certain reliever is also covered with 7 different scoring/inning breakdowns that are based upon actual year appearances. Your middle guys will come in at the proper times and be effective (non-effective) just like the year the charts recreate.<br/><br/>While most stats are gathered during the game some loose ends must be accounted for at games' end. These are handled with each player given ranges to fill in those RBI and hit stats so that the score sheet comes out even.<br/><br/>You don't just roll for a final score in Scoreboard but you get the ebb and flow of the game broken down per inning. Sometimes your less than stellar players will need to come through in a pinch recreating the excitement of a play-by-play game just done quicker. By the end of the game, you will have these stats for the players as well as see when and how they happened in the game.<br/><br/>Pitchers: W, L, SV, IP, H, R, ER, K, BB<br/><br/>Hitters: H, 2B, 3B, HR, SB, RBI<br/><br/>After a series or two from a team, multipliers are given to each player to show how many AB he would have based on the number of games his team has played. This can be used to get you batting average leaders, etc... for your league.<br/><br/>Get on the Board with Scoreboard Baseball!<br/><br/>",

Like all Anno Domini sets, this game can be played as a standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>In Anno Domini: S&uuml;den, each player receives nine cards (or fewer, if you want the game to be shorter) and may look only at the descriptions. In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place their card in chronological order to those already present. Instead of adding a card, a player may claim that the order in which the cards have been placed is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/><br/>If the order is correct, then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order is incorrect, then the previous player &ndash; who accepted the order as correct or made it incorrect through her own placement &ndash; receives three cards. The first player with no cards remaining in hand wins.<br/><br/>",
