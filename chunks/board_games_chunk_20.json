Finally he may see the wild polar bears on their way, watch the seals fishing and fish himself through the ice holes. At most, however, he looks forward to building the igloo with the others. However, the day goes on much too fast...<br/><br/>The children have to build the igloo and to observe as many animals as possible at the same time. Who collects most animal tiles and builds the igloo successfully, will win!<br/><br/>Description of the mechanics:<br/>Enuk is a mixture of memory and push-your-luck. Players turn over animal tiles, until they want to quit or one of the animals is scared and flees: the herring flee from the salmon, salmon flees from the seal, the seal flees from the polar bear and the polar bear flees from the Eskimo. How many tiles dare you turn over?<br/><br/>",

However, you have only one minute to do so, and you are not allowed to speak...and you can't see your own cards &mdash; only the cards of the other players! Can you give the right signals and interpret your teammates' signals correctly to play everything in time?<br/><br/>To win, you need to complete six levels of play. For level 1, deal out ten cards from a deck numbered 1-40 as evenly as possible. Sort the cards face down (without showing anyone else) to stack the cards from low to high. Each player picks up their topmost card facing away from themselves so that it's visible to everyone else, then someone starts the timer. Whoever has the lowest card must play it. How will they know? Tell them with your eyes! If they play the card correctly, they pick up their next card, then you all figure out who plays next; if not, restart the level, losing the game if you fail a second time.<br/><br/>If you complete the level by playing all cards correctly, add the special cards for level 2 &mdash; smile cards &mdash; and deal 13 cards. Special cards can be stacked anywhere in a player's pile other than the topmost card. When a player holds a special card, that's considered the lowest card in play. Each level adds new special cards, such as the mirror and a second copy of some number cards, and more cards dealt to players. Make it through 25 cards in one minute at level 6, and you win!<br/><br/>",

Basically, you and the other players are stuck in an abandoned farming community, hunted by a psychotic 21 year old with 10&quot; metal blades bolted through her fingers. The game play is very gory, the odds are in Angel's favor, and you must often fight with weapons no better than a flashlight. (Or a rake if you get really lucky..) However, that's the fun of the game! You see, the point of Death Angel isn't really to &quot;win&quot;, but to survive. Face it; Angel is better. She can appear and disappear at will, she's always got a deadly weapon, and worse of all, she regenerates almost instantly. Lucky for you, she does play fair; if you out run her, she might leave you alone. If you do something silly like jump through a window, she'll go away. (If you survive the fall, you can rejoice!) If you hit her too hard, she'll disappear. (Of course, next time you see her, she's going to be pretty peeved at you.) And finally, if you survive until 5AM, she'll allow you to continue your life in peace. And so, the primary goal is not to defeat Angel, but to survive her wrath. I wouldn't bet money on surviving all 6 hours, though. Expect to lose 2, maybe 3 victims before daybreak...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Longships is a Viking-themed plunder/trading game. Players start in the North Sea with an empty Longship each, surrounded by four countries: Denmark, Norway, Scotland and England. Players have to start with plundering at least one country each in order to get some initial resources to trade with. Trading is driven by differences in the countries' resources; each country produces 2 out of the 4 resources Cloth, Furs, Thralls and Mushrooms. Nearby countries differ on one resource only, while countries on opposite sides of the North Sea have a totally different set of resources. Long-distance trading is thus more profitable, but also more dangerous as changing weather conditions can make open sea-traveling fatal.<br/><br/>The countries themselves are weak in defense and easy to plunder. However, plundering a country weakens its trading potential, so that Vikings need to defend countries they build their trade on from Vikings plundering. Plundering a country also makes its population hostile to you, so that you can't build or repair Longships there, making you more vulnerable on expeditions to those countries. The key to success is thus to keep your hostilities at an optimal level.<br/><br/>Resources gained from trading or plundering can be sacrificed to the gods in order to gain additional actions. Sacrificing Thralls to Odin gets you new fresh men to throw into the fights, sacrificing to Thor lets you change the weather conditions, get yourself a beneficial trade wind or sink your foes with mighty storms. Mushrooms make you go berserk and fight and plunder more efficiently, while Freya helps cities grow and prosper and give more trading opportunities.<br/><br/>Resources can also be used to build new Longships, increasing the Viking's trading and military power. Just like in real life, the winner at the end of the game is the player with the most Longships.<br/><br/>",

With clever deduction and cunning strategy, you can outwit your opponents and be the first to bring down the evil spymaster!<br/><br/>Early versions of the game came with a defective &quot;Spy Phone&quot; that would not trigger a secret message when picked up due to a missing button.

In this one-player game, the player controls the soldiers who defended the legations against the hordes of Boxers, controlled by an original system that manages their actions and combats. The player&rsquo;s goal is to hold on until the arrival of the rescue column, sent by land to lift the siege.<br/><br/>The map represents the Legation Quarter on a scale of 15 cm for 500 metres. A turn represents one day and the same day can be divided into several combat phases that represent the Boxers&rsquo; assaults. There is no turn counter and a deck of 54 cards must be used; each card drawn represents a day. Nine of the cards are combat cards. Once the phase system has been assimilated, it is simple to use. Plan on 3-4 hours for game play.<br/><br/>(from publisher's website)<br/><br/>",

Soon enough, you find yourself digging holes in the ground and planting seeds of every kind. But in the shadow of these stems, hungry snails are waiting, ready to dash towards your precious labor and have their fill of your little paradise. Will you be able to avoid this disaster?<br/><br/>In Spring Fever, players are planting flowers in their gardens while trying to avoid the snails that will eat these blooms. The card deck consists of a deck of cards with flowers (valued at 3) and snails (valued -1 to -10). The first player draws four cards, lays what he claims is the lowest valued card face-up in front of him, then passes the cards to the left. The next player can either:<br/><br/>&bull; Accept this player's claim, in which case she draws a card to bring the hand back up to four cards, then takes a turn herself, claiming one card, etc.<br/><br/>&bull; Or call the previous player's bluff by revealing the three cards she was passed. If the previous player lied, he must take all the snails in the three cards revealed; in addition the doubting player can hand over her largest snail or take a flower card. If the previous player told the truth, the penalties are reversed. In either case, the doubting player will take the next turn by filling her hand to four cards, choosing one card, etc.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player can't refill the hand to four cards. This player takes the lowest card remaining, then everyone tallies their points. The player with the highest total wins, with the number of flowers being the tiebreaker, if needed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tiny Farms is a fun and engaging family-friendly roll-and-write game. Tiny Farms features a simple but unique dice rondel with shared pawns that you will use to collect animals for your farms.<br/><br/>Each player is a farmer managing two 4x4 farms. On a turn, animals are drafted and placed on the farm by writing their initials (or by drawing, if you're feeling creative). Drafting involves a special rondel with eight sections containing the animals. The rondel is overlayed by a wheel with different hole patterns &mdash; the patent-pending Rolldel Wheel-o-Matic! &mdash; that reveal only two animals in each section. As the wheel rotates, different animals will be available. One red and one blue meeple travel clockwise around the rondel.<br/><br/>Each round, roll dice equal to the number of players, plus one. Players then take turn drafting a die, moving either the red or blue farmer meeple that number of sections, and placing the two animals from that section onto their farm that matches the color of the farmer. The last die remaining after all players have taken one is used to rotate the wheel.<br/><br/>Players also start with some milk tokens that can modify the values of dice by &plusmn;1.<br/><br/>The game ends after ten rounds (with your farms hopefully now being full), and players score points. Each animal has a different scoring conditions, such as sets of adjacent animals of the same kind or different kinds, or the most animals of a kind between all players. You also get points for unused milk tokens, and lose points for any size difference between your two farms.<br/><br/>",

They start by drawing two flower cards, each of which has two groups of flowers on each side, then places one group on a card by the YES side of the pixie card and a group on the other card by the NO side.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws the top flower card, chooses a group on it, then the pixie places it visibly by the YES or NO side of its card. Any player may call for a guess after this turn. If they do, the pixie draws a flower card from the deck and places it next to them to track the number of guesses, then each player writes down and reveals their guess. If anyone is correct, the round ends, with the correct guesser scoring 1 point for every two cards remaining in the deck and the pixie scoring 2 points per guess. If no one is correct, the next player takes their turn, with players taking turns until someone guesses correctly or the deck has fewer than two cards remaining.<br/><br/>After everyone has been pixie once, whoever has scored the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Use the erasable drawing board to sketch out each clue &ndash; with one cat-veat: you must use a cut-out of a furry feline in each drawing! The first player to guess five clues wins!<br/><br/>For large groups, the stakes are raised! Two teams simultaneously battle it out, sketching cat-centric clues in a race to collect 20 points.

It's almost like I'm doing him a favor when I borrow his golf clubs. Now at least he knows they're getting some use. And if he ever actually needs them, he knows where to find me. I'm sleeping on the floor at Anthony's house. He's a Gambler, and he's got the best leftovers in town! And those silk suits he never wears are almost all my size. Tomorrow I should figure out where he keeps the keys to that car he never drives.<br/><br/>Freeloader is a game celebrating the glorious pastime of living off other people's success. Players spend the game roaming the neighborhood, doing favors for their &quot;friends&quot; in exchange for great loaner stuff like the Doctor's Car, the Artist's clothes, or the Waitress' leftover food. To win the game you have to collect Food, Clothing, and Shelter before the deck runs out. It's all worth points, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>Freeloader is the best of what Cheapass Games does: a simple, entertaining board game with decent strategy and a rock-bottom price tag.

There is no combat.<br/><br/>The English version has just 69 spaces (a 9 x 9 grid but missing the three squares from each corner of the board). The samurai figures have removable swords. They engage in combat and when losing combat they first lose their swords then are removed from the board. The first player to lose three samurai loses the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blood Berets was Target Games first entry into the American gaming market. It preceded the later, more popular boardgames (Mutant Chronicles: Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen) and the English release of the roleplaying game on which it was based. Blood Berets is only slightly more complex than Siege of the Citadel and Fury of the Clansmen because it is really not much more than a streamlined version of the roleplaying game's combat system.<br/><br/>This game included many of the rules of popular wargames, including a chit-based initiative system, cover, hidden deployment, and model facing.  It too used Target Games's one hit, one armor roll system (with a d20) for fast action.  This game was distinguished by a card for each character.  When the character was hit once (or twice, for the Nepharites), the card was turned over, revealing an injured portrait and lower stats for the injured character.  When the character was hurt twice (or four times, for the Nepharites), it died. The game is enjoyable, but since it has only three mission scenarios, it does not lend itself to much variation upon repeat plays.  The human player is aware of the general location of mutants through the use of his &quot;scanner&quot; - which is counters placed on various tiles (revealed when a tile is overturned and replaced with the appropriate miniature).  Even so, the game is an enjoyable introduction to the roleplaying game and is very adaptable for those gamers who like to tinker with rules systems to develop their own variants. The subsequent development of Warzone as a tabletop miniatures wargame added a large number of metal miniatures that could be used in variants of the game.<br/><br/>Probably the most innovative part of the game (for its time) was the inclusion of 18 plastic miniatures for playing the game, each in its own foam compartment neatly stored in the bottom of the box. Six Blood Berets were included (1 Sgt., 1 Medic, and 4 Grunts), 10 Undead Legionnaires, and 2 Nepharites (bad guy leaders). Heartbreaker produced a limited line of miniatures suitable for use with Blood Berets shortly after the game was released. These miniatures were lead and featured the Bauhaus Rangers with the Deathlockdrum machine gunner and Sgt. with 4 Grunts. There were also lead minis of Nepharites and Undead Legionnaires.<br/><br/>A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 39 &amp; 40 that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Blood Berets. New scenarios, rules, items and pretorian stalkers.<br/><br/>",

Esteemed Company owner Alberta Falls will announce one of four families as temporary Company caretakers before going on sabbatical, and we&rsquo;re in the running! Since we might be your future bosses, if you keep us on board, we&rsquo;ll do the same for you. Payment dependent on arrival of cargo and passengers&hellip; preferably in one piece.<br/><br/>Disney Jungle Cruise Adventure Game is a mystery and deduction game based on the world-famous Disney Parks attraction. Players are intrepid skippers transporting valuable cargo and families of passengers through the jungle to Jungle Cruise Navigation Company Headquarters. Along the way, they&rsquo;ll collect clues to see which family might be appointed Company caretakers&mdash;these passengers are worth more points at the end of the game! They&rsquo;ll also collect lost passengers and cargo and navigate dangers that cause passengers and cargo to get lost in the jungle. The skipper to transport the most valuable cargo at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn, they will roll a movement die and move their boat forward that many spaces. They&rsquo;ll draw four Navigation cards, each of which has a danger rating and targeted boat section as well as a dangerous encounter (including hippos, giant butterflies, and ducks). As is appropriate, each Navigation card also includes a pun.<br/><br/>Players only encounter as many cards as they move (ex: two cards for two spaces). They will roll encounter dice equal to the danger rating (0-3), then remove one passenger or cargo for each ! symbol they roll from the indicated boat section. If a player doesn&rsquo;t like their roll, they can use their Warning Shot to reroll.<br/><br/>On future turns, if there are empty spaces on their boat, players will be able to collect a &ldquo;Lost &amp; Found&rdquo; token when they land on a river space. Lost and Found tokens allow players to collect lost passengers or cargo. Players will also stop at Outposts (which allow them to reload Warning Shots and collect cargo or passengers). Depending on their chosen route, players may also encounter Clue spaces (which show one of the families NOT chosen by Alberta).<br/><br/>When the first player reaches Headquarters, they may collect a tip token. Once all players have arrived, the new caretakers are revealed, and players add up their scores. Passengers belonging to the caretaker family are worth more. The player with the most points (most valuable cargo) wins!<br/><br/>",

Inside the box you will find the two teams reaching the Champions League Final in the last year. TABLE UEFA is one of the few board-games on soccer able to well represent the real atmosphere of a soccer match! Players can move on the field passing the ball, shooting, creating pressure, fouls and even being expelled. The match is really fast-paced, realistic, and as a coach you can decide the final result by using the best tactics. TABLE UEFA CHAMPIONS LEAGUE IS A GAME FOR FAMILIES BUT IT'S SO realistic that its simulation level will also capture the imagination of gamers.<br/><br/>The game is played taking turns: each turn the team owning the ball rolls a red 6 sided die and consequently moves a miniature on the field. The defending team concludes the turn with an alternative movement of 2 squares in order to mark the attacking miniatures. Each attacking miniature is marked when it has from 1 to 6 opponents in the next squares and its movements are always diminished by the same number as the opponents that mark him. The defender can then try to steal possession. Short passes are possible within 4 squares from the ball possessor and long passes and shots at goal are performed by rolling 2 white 6-sided dice. For saving shots, the goalkeeper will roll the same dice and compare the results. Special cards add tactical possibilities to any match development. The game is easy to learn and the marking rules with the alternative moves make it very similar to a soccer match: therefore any familiar playing styles are applicable.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Take a Train is a family game for two to six players of age 8 and up. The aim in the game is to enlarge your fortune thanks to smart investments in rolling stock.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of investors who meet at the locomotive auction and try to buy the best of auctioned railway vehicles. Locomotive cards are not the only ones available for purchase though, because investors also compete for the most valuable railway wagons.<br/><br/>The game is played for three rounds, each of which consists of two stages. In the first stage, the players bid locomotive cards. The auction type in each round is determined by drawing one of the six auction tokens. During the bidding of locomotive cards, the players should pay attention not only to its price, but also to the multiplier placed on the card (the higher, the greater the potential profits) as well as the locomotive speed. Once all the players have already purchased three locomotives, the second stage takes place. In this stage they are attaching wagons to their locomotives. They also make a choice: either to take one of the face-up wagon cards and attach to one of their locomotives, to pass and do not take any card, or to pay for replacing cards on the table and only then decide, whether to take one of the available wagons.<br/><br/>The round is over when one of the locomotives of any player has its fifth wagon attached. Then, all the players are summing up the profits. Each player adds up the value of the wagons attached to the locomotive, then the obtained score is multiplied by the multiplier of the locomotive. This process is repeated for each of the locomotives. The earned money supplies the player's account. After three rounds, all the players add up their earned money. The player who earned the most, wins.<br/><br/>Take a Train is an entertaining and exciting game, which gives everyone a chance to feel like a rail market tycoon.<br/><br/>",

It is still widely played today.<br/><br/>Players push ('shove') polished coins (half pennies, traditionally) along a board which has been marked out in horizontal bands, called 'beds'. The most common method is to place the coin on the bottom edge of the board, slightly overhanging, and tap it with the heel of the hand. The aim of the game is to position coins within the beds, with no part touching the bands. This requires considerable skill.<br/><br/>Players must get a coin in each bed three times. Each success is scored, often with a cribbage style peg and hole system up the side of the board or with chalk tallies.<br/><br/>Boards are made of wood or slate.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Der Feuersalamander is a deduction game with a fantasy theme. The game board shows four distinct areas associated with the four elements (air, water, fire, earth). Each area has 7 rows and three columns, showing 1,2, or 3 stones.<br/><br/>The players try to deduce a set of 3 cards (1 element, 1 row number, 1 number of stones) in play from their own and other players' cards. A player can have a maximum of two cards in their hands, and they have to be different types (e.g., no 2 element cards). On their turn, a player rolls the special dice, showing both a symbol and a number. If the salamander is rolled as the symbol, the player gets to pick up a card. If the stone symbol is rolled, the player <br/>marks one of the possible positions on the board represented by their cards on the board. In any case, the player moves their pawn according to the number rolled.<br/><br/>If another player reaches a space with another player's marker, they can ask that player for a specific card. The player has to show the questioner a Yes/No card to indicate their answer.<br/><br/>Once a player knows a set of cards, they move their pawn back to their own starting location. Upon arrival, the player states the set of cards and who has the missing card(s). If the statement is true, the player receives a number of points; if not, they end up in the dungeon. The game ends after a player reaches a certain number of points.<br/><br/>Der Feuersalamander is the third game in Noris' Fantasy trilogy, with Die Drei Magier and Das Blaue Amulett being the first and second.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Very simply, this is a card-and-board simulation of football (a.k.a. Soccer).  A ball moves on the board as a result of card play by the players (who team up when more than two play).  Kick off, free kicks, penalty kicks, goalkeepers, corner kicks, clearing kicks --it's all in there in a neat, fast-playing package.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to score the most number of goals at the end of the game. It plays with cards that allow players to kick the ball and score goals. The game is played in two periods. The first period ends when there are 3 or less cards remaining in the card stack. (same thing for the second period).<br/>Cards can be played in several situation due to severals indications on them.<br/><br/>    Attack cards: played for the initial kick and during the game.<br/>    Free kick cards that you can play all time (exept to beging a game), and you can play an Attack card after this one.<br/>    Stop cards: To stop goals<br/>    Corner cards: to avoid goal and make the opponent kick a corner.<br/>    One penalty card.<br/><br/><br/>According to Lagoon Games this is believed to have been originally produced as &quot;Goal!&quot; in England in the 1950s, and their version is an authentic reproduction of the game<br/><br/>",

SPI seeing the popularity of Metagaming's Microgames started publishing small format science fiction and fantasy games in the late 1970's and early 1980's.  From the rulebook<br/><br/>&quot;Streaming through the mysterious stargates, the power-hungry Virunian forces have wracked the Milky Way for nearly 80 years in the War of Purification.  Remnants of the civilizations devastated by the Virunian Tri-Ships, banded together in a determined coalition, awaited the moment to launch their counter-stroke.  In 2519 AD, the moment had arrived: the Virunians encounter their nemesis and, retreating headlong to the source of their power, find themselves dispersed and without their potent unified command.  Coalition telepaths, sensing the Virunian confusion, direct their forces to the Nullgate, arriving just as the first helpless Virunian vessels tumble forth from the stargates.  The battle to ensue will decide the Virunian fate in the galaxy.  StarGate re-creates this climatic battle using a stylized, semi-abstract system of movement that allows combatants to conceal themselves from one another in the various planes and dimensions created by the Nullgate.  Players use cardboard playing pieces, representing units of the Virunian and Coalition forces, to maneuver and engage in combat.  Simple probability charts reveal the outcome of combat and various game functions.&quot;<br/><br/>",

The pegs are hit points, the last peg is a flag which when removed is worth victory points and indicates the units destruction.<br/><br/>If you want - instead of moving a military piece, you can advance your supply wagon.

        "description": "Raid sur Bruneval 1942 - Raid on Bruneval 1942 - (Operation Biting) is a solitary tactical game that appeared in the French  Vae Victis magazine #104 (special game edition). It simulates the Raid of British paratroopers under Major Frost's command to capture a german radar near Bruneval (northwestern France) during the night of february 27th 1942. During this operation, the british dropped by parachute must capture the radar, one or two german operators, destroy the manor and finally embark all in the waiting Landing Craft Assaults.<br/><br/>The game is edited under ziplock and contains a A3-size map depicting Bruneval surroundings at night (scale at 1/25000), 108 counters (the 3 formation of British paratroopers Drake, Nelson and Rodney ; german coastal defense, luftwaffe guards, MGs, pill-boxes and part of 685th infantry regiment reinforcements ; activation and other markers). One typical counter unit represents around 10 men. The rules are included in a separate 15 pages A5-sized booklet.<br/><br/>The duration of the game is 13 turns from 0:15 et 03:15 am. The player plays the British side first each turn and then the activated german units fight, move and get reinforcements in this respective order. Except for the coastal defenses, the german units are not represented on the map at the beginning. Instead, several randomly selected activation markers are deployed in specific areas of the map. The combination of proximity to British units and alert level may trigger an activation marker that may hide from 0 to 4 german units. These activated units may then fight and move. German move is dictated by closest (in PM) and largest enemy stack or German stack. Combat is resolved by comparing the strength of both adjacent stacks modified by the presence of an officer, the terrain modifier and 1D6. Largest score inflicts one step loss to the other.<br/>The British must score at least 10 victory points to get a marginal victory. More than 20 is a decisive victory. The historical score is 24 VP.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Over one hundred years ago, L. Frank Baum introduced the world to the wondrous Land of Oz. Now, experience these familiar characters, fantastic locations, and disturbing creatures as never before imagined.<br/><br/>The Card Game of Oz introduces an innovative new game system called the Storyline Game System&trade; that adds strategy to your challenging and fun adventures through Oz. Each player takes on the role of an author attempting to construct the best story in the world of Oz. During the game, players will attempt to bring together objects, characters and locations that are appropriate together &ndash; for example, the Tin Woodman and his Oil Can &ndash; while avoiding hazards like the field of poppies and terrible beasts and villains like the Kalidahs or the Wicked Witch of the West.<br/><br/>Each round players roll a special set of dice to determine the number of points they have for drawing and playing cards. The number of dice increases during the game, allowing the game to scale naturally while you play. The game ends when a player is able to move a Prime character &ndash; that is, one of the main characters of the story &ndash; from her Title card all the way to The End, but doing so is no simple race because the character who triggers the endgame is worth no points toward victory.<br/><br/>Featuring hundreds of fascinating characters, events, and vistas, Oz is a world that has stood the test of time. Construct an iconic tale that is all your own!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As the Avalanche Press website explains, Red Russia uses a similar system to Soldier Kings: The Seven Years War Worldwide in simulating the Russian Civil War. Players represent up to four factions: the Reds (Communists), Siberian Whites (monarchists), Southern Whites, or Northern Whites. Each turn represents three months, and the game begins in Summer of 1918 and concludes, should one player not win outright, in the Spring 1921 turn. This 3-4 hour game thus lasts a maximum of twelve turns.<br/><br/>Players command infantry and cavalry armies, and for some factions fleets and aircraft. Leaders assist these units in movement and combat over land areas and sea zones. Each land area is rated for the amount of money and manpower it generates each turn. Manpower represents not just fresh recruits for armies, but also the things made with human labor: food, uniforms, weapons and so on. Factions thus use manpower to rebuild forces, and money to finance their actions. Combat is conducted by rolling dice, one for each attack factor, with hits reducing them in strength or eliminating them outright. A good general lets you roll more dice. Each area is also rated for its garrison strength; to capture it, you have to defeat the garrison troops through siege (in addition to driving off any enemy armies there).<br/><br/>Finally, to keep the game from becoming too &quot;Risk&quot;-like, players can play various event cards.  Having the ability to fight through adversity makes one a powerful adversary in Red Russia.<br/><br/>",

The player must draw a challenge card from the pile and place it face up in the middle of the table. The player who draws the card decides which person or object will be the subject of the challenge. The player can&rsquo;t decide to measure themselves. The player announces if this round is played in centimeters or millimeters. If the drawn challenge card cannot be played (for example, none of the players has a tattoo), treat this card as a freestyle card.<br/><br/>Next all players &mdash; including the one who drew the card or chose the part to measure &mdash; secretly estimate the measurement. The players choose one of their number cards and play it face down on the table. The players can also answer by playing 2 number cards and their values are added together.<br/>Example: 17 + 30 = 47<br/><br/>Once all players have played a number card face down, the cards can be revealed.<br/>The initial player measures the body part or object. The player who guessed the number closest to the real size or length wins the challenge card.<br/><br/>Example: the correct answer is 35. If one player answered 38 and one player answered 30, the player with the 38 wins this turn.<br/><br/>ENDING TURNS:<br/>The used number cards are discarded in a pile and all players refill their hands so they have 10 cards. The players draw 1 number card if they played 1 number card, or they draw 2 number cards if they played 2 number cards. If the draw pile is empty, shuffle the discard pile and create a new draw pile.<br/><br/>The game continues clockwise (the player to the left of the first player draws the next challenge card, and so on).<br/><br/>VICTORY:<br/>The first player to collect 5 challenge cards wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>The concept of Size Up is simple: Estimate the length of your grandmother's little finger, the width of your train ticket, or the circumference of a carrot.

Games feature a period of economic build-up, preparation for combat, then Raiding and end-game. Players will align with one of four unique Fate Decks, boosting replay value and interaction. Craftiness, table politics and strategic play determine the winner. <br/> Overview:<br/>Players take on the role of an aspiring deity. They must build up a Temple, gather Faithful followers and collect powerful Relics in an attempt to wipe their opponents off the map &ndash; only one deity can reign eternal in this free-for-all of legendary proportions!<br/><br/>Play Time: <br/>2 players (1-hour), 3 players (1.5 hours), 4 players (2-2.5 hours)<br/><br/>Basic Play: <br/><br/>    Play follows a 4-step turn: Reveal (start), Marketplace (buy), Raid (combat), Reinforce (end). <br/>    The Tile Deck, Faithful Deck and Relic Deck feed into a central board called the Marketplace. <br/>    Players use Faithful (human followers) in their Temple to collect gold and defend in combat. <br/>    Faithful placed in the Raiding Party can attack opposing Temples during combat. <br/>    Relics (4 of which are aligned to each Fate) further increase strategic play and add variety. <br/>    Players will purchase Tiles from a randomized stack (the Tile Deck) to customize their Temple, which is then arranged strategically to increase hand-size and defenses. <br/>    The four fates are: Chaos, Grace, Prosperity and Wisdom, each tailored to a unique play-style. <br/>    Each Fate Deck has a powerful set of 20 different cards, in theme with each of the Fates. <br/><br/><br/>Combat: <br/>A Raiding Party ventures into an opposing Temple, encountering Defenders and Traps along a Tile path  to the Heart of the Temple, where the opposing life force dwells. Combat is resolved through dice rolls, with Defense rolling first and combining its total. Faithful played from the Raiding Party must beat defending total or they are forced to retreat. If the Temple is conquered, damage is dealt through Smiting. When an opponent&rsquo;s life hits zero (20 max), they are defeated. The last remaining player has achieved immortality!<br/><br/>",

You can produce them by yourself (maybe by using different facilities borrowed from Thomas Glover himself), or you can get them by negotiation with other player.

        "description": "Overview<br/><br/>Masters of the Gridiron combines the simplicity and strategy of a 15-minute head-to-head card game with the depth and detail of a pro football simulation. Years of development have yielded a realistic football simulation that combines simple and elegant rules with unlimited depth and strategy. By focusing on one key play in each scoring drive, you play an entire football game in under 15 minutes. Every player, from your star quarterback to your under-appreciated right tackle, has their own player card; and each player has the ability to impact the result of every game.<br/><br/>Masters of the Gridiron can be played by anyone; even those who are new to the game of football. Intuitive rules mixed with tense competition gives this game an addictive edge you won't find in any other sports game.<br/><br/>History<br/><br/>Clay Dreslough, the game's lead designer, wrote his first dice-based sports simulation in 1976. He later discovered similar games from companies like Strat-O-Matic and Sports Illustrated, but he didn't enjoy them very much. It's tedious to spend several hours picking plays, flipping them over, rolling dice, looking up the results on a chart, rolling more dice, moving counters on the &quot;play clock&quot; and so on, just to resolve each play.<br/><br/>Instead, Clay created the award-winning Baseball Mogul and Football Mogul computer games, capable of simulating entire seasons in just a few minutes. We used this technology as the under-pinnings for Masters of the Gridiron -- to create realistic player ratings for over 680 current players, and to create realistic playbooks for all 32 teams.<br/><br/>Over the last four years, we have boiled down 26 pages of rules to the bare essentials, creating a head-to-head card game that feels like football.<br/><br/>Setup<br/><br/>You choose your starting offensive and defensive players, and combine them with a playbook of 24 (or more) cards. You can pair an MVP quarterback with 3 superstar receivers, or focus on your offensive line and the running game. Choose a standard 4-3 defense, or add a nickel back to help stop a team built around the passing game.<br/><br/>Masters of the Gridiron encourages you to create your own customized deck, combining your favorite players and plays from multiple decks. Three simple rules govern the creation of your own customized team roster and playbook. This gives your freedom to build your offense around a power running game or a vertical passing game, and tailor your defense to pressure opposing quarterbacks or focus on forcing turnovers (to name just a few examples). Assemble an offensive juggernaut and try it out against your friend's shutdown defense -- the possibilities are limitless!<br/><br/>Game Play<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with 3 offensive player cards, 3 defensive player cards, and 4 playbook cards. To mount a scoring drive, you match a playbook card to an offensive player with the appropriate skills (such as &quot;passing&quot; or &quot;run blocking&quot;) and lay them down on the table, announcing the player rating that your opponent needs to beat in order to stop your attempt to score. Their ability to stop you depends on a combination of their strategy decisions and the luck of the draw.<br/><br/>Players alternate possessions until &quot;time runs out&quot; (when each team has no more offensive player cards to draw). Along the way, you enjoy all the aspects of a real football game, from goal-line stands and two-point conversions to game-changing interceptions and last-minute field goals.<br/><br/>The playbook cards themselves are used to track your score. So the only thing you need to play are two decks (one per team) and 15 minutes of time.<br/><br/>Contents<br/><br/>Each deck contains 54 high-quality full-color playing cards:<br/><br/>13 Offensive Player cards<br/>13 Defensive Player cards<br/>24 Offensive Playbook cards<br/>4 Defensive Playbook cards<br/>Each team includes their own printed card box for safekeeping. Our cards are also compatible with other card-storage boxes and sleeves, such as those used for collectible card games like Magic: The Gathering and Pokemon.<br/><br/>Licensing<br/><br/>Please note that Masters of the Gridiron is not licensed by the National Football League. Our games use real player names and stats, but do not include registered trademarks (such as team logos).

However, among your crew are machines and cyborgs disguised as humans with their own goals in mind. Achieve your goal of repairing or destroying the space-time continuum before fuel runs out!<br/><br/>-Story-<br/><br/>Immediately following humans' discovery of time travel, the space-time continuum began to fall apart along with the rest of civilization. You are all aboard the last time machine, but you are a mixed crew. Most of you are humans, set on repairing the damage your meddling has caused. However, two other races have disguised themselves as humans to sneak aboard your ship to accomplish their own sinister goals. The machines from the horrific future are bent on chaos to preserve their existence. The cyborgs from the near future, half-human half-machine, play both sides of order and chaos to achieve their own goals.<br/><br/>Since the time machine was invented by humans, it is unsurprisingly experiencing technical difficulties- notably the main controls. Landing in one of six eras, the crew needs to democratically decide which members are best equipped to repair spacetime by returning beings to their appropriate eras, or create a chain reaction of paradoxes to sow more chaos through time!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Since foreign presences are essentially mutually exclusive, a lot of shouldering aside goes on. Control of non-player states scores points, as well as consumer goods factories. Military bases don't score anything, but they protect your influence over another country.<br/><br/>The players accumulate chips representing their overall power on the military, industrial or political spheres, and use those chips to exert pressure on other players. For example, you can &quot;demand&quot; that a player withdraw his steel mills from a country you consider to be &quot;yours&quot; by paying a chip (of any colour). The other player either complies or counters with a chip of his own. This can escalate until either player buckles. Escalate too much and you leave yourself open to &quot;attack&quot; by other players later on.<br/><br/>Random events complicate matters. Alliances can be precious, but only one player will win...The game takes its name from the Summit events, which are scoring rounds.<br/><br/>",

The game includes 12 surfer dude cards, 12 robot dude cards, 12 pirate dude cards, 12 ghost dude cards, 12 pizza box dude cards, and 12 cowboy dude cards.<br/><br/>Your goal is to quickly find matches for as many of your cards as you can. To play, you say the word &quot;dude&quot; as you think the character on your card would say the word &quot;dude&quot;. At the same time, listen to how the other players are saying the word &quot;dude&quot;. Trying to figure out whether you have the same character as another player is the essence of more dude.<br/><br/>",

You secretly pick three of the racing goblins and you get points based on where they finish. You manipulate their movement, so you have some control over where they finish. Just don't be first.

No one seems to know what happened to them!  The Gangs, Thugs, Minions, and Villains of New Dover immediately noticed the power vacuum in the city and began to assert themselves.  The city is reeling from their attacks!  What can be done?<br/><br/>The Sidekicks of the Super Heroes haven't given up the fight!  They know they aren't as powerful as the Bad Guys, but they are courageous and resourceful.  They know where the Heroes have helpful technologies, weapons, and devices.  To help each other out, the Sidekicks have set-up supply lines between themselves to share useful things! They will protect New Dover!  And maybe along the way, they can find out what happened to the Super Heroes...<br/><br/>This is their story: this is The Sidekick Saga.<br/><br/>Sidekick Saga is a cooperative adventure, combat, and exploration game for 1-4  players (ages 13 and up). It takes 60-90 minutes for one game.  There is also an ongoing story to find the missing Super Heroes!<br/><br/>For 2--4 players, each player takes control of one of the Sidekick characters in the game. A solo player will take control of two Sidekick characters and will play them both as if it were a 2-Player game.<br/><br/>The players work together to defeat the current Villain and their Villain Forces.  This is a cooperative game: the Sidekicks win or lose together! There is only one way to win (usually): the players must defeat the main Villain by reducing him to 0 Hit Points!   There are many ways to lose!<br/><br/>If all Sidekicks are defeated (reduced to 0 Hit Points), the Villain wins! Note: only 1 Sidekick needs to survive for the Sidekicks to win! Sometimes, other Sidekicks will take one for the team to defeat the Villain!<br/><br/>If time runs out, the Villain has stalled long enough to bring his evil scheme to fruition, and he wins!  This happens if the Villain is still alive at the End of Act III (when the last Bad News card comes out).<br/><br/>If the City Terror ever gets too high (16 on the City Terror track), the Sidekicks lose!<br/><br/>Sidekick Saga is a light legacy game of exploration (moving around the city), &quot;drafting&quot; (sharing cards cooperatively), variable player powers (each Sidekick has different powers) and hand management (playing cards appropriately), and combat (fighting bad guys).  Players move around the city looking for weapons, ideas, leads, anything to help them take out the Bad Guys!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

For example a picture of a snowflake and a picture of an eye can make &quot;cold stare&quot;. Once time is up, each player compares their list, only scoring a point for the word/phrase no-one else has written. In &quot;fast play&quot;, all players shout out the word/phrase, the quicker player removing the pair of dice from the box. Once all the dice are removed or no-one can make an acceptable word, each player scores a point for each pair of dice. After several rounds, first player to 20 points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

The only escape is through some old feed holes filled up by the wind with drifting dust and litter. But there are still some remnants of the things they once hoarded there, such as acorns and berries and other stuff that might come in useful.<br/><br/>Underground Panic is a semi-cooperative game. Players join forces to rescue all the gophers by leading them through the tunnels before the water floods their dwelling, trying to gather as many foodstuff as possible during the flight. They can move any of the gophers in their turn, and collect items in their own cheek-poaches. The game ends when all the gophers have escaped from the burrow. Players are rewarded for speed, but the game is continued until there are any gophers under the ground. The player who collects the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>J&ouml;n a v&iacute;z! Menek&uuml;lni kell!

In the serpentine canyons of the gorges and under cover of shady pinewoods, sly outlaws are lurking for the purpose of urging moneyed noblemen, together with their irritated courtesans, out of their well-cushioned travel coaches in order to re-distribute their possessions.<br/>Therefore, experienced aristocrats take long detours and hire expensive escorts in order to avoid the daylight robbers.<br/>But the eloquent bandits are no fools. They besiege the byways also, and so, from behind inconspicuous curves, the thanks of the light-fingered crooks might be heard unexpectedly as they call out, &quot;Millie Grazie.&quot;<br/><br/>The players are alternately noblemen and robbers. Whereas the noblemen want to head from town to town without being waylaid, the robbers lurk on the side of the road to prey on them.<br/>A nobleman tries to fulfil task cards, that can be found in one town and shall be brought into another town. Before he moves his pawn 4 or 5 streets from town to town, each other robber (the other players) decide on their &lsquo;ambush compass&lsquo; one street on which they lurk. If the nobleman uses a road on which robbers are lurking, the nobleman is waylaid and robbed. A robber who is successful gets victory points. The nobleman robbed loses a number of task cards (if he has bad luck it's just the task one step away of fulfilling).<br/>If a nobleman reaches a town with a task card he should bring to that town, he gains the victory points printed on the task card.<br/>Before moving at all, but after the robbers decided secretly the street they are lurking, the nobleman has the choice to hire a guard for exactly one street on his way. On that street he is safe and cannot be robbed, though he can only move 4 streets, not 5 as he is allowed without guard.<br/>The first to reach 30 victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ex illis is a miniature wargame set in a pseudo-historic fantasy world populated by the historic figures from the 13th century, while also incorporating mythological and biblical figures from medieval Europe. Angels, demons, witches, faeries and imps fight alongside different human factions for the dominance over Europe &mdash; or to strengthen the evil grip of the Infernal army.<br/><br/>The first edition of Ex illis, released in 2009, featured high-quality plastic miniatures with which players would pit armies of 60 to 100 warriors against one another in epic combat, but instead of using traditional wargame components such as dice and rulers to resolve battles, the game instead used software for an iPod touch, Mac, PC or laptop, allowing the publisher to embed rules in the software instead of requiring players to consult or memorize rulebooks.<br/><br/>The second edition of Ex illis, scheduled for publication in 2014, does away with the software to allow players to compete wherever they like, while also being compatible with the components and figures of the game's first edition.<br/><br/>",

The winner will be the player who collects the most gold at the end of the game.<br/><br/>To play, each player selects a Character (Rogue, Priest, Mage, and Fighter). All Characters have their own special ability, weapons, armor and item cards. Players will build a 30-card deck, also called the Energy Deck, with these cards.  The deck will be used to power abilities, do damage to monster and will also be used to gain additional treasure, in the form of gold cards, or items and abilities to put into active play.<br/><br/>Players then take turns using their abilities and weapons to cause damage and collect experience points from monsters.  Players will use their energy deck throughout the game, but if they spend too much energy, they might not have enough to survive the final boss. Can your party work together and survive the dungeon or feel the agony of defeat. In the end there can be only one winner and that is the player with the most gold.<br/><br/>",

Through the establishment of trade routes and the paying of tributes, players grow rich, as they are emboldened to fight to protect their monopolies or expand their influence.

        "description": "The universe is so vast and the stars hide so many things that the birth of a new planet often goes unnoticed. But this time you will be able to make the difference, your planet is the most beautiful, the most welcoming of all the galaxy and you intend to prove it well!<br/>Attract a maximum of life forms on your planet and, by respecting the laws of gravity, make sure to arrange your living spaces as well as possible in order to score a maximum of Prestige points. Show everyone that your planet is the most prosperous in the entire galaxy!<br/><br/>Planetopia is a space deck building game where players each embody a planet and will optimize their hand to achieve the most interesting combinations to win the game.<br/><br/>The game goes clockwise,each player taking one turn at a time. During his turn a player has the choice among the following actions:<br/><br/>Mandatory action to choose among:<br/><br/>     Take a Cosmos card: Take a Cosmos card from the common trail. The rightmost card is considered to be closest to your planet, so you can take it without spending an Atom token. On the other hand, if you choose to take a card farther away from your planet, you will have to spend an Atom token on each card to the right of the chosen card. The chosen card then joins your hand, you can only apply its effect once you play it. Once the card is taken, slide the remaining cards to the right to fill the empty space. Then draw a new Cosmos card and add it to the left end of the row so you have 5 cards available again.<br/>     Play a card: Play a card of your hand face up in front of you and apply its effect. Most of the time the Cosmos cards can accommodate new residents on your planet, then take the Alien tokens corresponding to the icons on the card played and place them on your game board. If you end up with more Alien tokens than your board can welcome, discard the token(s) of your choice without obtaining Atom token(s) in exchange. If you play the last card you had in hand, recover all your cards at the end of your turn.<br/>     Recover cards: Collect in your hand all the cards played face up in front of you.<br/><br/><br/>On top of your mandatory action you can make another optional action to choose between:<br/><br/>     Atomize: You may decide to discard one or two of the residents of your choice from your planet, receive an Atom token for each discarded Alien token.<br/>     Make a combo: Discard the Alien tokens corresponding to the pattern on the Prestige card and take it. Keep it face up in front of you. Some cards can also recover special tokens.<br/><br/><br/>You can therefore do a maximum of two actions per turn: one mandatory and one optional, in the order of your choice.<br/><br/>The game is played in as many rounds as necessary for a player to score 25 Prestige points. The player with the most points is then declared the winner, her Planet is the most remarkable of all the Galaxy!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They then challenge the Israelis, using not only conventional military forces, but also the full spectrum of conflict, including insurgency and terrorism. The game includes several possible scenario options for different types of conflict. Holy Land game shows some of the major factors involved. The Holy Land game system is based upon Decision: Iraq; there are two players in Holy Land, various Arab powers and foreign fighters, the latter possibly including Al Qaeda and Iranian support, among others, and the Israelis, with possible coalition support.<br/> Both players have a set of pieces that represent both conventional and unconventional forces. Players move their pieces across the spaces on the map and engage in various kinds of conflict in order to destroy enemy forces, seize critical objectives, and change the Netwar Index, which is an index used to indicate how successful each side has been in meeting their goals. Furthermore, one unique feature of the Holy Land is that as units engage in combat, their effectiveness may increase or decrease as they gain experience in fighting, or become demoralized.<br/> The game map shows Israel and adjoining countries, divided into large rectangular boxes known as regions, representing the general geography of the area. Players deploy their units into region boxes, into the &ldquo;Open&rdquo; area. Each region box<br/> The game includes two maps (22x34&rdquo;) and 352 counters.<br/><br/>",

This game is about matching cards to create combinations (straight, flush, pair, three of a kind, four of a kind) to attract the attention of the teachers and get a lot of magical items.<br/><br/>The cards are from 1 to 13 in 5 colors. The cards are dual (2 different numbers and colors on a card) and you can use the orientation of your choice in order to form combinations. Each teacher is tied to a combination. At your turn you have to play one mandatory action : play cards (straight, flush&hellip;) or draw. You can also play a bonus action : put an item back to the general supply to draw one card.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn you get one magical item for each teacher in front of you.<br/><br/>You play turn after turn until one of two events occurs :<br/><br/>1/ you empty 3 stacks of magical items, you count points of the magical items and the higher score gets to level up your coven.<br/><br/>2/ you get one item of each type, no matter the points of the items, you level up your coven.<br/><br/>The first player to level up twice his coven wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The next player must then shake the Whirlpool and follow the results:<br/>1) Draw H2O - draw until they get a blue, 2, 0 or wild card.<br/>2) Wave Right - show a card to the player on the right.<br/>3) Wave Left - show a card to the player on the left.<br/>4) Wipeout - reverse order of play (player who started the Splash must use the whirlpool)<br/><br/>Other possible Whirlpool results are draw, discard and give cards.<br/><br/>The cards and Whirlpool are contained in a sturdy plastic box, with a slide on/off lid.<br/><br/>",

This one player is Wilson, the mischievous little wolf who likes to hide in the flock of sheep. Everyone else works together as Shep the sheepdog to find the little wolf's hiding place.<br/><br/>To set up for the round, lay out the sixteen sheep tiles. While all other players close their eyes, Wilson then swaps the wolf token for one of the sheep. The Shep players then place the sheepdog token on a tile and reveal it. If they already found Wilson, they win the round, but if not the Wilson player chooses two tiles adjacent either orthogonally or diagonally (whether Wilson is on one of those tiles or not) and swaps them. Shep then moves to any adjacent tile and reveals it.<br/><br/>If Wilson is still in hiding after eight tiles have been revealed, the Wilson player wins the round and receives reward tokens; otherwise the Shep players receive rewards. After each player has been Wilson once, whoever has the most rewards wins!<br/><br/>",

The game has been copied by many companies since and is the most widely available of all 3D Chess boards.<br/><br/>The most famous variant of 3D Chess appeared in the Star Trek television show in 1966, in which it was referred to as 'Three Dimensional Chess'.<br/>The original stage property was designed by Irving A Feinberg and consisted of three 4x4 boards and four movable 2x2 boards.<br/>It was developed into a real game by the technical designer Franz Joseph Schnaubelt in his 1975 book, the Star Fleet Technical Manual and improved by a fan and chess player Andrew Bartmess, whose rules are some of the most popular.<br/>Fans of Star Trek still call it 'Three Dimensional Chess' but players of the game call it by the title Schnaubelt popularised 'Tri Dimensional Chess'.<br/><br/>In 1985, the game design Gary Gygax published rules for Dragon Chess in Dragon magazine.<br/>A Dragon Chess board is three 8x12 boards stacked up and includes the extra pieces: Sylph, Griffon, Dragon, Warrior, Oliphant, Unicorn, Hero, Thief, Cleric, Mage, Paladin, Dwarf, Basilisk and Elemental.<br/><br/>Max Chappell started designing Hyperchess in the early '70s but didn't produce and sell the first commercial set until 1996.<br/>Although it was influenced by the tri dimensional chess board, it has been described as more helical in design.<br/><br/>In 2001 William d'Agostino recreated the Strato Chess board and called it Millenium Chess, with the idea of extending Classic Chess, whithout distorting the game.<br/><br/>",

Every chef gathers ingredients from the Protein, Vegetable, and Flavor decks and, after the judge reveals the challenge, they choose which ones to get rid of and which ones to keep. Then, before the chefs can share their creation, the judge unveils the Secret Ingredient that must be incorporated in some way into each dish. After hearing what each chef has prepared, the judge will determine who wins each round.

        "description": "This is a game of land development and litigation.  Each player is assigned an area of the board, containing three land sections and building lots of different colours (red, yellow, orange or blue).  The object of the game is to be the first to build all of your nine buildings.<br/><br/>On your turn, you gamble for income.  The income die is rolled; if it comes up on its red dot face, you don't get any money.  Otherwise, you get the amount indicated and may roll again --but if you roll the red dot, you lose any income for the turn!  Income is doubled once you've completed all three buildings of one of your land sections, tripled once you've completed two sections.<br/><br/>Next, you draw an Opportunity card and resolve it.  You may buy a Town Meeting card; these cards are either Legal Action or Defence cards (this is kept secret until used).  Finally, you may improve a property (from its undeveloped state), or build a resort on it (once improved) --if you have the money.  The properties have varying degrees of risk associated with them (the Opportunity cards) and consequently varying building costs.<br/><br/>When you complete a building, the other players may play Legal Action cards (up to five), each of which places a red marble in the gavel device.  You automatically get a green marble, and may add up to four more by using your Defence cards.  The gavel is then shaken and then held up so marbles roll into the handle; a window at the handle's end reveals who won.  If the opponents win, the builder does not get his building (and has lost the money) and the opponents get money from the bank for their trouble.<br/><br/>",

Contained within these mystic Tomes is said to be the arcane secrets of life, power, and the very forces of nature. It is said that whoever finds these Tomes, can control magic itself.<br/><br/>Classic trick taking action, with a magical twist! Tome is a fresh take on the age old genre. In the normal mode, 4 players are split into 2 teams where teammates sit across from one another. Teams compete for points each chapter (trick) by playing 1 spell (card) to see who can win victory for their team. 3-4 Players can also square off against one another in survival mode, to see who is tough enough to be the last one standing.<br/><br/>Trump is not stagnate each round, but constantly changing each chapter. After each player is dealt 6 spells, the remaining spells are set in the center to form the Element Deck. Each chapter, a Title Spell is revealed from the top of the Element deck. The Element of the Title Spell determines what Element is trump for that chapter.<br/><br/>Each spell has a unique effect that can be used to shift the game in your favor. Weakening your opponents spells, powering up your own, or even changing trump! In order to gain the true power of a spell rules must be followed. Following suit is not required in Tome, a player can play any spell from their hand on their turn. When the lead player plays a spell, they begin a Chain in that Element. The next player can play a spell of the same Element to continue the chain and gain the effect of their spell. If a player plays a spell with a different Element, the Chain is broken and their spell is silenced and has no effect.<br/><br/>Within the Tome deck there are also spells of a Special Element. These spells all share a similar property. They do not start nor break a Chain, and their magic cannot be silenced. However there is a trade off: A special spell cannot be trump.<br/><br/>In survival mode, each player is on their own. Players begin a round with 2 health, then the player who plays the weakest spell each chapter loses a health. When a players health reaches 0, they are out of the round and each surviving player score a point.<br/><br/>Tome is built to be a modular game. Switching in different Elements changes up the strategy and will ensure that each game is fresh and exciting!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

On a turn, you or another player roll the four six-sided dice, then each player uses the results to create two two-digit numbers, writing each number into an empty city. If you write a double-digit number (11, 22, etc.), then mark off a bonus box; if you fill, say, a blue city with a two-digit number that used the blue die for one of the digits, mark off a bonus box.<br/><br/>You can write each two-digit combination (11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 22, etc.) only once, marking them off on the bottom of the sheet as the turns pass. If you can't mark off one or two cities based on the die results, then you must place an X through one or two cities. You have two special powers you can use once each game: re-rolling 1-4 dice when you're the active roller, and re-using a digit on one die in each of the two-digit numbers you create that turn.<br/><br/>After thirteen turns, the game ends. You score 1 point for each marked bonus box and -1 point for each X. If you have four or more cities in consecutive order, e.g., 15, 16, 21, 22, 23, then you score 2-9 points based on the length of the chain. You also identify your longest chain of non-X cities that are in increasing order and score 1 point for each city. Finally, you score 0-9 points based on how many of the three zones have no Xed cities. Whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

This is an Operational level board-wargame of intermediate complexity in which the two players command forces of Germany and Czechoslovakia. The German player must conquer Czechoslovakia within a certain period of time. The Czech player must prevent this from happening.<br/><br/>&quot;What if Czechoslovakia has not succumbed to Anglo-French pressure at the conference table at Munich, and decided to call Germany's bluff over the Sudetenland on the battlefield? With the possible exception of Adolf Hitler, no one wanted war at the time, least of all the Czech people. But they were ready, willing and able to fight if the French and the British showed the slightest inclination to support them against the Fuhrer's ill-prepared Third Reich. The resulting war would have been a hard fought affair, especially if German fears of a second front to the West had materialized.&quot;<br/><br/>Published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #152 - Jun 1992.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1-2 days<br/>Hex: 7.5 miles / 12 kilometers<br/>Units: Company to Battalion<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; six color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page Case Green booklet<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-Low<br/>Players: 2<br/>Playing Time: 2-8<br/><br/>",

        "description": "World at War magazine Issue 13<br/><br/>From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Guards Tank: The Battle of Prochorovka, July 1943 (GT), designed by Joseph Miranda, is the first of our new East Front Battles Series. That series will present operational simulations of medium-to-large-sized battles fought during World War II on that front. There will be two players in each game, and solitaire play is easily doable.<br/>  There are two general types of units in the counter-mix: maneuver (non-artillery) and artillery. In addition, certain units are classed as &ldquo;armored.&rdquo; Individual units vary in organizational size from platoons to regiments.<br/>   The action in GT is focused on the Kursk offensive&rsquo;s southern front, as the SS Panzer Corps breaks through the Soviet main line of resistance, held by elements of 6th Guards Army. The German spearheads are then met by a counterattack from 5th Guards Tank Army. What followed was one of the more controversial battles of World War II. There&rsquo;s still historical debate about its significance. Some historians claim German tank losses here made it the turning point of the war in the east. Others say German losses were exaggerated; it was the Red Army that suffered massively, and the Germans actually called off the offensive for strategic reasons. Here is your chance to explore those interpretations.<br/>  Each hex in GT represents one kilometer (0.62 miles) from side to opposite side. Each game turn represents a day. There&rsquo;s a nine-turn short scenario and a 13-turn long scenario. The rules weigh in at a little under 14,000 words. Two experienced players can complete the short scenario in about four hours. Rules cover such items as: reinforcements, replacements, command-control, zones of control, adjacent and ranged combat, first and second wave combat, suppression, anti-tank fire, airpower, weather, fog of war, supply, untried units, and special tactics.<br/><br/>Originally published in World at War magazine #13 (Aug-Sep 2010).<br/><br/>",

That era saw the Ottomans go from a small nation competing for survival in the Near East to a regional superpower, forming a state that lasted until the end of the First World War. To build their empire, the Ottomans conquered the remnant of the Byzantine Empire, won smashing victories over other Islamic states and twice pushed to the gates of Vienna.<br/><br/>There are four factions in the game, each represented by a color: the Turks (Ottomans and others), the Holy League (mainly Catholic Europeans), the Orthodox (eastern Christians), and the Caliphate (a general term for the more established Islamic states). Within each faction there are individual nations. For example, the Turks include the Ottomans and the Seljuks.   Each player controls a &ldquo;core nationality&rdquo;; that is, one nationality within a faction of which he may never lose control. In the course of the game players may gain control of additional nationalities, some of which may be inimical to each other.<br/><br/>Ottomans is played in a series of turns. Within each game turn, players pick stratagem markers (which allow players to take certain political and military actions), move their forces and engage in combat. A player, while representing an individual faction, may control forces from other factions. Players will find themselves sometimes attacking forces they control, while perhaps temporarily aligning themselves with an opponent, in order to reach their final goals. Throughout each game turn, players may use stratagem markers to gain military and political advantages as well as to undermine their foes. Players receive reinforcements depending on which regions they control.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to build the strongest empire. At the end of the game, players check to see which faction won the game. The player who contributed the most to that faction&rsquo;s victory wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Horse Fair is a card game containing 65 cards (numbered 3-7) and 10 horse figurines.  As the judges of the Horse Fair, players vote on which of the five horses they want to win the fair.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player lays a card from their hand face-up to the table and draws a new card from the draw pile. A horse is a winner when the number of face-up cards for that horse, among all players, is equal to the number printed on that horse&rsquo;s cards. All players who played the winning horse collect those cards for later scoring.  The player that played the last scoring card also receives a horse figurine.  All other face-up cards are discarded and a new round begins. The game ends when one player has acquired 4 horse figurines.<br/><br/>Scoring for the basic game awards one point for each card and two points for each horse figurine a player has collected.  The advanced game scoring awards the face value of scored cards and only one point for each horse figurine.<br/><br/>The deck is balanced, containing more 7-value cards than 6-value, etc. Each horse also has a &ldquo;Second Look&rdquo; card which counts as two cards when laid to the table and a &ldquo;Thumbs Down&rdquo; card in which all cards for that are face-up for that horse are discarded.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Trendy<br/><br/><br/>",

Once you've collected every color and built your own perfect rainbow to victory, you're declared the winner. Doesn't sound too stressful? Well watch out, keeping hold of your colors isn't as easy as you might think. Grab the wrong color? Return one to the middle. Grab both wrong colors? Return two to the middle.

Years ago, scientists successfully constructed the Belief Engine, a machine that warps reality based on peoples&rsquo; strongly held beliefs. The machine was turned on for testing, but it proved too sensitive: widespread belief in the depravity of man and fears of social collapse suddenly took on the full force of objective fact, and science skepticism rendered the Engine&rsquo;s creators helpless to intervene. Without resort to a shared external reality, civilization crumbled like a sand castle in the tide.<br/><br/>&quot;From the ruins have now arisen cults led by charismatic, messianic figures possessed of seemingly divine powers derived from the still-functioning Engine. You are one such a figure&mdash;the true one, the Messiah. It is God&rsquo;s will that you build temples and marshal followers, then mold their beliefs to perform miracles and destroy your rivals. They&rsquo;ll be doing the same, but don&rsquo;t worry&ndash;God is on your side&hellip;&quot;<br/><br/>How it's played<br/><br/>Rounds go player by player, with each individual player turn broken up into phases:<br/><br/>1) Beginning (reset any praying followers to active status; recruit followers and build temples; draw back up to 6 cards);<br/>   2) Action (move units, have followers on temples pray to produce belief, use belief to perform miracles);<br/>   3) Combat (adjacent enemy units attack one another according to deterministic rules);<br/>   4) End (discard down to 3 cards, loot any empty enemy temple you have units left adjacent to, make sure you have enough units left to support the continued functioning of your own temples).<br/><br/>Each round ends with the Market, in which players make secret bids on an assortment of 5-7 miracle cards. Bidders get to spend their bid on up to 2 cards, with high bidders buying first. Purchased cards are placed into each player's discard pile, eventually to be cycled back into their decks Dominion-style.<br/><br/>A player wins by slaying an enemy messiah, by reducing an enemy to less than 4 followers, by capturing an enemy's holy city, or by reducing an enemy to less than 8 miracle cards.<br/><br/>",

They then reroll the die or dice that did not match the image on the card. As soon as a player obtains a match with their three dice with the beer, the snack and the coaster that appear on the card, they quickly grab it, show their match to the other players and collect the card. The winner flips over the next card, and the game continues.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has collected five cards.<br/><br/><br/>    Don&rsquo;t Drink and Drive. EVER.<br/><br/><br/>You can, however, Drink Responsibly and Play Brew Dice!<br/><br/>",

When you play, you have to make the appropriate animal sound. If you forget to make this sound, you get penalty cards. If you place down a red card you must not make any sound &ndash; except when you place down the red rooster, in which case you shout &quot;Cocotaki!&quot;<br/><br/>The first player who has no cards left wins. The game includes many additional rules for advanced play.<br/><br/>Kakadoo is an updated version of Cocotaki that incorporates a number of the optional rules from that earlier game. As a result, the minimum playing age has been raised from 5 to 8. Players now draw four penalty cards instead of two when they mess up, and whenever a lion is played, the player doesn't roar but says, &quot;Hello, your majesty&quot;. Play a donkey, and only donkeys can follow in the next round; play a cockatoo to skip the next player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When Dragons Fight is an operational level game on the hypothetical invasion of Taiwan by the Peoples Republic of China (PRC) circa 2003-2004. The simulation is based on the premise that the PRC opens with a massive missile attack and is able to use their economic and military leverage to keep America out of the conflict. With no foreign power intervening, the PRC must conquer the island within 15 days or the Republic of China (ROC) wins. The war itself is conventional and fast-paced.<br/><br/>The game is of low-to-intermediate complexity. The system covers a wide spectrum of modern operational warfare, including rules for amphibious landings, air mobility, and land and air combat. Victory is determined for the PRC by seizing a significant portion of the island's population centers, which would render Taiwan's continued existence as an independent country economically and strategically impossible. The Taiwanese win through denial of Communist Victory Points or the capture of the landing beaches.<br/><br/>Units portrayed are mainly brigades and divisions, ranging from about 5000-10,000 men, and some 50-250 armored fighting vehicles in the mechanized units. The game map covers the entire island of Formosa (also known as Taiwan) with terrain types limited to clear, beach, mountain, cities &amp; large towns, rivers and highways.<br/><br/>Originally published in Command magazine #54 (2001)<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/>hex scale = 11 km per hex side to side <br/>time = one day per game turn <br/>strength = regiment/brigade/division sized units<br/><br/>",

The other player, controlling James Bond, Tiger Tanaka, Kissy Suzuki, and their intrepid Ninja band, must make the perilous descent from high atop the base to foil the evil plan. Individual playing pieces, representing the major characters and their troops, battle across the multi-level floor of the base, engage in fire combat and hand-to-hand struggles as the moments until launch tick by.

Of course, you can try to take over the country first then build in there, using the force of countries you own and mercenaries you have or with those you can persuade allies to contribute.<br/><br/>The type of government a country is can also have an effect on what you buy (or what you keep!).

        "description": "The Suez Canal was essential to British strategic communications and trade in the Great War, as well as being an important political symbol. In August of 1916, the Ottoman Empire sent an expeditionary force, which included contingents of Germans and Austro-Hungarians, against the canal. While the British were expecting an attack, the Ottomans gained tactical surprise by attacking at night. If the Ottoman attack had succeeded, Britain&rsquo;s prestige and warmaking capacity would be severely damaged.<br/><br/>Suez 1916 uses the Fire &amp; Movement system. The movement and combat systems are designed around the realities of mechanized warfare, giving motorized and/or specially-trained units clear advantages. Players can augment units at the instant of combat with support fire, provided by weapons ranging from mortars through cannon and light ground attack aircraft to heavy bombers. A seemingly predictable assault can be overturned at the last minute by heavy defending fires, while even small units may develop tremendous offensive punch with the assistance of a heavy bombardment. Winning the battle is a matter of maneuver, firepower and asset management.<br/><br/>The historical battle was a touch-and-go affair, ending with the British pushing the Turks just far enough to keep the canal safe. The British have the stronger force, but the Central Powers has the advantages of surprise, initiative, and strong artillery support. The player who best utilizes his strengths and is prepared to capitalize on opportunities will prevail.<br/><br/>Details:<br/><br/>    Level: Regiment/Brigade<br/>    Hex: 0.6 miles (1 km) <br/><br/><br/>",

The HI-LO chip is in the center of the table showing one side of it. On a turn, you play a card from your hand onto the discard pile that is either higher or lower (depending on the HI-LO chip) than the current top card. If you can't play, then flip the chip. If it lands on the opposite side, play a card, then end your turn; if not, then draw a card, playing it immediately, if possible. If you still can't play, then whoever played most recently claims all of the cards in the discard pile, then you play whatever card you want.<br/><br/>If you play a card that ends with a 1, then the next player draws a card and skips their turn. If the card ends in a 2, then you must play again.<br/><br/>When someone runs out of cards, they collect the discard pile, then players tally their points for cards collected, with cards ending in 0 being worth 10 points and all other cards 1 point. The player who went out scores a bonus of 10 points. Complete multiple rounds until a player scores more than 75 points, with whoever has the highest score at that point winning the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Tiny Footprint, you play as a group of friends or a household trying to reach the climate target by reducing your carbon emissions down to two tonnes per person before time runs out. You start by determining where you live, which lifestyle you have and which character you play. All of these choices effect the game and all characters have unique capabilities.<br/><br/>The game board shows four emission tracks, housing, food, transport and consumption. And the aim of the players is to reduce each track to zero and thereby meeting the climate target and winning the game. A deck of mission gives the players their missions that they need work together on to reduce the emissions. The actions they are able to perform comes from three separate resource card decks; Finances, Discipline and Commitment. These resource cards act as a currency in the game and also provide different actions the players can take. The players use action pawns to take any of the three possible actions: Take a card, Take 3 cards for two action pawns or Play a card.<br/><br/>All players need to cooperate using their character&rsquo;s unique abilities and the actions provided by the resource cards. The household cannot rely one just one player to win the game for them but instead the household needs to collectively agree on their strategy and which actions they need to take to be able to complete the environmental missions and thereby reducing the emissions to zero and thereby they all win! If they don't manage to reduce them down to zero before the end of the 5th round time has run out and they all lost. Then they can try again in a new residence, with a different lifestyle and with different characters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Armed with a Spellbook and with the aid of the enchanted Element-Stones, the sorcerers summoned fantastic Creatures and magical Spells. A wizard who had no more pages left in his Spellbook would eventually have lost the magical battle of wits.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent&rsquo;s card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he or she puts the top card of his or her deck on his or her Discard Pile (or Archive). Is a player unable to draw a card, he or she loses immediately.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lord of the Chords is a classical music themed, card drafting set collection game for 2-4 players that has real music theory  cleverly woven into its game mechanics. Prepare for augmented fun, major geeky learning, and diminished boredom!<br/><br/>Players begin by choosing 1 of 13 musical instruments that grant variable player powers. To win the game, players must draft the right Note cards to their hands, according to the active Key Signature tile. Notes are then played to the field, and combined to form Chords. When a Chord that matches the current Key Signature is completed by a player, that Key Signature Tile is claimed! The first Player to collect 3 Key Signatures is the Bringer of Harmony, the Destroyer of Dissonance, the Lord of the Chords!<br/><br/>On your turn, you first draft 3 cards, then make 3 moves. You may spend your moves by (1) playing a Note card, or (2) playing an Action card.<br/><br/>Other ways to spend moves include: (A) Moving a Note card from one chord to another, (B) buying Accidental Tokens, or (C) spending 2 moves to draft 1 additional card.<br/><br/>Note cards must be diatonic to be played, according to the active Key Signature. Action cards range from punny composer cards like &ldquo;More-zart&rdquo;, which allows you to draw 2 more cards, to powerful music theory concepts like &ldquo;Major 7th Steal&rdquo;, which allows you to turn the tables by stealing another player's hard earned Key Signature tile!<br/><br/>Accidental Tokens make it easier to complete chords. They are placed on Note cards to raise or lower the note by a semitone/half step, depending on whether the sharp or flat side is facing up, respectively. Accidental tokens are bought by selling a dotted quarter note/dotted crotchet worth of Note cards.<br/><br/>All cards are drafted from a pool of 6 cards, so memory, prediction and counter-strategizing are key to victory. Every play is noteworthy - you can't miss a beat!<br/><br/>The player who most recently practiced music goes first, so go practice!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Will you have what it takes to become the world's most famous explorer?<br/><br/>Salt and Sail is an exploration and discovery game, set during the great Age of Sail. 2 to 5 players take on the role of an intrepid captain, in search of fame and fortune. Along the way, you will hire Officers to assist you, purchase new ships and unique tools, and sell goods and treasure to fund your expeditions. But, be careful--possible encounters with pirates isn't your only concern: the other player captains are trying to make those rare discoveries first and steal the glory for themselves!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Core Game Mechanics:<br/>- Modular hex board that is constructed based on various maps included in the rulebook. These maps provide various ways to play the game and customize game length and depth based on player count and time allowances.<br/>- Bag draw. Players use a Skill Bag with tokens to dictate success instead of using dice. The bag can be modified to augment a player's success with a particular skill.<br/>- Variable player powers. Players can recruit Officers with unique abilities and skills, purchase new ships with different strengths and weaknesses, and even equip said ships with tools to further augment their power.<br/>- Emphasis on discovery. While there are elements of adventure (fighting pirates, navigating through storms) that will cause players to react in various ways to overcome, and even some economics to drive item acquisition, the core concept is to use Rumor cards and reach various tokens on the board, wherein players can attempt to make Discoveries. It is through these discoveries that players will generate the most Fame Points (Victory Points).<br/><br/>",

Those who procure barrels cheaply and stow them in an easily accessible manner on their deck can later unload them at lucrative moorings for countless doubloons.<br/><br/>Each port that players head for has four moorings. Those who stay there a little longer can secure not only barrels, but also treasure maps and sailors at particularly good conditions. More modest short stays, however, offer the invaluable advantage of getting everything in the next port that no one else can get. On the way, clever seafarers should not spurn a treasure map or two &mdash; and they might want to be armed with battle-hardened sailors against stormy pirates and even stormier hurricanes.<br/><br/>Variably insertable tiles change the game board for each new play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The classic SPI game covering the battle of Waterloo returns in this redesigned version. Napoleon's French Army of the North faces Wellington's hodge-podge Army of the Low Countries, who are fighting for time while awaiting the arrival of Blucher's Prussian Army of the Lower Rhine. The maps use natural contours to show elevations, withterrain features including the critical chateaux, villages and farms, walls, woods, hedges, sunken roads, slopes, streams, and marshes.<br/><br/>Most of the vividly colored counters represent combat units: infantry battalions, cavalry squadrons, artillery batteries, and engineer detachments. Many battalions have additional counters for specialist skirmishers, or additional counters to represent greater size. Unit capabilities are modified by a number of formation markers, from infantry squares to cavalry vedettes. Individual leaders enhance unit performance, while each army's high command is represented by key commanders and unit headquarters.<br/><br/>The game mechanics have been streamlined; a single dice roll inflicts casualties and disorder. Units and larger organizations wear down over time and must be rested or risk a catastrophic collapse. Finesse trumps brute strength in combat; players must utilize a variety of arms, formations, and tactics to seize key ground and destroy enemy units. Hidden movement allows each player to prepare surprises for the other. Multiple scenarios cover everything from the historical battle to a fight for an individual chateau. The French player may decide on an early start, or even on turning the battle into a demonstration.<br/><br/>The Prussian arrival can occur early with fewer troops, or later with more, at the will of the allied player. It's all here, from massive cavalry charges to grand bombardments to skirmishing to wild melees, with the fate of Europe in the balance.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>1 32-page Color Rules Book<br/>1 16-page Color Battle Analysis &amp; OB (extract from S&amp;T #292)<br/>7 Counter Sheets (1,960 die-cut counters)<br/>4 34&quot; x 22&quot; soft maps<br/>2 Player Aid Sheets<br/>1 Time Display Sheet<br/>3 Army Display Sheets<br/>1 Prussian Off-Board Approach Sheet<br/>6 6-Sided Large Dice<br/>Storage Bags<br/><br/>",

More specifically, the order in which these are chosen is fixed; that is, the second player to choose in each round will always be choosing the high/low number piece.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, the player with the most points is awarded a medal worth 5 VPs, the second most 3VPs, etc.  After a number of rounds, the player with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Miskatonic School for Boys is an all new game by game designer Garrett Herdter. The game takes place at a boarding school for boys. Unfortunately, the school is also a training ground for dark beings from the 5th dimension. These beings, while capable of unfathomable universe destroying power, have a long way to go in order to reach their full potential. The MSfB will help them reach that potential!<br/><br/>In a twist on the Miskatonic genre of games, instead of players taking on the roles of humans trying withstand the dark forces around you, players instead play the dark forces of the Lovecraft universe (or at least &ldquo;dark forces in training&rdquo;). The game takes place during the final 3-day test in the &ldquo;Human Possession&rdquo; course. Each 5th dimensional horror starts the test in control of one of the human students of the school. The goal for the beast is to figure out which student they are in possession of before the other members of the class figure out which student they are controlling.<br/><br/>Designed by Garrett Herdter, MSfB takes the standard deduction game concept of &ldquo;I try to guess the other players hidden roles&rdquo; and flips it. In MSfB, each player has no idea who they are, but they DO know who all the other people are. This dynamic and the fact that 1 or 2 of the players can lie during the game make MSfB hysterical fun while still being easily accessible and quick to learn.<br/><br/>",

With a variety of fun categories, only a few seconds to answer, and a different partner every round, each game&rsquo;s a toss up of who&rsquo;s going to Sync Up! the most to win.<br/><br/>To start, one player picks a card, reads the category and the first question followed by &quot;Ready. Set. Sync Up!&quot; (to give partners a quick moment to think.) So for example, the category is &quot;pizza&quot; and the question is a &quot;a meat topping... Ready. Set. Sync Up!&quot; Couples shout out their answers. If they both say &quot;pepperoni&quot; they move ahead 2 spaces on the game board. If one says &quot;pepperoni&quot; and the other says &quot;sausage,&quot; they stay where they are on the board. At the end of each round, players switch partners and play a new card. To make the game more interactive and challenging, players can use Make A Bet Cards to score extra points by guessing how many times partners Sync Up! on each turn. First player to reach the Winner Circle wins the game.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player first rolls all five dice, sets aside at least one die, then rerolls, with the process continuing at most five times, at which points all the dice will be set aside.

Each set contains the same cards! Purpose of the game is to conquer map-cards with ground units, aircraft and ships similar in the mechanics to the Warhammer 40.000 card game.<br/><br/>Turn sequence is (in short form):<br/><br/>draw cards phase<br/>place and redeploy cards<br/>attackers attack phase (defender can block)<br/>defenders attack phase (attacker can block)<br/>retreat phase<br/>winning phase<br/>end of turn phase<br/><br/>The game is only sold in pre-constructed theme decks with 55 cards each. Currently available for the Axis player: A German starter deck (rules included), a German expansion deck. For the allied player: A British and US starter deck (rules included), a British and US expansion deck. The starter decks and the booster packs can be bought in many shops fully translated in English! The last edition fully translated was the Pacific Edition. In German there are a lot more: A Russian and an Italian expansion set, the &quot;Fall Gelb&quot;-Edition with German and French cards, the polish and finnish game packs and the top-seller &quot;Africa Edition&quot; - a box that contains both an axis and an allied starter set. Both are balanced very well and recommended for beginning with HoW. In February of 2009 there came a second box called &quot;Road to Victory: Westfront 1944&quot;. The third starter box edition &quot;Philippines 1944 - The biggest battle of all times&quot; is released in Novembre of 2012.<br/><br/>Expanded by<br/><br/>    History of War - &quot;Fall Gelb&quot; Edition<br/>    History of War - Italian Expansion Set<br/>    History of War - Russian Expansion Set<br/>     History of War - Polish / Finnish Expansion Set<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by<br/><br/>    History of War - Pacific Edition<br/>    History of War - Africa Edition<br/>    History of War - Road to Victory: Westfront 1944<br/>    History of War - Philippines 1944: The biggest battle of all times (newest edition)<br/><br/><br/>From the publishers homepage:<br/><br/>&quot;Though widely realized in board and computer games a long time ago World War II was till now a dark horse in the Trading Cards (TCG) field. On the o&shy;ne hand it depends surely o&shy;n the fact that the Second World War is a very serious topic which of course does not simplify its realization in a card game, o&shy;n the other hand this very background requires the great historical precision and complexity that seemed difficult to achieve until now.<br/><br/>The alphaBIT company from Hannover (Germany) takes charge of this problematic topic from now o&shy;n and excels by a balance of realism and subtle intuition. History of War (HoW) presents the Second World War solely as the tactical fight of units.  Retaliatory weapons, atom bombs or personal names like those of generals are deliberately excluded from the game.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is a conquest of land cards that should bring together 15 win points. A means to an end in this case are the mentioned units and the HoW really succeeded to bring together three large parts of a war: fight by land, by air and by sea.<br/><br/>It makes the game truly particular as even computer games have difficulties in combining these three types of units. As a rule they are divided into land/air or sea/air. In History of War o&shy;n the contrary  the players can use all the units like infantry, tanks, artillery, fighters, bombers, submarines and cruisers in o&shy;ne and the same deck without problems. In addition just like in all other TCGs they can choose freely in a great card pool and make up their own deck.<br/><br/>There appears another positive aspect  that would please first of all the players with not much means: there is no degree of rarity in HoW. All the cards of an edition are available exactly o&shy;nce in a set which means that a player knows what he buys and already with a few sets is equipped enough for a chosen side. The mentioning of the units provokes the question how they could be paid. The usual  principle in other TCGs  works here as well: some special cards provide the resources. These are called base improvements in HoW. These cards deliver not o&shy;nly the important  technical values (TVs) necessary for payment of units, action cards and effects, but they possess as well useful qualities, so that the mere choice of his base improvements has decisive  consequences for a player. The TVs deliver also the country improvements that can be placed directly in the countries and thus are imminently exposed to the attacks of the enemy, but then dispose of the interesting effects. The units paid with the TVs are played in the so-called deployment zone. The units have different attack and defense values for various areas like land, air and sea. The victory flags o&shy;n the unit cards necessary to conquer the countries are transformed into the win points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>More detailed and profound division of the values, ammunition consumption, moral and so o&shy;n known from other games were deliberately resigned to make a game easy-to handle. Such special characteristics of the units were replaced by useful abilities that make the game fluent and the rules clear. The final transformation of the units into win points is based o&shy;n historical accuracy.<br/><br/>All the cards show the high quality pictures or even photos of the Second World War and the unit cards are enriched by engineering data. HoW is surely a must for lovers of strategy games, interesting and affordable o&shy;n top of that thanks to the absence of  degree of rarity.&quot;<br/><br/>You can find lot of pictures and a rule discussion forum on their German webpage: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.history-of-war.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.history-of-war.com</a> [you can change the webpage language clicking on the UK banner on the left, once in]<br/><br/>",

As the city is unexpectedly hit by disaster, and its inhabitants are slowly turning into hordes of hungry undead, an ever-growing assembly of zombies is beginning to queue outside a little corner pub. Inside a small group of patrons suddenly becomes aware that the evening is going to be more than just beer and snacks, and they're forced to take up whatever arms are within reach to avoid the fate of ending up as someone else's snack.<br/><br/>In Pints of Blood, you must keep the zombies from entering the pub, and they're outside ready to move forward whenever they see any sign of life at the windows or door &ndash; or if they're pushed from behind by the ever-increasing number of zombies that are being brought in by the still running public transport.<br/><br/>But no need to despair as help is on its way! Rally with your fellow survivors and hold out until the rescue vehicle makes its appearance. Be aware, however, that it might not have room for everyone, so at some point you may have to decide whether to support your mates or to fight for yourself &mdash; but if all buddies die before help arrives, the zombies win.<br/><br/>",

Only those who cleverly enter the numbers rolled receive points. But be careful: If you take too long, you will quickly become the unlucky one, because then the field is left to the other players or you even collect minus points. If you want to win, you have to find the right balance between speed and strategy.<br/><br/>How it's played: <br/>For each roll, all players enter numbers in ascending order. Each number may only appear once per row and column. In this way, the players gradually try to fill the rows and columns. If a player is the first to complete a row of numbers, they can write down the number in the middle as a point. The trick is: if you wait too long, you get fewer points or minus points. The player with the most &quot;lucky points&quot; wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fujian Trader is a victory-point based, gateway game. The theme and mechanics are based upon the re-discovered Selden Map which depicts trading routes in China and had been lost for nearly 300 years. In Fujian Trader, players assume the role of Ming-era merchant families following trading routes in the East China Sea. Victory-points are gained by trading (or raiding) the goods of iron, silk, and rice for silver and influence. To win, players must accrue the most victory-points in order to successfully endure the Manchu invasion and subsequent Ming Empire collapse at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The game board is divided up into six different regions separated into six different colors. Each region has several ports. Players start out with a number of ports (dependent on the number of players) and may receive goods based off of which ports they control. When ports produce goods depends on the roll of a colored die. The color the die lands on coincides with the six colored regions and determines which produces goods for that round. Players may purchase additional ports with money gained from trading or incite rebellions in already controlled ports to wrestle them from an opponent.<br/><br/>The game ends after the Manchu first invade the Ming Empire. The invasion starts once the last of three Manchu Move cards is drawn from the Event deck. Players then have a three rounds to trade goods and two rounds to store silver, thus accruing victory-points. After the third round of the invasion the game ends, and players tally up victory points to determine who wins.<br/><br/>",

But careful, some of those briefcases might explode...<br/><br/>Aim of the game<br/>Collecting the most points by collecting &quot;explosive cards&quot; with high values.<br/><br/>Game play<br/>There are four sets of 8 cards, each with values from 1-8. Each player gets a set of one colour.<br/>The explosive cards show briefcases with positive values from 1-8 on one side, and bombs with negative values from 1-8 on the other side. They are shuffled and a number of explosive cards equal to the number of players plus one are laid out, positive side up. The remaining explosive cards are set aside.<br/><br/>Players try to win as many positive explosive cards as possible. They take turns placing one of their number cards in front of one of the explosive cards. Whoever places the highest total on each explosive cards gets to take that card.<br/><br/>Rules for card placement:<br/><br/>     You cannot play another card directly on top of one of your own cards.<br/>     Each number can only be played once per explosive card, i.e. if another player has already played the 4 on an explosive card, you cannot play a 4 on the same explosive.<br/>     8 is an exception; there is no restriction on how many 8s can be played on one explosive card.<br/><br/><br/>If there are already 7 number cards on an explosive card, a player can blow it up by adding an 8th card. The explosive card is then turned from its briefcase side to the bomb side, and the player who wins it gets negative points instead.<br/><br/>A round ends when all players have played all their cards. Card values on each explosive card are added up, with the last card in a row earning its owner an extra two points. The player with the most points in one row wins that explosive card.<br/><br/>Players get back their number cards and a new round starts with new explosive cards.<br/><br/>The game ends when all explosive cards are gone or there aren't enough left to start another round.<br/>Players add up the points from all their positive and negative explosive cards.

Only the player who recognises the shadows and remembers which magical creatures have not danced around the campfire can get their little magical being to the end first.<br/><br/>In Shadow Magic each player takes a turn at being the shadow dancer and moves the turntable in the shadow box on which the chosen figures are standing. The other players look at the canvas of the shadow box from the front and compare the shadows of the figures gliding past with the outlines of the figures on the cards that are lying in front of the box. After one round, the light is switched off and the guessing game begins.<br/><br/>Only players who look closely and have a good memory can find the cards with the figures that didn't dance around the campfire after each round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1891, and the city is London. The Napoleon of Crime, Professor Moriarty, has planned out a series of fantastic heists that will grant him untold fortune and power. However, he knows that the brilliant detective, Sherlock Holmes, has caught on to his plans and is trying to sabotage them! Prepared for this possibility, he has hired all his henchmen through intermediaries and hidden himself among them. Who will be discovered first: Sherlock or Moriarty?<br/><br/>Moriarty's Machinations is a party deduction game for 5-10 players. Each player starts with a unique role card, and which roles are in the game depends on how many players there are. Each role has different information about the other players.<br/><br/>Phase 1: Information Exchange<br/>At the start of the game, a script is read to inform each player of their privileged knowledge about some of the other players.<br/><br/>Phase 2: Heists<br/>Players take turns selecting crew members to go on Heists. If the majority of the table approves, then that crew goes on a Heist. Each crew member is given a set of Heist Cards. Cops can choose to Foil the Heist, and it only takes one cop to successfully do so. If no Cops Foil the Heist, then the points are awarded to the Robbers. Otherwise the Cops get the points.<br/><br/>Phase 3: Accusation<br/>Once one team has reached the required point total, the Accusation phase begins. Jack the Ripper and Inspector Lestrade reveal their roles publicly and try to guess who the leader of the opposing team is. If they guess correctly, their team wins. If they tie, then the win is based on Heist points.<br/><br/>",

Players take six weakness/strength cards (one side is weakness and the other side shows strength), open a situation card in the middle of the table, each player picks one card from hand and explain how the weakness or strength can help them overcome the situation they are facing, then they vote who told the most persuasive story.<br/><br/>3. Open top five cards from the deck and lay them on the table weakness-side up, one player becomes a protagonist, everyone including the protagonist him or herself picks two weaknesses that are most likely the protagonist's personality and write the card numbers on their sheets. Each correct guess gives you a point.<br/><br/>To achieve victory, you must try hard to understand other players&rsquo; characteristics and also make yourself appealing.<br/><br/><br/>     You can play FLIP with people you&rsquo;ve just met or people you&rsquo;ve known for a long time.<br/><br/><br/>A few examples of the weakness/strength cards:<br/>(I'm stubborn/I have strong will)<br/>(I act without thinking/I enjoy challenging myself)<br/>(I take too much time to make decisions/I think deeply first, and then act)<br/><br/>",

For centuries she has been plotting and scheming, lying in wait until the time when she could bring the world to its knees under darkness and ruin. That time has come and the Water Witch will reign!<br/><br/>In Paradise Lost, you will play a legendary Hero. Take on the role of Alice, Aladdin, Beowulf, Billy Goat Gruff, Hercules, Merlin, Perseus, or Red Riding Hood. The Water Witch has ripped you from the pages of your own story, bringing you and the others to life in order to fight an evil Villain, possibly your nemesis: the Jabberwocky, the Warlock, Grendel, Troll, the 9-headed Hydra, Sir Mordred, Medusa, or the Big Bad Wolf.<br/><br/>The Water Witch is certain that if the great Heroes of fables and lore perish, it will change reality and the world will succumb to despair.<br/><br/>You and your fellow Heroes must travel the realms of the Water Witch; deduce whom she has summoned as her champion Villain and the weapon needed to defeat them, all the while preparing for the fight to come. Along the way you will speak to Oracles, learn secrets from the Truthseekers, recite ancient scrolls, seek the Villain&rsquo;s hideout, and much, much more. Tread careful, the journey will be perilous and it is possible to enrage the Water Witch even further.<br/><br/>Paradise Lost is a fantastical deduction game for 2-5 players where you can&rsquo;t win just by having the most complete information.

        "description": "Extracted from consimworld.com:<br/><br/>IBEROS is an operational simulation of low to medium complexity of warfare in the Ancient Peninsula. It is packaged in a slipcase box that includes one 60 x 52 cm map, 240 full-color die cut counters, one standard and scenario rules booklet, one historical commentary booklet, and two player aid cards.  Game turns are one year each: after collecting silver and/or receiving it from Rome, you can pay your troops, recruit tribal levies, and perform other administrative functions. After that comes the Operations Phase. During it, each force (one or more Field Armies, Tribal Levies, etc) can perform certain operations, using Operation Points (OP). These actions include combat, diplomacy (you can try to control any area through diplomacy), besiege cities, pillage, recruit mercenaries, or build colonies. At the end of the Operations Phase, forces retire to winter quarters.<br/><br/>The most outstanding features of the game are the Prestige Point Level and the differences between Regular and Irregular warfare.  The Prestige Level (PP) simulates the prestige of the civilized armies (Punic, Romans, Sertorians) among the Iberian tribes, and the tendency of the latter to switch to the side that seems to be winning... Certain results of the CRTs add or decrease the PP level of each side. Then, if your PP level is above 2, you have positive die roll modifiers on the Diplomacy Table. And vice versa if your PP level is 0 or lower.  Leaders play a key role since their modifiers are applied to retreat before combat, diplomacy, all kinds of combat, operations, interception, etc. Leaders are rated for Military and Diplomatic skills (The highest is Sertorius, with +3 +3). Roman leaders (Praetors, one each for Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior) are changed randomly each year when they're elected by the Senate of Rome. If you have quality leaders, your chances of avoid/provoke combat are higher, and vice versa.<br/><br/>The irregular, &quot;hit and run&quot; tactics of the inhabitants of the peninsula characterized the Roman conquest and were the cause why the Romans took 200 years to completely control all of Hispania. All combat units have Regular and Irregular Combat factors. The attacker can always choose which CRT he is going to use. The idea here was to simulate the asymmetrical war fought out between the Roman/Punic invaders and the native peoples. If you can impose your style of fighting, (the other can not avoid combat) then you have the edge over the enemy.<br/><br/>The game is played in scenarios. There are 9, from the Punic reconquest of Iberia (237-221 BCE) to the Cantabria campaigns of Caesar Augustus (24-19 BCE). There are a set of common rules for all the scenarios, plus specific rules for each scenario. There are fast playing scenarios (such as the Roman Civil War, or the Cantabrian wars) that can be played in two-three hours, and other that take 6-10 hour of play (up to 17 turns, such as Cato's campaign of 195 BCE, or the II Lusitanian War).<br/><br/>Each scenario has its own Random Events Table. Some of the Random Events included are: plague, Excellent/Bad Crops, Tribal Rebellions galore, bribing enemy mercenaries, Numidian rebellion (for the II Punic War scenario), Alliance with Mithridates (Sertorius War scenario), and more.<br/><br/>Optional rules include assassination of enemy leaders (you must spend Operations Points and Treasury Points for that), Rivalry between Iberian tribes (The Romans took advantage of this to apply the &quot;divide and conquer&quot; routine), Mountain redoubts (Mons Vidius, Mons Medulius...), or troop upgrade.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to build up the flowers before Rosalina reaches the flower island!<br/><br/>On your turn you roll the die and take a piece of the same color. The first piece of a color goes on the same color flower field. The next pieces go on top of the previously placed pieces.<br/><br/>The back of the board is a variant for older children. In this variant you don't have to recognize colors, but shapes.<br/><br/>",

A survival and adventure game, in which players must cooperate to face the threats of a zombie apocalypse.<br/> From 1 to 4 players, Apocalypse Z can be played through  individual scenarios or completing a campaign. Choose between the main protagonists of the novel, Viktor, the ex-military; Lucia, the adolescent; Cecilia, the nurse; and Manel, the survivor accompanied by his cat, Lucullus.<br/> The Apocalipsis Z&acute;s game structure ensures great replayability, since each scenario can be played over and over again with different results. Run away from the zombies, hide in the school, find resources in the mall, or try to retain the threat from the police station ... Survive the Holocaust, survive Apocalypse Z.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/> &iquest;Qu&eacute; suceder&iacute;a si un d&iacute;a al levantarte descubrieses que la civilizaci&oacute;n se est&aacute; cayendo en pedazos?<br/><br/>Eso es lo que le sucede al protagonista de Apocalipsis Z, un joven abogado que lleva una vida tranquila y rutinaria en una peque&ntilde;a ciudad espa&ntilde;ola de provincias, hasta que un oscuro incidente m&eacute;dico en un remoto pa&iacute;s del Caucaso tiene lugar.<br/><br/>Paulatinamente lo que tan solo era una peque&ntilde;a noticia breve en los peri&oacute;dicos se transforma en una epidemia de proporciones devastadoras que amenaza con aniquilar a toda la humanidad. A medida que la enfermedad se acerca devorando pa&iacute;s tras pa&iacute;s, el caos comienza a cundir en Espa&ntilde;a.<br/><br/>M&aacute;s de 500.000 ejemplares vendidos avalan la calidad de los libros escritos por Manel Loureiro.<br/><br/>Apocalipsis Z es un juego cooperativo, con una duraci&oacute;n aproximada de 40 minutos, recomendado a partir de 14 a&ntilde;os, de 1 a 4 jugadores donde nos pondremos en la piel de uno o m&aacute;s personajes, que son los protagonistas principales de los libros, cada uno de ellos representado por una ficha de personaje con sus propias caracter&iacute;sticas y habilidades especiales.<br/><br/>El juego se estructura alrededor de una campa&ntilde;a no lineal donde se podr&aacute; decidir entre varias varias l&iacute;neas argumentales. Aunque tambi&eacute;n se puede jugar cualquiera de sus escenarios por separado.<br/>La campa&ntilde;a tiene un componente narrativo, integrado en la historia contada en los libros y situada entre el primer y segundo volumen de la saga. Los protagonistas empiezan esta aventura refugiados en el hospital de Meixoeiro y deber&aacute;n abandonar definitivamente ese refugio por causa de un incendio.<br/><br/>Dicha narraci&oacute;n est&aacute; llevada a cabo por el propio autor de los libros, Manel Loureiro.<br/><br/>En cada escenario tendremos una selecci&oacute;n de cartas para el mapa inicial, adem&aacute;s de una selecci&oacute;n de eventos y unos objetivos a cumplir antes de que se acabe el mazo de amenaza. Esto hace que el prop&oacute;sito principal del juego sea cooperar estrechamente para conseguir unos recursos concretos manteniendo al grupo a salvo. Si nos dedicamos a acabar con todos los zombies a base de &quot;tirar dados y realizar ataques&quot; es posible que fracasemos.<br/><br/>En cada ronda los jugadores deciden el orden de actuaci&oacute;n de sus personajes buscando la mejor estrategia para el grupo, al inicio del turno de cada personaje se roba una carta de amenaza que puede tener consecuencias positivas o negativas, en funci&oacute;n del evento revelado. O nefastas en caso de ser la &uacute;ltima carta de evento.<br/><br/>Cada personaje dispone de unos puntos de acci&oacute;n para gastar cada turno, las acciones posibles son: mover, atacar, buscar recursos en edificios, levantar barricadas, intercambiar objetos del inventario con otro personaje o llevar a cabo la acci&oacute;n especial de algunos personajes.<br/><br/>Los puntos de acci&oacute;n disponibles se ver&aacute;n disminuidos por las heridas, limitando las acciones a realizar en cada turno.<br/><br/>Listado de componentes b&aacute;sicos del juego<br/>1 Caja del juego<br/>1 Reglamento<br/>1 Libro de Campa&ntilde;a<br/>1 Dado de seis caras<br/>4 Personaje + fichas personaje <br/>25 Zombis <br/>30 Cartas de objetos <br/>36 Cartas de eventos <br/>30 Cartas de localizaci&oacute;n/calle<br/>1 Carta de L&uacute;culo y su token<br/>20 Contadores de acci&oacute;n/herida<br/>35 Marcadores (V&iacute;veres, Combustible, Medicamentos, Municiones, objeto y barricadas).<br/><br/>",

During set-up, each player takes a set of tokens and two tiles, keeping them secret from other players; four tiles are turned face-up to form a communal pool.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player adds one or more tiles to the playing area from his personal area, the communal pool, or both locations. Each tile must be laid adjacent to at least one other tile in play, and the color of the tile must be next to the color of adjacent tiles on the color wheel. Thus, a green tile can be placed adjacent only to yellow or blue tiles, a red tile only next to orange and purple, and so on.<br/><br/>If a player completes a hexagon &ndash; dubbed a &quot;wheel&quot; &ndash; on his turn, he marks the center of the hexagon with a token. A &quot;full wheel&quot; with all six colors is worth three points, a bi-colored wheel worth two points, and all other wheels worth one point each. To end a turn, a player optionally refills his hand up to two tiles, then adds new tiles to the communal pool to fill it to four.<br/><br/>When all the tiles have been played, the game ends and the player with the highest score wins. Vizia includes five variant rules for advanced play that can be mixed-and-matched as desired, such as scoring a bonus for a player's largest group of tokens, removing a token from play in order to move a tile already on the board, and reducing the number of communal tiles (which lessens luck of the draw).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this uproarious &quot;office-themed&quot; dungeon crawler, you'll take on the challenging task of completing your bullying boss's assignments with the help (or hindrance!) from your fellow players!<br/><br/>Each round, a Monster card (representing a project) is unveiled for all players to see. The value on the Monster card signifies the combined effort required from all players to finish the project successfully.<br/><br/>Players take turns discreetly playing a &quot;Battle card&quot; face-down and declaring which card they've played (Stationery 1/2, Computer 1/2, or Absence Form). The catch is that other players can call out bluffs, verifying whether you've played the card you claim to have. Those who guess incorrectly or who are caught bluffing receive a &quot;Cracked Credit&quot; and must reveal their card without the opportunity to deceive.<br/><br/>The round continues until someone believes that the overall contribution equals or exceeds the value on the Monster card, and they call to &quot;close the case.&quot; All other players must then decide whether to &quot;second that decision&quot; or opt for &quot;not quite yet.&quot; Once the choices are made, reveal all the Battle cards on the table to determine if the case is successfully closed.<br/><br/>A successful closure means the player who initiated it receives the Monster card along with all the credit (VP) it holds. Players who &quot;second that decision&quot; also earn some valuable bonuses. However, if the attempt fails, the player who called for the closure faces penalty points!<br/><br/>Can you navigate the &quot;toxic environment&quot; of this office dungeon, or even thrive amidst the web of lies and backstabbing (because you're skilled at it)? It's time to find out!<br/><br/>",

It is a game about playing irreverently with words and meanings.<br/><br/>In each round, one player serves as a judge and reads aloud a question or fill-in-the-blank prompt from a green card.  The other players submit white cards, each containing a verbatim quotation from Moby-Dick, as suggested completions for the prompt.  The judge reads all the submissions aloud and chooses the best one, construing &quot;best&quot; however he or she sees fit. The winner keeps the green card, everybody replenishes their white cards, and the role of judge rotates to the next player. At the end of the game, whoever has the most green cards wins.<br/><br/>The game depends on understanding the particular wit of the other players and strategically playing answers to appeal to each round's judge.  The sheer irreverent weirdness (sexual and otherwise) of Moby-Dick is what makes the game exciting and hilarious.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Freeman's Farm and Lundy's Lane were Turning Points in the American Revolution and the War of 1812 for America in the formation the United States Army.<br/><br/>Using the Battle Manuver system (first seen in Waterloo), this is a low complexity game designed by Richard Berg. It is a full box game.<br/><br/>The Battle Manuver syster game uses cards, one deck for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to drive the game. Each player gets a certain number of cards each turn - often a different number for each player! - but never his full deck. The cards are used to determine movement, combat, and actions such as Counter-Attack, and Rally, among others. Players may play as many of their cards up to 5 when it&rsquo;s their turn, using each card for only one of the possible three purposes. Play passes back and forth between players, until both players have used all their cards&hellip; and the turn is over.<br/><br/>Turning Point is thus a game of card play and management, which unfolds on the historical battle map - it uses squares, rather than hexes &ndash; with the use of some large counters. This is a game of position, feint, and sudden attack with what you hope are better odds (since you don&rsquo;t know what cards your opponent will play, if any, and you never know what his final strength will be). No dice are used. And there are no CRT&rsquo;s.<br/><br/>Playing time for each battle is about 2 hours, sometimes less, and the rules are only 8 pages! Balance is excellent, and because of the use of cards and their random distribution each turn, no game is the same as any other. And the game is playable solitaire (with specific rules for doing so).<br/><br/>",

Actions and funds are limited, however, and competition is fierce.

        "description": "Indian handlooms date back several centuries. The tradition of weaving by hand formed a part of the country's cultural ethos. A piece of fabric with a design could indicate the meaning, its purpose, the culture of the era, and even the way the people lived. Handlooms thus became a precious part of the generational legacy and exemplify the richness and diversity of a country and the artistry of the weavers.<br/><br/>Innovative weavers with their skillful blending of myths, faiths, symbols, and imagery provide the fabric an appealing dynamism. The appeal of the handloom lies in introducing innovative designs that cannot be easily replicated. This rich tradition of hand weaving still thrives at Kanchi, a prominent temple town in South India. Fabrics were part and parcel of trade done by the Indian weavers for which they got back &quot;Annas&quot; or goods in return.<br/><br/>In Ettana: The Looms of Kanchi, players take the role of weavers to complete designs and be the first to make eight &quot;Annas&quot; (victory points). In detail, set up the 5x5 game board by placing one of 25 yarn discs (five of each in five colors) on each space, then place 16 of the 18 number tiles (three each of the numbers 1-6) at the intersections of the spaces on the game board; place the remaining two number tiles on the side in the reserve, along with one yarn disc of each color. Each player receives a random action card, a random design card, and two tokens with a value of 1. Each player places their pawn on one number tile.<br/><br/>On a turn, you roll the two dice: a color die and a number die. If a player's pawn is touching a space that shows the color rolled, they receive a 1 token; if the die shows black, which is not a yarn color, you take an action card and no one else gets anything. You can then move your pawn as many spaces as the number rolled, after which you can swap two yarn adjacent to your location. Additionally, you can play as many action cards as you wish, and you can pay tokens to take design cards, take action cards, and swap any two yarns. Action cards allow you to move, swap, gain tokens, replace a yarn or number with one from the reserve, etc.<br/><br/>If the pattern of yarn on the board matches a design card in hand, you can reveal that card to score its points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from MMP website:)<br/><br/>In July, 1763, Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) was under siege as part of Pontiac&rsquo;s Rebellion. A relief column was sent out from Carlisle in order to try and break the siege. The column was under the command of Colonel Henry Bouquet and consisted of approximately 500 British soldiers of the 42nd Highlanders, 77th Highlanders, and 60th Royal Americans.<br/><br/>On August 5th, several hundred Indian warriors of the Delaware, Shawnee, Mingo, and Huron tribes attacked the column east of Bushy Run Station. The British held out, and that night a redoubt was constructed from the supplies, and the wounded were treated inside this perimeter. The next day, the Indians attacked again, and a British counterattack broke the Indians. The British column was able to advance, and relieve Fort Pitt on August 10th.<br/><br/>The Battle of Bushy Run game uses a simplified version of Iwo Jima: Rage Against the Marines (in Operations Special Magazine Issue #1). The American Indian units use a concealed map and have dummy units to help hide their movement. The British force is a mix of soldiers, grenadiers, and scouts (who can reveal hidden Indian units). To increase replayability there are random events each turn (8 turns, 10 event chits, so 2 are not played each game...their identify is not revealed). Both sides have multiple ways in which they can secure victory.<br/><br/>",

No luck of the draw here, it's entirely up to you! Get as many enjoyment points as possible and win the game! Plan and anticipate what the others will do so that you can claim birds from the backyard or from other cats.<br/><br/>Each player targets another cat and a bird. They will then select their actions for the two rounds of play. All of the cards are revealed simultaneously, the actions are resolved and when the smoke clears, some cats may have birds and some may not.<br/><br/>The birds will hang out at the bird bath, in the grass, on the fence or in the trees. The bigger birds will need to be stalked before catching them and you will have to time everything just right. Once you do catch your bird you will have a choice to either press your luck and play with the bird to double its enjoyment point value or to just eat it. The longer you play with it, the greater the chance of it being stolen by another cat.<br/><br/>Taunt cards allow other cats to distract you and cancel your actions. Nothing is safe in this backyard!<br/><br/>A basic rules set is included for younger players and beginners.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "another damn Civilization game is a dice-rolling civilization game.<br/><br/>Dice determine the player's available actions. Each player throws 3 dice to determine which actions they have available to them in a round. The players get re-rolls for abilities. Money and tokens are placed in the corresponding boxes. These are emptied beginning with the #1 box down to #6. Every token allows for an action. Either taking resources (black piece or new token for a player), placing a token on the civilization track, or moving a token on the track.<br/><br/>A player can have up to a maximum of 26 tokens on the civilization track. Once a token is on the track, a new token can be placed adjacent to it. Different spaces give different abilities to the players, such as re-rolls, victory points, or resources. Some spaces have a cost to use them, such as War, which allows the removal of a token from another player.<br/><br/>The civilization track consists of 30 spaces. It starts with the 1st space, Writing, and ends with the 30th and final space, City. Once a player places a token on the 30th space, the game ends and victory points are tallied. Points are obtained from the civilization track and for every 3 black token, coin, or playing piece leftover. The player with the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>The fourth game by Martin Wallace in spielbox.<br/><br/><br/>",

The first to arrive, and thus to claim the better G0 system, were those of Islamic origin . . . The second mission, of Chinese origin, arrived some 50 years later, in a crippled colony ship . . . they found [the G0 system] jealously guarded by a handful of Islamic ships, and had to crash-land instead in the far poorer quality red dwarf system. This early incident left a lasting animosity between the two cultures . . . Over two centuries, the Islamic culture established itself in its system, exploiting its mineral and ecological wealth to the fullest, and developing a thriving interplanetary society. The Chinese colony, on the other hand, was forced to spend the past 150 years in a spartan struggle for survival against marginal environments and the unpredictable flares of [the red dwarf] . . .  Now, however, the pressure of population on the Chinese and the pressure for additional resource supplies on the Islamic has brought these two cultures into direct conflict.<br/><br/>",

The are ready to offer the aboriginal Onkilon tribe various civilization achievements, from clock and football to submarines and atheism, as an exchange for the natural resources of the island. But still, it&rsquo;s quite necessary for envoys at least to explain the indigenes what are they talking about before persuading them to buy all these surely useful miracles of culture, science and engineering because the only way to talk to the Onkilons is in primitive pictograms which represent simple words such as &ldquo;fish&rdquo;, &ldquo;mother&rdquo;, &ldquo;egg&rdquo;, &ldquo;cold&rdquo; or &ldquo;above&rdquo;.<br/><br/>My Understands You is a board game of associations and creative thinking. Players one after another take a role of civilization ambassador, who should explain any expression of the modern world using simple images. Others play as the Onkilons and try to guess what the guest of the Big world is talking about. Victory points charge by right conjectures and understandable explanations. When everyone will play as an envoy for 2 to 5 times, depending to the number of players, the game ends and the winner is defined according to the earned points.<br/><br/>At the game beginning each player gets a set of the voting tiles with the numbers from 1 to 6 on them and 3 stake tiles: smoked herring, reindeer hide and mammoth tusk. By the way, players acquire 3 big cards with civilization achievements, 2 words on each (for example, &ldquo;oil derrick&rdquo;, &ldquo;backpack&rdquo;, &ldquo;deodorant&rdquo;, &ldquo;calculator&rdquo;) and 6 small cards with pictograms (such as &ldquo;woman&rdquo;, &ldquo;bird&rdquo;, &ldquo;loud&rdquo;, &ldquo;night&rdquo;).<br/><br/>Each turn the envoy puts his achievement cards in a column. Upper word or phrase is counted as the first, the one under it as the second and all way down to the lower as the sixth one. Then the envoy decides which of the achievements he will explain with the gained pictograms. He should use 2 or 3 small cards: for example, &ldquo;water&rdquo;, &ldquo;fire&rdquo; and &ldquo;below&rdquo; for &ldquo;oil derrick&rdquo;. After the decision about the achievement and its explanation he puts the needed small cards with face up and the number tile face down.<br/><br/>Other players acting as the Onkilons join the round. They try to guess which of 6 achievements the presenter is trying to show. They find the word or phrase on the big cards that is the most suitable for the played pictograms and lay out the appropriate number tiles face down as well. Also the indigenes need to use one of the stake tiles. Victory points depend on the stake if the word hypothesis will be right: 1 point for a herring, 2 for a hide and 3 for a tusk.<br/><br/>When all the Onkilons have made their choice, everyone turns the voting tiles face up to see who guessed the achievement correctly. If all the players guessed or nobody did (in other words, the explanation was very clear or too complicated), tribesmen get 1 point each and the ambassador has nothing. If the right choice was made only by few natives, they get points according to their stakes and the envoy gains points for the biggest stake of the correct answer. <br/>Ex-presenter takes new cards in exchange for used and hand over the turn.<br/><br/>My Understands You suits for the company of friends and for families as well. The most comfortable gameplay is for the 3-4 players &ndash; everyone can be a presenter for enough turns. Still the game can become longer for more player as well: achievement cards can be played for another round. Even if you&rsquo;ll get the same words, the explanations can be fully different so it will let you discover lots of imagination inside your mind that you didn&rsquo;t even suspect of.<br/><br/>",

To start a round, a theme is shown, e.g. &quot;Women like it...&quot; Everyone thinks about this and selects a tile from his set, but does not show it to the other players. Players lay their tiles picture-side down on the table, and these tiles are mixed up with random tiles from the stock.<br/><br/>On the board there are slots which are numbered from 0 to 6. Tiles are placed next to slot 3 so that everyone can see the pictures. The goal for each player is to have his tile reach the top (slot 6) of the ranking of items that best meet the requirement. Each player receives points equal to the slot number where his tile is at the end of each round. The point total is reduced if another player correctly guesses which tile belongs to whom and marks it with the player's color.<br/><br/>When it is your turn, choose two tiles in the same row/slot and compare them to one another in meeting the requirement of the theme. (Important: You can only compare two tiles in the same row. If there is only one tile in row 4, you cannot compare this tile to one in a different row!)<br/>For example, say, &quot;I think women like lipstick more than a car.&quot; Then, you move the lipstick tile up one row and the car tile down one row. After you have done that, the others can guess your tile, by placing a stone of your color on any tile. Each player has only one stone of each color and can only guess the active player, so this must be done selectively and timely!<br/><br/>The round ends when one tile reaches the 6 slot and another is in the 0. Then, you calculate the points. Each player gets points equal his slot, minus every correct guess stone on the tile. So, if your tile is in slot 4, but there are 2 correct color stones are on it, you get only 2 points (4 - 2 = 2).<br/><br/>Before the beginning of the next round everyone gets a new picture tile from the stock and a new theme is shown.<br/><br/>The first player to score 15 points after a round ends the game and is the winner.

Ideally the most valuable lava chips will tumble into your mouth, and you'll avoid the gray ones since these cold lava bits will cost you a valuable point chip at game's end.<br/><br/>When not enough lava remains in the bag to pour out in the current round, the game ends.<br/><br/>",

Be sure to watch what ingredients other chefs are adding to get a hint at what kind of recipe it is!<br/><br/>The different ingredients will add balance and taste to the pot of curry. Some ingredients are &quot;secret ingredients&quot; which also have a special ability, such as looking at the recipe or balance limit of a curry in which you've seen neither.<br/><br/>At any time, instead of adding an ingredient, a chef can claim a pot of curry, taking all the ingredient cards added, and is finished taking turns until all other chefs have also claimed a curry. If the ingredient balance exceeds the curry balance limit, then it can't be called curry and that chef scores no points. If under the limit, add up the ingredients taste and the chef with the best tasting curry wins!!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tako Judo &ndash; the timeless sport of octopus wrestling &ndash; is an abstract strategy game for 2 to 4 players in which the object is to prevent your opponent(s) from being able to move. Played on a 64-square board (for two players) or a 100-square board (for three or four players), each player controls the head and eight tentacles of an octopus. The head takes up a 2x2 square area, and each tentacle takes up one square. Any piece can move like a Chess queen (any distance along an open orthogonal or diagonal line, but without jumping) provided that there is also a clear line of sight between that piece's original location and the head piece for the octopus to which it belongs. A player whose octopus is no longer able to effectively move its head or any tentacles (either move them at all or only harmlessly move a tentacle back and forth between a couple of squares) is pinned and eliminated from the game. Last octopus to move freely controls the sea and wins the game.<br/><br/>",

After Headman announcing the number of wolves, each player looks at one location card and chooses a location to put his own cowboy meeple on it.<br/><br/>Scoring: when everyone has done, reveal all character and location cards. Scores are tallied for each location. Players put their own cowboy meeple on a location with wolves may lose sheep, or a location with sheep may collect sheep.

Those cards may contain different parts of robot, 200 and 300 money bills as well as special actions. In the middle of the table players place three stacks of different bonus cards.<br/><br/>The gameplay is divided into players turns, during which they can perform one of four different actions. The player may put one of his cards with a part of robot to bidding. The person that gives the highest price for it has to place it in front of himself, adding it to the robot he is building. The next action that may be performed is putting one of the cards from hand to the players bank, in order to store money. The players may also buy bonus cards from the middle of the table or play the special action cards from hand. When one of the players builds the complete robot, the game finishes and the points are summed up from the built robots and fulfilled bonus cards.<br/><br/>The goal of each player is to build the most valuable robot and at the same time to thwart the opponents&rsquo; plans. Due to the necessity of bidding and possibility of playing the special action cards the gameplay is filled with negative interaction so enjoyed by many players.<br/><br/>",

And they also add crews, get support from others, and collect income in  &ldquo;Reals&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Each player gets resources by putting their own Crew chips on the West Africa boards. By developing the areas, players offer the goods sought by the Kings. In return, they gain Ships and Adventurers to help them. Players also advance their Nobles along the Lisbon track, building Markets, and collecting Crew. Players also get Support Cards in return for Gold.<br/><br/>Each King will pay out Reals to the best merchants. When all the Kings have paid income, the game ends and players collect a final income and bonuses. The richest player is the winner. Try to be the best merchant in Portugal!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The word &quot;t&eacute;los&quot; is an old Greek word, meaning &quot;end&quot; or &quot;purpose&quot;, so it's no surprise that in the game T&eacute;los the last part of a round is what matters.<br/><br/>T&eacute;los is a trick-taking game in which you need to save your lowest card for the last trick. Winning the last trick gives you points, and in this case the points are negative. The first player to gain 32 points loses the game.<br/><br/>Saving your lowest card sounds easy enough, but the challenge comes from every player needing to play a higher card than the highest card already on the table in a trick. If a player can't play a card equal to or higher than that card, they must play their lowest card instead. Players therefore need to be careful which card to play when to tactically save their lowest possible card for last.<br/><br/>",

Theoretically an unlimited number of players can join the game - the only limiting factor is the number of pencils and sheets of paper you have at hand.<br/><br/>In each round a letter is randomly determined. Then each player writes down a substantive for each word category that start with the determined letter.<br/><br/>The categories are (among others): Place of murder, weapon, escape vehicle. They are predetermined on the sheets that come with the game.<br/><br/>The first player who manages to find a word for each category stops the round and the results from all players are compared.<br/><br/>For each word a player wrote he gets points: 5 if other players wrote the same word / 10 if no one else thought of this word.<br/><br/>Example: <br/>Random letter: C<br/><br/>Anna wrote for the category &quot;escape vehicle&quot;: car<br/>Bob wrote: cab<br/>Roy wrote: car<br/><br/>Anna and Roy get 5 points each. Bob gets 10 points.<br/><br/>After this the next round begins.<br/><br/>The game can continue as long as the players agree on.<br/>Finally all points are summarized and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>This game is the &quot;black stories&quot; variant of a classical game called &quot;Stadt, Land, Fluss&quot; (City, Country, River) which is played by almost every child in Germany (e.g. at school during breaks).<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t============================From the publisher website:<br/><br/>Duisburg, D&auml;nemark und Donau waren gestern- in dieser bltur&uuml;nstigen Version des Klassikers &quot; Stadt Land Fluss&quot; geht es um Mordmotive, Tatwaffen und Fluchtfahrzeuge.<br/>50 Blatt mit Spielanleitung<br/><br/>Translation:<br/><br/>Duisburg, D&auml;nemark and Donau were yesterday - in this bloodthirsty edition of the German classic &quot;Stadt, Land, Fluss&quot; (categories) it's all about murder reasons, weapons and escape vehicles. <br/>50 playing sheets and manual<br/><br/>",

Each round, one player is the director and takes charge of flipping over a card that depicts one or more of these bits. Everyone races to place a finger on the depicted items first, and once you've placed a finger on an item, you can't move it again. Once all the depicted items are found (assuming they were correctly figured), the fingerers place those items in front of themselves, then the director flips another card. If a card shows an item previously claimed, the owner of that item must secure it with a finger; if they don't, any opponent who touches it first will steal it away.<br/><br/>If a player has seven or eight bits in front of them, then the round ends and everyone scores one point for each item that they collected. After playing as many rounds as the number of players, the game ends and whoever has scored the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Under each general&rsquo;s command are armies of varying strengths and abilities. Players take turns deploying pieces into their Camps and advancing them down the game board toward their opponent&rsquo;s Camp. There four different types of pieces that represent legions of soldiers: they are fierce Footmen, stoic Spearmen, heavily armored Horsemen, and battle-ready Bowmen.<br/><br/>As a general, players are tasked with strategically matching their pieces against ones that they are strong against. At melee combat, Footmen slaughter Spearmen, Spearmen skewer charging Horsemen, and Horsemen trample Footmen. Bowmen are a deadly asset at a distance with the advantage of ranged combat but are utterly defenseless when attacked at close range.<br/><br/>Even with an advantage, nothing is 100% certain with Vici&rsquo;s mechanic of rolling Battle Dice. While an advantage in combat gives you an extra Battle Die, fate may not be on your side once the defending and attacking strengths on the dice are revealed. Choose your moves wisely and conquer your opponent&rsquo;s army. Only with cunning strategy can you outmaneuver your enemies and achieve glory!<br/><br/>",

In order to secure the Welsh border, William the Conqueror (recently crowned as King of England) established loyal Norman nobles in strongly garrisoned Earldoms along the frontier. What followed was decades of warfare and diplomacy as these &quot;Marcher Lords&quot; sought to extend their domains by subjugating the stubbornly independent Welsh.<br/> The Marcher Lords is a simulation of the Norman conquest of Wales in the 11th century on a grand strategic scale. Players assume command of Norman Earls or their Welsh foes, and make the decisions on a area movement map that will determine the course of the war. To be successful, the Normans will have to fortify their conquests by building castles and hold out against Welsh counterattacks, Viking raiders and various other threats.<br/><br/>The 11 x 17&quot; map covers all of Wales. The 208 counters show Kings, Earls, knights, teulus, Vikings, Irish and more.<br/><br/>The newer boxed version says it is 2-4 players.<br/><br/>",

A player must conquer new fortresses and upgrade existing ones so to increase income, and gain access to stronger and bigger units. Each unit has different innate skills (power, range, &amp; speed), and some special abilities which add many strategic maneuvers, fun, and replay-ability.<br/><br/>The game is straight forward and easy to learn; it does not limit the player but rather gives freedom of action. In each turn, a player can receive money, build units, upgrade fortresses, move and attack as much as his resources and units allow him. There is no specific action sequence. a player can do what suits him best.<br/><br/>",

Everyone is hungry and looking for tasty prey: The time is right for an Aqua Brunch! You will choose how lavish the banquet will be, but beware of the jellyfish because they might give you indigestion!<br/><br/>In this card game, you must collect turn by turn the best combinations of predators and food. Each turn, players receive three cards &mdash; two face-up and one face-down &mdash; then they pass one card to their left-hand player until someone calls &quot;Brunch&quot;. If you want to continue passing, you have to draw an aqua card (which usually grants penalties in the scoring phase). When all of the aqua cards are gone or everyone has agreed to &quot;brunch&quot;, players start the scoring phase. Everyone then plays one of their score (food) cards; whoever played the strongest combination chooses one of the just played score (food) cards, then the next player chooses, etc. After six rounds, the game ends.<br/><br/>",

If there are already cards in the Reserve Area at this point, you must also take from the reserve any candy cards that match the ones you have drawn from the center of the table and add to your player area.)<br/><br/>2. Eat candy (take the corresponding candy cards from your player area and stack them face down to do that. They are now your Eaten Candy and cannot be taken by another player)<br/><br/>You can only take one candy card available in the center of the table if you still don&rsquo;t have a card of the same type in your Player Area. If you already have both of the candy cards available, that means you are a Sweet Tooth! And now you have to discard all the candy cards in your Player Area that haven&rsquo;t been eaten yet.<br/><br/>",

You are one of the elite of this nation, and your objective is to stash enough money in an offshore trust fund that you can retire comfortably. Invest your income in stocks, properties and bonds, then exert influence on the government to manipulate the economy for your personal gain. Orchestrate the downfall of other elites by destroying their personal life through car accidents, expensive divorces, and shotgun babies. Do you have what it takes to survive in this cutthroat world of money mania?<br/><br/>Wongamania: Banana Economy is an economic and modern finance board game that reflects the complexity of modern investment portfolio management by incorporating multiple asset classes that behave differently under different economic situations. Deviating from the traditional auction mechanisms used by most stock-trading board games, Wongamania: Banana Economy uses a combination of resource management, environment manipulation, and take-that mechanisms to reflect the brutal competition and uncertainty of the modern global financial markets. Players have to manage a portfolio of stocks, properties and bonds, and assess the risk-reward of holding them in different allocations. Players are also able to influence the economic environment by manipulating it to either benefit their personal investment allocation or to wreck havoc against other players who are using a different asset allocation strategy. Players are also able to make use of their money for other purposes, such as sabotaging the personal lives of other players, hiring professionals to disrupt the strategy of other players and buying insurance to protect against sabotages. Whoever stashes enough money in a off-shore trust fund wins the game.<br/><br/>Wongamania: Banana Economy is a reimplementation of the 2014 game Wongamania (only available in SEA), and multiple changes have been made to cater better to the international audience.<br/><br/>",

But you also draw a card to your hand from which you offer a card to another player. Some are good (go ahead, pass, shortcut), others bad (wrong way, engine trouble, flat tire, breakdown). If they accept, they play the card on themselves; if they refuse, you play it on yourself.<br/>An odd mix of bluff and dice rolling, with little strategy.

Players draw a card that determines a topic sound like &ldquo;Ha-&ldquo; or &ldquo;Eh&rdquo; along with a list of eight different scenarios. Individual players then draw a card that assigns them a scenario from the list to enact. Without using any body gestures, players act out their scenario to each other and try to guess who was assigned what.<br/><br/>The Game of Saying &lsquo;Huh&rsquo; will test your skills of wit and mimicry and bring plenty of laughter and fun to game nights. The game is played in rounds using a different Task card for each round. At the top is a single word or a short phrase you will each have to say, but each of you in a unique way. There are 8 ways listed on the Task card from A to H and you&rsquo;ll be secretly assigned one of them at random. You might have to say &lsquo;Hello!&rsquo; like you&rsquo;re talking to a pet, like you&rsquo;re a vampire or like you&rsquo;re the president. There are lots of common phrases and sayings, as well as a few actions thrown in for good measure. But here&rsquo;s the tricky part: you can only use your voice and facial expression to convey the meaning of what&rsquo;s on the card. Gestures or movement of any kind below the neck are not allowed. When you&rsquo;ve finished making your impression, everybody votes in secret, assigning the correct lettered task to your performance.<br/><br/>When everyone&rsquo;s finished acting their part, it&rsquo;s time for the big reveal: you&rsquo;ll score if you guessed correctly who acted out which cue, and collect points yourself when others correctly identify your performance. The player with the most points when all the voting is complete wins the game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Players may buy commodities with no current demand and speculate that demand will appear close enough to make a delivery worthwhile.<br/><br/>Players may purchase &quot;shares&quot; but these are merely a game-ending mechanism; once a player has a majority of them they may declare it. Twelve more turns are played and that player wins if they still have the majority (and at least one ship and enough cash).<br/><br/>",

A group of imbalanced, but brilliant individuals race to create life and reject death! This is a grisly and often criminal undertaking. &nbsp;In the end, when the townsfolk come bearing torches and pitchforks, will you meet your demise in a blaze of glory, having conquered life and death? &nbsp;Will you be the legendary Dr. Frankenstein--or will you be just another nut-job with a lab full of spare limbs and torsos?<br/><br/>&mdash; from the publisher<br/><br/>In the Demise of Dr. Frankenstein you roll a number of dice, 6 for 2 players, 8 for 3 or 4 players, then those dice are placed on different action options based on the numbers rolled.  The number one lets a player influence Igor, number two lets a player take body parts from the graveyard and so on.  That allows players to influence different village members and accomplish different tasks on their way to building a Frankenstein Monster. After players use the clinician to study, the trader to get goods, bribe officers to look the other way as they construct different contraptions, and visit the curator, the villagers reach their anger boiling point and put an end to it all by buring down the doctors' efforts.  Victory points are scored and then it's on to the next round until all players have had a chance to go first one time.<br/><br/>",

Indian players get to select one or two of their active tribes, but the rest are dealt to them randomly. There are usually more Indian tribes available than what are active each turn, but players don't really know which ones are inactive.  This can be unsettling to the U.S. player as he must decide where to deploy his limited troops and columns.<br/><br/>All players compete to earn victory points.  The U.S. player is faced with the task of building up sufficient resources (settlements, towns, railroads, mines, etc.) to maintain existing states and convert territories into states. The Indian players play the role of guerrillas to earn victory points, but also can deny resources to the U.S. player. However, he must be very careful not to suffer too many casualties, as this could cause his tribe to go on reservation or become extinct, which costs the player dearly in victory points.<br/><br/>",

A square piece moves horizontally and vertically, a circle moves diagonally and a cross combines the two moves.  Opposing pieces are captured by landing on top of them to form towers. A tower may move as many squares as pieces it contains. &quot;Power&quot; squares in each corner allow unrestricted movement. Once a tower reaches the height of six pieces, it can no longer move or be captured.  The game is won when black or white owns three towers of 6 pieces.<br/><br/>Both offensive and defensive strategies are possible and players should remember that a tower of 6 cannot move or be captured, but it can still block!<br/><br/>",

The Department of Inexplicable Events has placed the area under quarantine; nothing can get out of the area until the zombie threat runs its course. One player plays as the Zombies, whose goal is to kill all Survivors. The remaining Players are Survivors, whose goal is to collect supplies and find shelter to outlast the zombie threat and the quarantine.<br/><br/>Survivors win if they are still alive when the Zombie Player runs out of cards in the Zombie Deck, and the Zombie Player's hand is empty. Each Survivor has 3 life, and they can be hurt by either Zombies, or other Survivors. By playing Supply cards while they are at a Shelter, Survivors &quot;wait a week&quot; and the Zombie player is forced to discard cards.<br/><br/>Survivors travel from location to location collecting Supplies and Munitions and killing or evading zombies placed in their path by the Zombie player. They must also watch out for the other Survivors who may at any time, betray them to steal their food and supplies, or use them as a distraction to save themselves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With the sun setting in the horizon, adventurers glide in on their flying carpets, searching for valuable treasures in palaces and bazaars. But steering a flying carpet to the proper destination is a lot trickier than it sounds. A strong wind can push a carpet off its course and into a desert, even though its intended destination was the camel bazaar. But maybe the magic lamp can still save the day?<br/><br/>In Fliegende Teppiche (&quot;Flying Carpets&quot;), players try to guide their flying carpets to the most attractive destinations to score the most points &ndash; and by &quot;guide&quot; read &quot;toss&quot; as the carpets are actually cards. To set up the game, each player receives one carpet (two in a two-player game) and a set of genie cards. Shuffle the 52 destination cards.<br/><br/>To set up a round, the active player turns over destination cards one by one and places them on the table as she desires. A card can't be placed more than the width of a card away from other cards, and at least 1 cm must separate adjacent cards. After revealing twelve cards, the player can swap cards or rearrange them to some degree. Then the player to her left &quot;flies&quot; his carpet onto the destination cards, followed by each other player with the active player going last. Once all carpets have flown, check to see who claims what:<br/><br/><br/>    If a carpet lies on no destination cards (or is only underneath cards), return it to its owner, who receives nothing.<br/>    If a carpet is alone on top of one or more destination cards, the carpet's owner claims these cards, whether or not he wants to.<br/>    If more than one carpet is on a destination card, the players involved simultaneously reveal one of their genie cards. The player with the highest genie claims the destination card, then swaps that genie with the player who revealed the lowest genie.<br/><br/><br/>If four or more destination cards are still on the table (and they're not all deserts), fly the carpets again. Once fewer than four cards remain, compare the number of palaces held by each player (with magic lamps counting as a palace if a player chooses to do this). The player(s) with the most palaces scores five points, while the player(s) with the fewest loses five points. Remove palace and used lamp cards from play, then pass the destination deck to the next player, who lays out twelve more cards. Players toss carpets, etc.<br/><br/>Once all players have laid out cards once (twice in a two-player game), the game ends. Players score additional points for claiming pairs of matching bazaars (5-7 points), sets of different adventure cards (1-15 points), and treasures (3 points), while losing five points for each desert claimed. Magic lamps can cancel a desert or be used as a wild card. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "<br/>        The whisper of your club as it brushes the grass, the impossible arc as your ball sails through the crisp morning air, the perfect spin as it lands on the green and rolls toward the cup... Do you have what it takes to be a famous golfer? Find out today with Famous Fairways - the World's Smallest Golf Game!<br/><br/><br/>Famous Fairways is a fun, fast-playing take on the sport of golf. The game pits two golfers against each other but also against the course itself. The path to each hole is dotted with hazards and the golfers must choose their clubs carefully to avoid them. Each club can only be used once per hole, however, so players must weigh the value of the perfect shot against the shot that best limits the options of their opponent. Famous Fairways is Game #5 in Famous Games Company&rsquo;s line of World’s Smallest Sports Games and serves as the perfect rematch on the 19th hole.<br/><br/>",

A third player acts as moderator. Each player would get two tries and the questions were now statements with a word missing. The players have to guess which word would be given most often. The player who had the higher score after two rounds would play the Super Match round. The first step would be to guess the most popular answer of a survey. The second step is to match the response of the moderator. The player who has won the most money after three games is the winner.

Hooker began forging the AOP into the weapon he and Lincoln knew was needed to defeat the Army of Northern Virginia led by Robert E. Lee.<br/><br/>Using his cavalry aggressively in conjunction with the newly formed military intelligence unit, Hooker fixed Lee's location and conceived a brilliant plan to sweep him from the field. Hooker's army, now numbering 135,00 men in eight corps and an artillery reserve would confront the Army of Northern Virginia's some 59,000 souls on ground of its choosing.<br/><br/>The movement began on April 26th, 1863 behind a dense screen of Federal cavalry, foiling the prying eyes of rebel spies and scouts. Surprise was complete, but ahead lay the thickets and dense woods of the Wilderness. Little did the Union soldiers suspect the ignominious outcome that awaited them. For Lee, recovering quickly, launched a counterstroke still studied today for its sheer audacity.<br/><br/>Designed by award winning Richard Berg, Chancellorsville places you in command of either army.<br/><br/>Units are demi-brigades. Each hex on the three maps is around 265 yards and each turn is an hour. At this scale, players must master both operations and tactics to be ultimately successful.<br/><br/>",

Your Career card lists how much time and money you can spend on each turn. On your turn, you may play cards from your hand, but only if you have enough time or money to pay for them (some cards, like &quot;Lucky Lottery&quot; allow you to add your two scores together). The cards you play feature life goals that are worth points. You may also get married and have children which costs you time but earns you bonus points. When the Early Life cards are used up, play proceeds with the Later Life cards. This deck also has the Letter cards &quot;L&quot; &quot;I&quot; &quot;F&quot; and &quot;E&quot;, and when all four of these cards are drawn the game ends.

SWMGamers.com used these rules and organized a series of Dejarik games at Gen Con 2015, and planned a tournament there.<br/><br/>The game is played on a circular board of 25 spaces, divided into three concentric rings. The outer and middle rings are each divided into twelve checkered spaces, while the inner circle is a single space. Each player places their four monsters on squares on the outer ring opposite each other, and places the card with the monsters' statistics beside them. Every round, the players roll a d20 to determine initiative, then take turns activating the monsters. Each monster can move and attack once per round according to its speed, statistics, and special attacks as listed on its card. Once all monsters have activated, a new round begins. Play continues until all monsters on one side are destroyed.<br/><br/>",

This variation adds the ends of the dominoes to make a multiple of five for scoring. Five-up is very similar to other games such as All Fives, Muggins, and Sniff.<br/><br/>In Five-up, each player starts out with five dominoes in their hand, and the first player can play any domino in their hand.  Thereafter, each player must play a domino from their hand if they can match it to a domino end on the table.  If they cannot play a domino from their hand, they must draw from the &quot;boneyard&quot; until they can play a domino on the tableau.  If the ends of the dominoes add up to a multiple of five, the player adding the domino scores one (1) point for each multiple of five (5) (IE: if the ends added up to ten (10), the player would score two (2) points).  The first player that plays their last domino from their hand, adds up the count remaining in their opponent's hand and scores the total divided by five (5) (IE: if the opponent had a count of fifteen (15) in their hand, the scorer would score three (3) points).<br/><br/>Five-up is played to a score of 61, and is usually played with a Cribbage board to keep score.<br/><br/>Five-up is unique in that every double domino played is a possible &quot;spinner,&quot; and plays can be played on all four sides of a &quot;spinner.&quot;<br/><br/>The rules for Five-Up were standardized and popularized in the 60's by Dominic C. Armanino, who wrote at least four books on Dominoes. He was a strong advocate and PR agent for this version of the game.  Life magazine called this version, A big new go for the humble domino.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Very good variant of Scrabble. Scoring is easier and allows for tactics in trying to outscore your opponent. The game can be forced to an end by reaching the bonus end-fields.<br/><br/>Lingua was also published in the Ravensburger Casino Series.<br/><br/>The game is played on a 17x17 board, the squares being one of four colours or white. A &quot;Start&quot; square is near one corner and there are four &quot;finish&quot; squares in the opposite corner. There are 132 tiles each being in one of the four board colours and players each start with 12 of these and top up to 12 after their turn.<br/><br/>The first player must play a legal word through the Start square and thereafter players must play a word that intersects orthogonally with at least one existing word in crossword fashion. Intersection may be achieved by playing a word that adds a letter at the beginning or end of an existing word except the adding of a plural &quot;S&quot; is not allowed.<br/><br/>You score for every letter in the word(s) created. Basic scoring is by tile colour, blue=1, yellow=2, green=3 and red=4.<br/>However, if you play a tile that matches the board square tile you have made an ACE. Each ACE initially scores a bonus or 10 in addition to normal score. After a player has made ten ACES, future scores are doubled, after 15 ACES trebled etc.<br/><br/>There is a bonus of 25 if you form a word with all the letters of the same colour (a Colourword).<br/><br/>The games ends when a). Players can no longer form words, b). when a player can no longer top up to 12 or c). when a player plays a word that goes over one or more of the Finish squares where they will earn the finish square bonus(es).<br/><br/>",

The coins you choose and the order in which you place them determine your ship's strengths, and you use the special abilities of your coins to destroy your opponent's coins one by one.

You and your fellow monkeys jump in the bumper cars and away you go. You have no idea why there is fruit all over the arena floor, but you aim to grab as much of it for yourself as possible!<br/><br/>Game synopsis:<br/><br/>Spin Monkeys has each player starting on a junction at the edge of the board with a hand of 5 cards.  The cards have 8 possible degrees of rotation from 45 to a full 360 degrees.  On each turn players choose a card, rotate their monkey clockwise to the degree, then move one junction per played card in front of them.  On the first turn you only go one junction, but as the game goes you can travel more junctions as you play more cards, picking up all the fruit you glide over, apples, oranges and bananas, leaving peels. Some cards have text that let you do special actions, like taking more fruit, or rotating during your movement.  As you go faster, traveling more junctions per turn, it becomes harder to avoid running into the sides of the board or other monkeys.  When you bump into the side of the board you lose cards, slowing you down.  If you crash into another monkey you get to spin them, and steal a piece of fruit.  After you play your hand, you get 5 new cards to direct your monkey with. Game goes until only one kind of fruit is left on the board. Most points in fruit wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pizza Rush is a fast-paced pizza-making themed strategy card game where players make a stack of pizzas and race to claim the greatest pizza chef card. Each player must strive to get rid of their pizza topping cards by piling them onto pizza base cards in order to win. But knowing when to save toppings for later could prevent players from getting stuck, as each topping placed onto a pizza must be higher in value than the previous topping placed!<br/>Once a round is complete, players are rewarded (or punished) for their performance by receiving game-changing pizza chef cards that change the gameplay for the following round. This cycle can continue until a designated final round decides an ultimate winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As soon as one player reaches 100 points, the game ends and the player with the lowest score wins.<br/><br/>The player at the left of the dealer starts by placing any word of not less than two or more than four letters in the center of the table, naming the words as they play it.

Number disks from 1-50 are shuffled, and one is drawn.  Players race to find three tiles whose equation (first times second, plus or minus third, or any other combination of two tiles multiplied and the other added or subtracted) adds to that total.  The first to do so wins the disk.  Whomever has the most disks when they are all claimed wins the game.<br/><br/>Nominally the game is for 1-6 players, although the upper bound is arbitrary and the rules say nothing about how the game might be played solo. Possible solo challenges involve seeing how many tokens you can claim in a set time (e.g. 10 minutes total) or how many tokens you can claim racing against a countdown timer (e.g. 5-10 seconds per token).<br/><br/>",

Be the one who impresses the judges the most (scores the most points) in order to win the coveted title of &ldquo;Photographer of the Year.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Each turn, you&rsquo;ll move your photographer one space in any direction, or more, according to that animal on your tile!  These movements are all thematic to the specific animal, and dangerous animals can move your opponent as well! For example the Red Fox&rsquo;s agility lets you move one, two, or three spaces, changing direction on the way, while the Cougar moves one direction, right to the edge of the board, knocking your opponent if they&rsquo;re in the way. You&rsquo;ll also collect that animal tile after using their movement, which you can use for photo cards and bonuses!<br/><br/>It's a tense back and forth as you and your opponent maneuver for the best positions and the best photos, try to impress the judges, and fight over the best campsites and landmarks. With strategic movement and a variety of ways to score, Yosemite is fast and challenging, keeping you and your opponent on your toes as you explore the beautiful park.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>&quot;The opportunities following the swift Japanese subjugation of Burma in early January 1942 were not exploited. For their chastened opponents, Allied operations in this theater of the war were limited to raids and small-scale offensives as war efforts in North Africa and Europe, as well as the South Pacific, drew higher priorities for resources and personnel. For much of 1943 and early 1944 the fighting in Burma was relegated to WWII's backwater by both sides. With the end of the monsoon season in 1944 the strategic situation had changed. Not only were Japanese fortunes declining precipitously elsewhere, but the build-up in Allied forces along the Burma/India border did not go unnoticed. Determined to pre-empt any Allied attack, the Japanese launched an offensive of their own in May, the largest they ever launched outside of China, against the Allied positions in and around Imphal and Kohima. The battles that raged among the jungles and mountainous hillsides of the Indian and Burma frontier, and the subsequent Allied victory that followed in July, marked a fundamental and permanent shift in the war. The Allied offensive in March 1945 was one marked by extensive planning and preparation, as well bold and daring maneuvers that not only took the Commonwealth and Indian forces across the Irrawaddy River to Rangoon, but crushed the defending Imperial Japanese Burma Area Army.<br/><br/>Defeat into Victory, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh, covers this neglected aspect of WWII history using a very interactive and easy to play design. The game has one 22&quot; by 34&quot; hex map that stretches from Dimapur in the north to Rangoon in the south. A countersheet with 280 half-inch units (mostly brigade and regiments in size) and approximately 16 pages of rules and charts round out the package. The game uses a chit-pull activation system. Rules cover supply (a crucial aspect in terrain that was among the most inhospitable of the war), various types of combat (fire, maneuver and assault), as well as morale and leadership. Rules also include random events (that simulate the effects of battles and decisions by higher-ups elsewhere), weather, Japanese suicide tank attacks (human combat destruction squads) and changing war goals. The air campaign is also simulated (in much more detail than generic &quot;air points&quot;). Scenarios include the initial Japanese offensive against Imphal and Kohima, two on the Allied 1945 offensive, as well as the Campaign Game. Tough decisions will have to be made by both sides as they allocate precious resources among their formations, determine their enemy's intentions and balance their plans, as well as attack and defend. &quot;<br/><br/>",

If it gets too high the people will turn you in for the reward.<br/><br/>Robin Hood: Hero of the People is a solo card adventure. The object of the game is to recruit your band of Merry men consisting of Maid Marian, Little John, Will Scarlett, Friar Tuck, Alan a Dale and Much the Miller. There is also a bounty on your head.

The true power, however, is a little further down the hierarchy in the different councils working under the City Council.<br/><br/>In the card-driven game Councils &amp; Contracts, the players act as developers who try to push their own objectives &mdash; namely, receiving lucrative building contracts. Therefore, it's important for them to gain influence in every one of the councils since doing so is crucial for deciding the assignment of building contracts. Naturally, all of the developers are keen to gain that influence...<br/><br/>Councils &amp; Contracts is the winner of the third game author's competition  &quot;Edition Kofferspiele&quot; organized by M&uuml;cke Spiele/Spielmaterial. In that competition the limitation was that the game fits in 11 x 7,5 x 3 cm metal box. Similar to Hart an der Grenze smuggling boxes. It is easy and light to take with you and has a lot of game inside the box.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>    1 City Hall card<br/>    5 Council cards<br/>    25 Influence cards (5 per player)<br/>    36 Building project cards<br/>    30 Employees (6 in 5 different colors)<br/>    5 Point markers (in 5 colours)<br/>    25 Transparent markers (to track influence)<br/>    1 Score board<br/><br/><br/>Basic gameplay:<br/><br/>Players start with four workers and can lose or gain more through actions.<br/><br/>There are four possible actions but only two of them are available depending whether player has workers in his play area or not.<br/><br/>If a player has workers on his play area he must place them either on council rooms (two in one council room or one in three council rooms) or start a building project using influence and depending on project one or two workers.<br/><br/>If a player doesn't have any workers he must take them out either from one council room (giving influence to each player with presence in that room) or finish a building project and take the depicted building action, which usually returns the workers back to players playing area.<br/><br/>There are eight buildings projects shown and after the building deck is depleted and only four building projects are shown the game ends. There are then two extra actions per player and final scoring.<br/><br/>Game variants:<br/><br/>First/short game: Remove cards 29 - 37 and the promos.<br/><br/>Mixed setup: After shuffling the A and B decks (separately) remove four cards from both of them.<br/><br/>Gears council: Use the gears (brown) council like the 5 player council instructs but receive gears influence.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Coming in a very awkward-sized box (42 x 42 x 3 cm), this is a distant relative of Scrabble. The 19x19 board is colored in two distinct areas, the central lozenge (just reaching the edges) being called the arena. The squares are sprinkled with numbers, of values increasing near the outer corners. The players have sets of 18 (for the two-player game) clear and smoked plastic of tangram shapes, some of which have a 2 or 3 over a certain square.<br/><br/>Starting in the center, the players lay their pieces so as to score, adjacent to an existing piece. A piece normally scores the numbers it covers; if it has a number of its own and that number falls directly over a scoring square, they are multiplied. You can sacrifice a piece by playing it upside down; it scores half (rounding down) and the opponent isn't allowed to play a piece adjacent to the sacrificed piece on his next turn --this is a neat trick when approaching a high-scoring area. You cannot sacrifice on the first turn. You cannot play outside the arena until you've accumulated at least 75 in score.<br/><br/>Score is kept with the help of tracking pieces on the outside edges of the game board.<br/><br/>The playing tiles come in six different shapes, each with their own name:<br/><br/>The Eye (covers 1 square);<br/>    The Rod (covers 2 squares);<br/>    The Quoin or Corner(covers 3 squares);<br/>    The Snake (covers 4 squares);<br/>    The Door (covers 5 squares);<br/>    The Gun (covers 6 squares).<br/><br/>",

The Ranking Player places the cards on the table face down in order.<br/><br/>　2. The card ranked number 4 is turned face up as a hint for the Guessing Player.<br/><br/>　3. The Marker which corresponds to rank 4 should be flipped to the green side. (Any time a card is revealed, flip the corresponding Marker too!)<br/><br/><br/>The Guessing Player tries to guess the Ranking Player's number 1 choice.<br/>The Guessing Player can ask questions, but whether to answer or not is up to the Ranking Player.<br/>The Guessing Player plays the card from his hand which has the symbol he thinks the Ranking Player chose for number 1.<br/><br/><br/>The Ranking Player opens the card with the same symbol as the one the Guessing Player showed.<br/>Was it number 1?<br/><br/><br/>If the Guessing Player guessed correctly, <br/>he gets a Love Token. If not, he gets nothing.<br/><br/><br/>The Guessing Player continues to guess the 2nd and 3rd choices, and so on.<br/><br/>When the Ranking Player has only one card left, the game is finished.<br/>(The highest score is 5 points. The last card is obvious, so you don't get any points for it.)<br/><br/><br/>You can high five each time you get a Love Token!<br/><br/><br/>Now the Guessing Player and Ranking Player switch roles.<br/><br/><br/>The total number of Love Tokens collected becomes the couple's score.<br/><br/>",

Austria-Hungary, Germany and Bulgaria are invading Kingdom of Serbia. The goal of the game for Central powers is to occupy all cities in Serbia, while Serbia`s goal is to prevent that and liberate all of its territory.<br/><br/>Each side has four types of units: infantry, cavalry, artillery and generals. The map is divided in hexagons and only one unit can occupy one hexagon. National military capacity is gained by controlling the cities and it is used to reinforce your armies. Each general has special abilities which are forwarded to the troops under his control.<br/><br/>The game lasts 14 rounds max where each round represents one period of 1914-1918 conflict and that period is described on one card of the Calendar and it brings special effects on one round of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Just like real geocaching, there are surprises along the way!<br/><br/>The game will never play the same way twice!&quot;<br/><br/>Description of game-play from the publisher:<br/><br/>The Game Boards<br/>● The trailheads are located by different buildings, where the boards are placed changes the difficulty in getting to those buildings. <br/>● Boards can be set side to side making deeper woods as opposed to the boards being set up off of two trail heads. This also changes how some events play out.<br/><br/>Caching Area Cards<br/>● This is the most randomizing factor in the game. However, Map cards and the ability to look at some of the cards reduces the &ldquo;randomness&rdquo; of landing on a card. If you know what is out there you can prepare for it.<br/><br/>Characters<br/>● The Character that you play changes the strategy that you use. If you have the Puzzler, you may wish to go right out into the Caching area before heading to the Sporting Goods Store.<br/>● The other Characters that are in play change your approach. If the Coin Collector is on the board you may want to wait to go to the Geocaching Mega Event until he or she has left the area.<br/><br/>Equipment<br/>● Cards are drawn at random, but you make meaningful choices each time. Deciding which piece of Equipment that you would like to activate will be based on your Character&rsquo;s abilities, other Characters, what Caching Area cards you know are out there, and the general strategy that you chose to take.<br/><br/>Event Cards<br/>● Some Event Cards have immediate effects, this is a random effect.<br/>● Other Event Cards can be saved to be used during your turn or at any time. Deciding when to use these cards and what cards you have will change each time you play.<br/><br/>GeoCoin  Goals<br/>● Each Geocoin has a goal that triggers its point value. Do you chase after a cache or do you go after the Geocoin&rsquo;s goal?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zombie House Blitz is a speed card game in which players try to save members of their family from zombies by getting people (cards) out of the house (stack) and into the cars (points piles) to safety. Players don't take turns, but rather race madly to get their cards into the shared scoring piles in the center of the table.<br/><br/>Each round of the game, players start with a stack of cards (their house) and three face-up cards (escape routes) next to them. When everyone is ready, play begins with each player flipping cards from his draw deck. Any face-up cards can be moved into the scoring area as long as they can be placed on top of a card of the same suit in ascending order (1-6). Once all the cards in a player's house stack are gone, the round ends. Players score points for family members who escaped (made it to the scoring area), but lose points for people eaten by zombies.<br/><br/>",

The player looks at this card in secret, and takes 10-12 purple chips and 2-3 green chips, depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>Each round, animal cards are revealed equal to the number of players. In clockwise order from the starting player, each player bids a number of purple chips, then starting with the high bidder (going clockwise from the starting player in case of ties), each player takes one animal card and places it face down on his stack. If a player discards one of his green chips, he takes two animals instead, stiffing whoever comes last in the round!<br/><br/>After all of the animals have been claimed, players reveal their collection. Pairs of the same type of animal score the sum of their numbers; if you have all four animals (two pairs), you receive 3 bonus points; if you have an animal which is not part of a pair, you lose points equal to its number. Each pair of purple chips is worth 1 point.<br/><br/>After tallying the points, players shuffle the cards, refill their purple chips, receive one animal in secret, then play another round. At the end of that round, players score again, this time receiving 1 point for each green chip still in hand. Whoever has the highest total over two rounds wins!<br/><br/>",

Attention: all the cards must go somewhere; none can be set aside. Cards from previous rounds cannot be exchanged. Negotiations are free and open. They end as soon as both players accept a proposal and say, &ldquo;DEAL!&rdquo;<br/>Once an agreement has been reached, the 2 players each take their share and place it behind their own screens.

        "description": "Livestock Uprising is a tactical resource management game in which you harvest farmland, marshal animal armies, and battle for control of the farm. Each player takes control of one of the four animal factions: pigs, goats, cows, or chickens. Each faction has its own barn and special attributes that impact gameplay.<br/><br/>Each faction has three Generals that move around the farm harvesting crops and marshaling troops. Initially, the Generals can harvest only the least valuable resource: grass. Players must spend their resources in order to marshal new troops, which unlock the ability to harvest better resources, e.g., a donkey allows its General to harvest corn. Players work their way toward harvesting the most scarce resources so they can marshal the most powerful troops. Each General can command only five Troops, so players often specialize the Generals based on their location, nearby threats, and distance from their barn.<br/><br/>The farm is an 8x8 randomly tiled board containing crops, obstacles, and empty fields. When setting up the board, a small 4x4 grid is laid out randomly, and each player positions his barn anywhere along the perimeter of the grid. The rest of tiles are then randomly laid down to form the final 8x8 board. When choosing a starting location, players must consider the available resources, distance to neighbors, and the faction's special abilities.<br/><br/>In addition to the common Troops, each faction may also marshal Special Forces. Each Special Force Troop gives the faction a distinct advantage: chickens gain a movement bonus, cows gain a defensive bonus, pigs gain a harvesting bonus, and goats gain an attacking bonus. Players also have three hidden Command Cards that they may play at any time to gain an advantage or get out of a tough situation. The Command Cards range in effects and are very valuable when used appropriately.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to destroy the other factions and take control of the farm. Players achieve this by forming a Super Army and triggering the end game. At any time a player may choose to form a Super Army if all of their General are in their barn. The Super Army combines all of the player&rsquo;s Troops together under a single General. This massive army gets an attack, defense, and movement bonus, but cannot harvest resources or marshal Troops. Forming a Super Army triggers the end game as the only effective strategy against a Super Army is to form one of your own. The Super Armies then drop the gloves and battle it out for all or nothing victory.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Between 1767 and 1846, war and intrigue dominated the Indian sub-continent. War constantly flared between the Indian kingdoms, both against one another and against the British and French interlopers. The Europeans, meanwhile, also busily fought each other.<br/><br/>Rob Markham's Soldier Raj builds on the highly successful model of Soldier Emperor to portray these conflicts. Over a dozen scenarios cover these wars, from Hyder Ali's defeat of the British in the First Mysore War in 1767 to Britain's final conquest of the Sikhs in 1846. Colorful leaders of the time are all present: Hyder Ali and Tippoo of Mysore. Sir Arthur Wellesley, the &quot;sepoy general&quot; who would become Duke of Wellington. The brilliant Madhav Rao of the Marathas. France's Admiral Suffren. Zaman Shah of Afghanistan, and the Sikh ruler Ranjit Singh. These and more lead your armies.<br/><br/>The playing pieces are the decadently thick tiles seen in Soldier Emperor and Granada: The Fall of Moslem Spain. Artist Terry Moore Strickland has gone well beyond those games; pieces like the Mysore Tiger Soldier or the Maratha War Elephant are tiny works of art.<br/><br/>As in Soldier Emperor, successful card play is a key to victory. Soldier Raj features high-quality playing cards, and includes a new deck of these for use in Soldier Emperor when playing the two games together.<br/><br/>Soldier Raj can also be played together with Soldier Emperor: Napoleon's Wars 1803-1815. Players can either add more seats at the table, or assign the Indian kingdoms to players with only European holdings. Britain becomes both more powerful in the combined game, and more vulnerable.<br/><br/>As in Soldier Emperor: Napoleon's Wars 1803-1815, players command their nation's military, political and economic destiny. The map is a painting of South Asia, with a network of areas and routes between them laid over it. Generals move their armies along these routes, attempting to conquer territory for their nation. Fleets control the seas around India; the locals have very little seapower, and Britain outnumbers France on the seas.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by dice rolls, with larger armies casting more dice. Good generalship is even more crucial in India than in Europe. Players win by taking the most territory, or by destroying their nation's enemies.<br/><br/>",

To do this, you need courage, skill, and a steady hand. But be careful! If you wobble too much and King Leo wakes up as a result, it can get very uncomfortable. The player who has been caught twice has rotten tomatoes thrown at them by King Leo's guards and will unfortunately be the loser. The other players can relish their victory in this wobbly test of courage.<br/><br/>In more detail, in Wobble King you use a wooden stick to try to retrieve at least one silver nugget from underneath the game board, after which you place the silver nugget(s) on the round spaces at the edge of the game board. If the game boards tilts so that at least one edge touches the table or the lion tips over, the player must take a tomato tile.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A mancala game.<br/><br/>From Mancala World:<br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mangala_II\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://mancala.wikia.com/wiki/Mangala_II</a><br/><br/>&quot;Mangala is a Turkish mancala game which was very popular in the 17th and 18th century. According to Metin And, a Turkish ethnologue, the game could be related to the &quot;mancala&quot; of The Arabian Nights (fifteenth night), one of the first literary accounts of mancala games. The game was depicted in Turkish paintings as early as in the 16th century. In Europe, it was first mentioned in 1694 by the English traveller Thomas Hyde. Mangala was also found by Edward Daniel Clarke in Balaklava, Crimea (now a suburb of Sevastopol) in 1801 and by Peter Emund Laurent on Chios Island (now Greece) in 1818. It might have influenced Mandoli (Hydra Island, Greece) and Ban-Ban (Bosnia). Mangala has almost the same rules as the Baltic German Bohnenspiel, which originated in Persia where it was known as Manqala or Manqalat.<br/>Two Ottoman Women playing Mangala (18th century)<br/><br/>The classic Mangala is still known in Turkey. However, the Mangala played in Gaziantep in Southeast Anatolia is not related to it at all, but is a close variant of La'b madjnuni (&quot;The Crazy Game&quot;), which was played in Damascus (Syria) in the late 19th century. More games called &quot;Mangala&quot; (again with quite different rules) are popular among the Bedouins in Egypt.<br/><br/>Mangala might be the first commercialized mancala game in a western country. A game called &quot;mangola&quot; (a common synonym for the Turkish Mangala at this time) was published by Jaques in England in 1863, after Walter Whitmore Jones claimed to have invented it. Jaques pattern book covering shows a thick wood board with two rows of six cells in which something like white beans are placed. The records of copyrights kept by the Stationers company, the Public Records Office at Kew, includes a volume covering 1862-64, which has an entry showing that the rules of Mangola were protected by copyright at that time. Richard Ballam, a board games collector, found an advertisement in the Illustrated London News (December 23, 1865) saying: &quot;Mangola, a new game. By the author of Squails, Frogs &amp; Toads etc. Wholesale Jaques &amp; Son&quot;. Claiming foreign or nearly forgotten boardgames as own designs happens frequently in the game industry. (...)<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Mangala is played on a board, which consists of 12 holes dug into the earth. Initially there are six glass beads (&quot;boncuğu&quot;) or cowrie shells in each hole.<br/><br/>On his turn a player distributes the contents of a hole, one by one, in a counter-clockwise direction into the succeeding holes.<br/><br/>If the last bead falls in a hole on either side of the board, making a total of two, four or six beads including the last bead, its contents are captured.<br/><br/>If this hole is preceded by other holes which contain two, four or six beads, their contents are also taken.<br/><br/>A player must move if he can, but passes when his holes are empty.<br/><br/>The game is finished when all holes are empty.<br/><br/>The player who captured more beads wins the game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Players can resort to sabotage, betrayal, corruption and bribes. They can employ devious telepaths, shapeshifter spies and honor guards.<br/><br/>They must hurry though. The end is near and when the third &quot;Doom!&quot; card enters play, the game is over and the winner is decided.<br/><br/>Are you brave enough to lead your people to salvation?<br/><br/>",

Use your influence and power to recruit experienced charioteers, to buy strong horses and chariots, and to earn the god's favor.  Gain prestige and honor from your fellow citizens through victory.<br/><br/>From the designer's website:<br/><br/>GAME CONCEPT<br/><br/>You are a Roman Aristocrat who uses your influence and power to hire an experienced Charioteer, to acquire an excellent chariot and to buy a strong horse to compete in a chariot race.  More importantly, however, you must offer sacrifices to the Gods to gain their favor as they help your team toward victory.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/><br/>The game consists of a cycle of &quot;Race Legs&quot; wherein players play Chariot, Rider, and Horse cards in an effort to win Victory Spaces on the race track.  In addition to these cards, there are also God Cards that provide special powers. Because players use up their cards (&quot;resources&quot;) to race, in each cycle there is an opportunity to acquire more resources by making sacrifices to the gods. The more you sacrifice, the better resources you receive. However, your sacrifice power is limited, so you must be careful to use it wisely.  Each cycle sets specific &quot;Racing Conditions&quot; that change from cycle to cycle, allowing for different strategies as the game progresses. The game contains a strong auction element, a fair amount of guesswork concerning what the other players will do, and a little bit of luck.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>83 Playing Cards<br/><br/>1 Game Board<br/><br/>15 Tokens<br/><br/>1 Die<br/><br/>1 Instruction Booklet<br/><br/>",

The game is mainly concerned on the air aspect of such a conflict. Land battles, naval operations and special forces are included, but serve mainly as a background of the air war.<br/><br/>The Polish player manages his squadrons and sends them against enemy troop concentrations with bombers and ground-attack aircraft, engages the enemy aicraft with his fighters, and decides about the use of his air-defence assets... hoping for the timely arrival of NATO squadrons coming to his aid.<br/><br/>The &quot;Agresor&quot; commands ground forces, supports them with his aircraft squadrons and tries to destroy the Polish airforce, or at least take out its airbases.<br/><br/>The idea behind Eagles and Missiles is based on scenarios being considered by the Polish staff and tested on big field war games such as: Anakonda and Dragon. Like in the real-world simulations the invasion is performed from three directions: the Baltic (naval invasion), Kaliningrad District and Belorussia. The main objective of the attack is the Polish &quot;lifeline&quot; of Upper Silesia, Warsaw and Gdansk.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>Rulebook in Polish and English<br/>60 counters<br/>3 decks of cards (Russian, Polish and world opinion / NATO reaction)<br/>Playing board dipicting the territory of Poland and neighbouring countries<br/><br/>Playing time is 60-90 minutes<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>&quot;Orły i Rakiety&quot; autorstwa Macieja Szopy to pierwsza gra planszowa podejmująca temat wsp&oacute;łczesnej wojny na terytorium Polski.

To do this, players must choose the club, decide the strength of the blow... and throw the dice to check where the ball ends!. A typical game lasts between 15-30 minutes, and the minimum age recommended is 5 years old.<br/><br/>Golf 'n' Roll takes place in a rectangular board with 4 golfer tiles, 4 circular numbered ball tokens and 4 dice (white, green, yellow and red).<br/><br/>The holes in the board are divided into squares, where golfers move after hitting the ball. Each of these squares have a gem whose color indicates the difficulty of that trail (green, yellow or red) and a flag indicating the presence or not of obstacles (free, vertical or cross mark). The latest of each hole have a darker green color, an they are called &quot;Green&quot;; one of them which also contains flag is called &quot;Hole.&quot;<br/><br/>The game is originally designed for kids and families, so it has a great simplicity, but it also has an &quot;History&quot; gameplay, where our players can acquire skills, which will be very much appreciated for advanced gamers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Qu&auml;senb&ouml; is a card game for the Decktet. It is similar to standard-deck Crazy Eights, but is, however, somewhat more complex due to the multiple-suit nature of the Decktet cards, and because the third consecutive play of the same suit is penalized by having to draw an extra card.<br/><br/>The author makes the historically dubious claim that  &quot;Qu&auml;senb&ouml; was a popular game at the court of the badger Charlemagne. Its name means 'too many.' The theme is thought to reflect political issues of royal succession in the many small kingdoms of the Empire; although some feminist historians believe it instead derives from the qu&auml;senb&ouml; pan, a cast-iron skillet capable of turning out vast numbers of sp&auml;tzle at a time.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Bounty hunters descend on the abandoned mansion where it is rumored to make its lair, each hoping to claim the prize. However, one of these hunters is actually the monster in disguise. One is forced to ask, then: who hunts whom?<br/><br/>Hunt: The Unknown Quarry, from Darkest Night designer Jeremy Lennert, is a deductive combat game. One player is secretly the monster, and their goal is to cripple all of the other players in order to escape the mansion. The other players, the human bounty hunters, must discover and kill the monster before they are hunted down by the creature. Each player moves around the mansion's many rooms to search for clues, gather items, and target other players to deduce which of them is the monster (or, if you are the monster, to wound the other bounty hunters). Tread lightly, for the hunt has begun...<br/><br/>Each round, players take turns moving about the mansion's many rooms, looking at cards for clues, and picking up items (cards) to add to their hand. Players can also interact when in the same room as another player and try to attack them using the cards in their hand in order to deduce who is the monster and what kind of monster they are. If you are the monster, then you want to do your best to avoid being killed and wound the other players in hopes to escape the mansion with your life. Play continues until either the monster is slain or all the other players declare that they have been crippled.<br/><br/>",

Rosencrans faced the Confederate Army of Tennessee, commanded by General Braxton Bragg. Both generals decided to fall on the enemy's left flank, and the confused battle that followed was one of the most desperate and savage of the Civil War. To recreate this fierce encounter, Murfreesboro provides an innovate brigade level simulation that reflects the difficulties involved in moving and fighting on battlefields of the period. Each counter occupies two hexes, and, coupled with rules for leadership, morale, routing, capturing artillery, exhaustion, and ammunition depletion, the game becomes a vivid representation of the actual event.<br/><br/>",

There are six tricks, with the winner gaining positive or negative points for each trick. However, you must play from the last (sixth) trick, followed by the fifth, fourth, etc. until the first trick. Then players resolve tricks from first to sixth according to normal non-trump trick-taking rules.<br/><br/>To add more twist, everyone starts with one &quot;thinking&quot; card. You can play it instead of a regular card on any single trick, then replace it with the remaining card you have in your hand once cards are resolved.<br/><br/>Your score is the absolute value of what you collected, so you want to collect either positives or negatives but not both. A player who didn't take any tricks also scores if they're the only one without a trick.<br/><br/>This game has been called Origin of Falling Water in error.  Just as the word in the Japanese title Rakusuitei is slightly different from the usual Japanese Rakusuiso for &quot;Falling Water&quot;, the decision was made to have a similar pun in English and use &quot;Failing Water&quot; instead of &quot;Falling Water&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With fifty-five sturdy picture/question cards, My First BrainBox is a game that can be used for many years, in many ways. For a very young child each charming illustration can be a springboard to developing fundamental observation skills. If you don&rsquo;t know what to ask, use the questions on the back as your basic starting point. Designed especially for pre-readers, there are no words on the fronts of the cards, just child-friendly images.<br/><br/>The next step would be to have your children study the picture and tell you a story about it. This develops their imagination and logic skills as they strive to make sense of the unknown. Then, as your child matures, he will be ready to develop both his short and long-term memory, so challenge him to recall the details after he has studied a card for ten seconds. A die is rolled, and if your child can answer the corresponding question on the back of the card, the card is his. This will encourage his visual memory and even his auditory processing skills. You know how deficient young children can be in both arenas, and you will hard-pressed to find another program that addresses these needed proficiencies in such an effortless manner.<br/><br/>BrainBox games develop both short and long term memory by challenging children to recall what they saw. Players study a game card for 10 seconds trying to memorize a variety of features. A die is rolled and if the player can answer the corresponding question, the card is his. Play until one child has won a set amount of cards or play until all cards are acquired.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Olix is a 2-player abstract strategy game.<br/><br/>Each player places one piece on the board each turn. Once placed, pieces are never moved nor captured. The board is a simple 11 by 11 square grid.<br/><br/>The players are attempting to form the largest formation in each of the four different types:<br/><br/>    O = A rectangle occupying all exterior spaces of the rectangle (meaning there can be a hole or even filled with a friendly or opposing piece).<br/>    L = An L shaped formation (horizontal and vertical - not diagonal) with each leg having at least 3 spaces.<br/>    I = Any horizontal or vertical line of spaces of at least four spaces long.<br/>    X = Any diagonal line of at least four spaces long.<br/><br/><br/>Adjacent to the board is a scoreboard showing the lowest possible values for each formation:<br/><br/>    O = 4, 6, 8, 9<br/>    L = 5, 6, 7, 8<br/>    I = 4, 5, 6, 7 <br/>    X = 4, 5, 6, 7 <br/><br/><br/>The player with the largest O, L, I, or X, marks its value on the scoreboard. If both players are tied for the largest formation of a type, both mark their scores on the scoreboard.<br/><br/>The game ends when either player has an automatic win or when they concede that no further higher scoring formations can be made. The board should be about 66% full at this point and there simply won't be room for any higher scoring formations to be placed. The winner is the first player to form a formation larger than the scoreboard can handle (an automatic win), or at the end of game, the player who won more scoring columns than their opponent, wins. Ties are broken by the player with the furthest advanced scoring marker.<br/><br/>Originally published in spielbox magazine.<br/><br/>",

However, you can lose points for incorrect answers so before you hit the button you'd better know the answer.

The game was later re-released as the slightly modified Krieg und Frieden (War and Peace) by TM Spiele.  Players are feudal lords that rule their own land and seek to help King Charlemagne build pieces of his castle.  The entire game is made from wood, in a light, clear stain, including the over-sized game board.  Each turn is four seasons, and play continues until all six pieces of the ornate castle are placed.  Players use their resource tiles to bid for that year's agenda, and some resources have more or less value in the bid depending on what type of agenda is available. Then players use their remaining resources to build their lands, sack others' lands, bribe others' knights away from defense, or help to build Charlemagne's castle.  There are slight rules differences between this game and Krieg und Frieden, but mostly a reduction of agenda cards to shorten the game (for the better usually).<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Krieg und Frieden<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fantasy Pug Quest is a non-collectible card game for 1-5 players which lasts about 30-45 minutes for Heroes of age 10+ which will have to cooperate in order to defend their worlds from the conquest of the evil forces menacing them.<br/><br/>Fantasy Pug Quest is inspired by the heroic atmospheres belonging to the first Dungeon &amp; Dragons edition and on tactical combats from JRPG like the very first episodes of Final Fantasy: the will to cooperate and the fraternity spirit which usually bonds adventurers are the main basis of our project!<br/><br/>The players, the brave good-doers pugs struggling to bring peace among the animal races, will have to fight Monster and their Bosses in order to free the Worlds they live in, adapt to their rules, gather Energy to perform incredible Combos, pick up Treasures and share with their party in order to maximize their power and finally save the day!<br/><br/>HOW THE GAME WORKS:<br/>A game of Fantasy Pug Quest is fast and easy!<br/>Starting from the youngest player and continuing clockwise, every player chooses an Hero Ability Card and the corresponding Hero Character Cards are placed on the Gaming Area starting from the Hero with the lowest Initiative value.<br/><br/>Then every player draws as many Energy Cards as shown by the table and a World Card is revealed in order to know which special rules will apply to this game: the World Card also determines where the Monsters will spawn on the Gaming Area.<br/><br/>Everything is ready for the fight and the creature with the highest Initiative value starts the first Turn of the first Round of combat.  Heroes use their Energy Cards to perform as many Combos as they want during their Turns (chosen from those available from their Hero Ability Card); moreover they can perform up to 2 Actions chosen among: Move, Attack, Draw, Discard. The same Action can be performed more than once.<br/><br/>Monsters follow the rules written on their own Cards: one random player will move them and make them perform their attacks during their Turns by simply following such rules.<br/><br/>Are you afraid it is too hard for your small fluffy pug to fight all such scary Monsters? No panic! Your faithful doggo will find precious Treasures on its path and increase its Level in order to unlock new Combos, power up its attacks, cure its wounds and that will definitely help him/her save the day! <br/><br/>The fight goes on until the Heroes are defeated or the Monsters are; first scenario: the game ends.<br/><br/>At the end of each scenario the brave pugs will meet a Pug Merchant so they can buy Treasures or trade their own Energy Cards or loot: collaboration is the key to survive!<br/><br/>Second scenario: the players may go on to the second World and eventually to the third one, the Boss lair.<br/><br/>Bosses have their own special abilities and will represent the hardest enemies for you proud doggos to defeat!<br/><br/>Godspeed you, brave pugs! May the cards be ever in your favor!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Manila '45: Stalingrad of the Pacific (M'45), is a two-player, low-to-intermediate complexity wargame that simulates the American liberation of the capital of the Philippines in World War II, which took place from 3 February to 4 March 1945. To control complexity and present an overall-force-commander's-view of the battle, the game uses a tactically scaled map and units of maneuver coupled with an operationally scaled game turn length. The American player is generally on the offensive, trying to clear the entire Japanese defending force from the city prior to the end of the game.<br/><br/>Each game turn of M'45 equals three days. Each hexagon on the map represents 0.3 miles (0.5 km) from side to opposite side. The units of maneuver in the game are companies, batteries and battalions, representing anywhere from a about 100 to 1,000 men and their equipment.<br/><br/>Historically the Japanese fought to the last man (literally, not metaphorically), and the game's victory conditions represent that brutally absolute mindset. To determine the winner, both players examine the map at the end of Game Turn 10. If at that time there's one or more Japanese units still in play anywhere, the Japanese player is declared to have won the game. If there are no Japanese units left on the map at that time, the US player is declared to have won the game. Of course, if all Japanese units are wiped out prior to the end of the last game turn, play stops and the US player is declared the victor. No draws are possible.<br/><br/>Tacticians will enjoy the fact there are 22 unit types in the game: heavy artillery, heavy anti-aircraft, heavy mortar, heavy rocket artillery, naval infantry (armed ship crews), regular infantry, combat engineers, heavy weapons (machineguns), anti-aircraft, military police, anti-tank, field artillery, rear echelon ad hoc infantry, glider infantry, paratroopers, bridging engineers, mortars, armored cavalry, tanks, self-propelled artillery, amphibious tractors, and self-propelled anti-tank.<br/><br/>",

Napoleon and the French obtained a decisive victory that routed much of the Russian army, which retreated chaotically over the Alle River by the end of the fighting.<br/><br/>The engagement at Friedland was a strategic necessity after the Battle of Eylau earlier in 1807 had failed to yield a decisive verdict for either side. The battle began when Bennigsen noticed the seemingly isolated corps of Marshal Lannes at the town of Friedland. Bennigsen, who planned only to secure his march northward to Wehlau and never intended to risk an engagement against Napoleon's numerically-superior forces, thought he had a good chance of destroying these isolated French units and ordered his entire army over the Alle River. Lannes held his ground against determined Russian attacks until Napoleon could bring additional forces onto the field. Bennigsen could have recalled the Russian forces, numbering about 50,000&ndash;60,000 men, and retreated across the river before the arrival of Napoleon&rsquo;s entire army but, being in poor health, decided to stay at Friedland and took no measures to protect his exposed and exhausted army. By late afternoon, the French had amassed a force of 80,000 troops on the battlefield. Relying on superior numbers, Napoleon concluded that the moment had come and ordered a massive assault against the Russian left flank. The sustained French attack pushed back the Russian army and pressed them against the river behind. Unable to withstand the pressure, the Russians broke and started escaping across the Alle, where an unknown number of them died from drowning. The Russian army suffered horrific casualties at Friedland&ndash;losing over 40% of its soldiers on the battlefield<br/><br/>Originally published by Decision Games (I) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #151, along with Vittoria.<br/><br/>A page of errata was published in S&amp;T #153.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: approximately 1 hour<br/>Hex: approximately .6km<br/>Units: Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters, approximately 100 per game)<br/>One 28-page combined Vittoria/Friedland/Napoleonic Battles System rules booklet<br/><br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Medium<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1-2 Hours<br/><br/>Players will have to provide one 6-sided die<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Every day in Mumbai, the bustling financial capital of India, hot lunches are hand-delivered to employees in workplaces across the city. These home-cooked meals, packed in tins called tiffins or dabbas, are picked up from the customer&rsquo;s home, whisked off by bicycle to a sorting facility, loaded onto carts and wheeled to the train station, loaded onto a train car, unloaded, resorted, routed, and delivered (again, by bicycle) to recipients at work. Each tiffin is carried by multiple dabbawallas (delivery people) along the way. Despite more than 250,000 lunch deliveries every day, mistakes are rare.<br/><br/>In Tiffin, players represent dabbawallas working to deliver tiffins and earn rupees by starting tiffins on a route and contributing to successful delivery of their tiffins and those of other players. The more tiffins delivered on a single route, the higher the payout for each player participating in the deliveries.<br/><br/>Shortcuts speed things up, flat tires slow things down, and an ever-present competitor might get there first. The game ends when all delivery routes are complete and the player with the most rupees is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Publisher Website:<br/><br/>Pathagon is an exciting, ever changing new strategy game of building paths. While Pathagon is quick and easy to learn, there is a depth of strategy that will keep you on your toes. Players take turns placing their wooden game pieces on the board in an attempt to build a path from one side of the game board to the other. There is a &quot;trapping&quot; move that allows a player to &quot;trap&quot; and remove one of their opponents game pieces from the board. The first player to complete the path wins. Sounds simple, doesn't it? The catch is that the two paths cross. Every move has an offensive and defensive consideration. Pathagon is simple enough to be played by children, strategic enough to engage a true gamer. The rules have been drafted so that there is always a winner, no ties, stalemates, or cat's games. Hand crafted from high quality hardwoods, Pathagon is pretty enough to be left out on the coffee table or bookshelf to be played again and again.<br/><br/>",

You can play cards in front of yourself to make 3 piles, or onto your opponents to slow them down if they're ahead of you on the trail. The cards are in different types (colors), canoe, mule, jeep or by foot. If your 3 cards are the same type, you can move the total. If 2 cards match, you can move that total. If the 3 cards don't match, you can move the highest number.<br/><br/>In addition, there are chance tokens laid on the trail face-down. These are revealed as you reach them; the banana is a meal-break (take another move), a lion is danger (fall back to the last village), or a swap tile lets you switch places on the trail with another player.<br/><br/>The player that reaches the mountain first wins, but if the players exhaust their decks, then the furthest along the trail is the winner.<br/><br/>",

As you piece the map together you are drawn into the turbulent times of the Han dynasty in a land of mystical kingdoms. Take the role of the legendary warlords,found in Luo Guanzhong&rsquo;s epic tale, &ldquo;Romance of the Three Kingdoms.&rdquo; Capture lands and build castles to extend and defend your kingdom.<br/><br/>Cartography is a land claiming game with a twist, players become mapmakers in a game that takes creativity and foresight to claim land on a map that changes with each turn. Cartography builds on the ancient territory claiming game &quot;Go&quot; by adding a map-making mechanism. The map is made up of triangular tiles, with rivers that divide the map, allowing lands to be defended or captured. Players create and claim land, then capture opponents, in an effort to control the map.<br/><br/>The map changes as you play so you must keep your wits about you.<br/><br/>Players start by selecting tiles to create land and extend the map.  Castles are then placed on the land you claim or capture, and whoever has most castles &ndash; those they place on the land and those they capture &ndash; wins.  Because the landscape changes on every turn, you must be vigilant as a stronghold can quickly turn into a weakness, and as you try to surround other players&rsquo; castles, they might also be surrounding you! In planning your strategy on where to build your castles, you must carefully choose between expanding and consolidating, and between attacking and defending.<br/><br/>Strategy is key and chance doesn't determine the winner. The 2nd Edition features an alternative play option with an element of luck through random draw of three land tiles kept hidden in your hand.<br/><br/>Cartography is a Social Abstract Game SAG for 2 to 4 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Great Downhill Ski Game is a tile laying game for 1 to 4 skiers, with a large board of white squares, many with green triangles representing pine trees. There are 256 trail tiles showing the parallel lines the skis make in the snow. These go in straight lines, diagonals, turns and sharp turns and a few have 2 trails making crossovers. Players draw ten tiles from the face-down pile and show them. The first player lays as many tiles as possible to make a ski trail down from the top of the hill avoiding the trees, then draws back to ten tiles. A player may choose to use its turn to swap tiles with the pool instead of playing. If your trail is totally blocked, you may remove tiles laid and try again. <br/>When a skier reaches the bottom of the hill, the others may finish their turns. Any finisher gets 25 bonus points, then each player scores their trail, according to the tiles they laid. The straights are worth 1 point, turns 2 pts, sharp turns 3 pts and crossovers are 10 pts. Then deduct the tiles left in hand and the highest total wins.<br/>In the solitaire game, the player draws 50 tiles and tries to make a trail using all 50.<br/><br/>The rules are in English, French and German and refer to the board as a plastic sheet rolled in a tube, presumably the earlier edition. A slip in the box has trademark Terry Martin Rose and a company address Franklin Merchandising Co in Chicago.<br/><br/>Nancy Greene (1943 - ) is Canada's most famous skier and it was not a surprise when her name and picture was added to the Canadian version.<br/><br/>The Waddingtons edition must have been produced after the tube edition, as the rules text refers to unfurling the plastic sheet although the game has a standard board. The box has a copyright date of 1970. The tile count is different from the enclosed slip too, with 4 more straights, and 2 fewer of each hairpin turn.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

However, tours are expensive and risky. The risk may be mitigated by cooperating with others, but then players must split the spoils, so band members must earn their place or be left out.<br/><br/>Early in players&rsquo; career, tours are niche; poorly promoted with obscure genres &amp; unusual instruments (bagpipe reggae?). As the game progresses, players gain success by selling out to more mainstream music and learning how to do effective marketing. As their careers take off, the incentive to cooperate with other players fades away, leaving nothing but a desperate race for fans.<br/><br/>Previously called: Battle of the Bands and Band Manager: Backstage Clash<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Step-by-step strategy for two players<br/>There are four armies inside the box, the armies of the North, West, East, and South. There are 17 units in each army, but the armies have a different balance of strength. This affects the tactics and allows you to have a new experience every time you play.<br/><br/>Each unit card has a picture of a warrior, which can be either on foot or horse. There are also numbers of the attack strength and counter-attack strength. Players will compare these two to decide the outcome of a fight.<br/><br/>Players put out a battle field that consists of 3 columns and 4 rows. Now everything is ready for battle.<br/><br/>How to play?<br/>The first player takes the top card from his army reserve and he leads it out onto the battlefield into one of the three cells of the first row. The unit is marching out of camp and joining battle. The unit comes out of camp and activates the unit in front. It displaces one of its comrades, that unit is activated and so on, until a unit comes into contact with the enemy. If a unit moves into an enemy cell, then the units start combat.<br/><br/>For this we compare the attack strength of the attacker with the counterattack strength of the defender. The unit with the larger number is the winner of the round. The losing unit leaves the battlefield and is put into the discard pile, where it will remain until the end of the game, it cannot enter the battlefield again.<br/><br/>Then it is opponent's move. He goes through the same steps. He draws the top card of his army reserve and decides on the cell it will occupy.<br/><br/>Who wins?<br/>1. If we lead all of our units out onto the battlefield and there are no more reserve cards available, then the game is over. The winner is determined by the number of units still remaining on the field. The player with the most units wins.<br/>2. If a unit manages to cross the edge of the battlefield on the enemy side, we call this a break into the enemy camp and the game stops immediately, and the player who managed to break through wins immediately<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The Kingdom of Raul fears for the fate and safety of Emperor Hal, who has disappeared without a trace on a hunting trip in the Bornland. While the heir apparent, Brin of Gareth, searches for his father, discord is sown in the capital city by the influential noble Answin in a bid for the throne. The orcs in the Middle Kingdom plot to make haste and take advantage of this prime opportunity! Thousands pour forth, warlike in their midnight furs, from Orkland and scour the country with fire and death. Desperately, Prince Brin gathers his remaining followers to face the hordes of the Aikar Brazoragh, the chief chosen by the Ork gods, on the battlefield. While the third Orc invasion rages in Aventuria, the cards to power and prestige will be reshuffled in the glamorous Gareth capital city. Here the adventure begins!<br/><br/>In Orkensturm, the players take on the roles of those who have stayed behind in the Imperial City of Gareth. Will you choose to support Emperor Answin, the Usurper or the Rightful Heir to the throne, Brin of Gareth? Will Prince Brin succeed in routing the orcs and return home victorious from the battlefield? Or will he perish in battle, Answin remaining the only hope of the Middle Kingdom as a strong ruler? Which of them triumphs is uncertain, because the orc invasion has many possible outcomes. The players can exert their influence to support one of the factions &mdash; with direct effects on the end of the story.<br/><br/>Orkensturm is a board game for 3-8 players, age 14 and above, with more than 200 cards, eight different colored tiles sets and a large game board with illustrations from the World of the Black Eye by artist Nadine Sch&auml;kel.<br/><br/>",

They visit a bustling pirate tavern to seek out able bodied sailors to join their crew and fill their ragged ranks.  But Avast!  Other Captains who survived the battle have made port as well and are also looking to hire on crewmembers of their own.  Players must bid on sailors looking to sign to a new ship, carefully build out their crew, undermine the efforts of their fellow Captains, and avoid getting plundered themselves as they attempt to get their ship manned and ready to set sail.<br/><br/>'All Hands on Deck!' is card game centered around an auction/trick taking mechanic.  Players blind bid to attempt to win sailors that are turned over on the top of the deck, using the numbered value of different cards they already have in their hand as bidding capital.  There are ten different pirate ranks in each of three 'suits' that represent pirates from three crews that returned to port without their Captain.  Players leverage the cards in their hand they don't need to try and win cards at auction that will help them build a winning hand.  They must be careful, however, as other players will use the many different action cards in the deck to try to influence the bidding process to their own ends, offering rum bribes, drowning available pirates, or even luring them to their demise with the deadly song of a mermaid!  The first player to build a winning pirate crew shouts 'ALL HANDS ON DECK!' and proves themselves the craftiest Captain in these waters.<br/><br/>The game contains 108 cards, a Rulebook, and loads of pirate attitude.<br/><br/>",

Using their Fightin&rsquo;, Flyin&rsquo;, and Thinkin&rsquo; skills they attempt to successfully complete these Events to earn Credits and Honor. If the players run out of Credits or Honor before the end of the game, they all lose. If the players manage to complete enough Events without running out of Credits or Honor, they win the game and live to fly another day!<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>Double sized Character Cards &ndash; Contains the Character&rsquo;s Skill numbers and special abilities<br/><br/>Event Cards &ndash; These are the Events the players must overcome to win the game.<br/><br/>Serenity Cards &ndash; These are dual use cards. The main use is to help the players overcome Events. It&rsquo;s secondary use is to determine random numbers.<br/><br/>Alliance Cards &ndash; These are penalty cards that are drawn if the players do not do well at certain Events. Draw too many of these and the players lose the game even if they still have Credits and Honor.<br/><br/>Gorramit Cards &ndash; These cards modify the Events, generally making them harder.<br/>A Set of Rules &ndash; The rules to the game.<br/>Honor Tokens &ndash; These are used to track the player&rsquo;s Honor.<br/>Credit Tokens &ndash; These are used to track the player&rsquo;s Credits.<br/><br/>The Character Cards each represent one of the main Characters in Firefly. In addition to having their skills values listed, Each Character has special abilities, which cost a variable amount of Credits or Honor. On a players turn he can choose to spend Credits or Honor on one of these abilities, but it brings them closer to losing, so they need to think about whether they really need to or not.<br/><br/>A typical turn of the game consists of the active player turning over the top Event card. Each Event card has three challenges, one Fightin&rsquo;, one Flyin&rsquo;, and one Thinkin&rsquo;. Each of these has a number, which the players must equal or exceed  to be successful in the challenge. Characters gain skill two different ways, they may play Serenity cards to gain skill, and, after playing their Serenity cards, they add a random number to determine their final skill. This is added to the Character&rsquo;s base skill number listed on their Character cards. Depending on how many challenges they successfully complete they either gain or lose Credits and/or Honor. The more successful the more they gain.<br/><br/>Once the event is resolved, the next player starts a new turn, and turns over the next Event card. The game is over once all the Event cards have been drawn and resolved.<br/>    <br/>The Firefly TV show is about surviving with honor. Mal and his crew are continually trying to scrounge up enough credits to keep flying, while maintaining their own personal sense of honor. The game reflects this grand theme with the victory conditions, survive the Event deck without running out of Honor or Credits.  Each Event in the deck is tied to an episode in the show, and is easily recognizable by fans of the show. The Skills needed for each Event are tied to action of the episode featured on the card. A sub theme of the show is escaping notice of the Alliance, and again, with the inclusion of the Alliance deck, Firefly: Out to the Black delivers. The Alliance deck is an ever-present threat looming over the players as they desperately seek to finish the Events in the game.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a  still tennis player figure which is used to volley the ball back and forth across the net.  Under each player, and under the translucent surface of the board is the movement paddle for that player, which dictates how far the playing figure could move for the subsequent turn.  The game field is set up just like a tennis court, with the requisite lines and a net, and the players volley a soft tufted &quot;tennis ball&quot;.  One player serves the ball, and if it lands within the fair territory, the receiving player checks to see if it fell within their movement paddle space.  That player then moves the center of their paddle under the ball and uses their figure to return the ball, and so on until one player scores by their opponent knocking the ball out of play, or by playing the ball in a space where their opponent cannot reach it within their movement zone.  All of the ball volleying is performed by tensing back the racket of the playing figure, and then releasing it to launch the ball across the net.  Scoring is handled just like regular tennis scoring.<br/><br/>",

In alphabetical order, players place their card adjacent to a card on the table to create or extend a row or column of letters. You must then say a word that starts with the letters in this row or column. If you extend a row and a column at the same time, you must say a word for the row and a word for the column. Once five or more rows/columns consist of at least two connected cards, you may place a letter only if you extend the length of a row or column to three cards or more.<br/><br/>If you cannot place a letter card because you can't create a word, then you must remove all cards from the longest row or column and add half of these cards to your hand. (Set the other cards aside as a penalty pile.) If you still can't place a letter in order to create a word, you must remove another word, etc.<br/><br/>If you place a letter card and connect separate areas of the grid &mdash; which were separated due to someone needing to remove a word &mdash; then you discard one of your penalty cards.<br/><br/>Typo 2D includes icons on some cards that can be used for variants, such as a card that can replace another card or a card you must place behind an empty spot and &quot;fill in&quot; the empty spot by saying a word.<br/><br/>",

It's a card game that not only celebrates procrastination &mdash; it rewards you for it!<br/><br/>In Future Me Problems, the goal of the game is to earn as many points as you can by collecting valuable distraction cards from the activity deck and avoiding penalty-giving responsibility cards. Players accomplish this by planning out their turns using schedule cards. Schedule cards let you do things like draw cards from the activity deck, flip the activity deck over, and even force other players to draw cards from the activity deck.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the dreaded Large, Important Task card is placed in the center of the activity deck. Whoever is forced to draw that card will receive a big penalty and end the game! When that happens, everyone adds up their points and the player with the most points from collected activity cards wins the game.<br/><br/>Future Me Problems is based on the popular web comic Sarah&rsquo;s Scribbles, by Sarah Andersen.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Bridge to Treasure Cave', first released as Die Br&uuml;cke am Rio D'Oro, is old and brittle &ndash; no, not the game itself, but the bridge that spans the river, the bridge that connects explorers to the treasure cave on the other side of the gorge.<br/><br/>But who will be first to cross this dangerous path? Players must exercise the highest level of caution because a rotten plank of wood in the bridge might break at any time, causing the player &ndash; or worse, some of the precious treasure &ndash; to plunge into the gorge. What's more, the other treasure hunters will be only too glad to pilfer your finds should you give them the chance.<br/><br/>The goal in The Bridge to Treasure Cave is to cross the bridge (a 3D structure inside the box), grab the treasure and cross the bridge again to return the treasure to your camp. On your turn, you roll a number of dice to determine how far you move. Each die face shows how far you must move and possibly some event:<br/><br/>     Danger, which adds another die roll which may cause the bridge to (partly) collapse at your location, or may cause you to lose a treasure;<br/>     Repair, which allows you to repair a damaged part of the bridge;<br/>     Pilfer, which allows you to steal a treasure from another player, if you land on his location.<br/><br/><br/>There are three dice: a green die, which in general permits only slow, but safe movement, a yellow die, which gives a good chance to pilfer treasure, and a red die, which allows for fast, but risky movement. The number of treasures you are carrying determines how many dice you may roll: the more treasures you carry, the fewer dice you roll. After rolling, you select one die to execute.<br/><br/>If you reach the treasure cave, you can immediately claim up to three treasures. If you reach your camp, you may unload your treasures and prepare for the next crossing. If you end your move at a gap in the bridge, or if the bridge collapses under you, any treasures you are carrying are lost in the river, and you return to your base camp.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the cave holds 25 treasures. The first player to carry a certain number of treasures (depending on the number of players) back to his camp wins. Alternatively, if no player has acquired that number of treasures before all treasures have been claimed or lost in the river, the player who has collected the most treasures wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a sheep station, consisting of 5 Natural Pasture paddocks, fully stocked with 3 'pens' of sheep per paddock. Throughout the game players will earn money by buying and selling their sheep as well as from selling wool once per 'year' (circulation of the board) at the 'Wool sale' space. Players will spend this money to Improve and Irrigate their pastures. As players make their way around the board they will encounter many challenges and face the tribulations of Australian farmers including treating Foot Rot, being injured by a tractor and most devastating of all, droughts. The game ends once one player has Irrigated all of their pastures and stocked each of them with 6 pens of sheep, 30 pens in total, becoming the most successful farmer and winning the game.<br/><br/>The game has no player elimination element and everyone stays in the game until the end.<br/><br/>Squatter is a quintessential Australian game, becoming an icon of Australian culture and a staple in many Australian homes since it's release at the Royal Melbourne Show in 1962 on the Australian Wool Bureau stand. Squatter has sold over 500,000 copies and is the most successful board game ever developed in Australia.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Subtitle: Six Bridges: The Battle of Pittsburgh, October 1, 1863<br/><br/>It was early September 1863 &amp; Gen. Robert E. Lee was perplexed. He'd smashed the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg, then chewed up its remnants as it tried to defend Washington, captured that city, though much of it was burned in the process, and came within card throw of bagging both Lincoln &amp; Grant. But instead of gaining the Confederacy the ultimate victory Lee had sought when he began that risky campaign, the fall of Washington served only to radicalize &amp; galvanize the North.<br/><br/>Lincoln has sailed to Boston to set up a new US capital. He declined the 'offer of mediation toward peace' extended by the ambassadors of Great Britain &amp; France. London &amp; Paris soon recognized the Confederacy - the government of which now housed in the charred &amp; bullet-pocked city of Washington, DD (that is, the District of Dixie!), and announced they would join the war to secure its independence.<br/><br/>But then, before Union &amp; Anglo-French naval vessels even exchanged their first broadsides, the Prussians made their move, declaring for the Union &amp; launching strong attacks into France &amp; Bavaria. That led the Austrians; ever jealous and fearful their Prussian cousins were aiming to supplant their primacy in the Germanic world, to throw in with France. Then the Czar mobilized his millions of newly emancipated serfs, creating the largest single army yet seen on the planet, leading them in an attack on Vienna.<br/><br/>With the CSA, Britain, France &amp; Austria on one side, fighting the USA, Prussia &amp; Russia on the other, World War I began in August 1863. &quot;Home Before the Leaves Fall&quot; was the cry heard across the northern hemisphere.<br/><br/>Lee convinced Jefferson Davis to reinforce him by shifting troops fromBragg;'s Army to create a 4th Corps for the Army of Northern Virginia. Comprised of Tennessee men &amp; recruits from the new Confederate state of Maryland, Gen. Pat Cleburne was picked to run it. Lee intended to use the new Corps as a screen for his next offensive.<br/><br/>With the fall of Vicksburg, &amp; Port Hudson, Lee reasoned Gen.Sherman would move east to relieve the Union's fortunes. If he could intercept Sherman &amp; destroy his army before it linked with Grant's, the war would surely end. Scanning his maps, Lee determined Pittsburgh was the key. If he controlled it, he would sever the only east / west rail line left to the Union. It was also the perfect place to meet the British (actually Anglo-Canadian) Expeditionary Force forming in Canada for a crossing of Lake Erie.<br/><br/>Lee sent an outline of his plan to the Commander of the BEF, Sir Patrick Macdougall, who was highly receptive, sending a reply in which he promised to rendezvous with lee at Pittsburgh on or around October 1.<br/><br/>Until 14 September, Grant &amp; Lincoln had assumed Lee's next move would be in the Northeast. On that day a minister of the Canadian government, a strong abolition man, defected with a copy of the Confederate general's letter. After much debate, the two US war leaders convinced themselves the document was authentic &amp; set about to counter Lee's plan. The 3rd Corps was left to defend the Susquehanna River line, in case they were wrong, and a telegram was sent to Sherman instructing him to move to Pittsburgh as quickly as possible.<br/><br/>By the 17th, when Lee began marching northeast towards Pittsburgh, Grant had already stolen a day's march on him. The question became who would get to the city first to meet Lee &amp; Grant: the BEF, shuttling across Lake Erie then marching down the western borderlands of Pennsylvania, or Sherman, coming up the Ohio valley. Neither Grant nor Lee knew who would be reinforced first or exactly when, but both understood there would be a savage fight for Pittsburgh.

With multiple rules variants, you can always adjust the game to your liking as you create movie scenarios. Everyone can play, you just need wild imagination! Is your script good enough to become a cult classic?<br/><br/>With its unique art style and gameplay, B-Movies will gather around the table players and non players. Everyone at the table will have fun pitching and judging on the best B-Movies.<br/><br/>No dull moment with more than a hundred cards with unique and deeply thematic artwork! From Ghost Piranhas in Space to Time Travelling Brain Collectors, create your very own B-Movie scenario. Only one rule: be creative!<br/><br/>Key Points:<br/>- A party game everyone can have fun with.<br/>- Unique theme and artwork which takes you deep into the heart of B-Movies.<br/>- You're in the directors chair!<br/><br/>How to play:<br/>- 3 players: 5 rounds<br/>- 4 players: 4 rounds<br/>- 5+ players: 3 rounds<br/><br/>Pitches:<br/>During a player's turn, they are a Screenwriter, using the cards in their hand (2-4 cards) to pitch a movie idea to all of the other players, who are called Producers. The player have to come up with a title for the movie they are pitching and convinced the other players to produce the movie.<br/><br/>Now, the Producers individually decide whether to vote for the movie to be made or to vote against it being made by putting a Vote card (yes, yes!, no) facedown. Once all Producers have revealed their Vote cards the votes are tallied. Here are the possible results:<br/><br/>- No: If there are No votes greater than the number of Yes votes, the movie is not made. The Screenwriter discards all of the cards in the movie.  All players that voted No now draw 1 Popcorn each and place it facedown in their play area.<br/><br/>- Yes(Yes! Tokens count as 1 Yes vote): If there are Yes votes greater than or equal to the number of No votes the movie is being produced! The Screenwriter gathers up all of the title cards in their movie and places them in order in a pile in front of them, making sure to keep it separate from their other movies. All Producers that revealed a Yes <br/>Vote card, now draw 1 Popcorn token and place it facedown in front of them. All Producers that revealed a Yes! Vote card, now draw 1 Popcorn token for each Title card in the Screenwriter&rsquo;s movie pitch.<br/><br/>Regardless of the outcome of the vote, all players that voted Yes! remove their Vote card from the game. All other players return their Vote cards to their play area facedown.<br/><br/>Final Cut (end of the game):<br/>All players now total their final score. Players turn all of their Popcorn tokens faceup, gain points equal to the sum of their Popcorn tokens and also gain 1 point for each card in their movies that were made. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Desperados is a partnership game where players in teams of two must work together to get the most points. In Reiner Knizia's first published game, there are nine mine-opening cards and nine mine-closing cards.  To score any points you've got to play gold, silver or copper cards onto the corresponding open mine and then close it.  Trouble is, your opponents can close your mine before you want or even try to steal it with bandit cards -- a tough gauntlet to run, but here and there a few points trickle through and into the scoring column.  On your turn you either play a card OR draw a card -- not both -- making this rapid-fire card game move at its own special pace, which is very quickly indeed. It was designed primarily for partnership play, and appreciated best by players with good partnership skills. For players who do not want a partnership experience, there are variations for 2 or 3 players.<br/><br/>Originally published as Digging by Hexagames in 1990 (Later by Avalanche Press with new pictures on the cards and a trivial rules tweak). Released as Desperados in 2009 by Eagle-Gryphon Games.<br/><br/>",

It was one of the largest battles of the Hellenistic kingdoms of the Diadochi and was waged to determine the sovereignty of Coele Syria.<br/><br/>Raphia was technically designed as a Standard Combat Series (SCS) game.  However, only a small subset of the SCS rules are needed for play. If you are familiar with usual wargame movement (what an MP is, how units count movement, etc), stacking, step loss, and retreat conventions, there is no need to review the SCS rulebook itself (not included, but will be referenced in the links section).<br/><br/>Players take turns moving their units and conducting ranged combat and melee until the victory conditions are reached.<br/><br/>A player wins Raphia by being the first to move one of their Phalanx units into the enemy home tent.  If all Phalanxes are destroyed before either player wins, the result is a draw.<br/><br/>Raphia is one of the games included in Multi-Man Publishing's (MMP) Special Ops magazine Issue #1 (Summer 2011).<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 11 x 17&quot; full-color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheets (140 1/2&quot; counters though only 130 are used for the game)<br/>One 4-page rule booklet<br/><br/>",

To prepare for play, group all the stuff on the table into five groups. Give each single snack a value depending on the calories, after which each player adds a secret value modifier and the game starts. On a turn, take exactly one piece more or less than the previous player or steal from anyone's unsaved snacks. In the end, players reveal the modifiers and count their score.<br/><br/>Futterneid can be played as a &quot;normal&quot; game without real snacks, but the game comes packaged with five snack bowls and bears a universal &quot;add snacks as achievements to any game&quot; rule, so why not indulge?<br/><br/>",

Wise rulers had always reigned over them, and thanks to this everyone lived in prosperity. Even so, some had rebelled against the binding order, ignoring the venerable customs and breaking the law...<br/><br/>You are one of those renegades and &quot;enemies of the kingdom&quot;, but you now have a second chance for freedom as this land's ruler prophesized that among you there is a chosen one who in the future will affect the fate of the desert lands. He decided that a trial in an ancient labyrinth would resolve who would be released and who would see daylight no more. The corridors of the labyrinth are winding and bristle with cleverly planned and dangerous pitfalls. Tales and legends also mention a guard, an immortal Golem that tramps the stone corridors.<br/><br/>Labyrinth: The Paths of Destiny 2 ed. is an adventure board game for 2-6 players who impersonate both the great constructors of the ancient labyrinth and the daredevils who try to escape.<br/><br/>To find a way out of the labyrinth, each player must find a special key while avoiding traps from other players, not to mention the Golem. With their two actions each turn, players can construct the multi-level labyrinth, set traps, move, rest, attack other players and much more.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Atoll is a two player connection game played on a hexagonally tessellated board.  The board is surrounded by eight &quot;islands&quot; of stones, alternating between black islands and white islands going around the board.  Black must connect two black islands on opposite sides of the board with a contiguous chain of black stones.  The islands themselves can be part of the chain.  So for example, Black could form one bridge between his North and West islands and a second bridge between his West and South islands to win.  Likewise for White and the white islands.<br/><br/>Like Hex, a completely filled-in board must result in a winning connection for exactly one of the two players.<br/><br/>Atoll could be characterised as a generalisation of Hex where the number of islands is eight rather than four. A generalized Atoll can be played with any multiple of four islands.<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/>     Yucata (turn-based)<br/><br/><br/>",

The players also have a &quot;Code Row&quot; of five cards which represents their launch code.

Each of these has a different effect depending on the matching Zener cards turned over and used.<br/><br/>To win the game, a player must either correctly guess each Zener card in the opponent's Code Row, or deal enough psychic damage to the opponent to move that player's life counter to zero.<br/><br/>",

They form two teams and with the help of a garden hose that they place under a fence, the gnomes organize a Tug-of-War. They shout, moan, swear, and insult each other. Sweat streams down in large drops from under their gnomish hats. They try to pull together at the fence. Squirrels from the neighborhood hurry to gather there. They can&rsquo;t sleep with all the noise and they gather at the garden's edge in order to watch the spectacle.<br/><br/>Garden dwarves make a &quot;pull the rope&quot; competition. During his turn, each player plays a card which allows him to add a dwarf of a certain color on his side of the rope or to make dwarves of a particular color stronger (or weaker). When dwarves are actually pulling the rope, you slide a part of the cute little board.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, she rolls the die, then takes a seaside card of that color, flips it over to reveal the rocks on the other side, then places it in a path leading from the island. If on a future turn, she rolls a color that's already in her path, instead of adding another tile to her path, her sheep crosses a number of rocks equal to the number of rocks of the rolled color in her path. Whoever first reaches her ship with her sheep wins!<br/><br/>",

The cards themselves are the &quot;playing pieces,&quot; and movement is measured out in real space on any flat surface.<br/>​<br/>Inspired by Herman Melville's famous literary nemeses, one player controls the fearsome Moby Dick and a pod of whales, using hidden movement to elude the opponent, who controls the whaling fleet of Ahab and his crew. Moby Dick prevails by destroying the whaleship Pequod, while Ahab won't rest until the white whale of his nightmares is slain.<br/>​<br/>Leviathan offers players a simple set of rules but a rich wargame flavor in about 15 minutes and is highly portable. This is a great piece of introductory level naval combat for both new and experienced gamers across the age spectrum, and a wonderful homage to two of literature's most notorious monsters.<br/><br/>",

Your fellow hunters may be tempted to steal from you, ending the hunt sooner than you might expect. At the end of the day, captured cards score points for you, but hunters who are caught during the closed season and cards that remain in your hand will reduce your score.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a hand of one hunter, two wolves, three rabbits, three carrots and one closed season/carrot. On a turn, each player secretly chooses a card from his hand, then they reveal the cards simultaneously. If someone played a &quot;closed season&quot; card, than all hunters played are placed in the prey pile of those players. If not, hunters each capture a wolf (starting with the &quot;Hunt starts here&quot; card and going clockwise), place that card in their prey pile, then return their hunter to their hand; any hunter that can't capture a wolf is placed under its owner's hunting lodge (a play area in front of each player).<br/><br/>If any wolves remain, they each capture a rabbit (again starting with the &quot;Hunt starts here&quot; card and going clockwise) and are then placed in the &quot;easy prey&quot; section of that player's hunting lodge; if a wolf doesn't catch a rabbit, return it to its owner's hand. Rabbits are handled the same as wolves, but they hunt carrots (and not themselves!), moving to &quot;easy prey&quot; if they eat and returning to their owner's hand otherwise. Cards in a player's &quot;easy prey&quot; section are captured before a similar card played by that same player during the current turn; if a card is not captured while in the &quot;easy prey&quot; section, it's moved to that player's prey pile at the end of the next turn.<br/><br/>If everyone still has at least one card in hand, move the &quot;Hunt starts here&quot; card one space clockwise and play another turn. If at least one player has no cards in hand, each player scores their prey pile, with hunters worth -4 points and all other cards worth 1-4 points. Players then reclaim their cards and play another round. After four complete rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The simulation encompasses the entire world and all the areas of warfare - on and under the seas, in the air, on land, and in the factory.<br/><br/>Economic warfare plays a vital role in Global War. The Axis submarines attempt to put a stanglehold on England, isolating it from the rest of the Commonwealth and America. German surface raiders sortie into the North Atlantic in an attempt to cut American lend-lease en route to Russia. The industries must be tooled-up before production. It is impossible to suddenly switch from producing submarines to producing tanks. Players must decide early in the game what type of war they are going to conduct. A wrong guess at this stage could mean the difference between victory and defeat.

There are four themed neighborhoods within the facility, and each player is responsible for constructing the attractions in one of those neighborhoods: Animal Kingdom, Tour America, Sky World, and Foreign Lands. Each turn represents the passage of one week.<br/><br/>During the game, players draw cards representing purchase orders (POs) for different types of attractions. These cards have two uses: first, as POs approved by the finance office to expedite construction of specific types of attractions each turn, and second, as the actual financing to construct the attraction represented on the card. At the end of each month, the review board meets, evaluates the progress of each neighborhood, and awards bonuses for meeting a set of predetermined preferences. These preferences relate to how attractions in a park are arranged. Points are awarded to the players who meet the review board's preferences.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the owners of the facility come in and award points to the finished themed neighborhoods. These points are awarded based on four criteria:<br/><br/><br/>    Excitement Level &mdash; size of the rides<br/>    Parking Lot View &mdash; curb appeal to visitors upon arrival<br/>    Main Entrance View &mdash; attractiveness to patrons waiting in line for their tickets<br/>    Themed Attractions &mdash; number of matched types of attractions in a neighborhood<br/><br/><br/>The player who earns the most points wins the design contract for the owners' next project.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lost in Time is a thematic game centering around time travel with three sets of rules that allow for different ways of play. The game consists of 88 cards with beautiful historical illustrations.<br/><br/>The first version of the game is light and easy, specifically designed for children ages 10 and up. It's the year 2031: you are one of the very first time travelers and you have been sent to the past. However, your time machine does not work as it was supposed to (isn't that typical!) and you are left stranded in the past. Now you have to get back to the year 2031. The player who is the closest to the year 2031 after the eighth leap wins! Each game round the players must place a card on their timeline but the problem is: not everybody will want to travel to the future like you do, some will want to jump to the past. And if you can't place anything on your timeline, you run the risk of being absorbed by the vortex. It's a tug-of-war in time &amp; space. Duration of play: 20 to 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The second version, The Time Bandits, is semi-cooperative and lets the players choose between being the secret agents or the thieves. The thieves, sent to the past by a criminal organization, must collect four historical artifacts before the eighth card has been played &mdash; without being caught by the agents. These agents have been hired &amp; vigourously trained by the government to hunt the criminals down throughout the centuries before they end up changing the past and thus also automatically...the future. All players receive a deck of 18 cards which represent their time machine's battery allowing them to conjure up a wormhole in order to jump into time. The players must keep a close eye on the level of their battery: if it's empty, they will not be able to jump in time anymore and they will end up Lost in Time. In this version, the players are allowed to take items with them in their backpack to help save their skin if they end up in a historical disaster (Battle of the Somme or Eruption of the Vesuvius...). Both the agents and thieves can also make use of famous historical characters (Elizabeth I, Napoleon or Lenin...) to help them stop their rivals! If a players ends up in a period within the influence of a historical character who is allied to his rival, he will be in serious trouble! Duration of play: 30 to 40 minutes.<br/><br/>The third version is a solo variant. An attack has been made on your lab, and you've managed to escape in the &quot;nick of time&quot; by opening up a vortex and jumping in. You are a lonesome chrononaut with only one objective: get back to the year 2031 and prevent the attack on the lab. Before traveling to the past, you must decide how many batteries (deck of cards) to bring along. Every leap in time costs an amount of energy and even moreso if you end up in a period of disaster. When your batteries are empty, you are stuck in time, so you must be economical with your available energy! Will you jump in time immediately and save your battery, or will you press your luck and spend more energy in order to find a data chip that will help your travel through time more easily? Duration of play: 15 to 20 minutes.<br/><br/>Can you survive the past?<br/><br/>",

Each player starts the game with one location, and cards in the deck consist of attackers, defenders, locations and support cards. To start a turn, you draw two cards, pick up any cards banked from a previous turn, and take the three cards passed to you earlier by the player on your left. You play or bank cards until you have only three in hand, then pass those to the player on your right and end your turn.<br/><br/>Attackers target specific locations and earn points for the player wielding them if they're in play at the end of the game. Defenders try to remove attackers so that the location owner scores points for protecting the location. Support cards provide different abilities, such as enlarging your bank or providing time points (which can be used to draw additional cards). Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins!<br/><br/>Doctor Who: The Card Game &ndash; Classic Doctor Edition can be combined with Doctor Who: The Card Game.<br/><br/>",

And now, they have descended on our planet looking for new games wherever they can find them. On a seemingly innocent and charming little farm, the Odynauts are witness to a high stakes strategic game in which hens are the coveted prize. The roosters seek to draw as many of them in as possible with their charms. A sly fox is sneaking around the coop for a delicious meal, while the farmer is on a mission to catch him in order to protect his precious little hens.  The Odynauts, of course, see a highly entertaining game in all of this. Are you the biggest, baddest rooster? Or are you just the smartest one?<br/><br/>Rule the Roost (a.k.a. Hennen Jennen) is a funny and nerve-racking farm-themed card game for two to four witty players of all ages. The goal is to become the leader Rooster of one or more barns and to collect as many chickens as possible for points.<br/><br/>Throughout the game each player tries to obtain a majority in one or more of the three barns with her own rooster cards by placing these cards under the barn cards. For each barn in which a player has the majority of roosters at the end of the game, she receives one point for each of the chicken cards present. Players should try to have as many chickens as possible in the barns in which she dominates by either placing her own chicken cards there, or by banking on others doing so.<br/><br/>But beware! Danger is lurking. Players can prevent an opponent from having the majority of roosters in a barn or collecting chickens in a barn by throwing eggs, playing fox cards or famer cards because foxes have chickens on the menu and the farmer is eager to move roosters from one barn to another.<br/><br/>",

If the game does not end after the Struggle, each player discards down to 3 cards and then the discard pile and Minion deck are shuffled together.  The Supremacy Card passes to the next player and a new Day begins.<br/><br/>Players score points based on the placement of their Markers within the Districts.  The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The title of First to Fight refers to the famous slogan and poster distributed in European countries after Poland was the first country to be attacked by Germany in September 1939. This game, released by Fabryka Gier Historycznych (Historical Games Factory)in cooperation with Fundacja Niepodległości (Foundation for Independence), takes place throughout the entirety of World War II, with the players taking the roles of commanders of the Polish forces that are fighting on numerous fronts: Eastern and Western Europe, Africa, etc. By allocating their troops in different regions of the world, they aim to carry out missions (including the most famous battles of WW2) and earn victory points (VPs). The players do not &quot;own&quot; or control the soldiers, which are represented by neutral cards, moved by the players around the board, and activated only when it is the time to play a mission card in a given region; that said, their particular specialization may increase a player's chance to win a mission. The player with the most VPs at the end of the War (May 1945) wins.<br/><br/>The game presents true historical characters, events and places. First to Fight shows the scale of various activities that took place during the war &ndash; but it is not a wargame. Over its 40-70 minute playing time, a player will get to know many people and places that played an important role in achieving the victory over Germany. Among the soldiers to command, you can find Antoni Chruściel ps. Monter, August Emil Fieldorf ps. Nil, Jan Kozielewski ps. Jan Karski, Zdzisław Jeziorański ps. Jan Nowak, Stanisław Maczek ps. Baca, Jan Piwnik ps. Ponury, Zofia Rapp-Kochańska ps. Marie Springer, Stanisław Skalski, Elżbieta Zawacka ps. Zo, Witold Urbanowicz ps. Kobra. In order to win the game, you will have to train your soldiers and send them to various fronts &ndash; from the cold regions of Northern Europe, through the sun-baked deserts of Northern Africa and peaceful (only in theory!) Western Europe, to Warsaw, always fighting to the last bullet and the last soldier! All characters and events presented in the game were real.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The kingdom's most celebrated warriors have come from far and wide to do combat in a grand tournament that will determine who is the fiercest of them all. Each has a personal reason for competing in the event, but there is a single thread that unites all of them: the desire to put their fighting skills on display in order to earn the right to be called champion.<br/><br/>Sainome Colosseum R is an ultra-accessible and fast-paced PvP combat game for 2-4 players that allows players to take on chosen character roles, each with an assortment of individual skills and abilities, to do battle with one another in an epic gladiatorial showdown. Using action selection, hand management, card drafting, and dice rolling, Sainome Colosseum R gives players important decision points while blending strategy, luck, and balanced replayability. As you explore the game, you discover the strengths and weaknesses of each fighter as well as interesting combinations that can put your opponents down for the count.<br/><br/>On each turn, a player chooses two out of five actions, resolves both, then discards to meet the hand limit requirements. To gain the advantage in battle, gear can be attached to your character by physically placing equipment cards on any side of your fighter with a corresponding slot. These equipment cards can then activated using a unique dice mechanism to attack your opponents and initiate a wide range of special effects. Adding further to this dynamic gameplay is the ability for each character to transform from their beginning Normal Form to a heightened Awakened Form, which grants skill upgrades. The player who best utilizes these various systems to reduce their opponent's HP to 0 is ultimately the winner!<br/><br/>",

They also roll a randomizer die which tells them how many re-rolls they are allowed.  Once they're finished, they construct a hand (e.g. flush: 1-2-5-9-K) and mark one of the 16 tracking cells on the board with their color pegs.  They may also usurp someone else's claimed cell if their poker hand is of higher rank (hence the need to meticulously mark exact hands with the pegs).<br/><br/>Once someone claims four cells in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), they win. If a player cannot peg into a new cell because they can't beat a hand on the board, that player is eliminated.<br/><br/>Games Magazine's Best New Family Game for 1994<br/><br/>",

Each turn, the bank clock advances by either 10 or 20 minutes, and occasionally the SLOG (Somebody's Little Old Grandmother) will pop up, allowing the first player who escorts her between the Super Duper Market and the Library to claim any of the Fun City Cards available.  Each of the Fun City Cards is only available during a set timeframe, and the smaller the timeframe the more valuable it is.  When the clock reaches 5:00, players tally the Fun City Cards they've collected to determine the winner.<br/><br/>",

The exchanged goods must either be brought back for domestic storage (on the storage card) or to trade offices in other harbors, in exchange for other needed products.<br/><br/>On the storage cards each Hansa merchant finds the products that he must in the course of the game, put in storage. Once a merchant fills his storage card, the game ends and the winner is determined.<br/><br/>During this time period, wares were transported in sailing ships, cogs or later holks. To reduce the risk of such a dangerous and uncertain journey, merchants formed so-called companies with one or several partners and thereby distributed valuable loads on several ships.<br/><br/>In this game each player shares a Hansa cog with his left and right-hand neighbors. And there are risks to the voyage on all sides. Whether it be the feared pirates, the Vitalian Brotherhood, as they were known, wreaking havoc, whether storms rage over the North and Baltic Seas, or a harbor is blocked, a thousand things can cause difficulties in the life of an honorable merchant...<br/><br/>",

Each time a roll is made one or more scoring dice must be removed and the player can chose to stop with the total score they have accumulated or roll on. If no score is made on a roll, the player zilches and all the accumulated score for that turn (not from previous turns)is lost (like Can't Stop). If all the dice are used for scoring then the turn continues with all 6 dice again.<br/><br/>Scores are <br/>5=50<br/>1=100<br/>3 of a kind = kind X 100<br/><br/>On a 6 dice roll: 1,2,3,4,5,6 = 1500   <br/>and 3 pairs = 1000 (though six 6s can be 1200 from two triples of 600)<br/><br/>To win a player knocks instead of rolling on their turn and each other player has one turn to pass the leaders score.<br/><br/>Also there is an optional rule for the start: A score of less than 500 can not be kept until you are on the board and if a player Zilches on their first three turns they go negative whatever score they had before the final roll of their third turn and can subsequently stop at any score.<br/><br/>The game is suspenseful as players roll diminishing numbers of dice against increasing odds. It can have longish down time unless you decide to have several players having their turns at the same time with different sets of dice. (faster but less suspenseful).<br/><br/>",

A &quot;goal&quot; expression is formed, and then players take turns moving one cube at a time to one of three areas: Forbidden, Permitted, or Required. Each move is supposed to keep possible the ability to eventually form an expression equal to the goal, but it must not be possible to form such an expression immediately if there are still cubes remaining in the resources pile. Players may challenge each other if they believe a move has rendered impossible any expression that equals the goal, or if an expression can be formed prematurely. When a challenge is issued, all other players decide which side they want to be on. The side claiming that an expression is possible, has the burden of proof to create such an expression. The final expression must use all the Required cubes, none of the Forbidden cubes, and as many Permitted cubes as desired. Expressions are written down; the cubes are not moved. Parentheses may be inserted as desired. Rounds continue until some agreed condition is met (high score reached, or number of rounds).<br/><br/>",

Then, one at a time starting with the youngest player and continuing around the circle, draw a card and do what the card says. Hilarity ensues.<br/><br/>After you have dried your tears of hysteria and given your cheeks a rest, move the appropriate amount of spaces as indicated by the card.<br/><br/>BUT! Stay alert. The cards are the key to everything. Some of them award you points based on an action. Some are contests, where the winner moves. SOME even allow you to grant points to another player. They are EXTREMELY silly and will keep everyone on their toes.<br/><br/>Work your way down Silly Street.

A tan card with four complicated patterns on it is revealed, and after deciding which of the four designs you're matching, you have to find the corresponding blue card before your opponent(s) do.

Players must do all of this while not only surviving the dangers of the island, but also avoiding the Thief.<br/><br/>The Thief will hunt your players throughout the entire game; always trying to steal resources and deal damage to any player they cross paths with.

        "description": "Czas Zaorać Socjalizm (&quot;It's time to pulverize the socialism&quot;) is a mix of the card and the board game that brings players right into the fierce fight between right and left side. It's a game for 2-4 players, each with his own, prepared deck. Game is filled with well known persons of the right and left side of the politics. Players are using their cards to place them on the board and spread their controll and influence.<br/><br/>The game contains 210 cards, some of them picturing well known characters of the Polish politics, like Janusz Korwin-Mikke, Przemysław Wipler, Grzegorz Braun, Marian Kowalski (all of them used under permission) and so on, along with some historical ones, like Lenin or Stalin. Cards are divided into three fractions - left, right and neutral. Each player plays with his own, prepared deck. The idea is to place cards (characters and buildings) on the board, use the event cards to boost the statistics and finally, use them to make other players lose their Life Points (each player has 10 at start).<br/><br/>",

It introduces new amazing tropical animals and extinct animals(dodo, for example).<br/>The game can be combined with Cardline: Animals and Cardline: Dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Both sides of each card depict an animal, its name, and its class (amphibian, mammal, etc.), while its average length, weight, and lifespan are printed on only one side of the card. For each game, players decide before playing whether they're comparing animal lengths, weights, or lifespans.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player places a number of animal cards on the table in front of her with the characteristics hidden. One card is placed in the center of the table with its characteristics revealed. Players then take turns placing a card from their tableau in a row on the table; a player can place a card between any two other cards. After placing the card, the player reveals the characteristics on it. If the card was placed correctly &ndash; that is, with the particular characteristic in numerical order compared to all other cards on the table &ndash; the card stays in place; otherwise the card is removed from play and the player takes another card from the deck and adds it to her tableau.<br/><br/>The first player to get rid of all her cards by placing them correctly wins. If multiple players go out in the same round, then everyone else is eliminated from play and each of those players are dealt one more card for another round of play. If only one player has no cards after a bonus round, she wins; otherwise play continues until a single player goes out.<br/><br/>",

In Pictionary, though, both teams' (or even all three teams') clue givers may be drawing at the same time as players strive to be the first to guess the correct answer. When the answer is not designated &quot;All Play,&quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers. No great drawing talent is required; instead, players gain an edge if they have a good imagination when guessing, empathy for their team mates, and/or a general ability to communicate in restricted circumstances. A board is provided, just to keep score on, which focuses the competition. Pictionary was a big hit when it first appeared and has been a classic on the party game scene ever since.<br/><br/>This version of Pictionary, the beloved game of quick sketches and hilarious guesses, features a different board for faster gameplay. There are also two levels of clues (1,200 adult and 800 junior) so that everyone can play. Designed for 3 or more players. Recommended for ages 8 and over.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ll be drooling for more!<br/><br/>Players are dogs working together during a series of tests (rounds) given to them by famous Dogtors such as Sigmund Fetch, Collie Jung, and Bark F. Skinner! Each round one player is the Dogtor and ensures that the dogs are following the rules.<br/><br/>All players start with 3 bones. If they ever make a mistake they lose a bone and if one player is out of bones the game ends immediately. However,<br/><br/>The dogs (players) are tested each round by being dealt 5 cards from the test desk which they do not look at. The test deck consists of numbered cards in 3 suits (BLUE,YELLOW and BROWN) each featuring 6 different dog commands (SIT,SHAKE,SPEAK, FETCH,ROLLOVER and BEG). There are also 6 BELL cards in the test deck which are WHITE and valued at zero.<br/><br/>On a player&rsquo;s turn they will flip one of their dealt test cards and say the total value of the test. The first player may flip a YELLOW SHAKE ONE and they would state &ldquo;ONE&rdquo;.  The second player may flip a BROWN BEG TWO and they would state &ldquo;THREE&rdquo;, and so on.<br/><br/>The parameters/rules may change the value of a card or add an action requirement when a card type is played. Example rules are: SIT commands = ZERO or Bark when any BLUE card is played. Each round another parameter/rule is added making it more challenging to complete the full series of test. It is the Dogtor's job each round to ensure the dogs are following the rules.<br/><br/>If a dog announces the total value of the test correctly, the Dogtor will say GOOD DOG. This signifies that the dog was correct and the next dog (player) may go. In the event that a dog is incorrect, the Dogtor will say BAD DOG.<br/><br/>Whenever you are a bad dog, you lose one bone. The Dogtor then resets the total test value to zero and play continues until all dogs are out of test cards.  The game end immediately once one dog is out of bones and all players fail. However, players may share bones in between rounds as long as each player has at least one bone but no more than 3 bones. If all players still have bones at the end of your final round, you pass! Your collective score is based on the total number of bones at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Pavlov's Dogs has 3 levels of difficulty: Puppy (3 rounds), Dog (5 rounds) or Wolf (8 rounds). All players decide their level at the beginning of the game to determine the number of rounds they will play.<br/><br/>There is also a fun TEAM VARIANT in which players split into 2 teams and play 4 rounds to determine who did better.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Conquest Tactics is a strategy card game with a fantasy theme. Players lead their armies across a battlefield to clash with their opponent, employing hand management, resource allocation and battlefield strategy to outwit each other. Players deploy troop cards to a grid battlefield and pay tactical points to move, attack and cast spells. Skills and Spells are taught to a player's entire army and reused each turn. Each player chooses from a selection of victory conditions and must achieve three victory conditions to win the match.<br/><br/>The first chapter of Conquest Tactics features three army factions, but troops from different factions may be combined into one deck. The initial factions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Humans: A balanced faction with a wide variety of Spells and Skills<br/>    Kaborha: A powerhouse faction with strong, expensive troops and an emphasis on melee skills<br/>    The Malice: A swarming faction with overwhelming numbers and a penchant for dark magic<br/><br/><br/>For five hundred years, human civilization languished under the rule of the Kaborha, a society focused solely on honor, battle, and a tri-annual tournament for supremacy.  Now a young hero has emerged, bringing hope of returning humanity to its former glory. But even as Humans rise up against their oppressors, a new threat has come to their world.  The Malice -an interdimensional army of evil creatures- has descended upon the homeland of the Kaborha and Humans, lurching the Fire Continent out of a centuries long stagnation and into war! Traditional ways will be broken and unlikely alliances formed to repel the oncoming evil. Only you have the power to determine the future of the Fire Continent and the world of Yen-Sen.<br/><br/>The time has come for you to lead your chosen forces into battle in Conquest Tactics, a new strategy card game.  Choose your Victory Conditions and your Base, assemble your Troops and march them across the battlefield.  Teach them Spells and Skills to use again and again, and empower them with Equipment.  Bend fate in your favor with Circumstance cards, and claim powerful relics as your Trophies.  Vanquish your enemies by using real strategy, movement and range to your advantage. Never before has a collectible card game given you this much control and this level of strategic choice.<br/><br/>Rather than pursue a single goal, Conquest Tactics has several different Victory Conditions that can be achieved in order to win. You might choose to invade and occupy your opponent&rsquo;s side of the field, destroy their base, challenge troops that are stronger than your own, or upgrade a troop to it&rsquo;s highest potential.  As a reward for achieving a Victory Condition, you are bestowed a Trophy which grants a special onetime benefit, such as the ability to draw extra cards, deal additional damage or search for the perfect troop you need at the moment.<br/><br/>Each army in Conquest Tactics has its own types of troops. Unique to the world of Conquest Tactics are the Kaborha, a strong and proud race matching the cunning of humans with raw animalistic power. Troop cards have deployment, movement, and attack costs. The troop card also lists the damage done by the troop in an attack and the ability of the troop to defend itself. Finally, each troop card details the health of the troop and any special abilities that unit may have.  Some troops have the ability to cast magic or use special skills.<br/><br/>When your Troops can't get by on courage alone, give them Equipment to better their chances of survival.  Equipment comes in three varieties: Armor, Weapons and Accessories.  These improvements attach directly to a Troop, making it more powerful in the midst of battle.  Troops may also use spells and skills on the battlefield.  Spell cards consist of fire, light and dark magic that may be used to heal, harm, cripple and defend in battle. However, only troops that are able to cast a particular type of magic are able to use that magic's spells. These abilities are put into your Knowledge Pool where they may be used repeatedly throughout the game by your various troops, but they have a cost each time they are used and may only be used once per turn.<br/><br/>Each deck has one base which serves as a stronghold and is one of the principal sources of a player's power.  Bases give their armies additional strengths such as the ability to upgrade troops faster or replace fallen troops. However, Bases are not without their weakness as they may be destroyed, removing the benefits granted by it.<br/><br/>Circumstance cards may be played at any time and do not need to be cast by a troop with the ability to use magic.  These cards may enable you to increase your tactical points, negate an attack or even reflect an attack back at a troop when your opponent least expects it!  Circumstance cards are paid for using the cards in your hand. If you don't have enough cards to discard from your hand you can't use your circumstance cards, thus hand management is another essential skill in Conquest Tactics.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(description from publisher's website)<br/><br/>THE GAME CONCEPT<br/>It is 21st century America--a place where money talks and politicians listen. In this game, players are wealthy CEOs who bribe politicians to gain political power and influence. Players must be careful, however, because political scandal might bring down one's political friends and all of one's invested money. Players who use their money wisely to bribe the right politicians will be victorious.<br/><br/>OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY<br/>The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by having the highest total bribe on any of the five Politicians. On your turn, you will receive and play Money Cards and/or Power Cards. You bribe a Politician by placing a Money Card next to, and on your side of, a Politician Card (which are in the center of the table). The bribes grow as more Money Cards are played on the same Politicians. Power Cards are used to perform a variety of actions and are discarded after use (such as stealing other people's bribes). At game's end, all the bribes are revealed and tallied up. Players score Victory Points for each Politician that they have 'won' by having the biggest bribe. The player with the most Victory Points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Darwin&rsquo;s Dice is a simple, fast-paced trump card game, where two dice set the conditions of every turn. You&rsquo;ll need both a tactical approach as well as a fair amount of luck. Two to four players meet in this game for a struggle of sheer survival. Only the player who&rsquo;s best prepared and whose cards match the conditions can obtain the opponents&rsquo; cards and collect points.<br/><br/>Before each turn a player &ndash; the Darwin &ndash; rolls the dice. The combination of number (1 to 8) and colour (blue, green and yellow) determine which card becomes the trump during this turn. Additionally, one die (with + and -) specifies if high or low numbers have an advantage.<br/>Each player then plays a card upside down and then flip them over simultaneously. The player of the strongest card wins, becomes the new Darwin and rolls the dice for the next turn.<br/><br/>The strongest card is either the trump or &ndash; of no trump has been played &ndash; the highest or the lowest card. If it comes to a draw, the size of the animal is of the essence (+ for big / - for small). But there are three special cards as well:<br/>The red cards (1 to 8), if they should win a turn, although they are not able of becoming the trump and will always lose in a draw, they can destroy the collected cards of the player with the second best card.<br/>The grey cards (0 and 9) are always the highest or lowest numbers. They can only be beaten by the trump.<br/>The brown cards (4.5) are the worst cards, because they are neither the highest nor the lowest cards - they are right in the middle. But if the trump has been played, they are the only ones able to beat it.<br/><br/>A game consists of several rounds, each consisting of individual turns. Each turn consists of rolling the dice and playing one card. A round is over when all the hand cards have been played. The game is over when the card deck is used up.<br/><br/>At the end of each round &ndash; after all the hand cards have been played &ndash; the points of the cards, according to the number of symbols in the corner, are counted and written down. These points are safe and cannot be destroyed. <br/>At the end of the game &ndash; when the card deck is used up &ndash; the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

The card is oriented so that the two numbers each point to one of the sides of the board with the holes. Based on this tile, the coordinate stones are populated onto each side. First place the number corresponding to the tile, then fill in the rest of the side using numbers one through five consecutively. Players put their treasure chests, map tiles and guards behind their sight screen.<br/><br/>Each player has one of the following possibilities during his turn:<br/>- Take an open map tile and place it behind their screen;<br/>- Take a free guard and place it behind their screen;<br/>- Place a map tile or tiles on the board;<br/>- Place Treasure Chests on the board;<br/>- Place Guards on the board.<br/><br/>If a player scores he or she moves the corresponding landing craft on the scoring track.

        "description": "Manufactured in the USA!<br/><br/>Daimyo Senso is a 1-8 player game where each player takes the role of a 16th century Japanese daimyo in conquest to become the next Shogun. Players take turns during 4 seasons per year for 4 years, using predetermined commands during each season. Those commands are Move, Deploy, or Attack. Once per year, each daimyo may use one special skill, which amplifies the power of one of their commands. At the end of each year, players tally up their total Castles, Cities, and Fortresses and are awarded Honor based on that total.<br/><br/>The game is over after 4 years, and the player with the most Honor wins.<br/><br/>In single player, the board is set up with significantly more troops, and the player must battle through all of them to completely conquer 5 Regions within 4 years. This race against the clock also acts to help players understand the Actions and General Cards.<br/><br/>Edit: There are now additional multiplayer rules for playing the game out until only one player is left. This is an optional way to play, and makes the game much longer, but is still as strategic and even more desperately gratifying when a long-term plan comes together through alliance, deceit, and careful planning. Another optional rule sets the board up with all daimyo present even in a less-than-8 player game.<br/><br/>Each faction in the game is asymmetrical, and each has its own 4 special skills, called General Cards. The factions include:<br/>Oda - Beginning in south central Honshu, the Oda clan has powerful General Cards that allow him to wage war heavily and assign his armies to the most crucial battlefronts.<br/>Uesugi - The Uesugi clan's attacks are bolstered by powerful generals, and his tactical movements and deployments insure that his armies are where they need to be.<br/>Takeda - While the mighty Takeda war machine has deceptively light attack powers, their troop movements and deployments make them extremely able to defend their hard-won gains.<br/>Hojo - The Hojo employ shinobi, which allows them to completely fool their enemies. While an enemy may think the Hojo are weak on one front, their armies can immediately arrive on the opposite end of their kingdom, shocking enemies into submission.<br/>Miyoshi - The Miyoshi use deception and surprise tactics to hit their enemies where they're weakest. Their powerful navy insures their ability to suddenly appear on any coast at any time.<br/>Mori - The Mori clan uses cunning to thwart their opponents. Their swift advance through unoccupied territories and their ability to fight on multiple fronts at once make them a headache for any enemy to stop.<br/>Date - The Date clan can assault enemy castles with heroic actions, and their ferocity makes neighboring armies wither. Beware the city of Sendai, as the Date will fiercely defend it.<br/>Shimazu - From the southern tip of Kyushu, the Shimazu wage war with their enemies to the North and East.

Her commandments appear encoded on a series of eggs and it's your job as a devout disciple to not only work out the true meaning of the message, but to convince all the other disciples that your reading is the correct and only Truth.<br/><br/>The Laying:<br/>The Holy Chicken lays 6 eggs, on each is written a word that together forms a sentence<br/><br/>The Reading:<br/>All disciples have 1 minute to select the virtue card they think best covers the commandment<br/><br/>The Preaching:<br/>Disciples reveal their chosen virtue card and each disciple with a unique virtue gets a further minute to explain their reading of the commandment in detail, with regard to their virtue.<br/><br/>The Judgement:<br/>All the other disciples become judges for the round, and vote on which disciple gave the most compelling explanation of the commandment.<br/><br/>The Reward:<br/>The disciple who gets the most votes is rewarded with 2 pieces of corn. Or, if the vote is split, those disciples get 1 piece of corn each.<br/><br/>Canonisation:<br/>Play ten rounds, each time revealing a new commandment. The disciple who has collected the most corn is made into a Saint and rewarded with the record of all 10 commandments so they can go forth and start their own sect of Heninism.<br/><br/>It's a simple, creative, funny group game that scales well and plays out in about 45 minutes.<br/><br/>The cool thing is that while each disciple is competing to have their individual opinion heard and recorded, together, you collaboratively create what is essentially a new religion in the course of a game.<br/><br/>",

Players roll and move around the board collecting food items from the draw pile or other players. When a player lands on a &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go to McDonald&rsquo;s&rdquo; space, s/he draws a menu card and reads the order aloud. The other players have to fill the order as quickly as possible with the food items from their trays and toss colored marbles into the McDonald&rsquo;s sign chute when they believe they are complete and correct. The winning player (the one with the first marble in) then verifies that the order is filled correctly and if it is then s/he collects points for it, and if not then the next player finished verifies his or her order for the points, and so on. The player reading the order collects the food ordered &ndash; if the order cannot be filled correctly with any player&rsquo;s available items, the order in cancelled and roll and move play continues. Players score 1 point per food item served, or excess (any more than three) food item from their own tray returned to the draw pile before they roll to move for their turn - but they do not score any if they forget and roll first, but they still have to return excess items.

Whether the starlet in the bar around the corner, the greedy miser in the bank, or the Casanova three streets down, everyone had only one goal: to amass mountains of money, then squander it again in the most spectacular way.<br/><br/>In Scheffeln &mdash; a German word meaning to make a lot of money &mdash; players choose characters to conduct business for them. Using your hand of cards, you move these characters to the different businesses to earn bucks in the gambling business, smuggle alcohol, or act as a film industry mogul. You can move not only your own character, but also those of your opponents to mess up their strategy.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player has two options. Either play one of the four movement cards and move one of the eight characters, or play a card face down and take another character card from the middle of the table. Through the skillful placement of their characters, the players get money based on the street and business of their representative. And money is everything in Scheffeln! The winner is determined after one of the business spaces is empty of money.<br/><br/>Also included is the variant Speed Scheffeln. Up to 7 players may compete. 7 movement cards are revealed and players must determine, as fast as possible, which character will earn the most money after the movement cards are evaluated. Think quickly, and you'll be able to choose the best character. Too slow, and you'll be stuck picking from the leftovers!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A social deduction game in which one player is a psychotherapist trying to discover what shared dreams their patients suffering from mass hysteria have been having. The game uses large cards with surreal dreamlike images set out in a grid. The Patients all know which card they&rsquo;re discussing but the psychotherapist does not. The problem is that one of the patients is genuinely insane and has been give the wrong card to talk about. This patient needs to remain anonymous to win the game.<br/><br/>The beauty of this game is that nobody knows who that one insane patient is, not even themselves. This means that everyone has to be really cagey about their communication until they work out (if they work out) who it is. But with all this vague and obtuse communication going on how can you be sure that it&rsquo;s not you who is insane?<br/><br/>A game of real suspense and paranoia it will have you questioning who you can trust, and even if you can trust yourself.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It intentionally does not try to be all encompassing but consciously focuses on specific strands of the story as simply and straight forwardly as possible.  Good advice for storytellers and game designers.  While a bit primitive by today's standards Lost Battles is nevertheless complete and playable presenting many interesting problems to be solved.  Though only four scenarios are provided with game, the highly variable victory conditions actually make the game extremely replayable.  The game also provides brief tools to design many scenarios of your own.  In fact you could say that it is this that the game does most best.  It is likely that many early designers played a game or two of this before going their own way taking with them the bits and pieces of the simulacrum that suited them.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sun, sea, free drinks and slot machines! Welcome on board of the luxurious Baby Cruise! While your spouse is visiting the sun deck, you promise to take care of the kids...in the on-board casino with a cocktail in your hand. Generously you are giving free drinks to the other &quot;responsible&quot; parents &mdash; yes, the cruise is all inclusive! &mdash; but with every cocktail you offer, you increase their chances of triggering the jackpot.<br/><br/>The kids are bored quite fast and start messing up your plans. Baby Luck gives poker chips to another parent, the Shy Baby offers a cocktail to the most thirsty passenger, the Captain Baby passes one of your cocktails on to another parent, and the Police Baby can rat you out to your spouse if you had too many cocktails. All that chaos grants plenty of bluffing opportunities to snatch the jackpot for yourself. Make sure you'll win the jackpot before you get caught drunk behind a slot machine or you'll be in big trouble!<br/><br/>Every turn in Baby Cruise, you take a card from the draw pile and show it to everybody. You must give the card to another player. Most cards show a baby, a cocktail, and a fruit symbol. Every baby has their own special rules, and they can mess up your plans (or the plans of the other players). As soon as you have received a set of three matching fruit symbols, you win the round, but you can also lose a round if you get caught drunk with too many cocktails in your hands!<br/><br/>Some cards show a slot machine and a cocktail. These cards also have to be given to another player and it will give them an additional winning condition, but due to the cocktail they also increase the risk of getting caught drunk.<br/><br/>If you play several rounds the winner of a round will receive golden milk bottles and the loser (if there is one) will lose a token. The parent who owns the most golden milk bottles when they run out wins the jackpot (and the game).<br/><br/>",

Reveal  two &quot;bonus vault&quot; cards that show special ways to score.<br/><br/>Each player then simultaneously and secretly writes a &quot;heist&quot; word on their player board using only the letters revealed, with as  many copies of those letters as they like. Once everyone has  finished, each player drops clues to their word by placing their personal clue tokens on as many public letters as they wish; if you use a letter multiple times in your word, you must mark the letter that many times.<br/><br/>Next, after looking at those clues, each player writes a &quot;halt&quot; word on their player board that they think corresponds to an opponent's word.<br/><br/>All players then reveal their words one by one. If two or more players have the same word, none of them score for that word; if an opponent has &quot;halted&quot; your word, then they score for that word instead of you! A word scores 1 point for each clue token you placed, +1 or +2 points for you using the letters placed in those slots, and bonus points if you met one or both &quot;bonus vault&quot; challenges.<br/><br/>After writing all the used &quot;heist&quot; and &quot;halt&quot; words on a public board, shuffle the letter cards, then play another round.

Traps are possible.<br/>- The Treasure deck is used to give out booty to adventurers that defeat monsters.  Traps are possible here, as well.<br/><br/>The game is very simplistic and could easily be developed into something much more advanced, but it is rather fun and can easily be played solitaire.<br/><br/>",

Players compete in international trade for vital resources: minerals, oil and grain. Speculate and trade commodities on the world market. A strong economy fuels the arms race as you build armies, navies, nukes and a &quot;star-wars&quot; defense system. Borrow money from the world bank or invest in bonds to increase your income. Don't borrow too much or the crushing interest will bankrupt you!<br/><br/>As conflicts and nuclear arsenals grow, the world becomes a much more dangerous place. A nuclear strike may vanquish an enemy, but will the retaliation trigger a nuclear winter destroying the world? To win, you'll need a delicate balance of diplomacy, economic and military strength. You must form alliances, negotiate, threaten and bluff. Many strategies can lead to victory &ndash; but only one superpower will achieve supremacy.<br/><br/>This redesign of the classic cold war game Supremacy has an updated map and currency for the 21st century, along with corrected and streamlined rules to make the game faster, simpler and more intense.<br/><br/>",

The system allows for a full grid of cars &mdash; not just the players', but also privateers that ran alongside, and usually hindered, the factory teams.<br/><br/>Each player controls two racing teams: one in the top category and another slower team unlikely to win, but capable of reaching the podium and ending in the money. That is important since the game's winner is based on money earned. Winning, though, is adjusted based on the level of cars a player selects, so taking the &quot;best&quot; cars may not be the optimal strategy for victory when the car ability bonus is applied.<br/><br/>Gameplay is handled with a randomized team draw that determines player order in addition to generating random events; these events emphasize the dangerous and unreliable nature of 1920s and 1930s driving, courses, and early race technology. On a player's turn, cars move a certain number of spaces with the option of slipstreaming, &quot;charging&quot; (which permits multiple bonus spaces if clear track is ahead), and blocking (which can force trailing cars to spin out).<br/><br/>The game takes 45-60 minutes to play a race, and games can be combined into a multi-race contest or even a full season if the players wish.<br/><br/>Supercharged reworks the 1992 game Grand Prix Manager by the same designers.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It became very popular with players around the world.<br/><br/>In 2011, Steve&rsquo;s son Josh decided to re-release Megiddo with an updated design and new innovative rule change. Kl&uuml;ndt | Hosmer re-designed the look of the game for a new generation of players. A redesigned board, instruction booklet and packaging brought new energy to this timeless game, named after an ancient Hebrew city where numerous historical battles were waged.<br/><br/>Megiddo will be available for purchase on Amazon.com and will soon be available as an app for iPhone and Android smart phones.<br/><br/>We love design.

During each season, players play cards from their hand in order to track animals, or to use their skills.<br/><br/>Players start the game with just a few trails, a card that will allow them to track animals from the supply, adding them to their individual deck to adjust it to suit a particular strategy.<br/><br/>Animals provide them with unique ways to deal with the various threats in the game as well as helping them to efficiently manage their resources.<br/><br/>Animals do more than just produce game effects to rely on during the game however, and are a main source of points.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, victory points will be awarded depending on the players&rsquo; deck content as well as majority in the savannah.<br/><br/>The competition track may also tilt the outcome in favour of the player who best achieved to stay one or more step ahead of their opponent!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "They Live: Assault on Cable 54 is a narrative driven, adventure game that features hidden enemies inspired by the 1988 sci-fi classic.<br/><br/>The main game features a cooperative campaign designed for 4-6 players taking the roles of Human or Invader (secondly a 1-2 Player Blind Play mode is currently in development). <br/>Most importantly, it includes a real-world working pair of Hoffman Lenses that not only make you feel more immersed in the world of the movie, but are also an integral part of the game.<br/><br/>The adventure involves players exploring the city of LA to gain assets that will prepare them for the final push against the oppression of the Invaders.<br/> Players will assume the role of either a Human or an Invader, and that will determine if they plan to strengthen the resistance or sabotage their efforts to succeed. However, this role will be hidden from the other players, and can only be detected by using the Hoffman Lenses.<br/><br/>Great effort has been taken to ensure that this feels like a living, breathing story within the world of the classic movie.<br/><br/><br/>     Can a simple drifter rise to lead the resistance against our Invaders?<br/>     Can a corrupt politician find redemption?<br/>     Can a tired detective track down an elusive Invader-targeting serial killer? <br/><br/><br/>These stories are told through a unique story deck for each character. The order of their deck is randomised, and how many cards it takes to complete your story depends on your success with each. This system means a different personal-story experience each time you play. <br/>Each story features different endings depending on if you&rsquo;re playing as a Human or an Invader. Completing them is optional, but doing so will reward you with unique character items and special skills to aid in overthrowing the Invaders, or sabotaging the resistance.<br/><br/>The game contains a ticking timer that progresses towards a fixed deadline. In order to win the game, you need to get to Cable 54 and start the &lsquo;final assault&rsquo; before the clock hits midnight!<br/><br/>The &lsquo;final assault&rsquo; contains three story-based trials that your team will need to overcome to win. Doing so will require high-level characters that players have developed throughout the game. You will also need a vast stash of weapons, items and allies to be victorious.<br/> Each of the three trials will test your skills, and require you to spend assets on improving your chances of successful dice rolls. It&rsquo;s during this assault that enemy players are most likely to reveal themselves, and spend their sabotaged goods on halting your progress.<br/><br/>With the correct planning, the right equipment, and a little luck, you have the chance to stop the signal once and for all, and live on in legend as part of resistance history. <br/>If you fail, well, things will be a lot worse&hellip;<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The players take turns to roll a color die, then announce how many goat heads are under the cup in the corresponding color. When an announcement is correct, the player gets one head and hides the rest under the cup again.<br/>When an announcement is wrong, the player gets the wolf and keeps it until another player guesses wrongly. But when the player who already has the wolf announces a wrong number, he or she has to dump one goat to the wolf.<br/><br/>The game ends when either one player has collected seven heads (and thus wins) or the wolf has six (and thus all players lose).<br/><br/>French description:<br/>Contenu: 6 cachettes de couleur, 30 chevreaux, 1 loup, 1 d&eacute; multicolore (6 couleurs), 1 d&eacute; multicolore (3 couleurs, pour la variante simplifi&eacute;e), 1 r&egrave;gle du jeu.<br/><br/>Dur&eacute;e de la partie : env.15 minutes<br/><br/>But du jeu : sauver les chevreaux cach&eacute;s avant qu'ils ne tombent dans la gueule du loup.<br/>Un formidable jeu de m&eacute;moire comprennant une variante pour les joueurs plus jeunes.

Although everyone will produce exactly the same quantity of fruit during the course of the game, the production will be in a random order, so choosing when to harvest or when to try and raid is dependent not only on your own potential but that of your rivals too.<br/><br/>",

Two rules, basic and speed, are provided in the manual. The following describes the basic rule.<br/><br/>Each player initially gets 15(13 for 4 players) consonant tiles and 5 vowel tiles and then tries by turn to form a Korean word using his/her tiles. After the mandatory first time registration of 3 or more syllable word, each player's word can contain any number of syllables. Also each player can re-use any tiles from the previous player's word and return not used tiles to the draw pile; therefore there is at most only one formed word all the time. If a player cannot form a word, he/she can exchange any number of tiles with draw tiles and end his/her turn. The first player to use all his/her hand tiles<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Rules:<br/><br/>A wise man named Wei Fu had five sons who he loved dearly.  He loved each in his own way, but favored his oldest most of all.  In fact, he showed affection and appreciation to each son in descending order of their birth.  Over time, this greatly displeased his younger sons to the point of confrontation.  Being respectful to their father, the younger two sons did not accuse their father directly, but merely asked the question:  &quot;What more can I do to earn your respect?&quot;  At first the father was outraged that his younger sons would question his fidelity, but then he realized their defiance presented an opportunity.<br/><br/>His land had been plagued by prankster Dragon that ate his crops, scared away his workers and generally caused chaos throughout his land.  He decided to put his younger sons to the test of ridding his land of this Dragon.  The sons agreed, but pleaded:  &quot;Should our older brothers be denied this opportunity to prove their devotion to you?&quot;  Knowing full well his sons' intent, Wei Fu agreed to send all five sons on the quest.  However, his older sons, fearful for their safety, begged for a reprieve.  Acquiescing, Wei Fu decided to ease the burden by declaring:  &quot;The Dragon is the quest!  However, I would still appreciate any son who brings me the finest examples of the Five Elements of Water, Wood, Fire, Earth, and Metal, which provide the very foundation of our world.&quot;  With this alternative quest, he would assign the easier tasks to his older sons&mdash;or so he thought.<br/><br/>Weilong or &quot;Powerful Dragon&quot; is a simple dice game based loosely on the dice game One-O-Five and the Chinese card game Shou Ba Yi.  Each player represents the role of one of Wei Fu's sons on their quest to collect the Five Elements or capture the Dragon.  Each player rolls their dice and sets aside those dice showing their target number (Element).  The objective is to roll all five dice of the target number before any other player.  Target numbers are determined by drawing cards (Son Cards).   The Son Cards also have unique abilities for the players.<br/><br/>Once a player has set aside all five dice of the target number or captured the Dragon (by collecting the dice 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), the remaining players add up the total of the dice they have collected along with the penalty number at the bottom of the card and track those points.  Your goal is have the lowest point total each round and for the game.  The Son cards are then passed to the left and the next round begins (5 Player Game).  The winner is the player who has the least amount of points after 5 rounds.<br/><br/>",

The words are explained in completely new and crazy ways whenever the team lands on one of the Party spaces. You might get to tell a crazy story that includes all the words on a card, describe celebrities, or try to explain the words without using a certain letter. You also get to explain words in different moods &ndash; will you be hysterical, depressed or angry? Party Alias challenges everyone to explain, get active and use their creativity!<br/><br/>This travel version is different from the first Party Alias. It uses dice instead of a spinner, has fewer cards, and the story telling cards are made a little shorter (only 4 required to get the bonus).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the introduction:)<br/><br/>The Moscow Option: Guderian's Gambit is a simulation of the fighting that could have taken place between Smolensk and Moscow during the first half of August 1941 if Hitler had decided to concentrate his eastern armies' supply in order to allow the mechanized forces of Army Group Center to make the 150 miles to the Soviet capital city. Historically, of course, the German dictator chose instead to halt the AGC, temporarily de-emphasizing Moscow as a target while diverting his forces' strength on the front's northern and southern sectors. Here we assume he chose instead to reorganize the mobile divisions of Panzer Groups 2 and 3 and ad hoc Panzer Army Guderian, putting that general in charge of a daring effort to take Moscow, thereby winning the war by plunging the entire Soviet Union into strategic paralysis.<br/><br/>This is a two-player, operational-level, alternative history wargame of low complexity. In it, the German player controls all Panzer Army Guderian units and is opposed by the Soviet player who controls all the Red Army units.<br/><br/>The situation is inescapably such that the German player controls the strategic initiative and sets the overall tempo of play. We therefore recommend opponents who share a particularly competitive relationship should play a series of matches, switching sides each time, before deciding who between them owns bragging rights to the game.<br/><br/>1 hex : 9 miles<br/>GT : 1 day<br/>Units : divisions and brigades (3000-12000 men and/or about 50 to 180 armored vehicles)<br/><br/>",

Contending against them were the Kingdom of France, the Ottoman Empire and miscellaneous minor states, as well as the rising tide of Protestantism.<br/><br/>HRE is primarily intended to be played by four, each representing a different major power: the Hapsburgs, France, the Ottomans, and the &ldquo;League&rdquo; (the latter representing assorted minor power coalitions that came and went). Each player has a variety of military and political instruments with which he can attempt to gain control of Europe. The rules are written with procedures for four-player games in mind; however, games with three or two players can also be managed by using the altered framework provided for such contests.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from Decision games website:)<br/><br/>Pavia was the climactic clash of the Italian Wars, a decades-long struggle between Valois France and Habsburg Spain for control of Italy. Both sides have nascent pike-and-shot armies, the French still relying upon feudal knights, and the Spanish increasingly dependent on new individual firearms. Both sides also relied on mercenaries: Italian musketeers, Swiss pikemen, German Landsknechts. Tercios, too, are in their infancy; at Pavia, the battle is fought by smaller formations maneuvering in a broken, wooded area.<br/><br/>Pavia uses the new Pike &amp; Shot game system to portray the battlefields of the early gunpowder period. Infantry is based on pike formations with varying numbers of attached musketeers. Other musketeers operate independently, useful for skirmishing but vulnerable to both infantry and cavalry. Shock power comes from heavy cavalry, armored horsemen armed with pistol and sword, but relying increasingly on firepower to wear down opponents. Light cavalry roam the battlefield, too weak to stand up to their heavy cousins, but ruthless during a pursuit. The newest form of horsemen are the dragoons, men trained to fight mounted and on foot, ideal for seizing key points in advance of the main body. Artillery is still in its infancy; the large, powerful guns are all-but-immobile. However, different armies at different times experiment with lighter, more mobile weapons.<br/><br/>Game Contents:<br/>&bull;    17 x 22&rdquo; map<br/>&bull;    100 die-cut counters<br/>&bull;    One Standard Rules booklet for this series<br/>&bull;    One Exclusive Rules booklet for this title<br/><br/>",

It's a two-player strategy game that combines the best elements of both these classics on a uniquely designed game board.<br/><br/>Each player begins with eighteen pieces: two &quot;Octego pieces&quot;, and sixteen other pieces that may move one, two, or three spaces per turn, depending on how each is labeled. Players must either capture both Octego pieces from the opponent or move one of his or her own Octego pieces to the opposite side of the board.<br/><br/>The real challenge comes from playing on a board that is actually two separate grids of spaces. Pieces on one grid may not interact with pieces on the other, although pieces may at times change grids. This allows players to try two different strategies at the same time!<br/><br/>Octego can be learned in just a few minutes, but you'll have years of fun trying to master it!<br/><br/>",

It's a ball-stacking game that can be played with a Series: Shibumi set, as it uses a 4x4 holes board and balls in two colours (white and black). Larger boards can also be used, but no more than 6x6 is recommended.<br/><br/>Rules:<br/><br/>Definition: A pinned ball is a ball that supports 2 or more balls on the level above. Pinned balls cannot be moved/removed. Movable balls are balls that are not pinned.<br/><br/>2 players. The board starts empty. Starting with white, players take turns either:<br/><br/>a) placing a ball of their colour on an empty space or platform (2&times;2 arrangement of marbles) or...<br/><br/>b) moving a movable ball of their colour already on the board to another valid location. If supported balls drop as a consequence of the ball removal, you can't place your ball on top of the dropped balls.<br/><br/>Aim:<br/><br/>The first player making a full line of his color on any layer wins. Lines may be diagonal.<br/><br/>This is, for a 4&times;4 set, a 4-in-a-row on the first layer, or a 3-in-a-row on the 2nd layer, or a 2-in-a-row on the 3rd layer.<br/><br/>In case of several lines being created as a result of balls dropping, the largest line prevails.<br/><br/>ONLINE PLAY<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.jocly.com/jocly/hubquick/shibumi-splineplus\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.jocly.com/jocly/hubquick/shibumi-splineplus</a><br/><br/>(Human and AI)<br/><br/>Included in the Shibumi Rule Book<br/><br/>Soft cover:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-andres/shibumi-rule-book/paperback/product-18940123.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.lulu.com/shop/cameron-browne-and-nestor-romeral-a...</a><br/><br/>Downloadable PDF:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.nestorgames.com/rulebooks/SHIBUMI_EN.pdf</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game, similar to Whist, is mostly played in Minnesota and South Dakota and was brought there by settlers from Norway.  It is extremely similar to a Scandinavian game, often listed in English language card game books under the name Norwegian Whist.<br/><br/>There are four players in two fixed partnerships. Using a standard 52 card pack and no trumps.<br/><br/>High / Low Bids<br/>Each hand is played either &quot;high&quot; or &quot;low&quot;. If it is played &quot;high&quot;, the partnership that takes at least 7 of the 13 tricks scores points. If it is played &quot;low&quot;, a partnership must take 6 or fewer tricks to avoid losing points.<br/><br/>With High bid, when all 13 tricks have been played, the side which won more tricks scores 1 point for each trick they won in excess of 6. While with low bid, the side which won more tricks loses 1 point for each trick they have in excess of 6.<br/><br/>End of the Game<br/>The partnership which first reaches 13 points wins the game. This takes several deals.<br/><br/>Variations<br/><br/>South Dakota Whist<br/>    This version has different scoring than Minnesota Whist. If players win fewer than 7 tricks while bidding high, they lose 1 point for each trick below 7. The other team does not score. If everyone bid low, the team that takes 7 or more tricks loses one point for each trick in excess of 6. The game is played to 11 points rather than 13.<br/><br/>",

After he went to the oracle at Delphi and prayed to the god Apollo for guidance, Hercules was instructed to serve King Eurystheus and perform twelve difficult labours to atone for his actions. In this game, players will take on the roles of Hercules and his companions to complete these twelve labours (known as tasks). However, things are not as easy as they appear - mysterious perils await you, and some of you might betray Hercules!<br/><br/>The Labours of Hercules is a cooperative game for 4-7 players. Each round, different tasks will appear on the table. To complete a task, Hercules needs to collaborate with his companions to gather the necessary items.<br/><br/>As the game continues, new tasks will arise to challenge Hercules and his companions. If Hercules fails to complete the tasks, he will lose courage (represented by bravery tokens), which may lead some his companions to betray him and further increase his challenge. Hercules and his companions win if they complete all the tasks. But if Hercules loses all of his bravery tokens, Hercules and his companions lose and villains who betrayed him win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "If I'm Going Down... (or IIGD) is the first ever Dying Card Game (or DCG) from Van Ryder Games. A DCG is a card game in which it is certain that the character(s) WILL die. For 1 to 2 players (expandable to 3 to 4 with a 2nd copy), IIGD is set in a world overrun by zombies. Unlike virtually every other Zombie game, your goal is not to survive, but to kill as many zombies as possible before you die, which results in very engrossing solo or cooperative play.<br/><br/>IIGD puts you smack in the middle of a hopeless scenario where endless zombies lurch and ramble toward you, never stopping until you are dead or become one of them (Zead). You must gather and use weapons and resources to take as many of the abominations as you can with you.<br/><br/>Zombies enter the playing area from several &quot;Entry&quot; points depending on the scenario. You can take actions during your turn such as Attack, Use an Item, or Search for Resources. Each turn the Zombies will be moved closer and closer and eventually the resources will run out...<br/><br/>Random events or &quot;Occurrences&quot; that come into play and change the rules keep the game fresh and different every time. The game may be played in a sort of &quot;Kill em All&quot; mode where you simply try to achieve the best score or you can play one of several Story Arcs that add entertaining story lines to the game where how well you do determines what happens in the story after you die.<br/><br/>The unique mechanisms of the Fate Deck &ndash; which determines whether you find a resource when searching and whether you &quot;hit&quot; or &quot;miss&quot; during an attack &ndash; and the Tracker cards &ndash; which are used to keep track of health, ammo, and inventory &ndash; make this a game unlike any you have seen before.<br/><br/>One other thing that makes this game unique in the Zombie genre is that each Zombie is illustrated with AMAZING detail and has a character all its own. You may just become more invested in the story of the Zombies than you are in the characters you play!<br/><br/>IIGD allows for some level of creative control for players who have interest in making their own layouts and scenarios.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Decision Games' website:<br/><br/>Napoleon was, by 1813, the victim of his own success. His Grande Arm&eacute;e had ransacked most of Europe, but then the Prussians, Austrians, Russians, Swedes and others converged their armies, collectively known as the Sixth Coalition, around Leipzig in an attempt to annihilate Napoleon once and for all. The coalition commanders knew they had to approach cautiously. Napoleon had previously defeated each of those nations' armies, and had demonstrated a remarkable ability to overcome unfavorable odds before. At Leipzig, however, Napoleon was heavily outnumbered, and the princes of Europe realized there might never be a better chance to vanquish him and finally end the Napoleonic Wars.<br/><br/>Leipzig utilizes an all-new Musket &amp; Saber Combat System, which provides a simple yet accurate portrayal of Napoleonic warfare. The combat system is intuitive, including all the details that characterized battle during the era while also simulating the unique aspectsof 19th century warfare. Units can become weakened and rout; attackers can pursue, and the fortunes of war can intervene at any time. Cavalry can rip open enemy lines and shred fleeing units, and reserves must be ready to plug holes or secure a line of retreat.<br/><br/>In Leipzig a new Combat Results Table emphasizes playability while also simulating the lethality of musket and bayonet engagements of that time. Leaders accelerate the action, replicating the importance of their presence during battle, and supply lines require players to protect their logistical trains. Winning a battle will depend on deployment, maneuver and massing firepower, as well as the strengths and weaknesses of each particular army.<br/><br/>",

L&ouml;st das R&auml;tsel von Schr&auml;ghausen!, a sequel to the Spiel des Jahres-winning children's game Wer war's? by Reiner Knizia, an electronic device is once again added to the board game. Players are co-operating against an evil goblin who has caused chaos by making everyone forget everything: Farm animals no longer know who their master is, and people have forgotten where they live. The actions on the board are guided by talking radio, and the Fairy Godmother helps the players.<br/><br/>Nine children of different colors are randomly distributed in the nine houses and they should find their way to their real home - if they knew where they belong! The mystery must be solved in order to make everything work again. Bronco the dog, Rocky the parrot, Schorsch the turtle and Susi the cat must work together. If you get hold of the right key, then you can help the yellow kid regain his memories and get home, after which you'll hear from the radio an enthusiastic child's voice: &quot;Yes, this is my house, thank you for helping me! Now I remember again!&quot; The friendly female narrator's voice adds: &quot;Well done...&quot; &ndash; and sends a warning afterwards: &quot;Beware, the goblin is coming!&quot;<br/><br/>The goblin is nasty: It makes all the intersections turn. Where there was a way before is now blocked. Fortunately, there's also a good fairy who helps!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Destruction of Army Group Center: The Soviet Summer Offensive, 1944, is a simulation on a corps/division level of the Russian Summer Offensive of 1944 on the Eastern Front (Operation Bagration). Historically this offensive destroyed one entire Nazi Army Group, and prevented large transfers of men and equipment to the newly formed Western Front where the Anglo-American forces were expanding their beachhead in preparation for the August Breakout. The game covers the first twenty days of the offensive, during which all the decisive action took place. There are several scenarios, depicting a variety of likely possibilities, from the historical one through various degrees of German preparedness and 'sanity'.&quot;<br/><br/>Units represent Russian corps and Axis divisions. Stacking limit is 3 units/hex. Players alternate moves. Order of phases in each movement turn is: movement phase, combat phase, second mechanized movement phase. Semi-active zones of control extend into adjacent hexes, with some exceptions. Units pay two extra movement points to enter or leave an enemy zone of control, and may move directly from one controlled hex to another if they have enough movement points. Attacking is voluntary. Combat results involve unit eliminations, exchanges, and retreats, but the Axis mechanized units have a modified step-reduction mechanism (an eliminated Axis mechanized unit is replaced by a weak battlegroup which has no zone of control, and is worth extra victory points to the Russian player if it's eliminated in a later combat).<br/><br/>Victory is determined by victory points, gained by eliminating enemy units and, for the German player, for failure by the Russian player to have a continuous line from the north to the south board edge at the end of his turn.<br/><br/>Four scenarios are provided, ranging from the historical one where Hitler's propensity for issuing &quot;Stand Fast&quot; orders finally caught up with the Axis, to the maximum withdrawal scenario, in which the Axis essentially eliminates the portion of the front historically covered by Army Group North and uses the forces of that Army Group to strengthen the resulting greatly-shortened line in the Army Group Center area.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 days<br/>Hex: 10 miles / 16 km<br/>Units: Kampfgruppe to Corps<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 28&quot; map<br/>One single-side printed countersheet (200 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One foldout rules folder (folds out to 10 pages)<br/><br/>",

The Romans, meanwhile, built up their strength and eventually counterattacked, leading to a Roman victory.<br/><br/>The game shows the difference between the two military systems, the Carthaginians start out with better leaders, but the Romans have a greater population to build armies from. The game map represents countries of the Western Mediterranean area in which the war actually took place.<br/><br/>Each turn represents one year. During each turn, there is in sequence a Diplomacy Segment, a Carthaginian turn and a Roman turn. Basic and Advanced Rules allow customization of gameplay. Strategic movement is performed on the map. When armies engage each other, they are transferred to a Battleboard, which allows for army field positioning and tactical combat.  Amphibious Assaults, Recruiting and Promotion on the March, Siege Assault, Naval Combat and Interception, and Neutrals are all part of the basic rules.

Through the project, called &quot;The Perfect Game&quot;, we have tried to create a perfect game. So, everyone could vote for: the game system, duration of the game, number of players, concept, title and artwork. The gamers decided upon the elements and the basis. On this basis, people could send in games concepts, add from those, Tycho van den Broek emerged as the winner. 999Games has developed the concept and the wishes of the voters into a complete game!<br/><br/>In this exciting board game, players found a new city. This develops through the construction of new buildings, growing the number of Burghers (&quot;Poorters&quot;) that live there. As prosperity increases, the Burghers replace the surrounding forest wuth green pastures and waving fields of grain. In the city, stately mansions are erected and is worked at the City Hall, the Hospice and other community buildings.<br/><br/>On your turn, you always choose a character, such as the Lumberjack or the Sheriff. THen, all players can perform this character's action. You get a privilege added to this action. You can earn points by placing buildings and selling much needed food. The game includes different specialists such as the Baker, the Fishmonger and the Tavern. As a result, there are infinitely many strategic options. But the Middle Ages were certainly not free of hazards such as crime, wolves plague and the Black Death, which may appear through the playing of cards. If you are the first to score 30 points, you win the game.<br/><br/>",

Gluons and quarks are elementary particles that make up matter, and each time a player experiences a valid interaction between quarks they receive 1 point. The winner is the one with the most points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>This game celebrates the life and career of physicist Teresa Rodrigo Anoro (1956-2020), one of the most brilliant researchers in her field at an international level, and also the first Spaniard to join the European Particle Physics Laboratory (CERN).<br/><br/>Extended explanation of gameplay:<br/><br/>In Gluons, players will compete against each other to carry out valid interactions between the 3 quarks, using gluons. They do so by taking turns to play cards face down in the quark. Once all players don't want to play more cards, the resolution phase starts, and players then take turns to reveal one of their played card to check if the interaction is correct. If yes, they exchange the affected quarks, and keep the card as a point. At the end of the game, the player with the most valid interactions will be the winner.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The year is 1886 in a small forgettable hovel of a town on the border of nowhere. Several unscrupulous individuals come together for a hand of poker over a pile of cash. A whispered accusation of chicanery crosses the table and irons are yanked from holsters. The sparse crowd dives for cover and lead arcs towards flesh, the saloon aching for a fresh coat of crimson.<br/><br/>A Fistful of Dinero, the first game published by Magic House Games, is a card game for 3-6 players set in the wild west. After a poker game goes terribly wrong, players draw their weapons, make a quick grab for the cash, throw chairs, dive for cover, and do everything they can to be the richest gunslinger &mdash; or just the last man standing...<br/><br/>At the start of a round, players draft cards and place (program) them in one of three slots. Then in player order, players reveal the first slot and take one of the two available actions. Players can fire their weapons, hide beyond cover, switch weapons, grab money, etc. Players also have the opportunity to &quot;throw&quot; chairs or other items (cards) onto an opponent's player board to do additional damage.<br/><br/>The game ends in two ways: If a player takes five points of damage, he's dead and out of the game, with the last man (or woman!) standing winning it all. Alternatively, if the pot of dinero ever runs out, the richest outlaw wins.<br/><br/>Highlights Include:<br/>-Card Drafting with Conflict<br/>-Action Programming<br/>-Completely unique cover system based on seating location<br/>-Literally throw chairs, tables, knives, tomahawks, and dynamite at your opponents by physically tossing cards<br/>-Descriptive wounds with story flair and lasting repercussions<br/>-Intense narrative that unfolds organically from actions performed (heavily inspired by the classic Avalon Hill game Gunslinger)<br/><br/>",

In the game of Kamozza, you are exporters and your goal is to load as much of your freight as possible into ships.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each player has the same set of freight cards of various loads.<br/><br/>There are two docks on the table. Each round, two ships come into these docks. The one of these two ships has larger load capacity, and the other has smaller. Then each player secretly chooses a freight card from their hand and destination ship to load the freight. When they are revealed, count up the load for each ship. If the load exceeds the ship's capacity, the ship is sunk. Otherwise freight is successfully loaded and victory points are scored to the successful players.<br/><br/>After the fifth round, the highest scorer wins the game.<br/><br/>This game is simple but exciting, and its artwork is cute. You can play another game using the same cards. You should load your freight from heavier to lighter, but if you and other player play the same card, both cards cancel each other and you miss a chance to load. This game is also exciting.<br/><br/>The game was originally produced in 2012 in Japanese. A new edition has been made for Spiel 2016 with rules available in English, German and French (game-play being language independent).<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>輸出業者となって積み荷を船に載せるカードゲームです。２つの港があり大きな船と小さな船が其々の港に着きます。船の大きさに限度があるのでプレイヤーは他のプレイヤーの裏をかき人の少ない港を目指すことが重要です。船の大きさを超えて積み荷が乗ると船は沈んでしまうでしょう。シンプルで盛り上がるゲームです。絵柄もカワイイと評判です。また、同じカードを使ってもう一種類のゲームを楽しめるのも特徴です。もう１つはバッティングゲームです。大きな荷物から船に載せますが、同じ積み荷は無効になってしまいます。こちらもエキサイティングですよ。<br/><br/>",

You must try to find out who was murdered, by what means and why.<br/><br/>The cards include Motive cards, No Clue cards and a single &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; card.  In addition, there are cards that can be assembled side by side to form larger pictures: the six guests (Cleopatra, Napoleon, etc. --they were costumed, you see; in four pieces), four weapons (also in four pieces) and Alfred Hitchcock (in six pieces).  Seven cards are dealt to each player, the rest into the house's rooms.  You enter a room by exact count, except that a 7, 11 or doubles allows you to go directly to the spot of your choice.  When you reach a room, you pick up the top card there and discard either it or another card from your hand to the &quot;Lawn&quot; --off the board.  These cards are laid face down without overlapping each other but are shown to the other players as they're laid down.  Later, you may try to recover a Lawn card by showing a card from your hand of the appropriate type (a piece of a guest, for example) and then pointing to a Lawn card and picking it up.  If you remembered right, you may repeat the procedure.  You can also claim cards from other players by meeting them in the house and &quot;accusing them&quot; of withholding a particular card (this is what the No Clue cards are defence for).  Once the rooms are empty, everyone gathers in the hall and play is speeded up.<br/><br/>First player to assemble a Ghost, Weapon and Motive OR Alfred and &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; wins.<br/><br/>",

In 1977 the Mishler Company purchased the rights for NORAD. Only minor changes were made on the game board and the unit counters. However, several changes were made in the rules, and the solitaire game was completely re-done and the 'Assigned Targets' optional rule was added. The historical simulation aspect was improved by giving the American player the capability to hide the exact location of his/her fighters. Also, the Russian bombers may no longer fly endlessly back and forth across the game board. In addition, several rules and the number of units was changed to balance the game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

They just peck at things randomly, making a mess of the house.<br/><br/>The game consists of fifty number cards (0-49), seven penalty cards, and three reward cards. Adjust the number deck based on the player count, then deal cards evenly to all players. After receiving their cards, players order the cards in their hand however they wish, but then cannot change the order during play. Each round starts with the active player playing the leftmost or rightmost card in their hand, then everyone else does the same in clockwise order, again playing only their  leftmost or rightmost card. Whoever plays the highest valued card takes the trick, then leads to the next trick. If you take a trick with more than one chicken in it, you take a penalty card equal to the number of chickens you took; if you take a trick with exactly one pig in it, then you receive a reward card that gives you a bonus in the next round, such as playing your card face down or playing from any spot in your hand.<br/><br/>Once all the cards have been played, players tally their scores: each chicken claimed in -1 point, penalty cards are -3 to -15 points, and reward cards are +3 points. Whoever took the last trick can choose to ignore all chickens they took or all penalty cards they took other than those taken on the last trick. If someone uses the 0 to beat the 49 in the last trick, then they can alternatively erase the entire score from a previous game.<br/><br/>Play as many games as the number of players, then whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

Make your best guess in Over/Under, the party game of estimating far-out facts.<br/><br/>In the game, which was first published as Die Gr&ouml;&szlig;e macht's! in German, players start with a stack of question cards, with each card having three questions and the game having 200 cards. On a turn, the active player reads one question to the other players, who then collectively decide on a numerical answer for that question. The reader must then state whether the answer given is too high, too low, or exactly right. If the reader guesses wrong, he removes the card from the game and the next player chooses the next question; if he guessed &quot;over&quot; or &quot;under&quot; and was right, he keeps the card, then passes the deck; if he guessed &quot;exactly right&quot; and was right, he keeps the card, then reads the next question himself. Bonus!<br/><br/>When the stack of cards runs out, the game ends and whoever has the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

All of the important generals are here: George Washington, Benedict Arnold, Lafayette,&quot;Mad Anthony&quot; Wayne, &quot;Gentleman John&quot; Burgoyne, Francis (&quot;Swamp Fox&quot;) Marion, Howe, Cornwallis, etc. Special rules flesh out the men, and their unique abilities and liabilities. The game system is fast paced, and creates a challenging situation for both sides.<br/><br/>IN ADDITION TO THE FULL CAMPAIGN GAME, there are four shorter campaign scenarios. The Invasion of Canada follows the fortunes of Arnold and Montgomery, as they attempt to add a 14th Colony to those in rebellion. Saratoga 1777 covers the British attempt to conquer the Hudson Valley. Summer 1780 features the British attempt to separate the colonies of the Deep South from their rebellious brethren to the North, and finally Greene's Carolina Campaign follows the attempt by Nathaniel Greene to rectify the previous year's failure by Horatio Gates.<br/><br/>THE RULES cover Militia, promotions, supply, leader exchanges', entrenchements, initiative, attrition, politics, Indians, and even Lord Germain. The naval rules cover amphibious assaults, interception at sea, ocean transport, and blockade. Counters represent regiments, naval squadrons, leaders, artillery, Indians, the French, etc. <br/>Each turn represents 2 weeks, or a month (in winter), with strategic interphases between turns. Victory is determined by the relative standing of the two sides on a Political Track, which is in turn, determined by a variety of events and by control of the vatious colonies. <br/>The British player generally moves first in each game turn, but the American, player may, by the accumulation of Victory Points, acquire and use (at the moment of his choosing) Initiative Chits, which enable him to reverse the order of movement-s-thus seizing the initiative.<br/><br/>Designed by award-winning designer Rob Markham, Give Me Liberty! is both an accurate and detailed simulation, and also a fast paced and intense game.<br/><br/>CONTENTS: <br/><br/>    One rulebook <br/>    Two 34&quot; x 22&quot; maps<br/>    400 die&middot;cut counters<br/>    One 10&middot;sided<br/><br/><br/>PLAYERS: 2&middot;4,also makes an excellent solitaire game.<br/><br/>PLAYING TIME: 2-6 hours, depending upon scenario chosen.<br/><br/>",

It is a multi-colored tree that you may grow or shrink, and you must overcome its challenge to escape. Specifically, you have to insert all your wooden pieces in the tree trunk and capture a precise number of your opponents' trunk pieces. Be smart and skilled, and you will succeed. Otherwise, you will turn into a mushroom and spend one thousand years near the tree with all the ones who missed before you!<br/><br/>All players start Arbra Kadabra with ten wooden trunk pieces in your color, with the die (showing 1/1/2/2/3/3) and the base of the tree in the center of the table. On a turn, you roll the die, then either add a number of pieces to the tree or remove a number of pieces to the tree equal to the number that you rolled. (If the tree is too short to take pieces, then you must add them.)<br/><br/>When you add pieces to the tree, you must add pieces of your own color first. Once you have no more pieces of your color, you can instead place pieces of other players' colors. Why would you have pieces of their color? Two reasons: (1) When you remove pieces from the tree, you must take them from the top down; you can't remove pieces from the center of the tree. (2) If the tree collapses on your turn, then you must take all of the pieces that fell and add them to your collection.<br/><br/>What are you trying to do with all this building and unbuilding? To win the game, you must have none of your own pieces in front of you. In addition, you must have exactly four of the opponent's pieces in a two-player game, exactly three of each opponent's pieces in a three-player game, or exactly two of each opponent's pieces in a four-player game. Do this first, and you win!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is quite simple and definitely family fare. Players race mules and men to the end of the track and back. However, it has some interesting features, particularly in the determination of the winner. Depending upon the number of players, in addition to the mules, there are either 1 or 2 men in the race, each of a unique color. Each player guides either a mule or a man. On a turn, two color dice are rolled and the appropriate tokens moved forward. If two of the same color are rolled, then that token moves backwards one space. Simple enough so far.<br/><br/>The twist is that the next player may opt to keep intact one of the dice and only roll the remaining die. This subtle rules twist allows for some 'catch-up' ability, as well as some nice hoseage as it makes it possible to move one player's token on several consecutive turns if all players keep that die intact. This may sound like a good thing for the affected player, but in reality being the first to cross the finish line is NOT always the best occurrence. What? Well, the game has a very clever mechanism to determine the winner.<br/><br/>If you are the first player to have your token cross the finish line, then you only win if the last piece remaining on the track is a man piece. Otherwise, if the final piece remaining is a mule, then that player is the winner! So, you have to make a judgment during the game as to whether you want to try to finish first or last, then attempt to move the other pieces accordingly.<br/><br/>",

In this dice game of strategy and chance inspired by the art of Steven Rhodes, will you aim to unleash your point-gaining abilities, or plan ahead with powerful dice manipulation? Gain points during an opponent's turn and watch their good fortune become another path to your success. Be the first to reach your full potential and transform from zero to hero!<br/><br/>The game is played over 3 rounds. The player with the most points at the end of the 3rd round wins.<br/><br/>PLAYING A ROUND<br/>Players take turns rolling and resolving their dice individually. This continues until a player has unlocked all 10 of their ability cards, or only one player is left in the round.<br/><br/>ON YOUR TURN<br/>When it is your turn to roll, follows these steps in order:<br/>1. Roll Dice<br/>Begin your turn by rolling your player dice and Power dice together.<br/>Each of your opponents rolls their Power dice only.<br/>2. Opponents Score<br/>Each of your opponents gains 1 point for each of their Power dice that matches BOTH 1 of their unlocked (faceup) ability cards AND at least 1 of your dice (either your player dice or Power dice).<br/>3. Use Unlocked Abilities<br/>Next, you (and only you) may use any number of your unlocked (faceup)ability cards, in any order.<br/>4. Unlock New Abilities<br/>After you use your abilities, add up the numbers on only your player dice to determine your player dice total (and apply any modifiers from unlocked ability cards if desired).<br/>Then choose a combination of your locked (facedown) ability cards that add up exactly to your player dice total, and flip each of them faceup to unlock it.<br/>You must choose a combination of cards that are ALL locked. For example, if your #1 card is already unlocked, you may not choose any combination of cards that include a 1 (regardless of what you rolled).<br/>If you have no combination of locked cards that add up to your player dice total, you may not unlock any new cards and are instead out of the round.<br/>After unlocking cards, your turn is over.<br/><br/>There are 3 types of abilities:<br/>● Power Die Ability (#1-6): In order to use a Power die ability, you must roll the matching number on at least 1 of your Power dice.<br/>● Modify Player Dice Total (#7-9): Once you have unlocked one of these abilities, you may use it once per turn to modify your player dice total for unlocking new abilities (see Step 4). Do not change the die faces you rolled when modifying your total.<br/>● Extra Power Die (#10): Once you unlock your yellow Power die, you may roll it for the rest of the round.<br/><br/>    1. Power Die: Gain points equal to 1 of your dice.<br/>    2. Power Die: Gain a reroll token.<br/>    3. Power Die: Steal 3 points from another player.<br/>    4. Power Die: Score 1 point for each of your locked cards.<br/>    5. Power Die: Score 1 point for each of your unlocked cards.<br/>    6. Power Die: Choose a player to lose half their points, rounded down.<br/>    7. You may subtract 1 from your roll.<br/>    8. You may add 1 to your roll.<br/>    9. You may remove any 1 die from your roll.<br/>    10. Gain an additional Power die.<br/><br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player starts at one end of the board, and the goal of the game is to capture or convert the pieces of your opponent.<br/><br/>Tiles can be moved 1 place horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. You can move one level going up, there is no limitation going down. This means that you can jump on tiles of your opponent if they are at the same height or lower. In this way you convert tiles of your opponent to your own colour. Tiles always move individually: you do not move entire stacks, just the stack's top tile. When capturing, you capture the entire stack.<br/><br/>You can surrender to tiles of your opponent if they are at the same height or higher. Instead of jumping on top of the stack, you slide underneath it. Your tile is not flipped, and it keeps its own colour. It is a prisoner of that stack. But if a stack holds a majority of prisoners (more than half), there is a revolution. The prisoners become free, and the top tile (and all other tiles of the stack) change to the colour of the prisoners.<br/><br/>The game ends if one of the players can make no more moves.<br/><br/>A winner of the 1995 Concours International de Créateurs de Jeux de Société.<br/><br/>",

To achieve this you will have to put into operation all your skills and you will also have a team that will help you stabilize the patient, such as atropine, oxygen, defibrillator, cardiac monitor, etc.<br/><br/>Playing at 10 Beats is to face a puzzle that must be solved following a correct sequence. If it is achieved, 10 Beats offers different levels of difficulty that can be added and that will increase the stress of the games, as if you were in an emergency room.<br/><br/>It is recommended that, at the beginning, the difficulty levels are not used, but simply trying to solve the correct sequence of the puzzle. In case of a microinfarction, the patient should be stabilized as soon as possible. If the game is finished without having achieved it, it is convenient to look at the sequence on the table and try to find the correct sequence. It's not easy, but it's not impossible either.<br/><br/>Although 10 Beats is a game of 2 to 4 players, you can count on the help of more people to help solve the puzzle.<br/><br/>We are waiting for you in the emergency room.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t=================================================El objetivo de 10 Latidos es estabilizar a un paciente consiguiendo 10 latidos libres de microinfartos. Para lograrlo tendr&eacute;is que poner en funcionamiento todas vuestras habilidades y dispondr&eacute;is adem&aacute;s de un equipo que os ayudar&aacute; a estabilizar al paciente, como la atropina, el ox&iacute;geno, el desfibrilador, el monitor card&iacute;aco, etc.<br/><br/>Jugar a 10 Latidos es enfrentarse a un puzle que hay que resolver siguiendo una secuencia correcta. Si se consigue, 10 Latidos ofrece diferentes niveles de dificultad que se podr&aacute;n ir a&ntilde;adiendo y que har&aacute;n aumentar el estr&eacute;s de las partidas, como si se estuviera en una sala de urgencias.<br/><br/>Se recomienda que, al principio, no se usen los niveles de dificultad, sino que se intente simplemente resolver la secuencia correcta del puzle. En caso de que se produzca un microinfarto, hay que estabilizar al paciente lo antes posible. Si se termina la partida sin haberlo conseguido, conviene fijarse en la secuencia que hay sobre la mesa, e intentar  encontrar la secuencia correcta. No es f&aacute;cil, pero tampoco imposible.<br/><br/>Aunque 10 Latidos es un juego de 2 a 4 jugadores, se puede contar con la ayuda de m&aacute;s personas que colaboren a resolver el puzle.<br/><br/>Os esperamos en la sala de urgencias.<br/><br/>",

The Casino always wins!<br/><br/>In Las Vegan, cards in four colors numbered from 0 to 9 are dealt to the players. The first player lays down any card from their hand. The other players have to play cards of the same color if they have them, and the highest value wins the deal. If they don't have the color, they can discard a card of another color or play a 0 from another color to win the deal. When all the cards have been played, the round is over and it's time to score. Certain coin and card combinations score points and give a chance to spin the wheel to earn coins.<br/><br/>The game ends at the end of the fourth round or when a player has lost all of their coins. At that point, whoever has the most coins wins.<br/><br/>",

For this, they roll two dice and choose one of them for their movement. The field they land on contains instructions on how to draw or replace cards or even request them from others. Afterwards, phases can be laid out or added to. At the end of each player's turn, a card has to be discarded. A player who has no cards left after this moves forward two phases, the other players who have completed the current phase move forward to the next phase, all others have to try the current phase again in the next round.

        "description": "Heroes of the Three Kingdoms is a light strategic card game with 75 unique renderings of legendary heroes of the Three Kingdom period. The deck consists of 75 hero cards in five colors with three types of icons (goblet, sword and fan) and 25 contract cards, and each player starts a round with a random hand of three hero cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player lays down 1-5 hero cards or 1-5 contract cards; played hero cards must share either a color or an icon. If she lays down hero cards, she can steal one card of the same color or with the same icon from each of her neighbors. (If her cards share both color and icon, then she must steal cards of the same color or icon.) She then adds these cards to her holdings, sorted by color.<br/><br/>With each contract card, a player can either scout &mdash; meaning she steals the topmost card from any opponent's hero stack and adds it to her holdings &mdash; or secure a color by placing the contract card on one color of hero stack in front of her. When she does this, the player with the most cards of this color removes one card of this color and places it under her castle card as a point; in case of ties, all players score. The hero cards under a contract card cannot be stolen by a scout, but they can be covered by additional hero cards. After either move, a player then refills her hand to five cards.<br/><br/>When the deck runs out, keep playing until each player has had the same number of turns, then score each color of hero cards, with the player who has the most of a color scoring three points and the secondmost player one point. Record the points, then shuffle the cards. The game lasts as many rounds as the number of players, and whoever has the high score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once upon a time a good and virtuous girl found her prince charming and lived happily ever after. Good bedtime story. But life isn&rsquo;t a fairy tale, and what parents have told us often goes beyond the truth. Heroes of fairy tales had to fight for their rights, often in a brutal way...and they did not always win. Welcome to the grim world where a road lined with dead bodies of enemies leads to a happy ending!<br/><br/>The goal of GrimmoiR is to defeat the opponent's character. At the beginning of the game, each player chooses six characters and take five energy points; the randomly selected first player begins the first round with one energy point less. The first player chooses and puts one character in the front line on the table. Then second player places their first character in front of that character and second character in the back line, right behind their first character. The first player selects the next two characters, places one to the back line behind the already placed character, and the second to the front line on any side of already placed cards. Repeat the process until each player has six characters in the battlefield: three in the front, and three in the back.<br/><br/>Players take one action in turn. They pay energy points for the action. The action includes:<br/><br/><br/>     Character activation<br/>     Movement of the character<br/><br/><br/>The player pays one energy point to activate the character. Activation includes both attack and the use of character special skills. If a player wants to activate a tired character, they can do it, but they must pay two energy points. A player can't activate a tired character if any of their characters is still ready.<br/><br/>The game lasts until one of the players defeats all of the opponent's characters.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Originally published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #256 (May/Jun 2009).<br/><br/>Marlborough&rsquo;s Battles: Ramillies and Malplaquet is a wargame of intermediate complexity, designed by Richard H. Berg, covering two of the Duke&rsquo;s great victories in the War of the Spanish Succession: Ramillies, a massive cavalry clash, and Malplaquet, a hue infantry battle. The period in which Marlborough fought was a transition between the musket-and-pike era and the more fluid, if still massed, tactics that emerged with Frederick the Great. The key transitional mechanic was the invention of the socket bayonet, which allowed gun-armed infantry to use their weapon for shock as well as fire combat. The battles fought in the War of the Spanish Succession were the first major engagements in which that innovation was used, and the commanders hadn&rsquo;t yet learned to appreciate its value. Warfare in that era was therefore mostly still formalized, rigid and stolid.<br/><br/>The map scale is 225 yards per hex. Each double-length infantry unit is composed of, on an average, four battalions and contains about 2,000 to 3,000 tightly packed men. The square infantry counters (for use in Malplaquet) each represent about half that number. Cavalry units each contain about five or six squadrons, about 600 mounted men. Artillery units each represent 12 to 18 guns. There is no per-turn time scale, as there are no distinct game turns. The game simply starts and then keeps going until one player wins. To accomplish that the system uses a &ldquo;continuation activation&rdquo; mechanic.<br/><br/>",

However, the board has multiple underwater reefs --if you cross one your ship will sail on, but your treasure will be caught on the reef and sink back to the bottom of the sea. Negotiating the maze to carry your treasure back to your port without losing it on reefs is the main challenge of the game.<br/><br/>Treasure chests when opened have a value from 0 to 4 coins written in the chest lid that is only seen by popping the chest open once back at your home port. The first player with 10 points in treasure chests wins the game, or play highest once all chests are retrieved.<br/><br/>Players may only retrieve treasure at their home port opening. All pieces (including Sea Monster) may only move orthogonally, not diagonally. May pick up only 1 treasure chest at a time. May sail through Sea Monster Island, but not end movement there. May not sail through other players or Sea Monster. If Monster is moved onto a player they are sunk. Lift player to drop treasure where they are, return that player&amp;#039;s ship to port and the Sea Monster back to the center island.<br/><br/>Movement die is 1,2,2,3,3,4. <br/>Rolling a 1 or 4 allows you to roll the Doom Die.<br/><br/>Doom Die (also six sides)<br/>Skull and Crossbones --steal a treasure chest from another player.<br/>Storms --move a player 3 or 4 spaces (usually over reefs to lose treasure and far away from home port). <br/>Monster --move the monster 2, 3 or 4 spaces.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Russian Bank -- also known as Crapette -- is a game played by two players with two standard decks of playing cards.  Each player begins the game with a tableau four face up house cards, a 12 card reserve, and a &quot;hand&quot; consisting of the remainder of the cards.  The first player to clear their tableau, reserve, and hand of cards onto the foundation spaces in the middle of the board is the winner.  Although the rules of card placement and foundation building are similar to those of Klondike solitaire, Russian Bank allows equal access by both players to both layouts, thus adding player interaction.<br/><br/>Foundation spaces are built up in suit from ace to king.  Houses are built down in alternating colors from king to ace.<br/><br/>Some moves in the game are compulsory:<br/> -- if the top card of the reserve may be played to a foundation, that play must be made first.<br/> -- if an available card in the houses can be played to the foundations, that play must be made.<br/> -- if any house is empty, one must fill the space from the reserve if possible.<br/> -- whenever the top card from the reserve is played, the next reserve card must be turned face up.<br/><br/>If none of the above moves are available, the player turns the top card of his hand face up and continues play.  The player may play the card legally as any other card.  Likewise, a player may play a cards to his opponent's waste pile if the card played matches in suit and is of a consecutive rank.  Once a player has no more legal moves, his face-up hand it is discarded into the player's waste pile and his turn ends.  If the hand is empty when the player needs to draw a hand card, the waste pile is turned face down to refresh the hand.<br/><br/>If at any time a player makes an illegal play or ignores an opportunity to make one of the compulsory plays, his opponent may stop him, point out the error, and force the proper play.  The erring player then forfeits the remainder of that turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Marlborough: War of the Spanish Succession (&quot;Marby,&quot; for short), is a wargame of intermediate-to-high complexity, designed by Joseph Miranda, simulating that critical conflict of the early 18th century. The dynastic struggle began when France's Louis XIV attempted to place his grandson, Philip IV, on the throne of Spain. The other major powers saw that as a threat, and so supported their own candidate, Charles III. That in turn began over a decade of fighting that grew into a general struggle for domination over all of western Europe.<br/><br/>Marby is a two player game. One controls the forces of France and its allies, known as the Bourbon coalition, after the ruling house of France. The other player controls the forces opposing France, led by England and Austria and known as the Grand Alliance. Each player has a variety of military, diplomatic and economic instruments with which he can attempt to win the game by controlling states and economic centers.<br/><br/>The game includes several scenarios. Shorter scenarios represent critical parts of the war, while the &quot;Grand Design&quot; scenario covers the entire war. Certain rules are designated &quot;optional,&quot; and the players don't have to use them. The optional rules are suggested for use only when playing the Grand Design scenario, as they add considerable complexity, historical detail and playing time.<br/><br/>The 34x22&quot; large-hex map shows western and central Europe during the early 18th century. The grid of hexagons printed over the map provides locations for playing pieces and geographic features. During the game, the cardboard pieces are placed within individual hexes.<br/><br/>Each game turn represents one year; each hex scales to 50 miles. Each army represents 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers and support personnel, camp followers, etc. A leader represents that person plus his guards, entourage, lackeys, wine cellars, etc. A fleet represents 60 warships and an indeterminate number of transports. The rules run to some 17,000 words, making for play sessions lasting from four to 12 hours.<br/><br/>",

At the start of a round, someone rolls the two dice &mdash; one showing a number 4-8, the other showing a type of fruit &mdash; then players take turns laying cards in the center of the table, covering the card most recently played. Whenever someone thinks that the stack of cards contains at least as many of the required fruit as shown on the dice, they can slap the stack and reveal the cards. If they're correct, they keep one card face up as a point and distribute the other cards among the opponents; if incorrect, they must keep all of the cards.<br/><br/>While this part of the game is straightforward, some cards include minions that require you to reroll either the number or fruit die, thereby changing what you're trying to collect in the salad. Can you keep track of everything?<br/><br/>",

Players then place that letter on their personal game board.  Empty spaces on the central board are filled randomly from the bag, then the board is rotated clockwise and players select a new letter tile from those available to them.<br/><br/>Players are attempting to build four letter words only.  Once a four letter word is completed, that word is immediately scored and the letter tiles are returned to the bag.

Which of the combatants, Order or Chaos, shall win? And can the forces of Neutrality maintain the precarious balance of power . . . An exciting, fast moving game of movement and combat in a fantastic world, where skill and strategy will decide the winner.&quot;<br/><br/>From the Introduction: &quot;It is a game of two to six players, each player being represented by a leader in the game. Players must decide before the game starts whether to be a Lord or Wizard. In addition, a player must also decide whether his leader is to follow Order, Neutrality, or Chaos. These three alignments determine the type of leader, and what that leader can do during the game.&quot;<br/><br/>From the Designer's Notes: &quot;Lords and Wizards is not just a game; it's an experience. There is nothing quite like the feeling of outwitting an opponent on the field of battle, or in setting up grand alliances, or in stabbing allies in the back, or in discovering lost legends, or in dealing with rebellions, or in avoiding the plague, or in being confounded by the weather, or in.well, you see what I mean.&quot;<br/><br/>Components: 72 page 8.5x11&quot; rulebook, 800 die-cut counters, 28x22&quot; map sheet, 4 cardstock game cards, six-sided die, color FGU catalog folder, FGU order sheet.<br/><br/>",

The game covers the critical period of Viet Minh assaults and French counterattacks of March to May, 1954. Historically, the Viet Minh won the battle, overrunning the base. This led to the collapse of the French position in Indochina and eventual US involvement in Vietnam.<br/><br/>In Dien Bien Phu, you play the French while the game system controls the Viet Minh. The objective is for the French to hold out long enough for the fortress to be relieved, or even gain a decisive victory by breaking Viet Minh morale.<br/><br/>While a solitaire game, Dien Bien Phu can also be played by two or more players, each taking charge of different aspects of the French defense. For example, one player can be overall commander, while others command various defensive sectors, or take charge of air and artillery.<br/><br/>Modern War #17, May-June 2015.<br/><br/>",

The map depicts the Plain of Vigrid, lying between the Rainbow Bridge and the city of the gods, Asgard, where the battle takes place, and the playing pieces represent warriors, Valkyries, Frost Giants, Fire Giants, and such celebrated individuals as Odin, Thor, Loki, and the Midgard Serpent. Each player maneuvers his forces across the map in an effort to fulfill his victory conditions. To win, the player commanding the invading Jotun forces must destroy Asgard, thus bringing about Ragnarok, the twilight of the gods. The Aesir player must repel the Jotun invasion to win, thus postponing Asgard's fall.<br/><br/>Originally published in Ares Magazine #8 May 1981<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The connection to the movie is tenuous (alien-looking ships on one side) but it's Battleship, after all.  This is a throwback to the &quot;classic&quot; edition -- non-electronic with separate player boards that lock together into a futuristic-looking carrying case with a handle.<br/><br/>Play modes include:<br/><br/><br/>     The time-worn original Battleship, with each player firing a single shot each turn.<br/>     Almost equally-time-worn Salvo where you start out with five shots per turn and lose one each time one of your ships sinks.<br/>     A &quot;Special Ops&quot; mode with a card draw each turn to determine player actions.  Most of these are from 1-3 shots, but there's a variety of special actions, e.g.:<br/>         attacking an entire row or column<br/>         converting all future one-shot cards into salvoes (as in the Salvo game above)<br/>         having the other player tell you a coordinate on their ship to hit<br/>         scanning a row for number of hits (but not exactly where)<br/>         firing one shot, then drawing and playing another card<br/>    <br/>     An &quot;Advanced Special Ops&quot; mode with a hand of the above cards, and two card actions (either draw or play) per turn.  This last one can get confusing, as the rules for the cards are obviously written with the assumption that you're playing one per turn, requiring some house rules to fill in the logical holes.<br/><br/><br/>The last wrinkle is Comm Tower cards (which presumably has something to do with the movie) which persist when played.  The first player to collect four of them has their subsequent shots go nuclear, destroying the entire target regardless of size with a single hit.<br/><br/>The following is manufacturer's marketing copy, or at least written like it is:<br/><br/>Includes three exciting games in one portable case that&rsquo;s always ready for the battle. Play the traditional game, taking turns calling your shots. Or choose the Salvo game in which you stack up as many shots in one turn as you have ships afloat. Finally, call on the movie-based Special Ops cards for a third game. These strategy cards give you special powers such as Blitz, Scan, and Reveal as you plot to prevail over your enemy.<br/><br/>",

Four to six players engage in head-to-head (-to-head-to-head) constant combat until the frenzy peaks and one player emerges victorious.<br/><br/>Set in an alternate 1920s, an eclectic collection of some of the world&rsquo;s greatest fighters are pitted against each other by the magnanimous Baron Reginald Fistcuffington Smythe aboard his monolithic floating airship. Baron Smythe, inventor of the new super-element Hydrolium, offers the winner of his &quot;Fisticuffs Bouts&quot; the granting of a single wish, whatever their heart desires most. The surviving fighter will get their wish fulfilled - and become champion of Fisticuffs!<br/><br/>Gameplay is simple. Each player picks a fighter from our cast of characters, each with their own backstory and special move. The stable of fighters include a sky pirate, a flapper, a saxo-magician, the son of a slain Chicago mayor, and a robot built by Baron Smythe himself. Every player gives their fiercest battle cry, and whoever&rsquo;s is best begins the game.<br/><br/>Each player starts with five cards from the Punch Card deck. These Punches will be a fighter&rsquo;s offense and defense. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they throw a Punch against any opponent - but that player can Block if they are holding a Punch of the same name. This leaves the attacking player open for a Counter, allowing the defending player to attack with a Punch that is the same color as their Block.<br/><br/>Combat continues until a Punch goes un-Blocked or a Block goes un-Countered. When an attack successfully lands, the defending player loses health. Everybody starts at 12, and when they reach 0, they&rsquo;re knocked out for the rest of the match. Every remaining player gets a turn each round.<br/><br/>Once a full round (one turn for everybody) has been completed, the fighters return to their corner. This is when you draw new Punch Cards - and when you get a Round Card, a special action that will help provide a tactical advantage by giving you more attacks, depleting an opponent&rsquo;s defenses, or giving you the edge you need in the middle of combat. The new round begins to the left of the person who started the last round.<br/><br/>The rounds keep going until there are two boxers left, at which point they enter Close Combat - no more rounds, no more Round Cards, just two boxers fighting over one dream. The fighter that is left standing is the winner of the bout and the champion of Fisticuffs!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Last Stand at Isandlwana, 22 January 1879 is a two-player tactical wargame of low-intermediate complexity simulating the last 90 to 240 minutes of that infamous and legendary battle of the Anglo-Zulu War. The Zulu player is on the offensive, attempting to wipe out the entire British force on the map as quickly as possible. The British is attempting to win by having some remnant hold out longer than occurred historically or, alternatively, by having some portion of his command escape off the map and get back to relative safety at Roarke&rsquo;s drift. Solitaire-play is easily doable. Each game turn of Last Stand is equal to five to 20 minutes of &ldquo;real time,&rdquo; depending on the tempo of action in each turn. Each hexagon on the 22x34&rdquo; map represents 217 yards (200 meters) from side to opposite side. There are 176 5/8&rdquo; counters with each British unit-counter representing a company or a &ldquo;detachment&rdquo; of infantry. On the Zulu side, they individual units each represent temporary battlefield agglomerations of the about 100 to 200 warriors.<br/><br/>Magazine: Strategy &amp; Tactics #314<br/><br/>",

Namely &quot;Spark&quot; the hot shot, &quot;Teaser&quot; the flaming girl, &quot;Double Boiler&quot; the fire fighter, and the huge but very slow &quot;Ice Breaker&quot;. All have gathered in front of a nearby cave entrance with the intention of collecting as many treasures as possible.<br/><br/>However, deep inside this cave, the Red Hot Silly Dragon is lying comfortably on his mountain of gold, and he is not ready to share his colossal wealth. He will not hesitate to breath his magic fire on anybody getting too close to his savings.<br/><br/>So caution Hot stuff, Who will dare enter the dragons lair? Who will manage to bring back the most treasures?<br/><br/>The basic principle of this small risk taking game is extremely simple. During each round of play, all players simultaneously choose an adventurer, from the four of their respective team, which they wish to send into the cave to recover treasures.<br/><br/>This choice will be done according to a &quot;crystal ball&quot; prediction, which is never highly reliable.<br/><br/>So players must bear in mind the power and the range of the flame of the dragon, and the &quot;fire resistance&quot; of each adventurer (from very weak for Spark, to very high for Ice Breaker). Also because the cave is narrow the placement of the adventurers in the cave is very limited.<br/><br/>An ascending order of fire resistances will be carried out. In fact, the more resistant an adventurer is, the slower he runs. In other words, the more you take a risk, the higher your choice of placement will be, but the more likely it is your adventurer will get scorched.<br/><br/>Lastly, to protect your valorous adventurers from the small sudden changes of mood of the dragon (anger, fury...) as well as the various tricks of your adversaries, who will surely never miss an opportunity to prevent you from recovering treasures, you will have at your disposal a complete set of magic items tailor-made for this kind of &quot;sport&quot; so it's up to you to use them wisely.<br/><br/>The winner will obviously be the player who has piled up the most treasures at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

A swirling darkness coalesces in the night sky over a field as you, one of five Witches, perform incantations to vie for Earthly prominence, calling upon five Goddesses for protection and favor... But which of your fellow Witches serve the light, and which the dark? Gather information and form alliances, cast hexes, and use all your wit and connivance to ensure your dominance. Serve your Goddesses well, and they will reward you above their other followers, as they cast down those who dare to oppose them.<br/><br/>Coven is a game of secret alignments for 3-5 players in which each player represents a Witch serving either the darkness or the light. Not only is your starting alignment a secret, but each of the five non-player Goddesses has an unknown alignment as well. Deducing which Goddess(es) and which other player(s) share your alignment will make your strategy clear and victory easier to achieve, but not guaranteed by any means. Gameplay is deceptively simple, with five possible actions as players traverse a circular board with an inner pentagram rotating widdershins changing tactics with each rotation. Coven presents an interesting strategic challenge: the side (Light or Dark) that scores the most Balance defeats the opposing side &mdash; but on the dominating side, only the Witch that scores the most Power can win, so players must be careful not to invest too much in one while neglecting the other.<br/><br/>Coven includes five playable characters (along with their miniatures) &ndash; Witches of Earth, Water, Spirit, Air and Fire. The game also includes a Goddess Power/Balance board, Black and White magic crystals, hidden alignment tokens, &quot;reversal&quot; alignment crosses (for players who dare to change sides), Artifact Cards and Balance cards,  a Goddess Board,  and a two piece circular playing board with a rotating pentagram.<br/><br/>",

Units that are out of command range can only switch to Maneuver orders or stay in reserve. Orders affect melee and fire strength and also the strength of a unit's Zone of Control.

The game board is a grid which alternately shows production areas and spaces for tiles; these tiles show a player color and number, e.g., red 4 or blue 2. A production area grants its building materials or silver to the player with the highest combined value on the adjacent tile edges. The tiles start face-down, and each turn, one of them is revealed. During their turns, players can rotate the tiles, thus influencing who gains which building materials, which are subsequently used to build castles.<br/><br/>With the unusual turning mechanism of the tiles, every player has the power to distribute the raw materials between himself and the other players on each turn. Building castles then results in victory points, depending on the positions of the villages and cities &ndash; and that's what it's all about if you want to become the most successful landlord!<br/><br/>The two expansion modules included &ndash; &quot;Dilemma&quot; and &quot;Battle&quot; &ndash; can be combined freely with the basic game.

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>&quot;When you launch a rocket, you're not really flying that rocket. You're just sort of hanging on.&quot; Michael P. Anderson<br/><br/>It's 150 years in the future and mankind has spread throughout the solar system. To supply far-flung colonies, they look to the Rocket Jockeys! The planets depend on timely cargo arrivals &ndash; but this is not enough for the rocket jockeys. They compete with one another to see who can complete the fanciest maneuvers, transport the most important cargo, and visit the most planets.<br/><br/>In Rocket Jockey, you must be daring and you must be quick. You must also be tough, for first contact with alien life is near at hand. Deliver your cargo with the most flair and speed and you will win the game!<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Place 9 numbered planet cards in a row, with a random cargo card, showing a DIFFERENT destination planet, under each one. Players are each dealt 2 maneuver cards, which allow maneuver between 2 specific planets; the rest of these cards forms a draw deck, from which 3 are placed face up. Players also each start with 4 Copilot cards. The 2nd time through the maneuver deck, shuffle an Alien card into the bottom several cards.<br/><br/>On your turn, draw a maneuver card from the deck, the 3 face up cards, or the top of the discard pile. Then, either draw another or make a delivery run. When making runs, may start on any planet and pick up that cargo; use maneuver cards to chain, until you get to destination planet. If possible, may pick up that cargo and begin new chain ... all stops in these consecutive chains count towards the number of stops; chains with more stops are worth more VP. Alternatively, may make multiple deliveries with different starts/ends, but you must calculate VP for each such chain separately. Save all delivered cargo in your score pile; at end of game, you get bonus VP for having visited more planets. You can use Copilot cards in 2 ways:<br/>- use max 1/maneuver card, to alter one of the 2 planets shown by 1<br/>- place on a cargo to reserve it until your next turn; if someone else takes it, they lose 5VP; if you fail to make the run next turn, you lose 5VP and the card. Otherwise, you get your card back next turn.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, draw up to a hand size of 2 (if you had fewer), then replenish the face up display. If you reveal the alien, place it at just beyond Pluto. At the end of each turn, it advances 1 step. Alternatively, it can be picked up like cargo and delivered to Earth. Score planets at the end of each run through the deck. The game ends immediately if the Aliens get to Earth; most VP (from deliveries during game + bonus for number of planets delivered to) wins!<br/><br/>",

Each player receives challenge cards to be carried out; these challenges are based on dexterity or mental abilities such as being the first super hero who takes off his socks and puts them back on, the first to turn in a circle five times, the first to calculate the sum of the ages of all players. Once the challenge cards are in hand, a player challenges another super hero. They mix their cards, draw one randomly, then try to achieve the challenge. The one who wins keeps the card.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, when players have played all of their challenge cards, the one with the most cards is declared the strongest super hero in the world!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Antartik is a game for two to five players aged 5 and up, who embody penguins facing each other in a diving contest. They jump from the ice shelf, in the middle of Antarctica. The penguins must perform the most impressive series of artistic figures while avoiding a disastrous belly flop, which never goes unnoticed by the well-skilled jury.<br/><br/>The game is made of 55 cards, numbered from 1 to 10. There is only one card marked 1, whereas there are two cards marked 2, three cards marked 3, etc., and ten cards marked 10. Some cards marked 8, 9, and 10 also feature a bonus symbol in the top left corner, representing a judge or a parachute.<br/><br/>Game flow<br/>Each player takes turn trying to make up a series of figures during his dive. He can perform three kinds of actions until his turn ends:<br/><br/>     Either drawing a card and place it in the center of the table so as to complete his series of figures. If the player draws a card which number already appears on one of the cards of the series, he keeps the last card he drew and his turn ends. The next player will choose either to keep the current series, or to return the series&rsquo; cards to the bottom of the deck.<br/>     Or stopping the current series and taking all the cards it is made of before a pair is formed. The player&rsquo;s turn ends.<br/>     Or discarding a card with a &quot;Judge&quot; symbol to examine the top three cards in the deck and rearrange them in the order of his choice.<br/><br/><br/>Before performing any of these three actions, the active player must wait for each of his opponents to:<br/><br/>     Either raise his hand in agreement.<br/>     Or place (once per player during a series of figures) one of his cards in front of the active player&rsquo;s series so as to confront him, and dare him to perform another figure. If the active player refuses the challenge or accepts it and loses, his turn ends and the player who dared him takes his card back and turns it over; now the card is worth 3 stars. If the active player accepts the challenge and succeeds, he immediately takes the card that was bet, he puts it in his stock and his turn goes on.<br/><br/><br/>At any time, a player can turn over a card won during a successful challenge (i.e., a face down card) and draw the card at the bottom of the deck.<br/><br/>End of game<br/>The game ends when the last card of the deck is drawn. The cards face up are worth one or two stars whereas the cards face down (from a successful bet) are worth three stars. The player with most stars wins the game and the title of &quot;Antarctic Champion Diver&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The playing surface consists of 36 tiles laid out numerically to form a square. Each tile contains spots which form a pathway; some form straight paths, some are angled paths and some form crossroads. As players advance their tokens along the paths, they also move the tiles in an attempt to bottle up opponents while building the shortest possible path to the Finish for themselves.  Thus, the pathway is continuously shifting, branching out, and breaking into segments.<br/><br/>Also published in 1965 as a promotional game for Culligan, title &quot;Hey, Culligan Man!&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A Pietjesbak (or Pitjesbak, translated: Seedsbox) is an 8 sided wooden box covered with felt. It has a diameter of approximately 38 cm. The game is played in the box using 3 regular D6 dice. You also need a piece of chalk for scoring.<br/><br/>There are different playing versions of this game. Special houserules/pubrules are common.<br/><br/>The most common rules:<br/>Each player gets 15 points to start with (or 9 for a short game), marked with chalk on their side of the Pietjesbak.  The purpose is to get the highest score within 3 rolls and with that lose all his points.  The starting player can roll any/all three dice up to 3 times. Each other player gets as many rolls as the first player, and tries to get a higher score.<br/><br/>One counts as 100, 6 counts as 60,  the other numbers count as their face value. Special combinations have a higher score. The highest score wins the round and the player can reduce their score by 1, 2 or 3.<br/><br/>The different scores (from lowest to highest):<br/><br/>     3 numbers that are not one of the special combinations below. The dice are added together. Example: 1,2,6 = 100+2+60 = 162. The winner reduces their score by 1.<br/>     Zand/Sand, 3 identical numbers. Example: 3,3,3. The higher the better (except: 1,1,1 aka Drie Apen). The winner reduces their score by 2.<br/>     Soixante-Neuf/Sixty-Nine (4,5,6 = 4+5+60 = 69). The winner reduces their score by 3.<br/>     Drie Apen/Three Apes (1,1,1 = 100+100+100 = 300, which is unbeatable). With this score you instantly win the game.<br/><br/><br/>To summarize (with out-of-sequence ranks in bold-italics): 300 &gt; 69 &gt; triple-six 180 &gt; triple-five 15 &gt; triple-four 12 &gt; triple-three 9 &gt; triple-two 6 &gt; 260 &gt; 220 &gt; 205 &gt; 204 &gt; 203 &gt; 202 &gt; 165 &gt; 164 &gt; 163 &gt; 162 &gt; 125 &gt; ...&gt; 122 &gt; 110 &gt;...&gt; 104 &gt; 70 &gt; 68 &gt;...&gt; 64 &gt; 14 &gt;...&gt; 7 (lowest 2,2,3)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to a land where creation is but a simple step away from ingenuity plus a few simple resources imbued with ancient alchemy - this is Alkemia.  Prepare to harness the primal art of alchemy and to join the ranks of creators who have been shaping and reforming the raw land of Alkemia into a thriving livelihood centered on a grand city of alchemy deemed Crasis.  Governed by a circle of seers and a single Grand Alchemist, who wields boundless talent and protects the ancient secrets of the Greater Elemental Spirits, Crasis now seeks its next Grand Alchemist, who will be one of the few alchemists attempting to prove their abilities by synthesizing the legendary Crest of Creation.  This crest, a fabled mysticism documented to usher the golden age of alchemy and balance, can only be crafted by one skilled alchemist able to harness the five elements of earth, fire, water, air, and ether, using both natural and manufactured resources.<br/><br/>Take to the urban bazaars and elemental wilds of a land that is enriched by the power of alchemy blessed by the elements.  Players can look forward to managing organic resources as one of six characters to craft powerful items in a race to become the Grand Alchemist.  First, harvest the Foraging Fields to gather your base reagents and collect recipes used to craft items; then, alchemists will combine their base reagents to synthesize items from their recipes &ndash; all with usable effects aimed to both assist the creator and hinder competitors. <br/> Players will ultimately quell everything at their disposal to create their own legendary Crest of Creation via a randomly generated recipe gained through playing, which will lead the most skilled alchemist to victory.  Do you have what it takes to be worthy of the Crest of Creation?  Be prepared, for Destiny&rsquo;s recipe calls for you<br/><br/>",
