        "description": "Operation OVERLORD was the historic invasion of the European continent and the beginning of the battle to breach the &ldquo;impenetrable&rdquo; Atlantic Wall. Drop Zone: Sainte-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise is the opening act that takes place in and around the sleepy Norman country town of Sainte-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise located behind Utah Beach, a crucial crossroads for the U.S. Fourth Infantry Division as it fought its way inland. Ten days before D-Day, the plans for dropping the 82nd Airborne Division shifted it from the west side of the Cotentin Peninsula over to the east side, closer to Utah Beach, and responsibility for capturing Sainte-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise shifted from the 101st Airborne Division to the 82nd, specifically the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment. Second and Third Battalions, under Lt. Colonels Benjamin Vandervoort and Edward Krause respectively, found themselves tasked with protecting the vital crossroads from German counterattacks aimed at bottling up the Americans on Utah Beach. Facing the paratroopers and the units driving off the beaches were a mixed bag of defenders: Georgians of the coastal defense unit Ost Bataillon 795, Infanterie-Division 709; regular troops from Grenadier-Regiment 1058, Luftlande-Infanterie-Division 91; and the well-equipped Sturm-Bataillon AOK 7&mdash;all supported by ad-hoc armor units.<br/><br/>Drop Zone: Sainte-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise is a Historical Advanced Squad Leader (HASL) module covering the first two days of the battles around the important Norman town of Sainte-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise. Each side attacks and defends in an effort to do better than their historical counterpart. Can you as the American not only hold the town but also push the German forces off the map as you expand your perimeter? Or can you as the German retake the town from the Americans and delay the invasion?<br/><br/>Drop Zone: Sainte-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise comes with three historically-accurate maps of the town of Sainte-M&egrave;re-&Eacute;glise and its environs jointly crafted by Sharon Boyd, designer Ken Dunn, and artist Charlie Kibler. Additionally, there are 11 individual scenarios each recreating a portion of the battle, as well as three Campaign Games of various sizes depicting either the entire battle or smaller portions of it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

All the games are compatible -- and they can be used to trace the evolution of tactics over the course of history from 3000 B.C. to 1550 A.D. Each game in the series covers a segment of the period, and presents the tactical situations faced by leaders of the great battles of the period.<br/><br/>User Notes:<br/>The five (5) separate games included in the hard to find PRESTAGS Master-Pack are: &quot;CHARIOT: Tactical Warfare in the 'Biblical' Age, 3000-500BC&quot;; &quot;SPARTAN: Tactical Warfare in the Hellenistic Age, 500-100BC&quot;; &quot;LEGION: Tactical Warfare in the Roman Age, 100BC-700AD&quot;; &quot;VIKING: Tactical Warfare in the Dark Ages, 700-1300&quot; and &quot;YEOMAN: Tactical Warfare in the Renaissance Age, 1250-1550&quot;. Each game in the pack comes with 400 counters, so the full set contains a whopping 2000 counters. The set is comprised of not one, but two SPI flat packs, along with maps and rules for each game, and with PRESTAGS rules that cover the full series. All the sets are compatible, or as the back of the box states, &quot;Because the strength values of the the units were all derived from the same base, units from one game are entirely compatible with another.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Where The Golden Dragon differs is in his unusually powerful Level Up ability. The first time you build out your dungeon to five cards, The Golden Dragon gains one each of all the other treasure types in the game: the Cleric&rsquo;s Ankh, The Fighter&rsquo;s Sword, and the Mage&rsquo;s Tome. That means that suddenly you&rsquo;ve got a boss who&rsquo;s contributing to your dungeon&rsquo;s attractiveness to each and every Hero type. This is huge, and this edge in bidding for Heroes makes other Boss Monsters green with envy. Just be careful... when the Epic Heroes show up in town, you'd better have a powerful dungeon to defeat all the Heroes you'll be luring!<br/><br/>In game lore, The Golden Dragon's dungeon is the most dangerous in the land of Arcadia, and heroes just can&rsquo;t resist the fame and glory that could come out of adventuring there. He&rsquo;s the ultimate Boss Monster.<br/><br/>",

New tiles introduce buildings into the game, offering players new tactical decisions in an urban environment. New rules and new super strong and inhuman heroes further immerse you into this stimulating expedition. Also included in Operation &quot;SeeL&ouml;we&quot; is the untold history of the Axis and one of the cornerstones of their forces: the Blutkreuz Korps. Uncover truths known only to a select Axis few.<br/><br/>Introducing a new level of strategy to your Dust Tactics gaming experiences, Operation &quot;SeeL&ouml;we&quot; assures that the battlefield will never be the same.<br/><br/>",

It was a long, difficult war, and lessons were learned the hard way. The terrain and conditions were brutal. There were few, if any, stand-up fights. Ambushes, helicopter assaults, raids, and cordon-and-sweep were the necessary missions, the types of squad-level missions that are ideally suited to the Lock &rsquo;n Load Tactical Series.<br/><br/>The Bear &amp; The Jackal (TB&amp;TJ) contains nine fierce firefights from the Soviet-Afghan War. It expands Heroes of the Gap, and utilizes new counters of Mujahideen and Soviet forces, including Spetsnaz special-forces units; and it&rsquo;s played on two plus-sized (approximately 9.5&rdquo; x 16.5&rdquo;) geomorphic maps. Grab an RPG-7 and find a rocky place to hide behind: there&rsquo;s a Soviet convoy coming down the road!<br/><br/>UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.

The King&rsquo;s Landing cycle takes a new approach to the Game of Thrones LCG. Rather than following the plot of A Song of Ice and Fire, this cycle is centered around the capital of Westeros, allowing you to explore the world of Westeros more freely than ever before.<br/><br/>Your journey begins at the great wall that surrounds the capital city. Aegon I Targaryen had seven gates built as the entrances to his grand metropolis in honor or the number sacred to the Faith of the Seven. Now in At the Gates, the great Houses of Westeros gain access to these blessed locations. Each gate is a low-cost location that can provide you with income from their tolls and the chance to sacrifice them in exchange for two draws if you embrace the spirit of your chosen House. Additionally, this Chapter Pack features new versions of beloved characters, embracing the plots and deadly intrigues of A Song of Ice and Fire with the continuation of the shadow keyword, first reintroduced in the Dance of Shadows cycle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

NOTE THAT YOU MUST OWN A COPY OF &quot;B-29 SUPERFORTRESS&quot; TO PLAY &quot;HELL OVER KOREA.&quot;<br/><br/>The time period covered in the Variant was chosen because it was the most dynamic period of the war for the B-29. Early missions (i.e., before November 1950) for the bomber met with little enemy opposition, with (relatively ineffective) raids against tactical targets.  North Korea&rsquo;s few strategic targets and industries were also quickly disposed of.  In November 1950, however, the Chinese Communists were in the war, and the B-29 began facing its first serious opposition with the introduction of large numbers of Soviet MiG-15 jet fighters.

        "description": "This are two full size, full color mounted maps that fold to a size that fits in both the Steam and Age of Steam boxes. At first glance, both have similar rules changes: an option to forsake delivery of goods cubes or an increase of locomotive and replace it with a special function that will be key to winning the game. But the differences between the maps and how they are played are substantial.<br/><br/>California Gold Rush takes place in the mid 1800&rsquo;s in Central California. Pockets of gold have been found, and you need to lay claim to the mines before your opponents. To do so you need to build railroads out to the gold mines and pick up the gold. The mechanics are modified slightly during the delivery phase: you always have the option of picking up any available gold cube wherever your track has been laid instead of delivering a regular good cube or increasing your locomotive. At the end of the game, each of the gold cubes increases your income (VPs in Steam) by 5. California Gold Rush is for 3-6 players.<br/><br/>Underground Railroad takes place in the years leading up to the civil war all across the Eastern United States. During the goods delivery phase, players may opt to move slaves north to a free city instead of delivering a goods cube or increasing their locomotive. They don&rsquo;t receive any income for doing so. The winner is determined by who frees the most slaves...as long as they don&rsquo;t go bankrupt before the end of the game.  Underground Railroad is for 3-5 players.<br/><br/>The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 7 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double-sided expansions. These maps can be preordered from Bezier Games and will ship in October 2010. The &ldquo;bonus&rdquo; 7th map is only available through preorders.<br/><br/>",

Instead, they can deploy anywhere on the battlefield beyond Range 3 of all enemy units.

        "description": "100 Swords is a sword based dungeon crawling micro deck builder! Load up with as much as you can carry and run head first into the dungeon, exploring rooms and revealing monsters, all while keeping track of hidden treasures and swords!<br/><br/>During play, you must efficiently play the 5 cards in your hand for any combination of movement, strength, or energy. Movement advances you deeper into the dungeon allowing you to peek at or reveal the cards along the way. Monsters you find can only be defeated with strength. New items (and swords!) are acquired by spending cards in your hand for energy. Many items have effects that will further expand your tactical options as your deck grows.<br/><br/>As you defeat monsters and pick up loot, do your best to remember where everything is hidden. Treasures and slain monsters are worth gold, so get collecting! Once the dungeon has been thoroughly ransacked, or the boss is defeated, whoever has the most gold wins!<br/><br/>You can use Dungeon Builder Sets to spice up your dungeon. Each set contains 15 cards (including a new Boss) that can be slapped onto a standalone dungeon to lengthen your game and add new challenges and puzzles to solve! The Glowing Plasmapede Dungeon Builder Set is a good all-around set of cards. It has an interesting variety of monsters and items with dungeon visibility and card manipulation effects.<br/><br/>",

For each trainer you place here (up to 2) each animal in your aquarium with a lightning bolt gets 2 bonus points. Also, all your animals with lightning bolts are no longer untrainable. So you can get additional bonus points from each trainer you place next to them in your main Water Zoo!<br/><br/>The Research Station<br/>Can only be taken by a player when they get their first coworker. That coworker is placed on one animal tile in his water park and at the end of the game he scores one point for each animal of that type in the basin the coworker was placed.<br/><br/>The Technical Area<br/>Take when you have a coworker you want to place on the tile.

Send your divers to the deep, but be careful; moving too close to other divers lets them get in on the haul too! Gather lost loot and beached baubles to assemble museum exhibits and construct eye-popping aquariums... but don't forget to save the best bits for your personal collection!<br/><br/>Wreck Raiders is an innovative dice-drafting worker placement system. Choose a die from the pool, then send one of your divers to any spot on the board with that number. But be warned: the spot you choose will help any diver in the spots next to you, whether they&rsquo;re friendly or not. Will you risk letting a rival in on your haul to get that treasure you want, or can you find a way to grab yourself some extra loot?<br/><br/>Display your treasures to build museum exhibits, or send them to your vault for huge scoring opportunities... Don&rsquo;t forget to visit the beach nearby to gather washed-up baubles and spend them to build awesome aquariums. (All sea creatures are treated ethically and released into the wild; also, they are cardboard tiles.)<br/><br/>When the game ends, you&rsquo;ll earn coins for your exhibits, your vault, and your aquariums. The player with the most coins wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Cavern of Gandum is a dwarven legend that has been passed down through the millenia. The legend tells of a Dwarf wizard, Gandum, who created a powerful relic called the Mana Stone. It was created with the power to infuse magical energy into ordinary rock.<br/><br/>The Dragon Lord Rizz, mad with greed, obsessed over the power of the Mana Stone. He lured Gandum into an ambush within Treasure Mountain. They fought for hours, but in the end, Rizz mortally wounded Gandum. To keep Rizz from controlling the power of the Mana Stone, Gandum cast himself and the Mana Stone into a subterranean abyss. Lord Rizz spent the rest of his life searching for the Mana Stone, but it was never found.<br/><br/>That is, until a group of dwarven miners uncovered vast caverns filled with glowing crystals, infused with magic from the Mana Stone. Deep in the heart of Treasure Mountain, the miners had discovered the Caverns of Gandum, proving the legend true and unleashing the magic of the Mana Stone.<br/><br/>The Cavern of Gandum introduces two exciting new elements to Treasure Mountain: spells and the automa deck.  It is recommended you become familiar with the base game before playing with this expansion.<br/><br/>Spells allow you to bend the rules of the game while placing dwarves, collecting resources, and fighting dragons.  Spells are fueled with purple mana gems that are mined from new mine tile types or gathered in new spaces on the expansion board.<br/>The automa decks add solo and enhanced two player experiences using dummy players. Dummy player actions are controlled using the automa decks.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The obvious, of course: throw money at the problem!<br/><br/>With the Monkey Business expansion, Spank the Monkey enters the glamorous world of champagne-filled hot tubs and gold-plated supermodels. Sure, it's still just a junkyard, but it's a blinged-out junkyard filled with the spoils of the rich and famous. And with the introduction of the green stuff comes a whole range of new, exciting possibilities. Spend to succeed in your actions, and use your wad of cash to buy yourself out of trouble. But, as always, be the first to Spank the Monkey.<br/><br/>How to Play<br/>Each player starts with one coin. During the game players will be able to earn more coins and use their coins in various ways.<br/><br/>There are essentially three ways that you can spend your coins. First of all there are cards that you have to pay for when playing them such as Insurance Policy and Sexy Monkey Outfit. Secondly, there are Junk cards and Reinforcement cards that require you to pay an upkeep each turn if you want to keep them in your tower. Finally, you can buy extra cards in addition to the ones you draw as normal. The first card you buy during a turn costs 1 coin, the second 2 coins, the third 3 coins, etc.<br/><br/>To be able to spend coins, you also have to earn coins. Luckily, some Junk cards such as the Oil Tower and the Bank Note Printing Press give you an income each turn as long as they are in your tower. You can also sell Junk cards from your hand. You may sell one Junk card each turn. A Junk card is worth its Strength in coins.<br/><br/>Monkey Business also introduces a new category of Junk cards called Luxury. In this category you can find precious junk such as Limo, Spa and Inflatable Bouncing Castle.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>    Spank the Monkey<br/><br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gigantoskop.se/games/monkeybusiness/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.gigantoskop.se/games/monkeybusiness/</a><br/><br/>",

These maps, like their locations, couldn&rsquo;t be more different. Rainforest is all about fluctuating goods prices while Sahara is a mean, unforgiving map that adds a layer of strategy to Age of Steam and Steam games that&rsquo;s heavily focused on location.<br/><br/>Amazon Rainforest takes place deep in the Brazilian forests, where you&rsquo;re building railroads between the few small cities scattered about. Unlike most Steam/AoS maps, Amazon does not have towns...and there&rsquo;s no way to get them on the map. Fortunately, your income isn&rsquo;t tied to links. Unfortunately, it&rsquo;s tied to the &ldquo;wood market&rdquo; where each color cube represents a different kind of prized and scarce South American wood. The more wood that&rsquo;s delivered, the scarcer the supply, which drives up the price. The less wood on the board, the cheaper the wood. You&rsquo;ve got to find the rare stuff and deliver it before anyone else does. Due to the limited number of cities, the track network you build is critical. Amazon Rainforest is for 3-6 players.<br/><br/>Sahara Desert takes place on the northern portion of Africa. In possibly one of the harshest climates ever to build a railroad network, you won&rsquo;t survive without lots and lots of water. However, you can only get water from the oases throughout the desert, and once they dry up, they dry up for good. If you don&rsquo;t have access to water you can pay per delivery, or if you&rsquo;re really crafty, you&rsquo;ll choose the Water Import action and not worry about water for this turn. Regardless of how you do it, it&rsquo;s going to be tough, and there&rsquo;s going to be more moisture slowing coming down your face in the form of tears than anywhere else. Sahara Desert is for 3-5 players who won&rsquo;t acknowledge their limitations.<br/><br/>The 2010 Essen Aos/Steam map pack from Bezier Games features 7 new maps, including 6 mounted ones on 3 double size expansions.

Under her sway, a new, fanatical sect of zealots has risen to power within the fractured ranks of House Baratheon.<br/><br/>Featuring the manipulative red woman Melisandre, as well as a wealth of synergy for cards with the Asshai trait, Rituals of R&rsquo;hllor will bring new deck-building depth to your A Game of Thrones experience.<br/><br/>",

Still, these great technologies are not inherently good or bad&mdash;they only reflect the morals of those who use them. And in the hands of the Galactic Empire, even the most impressive technology can become a weapon of evil.<br/><br/>Delve into the stunning technologies of Star Wars with Technological Terror, the sixth Force Pack in the Opposition cycle for Star Wars: The Card Game. Within this pack&rsquo;s five unique objective sets, you&rsquo;ll find astromechs, assassin droids, Imperial shuttles, and beat-up Skyhoppers. Like the other expansions throughout this cycle, many of these objective sets and new fate cards play into the rivalries between factions, goading the Jedi against the Sith, the Imperial Navy against the Rebel Alliance, and the Smugglers and Spies against the Scum and Villainy. No matter which side you fight for, you&rsquo;ll find the technology to support your goals in this Force Pack.<br/><br/>Contains objective sets 256-260.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the Provinces expansion, you will come into contact with other nations, which will give you the opportunity to conquer and assimilate new territories into your Civilization!<br/><br/>This expansion includes exciting new tiles to add to the board, new Mastery cards, Conquest cards, Rebellion cards, Objectives cards, and more! It is also fully compatible with all of the other Dominations expansions!<br/><br/>At the beginning of each Age, each player will draw a Province card, then take the corresponding Province tile which will be added to their hand. This tile must be placed on the board during the Age during your Growth phase, at the same time as a regular domino. Each player will hence be playing six dominoes during the Age instead of the usual five. These dominoes will have unique illustrations and characteristics : some will have resources, some will have other effects, much like the Monument tiles.<br/><br/>Once your Province tile has been placed, you can Conquer it. To do so, you&rsquo;re going to need a whole new resource : Conquest! Conquest is represented by a deck of small Conquest cards that can only be gained one way - using one of the expansion&rsquo;s new Mastery cards: Conscription. Conscription is a unique Mastery card in that it doesn&rsquo;t belong to any Domain: at has a value of 3 that can be purchased using any kind of resource. It is then used as a converter &ndash; changing any Knowledge type into Conquest cards.<br/><br/>When Conquest cards are purchased, they are drawn from the Conquest deck, which is placed face down on the table. Each card has a value of 1 to 5 Conquest Points, and as they&rsquo;re drawn randomly, you never know what you&rsquo;re going to get! Additionally, some of these cards have special powers and bonuses!<br/><br/>To conquer a Province, you must pay the corresponding number of Conquest points as stated on the tile&rsquo;s Province card. However, these Provinces won&rsquo;t allow themselves to be conquered easily. Each Province card also has a &ldquo;Rebellion&rdquo; value. This refers to the deck of Rebellion cards, which - similarly to the Conquest cards - are drawn randomly, have a value of 1 to 5, and some of them have special powers that can be good or bad. You must draw the number of Rebellion cards specified, then add their value to that Province's Conquest value to determine its full cost. If you have enough Conquest points, then you conquer the Province &ndash; placing a City token on it and gaining the bonus stated on its card. As with the classic dominos, just because you placed a Province tile, doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s yours - once placed, any player can conquer it!<br/><br/>However, although the tiles MUST be placed during the Age, you don&rsquo;t have to conquer them. Each Province has an End of Age effect, which is triggered if it has not been conquered. These effects can be good or bad &ndash; from allowing you to gain additional resources, to unleashing hordes of barbarian invaders to destroy neighbouring Cities!<br/><br/>These combinations of different effects bring a fascinating new strategic facet to Dominations. Will you conquer as many Provinces as you can to reap the benefits, or will you simply place the tiles next to your opponents&rsquo; Cities, forcing them to react to avoid negative End of Age effects?<br/><br/>Provinces brings a slightly more aggressive stance to your games of Dominations, in that your actions can potentially damage your adversaries : Provinces is the first expansion where your nation can actually lose ground : Cities can be destroyed, resources lost.<br/><br/>",

This trade route will be represented by a punchboard ring placed around your City. Each of these rings has two protruding branches, which will allow that City to be connected to two other Cities. This means each City can only be attached in two directions, creating a road-like chain! Of course, these rings will be fully illustrated to represent the trade routes they&rsquo;re creating!<br/><br/>These trade routes give players a wealth of new options:<br/><br/>When a City is connected to a trade route, its owner gains Victory Points equal to the number of other Cities that are part of that route.<br/><br/>When a City is activated, the player receiving those resources can choose to take Knowledge of the colour of that City OR of any City connected to the same trade route.<br/><br/>Cities connected to a trade route can be used as both their colour or the colour of any other City connected to the same trade route during the game when it comes to Mastery cards and other effects.<br/><br/>Trade routes can be worth big points. The further into the game you get, the more Cities there are that can be potentially connected to trade routes, the more points you can generate.<br/><br/>However, your trade route doesn&rsquo;t belong to just you - in the true spirit of commerce, anyone can connect to it and earn themselves points if they have the resources to spare!<br/><br/>Also comes with a new array of Mastery cards that will work off the Trade route mechanic in order to help generate new resources, Victory points, Influence, and more!<br/><br/>",

Block your opponents&rsquo; paths, make your path to the finish shorter, or crush your opponents!<br/><br/>Reality Shift is a fast-paced 3D racing game for 2 to 4 players set in a retro virtual reality world. The racetrack is made of cubes whose magnetic facings have different paths on them. Your light bike is not constrained by gravity. Your magnetic figure can use any accessible path on the tops and the sides of the cubes.<br/><br/>Being fast is not enough though. You will be able to play a card each turn that will move a Reality Cube, creating a track that is always shifting. Don&rsquo;t have a path to the finish? Transform the board to make one. Is an opponent in the lead? Change the track to block their way or just crush them with a Reality Cube, forcing them to respawn at the start.<br/><br/>Be faster, smarter, and more ruthless than the other racers to win.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>Deluxe Components included:<br/>- 1 White Light Bike and summary card<br/>- 21 Power Cube counters<br/>- 1 Double-sided grid board<br/>- 18 Power-up cards<br/>- 1 Vortex Cube<br/>- 1 White Hole Cube<br/>- 1 Portal Cube<br/>- 1 Deluxe Rulebook<br/><br/>The cubes can be added to a base game setup providing you with new hazards and options while the Power-up cards provide new variants to include in a race.  The grid board allows for a basic side or one with track movement layouts that can be used in conjunction with cube movement.  The White Light Bike is powerful if chosen but comes with a few built-in setbacks as well.<br/><br/>The deluxe rulebook comes with 11 new track setups for use with the deluxe set or in combination with the retail version allowing for larger tracks.  It also details all the variations and power-up card descriptions as well as rules for including a 5th player using the white Light Bike.<br/><br/>",

Living deep under the sulfurous sands, these massive insect-like creatures lay in wait for unsuspecting prey to stray too close to their hunting grounds. They are attracted to vibrations in the ground and often tunnel their way through rock and sand to reach the site of a newly crashed ship or freshly opened portal to an Otherworld in hopes of an easy meal!<br/><br/>With the ability to erupt from the ground under Heroes, casting them aside while taking a bite or two along the way, or worse yet, pulling the Hero back underground with it, the Terralisk is a fearsome foe to fight! Whether in the claustrophobic confines of the mines if they have strayed through a portal into our world, or in the burning desert sands of the Blasted Wastes, the Heroes must always be wary not to wander into a Terralisk hunting ground!<br/><br/>",

Rather than following the plot of A Song of Ice and Fire, this cycle is centered around the capital of the seven kingdoms, allowing you to explore the world of Westeros more freely than ever before. Every Chapter Pack in this cycle features three copies each of twenty unique cards to strengthen your decks and help you embrace the deadly intrigues of A Song of Ice and Fire with the continued cultivation of the shadow keyword, first reintroduced in the Dance of Shadows cycle.<br/><br/>Your journey to the capital of the seven kingdoms brings you to the throne room as you stand in the shadow of the Iron Throne itself. Focusing on themes of legacy and honor, this Chapter Pack includes a new agenda centered around attachments and new versions of favorite characters seeking to leave the past behind. The shadows have fallen on Westeros&mdash; do you have the determination to survive the long night and lead the realm to a new dawn?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Iganie 1831 covers the battle of Iganie, one of the most brilliant victories of Poles over Russians during the November Uprising. It was fought between the Polish army commanded by General Ignacy Prądzyński and the Russian 6th Corps commanded by General Grigory Rosen. The battle was the final part of the Polish Spring Offensive. The goal of the operation was Russian army&rsquo;s main depot in Siedlce, which supplied all Russian forces fighting in the Kingdom of Poland. After two first successful for Poles battles at Wawer and Dębe Wielkie (both on March 31st 1831) the pursuit for the defeated Russians was stopped. It allowed them to control chaos which appeared during the retreat, reorganize their units and bring reinforcements.<br/><br/>The battle of Iganie was the last try to broke Russian 6th Corps near Siedlce and capture the Russian main depot. Planned by General Prądzyński attack of three groups approaching from three different directions failed becaue of the lack of operational coordination and poor command of General Jan Skrzynecki. Two groups which had to cooperate with Prądzyński&rsquo;s maneuver group did not appear during the battle and has come to the battlefield in the late evening or the next day. This caused that Prądzyński&rsquo;s forces had to fight outnumbered by Russians. Russian forces also were divided into parts. General Rosen was bound by the orders from Field Marshal Ivan Diebitsch which urged him first of all to defend Siedlce and keep defensive position on the eastern bank of the Muchawiec river. That gave Prądzyński chance to beat the enemy situated on the western bank of the Muchawiec river before Russians combine all their units and destroy his group. The decisive moment of the battle was when Russians started to move battalions from the eastern bank of the Muchawiec river to its western bank where the battle was taking place. Prądzyński decided to seize the only bridge on the river. During terrific bayonet fight Polish 5th Line Infantry Regiment completely broke the elite Russian Jaeger Brigade (13th &amp; 14th Jaeger Regiments), called Warna Lions (because of their fame gained in the recently finished war with Turkey), and captured the bridge. This cut off Russian units on the western bank of the river from the rest of their comrades. Finally Poles won the battle. The Russian losses are estimated between 3 600 &ndash; 4 500 soldiers, while Polish one numbered 400 &ndash; 500 soldiers. Tactical success of Poles was undoubted, however they did not decide to attack through the swampy river Muchawiec also because of the informations that the main Russian army is near and would join the Rosen&rsquo;s forces the next day.<br/><br/>The game is an expansion for Ostrołęka 26 maja 1831. It means that Iganie 1831 uses system rules (also charts &amp; tables) and markers which are in Ostrołęka 26 maja 1831. There are two scenarios in the game: the historical and the alternative one. The first one in more detailed way simulates the battle and all background of it, especially specific events and operational situation of both sides. The alternative scenario is more flexible, giving the players more possibilities to create their own strategy and modify the course of the battle. However this scenario also stays in historical frames. Although the game bases on Ostrołęka 26 maja 1831 system rules, there are few new rules for this battle only. The most important are command points and changeable phase order. In the rule &amp; scenario book you will find also a detailed historical article on the battle and some additional system rules for Ostrołęka 26 maja 1831 (especially an integrated table of artillery fire with round-shot and granades). The playing time varies from 2,5 to 4 hours, however there is an autowin option which can end the game faster.<br/><br/>Components (all packed in ziplock):<br/>- One mapsheet 42 x 30 cm <br/>- 108 die-cut counters<br/>- One rulebook and scenariobook (both in one book)<br/>- One sheet with information on Russian artillery modifiers<br/>- Two sheets whit unit rosters (for Poles and Russians)<br/>- One sheet with turn track and command points tracks<br/>- One sheet with mapsheet legenda<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Maternity &amp; Dental Clinics is a new mini expansion for Rush M.D. that introduces two new modules which expand the game's Outpatient clinic.<br/><br/>In Maternity Clinic, you need to examine pregnant women to determine the gender of their baby(ies). In some cases the mother will have to be admitted in a Ward right away and have a surgery to give birth right away.<br/><br/>In order to identify each baby's gender or to determine if the pregnant ladies need to go into labor, you will need to perform an Ultrasound, in the same fashion that you perform this in the Ultrasound section of the new Examinations Board, by using the special see-through red plastic chip to locate one or more gender symbols on the back of the top Maternity Diagnosis card. For each symbol you locate, you must place the corresponding tile(s) on the mother's card. If instead of finding gender symbols during the ultrasound, you locate a scalpel symbol, this means that the mother-to-be needs to give birth immediately to ensure the health of her baby. You will need to Hospitalize the mother to a Ward bed and take her to an Operating Room soon! In the Operating Room you will need to bring a Doctor and a Nurse to deliver the baby!<br/><br/>In the Dental Clinic, you will get to admit Patients from the Outpatient Clinic who need to have their teeth checked up and cleaned. In order to perform a teeth cleanup, you will take the cubes and throw them like dice close by to the Dental Clinic board. Each cube(tooth) has one side that is colored black. Using your tweezers, you will need to place each tooth on the available slots of the Mouth tile but making sure that the black side of each tooth is facing down.<br/><br/>",

This organization, composed mainly of Argosseans, maintains a notorious rivalry with the Zingaran Freebooters, and their bloody feuds have turned the tides a deeper shade of crimson.<br/><br/>These are tales of high seas and high adventure. These are the tales of the Red Brotherhood.<br/><br/>Fred Henry is returning to the design table and cooking up four new Adventure Mode scenarios. These exciting adventures make use of the brand new double-sided pirate ship game boards and only require the core/retail version of Conan AND the all-new contents featured in the Conan the Conqueror expansion.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

So, in her spare time, Eva danced, drew, sculpted and even took Japanese fencing lessons. Like everyone else, the zombie invasion changed Eva&rsquo;s life: acting normal is now a nonsense and she feels more alive than ever. Extroverted and hyperactive, Eva is a messenger between survivors groups. No way she&rsquo;s going to give up on her old activities: her notebook is full of sketches and that sword sure comes in handy.<br/><br/>Eva is a promotional Survivor that was available to those that pledged extra during the Kickstarter campaign.  She may be available in limited quantities at upcoming conventions.  A zombie version (Zombivor) will be available to backers in 2013.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "With Reinforcements players are getting three new modules that alter Orcs Orcs Orcs in interesting ways.<br/><br/>MODULE 1: Reinforcements<br/><br/>Three reptile creatures are joining battle with the orcs. At the start of the game choose with which you want to play and just switch them with one of the corresponding creatures of the basic game.<br/><br/><br/>     Flying Croc: The tough one among the so called &ldquo;weak&rdquo; Creatures. With his three life points he makes it a hell of a lot harder for the mages to get things going in terms of special abilities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Spawning Toad: Once this big blob is defeated he drops a Toadling token on the sector where he was located. The toadling has one life point and when defeated gives the mage a one-time use special ability such as take one extra action, draw a card or gain a mana of his choice.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Bomber: Defeating him on your first action gives you a huge opportunity to get even more things done on your turn since he will inflict one damage to all creatures on the same patch.<br/><br/><br/>MODULE 2: Terrains<br/><br/>There are three terrain types coming with this module which will have different effects once a creature steps onto them. At the start of the game mix the terrain patches and put them randomly across the battlefield.<br/><br/><br/>     Streets: Creatures who step onto a street will immediately advance one patch closer to the tower, so be careful.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Stone field: Creatures on the stone field have cover and thus have an extra life point.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Mandrel vines: Creatures are getting hurt in those vines thus having minus one life point.<br/><br/><br/>MODULE 3: New Fate cards<br/><br/>With the addition of the new fate cards things become increasingly more difficult for the mages to deal with the charging orc hordes. The most important rule change is that mages can now only attack creatures in the front lines, meaning the first creatures they see on their lane. So better secure the best spots on the tower. The new fate cards change the way creatures are moving towards the tower. They now move in packs and on specific lanes, rather than a whole category.<br/><br/>",

While colourful biplanes gallantly duel each other as true &quot;knights of the air,&quot; colossal &ldquo;giants of the sky&rdquo; also take flight, bringing destruction to distant cities and over the battlefield.<br/><br/>Wings of Glory is probably the most popular World War One aerial combat tabletop game in the world, with a great collection of pre-painted, ready-to-play model airplanes. Thanks to its elegant and innovative game system, it is possible to start playing minutes after opening the rules. Each airplane has a unique, historically accurate, maneuver deck, yet it is easy to play.<br/><br/>The British Handley Page O/400 was a colossal Entente bomber used to support ground troops on the Western Front and fly bombing raids deep into the enemy territory.<br/><br/>This leviathan of the air was used in the last months of the war in pivotal historical events, such as the strategic bombing of industrial complexes in Germany.<br/><br/>The wingspan of the O/400 scale model is 21 cm (more than 8&quot;). The model will be a complete, ready to play miniature in 1/144 scale, painted and assembled.<br/><br/>The model also includes everything you need to include it in your Wings of Glory aerial battles - maneuver deck, airplane card, crew management card and damage counters, new rules, and the special gaming base.<br/><br/>",

They will fly into the thick of battle to save their allies without hesitation and perform feats that would break even the most experienced fighters. Goultard is considered one of the strongest Iops in history. In a twist of fate, he was possessed by an extremely powerful demon, resulting him becoming an avatar of chaos and destruction.<br/><br/>Just like his normal form, Goultard the Barbarian is a close range fighter who uses his health to fuel his devastating attacks. As he continues to attack with no regard for his health, he gains additional range on his attacks. And thanks to his godlike strength, he can execute clusters of low power enemies with little effort, allowing him to quickly level teams that chooses to fight with numbers.<br/><br/>",

But this deep bond has a downside. When a Familiar dies, its owner suffers a terrible mental shock, which hampers their skills for a time.<br/><br/>This expansion can be used with any Sword &amp; Sorcery Quest or Campaign (Immortal Souls or Ancient Chronicles), by simply shuffling the Familiar cards into the Treasure deck.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>Following on the heels of the first Squadron Pack for the Down in Flames series of WWII air combat card games comes Squadron Pack 2: Bombers. While the first pack contained new fighters, this one adds more Light Bombers and Formation aircraft to the  system.<br/><br/>The pack will include such famous aircraft as the B-25H (complete with 75mm gun) and the Il-2m3 Shturmovik. But there will be lesser-known planes as well, like the German Hs-129B-1/R2 (a sort of WWII version of today's A-10) and the Italian CANT Z.501 Gabbiano flying boat. All the cards will be printed in the eight-per-sheet (cut 'em out yourself) style of C3i-DiF module inserts that you've enjoyed over the years.<br/><br/>One of the difficulties in creating a pack of bombers and patrol planes is that up until now these aircraft types have only been used in the context of a Down in Flames campaign. The rules included in the pack provide three ways around this problem. First, there are guidelines for adding Formation aircraft to basic game dogfights. Second, the pack includes a number of stand-alone generic missions into which players can simply &quot;plug in&quot; appropriate aircraft. Finally, we have included rules (courtesy of Roger Horky) that allow Formation aircraft to engage in a form of dogfighting (called Gunnery Duels in the game) with other Formation planes. So if you've ever wanted to fly a Short Stirling against an FW-200 Condor, now is your chance.<br/><br/>Squadron Pack 2's rules also contain reprints of some of the rules from Corsairs and Hellcats for the benefit of those players who don't own that game (you know who you are). In addition, there are rules for two new ground attack weapons: the German Hs 293 radio-controlled air to surface missile and Fritz X radio-controlled glide bomb.<br/><br/>Like the first pack, Squadron Pack 2: Bombers will contain 64 new aircraft cards printed 8 to a sheet in the same enhanced graphic style as Squadron Pack 1. The pack will also include a short (4-8 page) rulebook and an 11x17 wrap around cover decorated with Rodger MacGowan's gorgeous artwork. The inside of the cover sheet will form a play mat for use during Gunnery Duels.<br/><br/>Developers: Mike Lemick and Rodger B. MacGowan<br/><br/>",

Featuring deadlier enemies, darker locations, and more terrifying surprises, each Nightmare Deck introduces new, alternate encounter cards and instructions for using them to reshape a scenario's encounter deck. The result? A nightmarish journey through territory players thought they knew, but with new twists and turns that will have them on the edges of their seats!<br/><br/>Each Nightmare Deck comes with twenty new encounter cards to add to the matching original quest, as well as a Nightmare Mode card that explains which older cards are removed from the original set-up and a card providing additional game rules.<br/><br/>Nightmare Decks first appeared in FFG's &quot;Game Night Kits&quot;, which are available to retail outlets, and were later released as print-on-demand items.<br/><br/>",

Many ideas came from BoardGameGeek users, many others were devised by Steve Jackson, and all were finalized by Steve.<br/><br/>The result is a scenario designer's dream come true, as there is terrain in this set (the log-filled water, for instance) that is not in the rules but is left for the scenario designer.  There are also many things that aren't standard Ogre canon.  Various pieces are intended to work together.  Here are some ideas that Steve Jackson suggests, for example:<br/><br/><br/>        - Dams, broken dams, downstream log-jams, and flooded towns are all designed to support destroy-the-dam scenarios.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - BGGsaurus from the 3-D sheet, and the terrain he has stomped through. Is it merely damaged, or has he left it radioactive or worse? And does he have some connection with the flying saucer?<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - The big comm tower can just be a target, or it can be related to the flying saucer. Does it call the saucer? Does the saucer BUILD it? Maybe it's not actually a comm tower - those dishes could be super lasers!<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - For that matter, is the giant glowing crater an exploded reactor, or is it what happens when the flying saucer takes too much damage?<br/><br/><br/>Sheet 1 contains (front/back):<br/><br/><br/>        - Giant flying saucer / Giant CRASHED flying saucer<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - Missile base (center control building, nine launch silos) / Shot-up missile base<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - Flooded city (white buildings in blue water) / City devastated by BGGsaurus (footprints)<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - Repair facility (road going through buildings, robot arms, and so on) / Wrecked version of repair facility<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - Swamp shape with multiple streams (this would drastically slow anything but infantry) / Flopped on reverse<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - Town hex completely surrounded by forest / Humongous crater<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - Bank of radar dishes / Shot-up radars.<br/><br/><br/>Sheet 2 contains (front/back):<br/><br/><br/>        - Two dams, one with a road over it and one not / Each has a broken version on the other side<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - Airfield with road passing near / Shot-up airfield<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - Coastal shape with forest / Coastal shape with burning rubble.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - Drowned city / Stomped city<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - Three different-shaped overlays of flooded terrain choked with debris and logs (to use downstream from a broken dam) / Clear terrain with BGGsaurus footprints<br/><br/><br/><br/>        - Humongous crater, but old and with plants regrowing on the inside / Humongous crater, full of water. The terrain inside the crater is NOT defined in the regular rules - it looks like shallow water filled with junk, but make of it what you will. Steve says he would not swim in it.<br/><br/><br/>Both sheets also have some &quot;dogleg&quot; shapes for changing streams and ridges.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Future of Warfare!<br/><br/>The year is 3026 and war has ravaged the thousands of worlds of the Inner Sphere for centuries. Successor Lords send clashing armies to conquer their neighbors and re-establish the long-lost Star League. Though the BattleMech is the king of the battlefield, it is supported by a much vaster array of conventional vehicles that fight everywhere from premier border worlds to the back waters of beyond. When in the hands of an experienced field commander, even a BattleMech must be leery when facing a company of tanks.<br/><br/>This revised edition of the original Technical Readout: 3026 features the most common military vehicles of the Succession Wars. Additionally, this volume contains nineteen vehicles, aerospace fighters, DropShips, and JumpShips mentioned in the fictional context of the BattleTech universe but never before presented in a technical readout.<br/><br/>For use with Classic BattleTech.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Carcassonne is a tile-placement game in which the players draw and place a tile with a piece of southern French landscape on it. The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>This 2003 special edition comes in a metal box and contains the Carcassonne base game and the 2nd expansion Carcassonne: Expansion 2 – Traders & Builders.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Fool's Journey is a solitaire card game designed for use with a standard 78-card Tarot deck. In this game the Fool embarks upon a journey in which he acquires wisdom, takes chances, and overcomes numerous challenges with the aid of mysterious helpers.<br/><br/>The Fool is removed from the deck and placed in the gameplay setup to represent the character. The remaining cards serve as challenges (Trumps), wisdom (coins), strength (batons), volition (swords), vitality (cups), chance (aces), and helpers (royals). An adventure is created by laying out cards in groups of four. Progress is made through the journey by playing three of the four adventure cards. The fourth card serves as the foundation for a new adventure.<br/><br/>Volition cards may be equipped to engage individual challenges, depleting them of their power. Strength may be equipped to endure multiple challenges with any excess power from a challenge depleting the Fool's vitality. Vitality cards are used to replenish this value. Wisdom cards are used to deploy Helpers that double the value of a Vitality, Strength, or Volition card. Chance cards may be used to reshuffle all adventure cards back into the deck and begin a new adventure.<br/><br/>The game ends when the Fool's vitality reaches zero or he overcomes all challenges and successfully completes the journey.<br/><br/>This game was inspired by thematic solitaire playing card games, especially Scoundrel, Donsol, and Card Crawl as well as the Monomyth described by author Joseph Campbell. It was originally created for the 2016 Solitaire Print and Play Contest.<br/><br/>",

Yet some work better than others. Recommendations are provided in the rules.<br/><br/>1. STRONG-ARM TACTICS MODULE<br/><br/>Consists of: Counter-Terrorism Project * Black Operations. XXI Century mini-expansion - 7 cards * 3 Treaty cards<br/><br/>The World: The Counter-Terrorism Project exploits the people&rsquo;s fear of terrorism in order to concentrate absolute power in the hands of counter-terrorism organizations.<br/><br/>Black Operations: it might seem they have no other purpose than chaos and destruction. In fact, they change the rules. The winner will earn the ruins of the world, but it will be their ruins.<br/><br/>Gameplay: You discard cards to Advance in Counter-Terrorism. As a benefit, you may use Agents from your Recruitment Pool when Infiltrating an Objective or Carrying out a Covert Operation. Additionally, you eliminate your opponent's Agents while Advancing in the Project.<br/><br/>Black Operations are another type of Covert Operations. They require less Agents, but you discard your cards to conduct them. You Carry out Black Operations in order - Cyber Threat first, then Eco Terrorism, and finally Blackout.<br/><br/>2. FOURTH ESTATE MODULE<br/><br/>Consists of: Global Media Project * Trends mini-expansion - 6 cards * 3 Treaty cards<br/><br/>The World: The Global Media Project uses the media to lead the average person to the appropriate points of a view.<br/><br/>Social-political currents (Trends) usually originate in a highly influential country, and then like wind spread around the world. Trends should be anticipated and plans adjusted &mdash; done neither earlier nor later than necessary.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The Global Media Project requires you to sacrifice Treaties you have already made. But with this high cost, comes big benefits. Each time you advance in Global Media, you capture an Objective card. AND at the end of the game one of your Supreme Power cards generates MUCH more Influence for select Objective cards you have made.<br/><br/>Each Trend provides useful advantages for the duration of a game round and may be captured for Influence.<br/><br/>3. REPTILOIDS MODULE<br/><br/>Consists of: Reptiloid Project * 15 Reptiloid Objective cards * 3 Treaty cards * 3 Contactee cards (Men of Action) * 1 UFO Hysteria card (Trend).<br/><br/>The World: With the Reptiloids Module, Deep State takes a step into a fictional aspect of conspiracy theories. The ambitions of the &lsquo;Committee&rsquo; on becoming a secret world government have become meaningless since the lizard-like aliens from the planet Nibiru are closer than ever to seizing power on Earth.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Reptiloids Project effectively replaces the Deep State Project. Players compete for Reptiloid Objective cards that allow them to make new Treaties while ignoring their conditions, and they Advance in Reptiloids Project in order to obtain new Treaties and gather Influence at the end &mdash; but only if they have enough Special Interest emblems on their cards!<br/><br/>4. SUPERIORITY DOCTRINE MODULE<br/><br/>Consists of: Nuclear Power, Worldwide Bank, and World, Inc. Projects<br/><br/>Gameplay: Each of these Projects replaces one of the base game Projects. Nuclear Power provides you with Ghost Agents for each World War card played. Worldwide Bank extends your ability to reach distant cards further down the Infiltration Zone. World, Inc. returns your Agents back from missions and generates Influence for every Project you participate in.<br/><br/>PLAYERS<br/><br/>All Modules are suitable for 1 to 5 players. Detailed solo play rules are provided in the rules for each of the Modules.<br/><br/>",

These equipments not only give you victory points but also help your mission: Sails shorten your journey time and help to flee rivals, cannons help to fight them, sailors help in melee combat and larger trunks help to enlarge your profits.<br/>And if you are too much playing for your own profit all the players loose if the rival pirates occupy at least 5 ports!<br/><br/>The game offers much more, and all is controlled via the YVIO console in the middle of the game board, which interacts with the ships and their &quot;YVIES&quot; and the electronic devices embedded in the game board and - last but not least - with the boardgame players.<br/><br/>And there is still enough boardgame feeling with the game board, the ship pawns you move, a cardboard ship mat with cardboard equipment and cardboard dubloons.<br/><br/>You don't have to learn rules, as the console steers you via an introductionary game through the shallows of the beginner in multilingual speech if so desired.<br/><br/>",

Survivors of these conquests hate the Janusians almost more than Terrans do &ndash; which is why it came as no shock when a pair of aliens arrived planetside and offered their help to Project: ELITE. Two esteemed members of the elite within the Plu&rsquo;htonian royalty, Royal Envoy Apollo and Duchess Aloria, have come to Earth to help deal defeat to the Janusians &ndash; just as their people did decades ago. It might come at a price down the road, but for now, any help is good help in such a dark hour. The ELITEs need all the help they can get defending humanity, even if it comes from beyond the stars.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This expansion was released in connection with Mayday Games' Kickstarter campaign for their reprint of Get Bit! in 2011.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>Shark Hand Containing:<br/><br/>    Right Leg<br/>    Left Leg<br/>    Right Arm<br/>    Left Arm<br/>    Head (no ties)<br/>    Any Limb (must be tied)<br/><br/><br/><br/>    6 Hunger Tokens<br/><br/><br/>SETUP<br/><br/>Choose one player to play the Shark, and give him the Shark hand. (This increases the number of players needed by 1, making the game a 5-7 player game.) The shark player receives 1 hunger token for each swimmer in the game.<br/><br/>The base game is setup as normal, including the shark not appearing on the first round.<br/><br/>PLAY<br/><br/>Game play is the same, except that the shark player also puts down a card from his hand when all the swimmers do, and is revealed at the same time.<br/><br/>After all the swimmers have moved, the shark bites whomever is in the back of the line, and removes the limb corresponding to the card played. They play out as follows:<br/><br/><br/>    Right Leg, Left Leg, Right Arm, or Left Arm: If the swimmer has that limb, the limb is removed, that swimmer jumps to the front and picks up all of his cards. If the swimmer does not have that limb, it is counted as a Miss - see below.<br/>    Head: If there were no tied cards played by swimmers this round, the swimmer in the back is removed from the game immediately. Otherwise, it is a Miss.<br/>    Any Limb: If any of the cards played by swimmers this round are ties, the swimmer in the back loses a limb of the swimmer's player's choice, jumps to the front, and picks up all of his cards. If there are no tied cards, it is a Miss.<br/><br/><br/>Like a swimmer, if the shark is ever down to just one card in his hand, he picks up all his cards.<br/><br/>MISS<br/><br/>On a miss, the shark loses one hunger token, and picks up the cards he has played. The swimmer in the back does not lose a limb, move, or pick up his cards.<br/><br/>GAME END<br/><br/>If the shark loses his last hunger token, the game ends. The swimmer with the most limbs wins, and if there's a tie, the swimmer with the most limbs closest to the front wins.<br/><br/>If the game ever comes down to just the swimmer and the shark, the game ends, and the shark wins.<br/><br/>",

The launching of geosynchronous platforms called Chariots, which orbit Europa and influence the development of the colonies below.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, an elite group of women and men, forged under Europa's harsh conditions, have emerged to assume greater leadership roles. These Commanders have assumed a prestigious rank with great power and authority over the growing colonies.<br/><br/>With one harsh development cycle under your belt, you look to expand your colony and compete again to establish the most successful outpost on the resource-rich Europa. The Artemis Project continues...<br/><br/>The Artemis Project: Satellites &amp; Commanders is an expansion that adds two new major opportunities for strategic play to the base game. Satellites are off-board locations which players can access and influence the action on the moon&rsquo;s surface below in subtle yet powerful ways. Commanders are a new category of colonist that can act as any colonist type, lend their power to dice you send to various locations, and assist in end game scoring.<br/><br/>",

While the interstate can allow for quick goods transportation, it also becomes increasingly clogged as the game progresses and eventually becomes nearly impassable.<br/><br/>The Berlin Wall, meanwhile, takes Age of Steam back to the era of the Cold War and the divided city of Berlin. Troop garrisons impede goods movement for much of the game, and the wall also presents an imposing obstacle. Of course, the fall of the wall in 1989 changes everything.<br/><br/>The Berlin Wall map was reprinted in 2011 as part of Age of Steam Expansion: Moon and Berlin Wall.<br/><br/>",

During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player&rsquo;s existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.<br/><br/>By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.<br/><br/>Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards, special actions, and terrain sectors to build the map! Kingdom Builder: Big Box ramps up this variability by including all expansions to date, ensuring you'll never play the same game twice!<br/><br/>All in one box, the Family Box includes the base game, the Nomads expansion, materials for a 5th player and 2 Queenies (The Caves &amp; The Capitol).<br/><br/>",

Among them are a number of &quot;norse god&quot; cards that feature the new &quot;passive&quot; keyword and add their own unique rules and twists to the battlefield whenever they're in play.<br/><br/>In Crimson Company, two opposing players take on the roles of adventurous noblemen in a cut-throat fantasy world. In a battle of wits, they assemble armies of sellswords, from hardened warriors and shady merchants to mythical creatures as old as time.<br/><br/>Your goal in a match of Crimson Company is to conquer two of the three castles in the center. You conquer a castle by amassing more strength than your opponent in the castle's lane by the time that lane is scored. A lane is scored once a player owns at least four cards in it.<br/><br/>Cards represent a large variety of characters, all of which have specific strength values and unique effects. The latter are either one-time instant effects that happen when a card is played, or they are triggered in specific phases of the game. Four randomly drawn cards from the character deck are &quot;on offer&quot;. You may bid coins on only one of those at a time. Then your opponent decides to either pay you off, doubling the coins you bid, or pass and let you play the card.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

These military geniuses support their battle plans with the steady, inexorable beat of skeletal drummers and the sinister sigils raised by the gaunt standard-bearers. And perhaps worst of all, necromancers stalk the ranks of Waiqar&rsquo;s army, raising the fallen to fight again in the name of their lord.<br/><br/>In the same fashion as the Daqan Infantry Command Unit Upgrade Expansion, this expansion pack offers four new figures that you may add to an infantry unit: a Standard-Bearer, a Champion, a Drummer, and a Necromancer. With eighteen new upgrade cards to increase your army&rsquo;s power, you&rsquo;ll find plenty of ways to add these figures to your units, perhaps adding a Marching Drummer who lets your unit turn freely, so long as the Drummer remains with the unit.<br/><br/>",

P. Lovecraft<br/><br/>Bubastis is probably the weirdest faction of them all. It doesn&rsquo;t have any cultists. It doesn&rsquo;t have a Great Old One. It does have Bastet, an Elder God (not quite the same). Like other factions it has 6 spellbooks that are gained in the normal way (though of course with her own unique requirements). One of her most unusual features is that it has a separate map tile representing the Moon. This Moon is the Bubastis starting area. It counts as a Bubastis-controlled gate for all purposes, except that it can&rsquo;t be seized by another faction. No other gate can be built or moved there (except Yog-Sothoth via the Catnapping spellbook). Bubastis units can move and be pained freely between the Moon and any other map area. Other factions can move or be pained from the Moon to the main map area, but they can&rsquo;t move to the Moon on their own. Since your cats can&rsquo;t build or occupy gates, the Moon is their only gate throughout the game.<br/><br/>If they don&rsquo;t have Cultists, then &hellip; ?<br/><br/>Yes I know, this leads into a lot of questions. Let&rsquo;s break it down. Your faction has 6 Earth cats, 2 Cats from Mars, 2 Cats from Saturn, 2 Cats from Uranus, and Bastet. All the cats count as monsters (yes even the Earth cats), and all the cats generate 1 Power during the Gather Power phase. At game start, you have 6 Earth cats on the Moon, plus the Moon counts as your Gate. This gives you a total of 8 Power: 1 per cat and 2 for the Moon. To get more Power, you&rsquo;ll have to use a certain spellbook, fulfill a certain spellbook requirement, or summon more cats.<br/><br/>Your Earth cats have the special ability that spellbooks and abilities that target cultists can target Earth cats as if they were acolytes. The Earth cats still cannot be captured, though (except by Tsathoggua using Capture Monster). This does mean that Zingaya will turn them into undead, Ghroth kidnaps them, if you summon a Satyr it brings a pet cat, etc. You can even turn Earth cats into Brain Cylinders.<br/><br/>The Earth Cats are Combat 0, Cost 1. <br/>Cats from Mars are Combat 1, Cost 2. <br/>Cats from Saturn are Combat 2, Cost 3<br/>Cats from Uranus are Combat 3, Cost 4.<br/><br/>Each cat gets a special spellbook benefiting it in some way. The Earth cat&rsquo;s spellbook, Catabolism, lets an Earth cat recruit a monster without a gate, letting you bring them forth on the main map. The Cats from Mars spellbook, Zagazig, reverses the results of Kills and Pains, so all rolled Kills become Pains, and all rolled Pains become Kills. This works on both sides in the battle, so beware. The Cats from Saturn have a spellbook letting them spend 1 Power pre-battle to increase their attack up to 6. And the Cats from Uranus spellbook means that you can kill one extra unit anywhere on the map post-battle.<br/><br/>How can they win, without Gates?<br/><br/>Well, one of their spellbooks, Ailurophobia, lets them score 1 Doom per cat variety that they have on the main map. So if they have all four (which is usually the case), they get 5 Doom per Doom phase: 4 for the cats, and 1 for their impregnable Moon Gate. That&rsquo;s not bad. On the other hand, their Rituals of Annihilation are sucktastic, since all that does is double their Gate points, a mere +1.<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s Bastet like?<br/><br/>She&rsquo;s an Elder God (like Nodens), not a Great Old One. This means she does not roll combat dice, and she does not inherently provide an Elder Sign when you Ritual.<br/><br/>However, her Combat ability is still potent: she adds 1 Kill to your combat total, and additionally the enemy must lower their rolled Kill total by 1.<br/><br/>Her Requires Attention ability kicks in during the Doom phase. If Bastet is in an area with an enemy cultist (only), you can perform a Ritual of Annihilation. In this case, the Ritual adds exactly 4 Doom, plus if the area Bastet is in has an enemy Gate, gain 1 Elder Sign, and if the Area has an Enemy Great Old One, 2 more Elder Signs. These are additive.<br/><br/>This means your best-case scenario is you have all four cat types on the map, plus Bastet in an area with an enemy-controlled Gate and their Great Old One. In the Doom phase you will earn 5 Doom for your 4 cats &amp; Moon gate. Then the ritual scores you 4 more Doom and Bastet scores 3 Elder Signs. That&rsquo;s 9 Doom and 3 Elder Signs. Of course you won&rsquo;t be able to pull that off every turn.<br/><br/>The cats are fun, if weird, and I think you&rsquo;ll like playing with them. We have had a lot of fun. They are an extremely aggressive faction. They don&rsquo;t play &ldquo;defense&rdquo; because they want to always be in your areas causing trouble. Like kittens I guess. And Bubastis is hard to KO, because you can&rsquo;t steal her gate. You have to just kill the kitties one by one.<br/><br/>Giant Blind Albino Penguins!<br/><br/>This white, waddling thing was fully six feet high&hellip; To say that the white thing did not profoundly frighten us would be vain. We were indeed clutched for an instant by a primitive dread almost sharper than the worst of our reasoned fears regarding those others. Then came a flash of anticlimax as the white shape sidled into a lateral archway to our left to join two others of its kind which had summoned it in raucous tones. For it was only a penguin&mdash;albeit of a huge, unknown species larger than the greatest of the known king penguins, and monstrous in its combined albinism and virtual eyelessness.<br/><br/>- H. P. Lovecraft<br/><br/>The Giant Blind Albino Penguin has been a thorn in my side for years. People are constantly asking for one, yet it&rsquo;s obviously idiotic. Yes, it&rsquo;s a Lovecraft creation, but it&rsquo;s specifically non-threatening. That said, so many folks have asked for this critter that I have finally caved in. Here it is.<br/><br/>And it&rsquo;s a doozy. As with the cats, I couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to make them look goofy. They are creepy and terrifying. At least in my opinion.<br/><br/>What do they do?<br/>Their sole purpose is to mess with the other players and make them hate you. Which really ought to be the obvious desire of anyone spending Doom to get giant penguins! As with other neutral monsters you pay 2 Doom in the Doom phase, then get a free Penguin at your gate. The Penguins are cost 1, Combat minus 2. This means if you have a Penguin in the battle it reduces your attack by 2, so it&rsquo;s kind of like the irksome Servitors of the Outer Gods. But it is indeed tactically and strategically quite different.<br/><br/>The Penguins&rsquo; special ability is Laughingstock, and is pre-Battle. You can move one or more Penguins to a Battle area even if you are not involved in the Battle. If you are part of the Battle, the Penguin fights on your side&ndash;so in this case it acts kind of like a Hunting Horror with Search &amp; Destroy, except that it weakens your combat. But it does serve as a meat shield, which provides some usefulness. I have seen a Crawling Chaos fly in a pair of Penguins to accompany Nyarlathotep in a battle&ndash;sure it lowered Nyarlathotep&rsquo;s attack from 12 to 8, but 8 dice was enough for his purposes, and having two Cost 1 penguins there to take hits for him was priceless.<br/><br/>Their real threat though is if you are not involved in the battle, then you choose which side the Penguin is on, and it belongs to that player till the battle ends. In other words, they roll 2 fewer dice, and you are the reason. If they complain, tell them that your regime is &ldquo;harsh, but fair.&rdquo; Or try to convince them that you were &ldquo;helping&rdquo; by giving them an ally. The latter has never worked for me though.<br/><br/>",

Each Boss is different and you always play against one at a time.<br/><br/>While fighting against boss player take 3 cards from its deck and create its action deck. Each card has 2 actions, top and bottom. When cards are lying on table, bottoms of higher cards cover tops of lower cards, so initially boss uses only 4 actions. When you wound boss enough times it does not dies, you simply remove its action card revealing previously hidden action. Then you have to wound new card until moving to next. Boss dies only when you remove its final card.<br/><br/>Boss actions are very unique and full of flavor to each Boss. Each action also has different targeting system, it can target weakest models, closest, all base to base, etc.<br/><br/>Each boss also has its own set of tokens like Quarry, Control, Shields, Toxic that gives it the additional twist to its mechanics and combat characteristics.<br/><br/>Additionally, each boss has 2 mini scenarios.<br/><br/>Every single Boss brings tons of fun and challenge to encounters and will require many attempts to beat them!<br/><br/>Also, each Boss now will belong as fully playable Boss for its respective faction. Players will be able to field them in battles against other players and you can expect full asymmetry and unique flavor for every single boss just like in A.I mode.<br/><br/>",

Festung Europa covered the exact same period and (essentially) the same forces.  Accordingly, there is a significant amount of overlap between the two books.  There are, however, notable changes; some point values have been adjusted and some units and special rules have been added, for example.<br/><br/>Released on November 15, 2008, Fortress Europe is a softcover book containing 160 full-color pages.

This battle was the making of many warriors, and you may elevate your own knights to the rank of Kingsguard if you deem them worthy. As shadows continue to creep in from the North, the Reach, and the streets of King's Landing itself, you may find that need more protection than ever if your House is to earn victory and claim the Iron Throne!<br/><br/>-description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

There are only three Triumvirate Eggs in the deck and if you collect one by itself it will explode... but get another one and they stabilize and become Good Eggs!<br/><br/>The Brood Eggs Eggspansion: The Brood Eggs are a larger set of Eggs that can be mixed into the Egg Deck. One by itself isn't worth much, but the more of them you collect, the more they are worth!<br/><br/>Eggs and Empires is a fast-playing card game from Matt Riddle and Ben Pinchback, the designers of the hit game Fleet! Outwit your opponents to collect as many Dragon Eggs as possible! Players use matching decks of Empire Cards that contain Adventurers numbered 1-10. On each turn, all players will select one card from their hand and play it simultaneously in an attempt to collect Good Eggs that are worth VP while avoiding the nasty Exploding Eggs that lose VP!<br/><br/>Typically, the player who played the highest Adventurer chooses an Egg first, then the player with the second highest Adventurer picks an Egg, and so on until all revealed Eggs are collected. Ah, but it's not that simple! Each Adventurer has a unique power that can affect the order in which Eggs are selected. The powers interact in strategic and awesome ways so that every hand is exciting and different. Just make sure to stay away from those wicked exploding eggs!<br/><br/>The expansion was available through Kickstarter and on the Eagle &amp; Gryphon Games website.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The majority of this Supplement deals with Next War: Insurgency. These rules will allow players to conduct an insurgency against the player occupying their country using new rules. Alternatively, they will allow an occupier to attempt to crush the insurgency in the country they've supposedly just defeated. A new Sequence of Play is provided which simplifies overall game play. Elements of both the Standard and Advanced Rules are used. For instance, air power is handled with a version of the Standard Game Air Points. The COIN player will get to have his HQs and SOF, but he'll also have to maintain supply lines. These rules will introduce new concepts such as unknown units (Direct Action Cadres and Political Action Cadres for the insurgent player) as well as Breakdown Battalions for the COIN player plus several other rules tweaks so that players can fight an insurgency/counter-insurgency campaign. There will be at least four scenarios in the final product*:<br/><br/><br/>     DPRK insurgency in an occupied North Korea<br/>     ROK insurgency in an occupied South Korea<br/>     ROC insurgency in an occupied Taiwan<br/>     Polish insurgency in an occupied Poland<br/><br/><br/> <br/>NEXT WAR ADDITIONS<br/> \t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCamp HumphreysThe United States is building a mega base in South Korea at Camp Humphrey's. These rules alter the way US reinforcements enter the peninsula and relieve the burden on Busan. It also offers opportunities for the DPRK player to interfere with those reinforcements.<br/> \t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPatriots, S-300/400s, and THAADThis provides new, expanded rules for the use of these systems as well as providing all new updated counters. Players will be able to attempt to defend against Air Strikes as well as shoot down incoming Cruise Missiles (Patriot, S-300/S-400) or Ballistic Missiles (THAAD).<br/> \t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDPRK NukesThe DPRK is deeply intent on weaponizing its missiles. These rules provide for that option, along with an &quot;Assured Destruction&quot; mechanism by which the DPRK can be incinerated for using them.<br/> The above three additions are meant to be used together, but players are free to pick and choose amongst them.<br/> \t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCombined &quot;Sub&quot;-SystemStraight from a Next War player comes an excellent idea on combining the Submarine Marker rules from Supplement #1 with the Series ASW/Submarine Threat Level rules. This provides a framework for using the rules in that way.<br/> \t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSubmarine Marker Rules for Next War: PolandUsed either in conjunction with the combined rules above or stand-alone with the Submarine Marker rules from the Supplement, this will contain new counters and rules for applying those rules to the situation in Next War: Poland.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tAdditonal Cyber Warfare Markers\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tUpdated Order of Battle for the PRC in Next War: Taiwan<br/>SPECIAL<br/><br/>This entire supplement* eventually will be available for free download via the Next War Series Support Site, including PDF files for the required counters (which will be DIY). This P500 item exists for those of you who wish to have GMT produce it.<br/> <br/>     The Insurgency rules available online will contain only a single scenario.

However will it be what you expect? Why is another spaceship so close to yours? Why is it so far off course? ... Silicio will guide you along the discovery of numerous events in waiting behind the &quot;Kraken&quot; on an apparently inhospitable planet, against a totally unexpected enemy.<br/><br/>This box too contains fantastic miniatures, new boards, new objects and a mini narrative campaign with 10 missions, plus 5 new exploration missions. Silicio&rsquo;s creatures are classified into three types; at the lowest level of the scale, we have the Babooms, obtained by recycling the oldest remains of the Kraken crew. These beings, turned completely crazy by the transformation, will throw themselves onto our Heroes, with no regard for danger.  The O.R.C. are lethal assassins who kill their victims with hard-hearted ruthlessness. Silent, and almost invisible, they will put the cold blood of Achab and company to the test. A.D.E., a true killing machine... is the largest miniature that LMS has ever produced. Driven by an O.R.C., this exoskeleton is able to create an incredible amount of fire. Its physical defense is almost impenetrable, but its gynoid nature means it can be used not only by the Enemies...<br/>And of course, how could we not speak of their leader? The first specimen of the Andromeda model, having awakened, has decided to rebel against its owners, killing them only to bring them back to life as mechanical creatures of its own invention. Andromeda is driven by an atavistic hatred for living creatures, second only to her hate for her &ldquo;younger sister&rdquo; who replaced her.<br/><br/>This is a Kickstarter exclusive expansion.<br/><br/>",

When a Square symbol is rolled on the Summoning Roll, the Spawning Point will spawn the enemies listed on the corresponding Enemy card and then the Spawning Token is moved forward to Zone 2. A Triangle result will make the Spawning Point continue where it's at, and a Circle result will move the Spawning Point back to Zone 3.<br/><br/>This mobile nature of the Encampment Tile Set brings a new and fresh experience when defending the Citadel! With enemies appearing on Zones 2 and 3, the pressure builds up on the Heroes! Assault units will be one step closer and the Catapult won't be as strong when the Spawning Points are on Zone 2's, but on the other hand, Heavy Units that Spawn on Zone 2 will have to move to Zone 3 before they start firing upon the Citadel, which will buy the Heroes and the Citadel some time!

He welds the demon-sword, Rubilax, which hosts a demon of the same name, and is in charge of keeping the demon from escaping into the real world.<br/><br/>In Krosmaster: Arena, Percedal is a an exclusively melee fighter; his only offensive skill requires him to be right next to his target to attack. To help him get close, he can use his other skill to jump around to different areas, giving him one of the highest mobility in the game. If he is paired up with some of his teammates from the Wakfu anime, who are also promotional figures, he gains the ability to hit harder with his attacks while also allowing him to have an easier time preventing enemies from escaping from his grasp.<br/><br/>",

This edition has updated game manual, counters, player aid card and map.  The game map is now printed on a heavy paper stock in vibrant color and also includes a newly designed full-color box.

        "description": "When Nazi armies launched their sneak attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, Spanish fascists exulted. Still nursing deep hatreds from the Soviet role in the Spanish Civil War, thousands volunteered to fight alongside the Germans. Spanish dictator Francisco Franco organized them into a &ldquo;Blue Division&rdquo; to carry the fight to the Russians and, not coincidentally, send the most politically active fascists far away from Madrid.<br/><br/>Blue Division is a supplement to the Panzer Grenadier series, focusing on the actions of this unit between 1941 and 1943. Organized as a standard German infantry division, the Spanish unit fought well in some of the hardest fighting of the campaign. This module is not playable by itself, but requires ownership of Eastern Front and Road to Berlin to play all of the scenarios.<br/><br/>All the new pieces represent Spanish volunteer forces: infantry, ski, engineer, motorcycle, bicycle and machine-gun troops; anti-tank guns, mortars and artillery, and of course leaders. Scenarios cover actions of these units between their arrival on the Eastern Front in October, 1941 and their departure almost exactly two years later.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>20 Scenarios<br/>77 pieces<br/><br/>This game is part of the Panzer Grenadier series<br/><br/>",

Slovak troops became the first Axis forces to fight alongside the Germans, joining in the invasion of Poland in September 1939. They also marched into the Soviet Union in 1941. After five years as the most minor of allies, the Slovaks turned against the fascists and fought with the victorious Allies in the last year of the war.<br/><br/>First Axis is a 64-page book supplement to the Panzer Grenadier series, focused on the battles of the Slovak Army against the Hungarians, Poles, Soviets and Germans. There are 30 new scenarios plus background articles on the armies and weapons involved and unit organization diagrams.

Master wizards from the circles at Greyhaven and Nerekhall bolster their ranks, wielding destructive power and an arsenal of runebound shards to devastate their foes. Battle standards with histories as long as the Baronies of Daqan swirl in the wind, while the roar of lion horns stiffens the backs of wavering soldiers. Every company is led by a champion, one who has faced death time and again, yet has survived and now invites others to draw strength from his own stolid bravery.<br/><br/>The Daqan Infantry Command Unit Upgrade Expansion introduces four brand-new figures to the armies of the Daqan Lords&mdash;a Banner Guard, a Wizard, a Champion, and a Cornicen. Alongside these figures, you&rsquo;ll find eighteen new upgrade cards, many of which include ways to bring these new figures into your armies. For instance, you may choose to support one of your units with the Lance Corporal upgrade card, implanting the Champion figure into the ranks of your unit. As long as the Champion figure is alive, you gain the benefit of the Lance Corporal card, which significantly boosts your tactical flexibility!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In March of 2011, Libyans in opposition to Colonel Muammar Gaddafi and his government took up arms. For eight months, the opposition, fighting under an interim governing body, the National Transitional Council (NTC), fought Colonel Gaddafi&rsquo;s Loyalist forces all across the country. In October, during a fierce battle in the coastal city of Sirte, Gaddafi was captured and killed.<br/><br/>Days of Villainy is an expansion that can be played with ANY core/base games of the Lock 'n Load Tactical series.  Days of Villainy depicts four of the fierce battles that occurred during the Libyan Civil War, including Colonel Gaddafi&rsquo;s final epic confrontation. Both sides are loaded for bear, armed with RPG-7s and FN MAG and PKM machine guns. The Loyalists have the armored support of BTR-60s and T-55s, but the NTC rebels have plenty of well-armed Technicals to drive into battle, as well as KPV heavy machine guns and the aid of seasoned fighters from the Katiba Tiger and Al-Saiqa commando brigades.<br/><br/>Scenarios Include:<br/><br/>&bull;    Hold or Die: An armored column of Loyalist forces attempted to retake the vital oil hub of Marsa al-Brega, on the road to Benghazi. A tough fight was ahead of them, and the sun was setting.<br/><br/>&bull;    On the Road to Sirte: A convoy of NTC rebels and Al-Saiqa commandos tasked with delivering ammunition to Harawa was ambushed by a small force of Loyalists. Despite the initial blasts of roadside mines, the remnants of the convoy had to push through.<br/><br/>&bull;    Assault on Bab Al-Aziziya: In late August, NTC rebels entered Tripoli. Many neighborhoods were easily taken, but the Bab Al Aziziya compound, symbol of Gaddafi&rsquo;s contemptible regime, was still intact. The compound had become a fortress that had to be taken.<br/><br/>&bull;    Game Over: On October 20th, 2011, an American Predator drone identified a Loyalist convoy leaving the city of the pro-Gaddafi stronghold of Sirte. The drone and French aircraft in the area attacked the convoy, and NTC rebels in the sector closed in on the commotion. Little did they know that Gaddafi was a passenger in the convoy. The stage was set for a vicious, climactic battle.<br/><br/>UPDATE: All of our manuals and guides can be Downloaded, Viewed, and even printed right from our LnLP Online Library: We now have an Online Library of all, well almost all of our manuals.

The nobility of the land has had enough of you princes never being able to settle for an heir for the country. Therefore, the nobles have begun to interfere with your disputes. On your visits to the various buildings, it may now occur that you meet a noble with a political agenda of his own. In some cases, he welcomes you and helps you in your quest, while in other cases he tries to make life as difficult as possible for you. Will you be able to keep the nobles at your side in your struggles against the other princes so that at last a new, worthy king can be elected?<br/><br/>Rattus Cartus: Nobilis, the first expansion for Rattus Cartus (a card game based on the Rattus board game) includes 18 different buildings with players using all or only some of them each game to provide a wide variety of play. This first expansion also includes special cards (Books, Horses, Lances, Privilegs, Wizard Staffs and Diplomats) and extra rat tokens; a second module in this expansion includes noble tokens.<br/><br/>",

These epic conflicts are won and lost by BattleMechs, 30-foot-tall, humanoid titans of metal bristling with high-intensity lasers, rapid-fire autocannon and dozens of other lethal weapons; enough firepower to level entire city blocks. Your elite force of MechWarriors drive these juggernauts into battle, blasting at your opponent's 'Mechs in a deadly game of kill or be killed. Will they become instant legends, or forgotten casualties? Only your skill and luck will determine their fate.<br/><br/>Drawing on years of experience, this book combines the best of the BattleTech board game into a unified whole. BattleTech Master Rules is entirely restructured and streamlined; it is the same game, but like you've never seen it before. This book includes the complete game rules, a quick-and-easy scenario creation system, the Battle Value point system for evaluating 'Mechs and balancing forces, and revised and expanded miniatures rules.<br/><br/>User comment:<br/><br/>This was the default, complete ruleset for BattleTech at the time of printing, superceding the earlier BattleTech Compendium: Rules of Warfare.  Again, no rules were included for AeroTech or BattleSpace units; this ruleset was dedicated to ground-based combat.<br/><br/>These rules were revised and re-issued several times.  The original FASA edition was published in 1998, and was then substantially updated and re-issued as the FASA Revised edition in 2001, one of the last BattleTech sourcebooks produced by FASA.<br/><br/>In 2002, the BattleTech license was taken over by FanPro, and in 2003 they revised the Master Rules and reossued them as the Classic BattleTech Master Rules, Revised in a softback format, followed by a hardback edition in 2004.<br/><br/>The BattleTech: Master Rules were finally superceded when Fanpro released the first edition of Classic BattleTech: Total Warfare in 2006.<br/><br/>",

In this set players can find five intelligent little creatures that are able to create a magical link with their humanoid friends.<br/><br/>The ancient scrolls of the Archmagi classify Lawful familiars into three types, each characterized by a deep bond with their owner: Domestic (Dog); Wild (Boar, Horned Lizard, Owl); Legendary (Pixie).<br/><br/>Each of these Familiars provides valuable help on the battlefield or grants peculiar abilities to its owner, such as the superior sense of smell of a Dog or mystic enchantments of a Pixie. But this deep bond has a downside. When a Familiar dies, its owner suffers a terrible mental shock, which hampers their skills for a time.<br/><br/>This expansion can be used with any Sword &amp; Sorcery Quest or Campaign (Immortal Souls or Ancient Chronicles), by simply shuffling the Familiar cards into the Treasure deck.<br/><br/>",

Battle your friends, family, and hyper-intelligent pets by drawing and playing from a deck of unique cards that'll either help you, thwart others, or mix things up for the sheer hell of it! To win the game, you just need to start your turn with exactly 10 cards in your hand but if you think that'll be easy, you're wrong (wronger than a duck wearing shoes - and that's pretty damn wrong).<br/><br/>This follows the same rules as the regular Muffin Time game.  Players draw a card on their turn and can choose to &quot;place&quot; up to three trap cards out of their hand. As a second part of their turn they either pick up one card or play one action card, which are all unique and can have wide-ranging consequences on the other players or game as a whole<br/><br/>The game ends an a player wins when someone starts their turn holding exactly 10 cards.<br/><br/>This deluxe version includes cards from the Pie Flavour and Rainbow booster packs so contains 200 cards (the standard 120 plus 40 from each booster).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Part of David Schroeder's &quot;Der Weltkrieg&quot; wargame series.<br/><br/>Gorlice-Tarnow Breakthrough: May 1915<br/><br/>The head of the German armies, von Falkenhayn, wants the focus of the German operations in the war to be on the western front. Yet to make this a reality, he feels that relief must first be provided to the endangered Austro-Hungarians. Recent Russian pressure had almost cracked the final Austro-Hungarian defensive lines in the Carpathians, and new pressure was being brought to bear on Germany's weak ally by the Italians, who had just entered the war.<br/><br/>To help the Austro-Hungarians, a new German army is formed under the capable von Mackensen, and placed in the line east of Crackow. After a furious hurricane barrage, von Mackensen attacks and completely pierces the Russian lines. A Russian retreat ensues that enables the Central Powers' forces to recapture most of Galicia.<br/><br/>Von Falkenhayn wanted to stop operations at this point and shift to the west, but pressure from the Kaiser, at the insistance of Hindenburg and Ludendorff, resulted in a widening of the offensive. Attacks were then launched in the northern sector of the eastern front as well. Enveloped on two sides, the Russians reacted with their classic response, a retreat back into Russia, leaving Russian Poland to the Germans.<br/><br/>The Central Powers offensive wound down as they struggled to supply troops hundreds of miles past the supply heads. The offensive has saved Austria-Hungary from immediate peril, but it does not knock Russia out of the war. And instead of enabling von Falkenhayn to focus on the west, most of the newly created German forces are fed into the increasing vastness of the eastern front.<br/><br/><br/>The Brusilov Offensive: June 1916<br/><br/>In response to French pleas for help to relieve the pressure at Verdun, the Russian STAVKA authorizes a major offensive. General Brusilov plans attacks all along the front of his Southwest Army Group aiming primarily at Austro-Hungarian positions. His belief is that attacks across the width of his front will prevent the enemy from being able to quickly reinforce areas under local attack.<br/><br/>The Austro-Hungarians are caught off-guard as their focus is a new offensive of their own in Italy. The Russian attacks achieves numerous breakthroughs in numerous sectors and many Austro-Hungarian units are completely routed. The Russians take hundreds of thousands of prisoners and advance tens of miles, recapturing significant cities.<br/><br/>German reinforcements are rushed from the north and from Verdun. The Germans also take over command of almost the entire eastern front, and Austria-Hungary is placed in a subserviant position. The Russian offensive peters out as Brusilov's forces start to experience supply shortages, and Central Powers' resistance stiffens.<br/><br/>Brusilov had planned on support from Russian armies to the north to pin down German forces with attacks of their own, but they failed to support him. The losses mount and, after months of fighting, the Russians finally call a halt to further attacks.<br/><br/>The Brusilov Offensive did relieve the pressure on the French and it came very close to knocking Austria-Hungary out of the war. Had Brusilov been supported by his peers to the north, and by the Russian Allies (including the hesitant Romanians) the war might well have been won by the Entente in 1916.<br/><br/><br/>This game contains 2 scenarios covering the  1915 Gorlice-Tarnow offensive and the 1916 Brusilov Offensive.<br/><br/>NOTE: This is not a stand-alone game. It requires the ownership of Tannenberg: Eagles in the East / Galicia: The Forgotten Cauldron and Serbia the Defiant / Romania: Transylvanian Gambit to play.<br/><br/>20km/hex<br/>4 days/turn<br/><br/>560 counters (2 countersheets)<br/>3 small maps (4-5N, 4-5E, 5-5S)<br/><br/>Complexity = medium<br/><br/>",

Then, for the enemy turn, roll the 3 dice and assign them low to high left to right across the front enemy line, then take the assigned actions.<br/><br/>Each card has its own damage track. When a card is destroyed, it is removed from the game. Win by destroying all 9 enemy cards. Lose if the enemy destroys your landship.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>The black box version includes the Black Box (a bigger box) which will take sleeved cards.

The expansions are:<br/><br/><br/>    Zooloretto<br/>        The Familiarisation Area &ndash; The familiarisation area fits around the zoo board. It has space for 1 animal tile that can be put there for free. This tile doesn't score any points at the end of the game, neither plus nor minus points. During the game this tile can be moved into the zoo for free or you can trade for an animal in another familiarisation area for 1 coin. So basically this is a temporary &quot;storage&quot; for animals.<br/>        The Petting Zoo &ndash; Each player receives a petting zoo and can place up to two baby animals in this space, receiving one coin for the first animal and two for the second. These animals cannot be moved and generate no points.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>    Aquaretto<br/>        The Trains &ndash; Eighteen train tiles, showing trains in one of four colors or a curved track, are mixed with the other tiles. When you take a train tile, you place it in an empty space in your zoo. Each subsequent train tile must connect to existing ones. Each type of train tile is worth two points at game's end.<br/>        Three Coworker Tiles &ndash; These tiles are placed in the center of the table and can be claimed when a player gets coworkers. Each tile is different and cannot be used by other players once claimed.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/>    Either game<br/>        The Savings Book &ndash; Each player receives a savings book that depicts the numbers 1-4. Instead of a normal action, the player can place a coin on 1 in his savings book. At the end of a round, a coin in the savings book advances one space, returning to the player &ndash; along with an extra coin &ndash; when it reaches 4.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

Players are immersed in a dark world full of destruction and suffering, a world where people are fighting to take back their place after a global nuclear war annihilated all achievements of the human race and all that was left was only a handful of usable resources.<br/><br/>This second edition of RONE includes the core game, plus the New Forces and Awakening expansions in one box. There is new content as well, including features, new art, and add-ons. For back compatibility with the first edition, the cards are populated with an expansion symbol to easily distinguish which card belongs to which expansion.<br/><br/>",

Heroic Mutants are super powerful mutants that replace some of the Advanced Mutants you would normally have in your Gene Pool. Orbs can be used to give an extra power boost to players that land in the Dread Zone, so they can fight their way back to the top of the Arena. Second Wave Basic Mutants give players the ability to choose their starting deck. Finally, the Zombie Horde is a Solo Boss that's designed to challenge even the most experienced Psy Captains!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

As players construct their own warbands from any combination of Super Dungeon models or from a single warband box, Arena promises to be an exciting experience each time.<br/><br/>Super Dungeon introduced the world to the whimsy and charm of chibi-miniature board games inspired by classic video games, and it continues to be the leader in providing a fun and lighthearted family board game experience.

In The Blood of Gondor, your heroes are ambushed on all sides by &quot;hidden cards,&quot; which enter your play area facedown until different effects force them to flip over. The Blood of Gondor Nightmare Deck amplifies the tension and excitement this mechanic creates, adding more effects that cause you to take hidden cards, more effects that flip them over, and a number of nasty surprises that trigger when they're flipped faceup.<br/><br/>Nightmare Decks for The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game allow you to revisit your favorite scenarios cast in the shadows of the game's challenging Nightmare Mode. Featuring deadlier enemies, darker locations, and more terrifying surprises, each Nightmare Deck introduces new, alternate encounter cards and instructions for using them to reshape a scenario's encounter deck. The result? A nightmarish journey through territory you thought you knew, but with twists and turns that will have you on the edge of your seat!<br/><br/>",

Marching onto battlefields in combat armor, these soldiers can shrug off enemy gunfire and are practically invulnerable to infantry small arms fire. Their enemies are much less fortunate. Each member of the Heavy Recon Grenadiers wields two powerful MG 44 rifles designed to mow down Allied infantry in a lead rain. Take command of these elite soldiers, <br/>shrug off enemy fire, and turn the tide of the war!<br/><br/>Three unpainted miniatures are exquisitely sculpted in dynamic battle-ready poses.

        "description": "The &quot;Modern Battles II&quot; Quadrigame consists of four contemporary games.  These games are completely new and individual and are sold separately and as a complete set.<br/><br/>The games included in this Quadrigame are:<br/><br/><br/>    Bundeswehr - Northern Germany, late 1970's (Hypothetical)<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Yugoslavia - The battles for Zagreb, 1979  (Hypothetical, but eerily prescient of a civil war between the Serbs and the Croats.)<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Battle for Jerusalem - a fierce and bloody battle fought between Israeli and Jordanian forces during the Six Day war of 1967.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    DMZ - The Battle for South Korea, late 1970s  (Hypothetical)<br/><br/><br/>The game mechanics used in this series are similar to those found in other Quadrigames. The Standard Rules are identical to those used in the first Modern Battles (Quad).  In this new series the same scale is used (one mile per hex and 12 hours a turn). Units range in size from companies to brigades.  Artillery units have the ability to add to the defensive strength of friendly units being attacked. Artillery has various ranges, some in excess of ten hexes.<br/><br/>Also included (in various games) are rules for Untried units, special river conditions, other special terrain, airpower, ammuniton depletion, B-52 and B-1 bomber attacks, commandos, paratroopers, stacking, garrison units, bridge destruction, militia, artillery suppression, command control, helicopters, replacements and international cooperation.<br/><br/>Movement is sequential and single-phased. Zones of Control are rigid, and combat is mandatory between adjacent units. The Combat Results Tables (there are two, representing different doctrines) use a differential system.  The &quot;Active Combat Results Table&quot; is very bloody, with a large possibility of exchange and elimination, even at low odds. The other table, the &quot;Mobile Combat Results Table&quot; is a bloodless CRT, offering mostly retreat results.<br/><br/>Terrain varies from flat, open plains to some of the most rugged in the world. The terrain effects on combat are taken into account by a system whereby the combat differential is actually altered (column sifts) by the terrain the defending unit occupies.<br/><br/>",

The new line profiles famous regions of Germany during the Middle Ages, when Celts, Romans, and Germans intermingled.<br/><br/>This fixed map covers the Nordrhein-Westfalen area of Germany, which includes the modern-day industrial area around the river Rhein (Rurh). Many BGG-ers will recognize the city of Essen. The geographic features (resource hexes) and cities mirror the approximate location of their real-world counterparts. &quot;Harbors&quot; ring the playing field.<br/><br/>The rules follow closely to standard Catan, with a few notable exceptions:<br/>Players may only build cities in the round intersections denoting actual cities. Because some of the cities are only one hexside apart, the spacing rule requiring two roads between settlements is not in effect. Having built a road to a hex with a settlement, one cannot build a road leaving it until one has build a settlement on the hex. Finally, to obtain the benefit of a harbor, it is only necessary to lay a road on the hexside shaded in red.<br/>Furthermore, victory points can be obtained by building the first road onto a &quot;victory point crossing.&quot; These points are indicated by tokens (e.g. from the Seafarer's expansion) placed there.<br/><br/>",

If there's a match, you add the lowest strength matching die to one of the Great Battle cards along with one of your Participation Markers. You immediately gain the reward on the Troop Position chosen.  <br/>When all 5 Troop positions are filled on a Great Battle, the card is resolved and each Participation marker on that card earns you a share of the Victory Points for that Great Battle. This module also includes 20 Participation Markers and 5 additional Troop dice.<br/><br/>Module #3: Ancient Spells<br/><br/>This is a set of 28 cards (44x68mm) with 2 of 6 unique and powerful actions spread throughout the cards in every possible combination. During setup, shuffle the cards and give 3 to each player. <br/>At any time during your turn, you may play an Ancient Spell card from your hand to perform one of the two available powers. It's important to note that playing an Ancient Spell card is a free action along with your regular action. These spells are meant to augment and boost specific actions, dice, etc.<br/><br/>Module #4: Wraith Dice<br/><br/>This is a set of 5 purple custom dice (16mm - same size as the other dice in the game). During setup, just toss the 5 Wraith Dice into the bag along with the usual dice needed for your number of players. Each die has Strength of 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, and 3, (opposite sides always add up to 4) so they are weaker than the regular Troop dice, but this also means that they're more likely to give you better Discounts if you draft them at the Tactics and Champions Shines, and more likely to pay out more gold if you draft them from Gold Shrine. <br/>Wraith dice are considered WILD when completing any Battle Plan. So, even though they're weak, they can be any Troop Type you need. Wraith dice are also wild if you put them on a Great Battle card (Module #2). When you draft a Wraith die, it DOES NOT take up a Troop slot on your Player Board! You just set it somewhere on your Camp and use it when you need it most. The flexibility of these new dice will add lots of new play options to your game of Shadow Kingdoms of Valeria.<br/><br/>About the base game:<br/>For years the humans, elves, and dwarves have been slowly encroaching on your territories and slaying your kind in the name of progress. They've built their citadels, keeps, and villages as they push you further into the darkness. Now is the time to rally your troops and lay waste to their kind and bring forth the reign of the Shadow Kingdoms!<br/><br/>You are a Warden hungry for the destruction of Valeria. You must outwit the other Wardens to earn the right to command an army for the Shadow Kingdoms. Visit dark Shrines to gain minions, magic, gems, and gold to fuel your war machine. Command monsters into battle to conquer the lands and earn Victory Points. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game will be declared the winner.<br/><br/>On your turn, you must move your Warden from its current location to a new location. When your Warden enters one of the 5 Shrines, you first take any available die from the Shrine and place it on your player board, then perform the Shrine action associated with the Shrine.<br/><br/>There are 5 troop types (die colors) in the game: Goblin (green), Orc (red), Skeleton (white), Gargoyle (purple), and Gnoll (brown). Send your Warden to the Camp on your player board to use your minion dice to resolve battle plans and place Victory tokens on your Campaign board.<br/><br/>",

While multi-affiliation decks have always been a possibility, Allies of Necessity offers more tools to help you than ever before&mdash;starting with new affiliation cards, which offer new deckbuilding requirements and special abilities. What&rsquo;s more, you&rsquo;ll find iconic characters from Rogue One, Star Wars Rebels, and the Darth Vader comics throughout the cycle: in fact, this first Force Pack includes Doctor Aphra, Director Krennic, Captain Cassian Andor, and Jyn Erso.<br/><br/>With eight new objective sets (two copies each of four distinct sets), and twelve brand-new affiliation cards (two for each affiliation), Allies of Necessity promises to change your games like never before!<br/><br/>Contains objective sets 261-1264.<br/><br/>",

And Argon Gass is one of them.<br/><br/>Argon Gass plays as a close range fighter, where his short range Sonartillery makes short work of his foe's armor.

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.<br/><br/>During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.<br/><br/>This special edition is sold exclusively by the German trade company M&uuml;ller. It comes in a similar metal box as previous special editions and contains the Carcassonne base game along with the expansion set Carcassonne: Expansion 6 – Count, King & Robber and Die Belagerer which is a new six-tile version of Carcassonne: Die Katharer (with new graphics but similar to the Rio Grande Games (2008) release).<br/><br/>",

It is not your typical game expansion, but is a completely new game, with several new rules, and potentially new strategies. It is built on the firm foundation of the original game and should be a quick learn for experienced players.<br/><br/>There are two main changes to the game: The map is now a 4 by 6 grid tiles representing Germany, and the Directorship, that is, who owns the track is determined by who transported the most players for a company, not who bought the most shares. Additionally, being Director means that you get 5 dice in income during your turn, and not 4 dice.<br/><br/>These two changes alone should make for a very interesting game.<br/><br/>It must be said that the game does not include any new dice. The standard set of dice in the original game has not been expanded. Some of the same rules apply: You only build or lay track on one or two tiles, as soon as you leave a tile, the track dice are removed and the station dice are left behind.<br/><br/>New terrain features are rivers with special crossing rules for them, and that you can only build stations in specific locations indicated on the map. When you build a station at that location, you get the number of passengers for that station, 3,000 or 5,000, plus an additional 1,000 for every &quot;share&quot; symbol or question mark die you spend. This makes it easier for a player to get back into the game if they have fallen behind.<br/><br/>",

The main difference between the two editions is that the European interpretation is much more co-operative as a lot of the information is shared by all, making it a more open, but somehow also a faster and more atmospheric experience for all involved.<br/><br/>Since there were only 10 solvable cases that came with the base game, it was inevitable that additional cases had to be published to keep its players' base entertained. Both publishers happily obliged, each releasing their own additional sets. Jumbo only released 5 extra cases that appeared in Dutch, French, Italian and German, meaning that not all of their European language editions saw additional cases beyond the initial 10. And like before, the murders are pretty tough cases to crack, as even with all the available information revealed, some educated guesses willstill have to be made by the competing sleuths.<br/><br/>",

The D.VII was noted for its high maneuverability and ability to climb at high angles of attack, its remarkably docile stall, and its reluctance to spin. It was flown by a number of famous German aces such as Hermann G&ouml;ring, Gotthard Sachsenberg and Rudolf Stark.<br/><br/>Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>This is not a complete game.<br/><br/>",

So, instead of saying &quot;broccoli,&quot; you'd say something like &quot;green thing you eat for live long and have good health.&quot; If you mess up and use a big word, such as &quot;vegetable,&quot; you get bopped on the head with a NO !Stick and you lose points.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to score the most points by correctly interpreting words and phrases. The chosen Poet starts off the game with a Poetry Card and tries to get their teammates to say the listed word, using only words with one syllable within a 90-second time limit.<br/><br/>The box contains 500 new double sided cards. That&rsquo;s 2000 new words and phrases to use with Poetry for Neanderthals.<br/><br/>",

Luke Skywalker, hero of the Rebellion, is opposed by Darth Vader, one of the Dark Lords of the Sith. Han Solo, a smuggler from the Outer Rim, is tracked by Jabba the Hutt and his teams of bounty hunters. Princess Leia Organa is taunted and questioned by Grand Moff Tarkin. These enmities and threats bring the characters to life, and now, you can bring some of these rivalries into your games of Star Wars: The Card Game with Scrap Metal, the next Force Pack in the Opposition cycle.<br/><br/>Like the other Force Packs of the cycle, Scrap Metal comes with ten new objective sets (two copies each of five distinct sets), each challenging the way you view the battles between the factions of Star Wars: The Card Game. Here, you&rsquo;ll find a host of new versions of iconic characters, including Jabba the Hutt, C-3PO, R2-D2, and Jek Porkins. With plenty of new fate cards to bring new tension to every edge battle, the rivalries that exist between factions are about to become more explosive and dangerous than ever before!<br/><br/>Contains objective sets 246-250.<br/><br/>",

The bioships, and Species 8472 themselves, were resistant to assimilation by the Borg and had enough firepower to destroy a Borg ship with only a couple of shots. The bioships contained a series of vein-like conduits which carried electrodynamic fluid, possibly for use as an energy source.<br/><br/>Eight of these ships could collect and combine their firepower, using an energy focusing ship, which enabled them to fire a blast so powerful it could destroy a planet. When the Borg entered fluidic space, they were forced back by this resistance.<br/><br/>This ship is part of the 4th wave of expansion packs for the Star Trek: Attack Wing game.<br/><br/>",

All the basic game rules still apply in addition to the expansion rules below. You can combine it with other expansions - but at your own risk &ndash; that is, there will be no official rules for these combinations.<br/><br/>Contents<br/>12 new land tiles for peasant revolts with symbols for the respective features.<br/><br/>Peasant Revolts tile<br/><br/>5x cities<br/><br/>4x roads<br/><br/>3x monasteries<br/>Rules<br/>Preparation<br/>Shuffle the 12 land tiles of this mini-expansion. Put 3 of them back into the box (without looking at them). Those tiles will not be used in this game. Shuffle the remaining 9 tiles and the other land tiles together.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>1. Placing a tile<br/>The peasants revolt<br/><br/>As soon as you draw a peasant revolt tile, a revolt takes place. Place the tile in front of you. [1] Now check, if one or more of your meeples are standing on features shown on the diamond-shaped symbol of the tile (city, road or monastery), and if those meeples are &quot;unprotected&quot; or &quot;protected&quot;.<br/><br/>All of your unprotected meeples on the respective features, must be returned into your supply immediately.<br/><br/>Every protected meeple on the respective features scores 2 points. Protected meeples remain protected after the revolt.<br/>     <br/>(How you can protect your meeples, will be explained in 2. Placing a meeple.)<br/><br/>Note: If you had to return at least one meeple, the revolt is over and you continue with your normal turn.<br/><br/>Example 1: You draw a land tile with the peasant revolt symbol for roads (symbol enlarged in this example).<br/>Your unprotected meeple is standing on a road on the left. Put the meeple back into your supply. Your protected meeple on the right stays on the tile and scores 2 points.<br/>The revolt is over. The blue meeple has not been affected. Now, place the land tile according to the usual rules and continue your turn.<br/>The peasant revolt moves on to the next player<br/><br/>If you do not have to return a meeple to your supply, because none of your meeples are standing on affected features or because all of your meeples, on affected features, are protected, the peasant revolt moves on and hits the player to your left. They also check, in the same way as described before, whether or not the revolt affects them and if they score points for protected meeples. If they, also are not affected by the peasant revolt, it moves on to the next player.<br/><br/>This continues until a player has to return at least 1 meeple to their supply, or none of the players have been affected. Now, place the land tile according to the usual rules and continue your turn.<br/><br/>Note! Only players, who have to check their meeples during the peasant revolt, score points for their protected meeples. Players who are not hit by the peasant revolt cannot score any points for protected meeples.<br/><br/>Example 2: You draw a land tile with the peasant revolt symbol for cities (symbol enlarged in this example). All of your meeples in cities are protected and you score 4 points.<br/>The peasant revolt moves on to Blue. Blue is sitting to your left, and continues to check, if and how the peasant revolt affects them. Blue has 1 protected meeple in the city on the left, which scores 2 points. The unprotected meeples have to be returned into Blue&rsquo;s supply. That is how the revolt ends and you place the land tile according to the usual rules and continue your turn.<br/>2. Placing a meeple<br/>Protecting a meeple from a peasant revolt<br/><br/>If you place a meeple on the tile just placed, you may also protect this very meeple, for the cost of 4 points. To do so, move your meeple on the score board back by 4 spaces. It is possible to score negative points. Next, &ldquo;lay down&rdquo; this meeple. This meeple has now joined the farmers. [2]<br/><br/>Example: Protecting a meeple<br/>Each time you do not place a meeple on the tile you just have placed, [3] you may protect one of your meeples standing on tiles for the cost of 2 points.<br/><br/>Farmers cannot be protected. They are never affected by peasant revolts.<br/><br/>A meeple &ldquo;lying down&rdquo; is protected from a peasant revolt. In case the revolt affects you, you score 2 points for each protected meeple in an affected feature (see 1. Placing a tile).<br/><br/>3. Scoring a feature<br/>When scoring a feature, a protected meeple is treated like a normal meeple. It is returned into your supply after the feature has been scored. After that, it loses its protection from peasant revolts. This means, that if you place that meeple again, it is unprotected once again.<br/><br/>Example: The city has been completed. You have the majority of meeples (2 in this case) and score 10 points.<br/>Blue does not score any points. Return all meeples from the city back into your supplies and place them upright. They are now unprotected once more.<br/>Final scoring<br/>Final scoring is performed according to use usual rules. When scoring a feature, a protected meeple is treated like a normal meeple.<br/><br/>",

The game contains the same counter sheet as Siege, damage record sheets (to keep track of bombardment damage), a set of four map sheets that can be assembled to depict a walled medieval town with a citadel, and an eight page booklet describing rules for the specific features on the map sheets as well as a few siege rule clarifications. The four map set was also available separately through Standard Games and Publications. The boxed game does not come with any specific scenarios or guidelines for designing your own, however there are several fan made scenarios that are available on the web. While this expansion essentially does not introduce any new rules or counters, the four maps that make up the fortified town were the largest single castle/town available at that time and are of the same high quality as the other game maps in the series. This set of maps really allow players, for the first time, with the opportunity to play out siege battles that are epic in size.<br/><br/>",

Take advantage of their phenomenal speed to reach an enemy walker no matter where it hides; they are able to ignore obstacles in their path by flying over them!

        "description": "Included in Top Cover: Fighting Wings Journal #1.<br/><br/>Australia&rsquo;s Pacific Air War: In a one-sided fight over Rabaul on January 20th, 1942, Japanese Zeros annihilated a small force of RAAF Wirraway armed-trainers, which were all that stood between Japanese air power and Northern Australia. Little bothered by the smattering of slow climbing American P-40 fighters subsequently rushed to the area, high flying Japanese planes raided the Northern Territories an average of four times a month during 1942.<br/><br/>This changed dramatically in early 1943 when the rapidly expanding RAAF deployed an entire wing of British built Spitfires to Darwin. Led by Australian ace Clive &ldquo;Killer&rdquo; Caldwell, the Spitfires quickly and forcibly confronted the Japanese. At this same time, the RAAF fielded another famous British fighter, the long-range, twin engine Beaufighter. These fast, ten-gun behemoths had an offensive role, ranging far and wide to attack Japanese bases and shipping as far away as Timor, Rabaul and all of New Guinea. Mid-1943 also saw the deployment of the Boomerang to New Guinea. This nimble homegrown fighter, though lacking in air combat ability, proved excellent as a ground support plane.  Thus, whether defending the north, sweeping the seas or bombing bunkers, Australian aircrews and their planes, were a decisive factor in reversing the Japanese fortunes of war in 1943.<br/><br/>Top Cover No.1: This is the first Fighting Wings game system expansion to be produced. This module explores the contribution of the Royal Australian Air Force to the fighting in the South Pacific in 1942 and 1943. You will need to own Whistling Death to fully access many of the scenarios contained herein.<br/><br/>The Module includes the following:<br/><br/>    Four New Allied Aircraft - CAC Wirraway, CAC Boomerang, RAAF Spitfire Mk.V and  the RAAF Beaufighter Mk.VIc. <br/>    Four New Japanese Aircraft &ndash; H6K4 Mavis, Ki.45 Nick, Ki.46 Dinah and a revised Ki.43 Oscar-II.<br/>    One die cut counter sheet with 140 counters, featuring the new aircraft and additional game markers. <br/>    One Top-View Operational Scale map of the Darwin area of Australia.<br/>    Thirty new air-to-air and air-to-ground scenarios for Whistling Death.<br/><br/><br/>(from Clash of arms website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Revised and Expanded edtion of the 2006 book Africa<br/> North Africa<br/><br/>On 29 August the revised edition of North Africa will hit the shelves. This mighty tome comes in at 264 pages and takes into account the feedback we have received over the years since Afrika was initially released, as well as new research that the team has unearthed.<br/><br/>The first major change is that not only is North Africa much larger than its predecessor, but it will also be in hard cover. This means that it will stand up to the rigors of gaming like never before as we give our Late War armies a break and head back to North Africa and Italy.<br/><br/>The second major change is that a number of the companies have been split up into Africa, Tunisia or Italy lists. This means we have been able to more accurately represent the forces fighting in each of the theatres. The organisation diagrams for choosing your company have also been changed to the new style. This makes it much easier for new and experienced players to put a force together.<br/><br/>The last major change is that we have added in some of the new units that you have come to see regularly in Late War such as heavy artillery, as well some new ones like British 3.7cm AA guns. <br/> As a result of the increased size (50+ pages larger than before) we have also been forced to increase the retail price of the book, making it the same price as the rulebook. Taking customer feedback into account regarding Fortress Europe we felt that it was important to include all the lists that you knew and loved (as well as a few more that will become favourites), rather than dropping anything out.<br/><br/>North Africa will be in stores 29 August 2009!<br/><br/>",

Aerospace Fighters carrying heavy bomb loads hunted for the enemy airbase. At 1500 hours, the main 'Mech force moved out. The motorized infantry had pulled out about three hours earlier, and the tanks, both tracked and hover had left an hour ago. At 2000 hours, the hydrofoil assault force skirted the enemy's rear echelon and called for support from the artillery fire base. The battle was joined.<br/><br/>The MechWarrior's most complete and accurate sourcebook.<br/><br/>The BattleTech Manual is a 104 page compilation and expansion of the rules for the BattleTech series of games: BattleTech, CityTech, and AeroTech. Considered the final version for these games, the included rules take precedence over any previous rules.<br/><br/>Some rules have been clarified or slightly modified in this manual.<br/><br/>Additionally, there are new rules covering a wide variety of equipment including VTOLs (helicopters), conventional aircraft, fortifications, minefields, naval vessels, and special weapons.<br/><br/>Many of the rules in this book are similar to those in MechWarrior. Players wishing more realism should use the rules in The BattleTech Manual, while players wishing a quick system should use MechWarrior.<br/><br/>Sections contain new rules for using:<br/>Helicopters<br/>Naval Vessels<br/>Conventional Aircraft<br/>Artillery<br/>Dropships on the battlefield<br/>Anti-'Mech Infantry<br/>And much more<br/><br/>In addition, this book presents complete generation rules for all vehicles, from BattleMechs to submarines.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;ll create this adversary by combining a Nemesis (who they are), with an Archetype (what army they lead), and a Scenario (what they are doing). For example you may battle Erling Khan the Deathdealer who is Leading the Invasion. Each of the four different oversized Nemesis Cards comes with a large standee and a unique &quot;Nemesis Deck&quot;.<br/>At various points in the game, you will reveal the top card of their Nemesis Deck. Each card can generate multiple different effects depending on the game state. The Endbringer defense is spread out among Symmetry Cards, one per battlefield (per player in the game). As Symmetry cards take damage, put damage counters on them. When a Symmetry Card has damage equal to its defense, it is destroyed. Flip it over to reveal a devastating effect the Endbringer unleashes in retaliation. Destroy all the Symmetry Cards and you win the game!<br/><br/>",

Any Allied forces that don't fall to Grenadier X and any zombie squad he joins may find themselves concerned by the sinister presence of TotenMeister. Not only did this Blutkreuz Korps experiment manage to cheat death and become both Damage Resilient and ferociously strong, but her supply of Wiederbelebungsserum allows her to recover from nearly any wound. With their unholy strength, these Heroes lend resilience to any Axis army, with or without squads of Axis Zombies to join them.<br/><br/>Additionally, the Axis Hero Pack introduces Stefan, a deadly Oberleutnant who uses some of the Allies' most effective tricks against them, literally fighting fire with fire with his Flammenwerfer 40.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Stormy Seas expansion for Tranquility consists of three mini-expansions that significantly change the level of difficulty as well as introducing a nice variety of rule changes that make the game even more replayable.<br/><br/>1. Jagged Rocks: The game begins with the Jagged Rocks card placed randomly on one of the six border cards on the left-hand side of the grid; this row is considered as temporarily impenetrable so no cards may be placed into it.<br/><br/>2. Sea Monsters: The game begins with three, four or five Sea Monster cards shuffled into the deck before it is dealt out to players (depending on the level of difficulty the players wish to add). On their turn the player may play their Sea Monster card into the grid by placing it on top of any previously played card. The Sea Monster destroys the card and then both cards are removed from the game.<br/><br/>3. Storm &amp; Compass: The game begins with six Storm cards shuffled into the deck. The six Compass cards are placed to the side of the playing area. A player resolves a Storm card as soon as it is drawn.<br/><br/>Yellow Storm: The player places the Yellow Storm card face up in front of them and immediately discards down to three cards which is their new hand limit until the Storm card is removed.<br/><br/>Purple Storm: The player places the Purple Storm on one of the six border cards on the left-hand side of the grid on a row with at least one empty space. This marks the entire row as temporarily impenetrable so no cards may be placed into it.<br/><br/>Orange Storm: The player places the Orange Storm card face up in front of them. For all future turns the player may now only 1. Play next to an existing card, discarding the appropriate number of cards as per the usual rules or 2. Discard two cards.<br/><br/>Compass: Compass cards may be played to help the players navigate the Storms and remove playing restrictions. Compass cards may be acquired in three different ways: 1. When the start card is played, the players earn one Compass card to use. 2. By filling an entire row with consecutive cards (e.g. 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17) and 3. If a player chooses to discard their whole hand.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The sequel for exciting quiz evenings has 200 new questions and thus 2,000 possible answers. As in the original game, the topics here are wide-ranging and can make the two to eight players, ages 14 and up, ponder: Which US Presidents died in office: Kennedy, Roosevelt and/or perhaps Eisenhower? What are the first names of the rock guitarists from Led Zeppelin or Police and in which country were Formula 1 world champions like Vettel or Lauda born?<br/><br/>There are ten answer options to choose from for each question, which are covered with markers. Whoever has a turn chooses one of them, checks whether it is correct and passes the smart box on to the next player. If you don't want to give an answer anymore, it's better to pass, because if you get it wrong, you lose all the points you have collected in the current round. Who knows the right answers or guesses and gambles best?<br/><br/>The pack contains 100 double-sided expansion cards with new questions and can also be mixed with the cards from the original game.<br/><br/>Only playable with the Smartbox from the original game!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>200 neue Fragen, 2.000 neue Antworten &ndash; die Erweiterung &bdquo;Neue Fragen 3.0&ldquo; bringt mit Zusatzfragen zu unterschiedlichen Themengebieten weitere Herausforderungen f&uuml;r Quizfans.<br/><br/>F&uuml;r alle Smartboxen der Smart 10-Reihe gibt es noch mehr Abwechslung durch die Erweiterung &bdquo;Neue Fragen 3.0&ldquo;.

When those gods saw mankind mistreat the world, though, the deities saw fit to create two horrific punishments: the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse and da Vinci's inventions. These ungodly forces on Earth chime the resounding gong of the end of days, and now only an expedition dispatched by the E.O.P. can prevent the Apocalypse from destroying our world.<br/><br/>This expansion pack includes three great scenarios and the giant Journey to the Tomb tile, each adding great gameplay and immersive stories that will thrill your senses. Will you survive the plagues of Egypt and escape the grasp of Death himself? Can your team undo the prophecy and make their own fate in a race against the Four Horsemen? Will you recover the secret to da Vinci&rsquo;s greatest invention&mdash;and greatest mistake&mdash;in order to stop the dead from rising and destroying humankind?<br/><br/>The Journey to the Tomb a dangerous one and the great outdoors can lead to great treasures but also great hazards. By making this journey, the adventurers can reap the rewards of their well-stocked nautical plane, but they must face the beasts of the island&rsquo;s jungles.<br/><br/>To aid you in your quest, included are two new adventurers, equipped and ready to venture into the Tomb. In addition, you&rsquo;ll find two lavishly illustrated rooms to explore. While on these new expeditions, you&rsquo;ll find new items, artifacts, stories, companions, and creatures&mdash;all in your quest to discover the Secrets of the Lost Tomb: The Great Apocalypse.<br/><br/>",

It's triangular (about 6.5 inches on a side) and is about 2.5 inches thick. On the middle of the right side is a long zipper that opens the bag. It comes in two flavors, tan with brown text and pink with purple text.<br/><br/>The bag has a special rule for use in Munchkin games: &quot;When you take a Munchkin d6 out of the Munchkin Dice Bag and roll it, the Munchkin head counts as a 7, not a 1.&quot; This is referring to the special Munchkin d6s that come with Munchkin core sets, and which have a Munchkin Man head in place of the single pip for the &quot;1&quot;. (These dice can also be purchased separately.) So while you can use the Munchkin Dice Bag to store a large number of dice, the special rule only applies to the d6s with the Munchkin head.<br/><br/>In addition to the special rule, the tan dice bag comes with two Munchkin cards.

She turned toward Conan, her bosom heaving, her eyes flashing. Fierce fingers of wonder caught at his heart. She was slender, yet formed like a goddess at once lithe and voluptuous. Her only garment was a broad silken girdle. Her white ivory limbs and the ivory globes of her breasts drove a beat of fierce passion through the Cimmerian's pulse, even in the panting fury of battle. Her rich black hair, black as a Stygian night, fell in rippling burnished clusters down her supple back. Her dark eyes burned on the Cimmerian.&quot;<br/><br/>&mdash; Robert E. Howard, Queen of the Black Coast.<br/><br/>This expansion lets you bring alternate versions of Conan the Barbarian and B&ecirc;lit, as envisioned by the amazing and highly praised artist Xavier Collette, to your tabletop!<br/><br/>This version of Conan is King Conan! Tall and unbowed, aged, yet wise, he remains a mighty warrior, leading his men from the front as he cleaves through his enemies! This Conan may not be as mobile as his younger self, but he remains a strong fighter who can count on the men he leads to shore up any weaknesses with the Commander skill!<br/><br/>B&ecirc;lit the Princess is a very prominent character in Conan&rsquo;s life as well as a fan favourite. This incarnation gives you a more experienced and lofty B&ecirc;lit, a true Queen of the Black Coast. She has one of the highest skill counts in the game, can support her allies and retains much of the combat prowess of her other incarnations!<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>Two miniatures (King Conan and B&ecirc;lit) and their two character sheets (one side in French, the other in English).<br/><br/>",

The box contains 33 Bonus cards and 4 pages of rules in German.  The cards contains 7 different pictures which have no influence on play, being flavour only.  There are 24 different combinations of bean types, in three Bonus values (30, 50 and 70).<br/><br/>The Bonus cards are shuffled and placed as a pile face down next to the draw pile.  Each player receives 2 Bonus cards (3 cards in a two-player game).  The Bonus cards are placed anywhere in the hand, they do not follow the strict order of the Bean cards.<br/><br/>In Mutabohn, genetic manipulations allow the beans to mutate while they are growing in the field.  Gartenbohnen may become Rote Bohnen.  Rote Bohnen may become Augenbohnen, etc.  Each bean type can be transformed into the next lower value (which has the next higher number of cards) simply by planting this new type of bean on top of the old beans.  Each Bonus card features a series of icons in the corners showing a pattern like AABBC (Small coloured pictures are used instead of letters) --this forms a &quot;gene-code&quot; which must match the pattern of beans in the field in order to play the bonus.<br/><br/>Expands:<br/><br/>     Bohnanza <br/><br/><br/>Mutabohn is part of the Bohnanza family of games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;Wargaming has had a remarkable four decades. Commercial wargames first appeared in the late 1950s, although commercial miniatures and naval gaming date back to the end of the 19th century. Board wargaming had something of a golden age in the 1970s, before being replaced by fantasy role playing games (RPGs) and computer games in the 1980s. In the 1990s computer wargames were covered in glitz, simplified and made into a mass market product. Many of the 70s era grognards don't recognize these games as wargames, but they are. And simple, glitzy wargames are the future. Not entirely, of course, there is also developing a via web based market for lower budget, but more accurate and detailed historical wargames. We'll never get back to the 70s, but with wargames established as a permanent part of the commercial gaming landscape, we can expect an unending stream of new and innovative ideas.&quot;<br/><br/>The first edition was published in 1980 by William Morrow.

        "description": "Includes expansion modules 12 - 17.<br/><br/>6 new expansion modules: The Ladies, The Catacombs, The Pews, The Dome, The Black Market, and The Guild Helps.<br/><br/>Module 12: The Ladies<br/>In this module, players receive an extra player board that allows for special actions. Two tiles can be switched in the market, a fresco tile can be reserved in the Cathedral, more coins can be earned in the studio, colors can be exchanged in the workshop, and in the Theater the mood can be lifted even further.<br/><br/>Module 13: The Catacombs<br/>This module changes the Hostel, Cathedral, and the Planning phase. The catacomb tiles are first placed face down in the cathedral and the fresco tiles are placed on top of them. Players can now purchase cartographer tiles in the hostel, which show locations in the cathedral that have to be painted in order to gain access to the catacomb tiles below. A catacomb tile can be sold for coins or kept till the end of the game, in which case the bishop awards extra victory points to the players.<br/><br/>Module 14: The Pews<br/>This module changes the market action and the planning phase. The chapel board is placed next to the game board and every player takes six wooden planks and places them in front of their screen. New market tiles will allow the players to purchase these when they visit the market. In the planning phase players may place their assistants on the new action tiles to use their collected wood to build pews for the church and collect some extra points.<br/><br/>Module 15: The Dome<br/>The dome tiles are shuffled and placed on the nine central fresco spaces, before the fresco tiles are placed on top. When a player finishes a fresco tile, they take the dome tile underneath and places it in front of them. A dome tile shows  a combination of two colors that the player needs to gain the depicted victory points. However, these tiles can only be painted at the end of the game, after the fresco in the cathedral is finished. So good planning and timing will be needed in order to keep the necessary paint cubes to finish the dome at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Module 16: The Black Market<br/>A poor painter canʼt be faulted for succumbing to a tempting offer from the dubious merchants of the black market. Their paints, stored in large barrels, are not expensive, but you never know which paint you will get...<br/>When you visit a market booth to buy paints, you may assign one of your apprentices to visit the Black Market instead. For this apprentice, a paint tile will be pulled at random from the draw bag, and the player must purchase this paint if possible. Since tiles are returned to the bag when a player visits a market booth or closes one down, players earlier in turn order will have a better guess what they might receive from the Black Market.<br/><br/>Module 17: The Guild Helps<br/>Painters often are missing urgently needed supplies for their work, but thankfully the members of the Painters Guild stick together and are willing to exchange among themselves. A lucky painter may find what they need at the guild.<br/>Each round one random basic paint and one random blended paint are placed on the guild tile. Using one of the two actions received for sending an apprentice to blend paints, the player may exchange one of their paints for the same type of paint from the guild tile (basic for basic and blended for blended). A player may now make two exchanges, two blends, or do one of each.<br/><br/>",

The police of Brook City will have to play a dangerous game of cat and mouse to decipher the killer's clues and save its citizens.

Can you save the city, or will you be the killer's next victim?<br/><br/>Components: 1 cop miniature, 1 suspect miniature, 12 crew miniatures, 82 cards (25 cop cards, 22 criminal cards, 21 case cards)<br/><br/>",
