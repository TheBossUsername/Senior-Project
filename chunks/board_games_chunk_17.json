Each has a separate colored unit box for ease of identification. The Allies are controlled by the game system. As the player, your objective is to drive as far as possible, cutting off the Allied armies in Belgium and possibly preventing the Dunkirk evacuation, thereby gaining a great victory for yourself.<br/><br/>As your forces drive across the map, they will encounter various Allied Forces, represented by face down Fog of War and Allied Formation counters. When encountering an Allied Formation, play temporarily stops in order to resolve the Combat Sequence, with the game system generating forces that your own forces will have to defeat.<br/><br/>",

The 3 different elements complete a life cycle; fire takes tree, tree takes water, and water takes fire; the elements create a comfy state of equilibrium.  Thing is, each game piece is actually a two faced deceiving character since game pieces can be flipped to reveal a different element on their other side known only to their master.<br/>These elements are potential carriers of your wand, which is the real star of the game.<br/><br/>Be the first player to advance the wand to the other side of the board &ndash; and you become an Elemaster, a winner of the game.<br/><br/>The game is portable, and all game parts are made of wood with top quality prints (silkscreened).<br/><br/>",

You are one of the city builders of Lemuria, and you must fight for control of the altar, sometimes cooperating with others and using your resources to further develop the ancient city &mdash; and you have only one year in which to do it.<br/><br/>Lemuria &mdash; originally released as 星刻のレムリア, or &quot;The Star Kingdom Lemuria&quot; &mdash; is at its heart a worker placement, resource management, and area control game. Players try to get points chiefly by converting two types of workers into resources, then using those resources to buy buildings. Points can also be gained by using special cards and by combining them with buildings.<br/><br/>The game simulates one full year in Lemuria's lifespan, with each of the twelve rounds representing one month, and with harvests on rounds 4, 8, and 12. On their turn, a player must either (1) place workers to &quot;seed&quot; their materia, or (2) harvest resources as a result of prior placements. Players may also choose to use accumulated resources to buy buildings, use accumulated food to &quot;employ citizens&quot; (use special cards), or spend gold to perform extra actions. Citizens can reside in buildings, which gives extra points during the harvests.<br/><br/>",

He uses his resources to complete 3 masterpieces before the end of the 10th season and leave his signature to future generations.<br/><br/>On a worker placement mechanic, Neanderthal moves, hunts, collects or attacks tribes. He uses his resources to found 7 tribes before the end of the 10th season and thus fight against his inevitable extinction.<br/><br/>On a hand management mechanic, Mother Nature places the resources and watches over her herds. She chooses the climatic conditions of each season, uses her cards to react to the actions of the tribes and trigger events.

        "description": "Publisher's blurb:<br/><br/>As 1941 moved from winter into spring, and then into summer, it was becoming increasingly apparent that war was coming to the United States. Most American political and military leaders viewed the Nazi war machine in Europe as the most menacing of all, and fear that US intervention/involvement may come too late grew with each passing month. Most who viewed the escalating conflict in Asia felt that diplomacy and economic sanctions could bring Japanese aggression on that continent to an end, and even if military force was needed, US and western military prowess would make short work of the armed forces from the empire of the Rising Sun. The sudden and devastating attack at Pearl Harbor on December 7th, the devastating air raids in the Philippines the next day, as well as the loss of Great Britain's battleships Repulse and Price of Wales brought the war home in a shocking and horrifying manner.<br/><br/>Despite the pre-war warnings and plans only in the Pacific, the Phillipines, and China there were Americans ready and able to fight the Axis forces. Of those, only a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew who were desperately outnumbered, led by man who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, met with success in the opening weeks of the war.<br/><br/>Chennault's First Fight appears in Against the Odds Magazine #12, by designer Paul Rohrbaugh. Chennault's First Fight covers the Pacific War's opening, when a small group of American mercenary airmen and ground crew, desperately outnumbered and led by a man (Claire Chennault) who had been vilified and disdained while in the US Army Air Force, found their operations repeatedly crowned with success.<br/><br/>Chennault's First Fight covers the first weeks of war in Burma, from mid-December 1941 to the Fall of Rangoon in early March 1942. The focus of the game is on the aerial battles, but the ground campaign is also covered, albeit on a simpler level.<br/><br/>Air units represent groups of 6 to 8 aircraft, while ground units are mostly brigades and regiments. The area map stretches from the Indian Frontier to French Indochina and from the Himalayas to south of Rangoon. An interactive turn sequence keeps both players hopping. There are two levels of air combat resolution, basic and advanced. The basic level has up to 3 rounds of air combat that are resolved on a &quot;battle board&quot; that also uses area movement. The advanced combat resolution system uses a hex map with more turns, very similar to the classic AH game Richtofen's War.<br/><br/>Air units are differentiated by type. Besides the P-40s flown by the Flying Tigers the Allies take wing with Brewster Buffalos, Hawker Hurricanes, P-36s, SB-2s, and Bristol Blenheims. The Japanese fly Oscar and Nate fighters. The heavy lifting is done by Sally, Ann, and Lily bombers while Dinah recon planes (among the fastest and highest flying prop planes built) lead the way. The Japanese must stike hard and fast and avoid getting sucked into what for them was a side-show. Running up a butcher's bill, or calling in forces badly needed elsewhere in the Emperor's warplan can lead to a lose of face and worse. The Allied player has precious little to waste in this fight, and must make the most of his opponent's weaknesses and mistakes while minimizing his own.<br/><br/>Rules cover enhanced reinforcements for both sides, the Vichy, Aces, Amphibious Assaults, the possible intervention of the Japanese Kido Butai (Carrier Air Units) and weather. Plenty of carnage and mayhem!<br/><br/>",

The momentum of the dropped marble is transferred in up to eight (orthogonal and diagonal) directions through adjacent contiguous lines of marbles. The last marble at the end of each of these lines is pushed away one cell from the dropped marble. Some fall off the board and are returned to the owning players.<br/><br/>When a player has only one marble left in hand, he or she is required to announce the last marble. At which point, his opponent is forced to knock at least one of his other seven marbles off the board, otherwise the opponent would lose the game.<br/><br/>The first player to have all eight of his or her marbles on the board at the end of his or her turn wins the game.<br/><br/>For beginners and perpetual games the following rule applies to the standard 7 x 7 game.<br/> 30-Rounds Rule (Optional, recommended for beginners): If a game lasts for 30 rounds (60 player turns), play stops and the outcome is determined. If either player has a majority of marbles on the board that player wins, if not, the game ends in a draw. Players can use a spare token to keep track of rounds by using the outside edge of the board. Once around is 28 steps. Two more rounds and the game ends.<br/><br/>",

Then they move their martian a number of empty spaces forward on the score track equal to the number same-colour contiguous flowers that are connected to the one they've just planted forming a group, including that flower.<br/><br/>They can also perform one of the 5 special actions before planting a flower, but only once per game.

However, if any other player(s) point at the same card as you do, none of you get the fish!<br/><br/>The first player to score 6 points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tiku is a beautiful wooden version of an early Knizia design that first appeared in spielbox magazine in 1993. Played on a 6x6 board, each player has six pieces and fourteen stone markers. The pieces move in a straight line orthogonally like rooks in chess, but without any capturing. Instead, they leave a trail of stones behind. As you can't jump other pieces, you try to block your opponent from crossing your markers and, therefore, replacing them. The first player to place their last stone marker wins.<br/><br/>Deeper than it seems at first glance. While it is important to place as many stones on your turn as possible, sometimes it is more important to make moves which force your opponent to take back some of their already placed markers.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Battle for Olympus (basic version)<br/><br/><br/>",

Your heart rate slows and your breathing steadies as you realize you are in a hospital. You glance around, finding your room empty. You read your identifying armband to see a name you don't recognize. As your bare feet smack to the cold tile floor and you steady your wobbling body, you feel the foreign presence of absence. You are alone&hellip;<br/><br/>In Coma Ward, players are patients who have awoken in an abandoned, yet still functioning hospital with no memory and no idea of what is happening. Patients must search the hospital for clues and necessities. In their search, patients may find unspeakably terrifying things.<br/><br/>Each time you play, you explore an ever-changing hospital as you search for the clues to your identity and the cause of the environment's unsettling emptiness. Balance your ever worsening terror and neurosis while monitoring your health and physical attributes. Remember to stay close to those who awoke with you because the shadows of the empty hospital can destroy your already fragile psyche. Once all the clues have been discovered, the true horror begins. Players discover what is actually happening and find out who they can trust &mdash; if anyone &mdash; and how to win.<br/><br/>Each playing is a unique phenomenon that introduces diverse and dynamic rules. Coma Ward is a mature game with themes of violence, absolution, distrust, gore, and traumatic incidence. Player discretion is advised.<br/><br/>Coma Ward plays in two parts: <br/>  The Prologue:<br/><br/>Patients will move through the Hospital discovering new Tiles that represent rooms. Some Tiles will affect a Patient&rsquo;s Health or Terror. Other Tiles will impact the game in other unpredictable ways.<br/><br/>While they explore and search, Patients will discover items that will help them in their frantic search for answers. Items like Clothing and makeshift Weapons will defend you from unseen forces or even other hostile Patients. While Medicine and Food can restore your Health and Focus. Ultimately, Patients are searching for the horrific Clues to what has happened in this hospital. Once all of the Clues have been revealed, the true game objective unfolds&hellip;<br/><br/><br/>The Phenomenon:<br/><br/>Upon uncovering the final Clue, the Phenomenon is triggered. Players will then withdraw and open the specified sealed envelope from the box revealing its secret contents telling the story of what is happening and how to win the game.<br/><br/>Some Phenomenon are cooperative, with players racing to escape the hospital or defeat cruel forces. While other Phenomenon will pit players against each other in secret alliances or an all out fight for survival. <br/>Each Phenomenon can lead to multiple endings. So, even if Players reveal the same Phenomenon multiple times, they will always have a unique experience.<br/>Some Phenomenon are physical, real, threats inspired by classic horror tropes;  others explore metaphysical and psychological themes&hellip;<br/><br/>Are you ready to open your eyes and experience the phenomenal horror of Coma Ward?<br/><br/>",

That is, despite an enormous historical fidelity, Gladiator: Quest for the Rudis plays quickly and easily like the best modern board games. This is due in large part to the innovative card-based game play. There are no dice, and for the multi-player game, no books full of tables to consult, no other resource whatsoever to consult except for the cards themselves.<br/><br/>",

Players are building their game zone using Workers and Guardians. The game zone is a place where the Workers are gaining gold. Units in the player's game zone may be destroyed by other players. Guardians are used to protect Workers and allow them to collect more gold. Rogues are used to destroy other players units, steal their gold and their cards. A Merchant allows to trade gold for cards or action points. Traps are used to counter other players cards.<br/><br/>A player's turn has two phases: generation phase and action phase. During the generation phase a player receives 1 action point, 1 card and a certain amount of gold determined by his game zone units. During the action phase players are simply playing their cards. To play a card, players need to spend their action points. There are three types of card costs: two action points cost, one action points cost and free action points cards.<br/><br/>There is a board with numbers representing gold amount from 0 to 50 Each player puts his token on the board and changes its position when his gold amount is growing or decreasing.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player hits 50 (or more) gold on the board.<br/><br/>",

Take command of the included 120 highly detailed sculpted miniatures and battle to save the world, but be careful, players who fight by your side in one round may be at your throat in the next, because in V-Wars, the virus is always spreading.<br/><br/>V-Wars begins as a co-operative game, but shifts as players reveal themselves to be vampires or the virus takes hold in infected players and forces them to change sides mid-game.<br/><br/>In V-Wars, the vampires are trying to infiltrate the world's governments, taking over human cities while simultaneously attempting to sway public sympathy to recognize them as victims of a viral outbreak, not just cold-blooded killers. Meanwhile, the humans are trying to stem the vampire tide, fighting back against their covert attacks and outright rebellions.<br/><br/>The vampires win immediately when they've reached a balance of city control and public sympathy to a point where their Victory marker and Sympathy markers reach each other on the Vampire Victory track or, alternatively, engage in a holding action long enough to exhaust all Player cards. Humans win by placing six cities under Martial Law in different regions of the world or if the vampires' Sympathy tokens are reduced to zero on the Vampire Victory track.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hatflings! is a fun game in which each player takes control of a halfling team in the famous &quot;game of hats&quot; that takes place every year in the Spring Festival of Halftown.<br/><br/>To win the game of hats, each team has to exchange the hat of another team for their own hat while dancing, jumping and frolicking. The game board has squares for the halfling tiles who have a hat of their color (orange or purple). Whenever a tile is placed on the 6 x 6 square board, all the adjacent tiles of the opponent team must be flipped to show the other team's hat color. The game ends when no more halflings could enter the game zone, and the winning team is the one who has more hats of their color. Different kinds of halflings, such as the big bellied ones or the halfling on stilts have special actions.<br/><br/>Who will win the game of hats this year?<br/><br/>",

Players will attempt to offload their excess items, but they have to organize them first. Players will need to make space in their houses to clean and will have to offer up some of their items to the rest of the neighborhood while also taking items from other neighbors if those items will help them organize better. Try to empty your house of your clutter first so that you can be the first to relax in the warm Spring weather.<br/><br/>In this game, players try to shed all their cards first but must offer some of them in the process. Offered cards may be drawn or played by opponents. Players may not sort their hand of cards, so by offering cards to the table they can change the structure of their hand to be best able to play cards.<br/><br/>Once one player sheds all cards, players gain trash depending on how many cards they still have. The player with the lowest amount of trash wins the game after a certain number of trash has been scored.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

To do that, you'll need to play the right animal at the right time while anticipating what opponents will play, too.<br/><br/>Each player starts the game with a hand of sixteen cards: four each of elephant, dog, cat and mouse, with those cards valued 1-4. One card of each type starts in the center of the table. Each round, players choose one card from their hand, then reveal them simultaneously.<br/><br/>Which animals are chased away is determined through a &quot;rock/paper/scissors&quot; format, with dogs chasing away cats, cats chasing away mice, mice chasing away elephants, and elephants chasing away dogs. If you play the only dog, for example, you collect all cats on the table and all cats played that turn; if multiple people play dogs, the strongest valued dog wins; if players play dogs of the same value, then those are ignored and the next strongest dog wins. Any animals not collected stay on the table for the next round.<br/><br/>Once all the hand cards have been played, players tally the value of the animals they collected and whoever has the highest sum wins!<br/><br/>",

Travel to different locations, rescue citizens, defeat minions, and save the day!<br/><br/>Players: 1 - 100+<br/>Game Time: 20 minutes<br/>Items needed: 4 six-sided dice and your favorite token, meeple, miniature, or pawn to represent your superhero<br/><br/>Setup: Determine your Superhero power for this game. Roll 2 d6 for your choices for your superpower this game, choose one superpower (Reroll if necessary until there are two different numbers). Different players can choose a different superpower.<br/><br/>Name your superhero and draw their costume. Place your Superhero token in the middle circle as your starting place (this is the only time your token will be in the middle circle)<br/><br/>The game is played over 10 rounds simultaneously, with players trying to earn the most points (honor). All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, assigning however each player determines.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Each Round you will Roll 4 dice and then spend those 4 dice<br/><br/>- Roll 4 dice - Roll the 4 dice. Write the numbers in the top right corner on the current round&rsquo;s track. This is just used as a helpful reference.<br/><br/>- Spend dice to either &ldquo;Move&rdquo; or &ldquo;Help&rdquo; - each die can be used to either move your superhero or help people in your current location (by marking an X or a number).<br/><br/>Move - There are two ways to move. Move your superhero token to the location that matches the die, or use a die that matches your superhero&rsquo;s current location to move your superhero token to any location.<br/><br/>Help- Use a die to help in your current location, marking an X or writing a number (depending on the location).<br/><br/>Repeat this until 10 rounds have been completed.<br/><br/>Using your Superpower: You may use your superpower three times throughout a game. The three blank squares in the middle circle (under your superhero) are there to show how many superpower uses you have remaining. You may use your superpower at any time, even multiple times in a round. For each use, mark an X in the square.<br/><br/>Superpowers explained:<br/>1 - Shrink - Change any die to a 1<br/>2 - Teleport - Use a die to travel to any location<br/>3 - Ice - Decrease a die by one (Example: Change a 4 to a 3, or a 2 to a 1. 1&rsquo;s cannot be changed)<br/>4 - Fire - Increase a die by one (Example: Change a 3 to a 4, or a 1 to a 2. 6&rsquo;s cannot be changed)<br/>5 - Shapeshift - Change one die to the same number of another die rolled this round (You may not Shapeshift a Wild die)<br/>6 - Grow - Change any die to a 6<br/><br/>Using Wild Dice: When you unlock a wild die, circle it in the bottom section with all the Wild dice. You may at any time spend a wild die. A wild die is an additional die that is any number. When you use a wild die, mark an X over an unlocked wild die icon to show you have spent it. You can spend multiple wild dice in a round, and you can use wild dice immediately after gaining them. You may use wild dice for moving or helping.<br/><br/>Rescuing Bystander Meeples: <br/>When a Bystander Meeple rescue requirements are met, you circle a Bystander icon in the bottom section with all the Bystanders. At the end of the game, each rescued Bystander earns you 5 Honor.<br/><br/>Defeating Robot Minions:<br/>Each location has three Robot Minions that are causing trouble. You may spend any number die to defeat one of these minions, marking an X over it at the location, then marking an X over a Robot Minion in the corresponding section at the bottom. At the end of the game, each defeated Robot Minion earns you 1 Honor. (Robot Minions are a last resort at a location when you do not have any better options, so dice do not go to waste.)<br/><br/>Each Location Explained:<br/><br/>1 - City Hall - Mark an X for matching die (1, 2, or 3) in any order. When the 1, 2, and 3 are marked off diagonally, you earn a Wild die. When all locations are marked off (all 9 spaces), you rescue a Bystander. Earn 4 Honor for each row and/or column completed.<br/><br/>2 - Hospital - Same number pairs. You can use the same number for multiple pairs. You can start a new pair before completing others. You do not have to go in any order.<br/><br/>3 - Downtown - Same number for the entire run. It can be any number to start, but it must be the same number for the rest of the game. You must start at the bottom, then continue up. Rescue Bystander or gain a Wild Die when the corresponding box is filled in.<br/><br/>4 - Powerplant - Start on the leftmost square. You can start with any number. The next number must be exactly one higher or lower. It may not be the same number. (Example: You use a 5 die to help, writing a 5 in the leftmost square. The next number can either be a 4 or a 6. You use a 6 die to help, writing a 6 in the next square. The next number will have to be a 5, as there is nothing higher than a 6.)<br/><br/>5 - Warehouse -Start on the leftmost square. You can start with any number. The next number must be equal to or higher than the previous number. (Example: You use a 2 die to help, writing a 2 in the leftmost square. The next number can be a 2 or higher. You use a 4 die to help, writing a 4 in the next square. The next number can be a 4 or higher.)<br/><br/>6 - Church - Mark an X for matching die. You can mark off in any order. If you complete a complete column (1-6 or 6-1) you gain 15 Honor. If you complete the top six you earn a Wild Die, if you complete the bottom six you rescue a Bystander.<br/><br/>End of Game:<br/>After you have completed the 10th roll/round, total your Honor/points earned from each location, rescued bystander meeples (5 honor per), and defeated robot minions (1 honor per). The player with the most Honor is the winner!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Airships: North Pole Quest will take you back to 1924, in the golden years of airships, when nations started aiming for the Arctic, the last inviolate frontier, and for its symbol: the North Pole. Being the &quot;first&quot; was not only a matter of prestige, but also of great opportunities: strategic explorations, lands to be annexed, trade routes to be opened.<br/><br/>Beautiful (and highly detailed) airship models, plus abstracted navigational and flying tools, are the hands-on parts of the game, while cards and changing weather will continually deal players new challenges.<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of one country's airship commander, having to organize a crew and certain equipment choices, and then beginning a series tertiary flights for fund-raising and prestige. Each team will require a &quot;support ship&quot; and landing equipment, and these have to coordinate with flights as well, especially for the big jump to the North Pole.  Players select from a list of &quot;actions&quot; that they can take each turn and must judge which ones are the priority for this turn and what can wait.<br/><br/>The game is  not just &quot;Start at Point A and fly to North Pole.&quot; The tertiary expeditions, for fund-raising and publicity, allow players to better equip their &quot;team&quot; to make the longer journey, and to hire specialists for their crew members who have distinct abilities for extra support. Weather plays a key role and a clever device keeps the weather changing in realistic patterns. Players must factor the current weather and what is anticipated as they make choices of actions and routes. Airships can be damaged and this costs time and money to repair.<br/><br/>The campaign game ends-- as expected-- with one airship reaching the North Pole and returning to its support ship. (You have to get back to win!)<br/><br/>Shorter scenarios offer the chance to &quot;race&quot; to other locations and deal with different challenges. There is also a solo, &quot;training&quot; mission scenario to help players learn how to coordinate actions for the best performance.<br/><br/>",

His most notable characteristic was that he could change his shape at will, from a man to a fish, a whale, a bird, or anything else. This most useful skill against opponents gave rise to the expression of being in a &quot;Protean struggle.&quot; The Proteus game set is so named because the game can change its form &mdash; not its physical form, but rather the game rules themselves.&quot;<br/><br/>Michael's concept was to create a meta-game that allowed for rule-changing but had a fixed slate of  rules, unlike the fluid game of Nomic. The rules on 9 wood tiles determine how the players may move their pieces, trade the tiles, or even win. A rule is activated when a player's piece enters a correspondingly shaped tile, and the previously active rule is turned off. A placement phase precedes the movement stage. Experienced players can sometimes win even before movement begins. The strategy is intense because long-range moves are not calculable.

The players must strategically move and produce units in order to conquer the capital of the opposing player(s). There are only two kinds of units: military and civilian. Civilian units are used to produce new units; military units attack and defend.<br/><br/>The gameplay is very simple. On a turn, players may either produce new pieces or move their existing pieces. It is a game of planning the buildup to battle and putting ones forces in an advantageous position. It is not a game of doing battle and hoping to get lucky.<br/><br/>The length of the game depends on the number of players<br/><br/>2 players: 20-30 minutes<br/>3 players: 30-60 minutes<br/>4 players: 60-90 minutes<br/>6 players: 90-120 minutes<br/><br/>",

The Germans are attempting to clear this enemy bastion on the Black Sea and free up their forces for the great offensive to the north. The Russians are desperately trying to hold out as long as possible, falling back on great defensive terrain and strong fortified positions, hoping to delay the German invaders and extract as high a price as possible from them for the capture of Sevastopol.<br/><br/>But the Germans have prepared for this campaign. With complete air superiority, the Luftwaffe (German Air Force) relentlessly attacks from the skies, while special super-heavy siege artillery is slowly and carefully brought in and assembled expressly for this operation. It&rsquo;s a hard-fought matter of time, distance, and attrition as you recreate the Assault on Sevastopol.<br/><br/>Scale: Each unit is 1 regiment, brigade, division, or battle group, each hex is 3 kilometers, and each turn is 3 days.<br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/>     One 4-page, color instructions booklet<br/>     40 color, die-cut, two-sided 5/8&rdquo; mounted game pieces<br/>     One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; color game map with charts &amp; tables<br/>     One 2-page sheet of historical, designer, and developer notes<br/>     One 4-page, color BATTLESSON (TM) booklet<br/>     One bonus Optional Rule<br/><br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Assault on Sevastopol<br/><br/><br/> Buy Microbadge<br/><br/>",

On a turn a piece is moved to an adjacent empty space and a wooden die-holder is then put in the place just moved from. A die is then rolled and put in the holder. After the first 9 moves, each turn also has a second element. This is to remove an empty holder from the board or to roll a die and remove a die from the board with the same number (thus leaving an empty holder).

        "description": "In Atelier, from 2 to 5 players play the role of painters that are called to create wonderful pieces of art.<br/><br/>On their turn, players have to decide whether to draw 2 cards from the center or play cards on their display. If they decide to play cards, they will have to pay the cost by discarding other cards from hand or using the colors from the palette. The cards played have a double function: on one side they form players' personal palette, on the other side they score points at the end of the game as works of art.<br/><br/>An important feature of the game is that cards must be played in a certain order. First players have to play the white canvas, then the white canvas can be drawn with a &quot;drawing&quot; card, finally the drawing card can be completed placing a painting card on it.<br/><br/>The first player who completes a work becomes the original painter while all the other players who complete the same work subsequently are considered counterfeiters.<br/><br/>The game ends when there are a certain number of finished paintings. Players earn points according to the works created and lose points for the canvases left blank. In addition to the canvas points, players can achieve goals during the game that provide extra points. The player with the most points will be elected the most renowned artist!<br/><br/>",

Players use special square cards to represent the players they have in each of the positions: strikers, mid-fielders, defenders, and goalies.  Each turn, one of the two players will be the offense based on a simultaneous selection of cards from their respective play books.  Then players allocate their players to the current play, which rotates the used players.  A player card has a number of soccer balls on each edge, which tells how many skill points the player will contribute to a given play, and using the player (thusly rotating him) might actually weaken him for the next use.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    Tooor!<br/><br/><br/>",

Attack, raid, surround and defend in campaigns between the Greeks and the Trojans found in Homer&rsquo;s epic tale &ldquo;The Iliad.&rdquo;<br/><br/>In ILIOS: Battle for Troy, 2 to 4 players take turns deploying warrior tiles with white rays representing spears and swords and their directions of attack.  When a player raids a warrior tile, they place a disk of their color to occupy it.  Warrior tiles are occupied by different players throughout the game until a tile is completely surrounded.  It is then removed from the board, and added to the plunder of the player occupying it. Multiple tiles may be surrounded on one play, and surrounded tiles may be occupied by other players. This means your opponents can plunder on your turn!<br/><br/>Troy Expansion<br/><br/>The climax of the battles of Troy was the capture of the fortified city of Troy, which was only taken with the Trojan horse.

        "description": "Toscana has simple rules.  Both players have 16 tiles (which are divided into 8 squares in a 2x4 grid).  The squares show either red roofs or gray plazas.  One set, used by the 'roof' player, has roofs on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.  The other set, used by the 'plaza' player, has plazas on 6 of the 8 squares on each tile.  Each player shuffles their stack of tiles and places them FACE UP before them.  (Thus you can see what your opponent's next tile will be.)  The tiles will be placed onto a 17x17 board.<br/><br/>Players alternate placing tiles onto the board with a few placement restrictions:<br/><br/>1) The first tile must cover the center square of the board.<br/><br/>2) Later tiles must be placed so that at least one square of the player's color touches a square of the player's color on a previously placed tile.<br/><br/>The object is to form as large area of connected roofs or plazas as possible by the end of the game.  Each tile you have in this connection scores one point.  There are little 'tiddly wink' markers to aid in this counting process.  Each player tallies the tiles in their largest connected group, and the player with the greatest total wins.  The rules call for two games, with players alternating sides in the two games.<br/><br/>The only other feature of the game is the veto.  Each player has the opportunity to 'veto' an opponent's tile ONCE per game.  A chip is simply placed atop the tile atop your opponent's stack to indicate that you are 'vetoing' that tile. The tile is placed on the bottom of his stack and will likely never rise to the top during the game.<br/><br/>The game is VERY easy to learn and plays quickly... 20 to 30 minutes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "La Guerre de l'Empereur: The Emperor's War, 1805-1815 is a game of maneuver and battle between the forces under Napoleon Bonaparte and six other nations that both opposed and supported him at various times in the years between 1805 and 1815. Players vie for dominance of early 19th Century Europe. As the French player, you'll set Napoleon and his armies upon a continent whose differing political statures plays right into your hands. The greatest army in Europe is at your hands...<br/><br/>Divide and conquer! As the British player, you'll utilize diplomacy, clever event play, a powerhouse economy and the greatest navy in the world to become the dominant nation. As Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain or the Ottoman Empire, you must strike a balance between expansionist aggression and diplomatic harmony among your neighbors. Indeed, a nation must expand to triumph. However the means chosen to that end will largely decide the level of success. Play  the part of being everyone's friend and your nation will likely live in relative safety...and lose the game miserably. Play the part of the blind aggressor and you'll likely go down faster than the peace broker. Striking a balance is critical.<br/><br/>The game map covers the territories from Scandinavia in the north to the Mediterranean and North Africa in the south, and from deep Russia in the east to Portugal and the Atlantic in the west. Movement is by areas (provinces) on land, and sea zones at sea. On land, the units of maneuver are (roughly) corps, while at sea each unit represents a naval squadron. When opposing land armies meet for battle, corps are broken down into divisions (loosely) and deployed on a eight zone battle map for combat resolution. The dice-less combat engine uses a system of battle options which are played and cross-referenced for resolution of actual casualties and morale loss. The number of battle options distributed, along with the initial army morale of the opposing sides, is determined by army size, nationality and leaders present. The battle options are of offensive and defensive nature. The offensive options cover standard maneuvers such as &quot;Flank Attack&quot;, &quot;Cavalry Charge&quot; and &quot;Assault&quot;, while the defensive options are things such as &quot;Refuse Flanks&quot;, &quot;Squares Formed&quot; and &quot;Reverse Slopes&quot;.<br/><br/>The rules are relatively simple and fast moving, even though a host of subtleties and complexities of the Napoleonic period are represented within the game system. The means by which this relative simplicity was achieved was (largely) through the use of self-explanatory strategic event charts. Be warned: This game is easy to understand and play, but very difficult to master.<br/><br/>The game system works the same whether you're playing with two players or seven. With multiple players, you'll need all of your diplomacy skills to enlist aid in achieving your goals. With fewer players, the event charts will handle the bulk of the diplomatic duties. Regardless of how many players you have, all seven major powers will actively participate to a greater or lesser degree.<br/><br/>",

They have to be skilled, fearless and experienced. But racing is mostly a true team sport. Hundreds of engineers, designers and mechanics work together to find the optimal Race Pace. The person responsible to lead the team to victory is the Team Manager, and that is you!<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>As the Team Manager of a race team, your goal is to make sure your driver is the first to cross the finish line! Before you start the game, you select a circuit and each player selects a team, a driver and a tyre compound to start on. Set up the board and turn the first weather card.<br/><br/>The Race Pace (hereafter: RP) is the number of laps that your car can make in a game round. Your RP depends on a number of factors. But basically, the gameplay comes down to selecting an action in each game round and thereby gradually improving your RP (upgrade the car, coach the driver, charge or use the boost system, take defensive actions or make use of strategic opportunities). At the end of your turn, count the RP that your car can make and move your car across the track. But keep an eye on your tyre conditions and race situations that occur at the start of the game round, because they can limit your race pace.<br/><br/>Each game round consist of 3 phases<br/><br/>1.

During the race, situations will occur that can change the course of the game. From your radio control centre at the pit wall, you anticipate or react to these situations: select the right tyres, improve the car set up, coach the driver, order a pit stop, to use the Boost system, etcetera. With each lap your car and driver will improve, increasing the Race Pace. But so does the competition.<br/><br/>Do you have the best strategy to win the race?<br/><br/>Team Mode<br/>Race Pace has an alternative gameplay variant: the Team Mode. In Team Mode, each player manages one team with two drivers, or two players can team up with two different drivers for the same team! The gameplay changes in a way that you can now help each other (or your team mate). However, winning the game in Team Mode is also a team effort, so sacrificing one driver for the race win of the other is not sufficient. This gives the Team Mode a new dimension to the race strategies.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>Each player will take the role of the operational theater commander. You still have leaders with short names and shorter tempers looking over your shoulder and telling you want to do (handled in game terms with directives and procedures that turn your decision making choices as much into &quot;How do I please him?&quot; as &quot;How do I beat the enemy?&quot;) Counters represent mostly Soviet armies and German corps, with &quot;assets&quot; that can be attached to both, and minor Axis allies represented as well. Map scale is 55km to the hex, with 2 turns per month.<br/><br/>The Battle of Stalingrad manages to provide monster game nuances in a game small in size with innovative design. For example, the sequence of play is not the same for each side. And why should it be? The Axis and Soviet armies do not do the same tasks each turn, because their armies operated differently.<br/><br/>The Soviet player actually allocates supplies as he sees fit. Does he reward success or try to stave off defeat? Both players use Tactical and Strategic movement, as they move their forces around the battlefield. German Primary and Secondary objectives are determined randomly (and hidden from the Soviets!). Side operations in the Caucasus offer additional victory points but occupy units to achieve them. Are the points worth the cost?<br/><br/>Operation Uranus, the great Soviet counteroffensive, has optional start times, with incentives for delay (if the rest of the Soviet front can hold out!).<br/><br/>Sudden death victory is possible for both sides, encouraging that extra effort that could win it all...or leave one exposed and exhausted. At the end of the game, key point adjustments and multipliers get factored in and compared. Short of the Sudden Death victory, which side really &quot;wins&quot; can be in doubt to the very end.<br/><br/>As it should be, in a situation like this.<br/><br/>Part of the TPS, &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series<br/>That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value. With shifting objectives and variable entry times for key units, no two Stalingrad games will play the same.<br/><br/>",

The battle was fought from October 23-26 1944 as the US returned to the Philippines, landing on the island of Leyte. The US Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy fought a series of actions that collectively have been recorded as the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The historical result was a decisive defeat of the Imperial Navy, virtually eliminating it as a viable force for the remainder of the war. For the US Navy, it was a victory that was almost squandered due to command problems.<br/><br/>Each game turn is six hours; there are three day turns and one night turn for each calendar day. Each sea hex is approximately 25 nautical miles across. The game map is used for all Task Force movement and movement by air units. Two tactical displays are included, one for naval surface engagements and one for air attacks.<br/><br/>",

In the middle of the forest is the Magic Mountain where Morley the Wizard lives.  The first player to reach Morley's castle wins.<br/><br/>Players are dealt a hand of three cards.  Cards show a monster type and a number.  They are used to move your elf ahead on the path or to challenge another player to a duel.  Playing the right color cards at certain points on the board allows a player to take shortcuts.<br/><br/>Red spots on the board are ambush spaces.  Players landing there must play a card face-up from their hand and then draw the top card off the deck.  If the player's card is higher than the drawn card, they move forward the number of spaces equal to their card's number.  If their card is lower than the drawn card, they move backwards the number of spaces equal to the drawn card's number.<br/><br/>Duels are handled the same way, only they are between players and the winner gets to move to the space in front of the losing player (assuming it is forward movement along the path).  In this way players are never really out of the running because they can challenge the leader anytime they draw a strong card.<br/><br/>",

It recreates on the tabletop the tension and excitement of modern action-thrillers such as the Bond and Bourne films, The Unit or Burn Notice TV shows, and the Splinter Cell and Modern Warfare series of video games.<br/><br/>The fast-play rules use regular 6-sided dice and a card-driven activation system to keep all players in the thick of the action, while the mission generator provides a wide range of options for scenarios, from stealthy extraction or surveillance missions to more overt raids or assassinations.<br/><br/>Stealth, combat and technical expertise all have a role to play, and players may select from a number of different character types &ndash; spies, mercenaries, criminals, hackers, special forces and many more &ndash; to recruit the best possible team for the job.<br/><br/>Players may also choose to join a faction &ndash; powerful organizations, intelligence agencies, criminal syndicates, militaries or rebel groups, each with a stake in international affairs. By doing so, their team may receive certain benefits, but may also find itself limited at a crucial time. With the variety offered by the characters, factions and scenarios, no two games of Black Ops should ever be the same!<br/><br/>Although the standard Black Ops setting is an ultra-modern world just a hair removed from our own, the rules are versatile and adaptable enough to suit OSS operations behind Nazi lines, Cold War-era infiltration missions in Moscow or Berlin, or sabotage runs against a rival corporation&rsquo;s interests in a cyberpunk dystopia, and the rulebook will include a guide to running games in such settings.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Game description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Gunship: First Strike! is Escape Pod Games' core release in a planned series of tactical space combat games. Players fight to win battles in a futuristic civil war with a variety of ship types. From the agile and speedy Fighters, to lethal Gunships and intimidating Capital Ships, every battle is a well-balanced slugfest that comes right down to the wire. Our new Trinity Mechanic uses boards, cards and dice together in an extremely innovative and easy-to-learn system that lets new players jump right in.<br/><br/>What makes the Gunship series unique are the numerous combinations of ships that the players &quot;build&quot; at the start of each battle. By choosing from an ever-growing selection (through expansions) of available Weapons and Upgrades, players are able to create a custom Gunship that is suited to their particular style of play or battle situation. Some guys are &quot;defensive&quot; minded; they'll choose Heavy Armor, +1 Shield Generators and 4 Blaster Cannons to fend off the enemy Gunship. But another player might prefer to build a &quot;Carrier Killer&quot; complete with wings full of Bombs and an Autoblaster Cannon to shred his way through the enemy Fighter Squadron. While most of the Upgrade cards are geared toward the Gunships (the true star of the show) you can also do some great things to your Fighters and Capital Ships. New kinds of ships will come with every expansion to further add to the possibilities. No two battles are ever the same!<br/><br/>In Gunship: First Strike!, the civil war has just started. Your orders are simple: Command a task force of one Assault Carrier and its Gunship and Fighters on a mission to destroy the enemy's Carrier. Guess what? He has the very same orders! Dogfights will ensue, Torpedoes will strike home and Thruster Bombs are going to pound the Capital Ships mercilessly. If your Gunship takes too much damage for comfort, or if the battle situation changes and you want a different weapon load, land inside your Carrier for a quick &quot;pit stop&quot;. Make sure that you defend it with all your might because once your Carrier is gone, the only option left to you is to flee the battlespace and hope to take revenge another day.<br/><br/>As the Gunship universe grows, players will be able to fight bigger and bigger battles. Soon the objectives will include breaking through the enemy picket line to drop troops on the planet below. The Gunships will be called upon to not only assault other ships, but also to go dirtside and give air support to the land battle raging below  A free Campaign System is planned where players can keep track of a fleet of ships and territories. Lose your Carrier in today's battle and you might lose a critical Outpost next week.

The real speaker knows how to charm the audience with the greatest dilemma, predicting the opinions thanks to a supernatural intuition... or a more practical cheating technique!<br/><br/>In Ostrakon, you take the role of a Greek philosopher, posing questions on assigned topics with only 2 answers. The other players decide which of the two answers suits them, and the philosopher secretly votes with the side he thinks will outnumber the other. If he is correct, he scores points equal to the number of players who voted against his choice. If he is incorrect, he scores nothing. So its best to pick questions with roughly equally viable answers.<br/><br/>",

Players earn fame by recruiting the town's citizens to complete tasks, construct new buildings, and hunt tentacles!<br/><br/>You and the other players take turns recruiting citizens to build the town, all while defending your new home from the tentacle threat. New citizens can complete a task or build a building for you. The more buildings you have in a district, the more profitable some tasks become &mdash; AND the player with the most buildings in each district earns extra fame when the game ends.<br/><br/>Tentacle Town is divided into three districts: the market, the foundry, and the docks. Each district has its own tasks to be completed, from forging harpoons in the foundry to butchering food at the docks. The rewards for some tasks get better when there are more citizens are in the district, which means the new citizen you just recruited will benefit the other players, too! Likewise, the rewards for some tasks improve when there are more buildings to the district &mdash; but for these tasks, only you benefit from your own buildings. You may also pay the citizens of Tentacle Town overtime to complete additional tasks, assuming you have coins to spend.<br/><br/>At the end of a player's turn, they roll the danger die to see if the tentacles attack, stay quiet, or if more tentacles emerge from the depths. The more citizens in a district, the more likely the tentacles are to attack! When tentacles attack, they may destroy buildings, kill citizens, or cause the workers to flee to a safer district! This is your chance to be a hero and defend the district, provided you have some harpoons handy! Defeat a tentacle, and you'll not only earn a bit of fame and haul in some fresh calamari, too!<br/><br/>When the influx of new citizens runs out, the game is over and the person with the most fame becomes the mayor of Tentacle Town and wins the game!<br/><br/>",

The settlers of the Slavic tribes are moving south from the northern forests and swamps. They will soon inhabit Eastern Europe and the Balkans.<br/><br/>Three young states have emerged: the Bulgarian Khanate, the Khazar Khaganate and Kievan Rus. They will struggle against each other and against the powerful Eastern Roman Empire for the right to exist and dominate the region.<br/><br/>Ruthenia is a classic two-level historical strategy game set in Eastern Europe in the 8th to 10th centuries.<br/><br/>You lead one of four states building fortresses, markets and temples, using fleets to trade, rob and transport troops, conquering new territories, commanding armies and conducting high politics.<br/><br/>In each battle, you lead your army personally. Cards are used to represent the soldiers lined up in medieval combat. Your army has four basic troop types &ndash; line infantry, heavy infantry, light cavalry and heavy cavalry &ndash; as well as support troops such as archers, garrisons and sailors. You can enhance the performance of your forces through the play of military action cards.<br/><br/>Rules govern the movement of non-player factions, including tribes and hordes as well as the states not taken by players.<br/><br/>Ruthenia includes: 1 Game Board (46.5 x 52.5 cm), 20 Army Counters, 228 Round Cardboard Tokens, 296 Cards, 4 Dice, 5 Summary Sheets, a Strategy Book and a Battle Book.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Race to the Sea 1914&quot; is the feature magazine wargame included in Yaah! #8 by Flying Pig Games.<br/><br/>After the Battle of the Marne was won by the Allied armies in early September 1914, the Germans withdrew  to a formidable position north of the Aisne River and entrenched themselves on the high ground. Numerous French efforts to dislodge them failed and the two great hosts stared at each other from their respective trenches. German General Erich von Falkenhayn and French Marshal Joseph Joffre realized that there was much open, exploitable territory to the north of these solidified lines and each prepared to maneuver around the flanks of his opponent. These mutual and simultaneous flanking moves resulted in a series of headlong battles that gradually shifted the forces north toward the French Channel coast. These maneuverings yielded a series of encounter battles at Picardy, Albert, Artois, La Bassee and along the Yser River. But these engagements were ultimately indecisive and the campaign&rsquo;s final stage was set for the dramatic clash at the end of the &ldquo;race&rdquo;, at the ancient textile city of Ypres. <br/>The &ldquo;Race to the Sea&rdquo; campaign was the last mobile campaign on the western front of the First World War &ndash; a last chance for victory. It was a final push to get &ldquo;home before the leaves fall&rdquo;. But the resulting murderous battles &ndash; culminating in the infamous &ldquo;Kindermord von Ypern&rdquo; (the Massacre of the Innocents at Ypres) &ndash; were so bloody and indecisive that their effects instead directly lead to the creation of the Western Front trench lines and to a continuation of a  war that seemed would never end.<br/><br/>The game system is based on the same system used in the game Dead Reckoning by Tiny Battle Publishing. There are no dice, no CRT's, no lists of modifiers and no combat factors. A card-based combat resolution and initiative bidding system drives the action, along with a random event table that provides variety, WWI theme and campaign-specific events.<br/><br/>The game includes:<br/><br/>One 12&quot; x 18&quot; map<br/>88 counters<br/>36 cards (12 Initiative and 24 Combat Results)<br/><br/>",

Based on the science fiction movies of the 1950s, especially They Came From Outer Space, the cover also shows three well-developed women in pedal-pushers, pumps, and low-cut blouses caught in the clutches of tentacled creatures with large eyes and crunching mouth parts.<br/><br/>Two scenarios from 1951 are included. In one, the Bug-Eyed Monsters land in Freedom, New Hampshire to capture women, who have Pulchritude ratings from 1 to 6, and to knock out the men. Combat is resolved using ratings such as strength, weapons, and aiming ability. The human (and family dog) counters feature different abilities such as alerting others. In the second scenario, the aliens attempt to kidnap President-elect Eisenhower.<br/><br/>Components:  23&quot;x17&quot; color map, die-cut counters, 8-page rulebook and two six-sided dice in a box.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Matthew Costello in Space Gamer no. 68.<br/><br/>",

Six islands are placed randomly around the main island of Port Royale to create a unique, table filling play area.  The ships are large cardboard/plastic stand-ups with spaces for up to 8 counters in the base.  The 12 prize cards are distributed around the islands, each player needs to find the three specific prizes listed on their captain's character card to win the game.<br/><br/>Players roll dice and use the included movement caliper to move from island to island where they can collect prizes or add new crew members to give bonuses to their ship.  The players use the map card deck to gain prizes or gold from the islands. If they get another player's prize, they can either sell it at Port Royale, or keep it and use its special ability for themselves.  Beware though, the other player can attack and attempt to steal their prize back.<br/><br/>There is additionally a Captain's deck of cards that can earn many rewards, or cause much grief for the other captains, including letting loose the dreaded Kracken.  Finally some islands will allow you to hire new crewmembers to add to your ship, such as a gunner or sailor.  These can add either 1, 2, or 3 to your movement or fight rolls depending upon their level.<br/><br/>This thematic game includes simple, full color rules and high quality components.

The player cards have the odds of events that happen during the course of the game.  The dice are used to determine the outcomes of events according to odds on the cards of the players involved.  For example, in baseball, a plate appearance involves a pitcher and batter and the outcome determined by the dice can range from an out to a home run.  The game can be played head to head or solo.  Games can be simulated or even entire seasons.<br/><br/>The game contains 42 cards that represent various Major League Baseball players during the peak of their careers. Players must use their managing abilities to gain an edge in a game that uses cards to represent both pitcher and batter, charts to represent fielders, and dice to represent the bat and pitches.<br/><br/>Baseball express is a slimmed down version of Strat-o-matic Baseball (both in play and size).

Sake flows freely, but not even the cellars of Bishamon, the God of War, could quench the thirst of Japan's greatest swordsmen. Servants run for cover, knowing full well where all this is going. Suddenly an eerie silence fills the common room. On the table, only one full cup remains. Who will get the last drink? Will it be the elder of the group, or shall the greatest warrior have it? Time seems to stretch to infinity, until one hand makes a move toward the cup. Such insolence! This insult shall not be tolerated! The elder goes for his sword...<br/><br/>We shall never know whether the bold samurai was taking the cup for himself or only to hand it to his venerable companion. It does not matter: all warriors take offense and draw their katanas, joining the fight at the call of &quot;SAAKEEE!&quot;<br/><br/>In Sake &amp; Samurai you are a fierce and thirsty samurai warrior, willing to do anything to get the last cup of Sake. The winner is the most drunk samurai &ndash; in game terms, the player who has collected the most Sake drink counters &ndash; at the end of the Sudden Death round.<br/><br/>Be wary, though, for drinking too much will dull your wits and mastery with the sword. Each drink of Sake prevents you from using one of your resources, be it a weapon, an item, or even your personal skill! You must always be wary not to drink too much or you risk becoming a defenseless sot in the hands of your enemies. On the other hand, you will be able to burn up some of the Sake you have drunk to obtain significant bonuses which may well save your life. Show yourself as the wise warrior you are and balance your strategy with care, not burning up too much Sake, thus finding yourself in the rear at the end of the game, when the Masu is empty and the Sudden death round begins. Those who will succumb to their enemies' blows won't be eliminated from the game, but will become Spirits of Enma, the thirsty god of death, and team up with the other Spirits to attack the living, aiming to steal their Sake. Raise your glasses (and your katanas)!<br/><br/>Sake &amp; Samurai is a board game for 3-8 Players about honor, blood and Sake. It is both a standalone game and an expansion for Beer &amp; Vikings..<br/><br/>Integrates with:<br/><br/>    Beer & Vikings<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a trick-taking playing card game played using 22 cards.<br/>The game is similar in mechanism to Oh Hell, but simpler to grasp because there is no suit.<br/>It is usually played using a tarot deck, keeping only the 21 trumps and the fool.<br/>If a tarot deck is not available, then it can be played using two suits (one suit for values 1 to 10, the other one for values 11 to 21) and the fool.<br/><br/>Summary of the rules:<br/><br/>If played in partnerships, partners sit across the table from each other.<br/><br/>Players begin the game with 14 points. The game ends when one player reaches 0. The player scoring the most points wins.<br/><br/>The dealer deals the cards so that the lowest number of cards remains undealt: for example with four players, five cards are dealt to each player and two cards are put aside.<br/><br/>The player to his left announces how many tricks he thinks he will win, then the player on his left, etc... This is the contract. The dealer is the last to announce, but the sum of announced tricks must not equal the number of cards dealt to each player.<br/><br/>Let us follow the same example, where 5 cards were dealt to each player: player A announces 2 tricks, players B and C each announce 1 trick. Then the dealer cannot announce 1 trick because the total would be 5 tricks and each player could fulfill his contract. The player to the left of the dealer starts. The winner of a trick is the one who will start the next trick. The owner of the fool must assign its value (0 or 22) when he plays it.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each player counts the number of tricks he has won and compare it to the number of tricks he has announced. No point is awarded for fulfilling the contract, but 1 point is deducted for each missed trick, either over or under the number of tricks the player initially announced.<br/><br/>The next round takes place in the same way, but with one less card per player.<br/><br/>After several rounds where one less card is dealt in each round, there is a round where each player only receives one card. Each player then places the card on its forehead without looking at it, so that all players except him can see the card. Each player then announces if he will win the trick or not. As was the case in previous rounds, the sum of announced tricks cannot equal the number of cards dealt to each player (i.e. one).<br/><br/>After this round, in each round the number of cards dealt to each player is increased by one, until the number of cards is the same as in the first round.<br/>If we follow the same example as above (with 4 players), here are the numbers of cards dealt to each player in each round: 5-4-3-2-1-2-3-4-5-4-3...<br/><br/>",

Thus, the game works only with 4 OR 6 players, not 5.<br/><br/>Before the game starts, each team of two players secretly agrees on a signal &mdash; a wink, a gesture, a word, whatever &mdash; they will use in the game. This signal should be clear enough for the partner, but not something that can be identified by other players.<br/><br/>Now the actual game starts, with partners sitting opposite one another. All players simultaneously exchange cards in hand with cards on the table. As soon as any player has managed to collect four of a kind, that player tries to let their partner know by giving that team's secret signal. If the team partner identifies the wink, the nudge, the code word, whatever, that team can score points. However, a vigilant opponent might just be faster and counter in time by announcing that this particular team has sent the signal. The opponent does not have to tell the group the signal. Special cards spice up the whole procedure.<br/><br/>G&auml;msh Alpin is a further development of a public domain game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cartooner is a new experience in drawing games, a game that combines storytelling and drawing. It is like Once Upon a Time plus Pictionary, with story prompts that are inspired by popular and quirky comics themes and trends. While this is a game about drawing, it's not a game in which the best artist wins as your strategy and ability to adapt quickly matters much more. Points are awarded for strategy and following the rules, not artistic ability. However, if you are an artist, it is undeniable that Cartooner can be a great companion for you as well. A solo mode has been designed just for that.<br/><br/>The game plays out in four rounds that build up in intensity, and each round is five minutes long. Your goal is to get the most fame points at each round using a combination of your theme cards and the fleeting market trends that are valid only for one round. In the end, the player with the most fame wins&hellip;but every player walks away with a comic of their own creation.<br/><br/>Start by drawing three theme cards at random to determine what your comic will be about. Will your comic involve Dinosaurs, Secret Hideouts and Car Chases? Werewolves, Obnoxious Coworkers and The Desire to Be Famous? Or Pirates, Blobs and The Last Human on Earth? When time is up, follow these simple rules to score the game:<br/><br/><br/>    Rule 1: You get 1 Fame point for each Theme you express in your comic in a way the other players can recognize by drawing it or writing it in a word balloon. <br/>    Rule 2: You get 2 Fame for drawing something in every Panel, no matter how simple. <br/>    Rule 3: You get 2 more Fame for keeping it succinct by using three or fewer Word Balloons on the page. It's that easy.<br/><br/><br/>Rounds two through four introduce an element of strategy: Trend Cards. Each Trend Card gives you new ways to earn Fame points for that round. Unlike Themes, which are personal, Trend Cards represent the market and affect every player in the game. Your fickle readers may want you to inject Superheroes, Funny Animals, Medical drama, Disaster stories, Mystery,  Romance, or any one of 52 Trends into your story. It's every artist's dilemma: stick to your original story, or sell out for Fame?<br/><br/>Each round brings more Panels to draw and Trends to chase. Plus, each round has more Fame in play than the round before, so the outcome is up in the air until the very end.<br/><br/>When the final round ends, the winner is the one with the most Fame Tokens, but every player ends the game with their own comic.<br/><br/>With literally hundreds of thousands of possible combinations of story prompts, you'll never run out of ideas.<br/><br/>",

They failed to take Murmansk, however, which would have seriously hindered Allied Lend-Lease shipments to the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>TFF is played in sequential &ldquo;game turns,&rdquo; each of which is composed of interactive &ldquo;phases&rdquo; and &ldquo;sub-phases.&rdquo; During each Operations Phase, the players alternate picking markers from the command pool; each such pick thereby indicating which sub-command will be &ldquo;activated&rdquo; for movement and combat at that time. The High Command marker causes the Orders From The High Command Table to be checked. The player controlling a selected sub-command receives reinforcements for it, if any are available that game turn, and then moves and conducts combat with the units of that sub-command.<br/><br/>The armies in TFF are divided into &ldquo;sub-commands,&rdquo; each of which operates as a semi-autonomous force within its overall army. Sub-commands are defined by abbreviations and colored stripes on the unit-counters. Pulling certain markers will allow a player to conduct operations simultaneously with more than one sub-command.<br/><br/>Published in World at War magazine #5, 2009.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 month<br/>Hex: 23 miles / 37 kilometers<br/>Units: Battalion to Division<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (228 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page Zhukov&rsquo;s War rulebook<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: Medium<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-6<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Capturing the real-world thrill and challenges of planetary exploration, XTRONAUT&trade;: The Game of Solar System Exploration gives 2 &ndash; 4 players ages 7 and up the chance to develop space missions and explore the solar system. The game is based on real planetary missions and rocket science. It also contains elements of politics and strategy that are inspired by the real-life situations that space missions face.<br/><br/>How do you complete your space mission?<br/><br/>Each player selects a Mission Card from the deck. This card determines the player's mission &ndash; the mission destination, type of spacecraft needed, the amount of Delta-V needed to achieve the mission, the potential to obtain gravity assists, and the points earned for completing the mission. Delta-V stands for change in velocity, and as applied to space missions and this game, it means the change in velocity necessary for a spacecraft to complete a selected mission.<br/><br/>Game play is straightforward. On their turn each player draws a playing card, plays up to three Action Cards, trades with other players, and places components on their game board. The Action Cards add real-life issues to the game that space missions often encounter - project cancellations, audits, government shutdowns, and other exciting twists and turns.<br/><br/>To complete a mission you must populate your game board with the right combination of cards for mission success. Each player needs to collect the Playing Cards that give them the right spacecraft, first and second stage rockets, and matching fairings. Gravity assist and solid rocket booster cards are available to provide additional Delta-V if needed to complete the assigned mission. Once the mission is complete, the player earns the points for the mission, which varies based on the size of the spacecraft and the target, and starts work on their next mission. The first player to score 10 points wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the role of one of 12 transient characters who stalk the back alleys and gutters, rifling through dumpsters in search of valuable trash.<br/><br/>Whether you&rsquo;re a crust punk, a hobo rail-rider, a trust fund poseur, or Woody Guthrie&rsquo;s actual ghost, all players have the same ultimate goal: rootin&rsquo; around in the trash til you&rsquo;ve collected the booze, smokes, snax, and dope you need to summon the TRASH LORD and be anointed his one true glorious Trash Child.<br/><br/>Players can take up to 4 actions on their turn (skitch from venue to venue, dig for things in the dumpsters, trash cards from their hand to take advantage of special actions, stash things they've collected in the Squat, sacrifice cards for special &quot;blessings&quot; from the Trash Lord, panhandle to get more HP, and more). The first player to have all 4 things (booze, snax, smokes, and dope) in their stash and play a SUMMON card at the Altar wins the game.<br/><br/>Each dumpster is different, and some more dangerous. Digging deeper can yield more rewards, but it&rsquo;s also askin&rsquo; for trouble. This town is lousy with cops, and the nefarious garbage critters known as Trashlings are waiting in the shadows to swipe your beautiful junk. Even your fellow street urchins might just get wasted and jump you if your stash is lookin&rsquo; a little too tempting. If you run out of HP, you're dead. Players must carefully manage their turns and constantly be on the move (and on their guard) as they booze, scrap, panhandle, and race to be the first to summon the TRASH LORD (peace be upon him).<br/><br/>",

With the favor of the gods, we shall lead our people to become the chosen tribe that will bring unity and strength to the empire once again.<br/><br/>Gods of Rome is a competitive area-control game that uses worker placement and card activation and lasts around 60 minutes. Players each choose a tribe at the start of the game and must lead that tribe to gain the gods' favor. On your turn, choose one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Visit a God: Gain a god's blessing token, which allows you to take an enhanced action later in the game, and place one meeple in that god's color &mdash; which might also be a player's color &mdash; on the game board in a matching-colored location.<br/>     Activate a card: Place a token on an action space on your player board to add more figures to the board, move figures, and attack opponents. If you have a blessing token of the same color as the location where the action takes place, you can take an enhanced action.<br/>     Score: Advance on the victory track depending on which territories you control in regions that match the gods you have visited, then clear all action spaces and remove your tokens from the god spaces. Special objectives change the scoring of territories from game to game.<br/><br/><br/>The favor track features three checkpoints, and as players gain favor, they advance on this track; if a player hits a checkpoint, all players score points based on their relative position on the favor track, then they advance to the checkpoint. After a player reaches the third checkpoint, players again score points, then whoever has the highest overall score wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Now he returns for the last time to his Tower, wherin lies the magic that makes one Wizard supreme over all others.  For captured within is the magical Power of Transformation that allows a creature to enter the Tower as one self-- and emerge as another!  An Elf of the Forests may be transformed into an Ogre of the Mountains.  A Warrior from the Plains may become a Skeleton of the Swamps.  Each of these creatures has his own special powers, special strengths-- and special fears.<br/><br/>The Wizard King sets his foot at the base of the Ramp of Time and prepares to begin his final ascent up the 15 steps to the Tower.  He has but one thought:  Which of his four apprentice Wizards--Terra, Zephyron, Solanos, or Oceanus-- will use the Tower's magic most strategically and prove himself on the field of battle?  For the Wizard who demonstrates the strongest powers and wins the most pennants will succeed him.  The moment the Ancient One steps onto the Tower, the apprentice will become the next Wizard King.<br/><br/>Word of the Great One's decline has spread throughout the realm.  In minor skirmishes, the four young Wizards have already begun to test their strengths.<br/><br/>Now YOU can take the part of one of the four and join their battle. Throughout the adventure, you will remain just one of the four apprentice Wizards, but you will periodically transform yourself into any of the eight different creatures.  And in the end, which of you Wizards will prove youself strongest, conquer the most enemies, capture the most castles and pennants-- and ascend the throne in the Tower?  Which of you will become the new Wizard King?<br/><br/>",

On June 22 in Byelorussia, more than a million Soviet soldiers swept against the German Army Group Centre: the Allied counter-offensive was underway and would not stop until it reached Berlin.<br/>From Overlord to Berlin is a strategic wargame that simulates the end of the Second World War in Europe on all fronts: east, west and Italy. One player directs the Axis forces and must resist Allied pressure for as long as possible while the other directs the Soviets and the Western Allies and must wipe out Nazi Germany and its satellites before the end of the game. The simulation begins in June 1944 with the Normandy landings, the fall of Rome in Italy and Operation Bagration in the east. There was still hard fighting ahead including crossing the Rhine and pushing forward into the heart of the Reich, surrounding numerous armies in the Ruhr and reaching the Elbe.<br/>In the east, Hitler&rsquo;s counter-attacks in Hungary and in Poland accomplished nothing against the might of the Russian bear.<br/>At the beginning of January, Russian troops attacked along the Vistula and drove the Germans back to the Oder. Budapest fell in February, and Vienna was captured in April. Finally, the offensive on Berlin began in April and the Reich fell at the beginning of May 1945, putting an end to the Second World War in Europe.<br/><br/>The cardboard pocket includes :<br/>216 die-cut counters (Units : fronts, armies and army corps)<br/>1 Zone map of Europe from France to USSR, 59 x 40 cm<br/>1 rulebook, 2 player aids<br/><br/><br/>French or English Rules and Charts.<br/><br/>",

If the player knows what the clue is, they throw a chip in a bin on the game board.  Once the time is up, the 10 words have been clued, or the player elects to stop, they begin recalling the words that were clued from memory.  Upon getting the word correct (with one guess at each one only), a chip is taken out of the bin and put down on the guesser's side of the board.  If the clue is missed or if it is forgotten, the chip stays in the bin.  Once the guessing is completed or the time runs out, the other team gets a chance to steal the chips that remain in the bin.  If the remaining chips are not stolen, they go back to the guessing team.  The object is to fill up your side of the board with correctly guessed or stolen chips.<br/><br/>",

Tension hangs in the air until a scream tears the silence &quot;Serve the King!&quot;<br/><br/>In Sirvam o Rei, players take on the role of these cooks.<br/>Each player starts with four cards face down in front of them, representing the available recipes. During his turn, a player draws a new card from the deck and decides whether to discard it (activating its ability if he wishes) or trade it without revealing it for any of his other recipes. At any time, a player may skip his turn by exclaiming &quot;Serve the King&quot; and activate the last round.<br/><br/>There are 4 kings and 1 queen with different tastes that modify the final goal and the importance of certain recipes. Whether it is the Ogre King who is disgusted by sweets and fresh foods or the Elven Sea Queen who has very strong opinions on seafood recipes, it's up to the players to adapt their cooking to the demands and present the best dishes of the banquet.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(Question and illustration cards have text in Italian, English, German and French.) On a turn, a player either plays and reads a question card &ndash; which the player who holds the illustration card must answer as honestly as possible &ndash; or tries to guess the word hidden on the card. Before a player guesses, he can ante any number of chips into the pot. If no one else matches his ante, he claims all the chips in the pot without having to guess the word; if at least one other player antes, he must give his guess, winning the pot if correct.<br/><br/>When a round end, the next player chooses a word from an illustration card and the game continues. When one player runs out of chips, the game ends and the player with the most chips wins.<br/><br/>",

You need to take some risks in order to win. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to purposely mess with other players!<br/><br/>In Troublez players flip cards from one huge shared deck and sort zombies into three rows on the table. Every card must follow several placement rules. First, numbers can go only up and second, no two cards of the same color can be next to each other. When you successfully play a card onto the table, you can decide to stop and collect all the cards from a row of your choice, or you can push your luck and flip another card. If you cannot legally play a card, that is a bad luck and you are getting nothing!<br/><br/>The deck consists of zombies in three colors, but cards with special abilities can be also found there. A Net allows you to steal a zombie card from another player. With A Shotgun you can discard some zombies others are holding and if you get An Axe, you must discard a card yourself. You can be clever with your cards, since after a players turn each other player gets to grab a card from the table. Will you leave them something good? Or will you maneuver so only The Axe is waiting there?<br/><br/>To assemble a horde you must turn in a set of cards &ndash; four cards of the same number, or five cards of different numbers. At the end whoever has the strongest army wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the package:<br/><br/>Gather your players and face off for gridiron glory! <br/>Third and Long recreates the action of a pro football game. Two coaches take turns on offense and defense, calling plays and executing drives. Touchdowns, field goals, fumbles, interceptions, penalties, and big plays are all part of the exciting action. Join the fun as the teams of the Professional Football League compete for the Championship Trophy!<br/><br/><br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>In Third and Long, two players take on the role of opposing coaches in a game of American Football.<br/><br/>Each coach chooses a team from the star players included in the game. Pre-made teams are provided for simplicity, or a draft with a salary cap can be held to form the teams. Teams do not have all 11 players represented, they simply comprise of the star players from the following skill positions: QB, RB, WR, LB, CB, S.<br/><br/>A coin flip determines who starts out on Offense and who will initially play defense. Players share two decks of play call cards. The coach on offense takes the Offensive Play Calls and the coach on defense takes the Defensive Play Calls.<br/><br/>Coaches choose their respective play calls in secret, revealing them at the same time. The interaction between the offensive and defensive play call determines the match up of star players involved in the play. Action Cards (which form each player's hand) are used to further influence the outcome of each play.<br/><br/>The game is made up of a series of drives. Each drive is made up of a randomly determined number of &quot;Key Moments&quot; (from 1 to 5). Key Moments represent those special times during a football game that mean the difference between success and failure. For each Key Moment, a play occurs. If the offense is able to win that number of plays in a row, they score.<br/><br/>If the defense is able to stop the offense on any of the Key Moments in a given drive, then a fourth down has occurred. Most of the time a punt will follow, but sometimes the coach on offense is desperate and will attempt to go for it.<br/><br/>Each game results in real football game-like scores, and uses nothing but cards (no extra components to keep track of field position or time on the clock). Interceptions, fumbles, big plays, injuries, field goals, touchdowns, safeties, extra points... its all in there!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Jurassik, players are paleontologists on a dig looking for dinosaur bones. Ideally you want to collect bones for the same type of dinosaur so that you can assemble a complete skeleton!<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the 32 dinosaur cards (four cards each of eight different dinosaurs) are shuffled with one &quot;start excavations&quot; card and 15 randomly-chosen action cards from a total of 22. A player shuffles these cards, lays them out in a 6x8 rectangle, then removes the start excavations card to show where the dig begins.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player reveals any card that has at least one edge adjacent to the digging area. Dinosaur and action cards have different backs, so the player knows what type of card he draws, but not which card exactly. If she draws a dinosaur card, she places it face-up in front of her. If she draws an action card, she may be able to take a second turn, steal from another player, or force an exchange of one bone for another; she may also be forced to discard a card, or she might end up with a rock, which is placed back in the dig area for everyone to work around. When a player has four cards of the same dinosaur, she groups them as a set; these cards cannot be lost or stolen.<br/><br/>The game ends when the final dinosaur card is collected. Players score 1, 3, 6 or 10 points for a set of 1-4 dinosaur cards of the same type, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

In each of these titles, players are presented with a mysterious story that they must unravel over the course of play. Working together, players explore common areas, talk to people, look for clues, and combine various items to reveal the secret of the story. Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!<br/><br/>Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.<br/><br/>In Adventure Games: Die drei ??? &ndash; Das Geheimnis der Statue, dive deep into an exciting and mysterious adventure with Rocky Beach detectives Justus Jonas, Peter Shaw and Bob Andrews. Together the team decides in which direction the case will develop as they explore locations, combine objects, and solve puzzles.<br/><br/>",

Do you have what it takes to become the next Grand Siege Magus?&quot;<br/><br/>In Wizard&rsquo;s Gambit, players become wizards who take turns placing Magical Components on Spells in a common Spell Pool in the center of the play area.<br/><br/>When all of the required Magical Components have been placed on a given Spell, the wizard who completed that Spell claims it as their own, creating a Spell Book face up in front of them. Once the Spell is added to their Spell Book, a wizard may immediately apply the effects of the Spell, giving him more power to defeat his competitors.<br/><br/>Wizards can further affect the course of play by casting Incantation cards during their turn, which can provide advantages in playing the game. Additionally, wizards can invoke the highest power, the Wizard&rsquo;s Gambit, to thwart other wizard competitors and increase their chance of claiming powerful Spells for their own.<br/><br/>Each Spell has a point value, which adds up cumulatively to represent their Spell Book&rsquo;s score. The first wizard to reach a Spell point total of ten (10) points wins the game and is proclaimed Grand Siege Magus.<br/><br/>Wizard's Gambit is a light-hearted game for the casual gamer and for family play.<br/><br/>",

At the start of a round, each player gets a hand of five cards, places one of them face down on their longship, passes the cards left, chooses another card, etc. until they have five cards on their longship.<br/><br/>They then take these cards in hand, and everyone simultaneously chooses a card and places it face down on the table. You're using these animals to win treasure chests, which also come in blue, yellow, and red. The chests are shuffled and placed in two piles. You play your card by a face-up chest, then everyone reveals their card:<br/><br/><br/>    If your animal doesn't match the color of the chest, remove it from play.<br/>    If only one animal is by a chest, that player's owner claims it.<br/>    If multiple animals are by a chest, whoever played the highest number wins the chest.<br/><br/><br/>Continue to play until you've played all five cards. If any chests remain, shuffle the animal cards and play another round. Once all the chests have been claimed, turn over the chest cards and count the coins on them to see who has the biggest treasure haul!<br/><br/>The game includes three animal chiefs that have a value of 0, but a unique special ability that can possibly win you a chest you wouldn't have got otherwise. Shuffle them into the animal deck for an additional challenge.<br/><br/>",

In Bright Got 'Em you outsmart and corner your opponents through savvy card play, sly movement, and clever placement of blocking walls. In the still-casual, but even-trickier Brainy Got 'Em! you toss aside card actions in favor of a purely strategic challenge.<br/><br/>Both games share the same goal, the same exciting intrigue, and the same social fun. <br/>Place walls to trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours!<br/><br/>Surround yourself with friends and family. Get ready to enjoy mroe fun than any four walls could ever contain! It's time you Got 'Em!<br/>Play Summary:<br/>The goal: trap your opponents' pawns before they trap yours. Last pawn free wins!<br/><br/>Bright Got 'Em! (use colored side of the board)<br/>In Bright Got 'Em!, each player starts with 3 cards and pawn. Place your pawn on the same-colored start square (one of the four squares at the corners of the board's center square). The player who's birthday is closest, goes first.<br/><br/>On your turn you will play a card, following each rule in the order they appear. Most cards have 2 instructions. The first tells you where you can place a wall and the second how many square you can move your pawn.<br/><br/>Wall Placement Rules:<br/>Walls can only be placed along one edge of a square, between two squares.<br/>When a player's pawn is trapped by walls in a single square, that player is eliminated from the game. The edge of the board counts as a wall.<br/>There are a few cards that allow you to remove a wall or pass through a wall. However, you have to play these cards before your pawn is trapped! <br/>Once your pawn is trapped in a single square, you're out and your pawn is removed from the board.<br/>When you trap another player's pawn, thus eliminating him from the game, you may remove any 1 wall from the board.<br/><br/>Moving Your Pawn<br/>Most cards allow you to move your pawn up to a specific number of squares.<br/>You can't move through walls, unless you play a card that allows it.<br/>You can't move through a square occupied by another pawn.<br/>You may only move orthogonally, never diagonally.<br/>You can stay where you are.<br/>You don't have to move the exact number of squares listed on the card. You can move fewer squares if you want.<br/>You can move zig zag, first in one direction, then in another, just not diagonally up to the number of squares specified on the card you played.<br/><br/>After placing a wall and moving (or not), discard the card you played and draw another. (You should always have 3 cards in your hand.) Play passes to the player on your left.<br/><br/>The last player to have a pawn on the board wins!<br/><br/>Brainy Got 'Em! (use white side of board)<br/>You don't need any cards for this version. The goal is the same: trap your opponents' pawns while illuding capture yourself.<br/><br/>On your turn, place a wall anywhere on the board, then move your pawn.<br/>The number of squares you can move your pawn is equal to 1 plus the number of walls on your square. You may place a wall on the square your pawn occupies to increase your pawn's movement on the same turn.<br/><br/>All other rules are the same as Bright Got 'Em!<br/><br/>Contents: 1 double-sided game board (Bright Got 'Em! on one side, Brainy Got 'Em! on the other), 84 wall pieces, 55 Got 'Em! cards, 4 pawns, game rules.<br/><br/>",

Now in card game form, no real blood will be spilled, but the strategy, tactics, and power-plays still abound. Based upon a game that exists in the True Blood universe, Night Eternal: The Game is a competitive card game of intrigue, power-plays and betrayal where vampires jockey for power, position and ultimate control of the rival factions: The Authority and The Monarchy.<br/><br/>Players must ante blood from their pools to both factions each turn of the game. Players build up their hands by acquiring cards from a powerful, but temperamental Immortals deck and a willing and able Agent deck. The cards that a player chooses to play will determine the faction to which he or she is loyal...for now. In turn order, each player plays out one card (face up) during each of three rounds each turn, so you never just how much power it will take to seize control of a faction each turn.<br/><br/>Players must pay attention to the cards their opponents are playing. It's more difficult to enable a powerful card's special ability if your opponents are playing weaker cards. Weaker card special abilities are easy to resolve, but weakness doesn't win the war. Special abilities might allow a player to steal blood from a faction or move it from one faction to another, so switching your loyalty to a new faction (by playing cards of that faction) might just throw off your opponents' best laid plans.<br/><br/>In the end, power still rules the day. At the end of each turn (after three rounds of card play), the cards are scored. The player with the highest value of Authority cards earns that faction's blood pool. The player with the highest value of Monarchy cards earns that faction's blood pool. The key to victory is to have more blood tokens than any other player when the first player dies...by running out<br/>of blood.<br/><br/>",

Now is your opportunity to face off Poseidon against Ishtar! Thor against Cthulhu! Morrigan against Yog-Sothoth! You have one goal and one goal only: annihilate your foes' believers and seize absolute power.<br/><br/>Achieve this task by staking the souls of your followers, using the same bluff, psychology, and tactics that have made Texas Hold 'em Poker the world's premier card game. Once you seize victory, you can rest, and listen to the cheerful song of your people. You have won the clash of the gods. You have won Theomachy.<br/><br/>The game is quick to play &ndash; typically less than 45 minutes. First, choose your god. Then, drafting cards into your personal deck lets you slowly build your might. Ante up your followers, and stake them against your foes' minions. You can call, raise, or fold, in similar fashion to high-stakes Poker games (and what stake is higher than your own worshipers' souls?)<br/><br/>Your spells are powered by a Constellation, which is laid down in the middle of the table as a Texas Hold'em Poker style flop, river, and turn. Just as in Hold 'em, some Constellation configurations provide you with great combinations for your secret hand of cards, some are disastrous, while most are middling to fair.<br/><br/>Using miracles, spells, and powerful artifacts, powered by the Constellation, send your followers into battles, build temples, and inflict terrible curses on the unfaithful. You face a tough decision in every hand: do you put your power on the line to help your believers, or do you turn your back to cut your losses, abandoning them to certain death? If neither you nor your opponents yield, the showdown takes place - hurricanes are opposed by deathly plagues, tempests extinguish walls of fire, and the ranks of the faithful shrink every second.<br/><br/>Use your god&rsquo;s power to create miracles and activate myth cards for your heroes, temples, and godly artifacts. For example, the Norse pantheon has access to the Fenris wolf, Thor's hammer, and more. Babylon has Lilith, Ur, the tower of Babel, and more. Even the Lovecraft pantheons have myth cards and their own dark miracles. Place Wilbur Whateley in the forefront of your fight, or wield the Pallid Mask!<br/><br/>Theomachy: The Ancients includes four pantheons: Greek, Babylonian, Egyptian, and Lovecraft's Outer Gods.<br/><br/>",

Aligning the board wins star crystals, and three star crystals light up your constellation to win the game.<br/><br/>",

The value of each set of tiles is based on the standard, idiosyncratic ranking of Chinese dominoes, an order that often does not correlate with the numerical value of the tile. Players unable to beat the high set during a trick must discard an equivalent amount of tiles face down. Points are awarded during the round, for special plays, and at the end, based on the number of tiles won by each player. Score multipliers may also apply, depending on the endgame conditions. Like Poker, it is typically played as a gambling game using chips.<br/><br/>",

After that, all players use coordinates and other information from the two cards left on the table to draw their tourists and routes.<br/><br/>During the game, route segments are drawn, connecting different types of tourists to various landmarks and attractions. A game of En Route lasts exactly 10 rounds. At the end of the game, each place of interest on the final route will earn players Prestige Points according to its rules. Whoever creates the most satisfying tour route, wins!<br/><br/>The game features constant and quite intense player interaction, and players have a fair degree of control and can strategize. It plays fast, dynamic, and makes you constantly think about what your opponents want to do (and sometimes even negotiate so that they play cards that are beneficial to you!).<br/><br/>",

The game depicts a space race from Earth to Saturn (hence the dinky Dan Dare style metal spaceships).<br/><br/>Later Astron was published as an around-the-world travel game.<br/><br/>Even later this around-the-world travel game was given the more apt name Sky Lanes otherwise using the same components.<br/><br/>The special feature common to all versions is a game board that scrolls from one end to the other. Players are dealt cards to help them both in moving their rocket or plane and in scrolling the game board. In the travel version each time a player's plane sits on an airport space at the end of any player's turn, they get an Airport card. Similarly, if a player's plane ends any turn on a hazard, they draw a Hazard card.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to have the most points in hand when the board reaches the &quot;GAME OVER&quot; position. Airport cards add to your point total; Hazards subtract from it.<br/><br/>While the rolling board, card drafting mechanism and even game play are the same, the British (Waddingtons) and American (Parker) games look very different.  There are pictures of both versions in the gallery.<br/><br/>The game was released at a time in the period when commercial air travel was really taking off.<br/><br/>",

A large narrow mapboard represents the area from Eindhoven by Nijmegen to Arnhem. Units are plastic pieces representing infantry, tanks and artillery; 13 important plastic bridges are included. Almost every bridge is a stepping-stone to success. And every bridge can be blown.<br/><br/>The purpose of the game is to reach Arnhem and make contact with the British paras. The time frame is restricted and if the Allied player doesn't reach Arnhem on time, the paras are doomed and an easy target for the German elite forces!<br/><br/>The RULES are short and simple: the game focusses on strategy, and nothing else.<br/><br/>The game map has all the necessary information needed to play the game. Once you've read the rules once, there's no need to look up things anymore. (almost) Every bit of information is on the map.<br/>No looking up hit probabilities, defense factors, or attack factors in rows and columns. No measuring with rulers. Just roll the dice.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved with the use of ten-sided color coded dice: so there's some luck involved, but a reasonable level.<br/><br/>Good tactics require the use of an optimal mix of units to get the job done.<br/>Each kind of unit has its specific strength and weakness, depending on the battleground. Players should choose wisely which units to use where and when.<br/>In this game the players don't get to choose the casualties themselves: a roll with the dice reveals the distribution of the hits. The FOG OF WAR is simulated by distributing the hits at random. In this way you are never totally in control: you plan your strategies, you work out plans, you anticipate as much as you can, but the outcome is never, ever perfect. With &quot;Arnhem'44&quot; both players get a much more 'realistic' game experience playing this game.<br/><br/>",

The internet is therefore full of &lsquo;if it fits, it sits&rsquo; images.<br/><br/>In If It Fits players will be playing cards from their hands to create boxes for cats to sit in. Players will aim to create boxes with cat toys in them, while avoiding water sprayers. Having cat toys in your boxes will earn you points whereas water sprayers will result in penalties. By connecting boxes, players are able to take over boxes of other players unless players seal off all sides of their boxes. Sealing off boxes has the added benefit of doubling earned points in that box. However to complicate matters, a players&rsquo; cat (which claims a box) can be chased off by the black cat in the game: Princess.<br/><br/>The moment a player has used all their cats or if the draw deck is depleted, the game ends. The score is determined and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo!&rdquo; is a multi-player combat game in which each of 2-4 players controls a segment of Tokyo under attack by the dreaded Godran, Self-Appointed Emperor of Monsters.  Players must protect their areas from the rampaging monster by deploying units of the national guard while at the same time evacuating tasty populace units.  As key production units in each sector are destroyed by Godran, the players&rsquo; resources dwindle.  Perhaps only a hastily-developed super weapon can save the day!<br/><br/>Players have many options in &ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo.&rdquo;  Each turn, their remaining production centers generate a number of &ldquo;Mega-Yen&rdquo; to be spent in a variety of ways.  First, players bid &ldquo;Mega-Yen&rdquo; to control Godran.  Each turn, Godran could be controlled by a different player.  Victory point incentives will keep Godran rampaging - but if you win the bidding, Godran will rampage someplace other than your back yard!<br/><br/>Mega-Yen can also be used to activate defense units, to evacuate panicked yet recalcitrant citizenry, and to develop super weapons to combat the mighty Godran.  Jury-rig a Death Ray and hope for a quick knockout punch, or undertake the longer and more expensive, but more sure-fire, process of researching Godran&rsquo;s origins to find his weakness. The Mega-Yen is an imaginary currency whose value, for the purposes of this game, is ridiculously high.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo!&rdquo; plays essentially the same with two, three or four players.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Oh No, There Goes Tokyo!&rdquo; (Also known as ON,TGT!) contains a fold-out map that represents a hypothetical section of downtown Tokyo.  It could be any city, but Tokyo seems to be the most attractive to monsters.  Players are encouraged to substitute cities they particularly dislike if the urge strikes.  The game includes a set of counters representing Godran, destroyed buildings, the national guard in four colors and populace units in four colors.  Also included are a small selection of cards -  representing potential origin points for Godran and hair brained schemes to control the beast.  Relevant charts are included in the back of the rules for ease of access.  Play requires the use of multiple six sided dice to resolve combat and scrap paper for record keeping.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Somali Pirates, designed by Joseph Miranda, is a wargame set in a hypothetical Coalition campaign to destroy the power of pirates based in Somalia, as well as to otherwise gain control of that country. The assumption of the game is that the pirates, in league with local warlords and Al Qaeda, have become strong enough to be an even bigger threat to the region than they are now. In response, various powers launch military action against them.<br/> There are two players in Somali Pirates: The Coalition, who wants to destroy the pirates, and the Pirates, who want to survive, as well as to maximize their own power and wealth. Central to play of the game is the Netwar Index. Each player has a Netwar Index that indicates how successful he is in achieving his goals...effectively, representing the amount of public support that each side is getting. The Netwar Index affects various aspects of the game, such as mobilization of reinforcements, and is also part of gaining victory.<br/> Both players have a set of counters that represent their naval, land, air and special operations forces (SOF). Players move their pieces across the spaces on the map and engage in various kinds of conflict in order to destroy enemy forces, seize critical geographical regions, and change the Netwar Index (hopefully in their favor). Both sides can mobilize new units by paying for them with Netwar Points. Given the asymmetry of the situation, each side in the game will have several unique rules..<br/> The game includes one map of East Africa and environs, from the Red Sea to the Indian Ocean, and one counter-sheet (228 counters) representing various pirate and Al Qaeda forces, local militias and warlords, plus the principle Coalition forces (primarily NATO and the United States, and even a potential inclusion of a Chinese expeditionary force).<br/> The game includes one map (22x34&rdquo;) and 176 counters.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This off road racing game uses a large three dimensional board very similar to Fireball Island.  Players race their 4x4 vehicles with the roll of a special six sided die without a 1 pip but it has a star instead.  Rolling a star allows you to move opponents cars and roll again.  Cars can roll freely on the board and possibly roll off the board or crash.  When movement ends, you must release your 4x4 and see if it &quot;free wheels.&quot;  Rolling off the board or crashing means the loss of a turn while you get your 4x4 back on the road.  Seven boulders on the road (placed at the start of the game) stop movement, but are removed from the game when first encountered.  Light hearted and fun, especially with younger players.<br/><br/>",

Players look at these cards, then turn them face down. On a turn, a player rolls the two dice: one showing a number, the other a characteristic of a burglar card. If the player can identify the correct item on the correct burglar card, they claim that card as a reward, then put a new card in its place. Whoever collects the most cards wins.<br/><br/>",

As one of the Faction Leaders, you'll guide your people to colonize Earth-017. Manage your resources, employ your workers, exploit what the planet has to offer to the fullest in this hexagon game of sci-fi civilization. But remember: the planet is far from deserted!<br/><br/>Terra-017 is a strategic game of hexagon placement, that will let you build colonies on a planet while repelling the alien resistance. Since the first moments you'll realize that the game recalls classics like StarCraft and that it will let you see your colonies grow and develop before your eyes, all illustrated by the excellent art of Valeria Rossi. It's a game in which the ability to plan long term and to react to unexpected player moves or events have equal weight. The hexes represent various buildings you can build and there is a limited number of them, so you'll have to choose an effective strategy to take hold of them and at the same time work towards the objectives that will net you points at the end of each of the three in-game years. Some hexes will give you resources to build, while others will have special abilities, usually activated with your workers. There is going to be a constant struggle with the other players to build the best colony, but pay attention to the annual alien attack, that could do some serious damage to your colonies if you don't prepare in time!<br/>Each year is also divided in the four seasons, each with its own deck of events that will influence the game, forcing you to adapt. Knowing when to build, recruiting new workers or activating special abilities is the key to success.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game takes inspiration from the great air races of circa 1908 to 1913 which took place in the pioneering era of air travel. These air races galvanized interest across the world and encouraged by generous prizes by newspapers and other sponsors attracted international entries. Air travel was risky and most unreliable. Often only a small number of the entrants would make it to the finish line. Will one of your pilots manage to face up to the challenge?  But watch out: In this era of gentlemanly behavior and stiff upper lips, there are a few cads and bounders who will cheat to win.<br/><br/>In Magnificent Flying Machines, the player who ends the game with the most victory points wins. These can be earned in various ways including being the first to land successfully on a certain terrain tile, landing on the middle airfield, transporting cargo or passengers, or performing trick maneuvers. Simply being the first to cross the finishing line is unlikely to be enough on its own to secure a victory. The winner will be the player who picks a strategy that best matches the abilities of the pilot and features of the flying machine they are using.<br/><br/>The game is played in a series of rounds. A round begins with the first player taking a turn. Each player takes their turn in order clockwise around the table. During a turn a player has two action phases available. There are three types of action phase to choose from. These are the takeoff phase (which may also include refueling, repairing and scavenging spare parts), the flying phase (which may also include gaining altitude and performing trick maneuvers), and the landing phase (which may also include refueling). In addition, whenever a flying machine lands on a terrain tile any passengers that wish to will disembark, and any cargo intended for that terrain type is unloaded. It may also take on available equipment, cargo and passengers if space is available to do so.<br/><br/>Players progress in the game by passing a series of takeoff, flying and landing tests. To determine the difficulty of a particular test, first look at the number of symbols for that test shown on the terrain tile that the flying machine is on. Simply add the number of symbols shown on the terrain tile to the number of symbols on the relevant weather tile. If a player needs to take a test, first check to see the total number of relevant symbols shown on the flying machine dashboard. This is the number of dice that may be rolled when attempting to obtain a sufficient number of symbols to pass the test. If the player does not roll enough symbols they may then choose to make use of special equipment, use spare parts, or play trick and boost cards to obtain additional symbols in order to pass the test. If a player is unable to obtain a sufficient number of symbols to pass the test then a failure occurs. If the dice rolled include a catastrophic failure symbol, then a catastrophic failure occurs. The effects of such a failure vary depending on the test being taken.<br/><br/>",

Anno Domini: Essen &amp; Trinken contains historical events related to food, beverages, etc. Like all Anno Domini sets, this game can be played as a standalone or mixed with some or even all editions.<br/><br/>In Anno Domini: Essen &amp; Trinken, each player receives nine cards (or fewer, if you want the game to be shorter) and may look only at the descriptions. In turn, players place a card on the table, trying to place their card in chronological order to those already present. Instead of adding a card, a player may claim that the order in which the cards have been placed is incorrect. In this case all cards are turned over and the correct years revealed.<br/><br/>If the order is correct, then the doubting player receives two cards and skips a turn. If the order is incorrect, then the previous player &ndash; who accepted the order as correct or made it incorrect through her own placement &ndash; receives three cards. The first player with no cards remaining in hand wins.<br/><br/>Note that Anno Domini: Gesundheit &amp; Ern&auml;hrung was discontinued and split into Anno Domini: Gesundheit and Anno Domini: Essen &amp; Trinken. About half of the events in each of these new editions were previously part of Anno Domini: Gesundheit &amp; Ern&auml;hrung and half of the events are new.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from ATO website):<br/><br/>Two years after the last US troops left Vietnam, People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) General Van Tien Dung launched Operation 275, a &quot;limited&quot; offensive designed to set up an attack on the provincial capital of Pleiko. Rapid collapse of South Vietnamese (ARVN) forces caused a change in plan, with PAVN forces quickly taking one city after another, pausing only before an attack on Saigon itself. Based on previous performance, when three full PAVN divisions, supported by tanks and ample artillery, attacked one depleted ARVN division at Xu&acirc;n Lộc, Dung expected a cake walk. What he got was a Meatgrinder instead.<br/><br/>For two bloody weeks, a division regarded as &quot;unreliable&quot; held back everything the PAVN could throw against them, inflicting heavy losses. No one, on either side, expected such heavy fighting. And hardly anyone thought that this would actually be &quot;the last battle&quot; of a 30 year conflict. It was.<br/><br/>Now, Against the Odds lets you refight this key moment in history, with Meatgrinder: Battle for  Xu&acirc;n Lộc, 1975. The design uses a variable initiative system that keeps both sides uncertain, and features all the weapon systems that made this battle, and this period, so distinctive. The ARVN player employs cluster bombs, daisy cutters, M-48 tanks, and helicopters against seemingly overwhelming numbers of PAVN troops, artillery, and T-54 tanks. Leadership, close assaults, and airborne operations are also included...all the tools for attack and defense that made this a classic confrontation.<br/><br/>Meatgrinder and issue #33 of ATO:<br/>Map - One full color 22&quot;x34&quot; mapsheet<br/>Counters - 280 full color 1/2&quot; die-cut pieces<br/>Rules length - 10 pages<br/>Charts and tables - 2 pages<br/>Complexity - Medium<br/>Solitaire suitability - Average<br/><br/>",

These are iconic moments in history, from the rise of the Roman Empire to the Industrial Revolution, from the Second World War to the colonisation of Mars. Each Butterfly Effect Mission will require knowledge to be collected or technology to be developed.<br/><br/>Chronoships travel through wormholes to visit different locations in space and time, known as Time Zones (TZs). There are 12 TZs in total, TZ1 represents the ancient past, whereas TZ12 represents the distant future. New Alternate TZs will also spawn throughout the game, the &ldquo;Butterfly Effect&rdquo; of players meddling with the space-time continuum.<br/><br/>Each player will start by drafting two crew-members to activate their first two Chronoships. These crew-members will be famous people from history or the future and each will have different primary and secondary abilities. It is possible to control an additional three Chronoships by recruiting new crew-members to command them.<br/><br/>Primary abilities enhance the collection of one of five types of knowledge: Military, Exploration, Science, Politics or Culture.<br/><br/>Secondary abilities come in 13 varieties which will help the player to compete with their rivals, ranging from Merchants to Medics, from Spies to Superstars.<br/><br/>Utopia provides a unique experience every time, as the combination of different crew-members, technologies and missions call for the constant revision of player strategies.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Your task is to juggle supply and demand to best outfit the heroes with what they&rsquo;ll need. Do your job wrong and a brave knight may end up fighting a dragon with nothing but twigs and shoelaces. Do your job right, and you may help save the world.<br/><br/>The game utilizes a color-coded dice drafting system, where players pick dice one by one to perform actions such as generating new resource cubes, moving resources around town, bidding on new buildings, or selling resources to heroes. Depending on the action, the color and number on the die matter in different ways - use a red weapon die, and you can generate weapon resources in your town, whereas a blue magic die may allow you to move magic resources from your production centers to your shops. Higher numbers on the dice make your actions more powerful, but they also make you a target: players can steal dice from each other or send spies into the towns of players who have an edge.<br/><br/>Each hero has different needs. Some may want several weapons, whereas others may want a mix of magic and potion resources. If you have the corresponding resources in your town, you can sell those to the hero, where every sale awards victory points. The more you sell, the more victory points you gain, and the more likely it is you'll win!<br/><br/>",

To do this, you must defeat the other player by eliminating their 4 armor and 4 health tokens.<br/><br/>Use cards to inflict damage and defend. When taking a turn, you may attack by playing an offensive card. To defend, play a card with a defensive value and subtract it from the attack value to determine if the hit landed.<br/><br/>After taking an action, you may play an action card face down. This is your defensive stance during your opponent's turn. When you opponent takes an action, you may reveal your stance card. However, if your opponent chooses to attack, your stance will break and any benefit to be gained from it will be lost.<br/><br/>Divine beings and forces of nature called kami provide crucial support in battle. Every kami possesses two abilities: an active one that requires playing a purify card and a passive ability that is &quot;always on.&quot; Not only do kami provide game-changing special powers, they can be called upon to sacrifice themselves in kamikaze attacks that inflict massive damage (crab bosses beware). Each time you activate a kami power, though, you must draw a shrine card.

The catch: Some (or sometimes none) of the Believers are left out, making them Outsiders. Each Believer then submits what they recall of the Rite, such as the chants, the time of day, the food for the feast, or even the special shapes, smells, or colors. Once each Believer has helped remember the Rite, an accusation occurs: Can each Believer point out an Outsider? Can the Outsiders fake their way through it and guess the topic? In the end, only the most confident, creative, and devout among the Believers will be declared the winner and Master of Ceremonies of the Sacred Rites.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You will not act out your character's actions, you will not need to adhere to any in-game moral code or class restrictions, and you will not need to keep your out-of-game knowledge separate from your in-game knowledge. On your turns, simply dictate your actions, and they come to pass. Utilize secret actions, your supernatural powers, the resources of your vast agency, and superior planning to gain an advantage and be the first to complete your objective.<br/><br/>Power Play: Schemes &amp; Skulduggery is underhanded, unrestricted supervillainy in a free-form, open environment.

In short, they'll do almost anything for nuts &ndash; and since you are a squirrel in Nuts!, you must now be as equally nut-crazed.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player receives one nut card &ndash; which come in values 1-5, with a single 7 pointer &ndash; and five cards from the play deck. The play cards go in your hand, and the nut is placed face up on the table in front of you. Play cards come in four types:<br/><br/>&bull; Grab cards let you grab a nut from another player's stash in various ways, for example, &quot;Grab any one nut card worth 4 or less.&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; Defense cards can prevent your nuts from being grabbed, e.g., &quot;Stop someone from grabbing one of your nuts.&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; Mayhem cards are bad things that can happen, e.g., &quot;Choose two other players. They must both miss their next turn.&quot;<br/><br/>&bull; Antics cards are ways that things do not go as planned when grabbing nuts, e.g., &quot;Draw the top card of the nut deck and put it in your stash.&quot;<br/><br/>On a turn, you first reveal the top nut card and add it to your stash. Then you play one Grab, Mayhem or Antics card on another player; that player may play a Defend card to possibly prevent your action. Instead of playing a card, you can discard any number of cards from your hand, then draw replacements from the play deck. As soon as someone has more than 20 points worth of nuts, the game ends and this player wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Corporate wars, shadow ops, cranial jacks, cyber-augmentations&hellip; you&rsquo;ve been here before. You know how this goes.<br/><br/>But familiarity breeds sloppiness and sloppiness will get you dead with a capital &lsquo;P&rsquo; for Permanent. So you&rsquo;ve got no excuses. You have a team, you have a boss, and that boss just gave you a job.<br/><br/>Take whatever you need: weapons, micro-drones, dark-ware, pharma-derms, stealth gear... Just get it done. Because the particulars may change but the bottom line is the same: bring the package back or don&rsquo;t come back at all. Welcome to New Kowloon, 2069. Now get to work.<br/><br/><br/>            <br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Exploit Zero - Cyberpunk Espionage and Mayhem.<br/><br/>A table top war game set during the Corporate Wars of 2069 in the mega-city of New Kowloon.  Miniatures agnostic.<br/><br/>1 - 6 Players, Co-op or Solo Mode. Made for 15mm - 28mm miniatures.<br/><br/>Grab your friends, create a team of elite Agents, and select a mission. It's time to run-n-gun.<br/><br/>Exploit Zero uses four types of polyhedral dice: D4, D6, D8, and D10. The D4 Die is used exclusively for H-SEC spawning at the game&rsquo;s Arrival Locations. The D6, D8 and D10 are used in game to determine the success of a model&rsquo;s actions. For Agents, these three dice constitute their Dice Pool. These dice are used over the course of the Agent&rsquo;s activation to attempt Actions and the Dice Pool is renewed every turn. The die types can be used in any order the player desires, however each type can only be used once.<br/><br/>THE DICE POOL, ACTIONS, AND DIMINISHING POSSIBILITIES<br/>Except for special circumstances, Agents are allowed Three (3) Actions per Phase. The Target Number to perform an Action successfully is a 4+. To act, simply declare the intended Action (Move, Shoot, Activate CAP, etc) select one of the die types in the Dice Pool and try for a 4+, accounting for modifiers and penalties. Every 4+ is a Success. Less is a Failure.<br/><br/>To represent the stress and diminishing possibilities in a tense, frenetic combat situation, each Die Type can only be used once. One chance with a D10, one with a D8, and one with a D6. That&rsquo;s it. Although Specialization Protocols permit an Agent to roll two of a given die type in certain circumstances, the Die Type can only be used once per AGENT PHASE. In either case, once the Agent&rsquo;s Dice Pool is depleted, they can no longer act that Game Turn. This means Agents must prioritize their intended actions and allocate whichever Die Type they feel gives them the best chance at success. Die types do not have to be used in any particular order.<br/><br/>TWO DICE BONUS<br/>Most action rolls are attempted with a single die type, however certain Agents stand a better chance at succeeding at certain Actions, ones linked to their Specialization Protocol. Depending on their SP, Agents can roll TWO dice of a particular type and choose the best result when attempting certain actions. This &lsquo;Two Dice&rsquo; bonus also applies to activating those specific Combat Augmentation Programs related to their area of expertise.<br/><br/>All this really means is that while all Agents can attempt any Action or try to activate a CAP, a Razor is far more deadly in a Close Combat situation, and when it comes to hijacking the Cerberus security drone that just stomped into the room, you&rsquo;ll be thanking the Dark Net loa you&rsquo;ve got a decent Splicer at your side.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Eighteen hunters seek the last hare in Bavaria. They never hit the hare, but do manage to shoot each <br/>other ...<br/><br/>Comes in a cardboard tube with a vinyl board inside. The wooden hunters have colored hats to denote their hunting clubs. There is also a wooden hare and a wooden bush.<br/><br/>The hare is placed in the center of the hexagonally shaped board, and the hunters around the edges. <br/>The board is eleven spaces across, from one point of the hexagon to its opposite, so none of the hunters<br/>start very close to the hare. Each player draws a club card, denoting which color hunters are his own. This<br/>is kept secret from the other players. The first player then rolls the dice and the game begins.<br/><br/>The 6-side dice are labeled Blank, 1, 2, 2, 3, and 4. If a 2,3 are rolled, for example, the player whose turn it is decides whether that means he moves two hunters up to three spaces each, or three hunters up to two spaces each. For one movement point, a hunter can either move one space directly forward (they all have little rifles which should point to one space at all times - that's the only direction they can shoot or move) or it can rotate 60 degrees. A player can move a hunter of any color he chooses - no one knows which hunters are whose, and since the object is to shoot all the opponents' hunters and not your own, you don't necessarily want to move your own, anyway. Except maybe to throw the others off track about which color is yours ...<br/><br/>When all movement is done, check to see if any hunter is aiming at the hare. If so, roll the dice again, this time adding the numbers together to see how far a shot goes. If you get blank, blank, a gun blows up (remove a hunter). If you shoot far enough to hit the hare exactly, it blithely moves out of the way instead of being hit. If you roll the exact distance between two hunters, they shoot each other (if both aiming at the hare -- otherwise, only the one not aiming at the hare is shot) - remove the hunters. If you roll a number greater than the distance between two hunters, one of them dies - take your pick.<br/><br/>",

Recently, you find yourself in the back room of Rasmuson's Bookshop in the heart of Easley by the River. There, on shelves heavy with dust, you find a leather bound volume and from between its pages a letter drops. Its author describes a fabled ancient brass clock and navigation device, the Antikythera, whose 6 parts were disassembled and hidden in the city of Val Justinia to prevent it from falling into the hands of a shadowy cabal operating within the S.C.E's very halls. The letter goes on to say that if the cabal and its allies, the Federation of Air Pirates, were to discover this device, they could wreak untold havoc, potentially circumnavigate the globe and attack Arkady&rsquo;s eastern border.<br/><br/>At first you dismiss this letter as rumor and hoax but rumors have a way of sometimes becoming truth...<br/><br/>Clockwork Cabal is a game for one player lasting about 20 minutes. You win by locating all 6 parts of the Antikytheria before time runs out.<br/><br/>Required to play:<br/>1 player pawn<br/>1d12<br/>13 small eurocubes<br/>and the deck of 54 cards<br/><br/>there are 3 types of cards in the deck:<br/><br/>City Sector cards form the map of the city that you move across during the game.

        "description": "Mazescape is a clever and fascinating maze game for one player that will challenge even the most active minds.  The Cryo-C version is designed by Pablo C&eacute;spedes and Victor Hugo Cisternas, authors of Tesoros del Rey Pirata, and illustrated by David Yuyo Correa.<br/><br/>When the mainframe computer of the supply ship unexpectedly awakens from suspended animation, something&rsquo;s probably going to go wrong.  You&rsquo;re still in outer space, there&rsquo;s nobody by your side, and the central reactor&rsquo;s alarm won&rsquo;t stop sounding.  Upon exiting your capsule you realize that everyone else has disappeared.  Who, or better yet, what has taken them?  To find out, sharpen your wits, patience and powers of observation.<br/><br/>The Mazescape saga introduces a completely unique concept that fans of logic and puzzles will love.  In this original game from Devir, you will place a map on the table and look for the compass rose as the starting point of the maze.  Using the wooden stylus that comes with the game, you&rsquo;ll trace the white pathways, maintaining contact with the maze at all times, and you&rsquo;ll open and close sections of the map while looking for the exit point of the Impossible Triangle.  Pass under bridges, climb staircases, and keep your head from spinning until the exit point takes you to the next scenario.<br/><br/>Each Mazescape box contains seven different challenges to face.  The first maze is a relatively accessible challenge, and little by little the mazes become increasingly difficult until the final elegant explosion of pathways, which can only be untangled by the sharpest minds.<br/><br/>Moreover, each map includes a series of secondary challenges that allow you to travel through a second time, giving each set of maps a high degree of re-playability.  Look for all of the hidden treasures in the seven maps.  And the portable format is easy to play anywhere; all you need is a place to set the map and the stylus to start your journey.  But beware, nobody said that escaping from the labyrinth would be easy!<br/><br/>Mazescape Cryo-C offers the most advanced challenges of the Mazescape saga, including the most complex mazes to date.  Are you up for the challenge?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Some have called it the most crucial campaign of the Second World War.  It was not fought on the ground with tanks and artillery; it was the Battle of the Atlantic, pitting the German Wolfpacks versus the allied convoy system. Upon the result of the campaign hung the fate of Great Britain, and, by extension, the Allied cause in Europe.<br/><br/>&quot;Atlantic Wolves&quot; is a solitaire wargame based on this important World  War II naval campaign. It covers the decisive part of the campaign,  August 1942 to May 1943. The player, assuming the role of Admiral Karl Doenitz, controls the German Kriegsmarine and tries to achieve success against the Allies, played by the game system. The game is a deluxe re-implementation of Gary Graber's classic wargame Battle of the Atlantic, now out of print.<br/><br/>The map is a representation of the general locations where the Battle of the Atlantic was fought. There are seven named Areas on the board (e.g. Eastern Seaboard, Newfoundland, North Atlantic, Mid- Atlantic, Iceland, Bay of Biscay, and African Coast).<br/><br/>Counters in the game represent German U-Boats, &ldquo;Milch Cow&rdquo; (Milk Cow) submarine tankers, ACE, Condor bombers, Surface Raiders, and Admirals Doenitz and Raeder. Also represented are Allied Escorts, Air Patrols, Convoys, and various markers. Each U-Boat counter (in the rules, simply termed &ldquo;U-Boat&rdquo;) represents 4&ndash;6 operational U-Boats.<br/><br/>Victory is won by the German player sinking Allied ships and avoiding the establishment of a secure &ldquo;lifeline&rdquo; to Britain. The more tonnage sunk, the better for the Germans.<br/><br/>The German wins the game by fulfilling three requirements:<br/><br/><br/>    Preserving the fleet. If, during any turn, one-half or more of the U-Boat counters that started the turn are sunk, Kriegsmarine morale is broken, the game ends, and the Allies win. Example: During the first turn, if three or more U-Boats are sunk the Allies win.<br/>    Preventing a &ldquo;lifeline&rdquo; to Britain from being established. If there are four Convoy markers on the board at the end of any turn, a permanent lifeline to Britain has been established, Kriegsmarine morale is broken, the game ends, and the Allies win.<br/>    Sinking Allied ships. The German must sink 600,000 tons for three consecutive turns AND average: 400,000+ tons for the entire game if there are no Convoy markers on the board at the end of the game; OR 450,000+ tons if there is one Convoy marker on the board at the end of the game; OR 500,000+ tons if there are two or more Convoy markers on the board at the end of the game.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;Description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

If the player rolls one of the two colors assigned to the boat, he removes one of the river segments, thereby moving the boat closer to the fish; if one of the fish colors is rolled, that fish moves one space closer to the sea. If the boat moves onto a fish, it catches that fish; if a fish reaches the sea, it escapes and can't be captured. The game ends when all the fish escape or are caught.

Lay out fences that show the numbers 2-6, then shuffle Farmer Benno into the bottom of the deck. Each player takes a colored die, with all the white dice being placed in the center of the table.<br/><br/>On a turn, reveal the top card from the deck, then place it under the fence showing the matching die number. You then choose to either STOP and take a white die from the reserve, or HOP and try to make it over a fence. Choose one of the fences (2-6), then roll your colored die and as many white dice as you wish from your supply. If any die shows a value equal to or higher than the fence, you claim all of the vegetable cards under this fence, then return all of the white dice you rolled to the reserve. If you fail, keep all of the dice you rolled.<br/><br/>When Farmer Benno is revealed, the end of the game nears, with no more cards being added to the fences. Keep playing until all of the revealed cards have been claimed, then score your holdings. If you have the majority of a vegetable type, e.g., eggplant, which has 12 cards, then you score points equal to the number of cards of that type: 12 points for eggplants! Anyone else who has eggplants scores 1 point per card they have. (Ties are friendly for majorities.)<br/><br/>Whoever scores the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Les Guerres du Roi Soleil 1667-1713 (The Wars of the Sun King) is the first opportunity to play, with a single set of rules, the five conflicts led by France under the reign of Louis XIV the Great.<br/><br/>The War of Devolution (1667-1668) - Spain&rsquo;s non-payment of the Infanta of Spain&rsquo;s dowry at her marriage to Louis XIV was used as a pretext for a war of conquest. This was the first conflict initiated by Louis XIV against a militarily and economically weakened Spain.<br/><br/>The Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678) - France wants to bring the Dutch Republic to its knees. This fierce commercial competitor, too tolerant as a state, opposes France&rsquo;s expansion toward the Spanish Netherlands. This war for glory pitches against each other living legends of the Thirty Years War like Turenne, Cond&eacute; et Montecuccoli. As a result of this conflict, the King of France earns the nickname Louis the Great.<br/><br/>The War of the Reunions (1683-1684) - Spain does not accept the annexation by France of enclaves and surrounding areas in the Spanish Netherlands, stating their boundaries were poorly defined by the international treaties ending the War of Devolution and the Franco-Dutch War. Vauban recommends limiting the territorial enclaves, leaning against the mountainous area and securing the enclaves by constructing strongholds; it&rsquo;s a matter of turf.<br/><br/>The War of the League of Augsburg (1688-1697) - The Habsburg&rsquo;s victory against the Ottomans diverted the Empire&rsquo;s attention on the French territorial gains following the War of the Reunions. In 1687, Louis XIV wanted to transform the Truce of Ratisbon into a permanent accord and send an ultimatum to the emperor who refused. The German princes and the great European powers form an alliance to counter France&rsquo;s politics of expansionism and religious persecution. France finds itself diplomatically isolated.<br/><br/>The War of Spanish Succession (1701-1713) - King Charles II of Spain dies with no descendants. The two principal reigning families of Europe, the Bourbons (France) and the Habsburgs (Austria), are both related to Charles II and claim the throne. The principal stake is the domination of Europe by seizing the enormous heritage of the Spanish Habsburgs.

In Res Publica: 2230AD, the players travel to the future, when races migrate through space searching for new areas in which to settle. Intensive trading brings together strong Races, encourages new settlements and promotes the development of civilization.<br/><br/>Each turn is divided in three different phases: Trade, Display and Draw cards. Each player at his turn can make a trade offer and each player in turn responds in kind. Using the cards through trading and drawing players work to acquire five identical race cards in order to build a Space Station (which increases the number of cards you can draw each turn) or five identical technology cards in order to build a City (which gives Victory Points). A variant play has been created in this game where each player, owns a planet divided in four different missions. If a mission is accomplished, more Victory Points are added to the sum and if a player completes all missions game ends.<br/><br/>Aside the set collection and trading mechanisms, you will discover some extra cards in the game. New buildings with different abilities that either allow you to build a City displaying four technology cards, or give you extra Victory Points. At the end of the game, players total the points collected and the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Map features significant land and water routes used in the period.  Inset maps are included for high seas naval movement and tactical battle resolution.  176 two-sided mounted and die-cut counters represent regular and militia, Indians, fortresses and fleets.<br/><br/>Reinforcements from Europe are variable depending on naval activity.  Militia must be &quot;mustered,&quot; and &quot;go home&quot; at the end of each campaign year.  Natives are influenced by &quot;gifts and supplies&quot; and by battlefield victories.  Road, Indian trail and Water movement all have key roles in operations.<br/><br/>Battles occur between opposing forces occupying the same point.  Engagements take place on an inset map determined by terrain and situation: &quot;Attacking/Defending Fort,&quot; &quot;Open Ground,&quot; &quot;Wood&quot; (forested) or &quot;Landing.&quot;  Modifiers apply depending on whether engaged units are Regulars, Militia, or Indians, Rangers and Couriers de Bois.  Units engaging in battle line up opposite one another.  A &quot;hit&quot; is determined by a D6 roll of &quot;6.&quot;  Die rolls are modified according to unit type and battle setting (Regulars defending a fort, for example, are &quot;plus 2&quot;, hitting on a four or better).  All units, except Iroquois, are flipped on the first hit and eliminated on the second.  At the start of his/her battle turn, a player may elect to &quot;retreat&quot; in lieu of firing.  Retreating units move to an adjacent friendly point, preferably toward their Base of Operations.  At the end of a victorious battle, flipped pieces are turned back to full strength, and one victorious militia unit, if present, may be &quot;promonted&quot; to a Regular or Ranger (British) or a &quot;Troop of the Marine battalion&quot; or &quot;Courier de Bois&quot; (French).<br/><br/>Fortresses can be built; Towns and Fortresses can be burned.  Supply is critical at the end of a campaign year; all Regular and militia units must occupy either a town or fort, or is not connected by a red road (not trail).  They  must be able to trace supply by road or waterway to their Base of Operations (Montreal or Quebec for the French; Boston, New York or Philadelphia for the British).  Regular or militia units which fail these conditions are eliminated unless they are in a seaport.<br/><br/>The powerful Iroquois Nation is key to victory.  Three of the six Iroquois tribes begin aligned with each side (the counters are two-sided).  After each battle, the victor of that battle flips one Iroquois unit to his/her side.  Any time a player begins his/her turn with all six tribes oriented to his/her side, the Iroquois have joined him/her for the duration.<br/><br/>The other twenty tribes are activated to support the French either by the activities of the Couriers de Bois, or by French bribes (&quot;gifts and supplies&quot;).  Except for the Iroquois, Native tribes usually &quot;go home&quot; after a victory (to celebrate).<br/><br/>Victory is determined by conquest.  The French must begin a turn, or end the game, holding Albany and one of New York, Boston or Philadelphia, or must deny the British their victory conditions.  The British must hold a total of three French cities from the list of Louisbourg, Frontenac, Duquesne, Montreal or Quebec (at least one must be Montreal or Quebec).<br/><br/>",

The clans of different mafia families fight each other in... let&rsquo;s say - Naples!<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s all about honor, betrayal, contraband, theft! Every player is a member of one mafia family. However, it does not matter if you are a don or a henchman, a bookie or a snitch, a consigliere or a man of honour, nobody really has got a plan of what is going on. Who belongs to which family? Who wants to kill whom? Well, nobody knows, since there is only one code to follow: the code of silence - the OMERT&Agrave;!<br/><br/>Omert&agrave; - Clan ohne Plan is a card game for 4 to 9 players where one can interact constantly: No waiting between turns! In fact, the game really takes place, when it&rsquo;s NOT your turn. Deal cards to your opponents and family members either in a rather clandestine way when nobody is looking or take a more straightforward approach - you decide. Each player then plays out the cards dealt to him when it&rsquo;s his turn &ndash; they can make him either richer or poorer, endanger his life or see the identities of other players. He may then choose whether to take three white cards (offensive), two black cards (defensive) or whether to try to bribe the other players. After that his turn ends and he can again start dealing cards and &quot;make them offers they can&rsquo;t refuse&quot;.<br/><br/>Think tactically: Combine different action cards to manipulate and enhance effects!<br/>Cooperate: Bribe your opponents, help your don and get rid of the rest.<br/>Bluff: Every action is performed secretly. Nobody knows who you are or what you are up to...<br/>Change the game: Everyone is playing a different character, for example a consigliere or the bookie. Choose the combination of characters handed out beforehand to change the game entirely!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The trick-taking game Tricky Dungeon is played with 15 different hero cards and a 32 card deck that consists of 8 cards in 4 suits. The hero cards are offered in 3 different languages: English, German and Dutch. The playing cards are language independant and are valued 0 to 7. The cards with value 3 and 4 in each suit are magical spells. Each suit also has one card marked as a potion, the value being different in each suit. These special cards offer special gameplay effects, depending on which hero is chosen in a round. The other playing cards show typical dungeon inhabitants. These become relevant with a few heroes that are in the game.<br/><br/>Players compete over multiple rounds to accumulate the most gold and the player who ends up with the most gold wins the game. There are 3 sets of 5 unique heroes and each game a set of 5 heroes is chosen to play with. Every round one of the players acts as the active player and has to choose one of 5 available heroes. Each hero changes the game and describes how gold is earned. All the other players have to cooperate and try to stop the active player from reaching this goal.<br/><br/>The active player chooses the hero to play with after the playing cards are dealt. In a 4 player game each player receives 7 cards. The remaining 4 cards are set aside. After the active player has chosen the hero for the round, that player may exchange up to 4 cards from hand with the remaining cards. In a 2 and 3 player game each player is dealt 9 cards and 5 cards are set aside and available for exchanging.<br/><br/>Each hero determines the goal for the active player how gold can be earned. This can be a scaling amount of gold. For example if a player chooses the Barbarian gold is earned for every collected trick and potion card above a certain threshold. Some heroes offer a fixed amount of gold. For example, if a player chooses the Assassin, 4 gold is earned if the active player wins the final trick of the round. When the active player did not manage to earn any gold, all other players are rewarded for their good cooperation by earning 1 gold each. Some heroes change the game in other ways, for example playing cards without revealing them or making use of the set aside cards during a round.<br/><br/>The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. The first played card of a trick determines the suit that is asked. Other players must follow suit, if they can. In general the player who played highest card of the suit that is requested, wins the trick. Some heroes add trump cards that round, this can be a suit, one of the special cards (magical spells, potions) or even a specific number. If one or more trump cards is played in a trick, the highest trump wins the trick. Each suit is ranked (1 to 4), if multiple trump cards of the same value are played (e.g. multiple 4's with a hero in play that makes them trump), the higher ranked suit wins the trick.<br/><br/>The three sets of five heroes each offer a range of options for players. Starting players are recommended to play with set A first. Sets B and C offering more tricky heroes to play with. Besides these three unique set of hero options, the game also suggests a few variants to increase variability. Instead of playing 2 rounds per player the 'Adventurer's Guild' variant forces players to play once with each of the five heroes that game as an active player. Another variant, 'Random Dungeon', shuffles all the 15 heroes together and the active player is offered 1 hero at random to choose to play with. Up to two times this hero can be refused an a new hero is revealed.<br/><br/>",

For the most part, 3 Man Chess is played just like conventional Chess. &ndash; there was NEVER any intention of trying to make the game &ldquo;better&rdquo; because that can&rsquo;t be done. However, being able to play with three minds interacting creates situations that never arise in conventional Chess.<br/><br/><br/>     3 Man Chess&rsquo; circular game board consists of 6 concentric ranks of 24 files and an open central &ldquo;void&rdquo; that pieces may pass, but not stop on. There are teardrop shaped curves drawn on the board to help diagonal moves navigate the &ldquo;void.&rdquo;<br/>     3 Man Chess uses conventional chess teams (three of them!) &ndash; 16 pieces that follow all of their traditional rules; 8 pawns start on rank #2 protecting 2 rooks, 2 knights, 2 bishops, a queen and a king which start on rank #1 (the outermost rank).<br/>     The teams are separated from each other by &ldquo;moats&rdquo; and &ldquo;creeks&rdquo; that are impassable at the start of the game.<br/>     Diagonal moves follow the drawn guidelines, passing across the center to the opposite &ldquo;spoke.&rdquo;<br/>     Straight moves may also pass across the central &ldquo;void,&rdquo; or move around the circular ranks.<br/>     After just a couple of turns around the board, strategy becomes intensely complex and fascinating! An unexpected move might well result in a cascading massacre. Defense is crucial since a diagonal move through the center, or a horizontal move around the center can sneak up behind you. Your two opponents can team up to checkmate you, or ultimately you can checkmate both of them at the same time!<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Legends and Lies each player is a Cryptozoologist mounting expeditions in an attempt to prove the existence of certain unknown creatures such as Bigfoot, The Loch Ness Monster or Extraterrestrials.  Each ultimately hopes to gain fame and fortune by being credited with the actual discovery of a new species.  While searching the globe for solid proof of these creatures existence each Cryptozoologist can attempt to discredit their competitor&rsquo;s discoveries by leaking wild stories to the tabloid press.  Turnabout is, of course, fair play&hellip;.<br/><br/>Basic Game Play Overview:<br/> During each turn players draw from either the Unknown (draw pile) or from the top of Tabloids (discard pile). Each player creates or adds to melds using Expedition cards in order to reach ten or more points. If ten or greater points is achieved that expedition would be considered to have found enough proof for science to take notice, thereby doubling that set's score. Also during each turn a single Anomaly card (action card) may be played which can do things like strengthen the value of an expedition in play, retrieve cards from the Tabloids, discredit other players expeditions or manipulate other facets of the game. At the end of a round, cards in the Tabloids that match expeditions in play discredit that expedition. The game also has a shut-out rule involving Extraterrestrials that, if achieved, prevents all other players from scoring that round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rules for wargaming the Late Nineteenth Century with historical miniatures. Bloody Big Battles! (BBB) does exactly what its title says. It is intended for fighting the biggest, bloodiest battles of 1850-1900 in a manageable way. Specific design goals included:<br/>to tackle the major battles such as Solferino, Gettysburg, K&ouml;niggr&auml;tz, Sedan or Plevna, often spanning several days&rsquo; combat;<br/>to fit them on a 6&rsquo;x4&rsquo; tabletop;<br/>and to fight them in their entirety, in a single 3-to-4-hour session, with 2-6 players (typically 4).<br/><br/>BBB is not intended for small actions of a few thousand men a side. There are plenty of rulesets that do that. But BBB is distinctive in:<br/>Enabling players to command entire armies of 100,000+ men;<br/>Fitting battlefields of up to 20km across on the table;<br/>While still producing a fast, fun, flavorful game and a result in an evening.<br/><br/>Scale varies according to the battle but is typically:<br/>Figure scale 1,500 men or 36 cannon per 1&rdquo; base (organized into multi-base division or brigade-sized units, usually of 3-7 infantry bases, 2-3 cavalry bases or 1 artillery base);<br/>Ground scale 1&rdquo; per 200-250 yards;<br/>Timescale 1 hour per turn.<br/><br/>BBB uses simple mechanisms and memorisable tables that fit on a clear 2-page QRC.<br/>Turn sequence: IGO-UGO<br/>Command and Control: reflected partly by how many generals get represented on table, partly by how units are rated.<br/>Movement: 2D6 movement table incorporates difficult terrain, generalship and doctrine, troop quality and morale, loss recovery.<br/>Fire Combat: calculated by adding fire points. 2D6 fire table to determine casualties, recorded by base removal.<br/>Assault: opposed D6 roll incorporating a few relevant factors.<br/>Night Interval rules to allow multi-day battles.<br/><br/>BBB is meant for fighting historical battles. BBB and its companion volume, Bloody Big European Battles, therefore provide fully playtested scenarios for 25 of the most important battles of the period, linked into full campaigns. Further free scenarios are also available on the web.<br/><br/>All the scenarios fit the battles they depict into a beautiful, tightly engineered game structure. They have clear, simple, but carefully thought-out victory conditions, designed both to recreate the historical situation and to generate an exciting and balanced game that can be completed in a sensible period of time. A particular joy of fighting historical actions on this scale is that usually both sides have several different viable strategies available, meaning the scenarios are full of replay value and can produce quite different games each time.<br/><br/>",

Planning for the operation began shortly after the failure of the Sinyavino Offensive. The German defeat in the Battle of Stalingrad in late 1942 had weakened the German front. By January 1943, Soviet forces were planning or conducting offensive operations across the entire German-Soviet front, especially in southern Russia, Iskra being the northern part of the wider Soviet 1942&ndash;1943 winter counter offensive<br/><br/>The city of Leningrad, second largest in the USSR, had been cut off by the Germans since September 8, 1941. Now, sixteen months later, the Soviets were about to make their third attempt to relieve the city. The first attack in January 1942 had led to the mauling of the 2nd Shock Army in the swamps to the south, and a second failure between Sinyavino and Mga in the summer of 1942 had also taken heavy casualties, although it had completely derailed von Manstein's planned assault on the city itself. Now in January of 1943 the Red Army was set to try again.<br/><br/>Uses the same game system rules as the following Clash of Arms Games wargames, the award winning Black Sea Black Death, Aachen and Borodino '41.<br/><br/>The game is set in a frozen peat bog, bordered by a frozen lake and a frozen river, is a slugging match. German fortified lines cut through the snow filled woods and encircle the worker's settlements and the critical Sinyabino Heights.<br/><br/>The Red Army appears for the most part in regiment sized units of riflemen, artillery and heavy mortars, backed up by battalions of tanks (half of them light T-60s), skiers, marines, engineers, as well as by naval artillery, air power, and a few odd units like aerosans and observation balloons.<br/><br/>The Germans have most of their units in infantry and artillery battalions, backed up by companies of Tiger and Pzkw.III tanks, deadly 88mm flak guns, and STUG IIIs. The Germans also field everything from a battalion of Spanish fascists to a railroad battery. They also field battalions of heavy artillery, nebelwerfers, and captured French coastal guns, as well as mountain troops, jaegers, the SS Polizei Division, and several overstrength independent regiments plus their Tiger tanks (here seen in their debut performance).<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: Impulses = 4-5 hours, 5-6 impulses per day<br/>Hex: 880 yards / 804 meters<br/>Units: Company to Regiment<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full-color mapsheets<br/>Three dual-side printed countersheets (2 combat, 1 markers - 620 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 32-page Operation Spark rules booklet<br/>Six Player Aid cards<br/>Two 10-sided dice<br/><br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-20 hours<br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: Moderate<br/><br/>",

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionIn Mr. Card Game, you are Mr. Card Game, cousin to the (internet) famous Mr. Adventurer, the hero of the Kingdom of Loathing. Mr. Card Game is a rule-breaking, cross-classing monster killer on a tabletop quest to free King Ralph XI from the Naughty Sorceress. As you and your fellow tabletop adventurers chart a course through the Kingdom of Loathing, whoever buys the right skills, acquires the best stats and can take down the Naughty Sorceress first wins the game and the right to lord it over his or her friends (friends not included with game).<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDescriptionMr. Card Game is the official tabletop game of the massive multiplayer online game Kingdom of Loathing. With a mixture of deck-building mechanics and tableau management, Mr. Card Game is a fantasy adventure themed character building card game for 2 to 5 players ages 13 and up which plays in less than an hour.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSynopsisEach player begins with a deck of one point stats and a set of basic newbie gear. On your turn, you have the opportunity to select one of the monsters on top of the location draft piles to kill. By defeating a monster, you receive a new item (displayed on the reverse side of the monster card) to add to your tableau, a new stat card to add to your deck and meat tokens you can use on subsequent turns to draft skills. Once one or more of the players thinks they have accumulated enough power from killing monsters, upgrading stats and training skills to defeat the Naughty Sorceress, they may call a March of the Tower where all players have an opportunity to kill her together. They player with the highest power and enough to kill the Sorceress, wins.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tStrategyThe gameplay in Mr. Card Game is a hybrid of deck building and tableau management. Mr. Card Game is a game of drafting, not only drafting items and skills, but also the stat cards necessary to use those items and skills most effectively. You want to plot a course through the locations in the game which maximizes the synergy of the skill and item cards you draft into your tableau with the stat cards you draft into your deck. All the while managing your level of meat, the currency of the realm you acquire from killing monsters, which you need to purchase the skills which make you better. Tactically, the game relies upon your management of your tableau, when to use or sell items, and how effectively you craft the hand of cards necessary to defeat your target or perhaps even win the game.<br/><br/>",

Each card functions like a deck in a traditional CCG, where each Gear is a separate hand. And much like decks in a CCG, each card rewards different strategies and play styles.<br/><br/>Players take turns attacking or shifting their cards to another Gear. To use a Gear's Modifier, you might have to pay a cost; costs may require flipping a coin, or paying spirit - which is earned by taking damage.

It is logical in its associations and what it chooses to make important in terms of combat. It places a premium on good, sound tactics. This is not a game where players sit back and shoot at each other from across the table top. Victory has everything to do with the choices you make on the table.<br/><br/>Learn to think tactically. Suppress and move. Maintain squad discipline, but control the table. Create firing lanes and punish those who move through it. Combat begins and ends with movement. Everyone can shoot; survivors know when to shoot and when to relocate.<br/><br/>Each MegaCon plays extremely different, having intrinsic strengths and weaknesses. Learn them, then create tactics and adapt in the flow of battle to take advantage of the MegaCon you play.<br/><br/>If you learn to marry solid tactics with MegaCon strengths, then perhaps you can call yourself a MERCS player.<br/><br/>MERCS 2.0 streamlines many of the dice and modifier interactions that exist in the game. It introduces new reference cards, keywords, initiative, and medium range.

        "description": "Swamped is a semi-cooperative game of adventure, peril and treasure in which players move through a swamp searching for a rare herb that can cure diseases. Each player takes a turn steering the boat to find the herb. But the swamp has many other treasures as well, so players may try to steer the boat away from its intended goal to increase their own wealth.<br/><br/>Swamped is a game for 2-4 adventurers that plays in about 30 minutes and expands the vibrant world of Antidote. In addition to a one-of-a-kind theme, there are five core elements that make Swamped incredibly fun and a surprisingly unique gaming experience:<br/><br/>1. Player-shared pieces: All players share ownership of the same tiny boat in the swamp, so the actions of any one player impact every other player directly.<br/><br/>2. Secret and shared objectives: Everyone knows the main objective, but each player also has a hidden goal that might lead the whole expedition into deadly peril!<br/><br/>3. Player controlled game-length: Players can speed-up or slow-down the game down depending on their preference. Some will try to get out of the swamp quickly, while others will delay until they've collected precisely the right combination of treasures.<br/><br/>4. Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty who has won the game before each player's secret objective is revealed, leading to an exciting reveal at the very end!<br/><br/>5. Efficient use of physical components: Despite its small size (35 cards and two pieces), most cards have multiple uses and orientations leading to a surprisingly deep set of decisions each player can make. Furthermore, as players move deeper into the swamp, the swamp expands from the action card deck, opening up greater adventure, while at the same time triggering a built-in game timer.<br/><br/>",

These cards indicate which categories of items are worth extra for you, and you will most likely share a category with another player.  At the beginning of each round (called an episode), players draw item tokens, look at them (without revealing them to the other players}, and discreetly place them into any of the four storage lockers at the center of the table.  Next, players bid on the lockers one at a time.  Do you bid on what you know or try for unseen treasure?  When all four lockers have been claimed, players reveal what they've won, or lost.

        "description": "The story of the Picrocholine Wars is one of the most well-known passages of the novel Gargantua, written by Fran&ccedil;ois Rabelais in 1534. Using a brawl between shepherds and millers as a pretext, Picrochole, King of Lerne, declared war on Gargantua's father, Grandgousier. A model of the enlightened monarch of the Renaissance, Grandgousier attempted to avert war by all means. But Picrochole, taking this as a sign of Grandgousier's weakness, invaded his neighbor's kingdom. Grandgousier calls upon his son, and Gargantua, at the head of an army of his loyal companions, inflicts a humiliating defeat on Picrochole, who flees on the back of a donkey.<br/><br/>The Picrocholine Wars simulates this celebrated episode of French literature through a fun and simple wargame. Players will find and discover in this game all of the events that gave the novel parodying the chivalric tomes of the era its charms: the giant Gargantua, of course, and his friends Gymnast and Fr&egrave;re Jean, but also the cheating Picrochole and his lieutenants.<br/><br/>Though it has its &quot;rabelaisien&quot; side, The Picrocholine Wars is a balanced game in which each camp has its own distinct strengths and during which players will have to adopt the role of both the attacker and the defender. The Picrocholine Wars combines gaming pleasure with culture and history, and is ideal for initiating new players into wargaming.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Odd Shop, the auction house for all your oddities! Spend store credits to win the odd objects. But be aware, not all objects are authentic. Hire the inhouse experts to get more information on the objects before you make your bid.<br/><br/>Every round, five objects will be auctioned off. All objects are visible for all the players to see. The auction will start with the object furthest on the left, continuing to the object on the right. For each object, a round of bidding will occur.<br/><br/>All objects have two values in gold. One value for an authentic object and one value for a replica. You will only find out if the objects are authentic or not after you&rsquo;ve bought the item. But before the bidding starts, you can hire the help of an expert to check if the object(s) is authentic or a replica. Bidding will happen simultaneously in the first round. After the first round, the player with the most credits left, will become the profiteer. When there is a profiteer, bidding will occur in clockwise order, with the profiteer bidding last. Bids will be placed face down, but players can see how many cards are used in the bid.<br/><br/>The objects are divided into four categories: potions, familiars, gear and magic items. When you win more objects of the same category, you gain bonus points (depending on the duration of the game). Gear objects belong to sets of two or three. When you&rsquo;ve collected a complete set, the total value of that set will be doubled. Therefore, it is encouraged to try and win as many of the same category objects as you can, but your opponents will of course know that you want certain objects. That&rsquo;s why it is allowed to trade with the other players. You can trade objects, or you can buy objects from other players by paying credits. This means that you will play the rest of the game with less credits to spend and your opponent with more than everyone else. But getting to complete a collection can win you the game!<br/><br/>You may notice that the objects are not named. You may use your expertise to identify the objects and give them names. And how on earth could some be replicas?!<br/><br/>Have fun in the world of Odd Shop!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Spring in the hight country enters with a wash of fresh green and the warming chinook, while the show still lies deep on the mountain peaks. As the snow recedes, wild flowers of every hue splash across the lush meadows of the Northern Rockies. The small life in burrow and den creep forth, the birds sing loudly in the pines. Spring is the true beginning of the new year in the awakening wilderness of the Yellowstone.<br/><br/>The old buck raises his head and turns his gaze to the horizon. The time has come - now to lead the herd to the summer pasture where the bounty of this land will drive away the hunger of winter past. But other animals have come forth from their dens with the spring - the coyote, grizzly bear, mountain lion, and the deadliest predator of all - Man. The natural dangers of this magnificent, rugged land loom ahead. Yet the herd, to prosper, must take to the well-worn trail, seeking to cross the migratory paths of the other grazing masses. As the young gambol and explore, every instinct of the old buck must be devoted to the trek. Without hesitation, he takes the first step toward the future.<br/><br/>Yellowstone is a less complex game dealing with moving your herd from Winter Pasturage to Summer Pasturage back to Winter Pasturage.  Players control one of the following herds: bison, elk, sheep, or mule deer.  Along the way, you try to pick up Food Points and avoid predators.  You can move the animals in your herd a certain number of hexes in a turn; males are the fastest, females are a bit slower, babies are really slow and should be accompanied by females.  However, when you finally get back to Winter Range, you score more for babies and females than you do for males -- so you may find it necessary to sacrifice a male or two to predators.  Predators are controlled by your opponents, but you get to control them on your turn.  They are not major threats, but inducement to keep moving.  Collect those food points!  You'll need them for winter.<br/>The game's map centers on the Yellowstone Park area and some of the land south of there.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Do you want to build a Snowman? Dig in the snow to find the items to build your very own snowman.<br/><br/>Based on the Roll-and-Write, Paleontologists, with a Winter theme.<br/><br/>Items needed: 2 six-sided dice<br/><br/>The game is played over 20 rounds, with players playing simultaneously, trying to earn the most points by digging up items in the snow. All players will use the same dice pool for each roll, using the dice however each player determines.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Each Round you will roll 2 dice and then use those dice to draw a shape with a certain dig type on the snow map. You dig up an item when it is completely surrounded (orthogonally) by shapes you have drawn.<br/><br/>- Roll 2 dice - Roll the 2 dice. Write the numbers in the top right corner on the current round&rsquo;s track. This is just used as a helpful reference. Of the two dice rolled, one will be used to determine which shape and the other die will be used to determine the type of dig.<br/><br/>- Use dice to choose a shape and a dig type<br/><br/>Choosing the shape: Using one of the dice, choose one of the pentomino shapes coordinated with that number. There are twelve shapes, with a choice of two shapes with each die-face number.<br/><br/>Choosing the dig type: Using the other die, determine the dig type. There are three dig types.<br/><br/>Example: You roll a 2 and a 5. You can choose one shape, and can choose from four shapes; the two shapes next to the 2 and the two shapes next to the 5. You also have a choice between two dig types; the V from the 2 that was rolled or the diagonal lines from the 5 that was rolled. You decide the best play for your current dig site is to choose the L shape with the 5 die and then use the V dig type with the 2 die.<br/><br/>- Draw shape and fill that shape in with the Dig type<br/>Shapes can be mirrored, turned, and flipped, as long as they are still the same shape.<br/>Shapes can only be placed in open, non-item spaces. You can place shapes over the bonus snowflake. If you do, choose and circle one of the bonuses to gain (you can use bonuses in future rounds).<br/><br/>- Check to see if you dig up an Item(s) - Once n item is completely surrounded orthogonally (up, down, left, right. Not diagonally) then you score that item! Circle the number in a lower scoring area that corresponds to the item you dug up. If you use all of the same dig type for an item, you earn bonus points.<br/><br/>Repeat these steps each round (rolling 2 dice and placing a shape with a dig type) until 20 rounds have been completed.<br/><br/>- Earning Bonus points for using the same Dig Type - if you were able to use the same dig type for an item, you also gain the scoring bonus. Circle the extra smaller circle with the +number. If there is more than one dig type used for an item, you cannot gain the bonus.<br/><br/>- Bonus Snowflakes - when you place a shape over a bonus snowflake, you gain a bonus! Choose one of the four bonuses at the top-left of the page. The four types of bonuses are One Square Anywhere, Switch Shape, Switch Dig Type, and +1 Point. Each bonus can be gained up to four times in one game.<br/><br/>One Square Anywhere - At any time, place a 1x1 square on any empty square that does not contain a bonus snowflake. Fill in the square (as the dig type). You cannot get the dig type bonus score when a filled-in square is used to dig up that item.<br/><br/>Switch Shape - Choose any shape for this round (replacing the one that you would have used)<br/><br/>Switch Dig Type - Choose any dig type for this round (replacing the one that you would have used)<br/><br/>+  1 Point - Worth one point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>End of Game: After you have completed the 20th roll/round, total your points earned from each item dug up, adding in bonuses from items dug up with the same dig type, and finally adding points if circled from bonus snowflakes. The player with the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>Build your Snowman: Take the items you dug up and place them however you would like on the blank snowman. Name your snowman and have a happy holiday!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

As the Publisher remarks, this game is ideal for beginners.<br/><br/>Every player has a set of small detailed plastic figures made up of soldiers (nine per player), tanks (five) and artillery (three per player). The map is a representation of a desert (with some dunes, mountains and roads). Every player starts at one side and in the middle there is a river dividing the desert. This river is the frontier between both players. There are three bridges symmetrically distributed on the river. In every player's territory, there are three possible objectives for the enemy: the Oasis, the Polvorin (ammunition depot) and the High Command.<br/><br/>Every player takes, at the beginning of the game, one objective card (three possible) and this is going to be his goal in the game: either introduce three units in the enemy Oasis at the other side of the river, or two units in the High Command or only one in the Polvorin (furthest objective). The shooting success is ruled by the dice and a round rotating table that gives the exact minimum dice value (between 1 to 6) needed on a throw with the dice based on the distance (in hexes) between the shooting unit and the objective unit. A user friendly wargame and easy to start playing.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Build your army. Crush your friends.<br/><br/>REINFORCEMENTS combines fun and simplicity with elements of strategy and planning. Build up your army to unlock more actions and summon the mythical totems that embody the kingdoms of the realm. Barrage your foes, Fortify your army, or Adapt to the situation at hand. Every move matters as you try to be the last Kingdom standing. Do you have what it takes?  Inspired by the classic card game War.<br/><br/>In the game you will be starting with a handful of five cards and three face-down Foundations (selected during setup). On your turn, you can do one of three things: use a card in your hand to Attack the lead card in one of your opponents &quot;stacks&quot;, Defend your foundations by adding a card that matches the suit of that foundation from your hand to the &quot;stack&quot;, or Discard as many cards from your hand as you want (you will fill back up to begin your next turn.)<br/><br/>Once you add a third card to a stack, that stack is turned face up and you draw a card from the top of the draw pile to start a new foundation. Having a faceup stack will give you a bonus depending on the suit. A faceup stack of Blue cards allows you to Fortify which lets you take an additional Defend action on your turn if you have a blue card in hand that you can place. A faceup stack of Red cards allows you to Barrage your opponent by allowing you and additional attack on your opponent each turn if you have a red card in hand. Finally, a faceup Green stack gives you the ability to Adapt by either swapping a green card from your hand with a green card from the stack or swapping the position of two of the green cards in your faceup stack.<br/><br/>Each color of stack that is face up grants you these abilities, so they can add up quickly and each color that's face up also gives you a passive ability: blue - your blue stacks may now have 4 cards instead of just 3, red - red cards that attack or Barrage automatically win all ties, green - your hand size increases by 1 for every faceup green stack in your army. Cards range in value from 1-7 and it's a basic war mechanic that higher card beats lower card, however if you win a battle (i.e. your six beats your opponents' two) any extra points carry on to the next card in the line (in the example you would have four points left to face whatever card was next in line.)<br/><br/>If there is a tie both players yell &ldquo;REINFORCEMENTS!!!&rdquo; Each player MUST yell this when a tie occurs. This rule is non negotiable. Players draw the top card off of the draw pile and flip them until the battle is resolved. There are also some special cards that truly mess things up (Assassins, Mages, and mobs of Peasants) and if you flip two stacks of one color or one stack of each color (three stacks in total) one of the Totems will visit you and provide a special power. But you have to use it before an opponent completes their requirement and steals the Totem from you.<br/><br/>",

Records for step reduction were kept on paper side records, rather than using reduced units (as in Anzio: The Struggle for Italy – 1943-1945); records for hidden movement were also kept on paper, rather than using screens to hide each player's view of the opponent's forces as in Midway.<br/><br/>The game victory conditions in the basic game were that the United States won if the Japanese were unable to hold Henderson Field for two consecutive turns between the September 25 and November 20 turns, inclusive, with the game ending on November 20 turn. The Tournament Game extended until the January 29, 1943 turn, with the point-based victory determined based on points awarded for eliminating enemy combat factors, occupying Henderson Field, or (for the Japanese) having Henderson Field in range of their artillery units.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill discontinued the game before assigning it a complexity rating; however, in the  Avalon Hill ''General'', Volume 3, Number 6, Avalon Hill assigned to the game the following characteristics:<br/><br/>     Playing Time: 2-4 hours<br/>     Play Balance: Even<br/>     Complexity: Very Complex<br/>     For Beginner: Very Poor<br/>     Play-By-Mail: Poor<br/>     Suggestion: Use of Optional Rules<br/><br/><br/>The rules were revised to a small extent in their second printing in June, 1966. These changes were described in the  Avalon Hill ''General'', Volume 3. Number 2.<br/><br/>",

The Battle of the Bulge&quot; is a card wargame for 2-4 players recreating the famous World War II battle in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region, hoping to break through to the English Channel and split the Allied Forces.  Each player controls either the German or the U.S. and British forces.  Players draw cards in each daily turn from their own decks, then play the cards as they see fit.  Many cards can be played during the opponent's turn so there is constant interaction.  Each deck is complete; there are no cards to collect or trade.  NUTS! comes in two 150-card sets (North and South).  Each set is complete and can be played on its own, or the two sets can be played together.  (From the back of the box by Decision Games)<br/><br/>The cards have actual photographs of units, events, cities, and equipment from the battle.  Cards comprise of units (infantry, artillery, mechanized), events like bad weather or supply drops, and terrain to include cities, major forest, rivers, and ridges.  Units are rated in strength values for infantry, armor, artillery, and cohesion.  The objectives are for the Germans to get three panzer units (six if playing both decks) from their start side off the Allied side of the board.  The Allies must prevent this and stall the offensive until adequate reinforcement arrival.  Although this is a card game, it plays very much like a board game.  Battles are resolved via dice rolling.  The rules do include important factors such as supply, town encirclement, weather, blitzes, cohesion checks, and the like.  Overall, an easy to medium game to grasp the rules and play.  (comments by Walt Mulder)<br/><br/>",

GARBAGE cards worth negative points, so players will try to recycle them, that is, to get rid of them. <br/>As to the CONTAINER cards, these worth positive points (from 1 to 5, in each colour), and are placed in the center of the table. These are drawn one at a time. <br/>For each CONTAINER card,  players can bet any number of cards of the correspondent colour from their hand.

Sponsor local businesses to manufacture raw goods into valuable luxury goods and sell them to local Aristocraticci for money and favor.  Compete against other families for raw goods and prime real-estate.  Do you place your new draper business in the draper quarter where it will be more profitable, or beside the campo with the beautiful statue to earn your family more prestige?  Raw goods are cheaper at the Pirate wharf, but if the Pirates get enough money, they will set sail and rob everyone's ships of their most prized goods!<br/><br/>",

Clash their personalities in fun and exciting ways to feed them kibble and win the game.<br/><br/>Kibble Scuffle is a tactical card game of area control to try to get the best food for your feline friends. With cards like the Robo-Vac and Laser Pointer, you can use toys to strategically distract your opponent's cats. Using the game box as a cat food box to store the food cubes, players take turns placing their cats and resolving their abilities. For example, the Pounce Cat removes a cat at a bowl. The Greedy Cat eats two food cubes. The Mangy Cat forces another cat to move away from their bowl. Once five cats are at any food bowl, the feeding (scoring) phase begins, followed by a new round.<br/><br/>Once a player reaches 20 points, the player with the most value of food cubes eaten at the end of the feeding phase wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An abstract game with a lovely, if austere, board, a few cards and a single moving part - the Vector.<br/>  <br/>Each player receives eight Direction (North, Northeast, etc.) and four Distance cards (0, 1, 2, 3).  The Vector starts in the middle of the board, which is ruled off in squares.  Direction cards are played face up in turn, then all players secretly select a Distance card.  These are revealed simultaneously, and the Vector moved by each player according to the Direction/Distance cards they played.  After all players have moved the Vector, a new round begins with the Vector in the current location and a new first player.<br/><br/>Many of the squares contain actions (plus/minus scoring, mandatory Vector redirects, lost turns, etc.) that are performed when the Vector ends a player's turn there.  Scores are totaled after 12 rounds of play, leveling out the advantage of being the first to move the Vector.<br/><br/>To add some tension, each player has a &quot;Goal&quot; of three squares on their side of the board.  When a goal is scored, by moving the vector into it, the player to whom the goal belongs immediately doubles their score - whether positive or negative - and the game ends.<br/><br/>As with similar blind action games (Basari, Dragon Delta, Robo Rally to name a few), astutely predicting your opponents' intent and disguising your own is the key.  It takes some analysis to determine all the possible options, but not so much as to cause paralysis.  Guessing right three times and scoring big when playing last in a round is very satisfying!  The constant surprises due to bluffs and doublethink make this a light, entertaining game.<br/><br/>",

They place two balls on each figure. They now take turns and choose one of the following three actions.<br/><br/>1.Move: Players can move the chosen piece as many squares sideways, forwards or backwards as the piece has balls, if it has 4 balls it must move 4 squares. The pieces may neither jump nor change direction.<br/><br/>2.Sharing: Players may take all the balls from a selected piece and place one each on any of their other pieces. Exception, if a tower has six balls only five balls may be placed on the other five pieces and so one ball is lost and is removed from the game.<br/><br/>3.Capturing: Only balls are captured, not pieces. The capturing piece and the threatened piece stay on their own squares. Example a white piece and a brown piece stand two squares apart. They have two balls and three balls respectively. It is whites move and white can remove the three brown balls from the game as long as there is no piece between the white and brown pieces. Pieces whose balls have been captured can be activated again by the sharing of balls.<br/><br/>Therefore, capturing only limits the movement possibilities, the number of pieces always remains the same. If a player loses all their balls they can no longer move and have lost.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns placing crates on resource-producing islands. When all the spaces on an island are full, all players with crates on that island transfer those crates to their ships. Once you have filled a ship with the required resources, you can launch it. The launched ship provides points as well as unlocking various single-use abilities.<br/><br/>Players can also place pirate crates. Pirate crates can be used to muscle in on your opponents' resources as well as activate dastardly pirate actions such as stealing resources or earning a fee each time a ship is launched.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has launched five ships. Players earn bonus points for completing public and secret objectives. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

The Nazis have completed the construction of a massive invasion fleet of flying saucers and space zeppelins, and arrive at Earth's door with only one thing in their mind: total world dominance!<br/><br/>Iron Sky: The Board Game puts players in charge of the most epic battle of all history. The objective is to gather as many victory points for your side as possible. Both the attacking and defending players are in command of a specific sector of the battlefield, and each player is awarded with a personal score based on how the battle fares &ndash; but no one commander can win the whole war. The players need to help each other out of tight spots, for each commander has a different area of expertise, with weaker proficiency in other areas. Only by working together can the players prevent the enemy from exploiting these weaknesses, and only by working together can they bring the enemy to their knees!<br/><br/>In addition to mixing cooperation with competition, the core of the gameplay ensures that the players practically have no downtime at all. You are either attacking or defending all the time, eliminating the need to wait for your turn.<br/><br/>Iron Sky: The Board Game takes a different approach to the universe of Iron Sky. The movie may focus on the main characters, but the board game gives players direct control over the whole global war effort &ndash; and there's no way of knowing which side will emerge victorious.

        "description": "Avalon is a card-based game where a line of 11 landscape cards form the board and the cards in your hand are made up of Knights and Enchantresses. There are 8 of each in each of five different colors, for a total of 80 cards, which both players share as a common draw deck.<br/><br/>The game starts with the landscapes face down, randomly assigned knights or enchantresses on each player's side of the landscape cards, and five knights/enchantresses in each players hand. In the course of the game, if you play knights on your side of the territory and you have at least as many cards on your side before playing the card, you have the option of declaring an attack with that knight. The other player has a chance to respond by defending with a knight of exactly the same color (in which case both knights are left in place). If the attacker is successful, the loser loses all of their cards from their side, and the winner loses an equal number. Then, the winner must lose an additional number of cards from their side or the hand equal to the total number of knights on both sides that were involved in the conflict. Finally, the region is turned face up with the crowns on the bottom facing toward the controlling player. You can only attack up to two landscapes per turn, but you may play as many cards as you would like to on your turn. The max hand size at the end of a round is 5. The object is to control 15 crowns at the end of your turn (number of crowns on a card ranges from 1-3).<br/><br/>Two landscape cards have special abilities - Avalon reduces your loss from battles by one once per turn, and the forest with a standing stone allows you to declare an attack on your opponent with an enchantress as if she was a knight.<br/><br/>Enchantresses normally will convert enemy knights from their side of the board to yours unless countered with a same color enchantress. The countering player receives the aggressor's attacking enchantress into his hand if he counters an enchantress.<br/><br/>When the player is done playing cards, he draws one of the 5 Light tiles or 4 Dark tiles that describe the options for replenishing cards in hand. Light tiles give you their benefit immediately, and Dark tiles give you their benefit at the beginning of your next turn. Each tile is used only once until all tiles have been used, at which point they are all available again. After drawing a replenishment tile, the player's turn is over and the game continues with the next player.<br/><br/>Avalon is part of the Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Based on the ancient game of Alley Skittles or Nine Pins -- whose American descendant is Bowling -- this game was transformed into a table-top game in the 1700's so that no throwing alley or bowling lane was needed.  The nine pins stood on a table and players took turns swinging a ball on the end of a chain so that it swung away from the playing field and then knocked down the pins on its return.<br/><br/>Since this version could be played indoors and yet saved on pub space, it has been known as Bar Skittles.  When in 1783, dragoons put down a riot (caused by a dramatic play insulting to tailors), newspapers described the dragoons as a ball going through skittles, causing the game to become known as 'Devil Amongst the Tailors'.<br/><br/>Revived as a family board game in 20th century United States, children were thought to get the hang of table-top skittles quickly and end up better than adults.  All-time PBA Bowling champion  Dick Weber endorsed the game as &quot;the next best thing to having a bowling alley in your living room&quot;.<br/><br/>",

It is used to minimize the luck factor of the dice and to help your heroes to do some really epic actions..<br/><br/>..cause this is really what Wolsung SSG is about. Action, challenge and fun are all essentials of Wolsung SSG and things we put emphasis on when designing new rules, miniatures or terrains.<br/><br/>Source: Publisher Blurb<br/><br/>Wolsung SSG is miniature skirmish wargame, which uses 28mm miniatures, dice and standard dec of cards. During game players try to defeat their opponents, or fulfill specified scenario objectives. Winner claims glory and looser walks in shame to the rest of their life, or next game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rommel at Bay is an operational level simulation of the World War II Allied offensive in southern Tunisia which took place in mid-March 1943. Located here were the main Axis fortifications defending Tunisia, fortifications nearly as formidable as those at Alamein. Had the German-Italian army succeeded in defending, the war in North Africa would have been lengthened and perhaps Allied command would have changed again. The playing pieces represent the actual units which participated in the campaign and the map represents the actual terrain over which those units fought. Rommel at Bay is basically a two player game in which one player controls the Axis forces while his opponent controls the Allied forces.<br/><br/>The two players maneuver their units across the map and conduct combat according to the rules of play. Victory occurs and the game ends immediately when one player has achieved the conditions given in the scenario being played. The other player wins the game by preventing his opponent from achieving his victory conditions.<br/><br/>The game has two scenarios. The first (Medenine) is a smaller scenario of the battle that was fought March 6th to 8th 1943. The second scenario is the main Mareth Campaign March 20th to 28th.<br/><br/>",

Action cards, drawn at the beginning of a turn, provide ways to add, lose, trade and retrieve ingredient cards. The eight &quot;Instant Dishes&quot; among the action cards allow players to lock in a common ingredient and score 1 point.<br/>  <br/>Players can score a &quot;cuisine bonus&quot; for making multiple dishes from one of the five primary cuisines featured on dish cards (American, Continental, French, Italian and Mexican).

This game uses an updated, and slightly expanded, version of the MedWar Sicily game system: no CRT, just dice, and cards...a totally new approach to gaming battles that can be learned in five minutes and played in 2-3 hours.<br/><br/>Most of the rules and mechanics will be familiar to anyone who has ever played a wargame. Richard Berg however, has added to this simplicity a combat system that rates units for how many dice they get to roll on their behalf, as well as what kind of dice (small arms or Heavy Weapons).<br/><br/>The game also uses cards, one deck (of 10) for each player (whose cards are somewhat different from those of the other player) to enhance the game. (They don't &quot;drive&quot; the game and they can be left out, if you&rsquo;re so inclined.) The cards are part of a Resource system that gives the players a number of points which they can use to buy cards, rally units or bring in reinforcements. The choice is theirs, but there are far more choices than points.<br/><br/>The cards, themselves, give the players &quot;Opportunities&quot;, from using their (or negating their opponent&rsquo;s) tank capabilities, to getting more supplies, to special Breakthrough and Reaction movement.<br/><br/>Playing time for &ldquo;Desert War Egypt&rdquo; as averaged less than 3 hours, and the rules are only 8 pages, including rules for playing Solitaire.<br/><br/>Each game of Desert War Egypt includes full box, rules, one sheet of large 5/8&rdquo; die cut thick counters, dice, two decks of 10 cards, and a thick card stock game board.<br/><br/>According to the back of the box, the game will include new and updated counters for MedWar Sicily, the first game using this system.

Alternatively, the game can be timed and scored.<br/><br/>You start with a small number of provinces under your control.  Population counters of your colour indicate this; if a province has extra population, it can move some into an adjacent unoccupied province --this is the simplest way of conquest.  Merger, diplomacy and force (Risk-like combat) are your other options.  Each turn you draw a Yin card and a Yang card.  Yin is bad, Yang is good.  Without looking at either card's instructions, you assign them to two of your provinces.  Yang will most likely increase your recruitment (which is normally three population per turn), but could also give you the capability to cross a natural barrier like a mountain range.  Yin will hurt you.  Some cards you end up holding in your hand.<br/><br/>A player may attempt to convince another player to merge with his empire.  If the second player agrees then the smaller empire is absorbed by the larger and both players continue play as senior (larger) and junior (smaller) partners.  The absorbed empire no longer has a separate turn nor separate recruitment.  This concept of &quot;shared victory&quot; is intriguing, particularly with a larger number of players.<br/><br/>The game allows any number of players but components are only provided for five.<br/><br/>",

Each turn has three Phases: &quot;Economics &amp; Politics&quot; (where players spend resource points to perform raids, upgrade units, perform Electronic Warfare, and apply political pressure), &quot;Action and Reaction&quot; (where all naval, air and land movement and combat are carried out), and &quot;Administration&quot; (where random events take effect and victory is determined).<br/><br/>Points are gained for destroying enemy aircraft, sinking enemy ships, and for successful raids. The first player to attain 120 points is the winner.<br/><br/>Developer: Ty Bomba.<br/><br/>",

This game covers the earthy realms' full history: from the height of Dwarven power to its decline in the days of dragonfire and destruction.  Here, you will lead bands of Humans, Dwarves, Orcs and monsters on raids, wars and treasure hunts.<br/><br/>'The Lords of Undereath is a two player game of fantasy tactical combat in an underground labyrinth.  The rules cover solitaire play, surprise attack, pursuit, morale, locked doors, sentries, flight, treasure, mercenaries and even uncontrolled movement.  This game is a complete simulation of fantasy combat at the group (skirmish) level.<br/><br/>Lords of Underearth definitely pays off on its promises and then some.  It's easy to learn.  It plays fast.  The board is geomorphic which helps replayability.  Solitaire play actually works.  Four clever scenarios are presented, all of them are fun, like the one that sure reminds us of Smaug and the Lonely Mountain or another that is suspiciously similar to the battle at the Bridge at Khazad-d&ucirc;m. It's also compatible with Wizard &amp; Melee and The Fantasy Trip, although you'd never want to play it that way.<br/><br/>This game republished in supplement of Japanese TACTICS magazine #54.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The goal of Jumbo Grand Prix is to create strong race cars that score the most racing points.<br/><br/>Every player starts with 4 cards. In the next 4 rounds they try to build a competitive race car by changing their cards. A race car consists of a coach-work card, a tire card, an engine card, and a driver card. After 4 rounds, all the players show their race car for that race. The strength is the sum of the 4 played cards. The stronger the combination, the higher your finish place. In case of a tie, the value of the driver decides. Whenever you cannot make a complete car, you cannot take part in that race. When your coach-work, tires, and engine have the same value, the combination is worth 21 points, in spite of their original value. Then you add the value of the driver. When your driver is also of the same value, the total combination is worth 28 points.<br/><br/>When it's your turn, you can choose one of the following actions:<br/><br/>     1. Discard 1 of your cards (face up) and draw 2 new ones. The new cards can be drawn from the visible cards or from the closed pile. The 4 open piles are sorted by type. <br/>     2. Keep all your cards and draw 1 new card (from an open or the closed pile). <br/><br/><br/>So every turn you get 1 extra card. After 4 turns you have 8 cards, from which you must build your race car. The other 4 cards are used in the next round. Whenever you draw a card from one of the open piles, it is always the top one. From the type you just handed in, you cannot draw a new one from that type's open pile. At the start of each round, as many scoring cards are revealed as there are players. The winner gets the highest card and so on. Every player receives points, unless you cannot take part in the race. As soon as all scoring cards are used, the racing season is over. The player with the highest total of scoring cards wins the season (and the game).<br/><br/>",

Your emperor is nothing but a figurehead while the shogun holds the true power. There are many men who desire to hold the title of shogun and then there is you...<br/><br/>Bushido Breaker is a hidden movement card game of deduction &amp; calculated risks, themed as ninja vs. samurai, that is 2-4 players.<br/><br/>The game revolves around the ninja trying to move location-to-location, either disarming enough alarms before assassinating the shogun or by killing all the samurai, in order to win.<br/>The samurai are trying to kill the ninja or notice them enough in order to catch them.<br/><br/>The cards either represent different locations, ninja &amp; samurai actions, or samurai. Every card that the ninja has as an action, the samurai has a counter to. Through deduction, each team is trying to figure out what the other will play round-to-round. Though the samurai greatly out-number the ninja, their greatest challenge is figuring out where the ninja are and what they'll do next...<br/><br/>",

A piece can be removed only if it is at least long as the longest piece already removed by the same player.<br/><br/>Each player uses his/her own counter to keep track of his/her points but the counter itself is placed on the board (that is, the board is also the score track). The presence of a counter on the row/column from which a piece is taken doubles the points scored. A player can decide to score less points than he/she earned, therefore allowing to place the score counter in a more convenient place.<br/><br/>You can play Foundations and Hari with an Isaac set.<br/><br/>Source: Author's description<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.iggamecenter.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.iggamecenter.com/</a> - igGameCenter (real-time)<br/><br/><br/>Awards:<br/><br/>Winner of the NESTORGAMES continuous abstract game design contest<br/>Winner of the Abstract Game Design Contest at the Cald&egrave; &quot;Tutto &egrave; numero&quot; Mathematical Festival 2011<br/><br/>",

Flip and Write your way to the best combinations of fields, gardens, mills, farms and manors. But be careful! After each time you 'write', you hand your polder to the player on your left.<br/><br/>The game is set in the 17th century in the Netherlands, a time when the country was experiencing a massive economic boost and merchants were looking for ways to increase food production. As a result, they came up with massive projects to enclose lakes with dikes and pump out the water with windmills. The resulting low-lying tract of land is known as a polder. One polder was qualified as an UNESCO World Heritage site: the Beemster Polder. The Beemster has a solid dike of 42 kilometers long, was pumped dry with 43 windmills, has its lowest point at 7 meters (23 feet) below sea level, and has a surface of 72 square kilometers (nearly 28 square miles). The land created in this polder, and the three polders created in the following decades, was incredibly fertile and therefore mostly used for farms. But the rich and powerful of the nearby city of Amsterdam also created &lsquo;buitenplaatsen&rsquo; (country houses or manors). In the game Polders, the four big polders created in the first half of the 17th century are your playing field.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Further, it omits the neutral player pieces.<br/><br/>Players win by forming a continuous line of their own colour (by placing 3d tetris blocks) from one side of the board to the other.<br/><br/>     Players take turns playing a piece of their colour. The piece may be placed anywhere on the board, as long as it touches the game board, lines up with the grid, and creates no empty space underneath itself.<br/>     The game is won by the player connecting opposite sides of the board with a path made by pieces of their colour.<br/><br/><br/>",

To avoid catastrophic events, that energy was split into six parts called the Essences.<br/><br/>Sanctuaries are the only way to channel the power of the Essences. Players impersonate the Keepers, each one is attuned to an Essence and rules over a Faction. The Keepers are fighting each other to preserve their Sanctuaries and themselves.

        "description": "The object of the game is to be the first to drive your car off the side of the table. A road which has as many lanes as contestants is constructed from a number of gray road tiles. Each turn, players select a card from 2 to 10, which is the number of spaces they're moving. After these are revealed remembering that players cannot duplicate a card played by someone previous, players move forward down the road. Each of the cards allows for a certain number of road tile placements from your supply, a number of maneuvers per turn, and the damage your current speed will inflict should you careen into another car. Additionally, a percent of the tiles have special actions associated with them, which give the car on them the ability to jump, or hit a semi-truck, or skid out of control, or just plain slow down 'cuz there's a Smokey comin' on his flipside... The game is over when a car reaches the edge of the table, which gives the game a variable ending. Plus if ever a group of cars pulls out to a six-space lead, then all trailing cars are eliminated.<br/><br/>",

There are two sides for which you can play: the alliance of Peru and Bolivia or Chile .<br/><br/>The goal is to achieve 10 victory points or take one of the enemy capital cities, the first side to achieve one of these two goals is proclaimed the winner.<br/><br/>The game has several dynamics: first is war strategy with movement of troops and historic ships of the conflict, second is political-diplomatic strategy to gain advantages in combat or other fields, and the third is a heroic dimension with different historical characters to chose from who modify the game mechanics, like Grau, Prat, Avaroa, Bolognesi, Baquedano, Pinto, among others.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to contemplate this war from two centuries ago from a different perspective, with serenity and a playful-educational spirit. It's time to watch episodes of our history with the distance and reflection granted by time, without national animosities and at a table where friendship reigns.<br/><br/><br/>Guerra en el Pac&iacute;fico es un juego de mesa ambientado en el conflicto armado que entre 1879 y 1883 enfrent&oacute; a Per&uacute;, Bolivia y Chile, para 2, 3 o 4 jugadores de 8 a&ntilde;os de edad en adelante. Existen dos bandos por los que se puede jugar: la alianza de Per&uacute; y Bolivia o Chile.<br/><br/>El objetivo del juego es lograr 10 puntos de victoria o tomar una de las capitales enemigas, quien logre primero una de esas dos metas se procalama vencedor.<br/><br/>El juego tiene varias din&aacute;micas: la primera de estrategia b&eacute;lica con movimiento de tropas y de los barcos hist&oacute;ricos del conflicto, la segunda de estrategia pol&iacute;tico-diplom&aacute;tica para conseguir ventajas de combate o de otra clase, y la tercera una dimensi&oacute;n heroica, con diferentes personajes hist&oacute;ricos a escoger que modifican la mec&aacute;nica del juego, como Grau, Prat, Avaroa, Bolognesi, Baquedano, Pinto, entre otros.<br/><br/>El objetivo del juego es que contemplar la guerra de hace dos siglos desde un punto de vista distinto, con serenidad y esp&iacute;ritu l&uacute;dico-educativo.

The more houses he buys, the easier it'll be for him to hide from those pesky vampire hunters...which I suppose makes Count Dracula slightly less of a parasite than a landlord.<br/><br/>In the auction game Watch Out! That's a Dracula!, one player takes on the role of Dracula, who wants to win more houses than any other player and isn't picky about what those houses look like. They're opposed by the vampire hunters, who want to prevent Dracula from winning, while angling for the highest score themselves. Some houses are worth more than others, and, crucially, some features are worth bonus points for specific vampire hunters.<br/><br/>The tricky part? You know only your own identity. You don't know which of the other players is which vampire hunter and, even more distressingly, you're not sure which one of them is the villainous vampire. Your only clues are which houses they're eager to win &mdash; and if that's not difficult enough, you might even have to contend with a Frankenstein or a Woof Man!<br/><br/>Watch Out! That's a Dracula! is the 2022 Hollandays Sale freebie game &mdash; a whimsical and spoopy charmer that combines the sharp tension of auctions with the thrills of hidden-role deduction games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Every morning in Mumbai, over five thousand workers dressed in white swarm out to deliver more than 200,000 &quot;dabbas&quot; (multistoried lunch boxes) to the offices of the Indian metropolis. These &quot;Dabba Walla&quot; have been an iconic fixture in the cityscape since 1890. The food is freshly prepared at home by families, then collected from their front doors by the Dabba Walla. Even though some of the dabbas travel very far, they are delivered punctually via a network of intermediate stations with an amazing reliability of 99.999%! Now it's time to join the Dabba Walla on their daily journey through Mumbai...<br/><br/>The game Dabba Walla consists of two phases:<br/><br/>&bull; Pick-up phase: Take turns moving your Dabba Walla through Mumbai to collect dabba cards. Each time you pick up a card, you then play one of the three in your hand to take the depicted dabba tile &mdash; a polyomino of 1-4 squares &mdash; and place it in your cart, stacking tiles higher and higher as the rounds progress. Dabbas come in four colors, and you must place them on flat surfaces, filling holes with empty dabbas if needed. If you connect two half-chai symbols on tiles on the same level, you draw a random chai tile with a bonus action. Keep all played dabba cards in a personal discard pile.<br/><br/>&bull; Delivery phase: After everyone has placed fifteen tiles in their cart, it's time to deliver lunches! Pick up all the cards you played, then complete a number of delivery rounds equal to the highest level that someone has stacked their dabbas. Each round, each player plays and reveals one dabba card from their hand, optionally playing chai tiles as well. Sum the value of each color of dabba, then everyone scores their dabbas on the current level based on these values, removing the tiles from their carts. (Note: If not all players have dabbas on the current level being scored, they still play a card, but they score nothing.)<br/><br/>Once all the dabbas have been delivered, players score for their remaining chai tiles, then whoever has collected the most tips wins.<br/><br/>Dabba Walla contains two expansion modules to provide additional ways to score or change the value of dabbas being delivered.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Wikipedia:<br/><br/>Gonnect is a strategy board game for two players invented by Jo&atilde;o Pedro Neto in 2000.<br/><br/>The game is played with standard go equipment (though 13x13 boards are often preferred to 19x19) and all the rules of Go apply, except that players can't pass and the pie rule is used to determine who goes first.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to construct a group that connects any two opposite sides. A player can also win if his opponent has no legal moves (since suicides and passes are illegal).<br/><br/>Games between skilled players will end up temporarily deadlocked, since the square Go board allows a &quot;four corners&quot; configuration where neither side can strongly connect. However, since players can't pass, they eventually must start filling in the internal liberties of their groups. The player who has made the smallest amount of territory will presumably get killed first, so building more territory than your opponent is a secondary (but extremely common) means of forcing a connection and the win.<br/><br/>So, a gonnect game between similarly skilled opponents unfolds in two stages:<br/><br/><br/>     The board-filling stage where opponents race to connect sides until the position is deadlocked.<br/>     The eye-filling stage where opponents must fill in their own eye space or destroy their opponents. <br/><br/><br/>Although it shares many of the same tactics as go, some players feel that gonnect has a more interesting opening and endgame than Go. Most Go players, however, feel that the eye-filling stage of Gonnect is tedious, and that the game lacks the simple elegance of Go.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Subbuteo Cricket continued the line of sporting dexterity games started by Subbuteo football (soccer).  The game was played on a green beige mat, similar to that use for the soccer version.  The rules mimicked those of cricket (which will doubtless make this review impenetrable to most nationalities).<br/><br/>The bowling side placed the small red plastic ball in the channel in the bowling piece, which was then flicked to propel the ball towards the batsman and a small plastic wicket (complete with separate plastic bails).  The batting action was achieved by spinning a handle attached to a small plastic cricket bat, aiming to hit the ball to score runs; the number of runs scored depended on the distance the ball was hit.<br/><br/>The fielding side set out its players, which were small plastic men each on a molded plastic base which included a cup-shaped depression.  If the ball was hit into one of these depressions, that was a catch.<br/><br/>The rules allowed for run outs (flick the ball to hit the wickets), leg before wickets (a complex and controversial assessment of whether the ball hit the plastic batsman &quot;in line&quot; with the stumps) and even stumping.<br/><br/>The game did not have the genuine skill and excitement of the soccer version, but strangely it did just about work as a contest.<br/><br/>In line with other Subbuteo games, there was a variety of &quot;extras&quot; to buy, including scoreboards and boundary fences.  It was well worth saving your  pocket money in the 1970s to save for the Australian team (baggy green caps), or the West Indians (black players with maroon caps).<br/><br/>",

Each Infantry stand represents a fire teams of 3 to 6, centered around the primary weapon (such as an LMG or AT rocket) or the overall weapon type (such as automatic rifles or SMGs).<br/><br/>With a module system (aka 'Drop-ins'), the rules allow players to decide how simple or how sophisticated they want the game to be. Some of the modules are Infantry, Artillery, Air Power, and other special equipments or terrain rules.<br/><br/>The core rules contain only 'elementary' equipments for each of the periods. For example, only Germany, the USSR, and the US are represented in the WWII section. And only stats for 18 pieces of German equipment are covered, and the only tanks found (for the German) are Panther and Tiger. Players must be prepared to purchase additional data books or create their own stats.<br/><br/>",

Prove your worth to the Queen by capturing all the Demons before they escape!<br/><br/>The game is played in Turns which consist of two phases: Day time and Night time. Each Turn starts in the Day, where players may simultaneously perform a number of actions from the four available options. After all players have acted, Night begins. Every Night, Stone Demons come out of the Portal and move from tile to tile following the arrows. Players use Towers to snare Demons and the sunlight turns them back into stone. Stones are resources the players can spend during the next Day to upgrade Towers. After all Demons move, Day begins. Continue cycling through Day and Night until: players have captured all the Stone Demons from the Cave, any Demon walks off the map, or steps on the same Tile twice during the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Against the Odds magazine #23<br/><br/>Americans seldom notice the enormous changes that the Napoleonic Wars caused to the Western Hemisphere...things far larger and with much greater effects than our own War of 1812.<br/><br/>The Louisiana Purchase really started it, as Napoleon sold Jefferson a large block of land that really &quot;belonged&quot; to Spain. In shifting their forces to try and limit American expansion, the Spanish-loyal authorities opened the door to losing the remainder of two continents. Guerra a Muerte depicts the 14 year struggle that saw Spain's possessions in the hemisphere change from &quot;almost everything not U.S.&quot; to &quot;Cuba and Hispanola.&quot;<br/><br/>As in the American Revolution, the local population could be divided into &quot;patriots/revolutionaries&quot; on one side, &quot;loyalists/Royalists&quot; on the other, and a huge middle block of those who wished to stay out of battle--over which both sides exerted tremendous pressure, making these episodes as bitter as a period in history. The game title means, &quot;War to the Death,&quot; and comes from a proclamation Simon Bolivar made to all Spaniards in Venezuela--&quot;support us or else.&quot;<br/><br/>Warfare took place from the remote northern border with America to the tip of the continent now shared by Chile and Argentina. Progress ebbed and flowed, with territories changing hands several times and the intensity and size of battles slowly escalating.<br/><br/>The overall war is a fascinating struggle of varied elements, from Spanish and &quot;Royalist&quot; troops to formed patriot units, militias, armed mobs, Indians, and mercenaries. Actions include slave revolts, naval assaults, guerilla war, battles with a hostile environment, and the interplay of politics with economics...all depicted and intermeshed to affect overall play as they affected real events.

In each sum you must use at least 1 block which is already on table.<br/><br/>For each digit in a sum you get its value as victory points. So you try to use high numbers which are already placed. You can place high numbers from your own blocks too, but your opponents can profit when you place them easily available and combinable with other placed blocks. You should also try to hold good combinations of digits and operators for later turns.<br/><br/>While it requires calculating, it is more a puzzle game than a math game. You mainly search for possibilities by using deduction logic instead of calculating (which is induction logic).<br/><br/>",

It is a mystery solving game that combines three main elements:<br/>1) A modern mystery story written by professional crime author Arttu Tuominen. 2) Finding details from a &quot;Hidden image&quot; picture. 3) More or less classic puzzle solving. The puzzles range from single to four card ones, and from light to quite heavy.<br/>Players can use hints to help with the solving, but it costs them Reputation cards. Giving a wrong answer also makes the players lose a Reputation card.<br/>The more Reputation Cards the players have left at the end, the easier it is for them to follow the &quot;Hunch&quot; found on the remaining cards, and ultimately choosing the correct option in the &quot;Final Choice&quot;<br/>The high age recommendation comes from a few graphic details in the story. These can be skipped by parents playing with their children (12+), as long as they are aware such exist in the game.<br/><br/>Challenge Level 3/5<br/><br/>",

Of course the more equipment present, the more gangsters you'll need to get past everything. For a perfect robbery, you'll want to have blueprints of the bank, a safehouse to escape to (so that you don't have to wander the city eternally like the flying Dutchman), and gangsters who are perfect for the situation: an electrician for alarms, a safecracker for safes, and one &quot;gorilla&quot; for each guard. Oh, and unless you want to try walking away with the loot, you'll need some method of transportation.<br/><br/>Everything that players need is on the four types of cards: banks, hideouts, gangsters, and movement/action. In the first phase of the game, players draft their eleven-card hand &ndash; drawing a card from one stack and discarding a different type of card &ndash; until one player feels he has the perfect hand and shouts &quot;Bank robbery!&quot; This player is announcing that he has already robbed a bank, and now the other players need to figure out where the robbery took place and stop those thugs from getting to their hideout. (After all, if you're not getting the money, you don't want anyone else to have it either!)<br/><br/>This second phase ends when the gangsters reach their safehouse or one or more opponents block them and show a stronger hand of criminals. During this phase, the bank robber receives no new cards (since he's on the run) while the other players do, giving them resources to hunt down the crooks. If two or more opponents catch the crooks, they each get 10% of the money as a reward; if only one opponent catches the crooks, she can keep the 10% or she can grab the money herself and try to make it to her hideout.<br/><br/>After playing a predetermined number of bank robberies, the game ends and whoever holds the most money wins!<br/><br/>",

The game is for 3-5 players and lasts about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>The players take the roles of Industrialists - like William Henry Vanderbilt - who have hidden interests in railroads and try to maximize their profits. The players try to make the most money by auctioning shares of the different railroad companies and by paying out dividends at the right moment to get the most money out of the company. The player with the most money at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>Released as part of Winsome Games's 2013 Essen collection.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "More than three millennia have passed since the human race left its native land. The discovery of the Sophia triad made real some theories previously thought impossible, theories that were experimented to prove their viability and each of them were performed, no matter whether it was possible or not.<br/><br/>Dark Matter is a game from 2 to 4 players. Each player starts with three unique cards to play all the game. Each card is divided in two zones in its obverse and reverse, and each zone has one or several skills. Players play these skills to get matters to terraform planets, to recruit soldiers, to attack enemy planets, to improve their own planets, to use heroes and politics to manipulate their cards and opponents cards, to get resources, and more.<br/><br/>But players won't play only with their own cards. They can also use the opponent cards. Each time a card is played it changes its position, so possibilities are infinite. When a player uses his cards, he spins his card (from front to back) and when he uses the opponent cards, they flip the card (from up to down). In this way, new matters and skills are available to play more actions.<br/><br/>Get victory points controlling planets and use them to get more resource gems, soldiers or skills. Recruit a huge army gives also victory points and it helps to get enemy resource from their planets. All this with only three cards in hand. Impossible? Try it out!<br/><br/><br/>Han pasado m&aacute;s de tres milenios desde que la humanidad abandonase su Tierra natal.  El descubrimiento de la Tr&iacute;ada Sophia ha logrado que teor&iacute;as cient&iacute;ficas imposibles de demostrar no s&oacute;lo se pudieran experimentar para vislumbrar su veracidad, sino que cada una de ellas se pudieran llevar a cabo.  Tanto si eran posibles, como si no.<br/><br/>Dark Matter es un juego para 2 a 4 jugadores.  Cada jugador recibe al principio de la partida 3 &uacute;nicas cartas que ser&aacute;n con las que juegue toda la partida. Cada carta est&aacute; dividida en dos partes tanto por su anverso como por su reverso.  Cada una de esas partes tiene una o varias habilidades que los jugadores podr&aacute;n activar para generar materias con las que terraformar planetas, reclutar soldados para atacar los planetas enemigos, mejorar sus propios planetas, utilizar h&eacute;roes y pol&iacute;ticos para manipular sus cartas y las de los contrarios, generar recursos, etc.<br/><br/>En su turno, cada jugador puede utilizar la habilidad de la parte superior de sus cartas que &eacute;l vea y las partes superiores de las cartas de los dem&aacute;s jugadores que vea (los anversos).  Cuando un jugador utiliza una de sus cartas, le da la vuelta en la mano, quedando la habilidad que ha utilizado a la vista de los dem&aacute;s jugadores, que podr&aacute;n usarla en sus turnos.  A la vez, si un jugador utiliza una de las cartas de sus oponentes, girar&aacute; la carta en la mano de su oponente quedando la parte superior en la inferior.<br/><br/>Adicionalmente cada jugador puede usar las habilidades que le otorgan sus planetas terraformados y las habilidades de los dem&aacute;s planetas controlados por los oponentes, enviando a sus soldados.  Al final de la cuarta ronda de juego, el jugador con m&aacute;s puntos de victoria ser&aacute; el ganador y due&ntilde;o de la galaxia.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, draw a card from the deck or the discard pile, then exchange it with a card in your grid, discarding that card face up; alternatively, you can discard the drawn card to reveal a face-down card in your grid. With the right card in hand, you can even steal a card from another player's grid.<br/><br/>As soon as you have three cards of the same color or number in a row, whether vertically, horizontally or diagonally, you discard those cards, then replace them with face-down cards from your personal stack. If any one player has discarded all 15 of their cards or has all cards in their grid face up, the game end is triggered. Every player takes one more turn and then players tally their remaining cards.

        "description": "Fossil Canyon is a competitive, lightly-strategic set-collection card game developed in collaboration with the Field Museum of Chicago.  You are a fossil-hunting paleontologist with the goal of constructing complete dinosaur skeletons that attract visitors to your museum.  Each dinosaur skeleton has a different point value (represented as visitors per year) and may consist of two, three, or four unique fossils.<br/><br/>On each turn, you dig fossils from the dig site (scattered face-down fossil cards), initiate trades with other players, take a bonus dig if you manage to complete a skeleton for your museum, and rearrange your fossil cards so that all but three are visible to other players.  Strategic choices include deciding which fossils to expose and the number of increasingly expensive trades you perform to try to complete a skeleton or win a research award.  Random events, such as erosion, may force you to alter your strategy.<br/><br/>Fossil Canyon uses a unique jigsaw-puzzle scoring method, where each skeleton or research award is represented by a puzzle piece with a length proportional to its value.  No adding victory points or moving pawns on a board; the length of your puzzle-museum indicates your standing in the game.<br/><br/>Fossil Canyon is a family-oriented STEM game.  Adults will appreciate the beautifully-illustrated cards and the unique set-collection mechanics that make Fossil Canyon a fast-playing, lightly-strategic game.  Children will love the dinosaur theme and the tactile jigsaw puzzle scoring, turning the game into a race.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Keep in mind that horses of this period were too small to &quot;ride&quot; with a man on their back in a &quot;cavalry&quot; way. Only chariots offered a battle platform faster than sandals, and provided the &quot;shock troops&quot; of their day and a platform to designate the aristocracy and elite peoples. Alexander and the Roman legions might sneeze at chariot power... but not for another 900 years!<br/><br/>Kadesh must be the chariot battle of all time. Sources conflict and disagree, but there may have been as many as 5000 chariots in this twisted, confused, and bloody battle, fought to determine the borders between Egypt and the Hittite confederacy...<br/><br/>As an early example of &quot;spin,&quot; Egyptian pharaoh Ramses II claimed a tremendous victory and the total vanquishing of the Hittite army... although he also signed a peace treaty that left the disputed city of Kadesh in the hands of the Hittites and never returned. Hmm. (A later and more formal treaty between Ramses and the next Hittite king is reproduced on the walls of the United Nations, as one of the first recorded international peace treaties. Ramses did not get Kadesh with that one either.)<br/><br/>Now you can take the reins and lead your lines/lions into battle. Day of the Chariot: Kadesh offers a classic design by Gene Dickens fully updated into a tactical view of one of the most-discussed battles of middle eastern history, with 320 double-sided counters, 30 minute turns, and everything you need to play a system emphasizing command control and flexibility (or the lack thereof). Three distinct scenarios provide the battle that did happen (according to Ramses), the battle that both sides had &quot;prearranged&quot; to happen, and the smaller, more confused battle that historians think actually did happen. (You may be surprised how different the &quot;same&quot; battle can be!)<br/><br/>",

Each turn, players have access to resources; the basic ones can be taken easily from a draw pool, but you may also trade them away for advanced ones. At any time on your turn, you can also construct one building. To do so, you must play a certain number and combination of resources, then take (construct) the corresponding building.<br/><br/>Construction is a bit tricky, however, as at any given time only three buildings are available for players to construct and any player may construct any building. Thus, you may be collecting resources for one building, but another player manages to construct it first, forcing you to readjust your plans. The first player to construct a certain number of buildings (depending on the number of players) wins.<br/><br/>",

As the medical supplies are limited, you may find your competitive peers grabbing the last batch of bandages or antibiotics before you.<br/><br/>After setting up the hospital wards, a rush of patients arrive in the form of cards. Also, five dice are rolled and added to the common supply cabinet.  Each die matches a medical supply type needed to heal the various patients.  Players take turns selecting groups of dice from the supply cabinet, equal to six units (pips) of supplies and use them to heal or train for prestige points.<br/><br/>Field Hospital plays like a simplified version of Macao.

One rich in technology, settlements &amp; farms, markets &amp; exotics, as well as, temples &amp; sacred sites.<br/><br/>Specifically, the players claim domains by building camps, upgrading those camps to villages, and ultimately into great cities. The various settlement types project varying degrees of influence over the domains. By controlling the domains,the players will earn a number of different victory point multipliers (including farms, markets, temples, and sacred sites). In addition the players will use their settlements to control three kinds of resource dice (forest, mountain, and desert dice). Each respective dice type offers a unique set of odds for resource procurement (forest dice offer much wood, some clay, and an occasional exotic good; mountain dice offer much stone, some metal, and an occasional exotic good; finally desert dice offer equal odds of wood, stone, clay, and metal, with a greater chance for exotic goods.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, the players will strive to attain victory points on 4 tracks:<br/><br/>Subsistence (farms x settlement score [village = 1, city = 3]).<br/>Commerce (markets x exotics)<br/>Theology (temples x sacred sites)<br/>Technology (single score, no multiplier)<br/><br/>Over the course of six rounds of scoring (six generations), the players will compete for the highest final score.<br/><br/>",

Operations points are expended to recruit the special ops team, then to move and attack on the map. A deck of event cards controls the opposition forces (OPFOR). Combat is resolved using a quasi-tactical system with opposing units taking turns firing at one another.

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/><br/> Girl Genius: The Works is a non-collectible card game that consists of several standalone decks of cards. You can play the game with any one of those decks, while also being able to combine some or all of those decks into a single deck for a longer game or a game with more players. Each deck contains many unique cards, but the gameplay is the same in all cases.<br/><br/>Each player gets a five-card hand and twelve cards are laid out face-down in a patchwork pattern. Each card has colored symbols along each side, as well as a point value and special instructions. On your turn, you reveal one face-down card, then spin any face-up card 180&ordm;. After spinning, if any of the symbols on the edges of the spun card match the symbols on one or more of the surrounding cards, you &quot;pop&quot; the card(s) with the most matching symbols. &quot;Popping&quot; a card means that you must follow the instructions on the card (whether helpful or harmful), then (usually) add it to your score pile. Cards in your hand are used to replace any popped cards. The game is played until one player has 70/50/40/30 points with two/three/four/more than four players.<br/><br/>The four standalone decks as of September 2018 are:<br/><br/><br/>    Castle Wulfenbach<br/>    Master Payne's Circus of Adventure<br/>    Castle Heterodyne<br/>    The Siege of Mechanicsburg<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Killing Code: Venice Vendetta is a cooperative reasoning game in which the players must work together to discover the identity of a killer in the city before it is too late. One player acts as the killer, secretly assuming the identity of one of the citizens of Venice and looking for opportunities to kill some of the others. The other players act together to unmask the killer's identity. Within the round limit, the killer must keep their identity hidden and complete their killings, while the other players must investigate the murder methods to discover clues leading to the killer's unmasking and stop these atrocities.<br/><br/>Aside from the standard game mode, the game includes five scenarios that can provide players with more rules and story experiences.<br/><br/>Game Playing:<br/><br/>Stage 1: Flip Over Cards:<br/><br/>At the start of this stage, the killer takes all the character cards still in play, shuffles them face down and places the pile in front of him.（In the first round of a normal game, this will be all 13 character cards, reduced each round when the killer takes victims).<br/>Deal a number of character cards according to the number of players, then flip those cards face-up and place them in area easily reached by all players.  These will be the character cards availible for use this round.<br/><br/>Stage 2: The Investigators Act<br/>Starting with the investigator to the left of the killer, that player chooses one of the availible character cards for this round and places it face-up in front of him or herself.  Once a character card has been placed in front of a player no other investigator may choose that card.  After placing the card infront of him or herself, the investigator can move that character according to the movement value on the card and one active ability on the card.  After the investigator finishes moving his or her chosen character and taking any actions, the next investigator clockwise repeats this process until all investigators have taken a character card.<br/><br/>Stage 3: The Killer Acts<br/>The killer's stage consists of 2 parts: movement and murder.<br/>-Movement-<br/>The killer can choose from 2 options for movement：<br/><br/>     Use the remaining 2 character cards unchosen by the non-killer players.  The killer chooses what order to use these cards in.<br/>     Use 1 card in front of a non-killer player.<br/><br/><br/>After the killer has taken his or her movement action(s), he or she is ready to take a life.<br/>-Murder-<br/>The killer selects a killing code card from his or her hand, using its ability to end the lives of one or more characters based on the qualifications of the killing code card text.  Each round the killer can only make use of 1 killing code card.  Please refer to the killing code card section of this rulebook for further clarification.  The killer dons the mask, dramatically announces who will die, then lays that character's marker down in the block they were just alive in.  Search the character cards for the character killed and place that card face up on the grave marker from this round, then the killer places the killing code card that he or she used face down on top of that character card.  If multiple characters were killed at once, place them all on the same grave before placing the killing code card over them.<br/><br/>Accusation Round<br/>After the killer has successfully killed 5 or more characters or has used 5 killing code cards, the game immediately enters a special final round called the accusation round.<br/>The final round is an additional round which only has the first 2 stages, the killer will not take any action in this round, instead he or she should don the mask, steeple his or her hands and watch the proceedings dramatically. When the investigators are finished moving in this round, they must immediately make an accusation.  The investigators may only accuse one suspect.  Various methods of reaching an agreement on this accusation include：<br/><br/>     Discussion<br/>     Voting<br/>     Arm Wrestling<br/>     Drinking Contest<br/>     Giving in to the Most Persuasive Who-Donnit Speech<br/>     Being Generally Louder than the Other Investigators<br/>     Agree with the Person you Secretly Find Attractive<br/>     Bribing, Coercing, or Torturing the Killer<br/><br/><br/>Or any additional methods which the design company assumes no responsibility for the consequences of.<br/>Or whatever, you know, it doesn't matter, just guess.<br/><br/>Faced with this accusation, the killer must flip up his or her suspect card with a flourish.<br/><br/>Victory or Defeat<br/>Complete the Accusation<br/>So close, yet so far very very wrong...<br/>No matter when it is made, if the accusation was correct, the investigators win.<br/>If the accusation was wrong, the killer wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You are members of an old English aristocratic family. Your uncle from America had the excellent idea of ​​passing away bequeathing you his immense fortune. To celebrate the event, you decide to go for tea and enjoy some scones. However, each being equally greedy, each of the heirs decides to poison the cookies with Arsenic (a safe bet) in order to increase their share of their inheritance. Digestion promises to be difficult...<br/><br/>Tea, Scones and ARSENIC is a family game, for 1 to 6 players. It&rsquo;s a bluff party-game full of thought, strategy and a hint of luck.  Goal of the game : Eat the most Scones without dying in excruciating pain.<br/><br/>Setting up : Each player chooses a Cup board for their aristocrat (the choice of characters has no effect on the course of the game), and take 3 Sugar Cubes. The Scones are placed randomly, Poison side down, in the cookie box. You play with all the Scones, regardless of the number of players. Some Scones are normal, but others contain varying amounts of poison. The amount of poison is indicated at the back of the Scone. For each type of Scone, there are 2 harmless and 4 poisoned.  The lethal dose at which a character succumbs to poison and is eliminated from the game differs depending on the number of players.<br/><br/>The 1st player takes a Scone in hand and turns it over discreetly to know his dose of poison (the other players should not see anything), he can shuffle the Scones before picking if he want to.<br/>Either he eats it (he decides to keep it and places it in his Cup in front of him, Poison side hidden) or he puts it back in its place in the box and consumes a Sugar Cube to delay (he can shuffle the Scones afterward if he want to). In the course of the game, Scones pile up on his Cup. A player can look at his Scones at any time. In either case, their turn ends and it is the next player&rsquo;s turn. When a player runs out of Sugar Cube, he is forced to eat the Scone.<br/><br/>Each player, at the start of their turn (before playing), can decide that they have had enough, and stop playing (they take a turn each time it is their turn to play). In doing so, he forces the other players to continue for 2 more rounds (Honor rounds) without the possibility for them to stop. Once the 2 Honor Rounds have been completed, one of the surviving players (if any) may in round choose to stop. The remaining players therefore set off for 2 additional Honor Rounds. And so on&hellip;<br/><br/>If a player reaches his natural resistance to poison (i.e. the number of arsenic doses he accumulated equals or exceeds the lethal dose), he dies (he is eliminated and his Scones are not counted). The deceased may choose to simply turn their board over to the Deceased side and laconically announce &laquo; I&rsquo;m dead &raquo;. Or ... he may suddenly put his hands to his throat, uttering terrible rumblings interspersed with barely audible words such as &laquo; Cursed! &raquo;, &laquo; Why so much hatred ... &raquo; or &laquo; Who will feed the dog? &raquo; Before slipping slowly from his chair and ending up lying on the floor in a grotesque position.

        "description": "In Ubongo, players compete to solve individual puzzles as quickly as they can. Ubongo! Fun-Size Edition keeps this same idea, but challenges players to complete puzzles in a new way.<br/><br/>In the game, each player has a set of eight polyomino pieces, each a different color. Players decide before the game begins whether they'll use the A- or B-side of the puzzle cards, with the A-side puzzles requiring exactly three pieces to complete and the B-side puzzles requiring exactly four. Which pieces? Well, you have to figure that out for yourself, with each puzzle having at least three different solutions.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, each player receives a new puzzle card and must race to fill in the blank spaces as quickly as possible. As soon as one player has done this, they start counting down to zero and everyone else must complete their puzzle before time is up. Whoever completes their puzzle card in time keeps the card for a point; the player who started the countdown both keeps their card and earns a gemstone worth one point. After eight rounds, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>To even the playing field between adults and children in Ubongo! Fun-Size Edition, the adults can play without the yellow piece &mdash; a straight line that covers three spaces. All of the puzzles can be solved without this piece, but doing so will be more difficult than normal...<br/><br/>",

In between rounds players have the option of swapping cards from- and into their playing deck, which changes the capabilities of each player for the next round.<br/><br/>You win a game by either destroying three zones on the enemy ship to sink them, or get rid of the entire enemy crew as to set them adrift into the rocks.<br/><br/>You will have to position your crewmen and cannons tactically to do as much damage to the enemy boat as possible, all the while trying to avoid your opponent from doing the same to you. Aside from that, you have your captain to think about. Losing them is a costly mistake and will give opponent the upperhand. A game focused on patience, tactics and outwitting your opponent.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A small card game featuring a supermarket theme and a Can't Stop-like element to gameplay. Each turn, players may either draw a card or score their hand and begin collecting groceries anew. Hands are scored by multiplying the values of one type of grocery (milk, canned corn, etc. - the player decides which type will score) by the total number of cards in a players hand. The risk: If a player draws one of the 6 Fiasko cards, all cards in his hand are forfeit (apparently the grocery display had grown too tall and toppled over, based on the graphics). The deck also contains two Catastrophe cards, which cause all but the player who draws them to discard their hands. Players may score each type of grocery only once per game. The game ends when one player has scored all five types of merchandise. Player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

There are four full-color 22x34&quot; maps and lots of counters.<br/><br/>A new addition is the command system. This forces players to activate one corps at a time, and move all units of that corps before you move any other. The movement rate is decided by a die-roll. All units within range of their commander may use a single die-roll, while out-of-command units must roll separately.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn is a Dark Fantasy strategic and tactical wargame. Play as one of four Princes, each with unique strengths and weaknesses. Accumulate resources by exploration, building mines and temples, and fighting for key positions. In addition to resource and strategic management, you also manage the details of your units&rsquo; Formations, Fatigue, Damage Levels, Rank, Ammunition, etc. The combat dynamics revolve around a richly detailed and heavily researched simulation of the four primary weapon systems of ancient warfare: Light Infantry, Heavy Infantry, Light Cavalry and Heavy Cavalry. Learning how to use each unit to maximum effectiveness is paramount to achieving victory. Additionally, unique fantasy units, including flying units, as well as a variety of spells from Enchantments, Curses, and Area of Effect are included. The game comes with highly detailed Record Sheets customized to each Prince&rsquo;s units in order to track the various in-game details.<br/><br/>Though random events add flavor to the game, luck has been minimized to emphasize strategy and tactics. Battles do not hinge on the outcome of a die roll, but rather reward planning and superior positioning. A modular game board provides new terrain configurations every time you play, and terrain plays a key element in how you develop your strategy and tactics as terrain effects are customized for each unit. Each Prince has their own unique and highly detailed handbook describing each of their unit types in great detail, and each unit is further broken down into easy-to-reference sections within the handbooks. Unlike many games where you wait for another player to complete their turn before taking your own, this game is designed to keep everyone equally involved during all aspects of play, including the Movement and Attack phases. Though not recommended for the casual gamer, Prince of Chaos: Battle for Tae Orn provides a robust challenge for anyone who desires to plumb the depths and details of ancient fantasy warfare.<br/><br/>",

Put your carefully arranged bouquets in pretty vases, place them on your shelves, and add cute little knick-knacks as a final touch. Make your shop the envy of all other florists with the most inviting display!<br/><br/>The Little Flower Shop Dice Game, a dice-based take on The Little Flower Shop, is played over six days (rounds). In each round, players simultaneously roll five dice &mdash; 3 flower dice, 1 vase die, and 1 initiative die &mdash; then take turns based on the initiative die's result. On a turn, you must lock 1-2 dice, or pay money to lock more or none. Unlocked dice must be rerolled on the next turn. When you lock all your dice, you can take an &quot;arrangement tile&quot; that matches your dice roll and place it on a shelf (player board) in your shop. In addition to scoring points for the flowers themselves, you want to accomplish a task set out at the beginning of the game. (Six tasks are included, with only one used each game.)<br/><br/>The player with the best display after six days wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Once all dwarves have been recruited each player will be able to buy tools that they will be allowed to attribute to each of their dwarves. Those tools will offer them some abilities to help to gather more gold, mine more safely or to have more chance to escape this dangerous mine alive.<br/><br/>Once equipped it is time to send them down the mine. Every player will place their dwarves in the mine, the deeper they go the more gold is to be found but the risks are greater.<br/><br/>Then comes the time to search for gold, every dwarf will draw cards depending of where they are in the mine and collect gold nuggets depending of those cards. They will try to avoid the mine collapsing on them and then to leave the tunnel with the gold without getting stuck inside.<br/><br/>After three rounds repeating those phases the winner will be the player that collected the most gold nuggets. Between each turn player will be able to keep the tools to have more choices to equip their dwarves the following turn and an event will happens at the beginning of each one to spice the game up, slightly changing the rules and the strategies.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(From the Publisher)<br/>The Battlelines&trade; series of card games allow players to recreate the epic struggles of World War II. Each player uses a deck of cards to represent the troops of an historical formation about the size of a division. A third deck, the Operation deck, is used to create a series of battles using Mission and Location cards. Points are scored for achieving Mission objectives and destroying enemy troops. A typical 100 point Operation can be played in about an hour.  The game can also be played by teams of up to three players on each side.<br/><br/>This, the first  in the Battlelines&trade; Series World War II card games. It includes Units and Operations from the German 1942 offensive against Stalingrad, the Soviet counter-attack (Operation Uranus) which trapped the German 6th Army in the city, and the gallant efforts of 4th Panzer Army to relieve their surrounded comrades (Operation Winter Storm).<br/><br/>Unit Decks represent divisional level assets. They are the basic play decks. One is needed for each player. Operation Decks are used to generate a &quot;random&quot; series of &quot;scenarios&quot; depicting several days of fighting. Higher Echelon Decks will allow players to introduce new cards into their Unit Decks to liven up the game and surprise their opponents with new stratagems.<br/><br/>The decks are not &quot;collectible&quot; per se.  There are no &quot;rare&quot; cards to collect.  They can however be customized by mixing in units from &quot;higher echelon&quot; decks that are available.  The game is considered &quot;expandable&quot; since there are many different decks (sold individually) that can be played against each other.<br/><br/>",

Draft Cryptids<br/>Deal each player 8 Cryptid cards facedown. Each player looks at their hand, chooses 1 card, and places it in a facedown stack in front of themselves.<br/><br/>Each player then passes their remaining 7 cards to the player on their left. Each player again chooses 1 card and adds it to their facedown stack, then passes their remaining hand to the left. Players continue picking and passing until each player has a stack of 8 cards in front of themselves. (Note that each player must add the last card that is passed to them to their stack.)<br/><br/>3.

Reveal Card: Choose 1 card from your hand and place it faceup in front of yourself.<br/>3.2. Activate Abilities : You may use abilities on your faceup<br/>Cryptid cards. To use each ability, you must activate the card (turn it sideways) along with the required number of cards of the same type (see &ldquo;Activating Cryptid Cards,&rdquo; next page).<br/>3.3. Complete Assignments: If your faceup cards meet the requirements to complete a Public Assignment, claim the card from the center of the play area, place it in front of yourself, and turn it sideways to show it&rsquo;s completed. If you complete your Private Assignment, simply turn it sideways to show it&rsquo;s completed.<br/><br/>4. End of Round<br/>The round ends once no one has any cards left in their hand.<br/>Gather all Cryptid cards in front of all players (both activated and unactivated) and place them in a discard pile next to the deck. (If a player completed an Assignment that lets them keep a card, they may keep it instead of discarding it.)<br/><br/>Each player keeps their completed Assignments, as well as their Private Assignment if it wasn&rsquo;t completed. All uncompleted Public Assignments are left in the center of the table for players to complete the following round.<br/><br/>Pass the Bus to the player with the fewest points from completed Assignments (not counting hidden Reward tokens), or the fewest Reward tokens in the case of a tie.<br/>Begin the next round by dealing each player 2 new Assignments from the deck.<br/><br/>END OF THE GAME<br/>The game ends after 3 rounds.<br/>Players reveal their Reward tokens and total up the points on their Rewards and completed Assignments.

The suit on the water space on which the leading boat is placed is always trumps.<br/>     A round is finished once all cards have been played and 8 tricks have been taken.<br/>     After the player who took the last trick has moved their boat forward, they remove any free water card from the sea route.

        "description": "Attack the walls, build siege weapons, explore the dungeons, and prepare your strategy on the fast-paced card game Castlecards. Destroy the enemy castles to win the game!<br/><br/>Each player starts with a castle card, protected by three wall cards. A castle can't be attacked until you destroy its walls (unless you get an assault card). The defense value of the castle and walls is represented by shields; to destroy a card, you need to attack with more swords than shields. You can attack with several cards, gathering soldiers, bowmen, siege weapons, etc. Your enemy can avoid your attack using academy cards (strategies to reduce the damage taken).<br/><br/>There are different decks on the game:<br/><br/><br/>     The Town deck provides soldiers, bowmen, builders, explorers, gold and more. You will draw 1 Town card on each turn, and you will perform an action then (an action can be played with 1 or more cards at the same time).<br/>     The Siege deck provides siege weapons with high attack power; you can get Siege cards using your builders and gold.<br/>     The Academy deck provides tactics to avoid enemy attacks.<br/>     The Dungeon deck will be open with explorers; beat a deck to get a treasure (additional town cards).<br/><br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>Castlecards: Asalto al Castillo es un juego de cartas de partidas r&aacute;pidas donde la estrategia y la suerte se entremezclan para disputar batallas medievales. Podr&aacute;s construir armas, explorar mazmorras, preparar tu defensa, atacar murallas y asaltar los castillos enemigos.<br/><br/>Es un juego muy f&aacute;cil de aprender a jugar, de 2 a 4 jugadores en partidas de unos 10/15 minutos, a partir de 9 a&ntilde;os.<br/><br/>Tu objetivo es asaltar los castillos rivales para preservar tu poblado, pero para conseguirlo tendr&aacute;s que acabar antes con las murallas que los protegen.<br/><br/>Cada partida empieza con 1 castillo y 3 cartas de muralla para cada jugador. Se reparten 5 cartas de Poblado a cada uno y en cada turno podr&aacute;s robar una carta de Poblado y realizar una acci&oacute;n.<br/><br/>Con estas cartas podr&aacute;s realizar ataques, defenderte, construir armas, explorar mazmorras y otras acciones.<br/><br/>Las cartas de tu fortaleza, murallas y castillo, tienen un valor de defensa representado por una cantidad de escudos. Las cartas de ataque, como soldados, arqueros y armas, tienen un valor de ataque representado por espadas. Para atacar una carta puedes unir tantas unidades como desees y lanzar un ataque: si el n&uacute;mero de espadas supera al de escudos, tu ataque vencer&aacute;.<br/><br/>Las unidades de ataque tambi&eacute;n tienen valores de defensa, y pueden apostarse en las murallas o el castillo para defenderlo. Adem&aacute;s, podr&aacute;s usar cartas de reacci&oacute;n para intentar repeler un ataque.<br/><br/>&iexcl;Utiliza tus cartas con habilidad para asaltar el castillo enemigo!<br/><br/>",

The map extends from Korea and Manchuria in the north to Indonesia in the south, to the Ganges River delta and Mongolia on the west. Each game turn represents three months. Units of maneuver are corps, armies, divisions and brigades, and they&rsquo;re presented in the form of 176 large-size, NATO-style counters, with the following types represented: infantry, light infantry, garrison, armor, mechanized, marines, airborne, special operations, cavalry, fortress, headquarters, tactical airbases, strategic airbases, supply, naval bombardment task forces, carrier task forces, and amphibious task forces.<br/>  <br/>The concept of &ldquo;victory points&rdquo; (VP) is central to play of the game. Players begin each scenario with a designated number of them. They expend them to gain reinforcements and carry out actions. They gain new VP as a result of achieving objectives; they lose VP when they lose units in combat. To win the game you must have more VP than your opponent; so play becomes a balancing act between expending VP and attaining objectives.<br/><br/>There are 12,446 words in the game&rsquo;s basic rules, and another 10,886 in the optionals (which will only be presented in the on-line eRules). That means two experienced players can complete the shortest of the game&rsquo;s three scenarios in about six hours. The game has been designed with two-player play primarily in mind, but solitaire play is doable.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Santa has his hands full and Christmas is just around the corner. What is worse, all his Elven helpers aren&rsquo;t well. In such circumstances Santa asked for help from his closest friends - the Vikings. You are the leader of one of the mighty Viking Horde which came to the shores of The Grateful Island. Your goal is to visit the local town homes and &ndash; obviously - deliver presents. Then you can in turn collect the tokens of gratitude left there for Santa!<br/><br/>Giftbringer is a roll&amp;write game. To play you&rsquo;ll need 4 six-sided dice, the Rulebook and for each placer a pen/pencil and a Player Sheet. Before the start of the game randomly determine the Merry Leader (rolling player).<br/><br/>The game itself consists of 10 Rounds. At the beginning of each Round the Merry Leader rolls the 4 six-sided dice. All players write down the roll results in the slots for the given Round on their Player Sheets. The results of the roll are the numbers that the players can use that Round. For each die roll the player can cross off a die symbol on one of the Vikings, one of the Roads or one of the Houses. Alternatively he can use one or two of those die rolls for a Special Action (Santa's Blessing), but each Special Action can only be used once per game.<br/><br/>Initially each player has to Recruit a Viking - without one he cannot Visit the town itself. This also applies if a Viking already delivered all his Presents and the player has to Recruit another one. After having the first available Viking the player has to choose one of the Ships on the map to start his journey (this cannot be changed later, even with a new Viking). From that ship he can then start crossing the die symbols on Roads and Houses to visit them. He cannot jump over Houses or Roads and can only progress to an unvisited Road/House, adjacent to any of his already visited Roads/Houses.<br/><br/>When a player crosses the die symbol on a Road segment leading to a House (including crossing a potential die symbol on the House itself), he visits the House. Then he has to cross the required number of Presents on his Viking (and the House) in order to get the token of gratitude available there (which he writes down under his Viking). Once all gratitude token spaces of a Viking are filled, that Viking has done his job and cannot be used anymore - the player has to Recruit another one. If a Happiness symbol is also present on the House, after delivering the Presents for that House the player marks the next available Happiness token on his track.<br/><br/>After completing the last Round the player with the most points will be the winner of the game. Points are scored for each collected token of gratitude and for the achieved level of Happiness on a given player's Happiness track. Additionally, the final score can be influenced by the number of a given type of collected tokens of gratitude (e.g. 15 points for collecting 8 Cookies).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Kingdoms of Crusaders, players assemble units to create armies and overwhelm opponents competing for the same territories. The game includes components for a two-player game; by combining two sets, up to four players can compete.<br/><br/>Units are represented by cards, with each card depicting the forces in it with color-coded symbols across its top. The forces come in five strengths, which from weakest to strongest are Lance, Bow, Sword, Helmet and Banner. For example, a unit (card) with Sword and Helmet will have across the top: blank, blank, green, yellow, blank. Each player starts with a hand of five cards and a location card on the table depicting five territories, which is where a player lays his cards.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws a card from the deck, then lays one card from his hand into one of the territories next to his location card. Each territory can have no more than four cards in it. Once you've played four cards into a territory, you've determined the final strength of the army there. If the same symbol is on all four cards, you've created a Regiment; the same symbol on only three cards creates a Battalion, and the same symbol on only two cards creates a Company. (You can create multiple Regiments, Battalions and Companies in the same territory.)<br/><br/>To determine who wins the battle in a territory, compare each player's army in this territory. The player whose army has the most Regiments wins; if players are tied for the number of Regiments, then the player with the strongest Regiments wins; if players have equally strong Regiments, then the player with the most Battalions wins; and so on. Even if his opponent(s) have not completed their armies, a player can win a territory by proving that it's impossible for someone to create a stronger army in the same territory.<br/><br/>When a player wins a territory, he places a lowest available victory marker on this army. Once all five victory markers have been claimed, the game ends. The player who collects the most markers wins; if players are tied for the number of victory markers, then the player whose markers have the lowest sum wins.<br/><br/>",

Once a planet has reached its full capacity, you also activate its special ability and upgrade your hand size.<br/><br/>You use coins to buy new cards from a central market line-up, which displays factories, orbital stations, carrier ships and workers, which score the most VP.  You use carrier ships to draw new cards depending on the amount of factories of the same resource you built on your board, and orbital stations grant you new permanent powers without taking up any space on your board.<br/><br/>Colonize your planets and get a good combination of structures to get more resources during the harvesting phase and, in the end, dominate Trappist One!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sayū is an abstract strategy tile-laying, tile-flipping for two players. It is played with 49 unique two-sided octagonal wooden tiles and uses no board. The objective of the game is to have more tile of your color face up when all the tiles are placed.<br/><br/>To setup the game place the home tile at the center of the table. This tile has no arrows. From now on no tiles can be placed further than 3 spaces away from this tile (this creates a 7 by 7 grid when finished).<br/><br/>Players then take alternate turns. On your turn you must choose a tile that is still available and place it on an empty space - up, down, left or right of a tile already placed.<br/><br/>You must place it in any of the 8 possible orientations you wish. The orientation of a tile is indicated by the white arrow in the middle.<br/><br/>Once a tile is placed, check whether it can convert an opponent's tile over to your side - to do so you must fulfill three conditions;<br/><br/>1) your tile must have your color arrow pointing toward your opponent's tile<br/>2) the target opponent tile must not have their color arrow pointing back<br/>3) the two tiles must not share the same orientation<br/><br/>If multiple tiles can be converted at the same time you may only choose one.<br/><br/>The converted tile is flipped over to your side and rotated to the same orientation as one that converted it. You then treat that tile as though it just been placed and check if another conversion can be made. Repeat this process until no further conversion is possible.<br/><br/>Now it is your opponent's turn.<br/><br/>Players will take turn placing and converting tiles back and forth in this manner until all the tiles are placed and the game is over. Count up the total number of tiles for each player; whoever has the most of their color facing up is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Despite its name, this game has nothing to do with Xiangqi, the *real* Chinese Chess.  It does have original mechanics, though.  BGG user chas59 states that the game was designed by Ron Dubrin of Mew York.<br/><br/>The pieces start out filling the 6x6 board except for the central 2x2 area.  Both players move both sets of pieces; the trick is that one player jumps same-coloured pieces whilst the other jumps different-coloured pieces.  Jumped pieces are removed, and the object of the game is to capture 13 pieces.<br/><br/>When you land on same/different-coloured square (there are 12 coloured squares, surrounding the central 2x2 area), you get to go again.  Multiple jumps are possible.  If you cannot jump, you slide, moving like a rook.  Lastly, you cannot move a piece that's just been moved by the opponent.<br/><br/>",

You are one of the few brave enough to venture into this exciting but dangerous new land to research and record new species. The world watches to see the discoveries that will be uncovered. The media has dubbed you and your comrades &quot;The Darwinauts&quot; for daring to go beyond to record the new origins of species. You must work quickly to bring back records of the most exotic lifeforms to secure your place in history, but be careful, the portal is unstable and won't remain open for long... The Rift is coming!<br/><br/>During the course of Darwinauts, a player takes two actions on their turn, selecting from five possible actions: place an explorer, place a tile, replenish tiles and remove explorers, discover a species, and record a species. When recording a species, a player immediately takes one of five possible bonus actions that allow the player to set themselves up for future turns or alter the landscape. Players continue to take turns until The Rift tile is revealed, making the portal to the new world unstable. Once The Rift begins, players add an additional phase to their turns, taking part in dismantling the landscape they have opened up for exploration. The game comes to a close as they race to complete their tasks and return home. When the game ends, players receive prestige points for their recorded species and bonuses are earned for specializing in specific sets of species. The Darwinaut with the most points wins the game and goes down in history as a pioneer in this new age of discovery.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The Ogre seeks to repel these home invaders and save its goods through magic and sword-play.<br/><br/>Ogre Castle is definitely BEST with four players...but it CAN be played with 3 players. Just make these adjustments...<br/>(1) There will be two Knights and one Ogre.  <br/>(2) The Ogre places only the gems matching the Knight colors. <br/>(3) Give the two Knights 4 armor chips each at the start of the game.<br/>(4) Adjust the Ogre's goal to getting 4 gems of any color.<br/>(5) The player who begins a battle draws a magic scroll card when they move away from the battle.<br/><br/>",

The Emperor is powerless and the office of his sworn protector, the Shogun, is an empty shell. The realm is in turmoil as rival Daimyos struggle for control.<br/><br/>Two to four players compete in this fast-playing card game of consolidation and conquest, where each turn and every card play is a decision whether to PLACE a card in your court for a modest but long-lasting effect, or to PITCH a card for a stronger but single use.<br/><br/>Nobunaga realized his ambition and united almost a third of Japan under his rule; only one player can seize enough Provinces, or have all three Regalia, to control the realm.

Dice and tokens for the game are not included and must be supplied by the players.<br/><br/>The game simulates a series of dungeon crawls in search of treasure. Players represent the leaders of various adventuring guilds who choose from one of 3 dungeons that have increasing levels of challenge. They then roll 3D6 to populate the dungeon. After the dungeon is set up, they roll another 3D6 to determine the strength of their party which is made up of a Thief, a Warrior and a Wizard. They choose which die goes to which hero and play progresses between the dungeon taking a turn against the player and the player taking a turn against the dungeon.<br/><br/>Depending on how well a particular adventure goes, the player may be able to purchase a treasure from a list based on the dungeon they chose. Players may choose between treasures that add to victory points, or will give them a magical advantage in the next dungeon adventure.<br/><br/>",

The board represents the machine which distributes newly-minted marbles from the center and funnels them to one of six goal areas at the edge of the board.  The winning player is the one who can manipulate the process to get the most marbles by the end of the day.&quot;<br/><br/>Players manipulate the process by playing Machine Tiles: Machine Parts &amp; Modifiers, or Marbles during their turns. Machine Parts alter the direction or behavior of Marble Tiles that move over them on a turn. Some Machine Part Tiles reverse direction, redirect, push or jump the Marble.<br/>Modifier Tiles allow players to reposition or remove previously played Machine Part Tiles.<br/><br/>Marble Tiles are printed with a directional arrow and a value from 1 to 4. The player positions the arrow in a direction of his choosing in the center of the board. When subsequent marbles are placed, all marbles currently on the board will move in the direction of their arrow the distance identified by their printed value.<br/><br/>Players must play at least one, and at most two, tiles per turn. If a player plays a marble on her first turn, she immediately takes a second turn, playing another marble or a Machine Tile (A machine Part of Modifier).<br/><br/>The game ends when there are no tiles left for a player to draw or a player has met the specified marble quota for the game.

Compete for biodiversity achievements and outmaneuver your opponents by activating the special abilities of your plants and animals. Each action can only be activated once, so think carefully about which actions you take and when.<br/><br/>Rounds of the game move through the seasons, each season having its own thematic impact on the Biome. In the simultaneous gameplay phase, draw cards and collect resources to play a plant or animal into your Biome and earn points. Play your birds and rabbits next to plants, so that in Spring, they will make nests and have chicks and baby bunnies! But beware, in Summer, your opponents' predators are on the prowl. Protect your baby animals by playing more plants in each habitat. Earn points with successful hunts and by feeding your baby animals.<br/><br/>Add the optional Natural Disasters mini expansion (spinner) to bring additional variability and nature's harsh reality to your game of Biome.<br/><br/>With many ways to earn points (and win!) plus multiple difficulty levels, you can tailor your game to your adventure level!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

On a player's turn, they place one of their colored track pieces onto the map.

Pieces are not obligated to be contiguous with previous plays, but if a player ends the game with multiple networks, one will be removed.<br/><br/>After track has been placed, the players look to see if any stations expand.  Each station is worth a number of points equal to how many different lines have connected to it, and once a new line connects, additional wooden station tokens are stacked on top of previous ones.<br/><br/>Each players' score is equal to the value of the stations in their network.<br/><br/>",

Each side of the paper shows an area with 13 hexagons, each filled with a number, surrounded by a ring of 16 hexagons, each filled with a color. Start on whichever side you want; you use both during play.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player rolls three dice, then can re-roll any number of dice once. Each die has the numbers 1-6 with a different color on each side. After the roll, all players use these dice to mark off hexes on their sheet. For each die, you can use either the number or the color; additionally, you can sum numbers on the dice, which will be required since the numbers in the hexes go up to 12.<br/><br/>However, once you mark a colored hexagon, you can mark only the adjacent colored hexagons from that point on. Similarly, when you first mark a number, circle that number. The next number you mark must be in an adjacent hex; draw a line that connects this number to the circle. With each subsequent number marked, you must extend the line, never crossing it or revisiting a marked space.<br/><br/>If the active player can't use all three dice, they mark a misthrow box on their sheet; the same is true for non-active players who don't use at least two dice. When you mark all three misthrow boxes, flip your sheet, then start marking the other side on the next turn; you can also choose to flip your sheet before you get three misthrows.<br/><br/>When any player has three misthrows on their second side, the game ends, and players tally their points for each side, summing those values. The more hexes you mark off, the better your score!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Seven Years' War was the pinnacle of 18th-century warfare, with dramatic campaigns and battles, famous leaders, and wide variety of colourful uniforms. Compared with the later Napoleonic Wars, tactics were simpler, armies more professional, and battles tended to be smaller. Using these quick-to-learn rules, players can bring this period to the tabletop, recreating anything from a small skirmish to a major pitched battle. Although simple, the rules allow for a wide range of tactics and reward historical play. That said, fog of war sometimes produces unexpected results and units don't always obey their orders! The game moves quickly, and players must be prepared to regroup and counterattack or to press home an advantage - a lot can happen in one move!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Fighting Sail: Fleet Actions 1775&ndash;1815 is a tabletop miniatures wargame of fleet battles in the age of canvas, cannon, and timbers. Players take on the roles of fleet admirals in battles ranging from the American War of Independence to the Napoleonic Wars and the War of 1812. Each fleet has access to different ships, tactics, and command personalities - each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Offering a unique blend of detail and simplicity, the scenarios included enable the recreation of historic actions or 'what-if' scenarios.<br/><br/>The rules are designed for 1/1200 scale ship miniatures, although they can be easily adjusted for smaller scales. Game focus is on ships of 6th Rate or above. The game is hex-less, so uses movement and turning templates along with a tape measure or ruler.  Combat and other tests utilize a pool of six-sided dice.<br/><br/>Fighting Sail was designed with a crew-centric approach and has a goal of immersion over simulation. To perform actions players roll a number of dice based on crew and ship capability to test against a target number.  More successes return a better result (more movement, more hits in combat, more damage saves, etc.). The goal of the game is to break the enemy fleet by reducing their morale to zero.  Morale can be lost by taking damage, suffering a collision, or when a ship is taken out of action (by striking, being sunk, or captured in a boarding action).<br/><br/>The Fighting Sail rules include a points-based system for building fleets and balancing scenarios.  The ship/crew capabilities and special rules for eight fleets are detailed in the book (including privateers and pirates).  Six general engagement scenarios are described to get prospective admirals started on their journey into the adventurous age of fighting sail.<br/><br/>",

Use your skills, tools, and imagination to devise foolproof plans and save the day!<br/><br/>The first victim is the person who lives the most dangerously. Each of the other players is called a rescuer. The victim draws and reveals a danger card containing the perilous situation they are caught in. The rescuers then place one skill card and one tool card from their hands which they will utilize to tell a story of how they will save the victim. While a Rescuerer presents their rescue story another can play a plot twist on their cards tripping them up and changing the story for more engaging play. the Victim awards the Danger card to the Rescuer with the best Rescue.<br/><br/>All cards are written for embellishment and lateral thinking. &quot;Able to transform into a rock&quot; well what kind of rock are you?!<br/><br/>",

As the dark cult schemes, however, one of its members is planning an even darker betrayal, one that will tie Tamriel in with Oblivion forever. Adventurers work to uncover her machinations and stop her plot amid a bevy of endlessly replayable content. As in The Elder Scrolls video games, players will travel on an epic journey, balancing exploration, character building, dungeon diving and close quarters combat.<br/><br/>Each adventure in the game takes place over the course of three gameplay sessions, with sessions being roughly one hour per player in length. Players customize and control a single hero throughout all three sessions of an adventure as they manage multiple skill lines, classes and experience the many regions of Tamriel, each with their own unique flavor and mechanics. Experience points are handed out generously, allowing players to build interesting and unique characters in the consolidated timespan required in a tabletop experience. Session to session progression is meaningful, but players are not required to remember complex narrative points or play with the same group forever.<br/><br/>",

Now, the Worlds of Old have become the premier scavenger&rsquo;s hunting grounds, filled with all sorts of valuable treasures left behind by the ancient forgotten kingdoms. You are one such scavenger, venturing into these forsaken lands to seek your fortune! However, gathering these treasures is no easy task, as the disasters that shattered these worlds are still raging, and every disaster brings the total destruction of each planet closer. In order to protect yourself and your treasure, you must salvage the remains of the ancient civilizations and use them to build yourself a mighty castle! But be quick, as the end of the world is not the only obstacle between you and infinite riches. There are other scavengers out there too, and you never know what they will be willing to do to secure that treasure&hellip;<br/><br/>--Preceding description from publisher<br/><br/>In Disastles, there are four types of cards: throne rooms, outer rooms, vaults, and disasters. Each player begins with a throne room and builds a castle. The game ends when 6 disaster cards have been played. The winner is the player who survives the disasters with the most treasure from their vaults.<br/><br/>On your turn you may: play a card from the shop, swap two of your rooms, move one of your outer rooms, or use an action room. Many room cards have text which can be activated by matching the connection point(s) on neighboring room cards. When disasters are drawn, all players immediately take damage. Damage can be mitigated by matched room connections. If a player is unable to negate all the damage, they must sacrifice a room for each point of damage. If a player's throne room is sacrificed the player is eliminated.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Solferino portrays the final battle of the Second Italian War of Independence, a nominal French victory that persuaded Napoleon III to make peace without much attention to the aims of his Italian allies. It was the last battle in Europe (maybe in the world) in which three monarchs commanded armies: the little Napoleon for the French, Victor Emmanuel for the Sardinians and Franz Joseph I for the Austrians.<br/><br/>The scale is 600 meters per hex, 1 hour per turn. Units are infantry and cavalry brigades and corps-level artillery batteries. Units are rated for attack strength, movement factor and cohesion, which represents both morale and the number of losses that the unit can take before dissolving (2 for most infantry and cavalry, 3 for a few, 1 for artillery). Stacking is limited to one unit of any type plus one additional artillery unit per hex. Facing is of no importance for movement but does affect combat: Units may attack only through their 3 front hexes and are penalized if attacked from the flank or rear.<br/><br/>Command and control are of great importance. Most units are attached to higher level formations (corps for the French and Austrians, divisions for the Italians). A unit is in command only if it is within range of its corps/division headquarters and the HQ either is within range of its monarch or passes an initiative test. Out-of-command units aren't helpless but are barred from entering hexes adjacent to enemy units' fronts. The royal and imperial personages, particularly Victor Emmanuel and Franz Joseph, are not very mobile, thus limiting forward movement in what is essentially a huge meeting engagement.<br/><br/>The movement sequence uses the &quot;chit pull&quot; mechanism. Activation chits for each formation (plus a chit for each side representing all of its unattached units) are placed into a cup and drawn to determine which corps's or division's units may move next. The player who wins the initiative (usually the French) has the slight advantage of being able to select the first formation that will move each turn, without having to draw.<br/><br/>Combat is somewhat unusual, employing a system that makes attacks hard and bloody. The attacker's strength is compared to the defense value of the terrain occupied by the defender (1 for clear hexes, 2 for woods, villages and upper slopes, 3 for towns); the defender's strength doesn't matter. At first glance, the combat results table looks very favorable. There are two catches: First, unless an HQ stacks with one of the attackers and passes an initiative test, attacks cannot be combined. The brigades go in one by one. Second, the defender gets to use its own strength for defensive fire against each successive attack before the attacker may fire. A not untypical result of an uncoordinated attack is that each attacker in turn suffers disorder and is forced to fall back without doing any damage. Coordinated attacks work much better - the defender must divide its strength among the attacking units, while they get to add theirs - but, as noted, require the presence of an HQ, which risks the loss of its commander in the process. (He will be replaced, but by a less effective subordinate.) Artillery can help by softening up the target, but there aren't a lot of batteries. (Most of the guns present are abstractly incorporated in the infantry brigade strengths.). Worse yet, they move slowly, have trouble obtaining good lines of sight and are easily eliminated if they get too near the enemy.<br/><br/>As the battle goes on, formations will become demoralized through the loss of more than half of their initial steps. Once demoralized, they can do little except retreat off the field.<br/><br/>Players gain a Victory Point for occupying each of 7 towns and one for every two enemy corps or divisions demoralized. A side can also win instantly by eliminating the enemy Emperor (Napoleon or Franz Joseph), though only a rather careless player will expose his monarch to attack.<br/><br/>The battle starts at dawn (5:00 am) and will usually end abruptly in the late afternoon when a thunderstorm sweeps the field. If the storm holds off, the last turn is 6:00 pm. Whether or not it arrives, oppressive heat almost certainly will, slowing units and lowering their morale.<br/><br/>This game was announced as the first of the series, and a later issue of Vae Victis had a pair of sequels, covering the battles of Magenta (1859, the other big battle of the same war) and Reichshoffen (1870, Franco-Prussian War). There were, however, no more, either because the difficulties of attack frustrated aggressive players or simply owing to a lack of widespread interest in mid-19th Century European wars. Solferino gives us a glimpse of what the American Civil War might have been like if every general had been a McClellan.<br/><br/>",

Find out with ROFL!<br/><br/>ROFL! pits players against each other as they strive to condense messages down to as few characters as possible. To start a turn, players see a phrase card, while the Guesser does not. Players compete with one another to accurately relay the secret message on the phrase card in as few characters as possible. If the Guesser can figure out the original phrase from your clue before time runs out, you both score points!

To do this, players alternately play out combinations and find out how many of them are correct (but without finding out which ones are correct). They can then play an action card that lets them get additional information. These action cards can be neutralized using defense cards. The first player to deduce the right combination and lay it out wins. The game sounds a little like Mastermind, but with the extra cards that can provide more information.<br/><br/>",

You start the game with one card in hand from a deck of sixteen cards. On a turn, you do the following:<br/><br/><br/>         Draw: Draw the top card from the deck and add it to your hand.<br/>         Play: Choose one of the two cards in hand to play and place it face up in front of you.<br/>         Effect: Carry out the played card's effect, after which the card is considered as discarded.<br/>         End: If there is at least one card left in the deck, the turn goes to the next player; if not, the investigation phase starts. Using the investigation speed indicated on the card each player has in hand, players take turns guessing which player (whether yourself or someone else) holds the &quot;Lost Legacy&quot; card; this card might also be in the &quot;Ruins&quot;, a location that holds one card at the start of the game and possibly acquires more cards during play.

The sheep player must save as many sheep as possible, while the wolf must feast on those sheep. Chomp!<br/><br/>Sheep, Dogs and Wolves has two types of game play:<br/><br/><br/>    Duel: The players play two complete games, switching roles after the first game. Whoever saves more sheep wins.<br/>    Bid: Before the game starts, players take turns make increasing bids as to how many sheep they think they can save. The player who passes first plays the wolf; the other player must save at least as many sheep as he bid to win.<br/><br/><br/>To start play, place one tile on the table. Players, starting with the sheep, alternate placing tiles on the table, with each tile needing to fit in an imaginary square grid and being adjacent to at least one already-placed tile. Once all tiles have been placed, the game ends.<br/><br/>To score, first place a counter on each wolf that has at least two dogs orthogonally adjacent to it; these wolves are &quot;scared&quot; of the dogs and won't eat sheep. Next, place a counter on each sheep adjacent at least to one uncovered wolf; these sheep have been eaten by the wolves.

German divisions can break down into kampfgruppen. Armored units can employ special post combat movement rules, depending on their level of mobility. Special operations units will include the Long Range Desert Group, the Brandenburgers, and Italian naval commandos. Players can consult an Appeal to the High Command Table which may bring in additional reinforcements, or trigger loyalty changes in Vichy forces, or trigger the Iraqi coup. There will also be variable scenarios depending on the level of force commitment by both sides.

        "description": "Refight the greatest naval-air-land war of history. USN Deluxe is an update of the classic SPI game of the War in the Pacific, 1941-45. While maintaining the original game&rsquo;s systems, the redesign also includes rules for a comprehensive simulation that includes the entire war, from Hawaii to the Asian mainland. Scenarios include the first year of the Japanese offensive, as well as 1941-43, 1943-45 and 1941-45. There are also mini-games for Midway, the Solomons, Burma, China, the Philippines, Manchuria and others. Also included is a War Plan Orange scenario for a &ldquo;what-if&rdquo; naval war with the US and Japan squaring off in the early 1930s.<br/><br/>Naval forces are at the squadron level, except aircraft carriers, which are each represented by individual counters. Air units are in groups based on squadrons. Land units are regiments, brigades, divisions, corps and armies. The game system uses an interactive sequence of play in which both players can launch strikes, exploit errors, and win great victories. New rules include Kamikazes, armored divisions, task force markers, Soviet intervention, MAGIC, special operations forces, the China front, strategic bombing and the atomic bomb.<br/><br/>Components: 840 die-cut counters, two 34x22&rdquo; maps, player aid cards, and two rulebooks, 2 inch box.<br/><br/>(source: Decision games website)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Forceball is a fast and futuristic sport card game for 2 players. Each match consists of three periods. A period starts with a face-off to decide who's the attacker and who's the defender, and then progresses with the players taking turns either attacking or defending. The period ends when all cards in the deck have been used, and the deck is then reshuffled for the next period.<br/><br/>During a period the attacker uses his attack maneuvers &ndash; Pass, Dribble or Shot &ndash; to try to score a goal. The defender uses his defense maneuvers &ndash; Block, Tackle or Interception &ndash; to try to prevent a goal. If the attacker scores a goal or the defender intercepts the ball, the roles are reversed and the game continues.<br/><br/>In addition to the regular attack and defense maneuvers, the players can use special maneuvers to score a lucky shot or intercept the ball using the goalie. It's also possible to foul by making illegal maneuvers, but beware &ndash; you don't want the referee to see you.<br/><br/>Forceball consists of 56 cards and is a complete game in itself, not a trading card game. The game is easy to learn, easy to carry around in your pocket, and a period takes less than 15 minutes. It's suitable both as a filler and for lengthy tournaments.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Volume III contains 7 Battles:<br/><br/>The New York Campaign :<br/><br/><br/>     Brooklyn (27 Aug 1776). Howe moves his forces onto Long Island and uses a long flanking march to get behind the advance American forces, but does not follow up his victory with an assault on the American main line. Fearing a naval trap, Washington retreats his forces to Manhattan.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Harlem Heights (16 Sep 1776). After positioning new lines at the neck of Manhattan, the British move onto Manhattan and take New York City. On 16 September, an American foraging party runs into a British scouting force and a skirmish begins. Both sides begin sending forces into the developing battle. The Americans push the British back two miles nearly reaching the British camps before being stopped. The American morale, flagging after the defeat and retreat from Brooklyn, was restored. Still, the growing British threat to outflank the Americans forced Washington to fall back.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     White Plains (28 Oct 1776) Historically, the battle ended after a lengthy skirmish on Chatterton Hill between a mixed force of British and Hessians versus American militia and regulars. The slow moving British prepared for a battle three days later, but by then Washington had retreated further north to cross the Hudson River and head south to New Jersey. Howe decided not to pursue and instead seized Ft. Washington. However, there are accounts that suggest that Howe might have assaulted the main American line immediately.<br/><br/><br/>The New Jersey Campaign :<br/><br/><br/>     Trenton (26 Dec 1776) Washington conceives of a bold move to cross the Delaware River and surprise the Hessian outpost in Trenton as a means to gain a victory, and turn the morale of his troops. After crossing the Delaware and marching for several hours in snow and sleet, the force divided into two columns in an effort to surround Trenton, and cut off retreat and reinforcement. The Hessians had no expectation of a surprise attack, and partied late into Christmas night. The American columns managed to emerge almost simultaneously on the few pickets, overwhelming them, and moving in and around Trenton as the Hessians scrambled to defend themselves. In less than two hours, almost the entire 1,400 man garrison was bagged.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Princeton (3 Jan 1777) At the end of 1776, Washington was facing the imminent departure of most of his remaining force. He makes a plea for men to stay on for six more weeks for an additional bounty and was able to pull together 5,000 troops. With these, he crossed the Delaware River into New Jersey again. Sidestepping the British forces marching to Trenton along the main road, the Americans make a back road march towards Princeton. Sending a force to guard a bridge over the main road to slow a British response, this force runs into a trailing British regiment. A battle ensues in a nearby field. The fast marching Americans defeat the British forces, capture supplies at Nassau Court House, and march on to Morristown to winter quarters, but loss General Mercer.<br/><br/><br/>Two Bonus Scenarios!<br/><br/><br/>     Stony Point (16 Jul 1779) Wayne's surprise attack on the Hudson River fort. The Americans went in with only bayonets and cutting equipment. They managed to capture nearly 500 of the 600 man garrison.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     King's Mountain (7 Oct 1780) The rebel militia avenge their defeat at Camden with a decisive defeat of the Tories, ending Cornwallis' attempt to conquer the Southern colonies until the following year..<br/><br/><br/>Components: Two 22 x 34 inch maps, 560 counters, rules book, storage bags and dice.<br/><br/>The easy game system recreates battlefield conditions with a move-fight-rally play sequence to simulate the grand tactics of these battles. Additional rules include command control, morale, artillery, light infantry, and dragoons. Each battle is represented by its own units and map along with exclusive rules to recreate the unique battlefield situation. Units are generally regiments, and rated for combat strength, morale, and march capabilities. Famous leaders are also included-Washington, Howe, Greene, and Knyphausen. Battles range from Bunker Hill, through Brooklyn and Trenton, to Saratoga and Monmouth, and on to the South at Cowpens, Guilford, and King's Mountain.<br/><br/>(from the publisher)<br/><br/>",

You're trying to collect as much gold as possible each round, and the player (team) with the most gold after the predetermined number of rounds wins.<br/><br/>Each round, players start with seven cards in hand; cards feature numbers from 1 to 10, as well as negative numbers, cards that can be either positive or negative, and special plays such as the dragon and wizard. One player leads by playing a card to her &quot;horde&quot; (the table in front of her); if she plays a 1, she can play again immediately. The next player must follow &ndash; playing to his own horde first &ndash; and have an equal or higher total in his horde at the end of his turn. If he can't, he loses the trick; if he can, the opponent gets to play again and play continues back-and-forth until one player loses.<br/><br/>Whoever wins collects 1 gold, plus 1 Gold for each Gold card in the pot. The winner draws one card and either keeps it or keeps the next card in the deck; the loser draws two cards (one of them being the card left by the other player, if any). Play continues until all 16 Gold have been claimed, at which point a winner is determined for the round.<br/><br/>In a four-player game, you and your teammate share a horde and take turns playing into it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game, players attempt to guide an airplane around the world as the calendar progresses from day to day.  Players hold a hand of cards, each stating a city and day-of-the-week combination.  Their goal is to have the plane reach their destination as close to their card's day as possible.  (E.g. if I hold &quot;Paris - Tuesday&quot; then I'd like the plane to reach Paris on Tuesday, not on Saturday--it's worth more points that way).<br/><br/>The method by which the plane moves is based on an auction.  Each round, players bid for the right to choose the plane's next destination (each player starts with a fixed amount of money and cannot earn any money during the game).  Movement is restricted to only adjacent cities.  Sometimes a player will receive a windfall when an opponent pays for the privilege of moving the plane but moves it to a place where it's beneficial to both players.  At other times, a player will see the plane start moving away from the area of the world preferred.<br/><br/>Play continues until all players are out of money or one player has played all of his or her cards.  Most victory points earned (as the cards are played) determines the victor.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    Shanghai<br/>    Maloney's Inheritance<br/><br/><br/>",

On your turn, you must flip one of your seven cards (up or down), with some cards having effects that enable you to flip additional cards, including those owned by opponents. Cards depict animals in different types of environments, and they have different effects and point values depending on what's shown at round's end, such as the sloth which is worth positive points only if it's still face down. Aside from sloths and koalas, though, cards must end the game face up to contribute to a player's score.<br/><br/>In the &quot;Great Tree&quot; variant for 2-4 players, five cards are dealt to each player and two turns are taken. Then a second set of five cards cards are dealt out which go above the first row and two more turns are taken, with the added wrinkle that players now control two rows and adjacency means up and down as well as side to side. Finally, a third set of cards is dealt out and players take a final two turns, then calculate their total score.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The board consists of various fields and camps that are seperated by highways and train tracks.  Each player has two bases located at his end of the board the player's flag goes in one of these bases; a low ranking piece is usually placed in the other as a decoy.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to capture your opponent's flag. Players place their pieces face down on the fields on their side of the board. A third player is required to act as a referee to determine the outcome of fights (which occur when a piece moves into a field with an opposing piece). <br/>Fights are resolved based on the rank of different pieces.  Pieces that are ranked high such as the General or Lieutenant General defeat pieces of lesser rank such as Engineers (Gong Ping) and Sergeants.  There are two special tiles - a mine which destroys anyone who attacks it (with the exception of a Engineer), the missile which can kill any unit and in the process destroys itself.<br/><br/>Camps remain vacant at the start of the game and remain vacant until a piece occupies them.  Pieces that remain within a bunker are protected from attack while those on fields are not.<br/><br/>Similar Games Include:<br/><br/>    Stratego<br/>    Hai Lu Kong Zhan Qi<br/>    Si Guo Da Zhan<br/>    Dong Wu Qi<br/><br/><br/>",

The Battle of Tours is a fast-playing, fun game of low complexity. To that end, much detail has been either omitted or factored into the overall mechanics. We have tried to provide as much period flavor and historical accuracy as we can, within that focus. The game should take about two hours to play to conclusion, about 50% more the first time.<br/><br/>Now, Turning Point Simulations gives you the chance to determine the future of France and Western Europe, with a tactical system which highlights the different strengths and weaknesses of both sides. For the Muslims, you&rsquo;ll find them lightly armored, cavalry heavy, and prone to piecemeal attacking by tribes. The Frankish army is a century before Charlemagne, caught in transition from Roman heavy infantry tactics and the birth of armored knights. It is mobility versus defense, Moorish spears versus Frankish long swords. And you make the decisions.<br/><br/>The Battle of Tours includes 100 counters that capture the widely varying weapons systems at this battle. You&rsquo;ll find both light and heavy infantry, light and heavy cavalry, and (a few) mounted archers. But beyond unit types, you&rsquo;ll command troops who actually fight &quot;differently&quot; from each other. Muslim units are activated by &quot;tribes,&quot; as a collection of varied unit types that all happen to move together. Frankish units activate by type&mdash;all the heavy infantry, all the light infantry, all the cavalry. The difference means the two armies &quot;feel&quot; different to command. Players designate basic &quot;orders&quot; by selecting counters, then find out who obeys. The chaos and lack of real control conveys an historic chaos that really captures the flavor of this battle, where failure can mean slaughter, but victory can mean losing control, as troops turn from soldiers to looters.  You can be up one turn and down the next. Hang on for the ride.<br/><br/>Part of the TPS &quot;Decisive Battles&quot; series<br/>That means straightforward rules, key insights into the history behind the game, and designs aimed at one-session conclusions and high replay value. With shifting Initiative and uncertain activations, no two Tours games will play the same.<br/><br/>",

However, they also must work together against a common enemy, the Raiders! The key is to send the right amount of troops out to protect the region, while also keeping a few at home to developed their skills for future rounds.<br/><br/>SoS uses simultaneous play and an average game takes about 45 minutes or less to play.

It's the 4th in my xx72 line of 1-page micro games.<br/><br/>This game differs from its predecessors by increasing theme and putting much more emphasis in journaling and storytelling. Similar to a legacy or campaign game but in a more sandbox feel, and with multiple storylines and endings to maintain high replay value.<br/><br/>The game PDF consists of 1 (consumable) Player Sheet and 7 pages of rules and storyline, all in a black and white low ink format. It takes less than a minute to set up a game.<br/><br/>You are a small tribe of Montanan Crow that are trying to make your way to Canada to avoid the upcoming conflict between the United States and the loose alliance of Native tribes.<br/><br/>As per the setting in the game:<br/>The Tribes have met and decided on war. You refuse to subject your Crow people to such a lost cause. A vision warned you that the Americans spill blood of many tribes on this frontier.

The fiercest fighting occurred to the north and east of Mortain at Hill 314 (hex 1501 on the game map) where surrounded Americans of the 2nd Battalion of the 120th Regiment threw back repeated German attacks. Control of the high ground here would make the Mortain position nearly untenable, and with it the main Allied supply route from Normandy south would be severed.<br/><br/>Stand at Mortain is a mini-game complete with map, rules and counters.

You've been searching for a long time and now you're pretty sure that mysterious creatures from lore really exist! However, in order to convince the editor-in-chief and make it to the front page with your story, you will need some solid evidence. You'll have to keep searching and following even the smallest rumours until the signs get hot. But time is of the essence because your competitors have become aware of the story...<br/><br/>There are 6 different creatures who are said to be found in different locations around the world &ndash; referred to as &quot;mysteries&quot;. For each mystery, there are 6 rumours and each is assigned a unique colour and symbol.<br/>The rumours have different values ranging from -1 to 4. The higher the value of a rumour, the higher the probability that the mystery truly exists.<br/>Only one of these cards is the actual proof of the respective mystery - you must find out its value throughout the course of the game. This evidence is hidden under the overview cards and its value is unknown to you at the beginning of the game. All other cards are rumours. You hold these rumours in your hands and play them round by round, revealing information to everyone.<br/><br/>Throughout the course of the game, you will take search cards by performing the &quot;Search&quot; action. These represent your findings on the various mysteries.<br/>Time-outs in the basic game allow you to exchange previously collected search cards in one mystery for another. These cards grant you the opportunity to bluff or alter wrong decisions.<br/>The professional tools of the variant introduce 6 unique actions into the game and take the game to a more strategic level.<br/><br/>",

For the first turn, the player takes any two cards, swaps them, then sums these numbers (summing the numbers again if the sum is larger than nine). For example, if the player swaps cards 6 and 8, their sum is 14, and the sum of those numbers is 5. For the next swap, the player must swap card 5 with some other card. If the player places the cards in descending order from 9-1, she wins.<br/><br/>The cards in Flip 9 are double-sided, though, and should you become at ease with the basic game, you can advance to the harder one. To start, flip half the cards to show the other side, then lay them out in a row. Each turn you'll still swap two cards, with every swap after the first having one of the cards being determined by the sum of the previous swap &mdash; but now you must also flip over the two cards being swapped. To win, you must place the cards in descending order from 9-1 and have the same side face up on all of the cards.<br/><br/>",

Each player discards this number of cards and in the order of play, players take the cards of their choice. The slave discards the remaining cards.<br/><br/>The Imperator then plays a combination of cards (one or more cards of the same value, the cards being numbered from 1 to 13). The next player may pass or play the same number of cards but of higher value. This is played until no one wants (or can) beat the current combination. The player who placed this combination starts the next round.<br/><br/>Brutus is the weakest card in the game but it is the only card that can beat the strongest card that is ... Caesar. And we can play any card on Brutus, which can only be played on Caesar.<br/><br/>If the winning combination has a value between 9 and 13, it triggers an effect in favor of the player who asked it (discard cards, give cards to his opponents, earn points ...).<br/><br/>When a player no longer has a card in hand, he scores points of glory that vary according to the number of players and takes the Position card corresponding to his place (from the first Imperator to the last Slave).<br/><br/>When only one player remains with cards (who becomes the new slave), the round is over. After several rounds (to be defined at the beginning of the game), the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>Not the same game as Brutus: The Board Game<br/><br/>",

Facing an Allied army 72,000 men strong, he blocked a massive Allied flanking movement aimed at his right wing, launched an attack that smashed the Allied center, and then scattered the remnants so thoroughly that by the night of December 2nd the Allied Third Coalition was in ruins.<br/><br/>The battle contained many moments of high drama: the French right wing holding on despite 3-to-1 odds, desperately waiting for help from Davout's corps rushing to the battlefield after an epic forced march; a massive cavalry melee fought on the northern half of the field between the opposing cavalry reserves; the clash of the French and Russian Imperial Guards on the Pratzen Heights that decided the course of the battle.<br/><br/>Austerlitz 1805 is a detailed wargame, on a tactical level, with infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries, featuring...<br/><br/><br/>     A chit-based Command system where players randomly draw command chits to determine which division or corps may activate at that moment -- activation is not automatic. Commanders must roll to activate when their chit is drawn, and missing the die-roll leads to the Command Breakdown Table -- disasters can happen. <br/>     A Combat system that includes all of the detail that fans of Napoleonic tactics know and love. All of the formations are there -- line, column, skirmish -- each with their own advantages and disadvantages. Players will soon learn that proper unit interaction is crucial for victory, with artillery wearing down the enemy line, infantry creating a breakthrough, and cavalry exploiting the breakthrough with a thundering charge. <br/>     Special units and rules to add a distinctive historical flavor: the Tirailleurs Po and Tirailleurs Corse, elite battalions of French skirmishers; the exotic Mamelukes of the French Imperial Guard, matched against the Russian Cossacks; the fearsome French Grand Battery; the early morning Fog that blanketed the battlefield and so bedeviled the battle's opening moves. <br/>     Six scenarios -- two full-battle scenarios; three smaller one or two map scenarios covering the significant actions, plus a learning scenario providing an introduction to the game's mechanics. <br/><br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 20 minutes<br/>Hex: 150 yards / 137 meters<br/>Units: infantry battalions, cavalry regiments, and artillery batteries<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 4-8 hours<br/><br/>",

There are also holy men and demons that can help or oppose to solving these conflicts.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to achieve the highest possible number of Virtue Points (VP). There are several ways to get VP, and consequently there are several strategies one can follow to win the game: solve conflicts, cause demons to disappear, help other RAGAMI, to be the RAGAMI who has solved the highest number of conflicts, etc.<br/><br/>But helping people to solve their conflicts is what worths more VPs, and for this you need to have Points of Strength. As many as the strength of the conflict you're trying to solve, which can go from 1 to 6. There are several ways to get Points of Strength: white cubes, cards, holy men, the help of another RAGAMI, or a die.<br/><br/>There are Action Dies (which allow to execute a certain number of actions, and it's placement will be made by the last player in the turn order) and there are Action Cards (that may be acquired during the game). In his play, Player can do one of the following actions: move his RAGAMI, move the holy men and the demons, pick cards or solve conflicts.<br/><br/>Game ends in the turn when the places of conflicts ends or when a player hit's the 30 points score mark.<br/><br/>Game to 2 to 4 players, 10 years up, 60 - 90 min.<br/><br/>",

Your Marines are tough but isolated as the Japanese build up around you.  Your biggest asset is Henderson Field, a small airstrip that gives you control of the sea lanes during the day; at night, the Japanese sneak in boats with men and supplies, and sometimes bombard the field directly.  You must weigh the various threats against you and defend the island until relief comes.<br/><br/>In the two-player game you take the role of the Japanese commanders, trying to take back Guadalcanal or of Vandegrift, the American commander, trying to hold on to Henderson Field.  The status of Henderson Field depends primarily on the state of the runway, which the Americans are constantly trying to improve while the Japanese bombard it by air, land, and sea.  As the Japanese player your troops slowly arrive, and it is difficult to build enough force to gain a clear advantage.  Also, the Marine artillery and light tanks with Vandegrift are a decisive factor when they are able to engage in battle.  You must always use the jungle and fog of war to hide your troops as they maneuver for attack against the Marine perimeter around Henderson Field.  Also, you have one advantage, your navy, which can bombard the Marine positions.  As Vandegrift, you must protect the airfield from Japanese attack and bombardment.  If they are able to close in and bring their artillery into range of the airfield all is lost.<br/><br/>",

The game covers the desert battles around El Alamein from July 1 through July 18, 1942. The British Commonwealth 8th Army must hold the line against the battered Panzerarmee Afrika, since Alexandria and the virtually undefended Nile Delta lie less than 100 miles to the east.<br/><br/>The map depicts the battlefield of El Alamein, from the Mediterranean Sea in the north, to the virtually impassable Qattara Depression in the south.<br/><br/>The game system tries out some unusual mechanics to simulate the fast-paced flow of desert warfare. Combat units are rated for firepower and assault strength, while AFVs have an armor rating, and artillery has an anti-tank rating.  HQs are used for activation of units in their formation. Rules of interest are Opportunity Fire, Overruns, Reaction Movement and Withdrawal Fire, Airstrikes and Fortifications.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by points gained through objective hexes, enemy units eliminated, and for occupying portions of the 'coast road'... the player with the most points wins. The difference in points between the Commonwealth and Axis player determines the level of victory.<br/><br/>Originally published by SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #105.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 1.5 miles<br/>Unit: Company to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 16&quot; X 21&quot; mapsheet<br/>One countersheet (100 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 12 page rules booklet<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the earliest known racing game that does not use dice for the engine, or even contain any elements of luck (according to Parlett and others). A 2nd edition was never published. It was reviewed by Phil Orbanes in Games and Puzzles Magazine #68 under the heading of &quot;Great Games that Never Made It.&quot; It has been modified slightly and released as a kit by Paul Jefferies, who renamed it Sack to fit his newly applied theme. In addition to Games and Puzzles #68 (reprinted in Games International (Issue 4 – April 1989)) and Parlett's The Oxford History of Board Games, Bantu has recently been discussed in Abstract Games Magazine.<br/><br/>This is a racing game. The track is circular, with four lanes, with some interaction and crossing over between lanes. Each player (2-4) has four pawns numbered 1-4. This number indicates the distance the pawn may move per turn, and where it may be entered onto the board (the fastest pawn (4) must travel the full distance, but each successively slower pawn travels one fourth less distance than its predecessor, so that the (1) pawn travels only one quarter of the board). Pawns may not jump others nor may two pawns occupy the same space. Ending a turn on a space occupied by an opponent's pawn causes the opponent's pawn to be returned to its starting position.  Pawns of any ownership that lie on spaces connected by a shaded background add their values together for determining movement. So a (red 1), (blue 4), (green 3) that all lie within the same shaded area would  give the first pawn to move, 8 spaces.  A player must use all movement without retracing his path on that turn.  If the player can not use the entire movement then the pawn can not be moved.  If none of his pawns may be moved the entire amount then the player forfeits that turn. First to bear all pawns off wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "HOOK: The movies Alien and Escape from Alcatraz meet 3-Card Monte meet the spin cycle of your washing machine!<br/>HOOK: Only the player with the best Plan B will Escape because Plan A never survives the MoonQuake!<br/><br/>In MoonQuake Escape, get ready to face the challenges of the spinning, changing 3D surface of the doomed prison planet of Zartaclaton. A massive MoonQuake grants you sudden freedom from your captivity, but there's only one way to Escape--the last rescue rocket, and you need to reach it before the other players.  Use the rotating and revolving 3D moon to gather charges and decide which actions will best meet your goal: finding and stopping others players, readying or stealing key equipment, or finding better ways to hide.  Along the treacherous journey, watch out for shifting and dangerous terrain, out of control defenses, and a relentless prison guard that are out to end your sentence--for life!<br/><br/>Finding and stopping the other players is your best plan, but each is hiding amongst decoys and traps.  Player interaction focuses on a risk fraught variation of the classic 3-card Monte combined with a thematic &quot;Bluffing&quot; component that completely reverses the &quot;Take That&quot; mechanic.  Can you use protective shields to lure opponents into picking the wrong hiding spot and keep your own plan from backfiring?  Reach the rocket and prepare for a climactic battle--will you be prepared to capitalize on unexpected turn of events? Be the first to launch during the MoonQuake and you've Escaped the competition!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the editor's website:<br/><br/>Hinge of Fate is primarily meant to examine the strategic alternative history possibilities inherent in the campaign that could&rsquo;ve occurred within Poland and the Rhineland in September 1939 if the French had resolved to keep their promise to launch a &ldquo;major offensive&rdquo; into Germany within a week after that nation invaded Poland. The action in that scenario is fought on two maps, East and West, and also allows for the possibility of a last-minute change of side by Stalin. It can be played by two, three or four. There is also a smaller (one map) Historical Scenario, which is played only on the East Map. It can be played by one or two. Both sides&rsquo; orders of battle are entirely historical in both scenarios. The main body of rules is written with the alternative history scenario in mind.<br/> Each game turn represents three days. Each hex on the West Map represents eight miles from side to opposite side, while the corresponding figure on the East Map is 16 miles. Each counter typically represents an army or occasionally a corps.<br/> Also included with this game are bonus and errata counters for Rhineland War,South Seas Campaign, Afrika Korps, Sedan, Partisan ,and Patton&rsquo;s First Victory.<br/><br/>Components: One 22&quot; x 34&quot; map &amp; 176 counters<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this light family game 2-4 players develop the same city. Monopolis grows by adding new building tiles, which players mark with their small houses to indicate ownership. The bigger the city, the more prestige points it can provide.<br/>Players have two optional actions in a turn: to buy resources on the market and to expand Monopolis by adding a new building tile. They can do both in any order, or the same action twice. There are specific resource requirements for inserting a new building tile. These are shown on collectible demand tokens of various colors, placed randomly to the edges of the tiles already on the board. Players can build a desired building by spending the necessary resources and placing their house on the new tile. The houses are stored on their personal board, and when removed, immediate bonuses become available.<br/>There are 5 types of building tiles, some cheaper, others more expensive to build, and the benefits and victory points they provide differ accordingly. Residential areas and parks are the easiest to implement, while business districts will have a positive impact on the value of adjacent areas and vice versa. Public functions require higher investment but they give bonuses and other benefits, and some institutions provide more prestige points.<br/>The city of Monopolis spans an area of up to 7x7 tiles. The game ends with the round when one of the players runs out of houses. The end-game scores are based on the values of the tiles built and the sets of icons collected, but additional points can be earned in a number of ways.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>K&ouml;nnyed, csal&aacute;di j&aacute;t&eacute;k, amelyben 2-4 j&aacute;t&eacute;kos egyetlen k&ouml;z&ouml;s v&aacute;rost &eacute;p&iacute;t  &ndash; preszt&iacute;zspontok&eacute;rt versenyezve.

But our game contains much more than this. It also gives the opportunity to carry through actions which did not happen, for example - The Germans' landing in England or the breaking through of the Allies in the Balkans.<br/><br/>Moreover, 'Struggle for Europe' actually includes 8 games in one:<br/> 1. Sickle-cut. (Hitler's strategy to occupy France)<br/> 2. Barbarossa plan. (Hitler's strategy to occupy Moscow, etc.)<br/> 3. Military operations 'Bagration and Overlord'. (The Allies terms for 2 separate plans to land in Europe and occupy Berlin)<br/> 4. The entire campaign in Europe and Northern Africa.<br/> Each of the above has 2 versions, one for beginners and one for advanced players.<br/>The game is played on a mapboard printed on both sides.<br/>The conditions for victory of the different participating countries (i.e. players) vary, for example, Italy could remain neutral and still win the game, even if the Allied troops occupy Berlin.<br/><br/>All the elements of warfare can be found in this game - infantry, armed troops, navy, airforce, paratroops, bombers, artillery*, planes and submarines represented by about 200 markers. The battles are settled in a simple and clearly defined way. Long-term strategic planning plays an important role and players are also obliged to make decision in financial matters.<br/><br/>[*There are no artillery pieces in the game.

        "description": "Z-G is a combination miniatures wargame/collectible card game. The miniatures, which represent arena combat robots, are actually 5&quot; action figures with 14 points of articulation and 8 pieces of removable armor. Each piece of armor has a corresponding collectible card giving its statistics and special powers. Each basic set includes a fixed 10 card set (1 card per piece of equipment, including the figure itself, plus a character card)<br/><br/>The game is played in rounds, which start with all players choosing which 3 pieces of equipment to use this round. Each piece of equipment also has an impulse rating, and whoever has the highest impulse goes first. Players then use their cards to move their figure a number of card lengths and/or use attacks based on a color-matching system on the ends of each card. If your attack is successful, a piece of your opponent's armor is destroyed (and so is its corresponding card).<br/><br/>One of the more innovative parts in all this is that the actual figure poses have bearing on gameplay. Movement points must be used to enter a stance, and each stance has certain advantages and disadvantages (Except lying down, which is universally bad)<br/><br/>Z-G was first shown publicly for sale and demonstration at Origins 2001 in Columbus, Ohio, with the subtitle &quot;Citizen.&quot; Although planned as the first set in a series of sets, &quot;Citizen Z-G&quot; was ultimately the only published set.<br/><br/>",

Each player has a force composed of a number of Units, each of which in turn includes a number of individual figures, with weapons chosen from a short list of generic weapon types (it's simple to add more or detail the existing ones). A player is allowed to activate his units one at a time until he fails an activation roll, at which time play passes to the opponent. Units which have not moved, or fail to activate, are able to use reaction fire. Movement is measured from a short list of available actions, run, walk, assault, etc. Combat is resolved using a die roll-savings throw mechanic, with saving throws only if the target wears armor. Hits result in Suppression or Casualties, with more experienced units able to take more suppression hits before casualties are inflicted. vehicles are treated generically, but with a choice of armor &amp; weapons.<br/><br/>Force list, weapon choices and vehicle details are left to the player, although fan-produced lists have been posted on the game website.<br/><br/>FUBAR has a range of rules and supplements including these genre:<br/><br/>    FUBAR 40K Boarding Actions - Space Hulk and Space Crusade<br/>    FUBAR Generic Sci-Fi<br/>    FUBAR Stargate1<br/>    FUBAR Star Wars - Hoth battle <br/>    FUBAR Clone Wars<br/>    FUBAR Starship Troopers<br/>    FUBAR Steampunk<br/>    FUBAR Warhammer 40K<br/>    FUBAR Warzone<br/>    FUBAR Hammers Slammers<br/>    FUBAR Imperial Commander<br/>    FUBAR 15mm SciFi<br/>    FUBAR Micro FUBAR - 6mm scale<br/>    FUBAR Vietnam<br/>    FUBAR WW2<br/>    FUBAR Afghanistan<br/>    FUBAR Horror <br/><br/><br/>",

To set up the simmering cauldrons at the start of the game, you place the top six cards of the deck into three columns of two cards. The special actions consist of jokers and enchantments, and two of these cards are placed face-up; a joker can replace any ingredient, while an enchantment allows you to:<br/><br/><br/>     Select one ingredient of your choice <br/>     Switch up to five ingredients of the same color with an opponent<br/>     Steal one ingredient from the cauldron <br/>     Discard up to five ingredients<br/><br/><br/>During your turn, you take one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Add ingredients: Place one ingredient in each cauldron, after which if each cauldron has two ingredients of the same color or value, you can take one ingredient from any cauldron.<br/>     Taste a potion: Take all the ingredients of the same color or value from one cauldron.<br/>     Cast a spell: Discard the proper mix of ingredients in order to cast a spell. The big Megalos, for example, is composed of nine ingredients of a single color and is so rare that casting it allows you to win the game instantly. The Pentos requires five different ingredients of the same value, and casting it ends the current round. The Mikkros, composed of three ingredients of the same value or three of the same ingredient in consecutive values, allows you to take two special action cards.<br/><br/><br/>When a player casts a Pentos or the ingredient deck runs out, the round ends, although players with ingredients in hand can still play card suits of the same color. Each ingredient in a suit earns you 1 Ko&acirc;, while an isolated ingredient is worth its value in Ko&acirc;s.<br/><br/>After three rounds or a Megalos spell, the game ends. In the latter case, the Megalos-casting player wins; in the latter, the player with the most Ko&acirc;s is immediately turned into a toad.<br/><br/>",

The intermediate game applies aggregate offensive and defensive ratings for the NFL/AFL team of each player's choice. The advanced game permits each side to use the individual stats for each NFL/AFL football player.<br/><br/>This game was published under the title &quot;Vince Lombardi's Game&quot; in 1970 and 1973, and under the name &quot;Be a Pro Quarterback!&quot; in 1971.<br/><br/>The latter variant is a bit of an oddity. The cover lists the maker as Sportsgames, the instructions list the maker as Sports Games, and the board lists the maker as RGI. Whoever published that edition, &quot;Be a Pro Quarterback!&quot; served as an odd placeholder between RGI's 1970 and 1973 Vince Lombardi football games. The rules of the game are the same as for the 1970 &quot;Vince Lombardi Game&quot; edition; only the players are different.<br/><br/>See also the 1967 version &quot;Fran Tarkenton's Pro Football&quot; by RGI, using the same plays and cards, but in a much higher quality format. (The cards are thick board, laminated, and backed with light felt. The plays board is full color on a stand, laminated so the play differentials can be listed by each play in grease pencil. That version also includes a down maker and a ten yard marker.)<br/><br/>",

Players try to manage and effectively use those aliens' relationships &ndash; whether to eat opponents, create new alien babies, trade goods, and so on &ndash; to their advantage for profit. Races are also determined by their size and shape, and planets are too small for everyone...<br/><br/>Space Bastards is probably the first game with a relationship management system. Relationships &ndash; that is, defined relations between two races of aliens &ndash; are connected to the game actions of the players. Players use these relationships to occupy planets and have a majority there. Relationships are: Love (born new alien - Bastard), Hungry (eat enemy alien bastard - enemy is removed from the planet), War (shot enemy alien bastard which dead body will fill the planet), Trade, Friendship, Migration (traveling by spaceship), Mutation (transform to a different alien) and Political propaganda (changing the relationships).<br/><br/>Space Bastards is a game in which you can enjoy and observe the picturesque aliens as small animals in an aquarium &ndash; while siccing them on your opponents, of course...<br/><br/>",

Try to best your friends as you place pieces, discover new rules, change the board, and occasionally realize you're playing an entirely different kind of game. In CBGtCG, we take the nonsense of cracking into a new board game alongside your friends and condense it into a competitive 15 minute game for 3-6 players.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to be the first player to clear their Holdings of 5 random Piece cards. On a turn, each player has 2 Phase Points to spend which can be used to play Pieces on the Board or game mechanics from their hand (Rules, Board States, Events, and Win Conditions). Each Piece can be played on one other Piece in a rock-paper-scissors format. Hats are worn by Soldiers. Soldiers ride Sheep. Sheep are abducted by Spaceships. Spaceships obliterate Castles. And Castles, Hat. Board States dictate the locations that players may play their Pieces on the board. Rules add new regulations to the game that everyone must follow. Events are one-time actions that help you or hurt your friends. Win Conditions provide one player with a new, secret way to win the game.<br/><br/>",

The game is then played in five rounds over which the two Attorneys debate and argue the case chosen by the Judge by playing pieces of Evidence from their hand and calling Witnesses to the testify. Each piece of Evidence and each Surprise Witness is determined by a card, but it is up to the individual players to decide how they fit into the narrative by continuing to tell a story around the card being played.<br/><br/>Jury members will align themselves with one of the attorneys, and, at the end of the 5th round, the Judge will call for a vote.

        "description": "An 18xx game originally designed in 1987 by Michael Liebetanz as 1830: Railways & Robber Barons on a new map for France.  In 1997 Helmut Ohley produced a variant set of rules for 18FR which introduced ports, the special track-tiles, etc. In 2009 J C Lawrence in collaboration with Helmut Ohley updated 18FR, extending and clarifying Helmut's original variant into a more interesting game.  Both variants require additional components to 1830: Railways & Robber Barons to play (files are provided to make your own) and assumes familiarity with the 1830: Railways & Robber Barons rules.<br/><br/>Though this uses components of 1830 this is not an expansion, but is a separate standalone game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The six sons of the Sultan have come to you, the foremost tea merchants in land, with a request:<br/><br/>Provide us with the best exotic teas the world has to offer and we will reward you richly (we may even favor you with special privileges if you impress us), but only one of you can become Chief Tea Merchant of the Sultanate!<br/><br/>Six Sons of the Sultan is a game for two players that takes about 15-20 minutes. Players will have 10 rounds to gain prestige by supplying different kinds of tea to the Sultan&rsquo;s sons. Each type of tea has different costs and prestige points associated with it as well as special actions that may help the players during the game.<br/><br/>There is also a solitaire play option.<br/><br/><br/>The game uses only 9 cards, 3 dice and some eurocubes. It can be printed, however, as a single page game board<br/><br/>Phase 1 - The Dice Roll<br/>The start player begins the round by rolling all 3 dice (Note: in consecutive rounds each player will only roll two dice, having had one die passed to them previously). Once the dice are rolled they are assigned as follows:<br/><br/>One die is chosen as the Order Die, the die number corresponding to 1 of the 6 Tea Card numbers.<br/><br/>One die is then chosen as the Wealth Die, and will increase a player&rsquo;s total wealth by the amount shown on the die.<br/><br/>The final die is the Passing Die and is passed to the other player. This die is locked and may not be rolled during the next player&rsquo;s turn unless the player uses the White Tea card&rsquo;s special action.<br/><br/>Phase 2 - The Tea Order<br/>The player may now place orders on the Tea Card that matches the Order Die&rsquo;s number, thus pleasing one of the Sultan&rsquo;s sons. A player may move their eurocube token up the card&rsquo;s track as many spaces as they are able to pay for (the bottom number denotes the price), moving their token on the Wealth card accordingly. If a player has (0) wealth they may not place an order this turn.<br/><br/>Spaces on the track also have a Prestige Point value which is totalled up at the end of the game (the top number shown for the space).<br/><br/>Certain marked spaces also allow the player to use the Special Action of that card. If a player can afford to move their token up a number of spaces, passing more than one Special Action space, only the final space landed on is counted. The space must be landed on to use the Special Action. The player does not have to use the Special Action if they do not want to.<br/><br/>Phase 3 - Wealth Gained<br/>The player may now move their Wealth token the number of spaces as indicated on the Wealth Die.<br/><br/>The player&rsquo;s turn is now over and the opposing player takes the remaining two dice and rolls them to begin their turn.<br/><br/>Once both players have had a turn, the round is over, the round token is moved down one space on the Time Card and a new round begins.<br/><br/>Game End<br/>Play continues for a total of 10 rounds. When the 10th round is finished, players add up their respective Prestige Points to determine who will be the Chief Tea Merchant of the Sultanate. If the game ends in a tie, the player with the most accrued wealth is the winner.<br/><br/><br/>Released in the September 2018 Board Game of the Month Club $10+ package.<br/><br/>",

You arrive with other daring heroes on a secluded island shrouded in mystery. You have to travel through deep dark forests and sunny glades alike to reach the Dark Citadel. As you march through the woods, you encounter various guardians, from small trained animals to huge powerful monsters.

In ancient times, a group of five elderly people collectively made decisions for the village. In this game, you take on the role of the panchayat and help turn the barren land into the most blossoming village. Will you succeed in making your village the best?<br/><br/>Each round of Panchayat consists of choosing two building tiles, placing the building tiles on your village board, and scoring points. When you select tiles to place on your village board, you also get the ability to hide some of the unused tiles. Points are earned by placing building tiles near or in natural landscapes, near other buildings, or at the end of the game.<br/><br/>You can also earn points from three types of bonus tiles: placement bonus, adjacency bonus, and endgame bonus. While you balance all of this, you also need to consider placing building tiles in their groups of commercial, industrial, utility, and residential sections.<br/><br/>The game lasts eight rounds, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Insidious Sevens is a trick-taking game in which players predict how many tricks they will win each round. The deck consists of 40 cards, numbered 0-7 in five colors, with the colors ranked on the cards: purple (high), blue, green, yellow, red (low). Note that all 7s are higher than any 6, which are each higher than any 5, and so on.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, each player is dealt seven cards. Players pass 0-3 cards to their left or right neighbor depending on the round number. Players then predict the number of tricks they'll take by choosing a card in their hand and simultaneously revealing them. The player with the highest bid becomes start player for the round, and the color of that player's card indicates the trump suit for that round. These bidding cards are then returned to the players' hands.<br/><br/>The start player for a trick lays down a card, and each player must follow the lead by playing a card of the same color or number. If this isn't possible, they can play any card. The highest trump card played (if any) wins the trick; otherwise the highest card played that followed the lead (including number!) wins the trick. After seven tricks, the round ends. Making one's bid nets two points plus the number of tricks bid, while missing results in a loss of one point for every under- or over-trick. The player with the highest score after seven rounds wins.<br/><br/>An optional rule forbids the bids from summing to seven. If this occurs, the player with the highest bid scores one point, then the bid cards are set aside and players rebid from the cards remaining in hand. This process can repeat until the total of bids made does not equal seven.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Road to Enlightenment gives players control of great scientists, artists, philosophers, religious leaders, politicians, and military leaders, bringing them uniquely and individually to life. You play as one of the great monarchs from 17th and early 18th century Europe representing one of the seven top powers of the era: Austria, England, France, Poland, Russia, Spain, or Sweden. Your objective is to be recognized as the most prestigious monarch by producing the most admired art and culture, lead the continent in scientific innovations, spread or resist the spread of Catholicism, and attempt military expansion beyond your historical borders. All of this is accomplished by marshaling 134 historical &quot;luminaries&quot; &ndash; important historical figures covering every relevant domain of human achievement during the period.<br/><br/>The luminaries are rated in between one and seven different areas of endeavour: military, politics, religion, ideas, science, art, or wealth. Additionally, each luminary has a unique Action, Enhancement, or Response based on their real historical achievements to be brought to bear in service of your nation.<br/><br/>Consider the difference between Rembrandt and Vermeer: Both are important and wonderful artists, but in the real-life Dutch Republic, Rembrandt was famous and well-patronized, composing hundreds of celebrated portraits in his career. Vermeer was obscure and produced an order of magnitude less art in his career. In Road to Enlightenment, Rembrandt has higher ratings and gives you a benefit every single time another luminary is removed from the game, reflecting the influence and nature of his portraiture. On the other hand, Vermeer provides only a modest benefit to reflect the limited impact his career had at the time.<br/><br/>Invading other countries in the 17th century was a complex mix of cultural, religious, and logistical considerations. These have all been baked into the various territories on the map, making it quick and easy to make decisions around where to try to attack:<br/><br/><br/>     You can attempt to invade only those territories that have your nation's colour on the top of the circle. Those are the only nations that could have even possibly successfully invaded that territory in real-life.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The number associated with each nation's colour indicates how difficult it would be to successfully conquer. In the case of London, it is very difficult for Spain, France, or Sweden to conquer it.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The religious symbol in the lower left corner lets the player know whether the territory is primarily Catholic, primarily Anti-Catholic (Protestant, Russian Orthodox, and other Christian branches), or primarily Islamic. If it is successfully invaded by a nation with a different religious affiliation, it has an impact on the continental struggle between religions.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The lines connecting into London, and the anchor with an &quot;A&quot; in the lower right corner, indicate which territories need to be held by a player before they have access to attack. The anchor with an &quot;A&quot; indicates that any player who already owns another Atlantic port territory is connected and could choose to attack over the water.<br/><br/><br/>With Road to Enlightenment, all of the intricacies related to managing military expansion have been baked into these easy-to-use board mechanisms.<br/><br/>In order to create a game that simulates the battle between nations for prestige &ndash; covering war, politics, religion, science, and art &ndash; while focusing on many of the diverse people of history, we've mashed up aspects from wargames, Euro games, deck-building games, and statistical sports simulations. While it is an eclectic mix, this broad spectrum approach to the game's design enabled this diverse and richly detailed set of conditions to come together in a game that is epic in scale but doesn't take all day to play.<br/><br/>The full game is for 3-7 players; the pocket version is for 2-4.<br/><br/>",

Teams earn points for correctly answering questions. For each point scored the team advances one square on the board. The first team to get round the board once wins.<br/><br/>Each team randomly draws three category tiles and arranges them on the board according to how knowledgeable they think they are in this particular area. A team will usually put the tile with their &quot;worst&quot; category in the first slot and their &quot;best&quot; category in the third slot. If they answer the question from their first category correctly, they score one point, two for the second, and three for the third. After a round has been completed (i.e. each team has been asked three questions), the category tiles are redrawn.<br/><br/>Each team also has 3 switches on the board that they can activate once per round. One is labelled with a &quot;Z&quot;, the other two are labelled with a &quot;B&quot;. The &quot;Z&quot; switch allows a team to swap one of their categories with another team. The &quot;B&quot; switch allows a team to challenge the active team. If the active team can't answer their question but the challenging team can, they earn extra points (one if they used the switch after the question was asked, and three if they used it before even knowing the question). If the challenging team answers incorrectly, they lose one point.<br/><br/>Main differences to the standard Bezzerwizzer game:<br/><br/>- smaller, travel-friendly box, board and components<br/>- 1200 questions (instead of 5000)<br/>- 12 categories (instead of 20; multiple categories from the standard game were combined into one category)<br/>- each player/team gets three questions per round (instead of 4)<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on the role of the best rock band in their universe, whose goal is to get the most points until the last battle of bands. Use unique techniques, optimize your bandwidth and invest in improvements to prove who is the biggest band in the whole multiverse. This is rock'n roll, baby!<br/><br/>LIST OF COMPONENTS<br/><br/>1 Rules Book<br/>5 Band Sheet<br/>1 Game Board<br/>4 Disc Award Tiles<br/>16 cards of Opportunities<br/>20 Cancellation tiles<br/>1 First Player token<br/>24 Custom dices<br/><br/>The game board contains the most basic actions of dice allocation. With a combination of dice faces, the player allocates their dice in the spaces available to perform the specific actions. If a space already contains dices from other players, you can not use that space.<br/>All players receive at the beginning of the match 4 dices of their color, which represents the members of their band. On your turn, you use the faces of your rolled dice, and allocate them on the board.<br/>In addition to the board, there are the Hit Cards, which work the same way, as there are spaces available to allocate dice and receive the bonuses. The difference is that a player can buy a Hit, and when another player allocates dices on his Hit, you are also benefited. For this reason, there is a deck of Hits with 18 different cards to be restored to the table as the players buy them (only 3 are revealed).<br/><br/>Each player also receives a Band Sheet from their band, and each of them has the Fan, Fame, Overdrive and Money tracks, which are marked with cubes. Throughout the match, each player, through their actions, can improve these attributes to try to improve their score at the end of the game. Each band also has special abilities that are unlocked throughout the match, optimizing their technique and improving their performance.<br/>At the table, there are 4 discs of awards, which are goals that bands can achieve to claim them, and increase their score. When you take an award disc (bronze, silver, gold or diamond), you become the owner of it, and another player can not take it from you. You still have the option of swapping it for another better scoring disc when you can meet your requirements, but you will have to return the lower scoring score, making it available to other players.<br/><br/>Finally, at the end of rounds 3, 6 and 8 (total of 8 rounds) the Battle of Bands takes place. Players use their dices to fight between them, trying to eliminate opponents' dices for 2 scrolling acts and comparing results. You can only defeat an opponent's dice if you have more equal faces than the symbol you want to remove from it. For example, you can use 2 skull faces to defeat the only skull result of one of your target foes. At the end of the battle, the remaining dice will provide bonuses to the players.<br/>In addition to the game, there is also a concern to accumulate symbols for the collection, which are printed on the Hit Cards, the Band Sheet, and Dices at the end of the last battle.

        "description": "In Zampa la Granja (&quot;Feed the Farm&quot;), players compete to become the best farmers, with this role being determined by whoever has the greatest number and variety of animals &mdash; and most importantly who feeds them well.<br/><br/>Animals are very hungry, but food is scattered on the different farms, so farmers must enforce their expertise to find the right food for each type of animal. On a turn, a player rolls the dice. The color result indicates the farm they should visit in this turn. They loudly state which animal they want to feed, then reveal one of the food tiles on the corresponding farm. If food corresponds to the animal, then they claim the corresponding animal from the center of the table and the food from the farm, then place these items on their game area. If they fail, the animal remains in the center of the table and the food flips back down.<br/>If the dice roll shows the wild card, the player can visit any farm they want.<br/><br/>When one type of animal runs out from the center of the table, a player can still take the food from a farm to feed their own animals. If one type of animals runs out and player doesn't have this species, they can steal another's player animal in order to feed it, so they take the food from the farm and the stolen animal, which is placed in their game area. A hungry wolf also prowls among the farms, and if you run into the wolf, it steals your food.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when food runs out at one farm, then the player with the most food wins. In case of tie, the winner will be whoever has the greatest variety of animals.<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>Description from the publisher (Spanish):<br/><br/>En Zampa la granja, los jugadores competiten por ser los mejores granjeros. Para ello deber&aacute;n conseguir la mayor cantidad y variedad de animales; y lo mas importante de todo... alimentarlos bien.<br/>Los animales estan hambrientos y la comida se encuentra dispersa en las distintas granjas. Los granjeros deberan hacer valer su experticia para conseguir la comida para cada tipo de animal en cada granja.<br/><br/>El jugador que consiga alimentar la mayor cantidad y variedad de animales al final de la partida ser&aacute; el ganador.<br/><br/>En su turno, el jugador tira el dado. Este indicar&aacute; la granja que deber&aacute; visitar en este turno. Entonces, en voz alta dir&aacute; a que animal va a alimentar y revela alguna de las losetas de comida de la granja correspondiente. Si acierta, se queda con el animal y la comida. Si falla el animal se queda en el centro de la mesa y la comida se vuelve a voltear.<br/><br/>Cuando se no quede alg&uacute;n tipo de animal en el centro de la mesa, el jugador podr&aacute; seguir alimentado los animales que ya tenga.<br/>En el caso de que no queden animales de una especie y el jugador no tenga dicho animal; podr&aacute; robar un animal a otro jugador con el fin de alimentarlo. Entonces se lleva a su area de juego el animal robado y la comida correspondiente.<br/><br/>Tened cuidado porque hay un lobo hambriento merodeando... si te topas con el podr&aacute; robarte tu comida.<br/><br/>La partida acaba inmediatamente cuando se acaban las comidas en una granja.<br/>El jugador con la mayor cantidad de comida es el ganador, en caso de empate, el ganador ser&aacute; quien tenga la mayor variedad de animales.<br/><br/>",

Most importantly, how would the others feel? Feelinks makes you share your emotions, flex your empathy and discover the people around you!<br/><br/>With this second edition of the game, Feelinks can now be played from 2 players, with a gameplay that has been simplified in order to better serve the core of the game. <br/>Furthermore, Feelinks is now completely cooperative and gets new artworks featuring genderfree animals. <br/>Last but not least, this second edition comes with a new deck of Situations cards, &quot;In Society&quot;. This category covers 6 sub-themes (Health, Parenthood, Living Together, Digital World, Ecology and Education) to be played with your family, your friends but also as a tool if you're woriking with children or teenagers.<br/><br/>Feelinks is a game of emotions. When playing, you:<br/><br/>1) Pick a card and chose a situation to read.<br/>2) Secretly choose the emotion that matches how you feel.<br/>3) Starting with the active player, you guess which emotion has been chosen by another player, who will in turn do the same until all emotions have been revealed.<br/><br/>The empathy track will tell how well you know your friends and family. It's more than a game: Feelinks is a journey towards a better understanding of yourself and others through funny, serious or suprising situations.<br/><br/>&quot;Feelings&quot;, the original title of the game, won the call for projects launched by the city of Poitiers in the fight against discrimination. The goal was the creation of a simple, easily playable game that relies on situations or questions around discrimination. Jean-Louis Roubira, one of the designers, previously developed the famous Dixit workshops of language with young people at risk.<br/><br/>In the game, our preconceptions are challenged. Feelinks contains 156 cards offering 468 situations from everyday life. For example: &quot;You have telepathic powers&quot; or &quot;Your sister hacked a government computer&quot;. The players are invited to think about how they would feel in a given situation and to guess the feeling of another player in the same situation.<br/><br/>This empathy for each player is conducive to the debate and to challenges of our preconceptions. Feelinks encourages you to express what you feel and to put yourself in somebody else's shoes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&ldquo;I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.&rdquo; -Albert Einstein<br/><br/>STICKS AND STONES 2ND EDITION<br/>Seven days after a limited nuclear exchange has irradiated most of Russia and the United States, Soviets roll across the West German border, eager to claim precious non-irradiated ground for the Politburo. American armor stationed at the border rushes forward to meet them, and World War IV begins, fought with much more than Einstein's sticks and stones.<br/><br/>BUT SECOND EDITION? WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? GOOD QUESTION. HERE'S WHAT'S NEW. <br/>The rules have been updated, revised, and polished. Mark's goal was to create an error-free, easily understood version of the rules. We turned our polished writ over to one of the best layout artist in the industry to make the rules look as good as they read. We hope you'll like the results.<br/>We gave the same treatment to the Player Aid Cards. Again, our goal was to give you error-free, easily understood information, presented in an attractive manner. Additionally, the Fire Results Table as been modified to more closely align with Poland Strikes, and better fit the capabilities of the units in Sticks and Stones. <br/>The attractive counters, map, and Action Cards remain the same. So bottom line, if you bought the 1st edition, all you need to do is download the rules and PACs right here. For free. <br/>HOW DO YOU PLAY?<br/><br/>Glad you asked. In Sticks and Stones each turn is gamed through several phases. At the beginning of the turn, the players determine initiative with a unique dice-off system in which ties award the initiative to whomever lacked it the previous turn and applying the Commander's Focus to the roll might tilt the odds in your favor. Next, players will draw a scenario-designated  number  Action Cards that may be used for anything from fire support (air and artillery strikes), through rally assists, to negating the opponent's just-played card. Then it is time to rally disrupted units with a simple D6 roll against a unit's morale. Action Cards, in addition to the special Aid chit, may be used to improve a unit's chances of preparing for combat.<br/><br/>Next comes the Fire Phase and players alternate firing with individual units or stacks of units against in-range and in-sight enemy units. When firing on the enemy tanks, the target's Armor Factor is subtracted from the firing unit's Armor Piercing Factor, a D6 is rolled, and the results checked on the appropriate column on the Fire Results Table, yielding a number of potential hits. The target rolls a die for each potential hit and compares it to their morale. Pass the morale check, that hit is negated. These columns and die rolls can be modified by the target's terrain, flanking fire, the Focus marker (represents the commander's presence), and most importantly Action Cards, which can grant column shifts or even allow the same unit to fire again, adding a delicious uncertainty that the chaos of war. Players continue to alternate attacks until neither wishes to attack.<br/><br/>Now it is time to move. Unlike the preceding Fire Phase, one player moves ALL his eligible units before the opposition gets to move. Certain units can move and fire or vice versa (with a penalty), unfired opposing units can opportunity fire on enemies moving within their line of sight. As in many other facets of the game, the insightful play of Action Cards during the movement phase is critical, allowing additional movement or opportunity fire conducted by units that have already fired or even the placement of a minefield.<br/><br/>Finally, we reach the Aid and Focus Phase. Platoon Commander eschews the use of HQs that can be unrealistically targeted. Instead both players have Aid and Focus markers, representing where the commander intends to place emphasis or send additional assets (ammunition, weapons, etc) or first aid. The placement of these markers provides combat and morale bonuses to the units underneath them. Additionally, if the player chooses, the Focus marker can be used to influence the initiative roll. And that's how you play Sticks and Stones.<br/><br/>EACH GAME INCLUDES:<br/>88 die-cut counters, depicting M901s, M113s, T-72s, T-80s, and M1 Abrams.<br/>1 super hot, only slightly radioactive, post-nuclear playing map.<br/>Easy rules and scenarios, so you can start playing before WWV. <br/>Three Player Aid Cards.<br/>18 Action Cards.<br/>A spiffy Ziploc bag for containment.<br/>You'll need to take two six-sided dice with you to the fallout shelter.<br/><br/>Game Design: Mark Holt Walker<br/>Players: 2<br/><br/>Duration: 60-90 minutes<br/>Complexity: Medium<br/>Solitaire Suitability: High<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Les Guerres de Bourgogne 1474-1477 (Wars of Burgundy) is a historical simulation from October 1474 to January 1477. One player plays the role of the Burgundian armies and their allies (Duchy of Savoy and Italian states), led by the famous Duke Charles the Bold, and the other player is in command of the Swiss Confederacy and its allies (Duchy of Lorraine and German states). The objectives are to take control of the Savoy and Lorraine territories, win pitched battles or major sieges, and neutralise the opponent's allies.<br/><br/>This is both a strategic &amp; tactical game with armies and garrisons evolving on the main strategic map and units fighting on a tactical map featuring a typical XVth century battleground. Units are men-at-arms, pikes, bowmen, crossbowmen, halberdiers, hangunners, and early cannons, from 2,000 men at full strength, 1,000 horsemen or 200 cannons of all calibers. The &quot;chrome&quot; of that period is added with tactical chits (charge, harassment shots, raining arrows, ditch, fence, clash of pikes, cannon battery) and events such as rain, snow, minor ally, no fight or betrayal, no wing deployment. Optional rule includes a possible intervention of the French kingdom to support one side or the other. You will be able to fight the famous battles of Hericourt (1474), Grandson &amp; Morat (1476), and Nancy (1477), the latter involving a fatal outcome for Charles the Bold.<br/><br/>The complete sequence of a turn:<br/>I/ Burgundy<br/>1) Reinforcement, replacement<br/>2) strategic move<br/>3) attrition phase<br/>4) combat phase (battles &amp; sieges)<br/>II/ Swiss Confederacy<br/>Same sequence<br/>III/ Diplomatic phase<br/>check for victory<br/><br/>The game includes 108 die-cut counters, an A3 size strategic and an A5 size tactical map.

The playing pieces represent the actual units that participated, or could have participated, in those fights. The maps represent the terrain over which those units fought or could have fought.<br/><br/>Two games are included: Kabul &rsquo;79 (K&rsquo;79), covering the Soviet seizure of the Afghan capital in that year; and Wurzburg Pentomic (WP), the Soviets versus the US in Germany in the mid-to-late 1950s. There are two players in each game. In K&rsquo;79 one player controls the Soviets and the other commands the Afghans plus optional &lsquo;what-if&rsquo; US reinforcements. In WP one player controls the Soviets, the other runs US and West German forces. Both games use a main body of shared rules, and each also has its own special instructions. Designed by Joseph Miranda.<br/><br/>Maneuver units include: infantry, elite infantry, air assault, airmobile infantry, mechanized Infantry, armor, armored cavalry, recon, special operations, security, military police, engineers, guerillas and headquarters. Ranged artillery types include: field artillery, self-propelled artillery, assault guns, rocket artillery and air defense artillery.<br/>Most units are battalions or regiments, but the entire counter-mix has units within it as large as divisions and as small as companies. Units are one-step, with their reverse sides used to show their &ldquo;untried&rdquo; status.<br/><br/>Rules cover: random events, reinforcements, bombardment, suppression, air power, air mobility, atomic weapons, paratroops, recon, screening, special forces, guerrillas, fire control and much more.<br/><br/>Cold War Battles 2: Pentomic Wurzburg &amp; Kabul '79 was published in Strategy &amp; Tactics magazine #263  Jul/Aug 2010.<br/><br/>Pentomic Wurzburg Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn : 12 hours<br/>Hex: 1 mile / 1.6 kilometers<br/>Units: Company to Brigade<br/><br/>Kabul '79 Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 day<br/>Hex: 273 yards / 250 meters<br/>Units: Company to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; six color mapsheet<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (280 1/2&quot; counters)<br/>One 16-page Cold War Battles 2 rules booklet<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-8<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tori (Bird) Shogi is a delightful variant played on a 7&times;7 board that dates from the late 18th century.  It is thought to have been the first Shogi variant to utilize drops (a mechanic in the modern version of 9&times;9 Shogi and absent from the original 9&times;9 Sho Shogi).  Each piece is named after a type of bird.  The royal piece (King) is the Phoenix.  Other pieces include the Swallow (promotes to Wild Goose), Falcon (promotes to Eagle), Crane, Pheasant, and Quail.  The goal of the game is to capture the opposing Phoenix.<br/><br/>Somewhat of an oddity is the fact that a player's two Quail pieces are actually asymmetrical, being designated as the Left Quail and the Right Quail, with their movement capabilities mirrored.  Drops are handled in a manner very similar to modern Shogi.  A third swallow cannot be dropped in a file that contains two others, nor can one be dropped on the last rank, where it would not be able to move.  In addition, a swallow cannot be dropped so as to give immediate mate.<br/><br/>The promotion zone for Swallows and the Falcon consists of the opponent's back two ranks.  Promoted pieces revert to their un-promoted value when they are captured (for purposes of dropping back into play).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a place where politics, magic and science are covered in a heavy layer of coal dust lies the world of Steam Court. Steam Court is a 1&ndash;12 player card game that mixes elements of traditional trick-taking, with character based abilities and victory point win conditions.<br/><br/>Steam Court is a game of Victorian hierarchy where the more powerful your position, the greater your opportunity in the game. You'll want to try and hold onto the throne, but don't play your cards right and you'll end up serving the lousy Tea Boy. Each round, players rotate position at the table, and depending on their seat they gain/lose privileges. Even though the game is stacked in favor of those at the top, the luck of the deal, use of special cards, and player strategy are guaranteed to make it interesting.<br/>  <br/>There are multiple variations on how to play, but the typical game involves four rounds of cards and usually takes around 60 minutes.<br/> The original artwork, intriguing theme, and clever game play will have you ratcheting for the top in Steam Court.<br/><br/>Goal: get rid of the cards in your hand before other players do. There are many strategies you can employ do this, but the most common is to be the controlling player to start the trick. The player who wins the trick starts the next trick. This allows you to decide how many cards of the same number you will play. Then all other players must match the quantity of cards played and also beat the number that is on the cards. For example, if a player lays three 1s, then the next player must lay three cards of a higher number - like three 2s or three 3s. What gives this game an extra dimension are the variable character privileges. Each Engineer is granted a different privilege by their Courtier that can be employed at the beginning of the Quarter or throughout the game. For example, the Duke can lay matching numbered cards instead of having to play higher numbered cards on a set of cards.<br/><br/>End of the Quarter: After everyone's cards have been played the Quarter ends and players re-seat based on the order they went out in (first player out becomes the Queen, and so on). They then gain the privileges of a different character for the next Quarter.<br/><br/>7-12 players: When playing with a large group a new element is added to the game -- a second table full of Renegades. Players who do poorly in the Royal Court are banished to the Renegade table, while the top two engineers at the Renegade Table are promoted to the Royal Court. In Steam Court, anything can happen. The lowest of low can climb to the top, or the Queen&rsquo;s engineer can wind up working for the vagabond.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Clusterfight is a party game of hypothetical battles for 3-12 players. If you've ever stayed up into the wee hours debating the finer points of Freddy vs. Jason, or Kirk vs. Picard, this game's for you. And seriously, who really thinks that the landmark case of Alien vs. Predator settled anything? Nobody even stopped to ask, &quot;What if Predator had laser eyes?&quot;<br/><br/>Each round in Clusterfight, players throw combatants into the ring, then change the dynamics of the fight with &quot;battle cards&quot;. Sure, Batman could beat up the Pope, but what if Batman was &quot;Vomiting Uncontrollably&quot; and the Pope was &quot;Fighting Mad&quot;? Everyone has a chance to bet on the outcome, then a judge decides the winner and bets are settled. When all players have judged twice, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The world of Disserei has grown a little too small for all its inhabitants to coexist peacefully. The tentative treaty between the five clans has all but dissolved, and tensions are rising as the chaos of war approaches. Players enter the picture as potential leaders of a new era, and attempt to build a nation that will become the center of civilization. That nation can be warlike or peaceful.<br/><br/>Unition is a deckbuilding combat free-for-all with two ways to win. Players have the choice of an aggressive approach where they reduce every other player&rsquo;s health to zero, or playing defensively and winning by points. Health and points are kept secret behind player screens, and so social dynamics play a part in overall strategy as the game goes on.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a low-value starter deck from which they draw a hand of five cards to play on their turn. These played cards give resources like currency to recruit stronger clan cards, attack to direct at other players, and points to collect. Recruited clan cards bring new abilities and stronger elements into player's decks, and each clan has a specialty. Two cards of the same clan gain bonuses when played together, with a large bonus occurring if a member from each clan is played in a single hand.<br/><br/>The game ends in one of two ways: when only one player has health left, making them the last player standing, or when one player has gained 50 points. Each player starts with 50 health tokens, and when they reach zero, they are eliminated while other players continue. However, the instant any player gains their 50th point token, the game immediately ends for everyone and that player wins.<br/><br/>Unition requires each player to carefully decide their path, balance resources, and build their empire while also playing the macro game of navigating the politics and subterfuge of those sitting around the table.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The official tabletop adaptation of the hit video game, Sea of Thieves: Voyage of Legends is a competitive 4X game for 2-4 players. From fulfilling bounties and following treasure maps, to raiding forts and boarding ships to steal their loot, players live the life of a nefarious pirate as they compete to earn the title of Pirate Legend before their rivals.<br/><br/>But, players must be wary. Gaining reputation will not be easy, and they&rsquo;ll have to contend with more than just their rivals. Ancient ships prowl the oceans, and foreboding forts blot the horizon, both crewed by hostile skeletal foes. Behemoths like the kraken and megalodon, easily capable of capsizing a ship in moments, lurk in the deep just waiting for unsuspecting craft to pass overhead.<br/><br/>Earning reputation enough to become a pirate legend can be achieved in a variety of ways, and there&rsquo;s no one way to victory. Searching out and completing contracts from one of the trading companies is a just as much a path to success as hunting enemies, and however you choose to earn your coin, spending it to upgrade your fleet with special crew and bigger ships is always a good choice.<br/><br/>Gameplay is intuitive and easy to learn, with a fresh and streamlined approach to 4X games. Player turns follow a straightforward action economy and are designed to be quick to keep the action flowing and reduce downtime around the table. At the end of each round a fortune card system provides rubber-banding for players that are lagging behind, helping to keep the game competitive until the very last moment.<br/><br/>The playing area, special crew, locations of treasure and enemies, and events that occur are randomised each game, meaning that every game will be different even before factoring in the actions and decisions made by the players at the table.<br/><br/>Players will have to be engaged at all times, thanks to these cards, which can be played at any time, and because unlike other games in this genre, they won&rsquo;t have safe or fixed bases &mdash; all players ply the same seas around the outpost in the middle of the table, and must constantly be on guard for attacks.<br/><br/>Can you win the race to become a pirate legend before your rivals? Or will you forever be a scurvy knave? Find out the answer on the Sea of Thieves!<br/><br/>",

From the rulebook...<br/><br/>&quot;Saga minigame recreates a mythical time period occuring sometime after the fall of Rome - the age of heroes and vikings!  Each player takes a heroic figure and attempts to perform deeds that will generate enough glory to ensure that the hero's memory will live in the sagas composed after his or her death.<br/><br/>To gain glory, the heros slay monsters, accumulate treasure hoards, recruit lesser heros (&quot;jarls&quot;, or earls) as their companions, and establish kingdoms.  The hero who gains the most glory is the one whose fame will live on in the sagas, while the others are doomed to be forgotten by posterity.  Each player must be decisive and alert to grasp chances and avoid having other heroes gain glory at his or her expense.&quot;<br/><br/>",

They will design its blocks and buildings, trying to adjust to the carousel of different color markers and the ever-changing dice rolls. The one whose city will be the most comfortable to live in will win.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/>The game is played over a series of rounds. Each round, two Project dice are rolled, and each player, using the marker of their current color, must do one of the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Draw a Shape &mdash; Fill 4 spaces of their map with the rolled Shape (anywhere on the map, rotated or flipped, but not modified)<br/>     Draw an Object and score VP for it &mdash; Attach an Object to a Block of the correlating color, according to either the rolled Object OR their current marker.<br/><br/><br/>When everyone is done drawing either the rolled Shape or one of the two Objects, the markers are passed around the table, and a new round begins.<br/><br/>Game End<br/>When anyone announces their 9th Object, the game is over. The player with the most VP wins.<br/><br/>Additional Modes<br/>The players can choose to play with any combination of Individual Goals, Additional Goals, and/or Bonuses that add even more tactical and strategical depth to the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They take turns brushing the teeth of these fearsome beasts, but dragons can't keep their mouths open all day. Occasionally they get tired, though, and must close their mouths. If one does and you happen to be the unlucky soul brushing that dragon's teeth, then...chomp!<br/><br/>In each turn, the players must brush the teeth of a different dragon. Different dragons have different patience levels, expressed by a number. One player checks the dragon card, makes a statement about it which can be as vague or outright false as s/he wants, and then plays a brushing card with a number. The other players play their cards face-down and reveal simultaneously then. Starting with the smallest number, then counting up, the players check who was successful, who was bitten (whose card was counted when the dragon ran out of patience) and who didn't get his/her turn at all. Successful players get their card values in points, bitten players get negative points, and the others get nothing.<br/><br/>After eight rounds, the player with the highest total wins the game.<br/><br/>",

One ingredient too many, and the cauldron will explode!<br/><br/>In Bobbidi Boom, players start with a deck of ordinary ingredients, and on their turn they can choose to either reveal the top card of their deck or pass: If you pass, you exit from the round taking low risks and thus low rewards; if you reveal a card, you stay in play...unless you revealed the third ingredient of the same kind on the table! In this case, the cauldron explodes and you are out of the round. The remaining players keep playing &mdash; revealing ingredients or passing &mdash; until all players but one are gone. At the end of the round, starting from the last man standing, each player adds a new card to their deck, with the players who made the cauldron explode taking the worst cards available.<br/><br/>Cards gained during rounds represent special Ingredients with both a point value and a special effect that will spice things up.

        "description": "Order of Arms is a simulation game of battles from Medieval &amp; Renaissance times; from Hastings in 1066, to Pavia in 1525, a period that featured the mounted armored knight before the rise of wide spread professional infantry armies. Players take the role of the Field Commander of an army of the period, attempting to fulfill victory conditions using mounted and foot arms of the period.<br/><br/>Players use arms of the period including men-at-arms, both mounted and dismounted, infantry including archers, and when available, early firearms.<br/><br/>Order of Arms is descended from and related to the 3rd edition of the grand tactical Napoleonic game Eagles of the Empire. Players familiar with that game will recognize many features of that system present here in Order of Arms. However (and this is a BIG however), there are significant differences between Eagles of the Empire and Order of Arms; most notably the scale at which Order of Arms portrays its combat, and the resulting procedures that emphasize unit to unit fighting. Moreover, where the queen of the battlefield in Napoleon's time was the linear Infantry formation, in Order of Arms, the dominant unit up until near the very end of the period covered, was the Mounted Men-at-Arms (MMA); the armored knight; the result of which is that the long playing piece in Order of Arms is the MMA unit.<br/><br/>Fornovo 1495, the first game in the series presents the battle fought between the French Army of King Charles VIII, and the Condottieri forces of the League of Venice under the command of Francesco II Gonzaga of Mantua. The game features the Historical Battle as fought by Francesco Gonzaga across a rising Taro River, a free-set up version, and a what-if scenario that portrays the Italian fear of a French drive on Parma.<br/><br/>Complexity: 5 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10<br/><br/>Time Scale: 20 minutes per turn<br/>Map Scale: 350 yards per area<br/>Unit Scale: Battalions and Companies<br/><br/>Players: 1 to 2<br/>Playing Time: 2 to 4 hours<br/><br/>Components:<br/>1 Series rulebook<br/>1 Game specific rulebook/scenario book<br/>1 Map 22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo;<br/>2 Countersheets with both long and square counters<br/>Multiple charts and tables cards<br/>3 Six-sided Dice<br/>1 Box and Lid<br/><br/>(source: Compass Games website and user's description)<br/><br/>",

Every player contributes one animal card and one quality card to each other player's totem.<br/><br/>Players can earn more points if the cards that they played were considered to be especially relevant and accurate, either by the active player or by the other players. The favourite animal and quality cards for that round stay in front of the active player and become their totem. The game ends when everyone has a totem.<br/><br/>The player with the most points at the end of the game wins, but everyone else gains something as well: a greater awareness of how others perceive and appreciate them!<br/><br/>",

Mount Tai is of key importance in Chinese religion, being the eastern one of the five Sacred Mountains of China. According to historical records, Mount Tai became a sacred place visited by emperors to offer sacrifices and meditate in the Zhou Dynasty before 1,000 BC. A total of 72 emperors were recorded as visiting it. Writers also came to acquire inspiration, to compose poems, write essays, paint and take pictures. Hence, a great many cultural relics were left on the mountain. During the reign of Liu Che, Emperor Wu of Han, the Emperor has visited Mount Tai 8 times, praising the deities associated to this mountain. In 90 BC, the elderly aged Emperor spent most of the national strength on military operations, and his crown prince died because of his paranoia, leaving the court and the royal family in a mess. Liu Guang, the King Lu&rsquo;an and nephew of the Emperor, was incurably sick. He decided to allocate the administration of Mount Tai to his sons, hoping to train their abilities of governing. In this game, the player shall play as one of the princes of the King to govern part of Mount Tai, working to win the praise from the Emperor. After the duration of two years, the prince with the most prosperous feud shall win the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>泰山，自古以來被視為最靠近天的山，橫貫山東中部。<br/><br/>天以高為尊，地以厚為德。故增泰山之高以報天，禪梁父之址以報地。在傳統信仰中，天空代表神的所在位置，所以人們總以為：越靠近天空代表著越接近神。由於泰山地勢高聳且距離都城不遠，中國古代多為皇帝曾經前往泰山之頂祭天，而其更富有著&ldquo;登泰山而小天下&rdquo;的盛名。漢武帝曾經八次登頂泰山，更是留下了&ldquo;泰山八贊&rdquo;的驚歎。<br/><br/>征和三年（西元前90年），漢武帝晚年窮兵黷武，太子又因巫蠱之禍而亡，朝廷內外一片混亂。當時世道不穩，漢武帝侄子魯安王劉光深感自己久病難醫。為穩固大漢江山，將泰山分給子孫治理，以期將子孫培養成國之棟樑。<br/><br/>玩家在遊戲中將扮演當時魯安王劉光子孫中的一位，各自治理泰山一隅，為使封地達到&ldquo;泰山八贊&rdquo;的&ldquo;高度&rdquo;而努力。兩年之後，看誰將自己的封地治理的最好，最受人民愛戴，誰就將獲得勝利。<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (Chinese)<br/><br/>",

More importantly, you want to make sure that no one votes for either of your two words!<br/><br/>To set up a round, lay out as many word cards as twice the number of players plus one, so eleven cards in a five-player game. Each word is assigned a number (e.g., 1-11), then each player secretly receives two number cards at random, with the final lone number being placed face down on the table. If you receive, say, 3 and 8, then you need to think of a one-word clue that links word #3 and word #8. Write your clue on your board.<br/><br/>Everyone reveals their words at the same time, then everyone tries to figure out which pair of words corresponds to each clue, with the long-term goal of figuring out which of the words was not assigned to any player. Once everyone has written their answer, reveal each player's pair of words as well as the lone number. If you guessed the answer correctly, score 20 points. For each player who guessed one of your words, lose 10 points.<br/><br/>After five rounds, whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

In a turn, players either place a tile, place their pawn on the board, or move their pawn if it's already on the board.<br/><br/>Moving a pawn is allowed under the condition that for each step (based on the square grid of the board), the pawn has to either go up or down one level. Precisely one level. Too steep a climb or descent and the pawn can't go there. Movement on the same level is also not allowed.<br/><br/>The players that reaches the highest point is the winner. In case of a tie, the player that is on the largest plateau wins. If this doesn't solve the tie, then the player that has been on the highest point the longest is the winner.<br/><br/>With two players, the game is very strategic. With 3 or 4 players luck also becomes a factor to take into account.<br/><br/>EDIT (November, 2nd 2011): There's a new supplementary rule (approved of by Winning Moves):<br/>Players are allowed to remove their own pawn from the board as a separate move (and re-enter it on the ground level at some later point of the game as a separate move).<br/><br/>",

During the story, other players can throw an &quot;interrupt&quot; die and read the result aloud. The active player has to adapt her story to the interruption: &quot;No, that's a lie!&quot;<br/><br/>Once all dice have been used up, the player throws a six sided die that gives her her score.

Grant's Union Army of the Potomac, from May 3 through July 1, 1864.<br/><br/>There are two historical scenarios that may be utilized. The initial stage of the actual campaign is portrayed in the May scenario, from the battle at the Wilderness to the battle at Cold Harbor. The June scenario portrays the campaign from Cold Harbor to the siege of Petersburg. Several optional scenarios permit the &quot;what if?&quot; possibilities of the campaign to be simulated.<br/><br/>(from the Designer's Notes:)<br/><br/>In a real sense neither side won the campaign since so little of either side's objectives was accomplished. But, strategically, Grant really won by allowing all the other Union commanders to successfully advance. He did it by pinning the Army of Northern Virginia every step back to Richmond and bleeding the South so dry that no assistance was possible. The cost was high (and many think higher than necessary), but it worked.<br/><br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/><br/>    22&quot; x 28&quot; mapsheet<br/>    255 counters<br/>    1 rules folder (10 pages)<br/>    1 terrain effects chart<br/>    2 combat result/scenario sheets<br/>    1 6-sided die<br/><br/><br/>(originally published in the white box/tray format)<br/><br/><br/>Uses a system similar to SPI's Lee Moves North: The Confederate Summer Offensive, 1862 & 1863.<br/><br/>",

It was renamed Joffre, after the victorious French general, in the 1920s. It is a re-emplementation of Lost Heir and was re-emplemented in Saskatchewan as Kaiser.<br/><br/>It is played with 2 teams of 2. Players bid on the number of tricks they think they will win. High card taking the trick, and each trick being worth 1 point.<br/><br/>Each suit represents a different army from WWI (ex: instead of an Ace of Hearts you have a 7 General of Russia)<br/><br/>There are 4 special cards in the deck. If you win a trick with the &quot;Joffre&quot; (French commander in WWI) then he is worth an additional 5 points and taking the German &quot;Kaiser&quot; will cause you to lose 3 points.

One player rolls the two dice &ndash; one showing colors, the other symbols &ndash; then everyone simultaneously tries to grab any discs showing the colored symbol determined by the die roll. If a die shows a white face instead of a color or symbol, then that characteristic is ignored for the round. For example, if the roll is white (i.e., blank) and red, then players can grab any disc with a red symbol. If both dice show white, then it's a free-for-all, with players grabbing as many discs as possible!<br/><br/>A player can use only one hand to grab discs. If a player accidentally grabs the wrong disc, she must return that disc to the playing area, along with an additional disc as a penalty.<br/><br/>When all the discs have been claimed, the game ends and the player with the most discs wins!<br/><br/>",

In order to do so, they have to pick the most suitable penguins to build their structure while eyeing the goals set by the pharaohs. They must balance the priority of choosing the best penguins with the strategic impact of the actions they can perform. You don't need dexterity or brute force: the smartest architect will prevail!<br/><br/>",

The first consonant may not be used by the players in their word but the other consonants may be used and are assigned values of one, two or three. The topic is read aloud and the players must think up a word that fits the topic and uses any or all of the permissible consonants but not the forbidden consonant. The first to think up a word announces it and totals its value. The other players then secretly decide whether anyone else can come up with a higher scoring word. Once the players have voted anyone who thinks a higher scoring can been generated has an additional twenty seconds (a sand timer is included) to announce that word. Points are scored based on who came up with the round's winning word and who voted correctly.<br/><br/>The final round of the game has the players deciding which of two teams to join secretly. The player who comes up with the highest scoring word on each team scores the most points.<br/><br/>The player with the most points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

When you hatch, you notice that your egg was different than the other eggs. But this is your nest, right? So, you want to throw them out. Looking around, you notice another cuckoo. Your competitor! Will you manage to get rid of all other eggs or lure your competitor into a trap? Start the battle.<br/><br/>You take alternating turns, with the starting player going first. Your turn consists of moving one game piece on the board, your turn ends after the movement. There are three different game pieces, each with their own rules for movement.<br/><br/>Game pieces can only move to a space on the board that is empty or occupied by an opponent. Game pieces cannot jump over other game pieces. When you move a game piece to an occupied space, you capture your opponent on this space. Your opponents&rsquo; game piece is then removed from the board and your game piece takes its place. There are two basic rules to keep in mind; 1) if you can capture an opponent, you are obliged to. 2) You can only move your game pieces in a forward direction, except when you can capture an opponent behind you.<br/><br/>Your movement options lead to two potential situations; 1) you can capture an opponent, or 2) you cannot capture an opponent.<br/><br/>There are four winning conditions in this battle. 1) All game pieces of your own color are captured, except your own cuckoo. 2) You capture your opponents&rsquo; cuckoo. 3) You enter one of the homebases of your opponent with your own cuckoo, thereby taking over their nest. 4) Your opponent enters one of your homebases with any game piece other than their cuckoo, this game piece is now safe from being captured.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Plunder is a deduction card game in which everyone is a pirate captain with a buried treasure. Players attempt to steal the hidden treasures of the other captains by figuring out the three landmarks that mark where each treasure is hidden. The first player to a treasure takes the largest share, while those who reach it second or third receive less. Keeping your treasure from being stolen is also worth victory points in the end. Find and steal the most treasures first to win in the end!<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Players each get a random set of 3 cards (3 colors) each numbered 1-6: a unique combination. There are 3 decks of question cards matching these colors. On your turn, flip the top 3 questions; you may replace one of these by flipping the next card in that deck. All other players then respond AYE or NAY if they do or do not (respectively) have any exact matches. At any time players may guess the combo of any player by putting their guess into the treasure chest box. Each player in an n-player game may make n unique guesses.<br/><br/>After 15 rounds, guesses are revealed in the order they were submitted. If correct, that player will steal from that pirate's treasure: first 3, then 2, then 1. If no one steals your treasure, it's worth 6 to you; if they do, you lose the points they're taking. The player with the most treasure (their own, plus any stolen from others) wins!<br/><br/>",

Morpheus must make sure that dreams leave Oniria to the world and minds of mortals at the same rate as to this moment, otherwise Earth is doomed to regress of thinking and Oniria &ndash; to annihilation. Mortals need dreams to think, remember and stimulate their imagination, Oniria needs sleeping humans to exist &ndash; without dreamers Oniria will be left without power. But Morpheus cannot rule Kingdom of Dreams and create dreams and send them alone. That is why he needs an assistant.  He makes a competition &ndash; Dreamweavers have three months (this is rather foggy, time in Oniria works &ndash; like most things &ndash; differently than in mortal world) to weave the most dreams with the most powerful oniric energies &ndash; the best weaver will become Morpheus&rsquo; right hand, and simultaneously second most powerful creature in Oniria.<br/><br/>Morpheus is a game for 2-4 players in which players will create dreams. At the beginning of each turn, the active player rolls the dice. Then, players will choose the dice and according to the number they will get different gifts, with essence among them. After that, at certain locations Dreamweavers can assign the essence to dreams and completing them. Other gifts include Chronite, a rare mineral able to bend time, used as a currency and Onirite, a device which can bend the structure of Oniria, allowing players to take additional actions. Dreamweavers will travel through the land of Oniria exactly three months of game-time, which equals 21 turns. The board is randomly assembled from tiles and dreamweavers will go a full circle from location to location. Player who creates the most powerful dreams and collects the most victory points wins the game and becomes right hand and assistant of Morpheus.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pig Pile is an extremely light card (and punny) game. The cards have illustrations of pigs (naturally), and you can be &quot;hog tied&quot; or have a &quot;hog wash&quot;.<br/><br/>Players start with three face-down cards (called &quot;Slop&quot;) and a hand of six cards. At the start you place three of your cards face-up on top of the slop cards, leaving you with a hand of three cards. Each turn you must play to the central &quot;Pig Pile&quot; one or more cards of the same value that are equal to or greater than the top card of the Pig Pile. If you fail to do so, you must take the entire Pig Pile into your hand. Certain cards have special effects:<br/><br/><br/>    Hog Wild: Wild card that can be played at any time and allows any card to played on it next turn.<br/>    Hog Tied (4s): The next player loses his turn.<br/>    Hog Wash (8s): Remove the Pig Pile from the game and take another turn. (If three cards of the same value are played in succession, a Hog Wash takes place automatically.)<br/>    Ewe Turn (11s): Reverse order of play.<br/><br/><br/>Each turn you draw back to three cards until the deck runs out. If you have no cards in hand (which can happen only after the deck runs out), you must play a face-up card (a card that you laid aside at start) or if those are gone, a slop card. (Slop cards are played blind, so you could be really screwed.) If you're the first or second player to rid yourself of cards (including your slop), you receive a number of pigs. Whoever has the most pigs after five hands wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cysmic is an epic sci-fi strategy wargame set amidst a crumbling planet. Players assume the role of one of the factions on the planet that is fighting desperately to survive. Throughout the game, players gather resources, capture enemy units, and work to construct their colony ship. Once built, the colony ship must be launched once all of your units are evacuated. The faction to do so first not only escapes with their lives but also ends up destroying the planet with the force of their ship's ignition. There are no points in Cysmic. The winner is the player who completes the objective first.<br/><br/>THE STORY:<br/>&quot;The Space Exploration Expedition Network (SEEk) selected several leaders in various fields to lead an odyssey to Kepler-62e for terraforming and civilization planning. Some of the members were chosen and funded by the World Council while others self-financed their way to have influence or presence in the new world. Industry experts, religious leaders, entertainers, scholars, businessmen, politicians, and entrepreneurs all took part in the mission. Once there, the project worked beautifully at first. The different groups of people lived and worked together as a familiar society with all of the benefits and growing pains one would expect from a newly formed civilization. It had its share of infighting and corruption, but even those issues never threatened the delicate balance of this new world. It was slowly becoming the utopia many had hoped it would.<br/><br/>As the project moved forward, an unexpected instability in the terraforming process started wreaking havoc on the landscape. The news broke quickly that their efforts to terraform and create a better world had destabilized the planet. Their new Eden was doomed.<br/><br/>When the colonists realized there was no hope in saving their dream of a new civilization, chaos broke out among the hundreds of thousands of people as they turned to their respective leaders for salvation. Those in leadership roles... either voted in by public opinion, volunteered at will, ascended through capitalism, or ordained by faith... now rise to the occasion as wartime leaders.<br/><br/>Massive Terraformers that once bent the landscape to their will have now been taken over by powerful organizations and converted into colony ship construction and launch platforms. These rival factions compete for information and resources across the dying planet as their last hope to escape offworld in the original Colony Ship plans that brought them there to begin with.<br/><br/>After society splintered, the information splintered with it. Each faction holds part of the module plans to build the colony ship but must retrieve the others to finish their build. Instead of working together, they now battle for resources and information. Workers and civilians are hastily trained in combat to protect the individual faction bases from each other while still performing their regular job duties. Soldiers are tasked with capturing enemies with the knowledge of providing blueprints for the construction of the colony ship modules.<br/><br/>Once the leaders obtain the blueprints and construct their colony ship, they must launch it before the impending destruction of their homeworld. The immense energy exerted from a single colony ship launch will likely doom the rest. Which faction will gain the resources necessary to escape first?<br/>If this new world war doesn&rsquo;t destroy this utopia, the planet surely would.&quot;<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY SUMMARY:<br/>Gameplay consists of managing your empire until you can safely evacuate your people offworld. Players must recruit units, explore their surroundings, wage war against enemies, manage their economy, and obtain the resources necessary to construct their Colony Ship. The game is played in rounds made up of 5 turns per round. Each turn, players play one Unit card or Tactic card and then perform a bonus action. Each round ends when all players complete 5 turns. The next round starts with whomever currently holds the first player token.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE FOR WINNING THE GAME:<br/>Be the first player to build their colony ship and launch off the planet. Be careful evacuating your units before launching or else your conscience may not allow you to leave.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bloodiest Day: The Battle of Antietam, from Spearhead Games captures the essence of this crucial engagement. Bloodiest Day's unique approach to simulating Civil War battles uses alternating-impulses and an area map to capture the ebb and flow of Civil War battle as attack and counterattack build to a crescendo of combat.<br/><br/>17 September 1862, Sharpsburg, MD: The bloodiest single day of combat the North American continent would ever witness draws to a close. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, outmanned but not outfought by McClellan's Army of the Potomac, barely adverts disaster along the banks of the Antietam Creek. Heavy but uncoordinated Federal attacks had stretched the gray-clad lines to the breaking point. Only the nick-of-time arrival of Hill's Light Division blunts the final Union assault. McClellan refuses to commit his reserves to grasp the war-ending victory that lies within his reach. Lee's first invasion of the North ends - but the war drags on. Yet McClellan's imperfect victory would lead to Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and change fundamentally the nature of the conflict.<br/><br/>System is loosely based on the area movement games from Avalon Hill (Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino, Turning Point: Stalingrad and Breakout: Normandy) and sister game to They Met At Gettysburg.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 hours<br/>Area: 1&quot; / 2.54cm = 285 yards / 260 meters<br/>Units: Brigades<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (176 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 30-page Bloodiest Day rulebook<br/>Two single-side printed Player Aid Cards<br/>Two single-side printed Order of Battle charts<br/>Four 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Low-Medium<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 1.5 - 2.5 hours<br/><br/>",

In order to do it, mages will have to condense their energy (3 orbs) in precious gems. The first in getting 3 gems wins the beer.<br/><br/>Players have 1 action point per turn, it can be used to get 1 orb, draw a card or use 1 of the 3 types of cards: Instant, Action or Object. Cards allow players to destroy other players gems, protect their own, summon orbs magically, negate other players action or even copy one, etc.<br/><br/>Three mages and one beer, who is going to get it?<br/><br/>",

They can also elicit help from sympathetic (read gullible) human proxies.<br/><br/>The humans rely on conventional infantry, cavalry, and artillery, and perhaps a hero, for their main defense. Fortunately, the human player may get assistance from a mad scientist who can field an Infernal Machine that the Martians won't find amusing.<br/><br/>The Martians have a choice of five different victory conditions. Part of the challenge for the human player is to determine the Martian overlord's true objectives so they can be best thwarted.<br/><br/>",

As a player, you begin the game as one of four Jarls (Jarl (Earl) &ldquo;free person of noble family and high birth&rdquo;), with the goal of becoming the next Ruler of Kaupang, ensuring power and prestige for you and your descendants. You accomplish this by pillaging, trading, establishing settlements, fighting, and outmaneuvering the other Jarls. Through strategic card play and dice rolls, the Jarls battle each other across the game board. You must make strategic decisions and carefully manage your resources in order to have the best chance to win. If you play well and receive some favor from the gods, perhaps you will become the next Vikingjarl!<br/><br/>The game is turn-based and the Jarls each take turns moving their Ship and Army around the game board using Pawns, Dice, and Playing Cards. To obtain the Victory Points (VP) needed to win the game, you have to pillage, trade, settle and fight against the other Jarls. The main goal of the game is to reach a certain number of VP. The game is designed for 2-4 players, and is suitable for everybody form age 12 and up. <br/>An average round will take about 60 minutes. Includes over 260 playing pieces and cards.<br/><br/>Storyline: It is the age of Conquering, Pillage, and Trade. Ragnar Ironhand, the King of Kaupang grows old and is looking for his most suitable successor. Ragnar gathers his four children and challenges them to leave Kaupang in search of fame and fortune in foreign lands. Whoever returns home as the most prosperous sibling, will lay claim to the throne. Gather your Viking warriors and set sail, but beware the whims of the fickle Norse gods as well as of your backstabbing and ambitious siblings, who are all vying to claim the throne for themselves.<br/><br/>",

Game marker placement is shown on the game board. Command orders and cards are used to shorten the rules. Developed for solitaire play, this game requires you to make great decisions based on good strategy, keeping your wits about you when orders do not turn out well, and pressing on to victory.<br/><br/>Game play is centered around using Field Commands to issue orders by the Turks or Knights of Maltese commanders to defeat each other. Either side can be defeated by their morale falling too low. The game allows you to play either side against a solitaire opponent that has 3 levels of difficulty.<br/><br/>Pick the side you want to be, Turks or Knights of Maltese, and then shuffle the solitaire card deck for your opponent. The card mix used by the solitaire opponent differs from game to game so no two games play alike.<br/><br/>Each commander (solitaire or player) can issue one order per game turn from their Commands available.  Your order is carried out based on your strategy and current situation faced.  Your choice can cause multiple actions and reactions with results that cause troop eliminations, morale reductions, and events to occur.<br/><br/>HOW TO WIN THE GAME<br/><br/>Any time one side's morale reaches zero during a turn, the other side wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

You'll need to manage your hand of land cards carefully in order to keep moving and not let another dwarf take the gold you were eyeing.<br/><br/>Zwerg Riese includes variant rules for more experienced dwarves, one that puts a storm cloud in play on the board.<br/><br/>Awards:<br/>Zwerg Riese / Rik le g&eacute;ant has won the As d&rsquo;Or - Jeu de l&rsquo;Ann&eacute;e Enfant 2012<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The zombie plague has struck the local college campus. Only a handful of brave cheerleaders are still fighting the endless wave of old comrades and professors turned into hungry, brainless creatures.<br/><br/>Zombies vs Cheerleaders  is an asymmetrical two-player game in which one player controls the cheerleaders while the other player controls the zombies. The goal of the cheerleaders is to defeat all the zombies, while the goal of the zombies is to devour one of the cheerleaders.<br/><br/>The cheerleader are standing behind barricades and have powerful hand-made weapons and can attack with a certain strength. However, each time they attack, they lose energy. Once they run out of energy, they are knocked-out. Zombies have two characteristics: strength and protection. When they are hit by an attack greater than their protection they are removed from the game.<br/><br/>On their turn, the players have three actions they can spend to move their team or to attack. By killing bosses, cheerleaders can obtain special actions, while zombies can do the same by destroying the barricades.<br/><br/>The game uses illustrations made specially for the game by the design team of the comic book series &quot;Zombies vs Cheerleaders&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "[From the Compass Games webpage]<br/><br/>Victory at Sea, Original 1992 Edition is a strategic level game developed from Jedko&rsquo;s popular naval game, War at Sea. This two-player game refights the Battle of the Atlantic in every detail. This is a game of Grand Strategy with each player assuming the role of an Admiral of the Fleet and trying to control the sea areas that are important to his nation&rsquo;s interests. The rules are easy to learn, and yet require cunning strategies to achieve ultimate victory. An ideal wargame for beginner&rsquo;s, Victory at Sea also serves as a fast-playing, tense contest for experience gamers.<br/><br/>The Allied player, although possessing a mighty armada of English and American ships, faces a difficult task. The Kreigsmarine&rsquo;s powerful battleships Bismarck and Tirpitz present a formidable threat. Control of the Mediterranean must be wrested from an elusive Italian fleet. Vital convoys have to be protected from stalking U-Boats and audacious German surface raiders. Oilers in the Atlantic allow ships such as the Graf Spee to elude pursuit whilst harassing Allied vessels. The Axis player has a small fleet by comparison to the Allies, but a shrewd strategy can exhaust hsi opponent and win the war.<br/><br/>Victory at Sea allows you to recreate every major aspect of the naval war. The game mechanics include Admirals, port repair facilities, the invasion of France, U-Boat technology, surface raiders &amp; oilers, the British Home Fleet, critical hits &amp; damage control, limited intelligence, airpower, mines, and convoys. Components include a colorful mounted mapboard and 117 large counters representing all major German, Italian, British, American and Russian capital ships of the European theater.<br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>Complexity: Low<br/>Time Scale: abstract (9 turns)<br/>Map Scale: area movement<br/>Unit Scale: individual capital ships<br/>Players: 1-2 players<br/>Solitaire: High<br/>Playing Time: 3 hours or less<br/>Components:<br/><br/>1 Mounted map (22&Prime; x 34&Prime;)<br/>1 Countersheet<br/>1 Rulebook<br/>2 Player aid cards<br/>Dice<br/>Box and Lid<br/>Game Credits:<br/><br/>Designer: John Edwards<br/>Project Lead: Bob Cloyd<br/>Project Director: John Kranz<br/>Artist: Bruce Yearian<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wicketz is a Cricket sim using a quarter-board for the wicket, model batsmen, fielders, bowlers and umpires, a spinner for the deliveries and 246 cards for the strokes. The fielding player sets the field, the board showing concentric circles around the wicket divided into segments, selects Pace or Spin for the over and spins the delivery, eg. Good Length, Long Hop, Bouncer/Googly. Upon seeing the field and the delivery, the batting player declares a stroke, eg Cut, Cover Drive, Pull, Hook, Leg Glance. There are 12 strokes and an avoiding action if a bouncer is bowled. A card is drawn and the result determined. Initially, the delivery may defeat the batsman, so if a Cut was played, the card might read Bowled if Yorker, whereas a Straight Drive gets an LBW if Good Length. If the bowler wasn't out, the next column shows the segment the ball was struck to. If there is no fielder there, the runs are scored from the card, 0 to 4 with a very rare 6. But if there is a fielder present no runs are scored, and if the card is also marked catch, a catch is possible. This is determined by another spinner, but the higher order get 3 and 2 lives, the tail are out first time. Normal cricket rules apply and the game has advanced rules for bowling &amp; fielding variants.<br/>Sumo has the original publisher as A W Compton producing a limited 200 edition. The set I have is by RDA Marketing and Luding reckons the designer is Richard Pullen. Although my rules set refers to a card dispenser and a window display, the game doesn't have them. I can't figure out the relevance of selecting Pace or Spin whatsoever, so I suspect the earlier edition had more to it. Solid sim of limited appeal (geddit!).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hungarian Tarokk, also known as H&uacute;szash&iacute;v&aacute;sos tarokk (XX-calling tarokk), or Paskievics tarokk, is a four player, variable partnership, trick taking tarot game. As with most games in this genre, the base objective of each round is to capture a certain amount of card points (in this case, more than half) in tricks. However, each round of Hungarian Tarokk starts with a peculiar round of auctions and announcements that impart a lot of information about the players' hands, which make it a very skillful, challenging, yet surprisingly accessible game.<br/><br/>It uses a shortened pack of 42 cards: the trump suit consists of 22 cards while the other four suits consist of only five cards each. The size of each player&rsquo;s hand is only nine cards (with a talon of six cards).<br/><br/>Each round starts with a short auction in which players bid for the right to choose a partner that holds a particular high ranking trump card, usually the XX. The bid itself determines the number of cards the winner of the auction may exchange (higher bids mean less cards exchanged) and the base value of  game (to capture more than half of the card points in tricks) in points.<br/><br/>Players have restrictions on how they may bid; in particular, a player may only bid only if he or she holds an honour (the lowest trump, the second-highest trump, or the highest trump). In addition, there are bidding conventions that, unlike Bridge, are part of the rules. These conventions, or &quot;invitation bids,&quot; indicate if a player holds a particular high ranking trump.<br/><br/>After players exchange cards with the talon, there is a round of announcements. Partnerships can pursue additional objectives other than game:<br/><br/>- Winning three-fourths of the card points<br/>- Winning all the tricks<br/>- Winning all three honours<br/>- Winning all four kings<br/>- Winning the last trick with the lowest trump<br/>- XXI-catch: Capturing the opponent's second highest trump with the highest trump<br/><br/>During the round of announcements, a partnership may announce that they will accomplish one or more of these objectives, which doubles their value. A partnership may also challenge or kontra an announcement, which also doubles its value. These objectives are scored independently; a team can fail at accomplishing game but still accomplish (and score for) other objectives. Often, the value of these objectives is greater than game. For example, the base value of game ranges from 1 to 4 points, while the value of XXI-catch is 21 points.<br/><br/>",

Brent Ward<br/>Developer: Barry Kendall<br/><br/>Red Menace is a solitaire wargame pitting the strategic nuclear and defensive forces of the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom against those of the Soviet Union and its client state, Cuba, in 1959. The game focuses primarily on the role of strategic bombers, but other types of supporting aircraft such as Interceptors, Airborne Early Warning aircraft, and Aerial Refueling Tankers are also represented.<br/><br/>The term &quot;Red Menace&quot; was used during the Cold War by the U.S. because it was believed that thousands of Soviet bombers could be unleashed at a moment's notice. This turned out not to be true as the Soviets had several hundred bombers at best, and many had significant range limitations. The game is not meant to be an accurate simulation of the actual capabilities of the strategic forces involved, but rather reflects what the governments and citizens of the U.S., Canada, and the UK believed could happen.<br/><br/>Each turn consists of fifteen phases played in order from drawing random events, deploying and moving Soviet flights, intercepting flights, submarine operations and more. Reference sheets are included to make tracking the game progress easier. Decisions for the Soviet units are made by the game system using random events and dice. The player simply moves the Soviet bombers towards their assigned targets. Scenarios are included with various starting positions, targets, and actions for Soviet, United States, and United Kingdom bombers.<br/><br/>The game complexity is easy, but optional rules are included to make it more challenging. The winner of a scenario is determined by the points scored from attacking the opponent's cities. Points are awarded by a random chit draw after each successful attack. A typical scenario requires fifty points to win.<br/><br/>",

Players utilize workers to gather resources, build amenities, add activities, recruit donors, obtain donor gifts, hire more workers, staff usable cards, and earn money/victory points.<br/><br/>Usable amenities and activities are the driving forces for generating money and victory points. Some, however, are not usable every month of the year. Players must create a strategy for sustainable growth over the course of the entire year. Workers must be paid for their efforts each month. Additionally, negative cards, called Misfortunes, must be drawn as your camp grows which may affect your plan for the next round.<br/><br/>End game bonuses provide additional victory points based on what you have accumulated throughout the game. Bivouac also comes with an expansion that includes activity upgrades and staff member cards that assist in a player's quest to become the best. The player with the most victory points at the end of 13 rounds is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

When they turn a card there is a risk of being thrown out of the bar if all the lines on the cards are broken. As long as there is one line that starts on the first card and ends on the last card without any interruptions in between they can stay in the bar to continue stealing.<br/><br/>You can also turn a card that shows a guard. As soon as two guards are turned the exits of the bar are blocked. In this way it is impossible to leave the bar.

        "description": "BCT (Brigade Combat Team): Kandahar is an operational level wargame of operations in Afghanistan during the War on Terror. One player takes the role of a Coalition Force commander, the other the role of an Insurgent Force commander. Each player must accomplish objectives within a particular region, using a range of regular and irregular forces.<br/><br/>Player decisions reflect actual Task Force Group level command via a Military Staff System. Each turn, players allocate operational capabilities, represented by Joint Operations Cards. How well a player conducts his joint operations often determines the outcome of battles. But combat is not simply attrition of enemy forces. It also includes the effects of both military and political operations, as well as intelligence play. Consequently, players must think along several fronts of modern conflict.<br/><br/>A critical note: BCT Command: Kandahar uses many procedures similar to those currently utilized by U.S. and other Coalition forces. However, a number of abstractions were made to provide a playable game in a reasonable format.<br/><br/>Objective Cards are a quantification of political determination as well as the goals for which players are fighting. A player can use Objective Cards to guide their game strategy as well as to gain certain advantages. Much of the game is in determining the enemy Objective, and then taking appropriate counteraction. Often, your Objectives will conflict with your military operations, and it is up to you, the player, to determine the advantages or disadvantages of certain courses of action.<br/><br/>",

The players must visit the slave traders and traveling merchants to create his own city, while plotting to overrun his neighbor's.<br/><br/>There are four merchants to choose from, each one with diverse goods of his specialty:<br/><br/>1) Civilians<br/>2) Soldiers<br/>3) Weapons<br/>4) Items<br/><br/>Each player has a playing area of 2 rows of 5 cards. The castle is located behind the last row, in the center. Players can deploy up to 10 units into these spaces. Each turn, a player goes through the following phases:<br/><br/>1. Act <br/>2. Deploy <br/>3. Attack <br/>4. Pay <br/>5. Buy <br/>6. Discard and Draw<br/><br/>In these phases, a player<br/>1) can choose one action allowance and can execute any one card with an action on it, <br/>2) can choose to deploy a unit onto his board to improve defense and/or economy, <br/>3) can choose to attack another player to cripple their board or even to win the game by destroying their castle, <br/>4) must pay the upkeep cost of all cards currently on his board, <br/>5) can use the remaining income for the turn to visit a traveling merchant and buy more advanced units, items or weapons, and finally <br/>6) must discard his entire hand and draw a new one.<br/><br/>The combat stage of the game occurs when a player attacks, and the two players at war will have 5 fronts lined up, with a dice driven mechanic to determine which units will attack. While wars are often unpredictable, a poorly equipped militia would never stand up to an elite force! The constant threat of attack means every player must balance their military needs with their economic ones, fielding an army that's large enough to fend off attackers, yet small enough to avoid draining the economy.<br/><br/>",

The game is an update of SPI&rsquo;s East Is Red game, specifically showing the developments in warfare that have occurred in the intervening decades, and projected out to the near future. Both side&rsquo;s armed forces are smaller than they were during the Cold War, but have access to modern high-tech weapons and tactics, termed in the game as Hyperwar.<br/><br/>Dragon vs Bear: China vs Russia in the 21st Century is operational level with two players: One for China and one for Russia. It puts players in the position of having to utilize the full spectrum of military operations, which also include weapons of mass destruction. The game is played in scenarios, each postulating different reasons for the war, as well as different levels of mobilization. You win by defeating the enemy and gaining national objectives.<br/><br/>The game emphasizes land and airpower. Naval warfare is factored out on the premise that the Chinese and Russian navies would cancel each other out for the period that the game scenarios covered.<br/><br/>Conventional land and airpower are treated in a generally similar manner. This is in part because of the lack of sophisticated higher level airpower doctrines in the Chinese and Russian armed forces, but also because of the range and lethality of modern munitions: firepower is going to be the same whether delivered by a multiple rocket launcher system, an attack helicopter, or a jet bomber. The real difference will come in with the application of Hyperwar capabilities. Hyperwar is inherent in certain unit types, and can be assigned to others via Hyperwar strikes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium, Released Compass Games April 2021. Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium encompasses the Napoleonic years 1798-1815, and is designed for two to eight players, the game pitches eight Empire Nations of the Napoleonic Wars, divided into two Alliances in a fight to the death struggle for control of Napoleonic Europe.<br/><br/>The objective of Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium is for one Alliance to conquer the other by either achieving a Capital Victory (capturing key enemy territories) or a Battle Points Victory (based on favorable outcomes and achievements made during game play).<br/><br/>Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium is a team-based game! The key to winning Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium is your ability to strategize and work as a team with your allies. Each player rules an Empire with difference strengths and weakness, with different economic starting points and geographic positions. No two Empires are alike! Everyone brings something different to the table and in Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium survival relies on strong partnerships to capitalise your advantages!<br/><br/>But although no two Empires are alike, the two opposing alliances are equal. The slight imbalance of commencement units is offset geographically and by the combination of Empire individual special abilities.<br/><br/>Upheaval of changing alliances and treaty ramifications, weather and world events are all represented in the game via 160 beautifully designed &ldquo;Battle Cards&rdquo; that play out consequences of battlefield defeats!  These cards balance real history and real-world events with the element of chance and fog of war!<br/><br/>And with Napoleon&rsquo;s Imperium, the more you play, the more your individual rank and prestige grows as you earn both individual and team ranking points with every game!<br/><br/>The average game would run five to six hours but can be campaigned to play for days. And it&rsquo;s straight into the cannon fire or cannon fodder depending on your battle fortunes as an average game would encompass an average of 80 to 100 battles!<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/>Scope: Napoleonic Grand Strategic<br/>Complexity: 6 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 4 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: 1 Turn = 1 Year<br/>Map Scale: Global map centred on Europe, North Africa<br/>Unit Scale: 10,000 men per Infantry unit, 2,000 men per Cavalry unit, 50 cannon per Artillery unit, 5 ships of the line per Fleet unit<br/>Playing Time: 4-6 hours for Battle Point Game, 6-15 hours for Campaign Game depending upon skill of players. Each year of play takes approximately 40 minutes to one hour to complete.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Freedom is a fun, cooperative, open world, free-roaming, space-themed board game.<br/><br/>Explore unknown worlds, discover alien civilizations, and decide who will be your ally or your enemy. Perform missions to increase your reputation with your allies while planning for and surviving attacks from numerous other alien races. Upgrading your ship and enhancing your heroes is the key to survival.<br/><br/>Will you become a space merchant, trading legal&mdash;or even illegal&mdash;commodities? Are you more of a scientist, unraveling the mysteries of strange space phenomena, or maybe a hunter of dangerous monsters living on exotic planets? Will the wealth lure you into becoming a space pirate, ambushing frigates? Or will the irresistible fame from saving entire worlds lead you to engage enemy space monsters? Probably all of the above.<br/><br/>Sail into the vastness of space aboard the starship Freedom in its three-year quest: A fully replayable campaign that consists of 36 standalone sessions lasting 60 minutes each. In every session, you get to pilot your ship in any direction, so you choose the challenges you will engage and write your own story. No two campaigns are ever the same.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>In a game session of U.S.S. Freedom, you continue your journey from where you left off the session before&mdash;think of it like watching a single episode of a sci-fi TV series. A game session consists of five phases.<br/><br/>Interstellar Phase<br/>Set up the Interstellar Board with all the miniatures in their positions from your previous game session. Then, the various Spaceships and Titans move. If they did not move onto the same hex as your ship, then it is time for you to move.<br/><br/>Navigate Phase<br/>Your ship may move toward any adjacent hex.  Your ship scanners warn you of what lies in all directions. Create the Encounter Deck by shuffling all cards of your level that belong to your adjacent sectors. Then you randomly place one card in each direction. Look at the different Encounters you have and select one to move toward.<br/><br/>Encounter Phase<br/>After selecting the Encounter you will face, roll the Encounter Roll. If the Encounter is an Alien Colony or Alien Starship, add your Reputation to the result. You then flip the Encounter Card and see how it plays according to the Encounter Result and the nature of your Encounter. Some Aliens may simply attack you while others may offer you Missions.<br/><br/>Combat Phase<br/>A lot of Encounters will lead to combat, whether through Missions or direct conflict. Some battles will be carried out by the U.S.S. Freedom, while in other cases your heroes will have to fight on the planet surface, in enemy bases, or even inside the U.S.S. Freedom. Sometimes battles may be carried out simultaneously with the U.S.S. Freedom fighting in space while an away team fights a ground battle.<br/><br/>Each kind of enemy has different abilities that they use during the battle, revealed by flipping the top chip from the stack of Enemy Ability Chips.<br/><br/>Luckily, your heroes also have abilities. They are used for everything from attacks on the enemies to using skills such as Engineering or Willpower. Heroes use their Aether to activate their abilities. Each player has an Aether Pouch and draws different colored Crystals representing the Aether that empowers the heroes&rsquo; Abilities.<br/><br/>In space combat, heroes use the Engine to produce Power and distribute it to all decks of the ship. Heroes across the ship use this Power to fly the Starship, attacking with Weapons or raising Shields.<br/><br/>Conclude Phase<br/>Succeeding enables you to continue your mission. You get rewards according to the Encounter, you may trade commodities, or you may even get to upgrade your ship.<br/><br/>This will conclude one game session. You may pack everything into your Campaign pouch and continue another day from where you left. Or&hellip;if you have another hour, you could play just one more game session!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You and your rivals are surfers trying to gain the most points by catching the best collection of waves by the end of the game, dodging bluebottle stings, scoring bonus points from surfboards that match the waves you catch, and by satisfying each game&rsquo;s 3 unique goals.<br/><br/>3 incoming waves are always visible to all surfers, who select and simultaneously reveal a 1 to 5 energy card they commit to catch the wave (worth 1 to 10 points) in the breakzone closest to the beach. The highest energy card revealed wins the wave, which is collected to be scored at the end of the game. However tied energy cards will cause surfers to wipe out, giving the next highest energy card surfer the win. &lsquo;Respect&rsquo; is the tiebreaker here, and a resource players can gain OR use to buy extra energy and surfboard (bonus point) cards from the beach when they win, or place second on each wave.<br/><br/>The catch is that when you win and take a wave, the energy card you used is trashed (removed from the game), weakening your remaining energy, while the second place and other surfers discard their energy cards and may regain them later. So there is some advantage in coming second and strategically gaining more respect OR buying cards from the beach&hellip;<br/><br/>Surfboards bought from the beach with respect add bonus victory points to some wave types, skewing the value of certain waves for some surfers as the game progresses. Temporary energy bought from the beach gives surfers an edge in later rounds. Bluebottle stingers sometimes blow into the breakzone, and players must avoid playing the lowest energy cards to escape their hidden sting (0 to -3 points on the underside of each chosen bluebottle token). Or bravely take a sting to save a playable card for the next wave! Players running low on energy can rest (pass) to gain 1 respect, and regain their previously discarded energy cards.<br/><br/>The ideal play is to commit just enough energy to win a wave as efficiently as possible at the right time. And then carefully choose when you take more respect (max 4), or when to the beach and what you buy.<br/><br/>The game end is triggered when either:<br/><br/>1. All 5 bluebottles have been resolved, or <br/>2. Any player only has their zero energy card left.<br/><br/>The player with the most points between waves caught, matching surfboards, bluebottle stings and end game goals wins.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

But as the Union troops advanced on Corinth, the Confederates hit back, staking everything on a furious battle in the woods around Shiloh Church.<br/>GRANT MOVES SOUTH puts you in command of the Tennessee campaign.  As General Grant, you must combine river and overland movement to strike deep into rebel territory against the important points of Nashville, Corinth, Memphis, and Columbus.  As the Confederate General, A.S. Johnston, you must use careful maneuver and counterattacks to prevent the ever-growing torrent of Bluecoats from conquering Tennessee.<br/><br/>GRANT MOVES SOUTH shows the critical importance of the road net, water movement and the abilities of individual division commanders.  The fog of war is thick as you know where the enemy is, but not how strong he is.  Gunboats attack river forts, and steamers whisk troops deep into enemy territory.<br/><br/>",

But other enemy rodents will do anything they can to stop you from climbing that tree and snatching those precious snacks.<br/><br/>To claim a nut card in Get Nuts, a player must move his squirrel down a trail composed of four cards in order to reach the nut stash in the center of the table. Squirrels don't just saunter down shady paths, however, so you need to play tree cards on the path to give the squirrel a way to navigate toward the nuts. On a turn, a player has four action points available, with which he can play cards from his hand (which cost 0-4 points) or advance his squirrel down the trees on his trail, with each space costing a point. At the end of a player's turn, he can discard any number of cards he wants, then refill his hand to five cards.<br/><br/>Cards can either help you or attack opponents. Use a sacred tree to provide a safe haven that others can't destroy, and place the Divine Nut on your path, a special treat that can be claimed only after taking a nut from the stash. Take chainsaws and flamethrowers to opponents' trees, or send a bullzoer up their trail to demolish trees one by one over several turns. If your squirrel sits in a tree that's felled, it moves back down the trail and will remain injured until you take the time to administer first aid and get the little guy up and running once again.<br/><br/>If you claim a nut, your squirrel scampers back to the start of the trail, and you must remove trees from your trail equal to the value of that nut. (Trees wither from loneliness when they lose their nuts.) The game ends once the last nut card has been claimed, and the player with the most valuable stash wins.<br/><br/>",

Players must manage their hands carefully, saving their powerful cards for just the right moment and setting careful traps for their opponent in order to win the most valuable travellers over the course of the game.<br/><br/>The game consists of 104 cards, divided into 3 decks. Each deck has a different, seasonal, background. The 2 otherwise identical player decks contain outlaw, leader, special outlaw, weapon, and ransom cards, and valuable Traveller cards make up the third.<br/><br/>The game is illustrated by Heather Young.<br/><br/>The original version of Sherwood Showdown was created for the Traditional Card Game contest, using a deck of tarot playing cards.  The rules and files for this version will remain available here, but please note that game play is significantly different between the printed and tarot versions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Demonslayer: The Siege of Mt. Kunlun is what is called a 'deck-building game,' for up to four players. The game is based on the story &ldquo;Warriors of Magic Mountain.&rdquo; Each player takes control of one Sect of the Kunlun Immortals, and they must compete with each other in defeating the dread forces of the Heart-Eaters. By defeating the Heart-Eaters, each player accumulates Cultivation. At the end of the game, once all the Heart-Eaters are defeated, the player with the most Cultivation is the winner.<br/><br/>Every turn, players play a &ldquo;hand&rdquo; of cards, building up the player&rsquo;s &ldquo;ready deck&rdquo; and attacking the demon enemies. In each turn, players can &quot;obtain&quot; a card once, and attack once. Players can obtain spells as well as obtain &quot;meditation&quot; cards which are used to obtain more, stronger cards.  Players may also &quot;obtain&quot; Immortal warriors from their Immortal Roster area; Immortals are the foot-soldiers in the war against the Heart-Eaters.<br/><br/>Each turn of the game is strategically important; one wrongly played hand can mean the difference between first and last place.<br/><br/>There are four Sects of Immortals in Demonslayer, and each plays differently from each other. The Kunlun Sect excels at bringing high-powered Immortal warriors out quickly, each building on the other&rsquo;s strength. The Qicheng sect is good at calling on reserve Immortals to join the battle. The Kongtong Sect is proficient at Alchemy; creating powerful artifacts which help the Sect in it&rsquo;s battle&rsquo;s against the Heart Eaters. The noble Wuyi Sect Immortal Warriors sacrifice themselves for devastating combo attacks. Every sect also has 1 Sect Leader Immortal, who provides special powers which serve to define how the sect plays.<br/><br/>The enemy of the game are the &ldquo;Heart-Eaters;&rdquo; demonic warriors who have attained immortality by reveling in lustful destruction and excess. Many of the heart eaters have spiritual parasites &ndash; called &ldquo;Miasma&rdquo; which infect the players after slaying. However, players also sometimes attack &ldquo;Treasure Beasts&rdquo; which can grant players special abilities once they are won.<br/><br/>In one &quot;wave&quot; of Demonslayer, there are 8 Heart Eaters and one &quot;Overlord;&quot; a leader of that wave of Heart-Eaters. Demonslayer: Siege of Mt. Kunlun is not, strictly speaking, a game of inter-player competition. Players compete with each other to have the honor of being the most successful at protecting the heavens and Earth from the demon hoards. Yet, players are are essentially cooperating to defeat the enemy.<br/><br/>This English-language version of the game already incorporates one expansion, called The Alchemist's Fortune. In time, we will release new expansions for you to enjoy, incorporating more players, more cards, more options, more strategy, and most of all &ndash; more fun.<br/><br/>",

Stay one step ahead of your opponents, as you race to be the first player to play all your country cards within the confines of your available table space, and win the game.<br/>Block your opponents by holding on to China or India or open up the Gulf States by playing Saudi Arabia. Take a boat through the Pacific Ocean to Australia or transit by train through Thailand to Malaysia. Try not to get stuck with Singapore, or landlocked with Laos as you watch the country cards spread across the table. The excitement builds as you have fewer and fewer cards left to play, but less space to play them in as you reach the edge of the world. (The table&rsquo;s edge). Every country card is different due to their varying border connections and hence no two games are ever the same in this clever game that you will want to play again and again. Play as a stand alone game or combine with Mapominoes games for other continents to make to expand the game to cover the world. A simple game with hidden strategic depth that gives it broad appeal to both children and adults.<br/><br/>",

The winner of that trick is the player who played the highest card of color to be followed or the Trump color, if it has been played. The color of the trump of each round is determined by a list of cards in the middle of the table placed in the setup. The winner of each trick takes all the cards played, besides the card that determines the trump of the round, and places them in rows in his player area, separated by existing symbols. At the end of the game, each player gets victory points for each type of symbol that has, depending on the amount. Up to 3 symbols of a particular type, the score is positive. 4 to 6 symbols of the same type the score is negative. 7 or 8 symbols of the same type score is again positive. All cards 13 are time bombs, worth negative points, except that the same player has captured all 4! The winner has the most victory points!<br/><br/>",

(Toire o Yogoshita nowa Dareda) in English means 'Who Soiled the Toilet?'<br/><br/>Who Soiled the Toilet? is a deduction game with hidden identities. The game box is 15cm round, not square. The game is published in Japanese with rules available in English, German and French.<br/><br/>At beginning of the game, each player is dealt one secret identity card, which is either a clean keeper or a soiler. They play five rounds. The soilers win the game if the toilet is soiled three times out of these five rounds. Otherwise the clean keepers win.<br/><br/>A round is either a regular round or an action round. In a regular round, a leader sends a certain number of players to the toilet in order. The toilet is initially clean (clean side of the toilet card is up), but when a soiler enters the toilet, that player may soil the toilet, secretly flipping the toilet card to dirty-side-up. After all designated players are done, The toilet card is revealed to all players. Soilers win the round if the toilet is dirty. Players should discuss and deduce who are the soilers.<br/><br/>In an action round, place the toilet bowl (the game box) on the table, and players take turns trying to throw a poo chip into the toilet bowl from two-card length away. The clean keepers win the round if a certain number of poo chips are in the toilet bowl. Otherwise the soilers win that round. Players should discuss who missed the throw intentionally.<br/><br/>It is recommended the toilet card be placed on an actual toilet because it adds more reality and laughter to players' conversation. To do so, keep the toilet clean, of course!<br/><br/>Publisher's summary<br/>トイレを綺麗に使う側と汚す側の２チームに分かれて行う正体隠匿系のゲームです。５ラウンド行い３ラウンド勝利したチームが勝ちます。通常ラウンドではリーダーが選んだ人物が順番にトイレに向かいます。最後に皆で確認して、よろれていた場合は誰がトイレを汚したのかを議論します。ACTIONラウンドでは全員がウンコチップを便器型の箱に投げて乗せます。外れたらトイレが汚れ汚れてしまいますが、わざと汚したのか失敗したかを読み取って議論します。実際にトイレを使って遊ぶととても盛り上がる楽しいゲームです。とても笑えるゲームです。<br/><br/>",

There are two types:<br/><br/>Munchies - If you draw one of these, i means you've found a snack. In addition, you get a bonus power. Unless the power says &quot;Play this card immediately&quot;, you may choose when to play it. You can play as many cards as you like on any turn and discard them after use.<br/><br/>Monster - Eight are in the deck. The first 7 are set aside when drawn, but if you draw the 8th, you are out of the game. Place your cards face up where all players can see them. Shuffle the 8th monster card back into the &quot;?&quot; deck as it may be drawn again.<br/><br/>2 Player or teams do not use the ? cards. With just 2 players or teams, take the top 5 cards from the deck and place them face down next to the game board during set up.<br/>During the game, ask questions as normal.

Each Armati army can be assembled in three sizes, so that players may build them to suit both their financial resources and desired &quot;look.&quot; 130 armies are included, divided into six periods, thereby permitting a greater array of &quot;eligible&quot; opponents within each period. the game is mechanically simple - a battle can be fought in less than two hours even when using the advanced rules.<br/><br/>Armati emphasizes careful battle-planning and execution on the part of the player-general, as modified by the particular army system the general commands. Armati stresses the tactical generalities inherent in warfare rather than the exceptional battlefield occurrences in particular battles. To reduce the advantages of a player's &quot;helicopter view&quot; and to provide a more believable simulation of ancient warfare, Armati does not permit the free-wheeling unit maneuvers common to other rules sets. Unit movement is controlled, especially when in close proximity to the enemy. the General's plan of battle is critical to success because it cannot be altered from moment to moment.<br/><br/>Armati represents soldier types based on their tactical usage rather than their weapons and armor, although equipment contributes to a unit's fighting efficiency. Armati's combat system emphasizes tactical situation management not theoretical weapon effectiveness.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Black Death is the game of plagues for 2 to 6 players. Each player is a different strain of disease in 14th century Europe, and whoever racks up the highest body count wins. The map is based on the trade routes and major population centers of Europe at the time, the events are based on historical events, and the rules are interspersed with grim quotes from the survivors. It is a game of conquest and strategy, just a different sort of conquest than your average wargame.<br/><br/>Component list: Black Death includes color and greyscale 15 x 20 inch maps (tiled for normal printers and single sheet for large format printers), six disease tracks, 150 counters, two player aid sheets and twenty event cards. It will take anywhere from half an hour to an hour to assemble it, depending on the work you put into it.<br/><br/>Play notes: Black Death is unusual in that it is a kind of conquest and area control game, but your score is based on infected populations dying off, which removes your counters from play. So you are simultaneously gaining ground in one spot and choosing to lose it in another. Depending on the Virulence and Mortality of your particular strain of a disease, the strategies you can use will vary. The game can be played with 2 people, but like most games of this sort, it works best with 3 or more.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Black Death<br/><br/><br/>",

A piece of string is passed through these tiles and knots are made at the 3, 5 and 6 feet marks. A record sheet inserted in a clear holder shows ship characteristics and a grease marker is used to mark damage.<br/><br/>Players physically move their ships by measuring distance with a ruler. During combat, player must estimate their firing angle. The string is pulled along that angle and the enemy ship is hit if the string passes over it.<br/><br/>",

Here, each player plays, all at once, as many cards face-up in front of himself as he wishes or he passes. After all players have done this, scoring occurs. Players compare the total number of their played cards. Only cards displaying the characteristic of the current Location card and Gandalf cards played in the column with the matching characteristic are counted. Whoever has the most cards of the appropriate type takes the highest point tile at that Location and the Ring (he is the start player for the next round). The player with second-most cards of the appropriate type takes the next highest point tile and so on - the player with the fewest matching cards gets nothing. <br/>The player who has earned the most points by the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

A game of Lasting Tales will also require a handful of standard six-sided dice, a tape measure or ruler, and miniatures. Fortunately, Lasting Tales is a miniatures-agnostic game, meaning players can use any fantasy miniatures in their collection.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is played using a deck of 103 cards, consisting of:<br/><br/><br/>    84 number cards, numbered 1 to 21 in four colors;<br/>    15 connection cards;<br/>    4 jokers.<br/><br/><br/>There are also seven bonus cards used in scorekeeping.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the eleven of each color is placed in the middle of the table in a column. The other number cards and the jokers are shuffled together, and each player receives a number of those cards as well as a number of connection cards. The goal of the game is to play all of your number and joker cards by building a grid &ndash; four rows, each from one to twenty-one.<br/><br/>Each turn, you may play up to four cards from your hand. If you cannot play a card, or don't want to, you draw one card from the draw pile. The cards must be played according to the following rules:<br/><br/>    You must place a number card next to a card that is one higher or lower of the same color and that is already on the table. So, the red twelve must be placed next to the red eleven, and the red thirteen must be placed next to the red twelve (or in front of the red fourteen). So, the red thirteen cannot be played if neither the twelve nor the fourteen has been played unless you use a connection card.<br/>    Alternatively, you can use a connection card to place a card above or below a card with the same number and a different color. For example, if the green row is above the yellow row, and the green nine has already been played, you may use a connection card to play the yellow nine in the yellow row. The connection cards are not part of your hand, so they don't count toward the maximum of four cards that you may play during a round.<br/>    A joker may be placed instead of any other number cards. If a player has a number card whose spot is occupied by a joker, he may exchange that card for the joker.<br/><br/><br/>If a player completes a segment from one to eleven or from eleven to twenty-one, he receives a bonus card.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has played the last card from his hand. Then, points are counted:<br/><br/>    Each bonus card is worth 11 points.<br/>    Each number card that a player still holds is worth as many minus points as its value.<br/>    Each joker that a player still holds is worth 11 minus points.<br/><br/><br/>The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You're a master villain of a sinister secret society with a plan to take over the world! Send your minions around the globe to execute nefarious plots such as marketing evil soda, hijacking a nuclear submarine, building a time portal, or ruining a beloved movie property. Each turn you&rsquo;ll send your minions to exotic locales such as London, Cairo, Machu Picchu, or Antarctica to gather the resources you need to carry out your plans: Finance, Occult, Science, and of course Unobtainium. Watch out for your opponents&mdash;they&rsquo;re trying to pull off their own schemes. Each sinister plot you execute is but one small part of your secret Ultimate Scheme!<br/><br/>A game turn consists of five steps: draw new schemes, move minions (perform twice), collect resources (perform twice), execute schemes, and the end step. Players perform each step in play order, so if Player 1 collects the resources in Cairo, Player 2 can't get Cairo's resources that turn. During the course of the turn, players move their minions to sites and collect the resources each site provides. Then they pay resources to execute schemes held in their hand, and earn progress points toward victory by doing so. To execute a scheme, a player must meet the scheme resource cost, and have a minion located in the scheme's site (for example, to subvert the U.N., a player must have a minion in New York). Action cards give players special advantages in moving minions, collecting resources, gaining new minions, or destroying enemy minions. The &quot;first player&quot; rotates each turn.<br/><br/>Each player begins the game with a secret &quot;Ultimate Scheme&quot; card such as Ruin Christmas or Destroy Rock 'n' Roll. The Ultimate Scheme card dictates how many progress points the player needs to win, and what *kind* of schemes he or she needs to pull off. The game ends at the end of the turn in which the first player to complete his or her Ultimate Scheme does so. If multiple players finish their Ultimate Scheme on the same turn, various tiebreakers determine victory -- but the easiest way to win is to be the first villain to pull off your grand plan.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from ATO website)<br/><br/>Operation Cartwheel was a miniaturized version of Allied Grand Strategy in the Pacific&mdash;a multi-pronged advance aimed to make it difficult for the Japanese to focus their responses... a jumping from air base to potential-next-airbase. (MacArthur called it, &ldquo;Advancing the bomber line.&rdquo;) And, most of all, the novel concept that not every Japanese stronghold needed to be attacked at all.<br/><br/>Some 13 different invasions or operations were included, with flexibility for adjusting both timing and target as the situation demanded. In fact, the original goal of Cartwheel (called &ldquo;Elkton&rdquo; when first proposed) was the capture of Rabaul. After much discussion in the highest levels (including the Combined Chiefs of Staff, Roosevelt, and Churchill), and overruling MacCarther&rsquo;s own objections, Cartwheel&rsquo;s final objectives shifted to the Admiralty Islands, bypassing Rabaul and setting the stage for the invasion of the Philippines.<br/><br/>Operation Cartwheel eventually included the Battle of the Bismarck Sea, the death of Yamamoto, Bougainville, multiple parachute drops, a Japanese counter-invasion, and the leap-frogging strategy up New Guinea. It involved the top commanders on both sides, sometimes working in close harmony and sometimes at ends. (The Japanese army and navy had conflicting concepts of how to defend the area and each pursued their own ideas!)<br/><br/>With 284 5/8&quot; counters and a 22 x 34 inch map (each hex representing about 100 miles) Operation Cartwheel integrates separate ground, naval, and air games. Logistics is key, as it was at the time, but not a burden in game mechanics.<br/><br/>Operation Cartwheel will be published in ATO's 2008 Annual, featuring a &ldquo;double-length&rdquo; magazine, with an in-depth look at the history behind the game, plus other articles, and an assortment of replacement/improvement counters from that year&rsquo;s games.[...]<br/><br/>NOW AVAILABLE AGAIN!<br/><br/>Game has been OOP for years.
