Now it's time to live that dream!<br/><br/>In Best Treehouse Ever, players compete to build their best treehouse, outfitting their treehouse with cool rooms, while also making sure that their tree doesn't tip over and that their rooms are more impressive than all of their friends' rooms at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Building takes place over three weeks/rounds, and in each round, players use card drafting and spatial reasoning to add five new rooms to their treehouse. Players must pay attention to the other treehouses being built since they take turns determining which types of rooms score for everyone at the end of each round.<br/><br/>At the end of the third week, the winner is the player with the best treehouse ever!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Many years after the confrontation with Van Helsing, Dracula landed in Whitby, England once again. The citizens of Whitby sought help from the vampire hunter, Professor Van Helsing. Will Van Helsing defeat Dracula before he transforms all the inhabitants into vampires?<br/><br/>In Dracula vs Van Helsing, each player controls one of the title characters. Van Helsing must remove all of Dracula's life points to win, but if Dracula turns all four inhabitants of the same district into vampires first, Dracula wins.<br/><br/>The game lasts at most five rounds. Each round, players play in turn (starting with Dracula), drawing a card, then discarding that card or swapping it with one of the five cards on their rack to trigger the discarded card's ability. Cards come in eight types, each with its own effect. Instead of drawing (and discarding) a card, a player can call for the end of the round. In order to choose this action, at least six cards need to be in the discard pile. After the opponent plays one last turn, the round ends; otherwise, the round ends when the deck is empty.<br/><br/>At the end of a round, players compare the five cards on their rack. Each card corresponds to one of the five districts on the game board. If Dracula has the higher-valued card, one of the humans in this district is converted into a vampire; if Van Helsing is higher, Dracula loses a health point. If one of the game-winning conditions is met, the game ends immediately.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Phantom Leader &ndash; Solitaire<br/><br/>What&rsquo;s New in the Deluxe Edition?<br/>We have expanded and updated the original Phantom Leader game to the high standard set by our Hornet Leader game.<br/><br/>Increase the cards from 165 to 330 <br/>- All pilots get all 6 experience levels <br/>- Add new aircraft: Air Force F-5, Air Force A-7 <br/>- Add more pilots for all aircraft types <br/>- Add more Target cards <br/>- Add more Special Event cards <br/>- Revise the 6 original Campaigns to include the new Targets and Aircraft<br/><br/>Add Air Force and Navy Campaigns for the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis<br/><br/>Upgrade to a mounted 11&quot;x17&quot; Tactical Display<br/><br/>Description:<br/>Phantom Leader places you in command of a US Air Force or US Navy Tactical Fighter squadron in Vietnam between 1964 and 1972. You must not only destroy the targets but you must also balance the delicate political repercussions of your attacks. If you strike too hard, your air offensive might be put on hold, strike to light, and you&rsquo;ll be blamed for losing the war.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Vietnam Air War!<br/><br/>Each of the campaigns can be played with either an Air Force or Navy squadron. The targets assigned to each service are different and change the complexion of the campaigns. Each campaign can be played with three different durations of: Skirmish, Conflict, or War.<br/><br/>Each mission takes roughly 30 minutes to set-up, plan, and resolve.<br/><br/>Each of your pilots has their own skills. Selecting the right pilots and weapons for a mission is vital to its success. As you fly missions, your pilots will gain experience and fatigue. With experience, their skills improve, but as their fatigue increases, their skills decrease and they might not be able to fly for several missions.<br/><br/>For those of you familiar with our modern era Hornet Leader series of games, you might be wondering what&rsquo;s different about Phantom Leader&hellip;<br/><br/>The freedom of being able to select the best mission based on military objectives is something that is commonplace for today&rsquo;s military. Back in Vietnam, the military was responsible for carrying out their orders, while at the same time being extremely limited in the weapons and tactics they were allowed to use to complete those orders. In many cases, the specific weapons, approach paths, and bombing altitudes were generated target-by-target at the White House. The mission specifics were then sent down the chain of command to the individual pilots flying the mission. As you can imagine, this was not the best way to run an air campaign.<br/><br/>Every target has a Political value. If you destroy it, you move the Political counter to the right a number of spaces equal to its value. As the counter gets moved to the right, your future target choices are reduced to those that are less politically sensitive. Which target you choose not to attack is also important. You get to move the Political counter to the left a number of spaces equal its Political value.<br/><br/>This means that while you might like to flatten a big enemy target and rack up the victory points, it might be better for you to choose a pointless target and move the Political counter in your favor instead.<br/><br/>Another difference is in combat power. For the last couple decades, the US Air Force and Navy have enjoyed air superiority due to training and technology. Such was not the case in the skies over Vietnam. The enemy had different, but just as capable, equipment. They also had the training and will to use it to its utmost.<br/><br/>They soon became aware of the limitations placed on the US forces by the politicians, and used those limitations to their advantage.<br/><br/>For example, at times, US pilots were not permitted to fire on enemy aircraft until they were visually identified. This negated any range advantage conveyed by the radar-homing AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. It was also a common limitation that enemy aircraft could only be attacked in the air. US pilots were not allowed to attack enemy airbases. US aircraft were also limited to flying predictable flight paths, at set times. This made setting up ambushes much easier for the enemy.<br/><br/>So, while you might be a Hornet Leader ace, Vietnam is a whole different ballgame!<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player reveals the top indicator card from the deck of fourteen cards, then each player individually and simultaneously chooses a subway line, then does something depending on which type of card is revealed:<br/><br/><br/>    If a number is revealed, the player writes the number in one of that line's indicator boxes, then draws a X in each box in the line starting with the closest empty box, stopping when they've reached the end of the line, reached an already filled-in space, or drawn the indicated number of Xs.<br/>    If a circled number is revealed, the player does what is described above, but they can skip over already filled-in spaces instead of stopping.<br/>    If a star is revealed, the player draws a star in one of that line's indicator boxes, then in the closest empty space on that line they write a number equal to double the number of lines that pass through that station box.<br/>    If a circle is revealed, the player writes nothing in an indicator box and draws a X in any empty station box.<br/><br/><br/>At the end of a turn, if a player has finished a subway line by reaching the final space, they announce this to all players, then score the larger of the two bonuses for this line; all other players cross out the large bonus and can score the small bonus for themselves if they complete this line later. Multiple players can score a line's bonus on the same turn. If the indicator card has a shuffle icon on it, shuffle all of the indicator cards together before the next turn.<br/><br/>Once all the indicator boxes are filled, the game ends. Players tally their points scored for completing lines and for writing numbers in boxes, then lose points based on the number of empty spaces that remain on their sheet. Whoever has the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1870 &ndash; Somewhere deep in Texas, the rearing of Longhorn cattle from northern Mexico is booming. It has now become a major source of income for the Texan farmers, while at the same time attracting cattle thieves of all kinds.<br/><br/>In Longhorn, the players assume the roles of two particularly feared outlaws: Eagle Perkins and Jessie Artist Byrd. The aim of the game is simple: to steal cattle (and a few gold nuggets, if possible) to see who can amass the most money by the end of the game &mdash; or who can get his opponent arrested by the sheriff!<br/><br/>The game is set up by shuffling the 9 locations and setting them up in a 3x3 grid, selecting 9 tokens randomly and assigning one to each location (if the sheriff token is in play, it must be placed on Nugget Hill), and finally randomly distributing the coloured longhorn cattle meeples to each location, with the number required being shown on each location. The start player then chooses a location with 4 cattle and places the player piece in it.<br/><br/>The game ends in one of three ways:<br/>- If a player takes the sheriff token, they lose immediately<br/>- If a player takes all 9 cattle of any one colour, they win immediately (if they did both in the same turn, they lose)<br/>- If no legal move can be made, the players score; gold nugget tokens are worth their face value and each colour of longhorn is worth $100 for each cow of the same colour still on the board. For example, if the Perkins player has 4 black cattle and 5 are left on the board, each of his 4 black longhorns are worth $500. If there are no black cattle (because the Byrd player has them, or through drought) then they are worth nothing. The player with the highet total wins.<br/><br/>On a players turn, they choose a colour of longhorn present in their location and steal all of that colour. For each longhorn stolen, the player moves the player piece that many spaces and then flips it, to signify that it is now the other player's turn.<br/><br/>If a location is cleared of longhorn cattle, the player who took the last longhorn must take the token present and activate it. Some are positive and some are negative. Once a space is cleared, it can not be moved to in a future turn, though it can be moved through.<br/><br/>",

In each of these titles, players are presented with a mysterious story that they must unravel over the course of play. Working together, players explore common areas, talk to people, look for clues, and combine various items to reveal the secret of the story. Depending on what decisions the players make, the course of history changes and there is no going back!<br/><br/>Unlike the co-operative EXIT: The Game series, titles in this series focus on the telling and discovery of the story with no time pressure. That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.<br/><br/>In Monochrome Inc., players have been instructed to break into the research building named in the game's title, and once they get inside this tower's mirrored windows, they are left on their own. What they find there, what conclusions they draw from these items, and how this nerve-wracking story ends is entirely in their hands. Only by co-ordinating their team will they avoid potential pitfalls, carry out their mission, and solve the mystery of this building.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Patchwork Express features the same basic gameplay as Patchwork, but with a smaller playing area and with larger and less complex pieces.<br/><br/>In the game, each player tries to build the most aesthetic (and high-scoring) patchwork quilt on a personal 7x7 game board. To start play, lay out all of the light-colored patches at random in a circle and place a starting marker in a particular location. Each player takes some buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the starting marker or passes. To purchase a patch, you pay the cost in buttons shown on the patch, move the starting marker to that patch's location in the circle, add the patch to your game board, then advance your time token on the time track a number of spaces equal to the time shown on the patch. You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.<br/><br/>In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.<br/><br/>What's more, the time track depicts six 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place six actual 1x1 patches on these spaces. Whoever first passes a patch on the time track claims this patch and immediately places it on their game board.<br/><br/>At some point during the game, dark-colored patches are added to what's available for players to take, and these pieces are smaller than the light-colored ones, making it more likely that they'll fill in holes on a player's board.<br/><br/>",

All our cargo was thrown overboard, and now we must save that precious cargo &mdash; as well as our captain! &mdash; and escape from the raging gigantic octopus from the deep.&quot;<br/><br/>In Crash Octopus, players race to collect cargo that's floating in the ocean, while surrounded by a horrifically giant octopus. The first player who collects all five types of cargo on their ship wins.<br/><br/>The game is played by using the table as the landscape, with a string perimeter around the playing area. To set up, place the octopus head at the center of the playing area, surrounded by the tentacles spread out at an equal distance, then the player ships and anchors outside of the tentacles near the perimeter. Finally, you drop all the cargo onto the playing area by bouncing it off the octopus' head.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player uses their flag to either navigate &mdash; by flicking the anchor next to their ship, then moving their ship to touch the anchor &mdash; or flick cargo. Cargo comes in five types &mdash; goblet, chest, gem, gold, and captain (yes, really!) &mdash; and you can flick any type of cargo that's not on your ship toward your ship. The only exception is that you can't flick the single cargo item closest to your ship. If the flicked cargo misses your ship, your turn ends; if it hits your ship, you load that cargo, then advance the cargo tracker, which is a string of beads on the perimeter.<br/><br/>If you advance a black bead on the cargo tracker, the octopus attacks! Each player takes a turn dropping a die and bouncing it off the octopus' head, possibly moving the head or a tentacle to get in the way of others picking up cargo and possibly knocking cargo off a ship. What a setback!<br/><br/>",

From these, they draw a starting hand of nine. Players then decide where to place their citadel and which tiles will be placed with it. The tiles are multi-use. When placed on the board, they becomes units, with the type indicated by the symbol in the center. In your hand, tiles can be used to build other units, move units, improve your combat strength, build villages, and raid villages.<br/><br/>The main part of the game proceeds with player turns. On your turn, you can perform as many actions as you wish, although some actions have restrictions as to when you can perform them. After you have completed your actions, draw back to your hand size of six tiles. If you exhaust your stock of tiles, then shuffle your discarded ones to make a new draw stock. You also score victory points for villages you have on the board.<br/><br/>The game ends when each player has scored points a number of times. With two players, this will be three times; for three or more players, two times.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In Twisted Fables players take on the roles of beloved heroines from some of history's most famous stories, myths, and legends. Plucked from their traditional settings, these characters have been thrown into a world of cybernetic assassins, magical manipulations, and malevolent darkness. These are not the classic characters you remember, but rather superpowered fables drawn from their own lands to battle across sweeping, bizarre alternate dimensions and realities. What mysterious force has drawn them together? What is the purpose of their war? Only the Weaver of Tales knows for certain.<br/><br/>Driven by deck building, Twisted Fables is a game for two players in 1v1 Mode or four players in 2v2 Mode (available with the separately released 2v2 Upgrade Pack.) In the game, each warrior will strengthen their abilities, learn potent new skills, unlock devastating special powers, and use unique asymmetric strategies to defeat their opponents. Even the same character may display completely different fighting styles depending on her player's decisions. The different specializations a character can choose from not only provide fantastically flexible tactical choices, but also offer one more layer of depth and surprise to this frenetic, frantic fighter. Twisted Fables brings a highly interactive experience to deck builders that you'll want to come back to again and again.<br/><br/>The book is opened. The fables have arisen.

Creaking floor boards, banging window shutters, strange noises. Behind the wafer-thin walls, no sound remains hidden from eavesdropping ears.<br/>Suddenly: a bang! A scream! Hurried steps fade away&thinsp;&hellip; <br/>Nobody saw anything! But everybody heard everybody else&thinsp;&hellip; There are clues from the hotel guests on all floors. But which of them will be discovered? And which of them will remain hidden? If you don&rsquo;t want a murder rap pinned on you, you should lay the blame on the other players instead. Because one thing is for sure: the overwhelming evidence will convict the culprit.<br/><br/>The players arouse suspicion: they throw their clues (in the form of little wooden cubes) into the shaft of the hotel tower. If you prick up your ears, you&lsquo;ll be able to guess on which floors the suspicious clues come to rest. With this knowledge, you can denounce other players and cover your own tracks.<br/>The culprit is the one who has left particularly suspicious clues in the vicinity of the scene of the crime. Whoever attracts the fewest suspicious facts, wins.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>1 hotel (8 parts)<br/>2 victims (red)<br/>120 clues in 6 colors<br/>1 investigation sheet<br/><br/>",

The defending side comprises twelve soldiers and a king, who start the game in a cross formation in the center of the board. Their objective is for the king to escape by reaching any of the four corner squares. The attackers comprise 24 soldiers positioned in four groups of 6 around the perimeter of the board. All pieces move like the Rook in chess and pieces are taken by &quot;sandwiching&quot; i.e. moving your piece so that an opponent's piece is trapped horizontally or vertically between two of yours. There is a host of information on the Internet about Hnefatafl, including many rule variations that are worth experimenting with.<br/><br/>A copy of the game was published in issue #128 of Dragon magazine, Dec 1987 (later republished as part of a boxed set: The Best of Dragon Magazine Games in 1990).<br/><br/>One of the oldest games in the world - traced in various versions to the Vikings, Welsh, Saxons, and Irish. The origins of this game can be traced through Petteia, played by the Romans, to the even older versions played by the Ancient Greeks and Egyptians.<br/><br/>Derivatives of Hnefatafl include Breakthru, Break Away, Seikkailu Merellä, Tablut and Thud.<br/><br/>",

Each person then distributes a number of points to Start Speed, Top Speed, Wear and other attributes, five points per lap.  Then, each player moves based on their speed, and can adjust their speed, choosing to forfeit a Wear Point, or roll the Chance Die, where a bad roll could cause you to move through, spin out, or even crash out of the race.  Whoever gets over the line first wins.<br/><br/>Before the race begins the players prepare their cars by allocating points, so if you want faster acceleration or speed you have to sacrifice start speed or braking or tire wear.<br/><br/>Each turn, the players write their planned speed for the next turn and then move their cars 1 space per 20 mph. Each curve on the track has a speed limit that cannot be exceeded without penalty. If you exceed curve speed, overaccelerate or overdecelerate your car, etc., you pay penalties in tire wear or possible damage to your car or elimination from the race.<br/><br/>The original 3M Sports Games version used speedometer wheels to select speed, used a random card draw to determine the car characteristics and has no random elements.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>    Speed Circuit: British Grand Prix<br/>    Speed Circuit: Detroit Grand Prix<br/>    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de Belgique<br/>    Speed Circuit: Grand Prix de France<br/>    Speed Circuit: South African Grand Prix<br/>    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 1<br/>    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 2<br/>    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 3<br/>    Speed Circuit: Accessory Pack 4<br/>    Speed Circuit: Tournament Tracks<br/>    Speed Circuit: Turnier Kurs<br/><br/><br/>",

With the money they earn, they can buy adventure cards that earn them precious antiques. Africana features the &quot;Book of Adventures&quot; game system from Schacht's Valdora in which players can acquire cards that are laid out like books, with players &quot;turning the pages&quot; to find the adventure cards they most want.<br/><br/>The game board in Africana shows the continent divided in half at the equator, with the cities in the north half colored brown and the cities in the south white. Adventure cards with a brown border can be acquired only in the south and must be delivered to the north, while white-bordered adventure cards take the opposite route. Five expedition cards &ndash; each showing the starting and ending location and a reward for completing the expedition &ndash; are laid face-up on the game board.<br/><br/>Each player has one researcher token that will travel around the board, and on a turn a player takes one of three possible actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Draw two travel cards. (A player can have no more than five travel cards in hand at turn's end.)<br/>    Buy one or more adventure cards, for five coins each. A player can flip one page in the book for free, with each additional flip costing one coin. (A player can have no more than three adventure cards to be fulfilled at turn's end.)<br/>    Move the researcher by paying travel cards that match the color of the space being traveled to. Each player has a joker in hand, which will be retained at the end of each turn. If a player moves onto the start space of an expedition, he can mark that expedition card with a marker; if he reaches the destination for an expedition he's on, he receives the reward depicted and claims the card, while anyone else on the expedition receives nothing. A new expedition card is then revealed.<br/><br/><br/>When a player reaches the destination shown on an adventure card, that player scores that card by placing it under his player mat. Some cards show helpers, which are represented by helper cards in a player's hand. These cards allow travel on the color shown on the card and return to the player's hand after use, but a player who employs many helps will lose points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Once the expedition cards run out, the game ends and players score for the expeditions they completed, sets of identical and different adventure cards, money in hand, and a few other things. The player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Aspects of gameplay will be familiar to fans of RT, and will add a bit of extra depth and strategy.<br/><br/>In Lizard Wizard, players compete to recruit wizards from seven unique schools of magic, build mystical towers, research powerful spells, summon helpful familiars, and search dark dungeons for gold and items of power. Only one Arch-Mage will rise above the rest and control the land. Will it be you?<br/><br/> <br/>Actions<br/> Lizard Wizard is an action-selection game. On a player&rsquo;s turn, they may perform one of the following six Actions:<br/><br/><br/>1)    GATHER REAGENTS<br/>Just as there are seven schools of magic, there are seven magical reagents, or ingredients, that fuel the magic of Astoria. Knowing where these natural wonders can be found is the essential starting point for every young wizard. Sometimes they use familiars to perform this errand, but it is still very common to find even the most powerful arch-mages lurking in the Enchanted Wood, searching for the most pure reagents.<br/><br/>     Play a Gather Reagents Card<br/>     Take Reagents shown on the &lsquo;Gather Reagents&rsquo; half (plus any on your Wizard Cards)<br/>     Increase the value of the Reagents shown on the &lsquo;Increase Value&rsquo; half<br/>     Cast one spell (if you have the necessary reagents)<br/><br/><br/> <br/>2)    CONVERT REAGENTS TO MANA<br/>Long ago, the wizards of Astoria learned how to convert reagents into mana, the magical energy that powers all things. The process is no longer dangerous, but it still takes great focus and knowledge.<br/><br/>     Turn in one type of reagents to the supply<br/>     Gain Mana = Value of that Reagent x Tokens turned in<br/>     Reduce the Value of that Reagent by the number of Tokens turned in<br/><br/><br/> <br/>3)    RECRUIT WIZARD<br/>The Arch Mages of Astoria are vying for ultimate power, which can only be achieved by drawing several lesser wizards into their circle of influence. They do this through demonstrations of their magical ability. Occasionally, their attempts to recruit a wizard are challenged by one or more rivals, and a Wizard&rsquo;s Duel occurs. These contests of magical power can drain even the most powerful mage.<br/><br/>     Select one of the two Wizard Cards on offer and bid Mana in turn (or pass)<br/>     Winner of the Auction pays the bid and takes the Wizard Card<br/>     If the player who started the Auction didn&rsquo;t win, they may take another Action<br/><br/><br/> <br/>4)    RESEARCH SPELL <br/>Arch-Mages have the ability to learn spells from any of the seven schools of magic. Once they have researched a new spell, it still must be cast with reagents (and the help of a familiar) before it takes effect.<br/><br/>     Select a Spell Card from the four on offer and pay 5 Mana<br/>     Place the Spell Card face down in front of you<br/>     Cast the Spell if you have the necessary Reagents<br/><br/><br/> <br/>5)    CREATE A TOWER <br/>Magical Towers amplify the power of wizards of each school of magic. Towers may be created through powerful magic, or built by workers who must be paid.<br/><br/>     Pay either the Reagents or the Gold shown on the Tower Card on offer<br/>     Take the Tower Card and place it in front of you<br/>     Towers add &lsquo;1&rsquo; to your storage for Reagents<br/><br/><br/> <br/>6)    SUMMON FAMILIAR: <br/>Familiars are magical spirits that are summoned and inhabit the bodies of mortal creatures. They are essential servants who perform many vital services for wizards: They can be used for simple errands, such as gathering reagents or gold. They are the only ones who can locate the ever-shifting entrance to the famous Dungeons of Astoria. They are also essential assistants in the complex rituals required to cast spells.<br/>Use the Card for one of four purposes:<br/>    a) Score one School of Magic (2 Gold/ Card of the same School of Magic as the Familiar)<br/>    b) Gather Reagents shown on the Familiar Card and Cast any number of Spells <br/>    c) Clear the Spell Offer, Replace them with four new Spell Cards and select one for free<br/>    d) Enter the Dungeon<br/><br/>     Draw cards from the top of the Dungeon Deck, stopping when you want<br/>     Monster Cards &lsquo;hit&rsquo;; 2 hits = failure<br/>     If you stop before failure, keep the treasure cards and shuffle the monster cards back into the Dungeon Deck<br/>     If you fail, shuffle all drawn cards back into the Dungeon Deck<br/><br/><br/><br/>End Game and Scoring<br/><br/>The game will end when any one of the following decks is depleted: Familiar, Tower, Wizard, Spell.<br/><br/>When the game ends, the players will score points for each Wizard and Tower Card combo (10 VP if they are of the same school of magic, and 5 VP if they are not), 3 VP for each Spell Card in schools of magic where they have a matching Wizard and Tower, 1 VP for each Gold gathered from the dungeon or from scoring with a Familiar Card, and any points derived from the special abilities from spells.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players use tweezers to &quot;play with fire&quot; and if you drop anything, you're considered a fire hazard and you're removed from the game.

Both players lay the puzzle tiles down in front of them. Rolling the 20 sided die determines which of the tiles are used in the specific rounds. The players then try to solve every puzzle sheet as quickly as possible by laying the appropriate tiles on it. The faster player to do this yells 'Ubongo!' and moves their pawn one step forward on the scoring track. The first player to win five Ubongo duels wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Tarawa covers the landings on Betio Island in November 1943, and the operations of the US 2nd Marine and 27th Infantry Divisions to clear it -- the first heavily contested landing of the Pacific War. The battle for the tiny Island raged for four days and, when it was finally over, fewer than 200 of the 5,000 Japanese defenders remained alive. One map, two counter-sheets and 55 cards.<br/><br/>",

Don't confuse Die Neuen Entdecker (also known as Entdecker: Exploring New Horizons) with Entdecker, a different game. In short - if your Entdecker's board does not have a scout trail leading to native huts, it's not this Entdecker.]<br/><br/>A reworking of the game Entdecker, this game still starts with a blank game board that represents an unexplored sea. Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed, islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, forts, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful explorer.<br/><br/>Completed islands yield victory points to all who have invested in exploration on an island, but of course the most points go to the player who has established the strongest presence. This updated version adds a larger board, fees to enter from all but one edge of the board, a different income system, new bonus waterfall tiles, the ability to draw (for a price) from open stacks of tiles, and most of all an entirely new area of the board that represents scouts exploring jungles on the islands in search of exotic plants (this is the bonus discovery chip system revamped), and other changes.<br/><br/>",

Each player assumes the role of a worker in the tavern.

The Main area, where the guests are located and from where each player must pick up an Order, Cellar where all the ingredients that are used to complete the Orders are located, Kitchen where players can work to receive different rewards, as well as the Chores section. Also, the board features the Wizards workshop where the players can seek help for completing the Orders and Nasty the Dwarf's office where the players can go and try to suck up to the boss and badmouth a coworker.<br/><br/>The players will have to complete the Orders as soon as possible, because for each round they are late, they&rsquo;ll receive less points than the Order's original value.<br/><br/>Also, for being late with the Orders, your reputation with Nasty the Dwarf is affected, something that is vital in the game.<br/><br/>To stand out from other workers and gain your employers favor, you&rsquo;ll need to skillfully manage the orders from your customers and the resource ingredients. You&rsquo;ll have to carefully prioritize your moves, and choose from what kind of work you&rsquo;ll profit the most out of the situation.<br/><br/>So&hellip; do you have what it takes?

Summit uses a unique karma system that allows players to actively help or hinder their opponents &mdash; but it also affects end game scoring.

Summit is a game so grueling you need only one team member to survive the ascent and descent, so players may sacrifice themselves for the good of the team. The mountain has a &quot;Sherpa Track&quot; and a &quot;Time of Day Track&quot; added, as well as a whole new deck of cards. It is unlikely everyone will be returning from this expedition.<br/><br/>With over 190 unique cards, nearly 100 tiles, unique resource management and tracking on dual-layer asymmetrical player mats and the ability to customize your difficulty and game length, Summit guarantees you will never play the same game twice!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It&rsquo;s 1833. The East India Company has just had its monopoly of trade revoked by an official act of Parliament. You, and others like you, see a golden opportunity for profit in China. For too long the Company&rsquo;s polite deference to the Qing has smothered progress and stifled trade. There is real money to be made here and you intend to make it.<br/><br/>An Infamous Traffic is a brutal economic board game for two to five souls brave enough to conduct the opium trade in the fracturing political landscape of 19th century Qing China. Initially, you will need to rely on smugglers in order to get your products into the interior, but, if Parliament can be swayed, perhaps an open war can make the trade more secure. At the same time, you&rsquo;ll want to be careful. If British aggression goes unchecked, the region may become a failed state, which could jeopardize your hard fought gains.<br/><br/>Of course, the massive wealth you&rsquo;ll earn won&rsquo;t be enough. Trade is still a dirty word among those in the top rungs of society. You certainly haven't forgotten how your business holdings were sneered at by some prodigal baronet during your brief stint at Oxford. They don&rsquo;t understand. The empire they enjoy was built on trade, not pedigree. So, you&rsquo;ll play their game, snatching up the precious symbols of nobility with your hard won cash. Perhaps you can restore a beloved castle and stuff it full of the latest luxuries. The right marriage or government post would certainly guarantee your place in society. You might even be tempted to rob your own firm to get that extra edge back home.<br/><br/>In any case, there&rsquo;s demand for opium in China, and you intend to meet it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>See the Living Rules.

        "description": "This new edition of Bruxelles 1893 is completed with its Belle &Eacute;poque expansion, both offered in a single big box. Although it respects the spirit of the original game, this new version of Brussels 1893 has been mechanically, graphically and ergonomically redesigned. Those who love Brussels 1893 will find all the pleasure of the original game, and even more because Belle &Eacute;poque considerably expands the strategic possibilities, without increasing the length of a game.<br/><br/>In the Belle &Eacute;poque expansion, players will experience:<br/><br/><br/>     New Public Figures and White Works of Art<br/>     Blocker Tiles and End Game Goals<br/>     Special Actions and a Brand New Material<br/><br/><br/>Bruxelles 1893 is a worker placement game with elements of bidding and majority control. Each player is an architect of the late 19th century and is trying to achieve, through various actions, an architectural work in the Art Nouveau style. The most successful building yields the most points. Each player can also create works of art to increase his score.<br/><br/>The action board is modular, with not every player having access to each action each turn. Some actions cost money &ndash; acquiring high-quality materials, building a level of your personal house, finding a patron, creating a work of art, selling that art for money and prestige &ndash; while other actions are free but can potentially cause you to lose one of your workers; these latter actions include acquiring low-quality materials, activating your patrons, visiting the stock exchange, and taking one of the actions with a cost. Once everyone has passed on taking more actions, the round ends and players have an art exhibition during which they can sell works. After this, players receive prestige points or bonus cards based on the symbols they've placed their workers next to on the action board.<br/><br/>After five rounds, the game ends and players score bonus points based on their architect level, their bonus cards, how well they've completed their work, and their money on hand. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Medici: The Card Game is a new design by Reiner Knizia that shares the setting and feel of the classic Medici board game, without using that game's auction mechanisms.<br/><br/>In 15th century Florence, players try to acquire the most valuable goods for their merchant ships by drawing 1-3 cards from a common deck each turn. After drawing, the active player must take the final card they drew and may select one or both of the previous two cards drawn (if available). They then load these commodity cards on their boat. Cards that are not taken remain available to future players. Once a player's boat is full (seven cards with two players, five cards with 3-6 players), they are out of the round and the day is scored.<br/><br/>Players score points for the value of their ships' holds, but also for the number of commodities of each type that they have stored in their warehouse. The highest earning merchant over three days wins the game. Some cards do not take up space on ships, while others contribute to the value of a hold, but cannot be stored in warehouses.<br/><br/>This is the first game to be added to the Medici family of games since Strozzi, released in 2008.<br/><br/>",

These untried Soviet counters enter play face down, their combat strength unknown to either player, until they take part in combat, at which time they are flipped to reveal their strength and defense numbers.<br/><br/>The game also models the effectiveness of German operations by allowing them a full mechanized movement phase both before and after combat, while the Soviets only move prior to combat.  In addition, if all of a German division's regiments attack or defend in the same hex, their strength is doubled by a divisional integrity bonus.<br/><br/>The German player scores victory points for the capture of cities, and for any Soviet units redirected from the Southwestern Front.  The Soviet player scores vp for recaptured cities and destroying entire German divisions (which possess several steps of strength).<br/><br/>The game includes: 1 map, counters (AH edition = 260; SPI edition = 200), 1 6-sided die, 1 Soviet reference card, 1 German reference card, 1 rules book, and 1 advanced rules insert.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "B-17 Flying Fortress Leader is a WWII strategic bombing solitaire game that takes place in the European Theater of Operations (ETO).<br/><br/>In B-17 Leader, you are in command of the Eighth Air Force stationed in England, charged with reducing Germany's ability to wage war.  Your primary mission is to destroy the Luftwaffe to ensure a successful D-Day landing, but multiple secondary missions are also required to help advance the fronts in multiple theaters.<br/><br/>You will have multiple historic Bomber Groups composed of B-17 Flying Fortresses, B-24 Liberators, and B-26 Marauders.  Optional B-29 Superfortress and B-25 Mitchell Bomber Groups are included.  Your Bomber Groups will be protected on their journey in Luftwaffe controlled airspace by Fighter Groups composed of MK VII Spitfires, P-47 Thunderbolts, P-38 Lightnings, and P-51 Mustangs.   Your groups can progress in experience levels from Newbie to Ace, but may be Reassigned as they gain experience.  Optional Renown Commanders provide groups with special skills and tactics, but could be killed during the Campaign.<br/><br/>The campaigns included in B-17 Leader include:<br/>  &bull; The Air War Begins (Aug 1942 &ndash; Dec 1942)<br/>  &bull; Operation Pointblank (June 1943 &ndash; May 1944)<br/>  &bull; Combined Bomber Operations (June 1943 &ndash; Sept 1943)<br/>  &bull; Allied Invasion (June 1944 &ndash; May 1945)<br/>  &bull; Oil Campaign (Aug 1944 &ndash; Nov 1944)<br/>  &bull; Operation Argument &ndash; Big Week (Feb 20 &ndash; 25 1944)<br/>  &bull; Operation Crossbow (Mar 1943 &ndash; May 1943)<br/>  &bull; Transportation (Apr 1944 &ndash; Aug 1944)<br/>  &bull; Strategic Targets (Jun 1943 - Aug 1943)<br/>  &bull; U-Boat Focus (Aug 1942)<br/>  &bull; Aircraft Industry Focus (Aug 1943)<br/><br/>You will be targeting many different types of targets, including Airfields, Aircraft Factories, U-Boat Pens, Ball Bearing Factories, Oil Refineries, and V-Weapon sites.  Recon Aircraft can be sent to improve your aim point and allow you to pick the optimal path to reduce Flak damage.<br/><br/>Opposing you will be Luftwaffe Squadrons, generated from multiple Aircraft Factories, that will intercept your Escorts and Bombers to and from the targets.  Luftwaffe Squadron Bandits can be BF-109s, FW-190s, BF-110s, and/or ME-410s.  Targeting their Aircraft Factories will reduce the number of new Luftwaffe Squadrons deployed each month, but destroyed factories are quickly rebuilt, and new Aircraft Factories are periodically being added.  Attacking and destroying Airfields helps reduce the number of deployed Luftwaffe Squadrons.  Victory Points are earned for each destroyed Target.<br/><br/>Various German Defense Commanders will try different tactics and technologies in an effort to stop your campaign.  Each German commander will also have a varying range of Luftwaffe responses to your attack, from Poor to All Out.<br/><br/>To help mitigate the Luftwaffe threat, you can accomplish Secondary Mission objectives that can advance the Mediterranean and Russian fronts to force Germany to send more Luftwaffe Squadrons into those theaters.  You can also purchase various technologies to increase the odds of a successful mission, like Drop Tanks, Jammers, and H2X Radar sets.  An option to invest and field the P-80 Shooting Star jet fighter is included.    Once the Allied Invasion has begun, many Secondary Missions will help advance the Allies to Berlin to end the war.<br/><br/>Your Bombers will take damage and be destroyed, but monthly Replenishment units will help bring your groups up in strength.<br/><br/>If you have played other Leader Games, many aspects of B-17 Leader will be familiar.  But due to the Strategic nature of your bombing campaign, new gameplay aspects are introduced.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Ships deals with the history of shipping, from the time of the Phoenicians to the modern era. The game is divided into three ages, marked with different ship types. The first age is that of the galley, followed by the age of the galleon, then finally the steamship age. The board combines a track showing the development of ships, similar to that in Automobile, with a map of Europe and an area representing the rest of the world.<br/><br/>Your turn is divided into two phases. In the first phase, you choose to either conduct commerce (such as selling goods, taxing locations or improving your warehouse) or take a card, selecting one from seven on display; the cards vary in their effects, granting money, victory points or special actions.<br/><br/>In the second phase, you choose whether to place a ship, move a ship, or retrieve ships/merchants. When you place a ship, you do so in either the merchant box or the warship box in one of eleven levels. A merchant allows you to place a merchant cube on the board, giving you one or two goods counters to place in your warehouse. A warship lets you take control of a location at the cost of one food goods counter.<br/><br/>Once all of your ships are on the board, you can either move them (paying money to advance its level and take the associated action) or retrieve it from the board so that you can place it elsewhere later. As ships are placed in a level, the cost of placing in the next level reduces &mdash; until finally somebody is willing to pay the cost to place in that level (which earns bonus points and possible additional income). When a ship is placed in the first galleon level, galleys become redundant; similarly, someone placing in the first steamship level makes galleons redundant. During the galleon and steamship ages, you can pay extra to move more ships, so having money in hand gives you a greater range of options and allows you to use your fleet more efficiently.<br/><br/>When placing ships, you can initially place only in &quot;1&quot; locations, which are grouped around the eastern Mediterranean Sea. Once someone pays to move to a &quot;2&quot; location, which are grouped around the western Mediterranean, that area opens to others, with the other areas being Northern Europe (3), the Americas (4), East Indies (5) and the Pacific (6). As soon as a new area opens, players score points for merchants and control discs in the present area, with the points earned being the same as the number of the area.<br/><br/>Ships includes six types of goods: food, oil, metal, wine, cloth and spices. Each has a monetary value as well as a special power. Food can be used to take control of locations, thus building an empire. Oil can be used to gain extra actions. Metal helps to advance your ships along the outer track. Wine can be converted to goods of a lower value. Cloth can be converted to victory points, while spices have the highest monetary value. You have to decide whether to cash your goods in for money or use their power.<br/><br/>NOTE: this description is out-of-date.<br/><br/>",

You attempt to stop the advance of four armies bent on destroying Parliament and Puritanism, whom you represent; simply holding on to London is not enough.<br/><br/>Each of the three English Civil Wars are replayed through the use of separate card decks that recreate the historical military and political events that could spell doom to the Parliamentarian forces. There are civil wars going on not just in England, but in Scotland and Ireland too; and each will have varying impact on the play of the game at different times.<br/><br/>The title comes from the purported response to the beheading of King Charles by his implacable foe, Oliver Cromwell, who remarked that this act of regicide was a &ldquo;cruel necessity.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Note: Cruel Necessity is our first Gold Banner wargame to exclude a mounted map inside. Because of all the gameplay real estate in Cruel Necessity, mounting the boards using our print-on-demand publishing model would have raised the Retail Price to $55.00 (i.e., a $15 increase), and that just seemed like too much. We hope our vaunted wargame customers can soldier on with our sturdy paper maps as the great wargames of yore have long provided.<br/><br/>What's in the box:<br/><br/>&bull; One full color 22-page Rulebook (Designer's Notes included)<br/>&bull; One 22&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; paper game map (in two sections)<br/>&bull; One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; Battle Display Mat<br/>&bull; 75 cards<br/>&bull; 98 thick, two-sided, multi-shaped game pieces<br/>&bull; One 2-sided player aid<br/>&bull; One blue (Parliamentary) 6-sided die<br/>&bull; One red (Royalist) 6-sided die<br/>&bull; One bright red, 9&quot; x 11 7/8&quot; Deluxe cardboard VPG game box<br/>&bull; One beautiful box cover sleeve<br/>&bull; One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin<br/>&bull; One charcoal desiccant packet<br/><br/>",

Although many players may find a natural end point to their game at the conclusion of the story, players can continue to play the game for as long as they would like over as many game sessions as they wish. As players progress through the game, their town will develop and grow, reacting to changing seasons and to the members of the community over time.

        "description": "How did Rome get to be Rome? Why did the Glory That Was Greece fade? What stopped Carthage from making an empire of the Mediterranean? Could the Seleucids really have conquered the western world?<br/><br/>PAX ROMANA covers Europe from 300 BC through the end of the 1st century BC, when control of the Mediterranean was in a state of flux with four empires possible. The emphasis is on strategic operations, from raising armies to colonizing outlying areas, to fighting barbarian incursions, to maintaining political stability at home. <br/>PAX uses a unique marker-oriented play sequence that provides surprise and opportunity, plus a deck of unusual cards that provide the historical background of events and calamities within which the players must operate.<br/><br/>PAX provides wide variety of scenarios, from fast-playing, one-sitting two-player games to vivid recreations of the entire era with four players. The game works well with 2, 3 or 4 players, and is designed to be playable solitaire for those interested in the historical view it provides. Scenarios range from The Punic Wars, through the Eastern Med conflicts between the Greeks and the Seleucids, all the way up to the entire 10 turn game, covering 300 years of history. In addition, there are two versions of PAX: the Standard Game, designed for fast play, and the Advanced version, which adds in much tangential history and allows for a more introspective examination of the era.<br/><br/>PAX ROMANA includes one gamemap, 55 cards, 400+ counters, and a host of play aids and charts to keep things organized.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bum&uacute;nt&uacute; is a lightweight strategy game based on the culture and folklore of the Bakongo tribes. Descendants of the Kingdom of Kongo, the Bakongo people are the largest group of tribespeople in central Africa.<br/><br/>A common theme in African folklore is that animals are wise creatures who teach humans to do good and moral things. As a tribal leader, you will follow the guidance of the animals, journeying through the jungle in hopes of winning their favor.<br/><br/>Players start on a board full of African animals, each with their own movement abilities. Each player can either move as normal or follow the wisdom of the animals, earning that animal's favor in the process and collecting its chip. Some animals will make movement easier, while others can affect how opponents move, giving a lot of depth to this deceivingly simple strategy game. As the game progresses, fewer and fewer animals remain, making choices that much more important.<br/><br/>Once all the Advancement chips have been collected, each animal will offer a different amount of favor based on how far up they are on the Favor Leaderboard, something that players can affect throughout the game. Bonus points will be given for collecting Nkisi (small statues) and Yowa (spiritual symbols). At the end of the game, the leader who has accumulated the most favor wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Legacy: Gears of Time is a strategic card game, mechanically rooted in its time travel theme. Players each play cards from their own hand, draw from a central draw pile, move and play technologies on a single timeline, while placing their influence cubes on existing technologies.<br/><br/>Legacy is played on a timeline that grows at the end of each of 4 rounds. Players take turns during a round consisting of 3 actions each. During each turn, you may travel back in time, play a technology card from your hand, influence an existing technology, or draw two cards (keeping only one).<br/><br/>As you travel back in time, Technologies are played from your hand by paying their discard cost. Any technologies you play generate influence for you automatically.<br/><br/>Having more influence than your opponents is the key to claiming rewards for a technology! At the end of each round, rewards are given for each technology and its dependencies. One Influence cube from each technology will come off at the end of each round, forming your influence pool to be used in future rounds to influence existing technologies. Keep in mind, a technology is only considered successful if all of its dependencies exist previously on the timeline.<br/><br/>Since there are several copies of each technology, you may be able to preempt and eliminate an existing copy by playing yours earlier in the timeline!  Be sure there is room for your new technology, though; each time-frame has a capacity equal to it's distance from the present.<br/><br/>There are also a few rare but powerful Fate cards, each allowing you to break the rules in interesting ways. Fate cards have no discard cost and don't require an action to be played.<br/><br/>By strategically influencing existing technologies, adapting to your opponents actions, and carefully choosing when to go further back in time, you will find yourself victorious over your rivals! History remains intact until the Ancient Machine demands you return to the past to rebuild history, and your Legacy, once more.<br/><br/>Summary:<br/><br/>     4 Rounds<br/>     4 Turns per Round<br/>     3 Actions per Turn (any mix of the following):<br/>         Travel back in Time<br/>         Play a Technology card<br/>         Influence an existing Technology<br/>         Draw two cards (keep one)<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dinosaurs reside on the modular hexagons of the super-continent Pangaea. Each hex can only support a certain number of animals. Not only that, the continent is splitting up with parts of the land disappearing and new lands emerging elsewhere.  Players try to disperse as widely as is wise while still dominating each continent where they exist. The game ends as the meteorite strikes, ending the age of the great dinosaurs.<br/><br/>Players begin by placing herds of their dinosaurs on the single continent of Pangea, made from tiles of various terrain types. They then take turns, which comprise of drifting tiles, conducting optional actions, and finally resolving any of their own tribes that have been left in water or on overpopulated tiles. The first phase, the drift, involves a player moving a landscape tile of the same type as depicted on the card they play. The tile must be moved further away from the South Pole (the centre of Pangea) than it already is, must remain a part of the same continent and must be attached to a continent with that player's herds. Players have 4 action points to spend on other optional actions, including another drift, migrating herds, rescuing swimming herds and reproducing to create more herds.<br/><br/>Points are scored during the game whenever a new separate continent is formed as a result of a landscape tile drift, as well as at the end of the game for each continent. During the game, the player with the most herds on the new continent scores 2 points, while the player with the second-most scores 1. End-game scoring is much more significant, as the player with the most herds gains 1 point per landscape tile on the continent, and the player with the second most scores half that amount.<br/><br/>The final round begins when the meteor strike card is drawn, and the game then ends. After final scoring is completed, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>Premiere: Essen 2002<br/><br/>",

The other players take the role of starship crew. Players first build a ship with various tiles, with each tile representing a different location on a ship, such as a bridge, engine room, torpedo room, teleporter room, etc. Players can go to the appropriate room to take the designated action. At the same time, the game is played on a second board representing the space around the ship. The game is played in scenarios. The goal of the game is to complete the scenario specific mission. The crew will win, as a team, if the scenario goals are accomplished.<br/><br/>",

Those who survive the finale win the game!<br/><br/>It won't be easy. After every round of player turns, the NPC killer, Otis, stalks the closest targets around the board, attacking whenever he gets the chance. Unarmed players PANIC, are injured and forced to run away. Those lucky enough to have found protection are able to fight Otis with a dice roll. Better  weapons mean higher value dice and a greater chance of success. Beat Otis and he disappears form the board until re-emerging from the woods on his next turn.<br/><br/>Be warned, as the body count rises, Otis gains strength, moves faster and becomes more deadly. Just when you think you're safe, you may find him waiting right in front of you!<br/><br/>If that's not bad enough, players must draw Cabin Cards which have a wide variety of game changing effects, both positive and negative. They contain Plot Twists, Cameos, weather changes, special Otis cards, clever Campers, helpful Weapons and Items, and fate tempting &quot;foolin' around&quot; cards.<br/><br/>The Counselors won't give up so easily. In addition to their own inherent talents, Survival Cards grant the players unique abilities and tactics to help elude or confront the killer.<br/><br/>Who, if anyone, will survive?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Black Gold is a reimplementation of Giganten, with the additions of support for a 5th player (with special rules involving additional auctions), several official variants in the rulebook, a modular board, two new special actions, and a different deck balance.<br/><br/>Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>The year is 1922 and the Texas Oil Boom is in full swing. Prepare to head West, surveying the Permian Basin for profitable gushers and gaining more wealth than your fellow prospectors. Are you part of a burgeoning oil family fixed on becoming a dynasty, or a shrewd yankee, tired of watching southerners making their fortune? Whatever your reasons, join the race to become the wealthiest son of a gun in West Texas.<br/><br/>Black Gold is a board game of drilling and discovery for 2-5 prospectors, and play can last from 1-2 hours. Competitors attempt to claim the best wells, bid wisely against their neighbors, and sell their oil at the highest price in order to finish the game with the most money when the Oil Baron&rsquo;s train reaches the last track.<br/><br/>To secure wealth, players explore the terrain of the provided map tiles for oil wells, and they survey and build their derricks. Map tiles are double-sided and modular, ensuring a unique experience every time. Money is made if a player can transport his oil to one of three oil companies, and win the right to sell at auction. The Oil Baron's train moves nearer every turn, counting down the rounds of the game's thrilling ride; all the while it begs you and your fellow prospectors to ask the question: Am I making enough money?<br/><br/>The landscape of the Texas Oil business can be fickle and lonely as it is arid. Players can strategize against their opponents, and upset their play through special actions. During auctions, players can even lie about the value of their Sales Licenses in order to force their neighbors to bid more! But careful, you future tycoons &ndash; if you're caught bluffing, you're penalized.<br/><br/>Although Black Gold is a satisfying bidding game, it is also an exciting contest of strategy and exploration. Every game variable can offer an advantage or variation in play each round. The round's starting player has the first choice for powerful Action cards, which dictate his options for that round. Subsequent prospectors can be savvy and alter their exploration based on other players' surveying, or the last player could choose to sell his oil at a different company than his neighbors and find an easier auction at which to bid.<br/><br/>Black Gold is easy to learn, but offers an abundance of intriguing game play choices. Black Gold also provides players with optional rules that can shorten or extend game play, increase the challenge, give inexperienced players a handicap, or even reduce the randomness of well distribution. With all of these options players will discover that Black Gold is a new experience every time, even offering unique variation depending on player number, map tile setup, and well placement.<br/><br/>",

For even above the clouds, there is still room for improvement...<br/><br/>Noria is the debut title from Sophia Wagner, winner of the Spiel des Jahres fellowship in 2015. The talented, young author created an entirely new steampunk universe specifically for this game, and artists Michael Menzel and Klemens Franz have managed to bring her vision to life. At the center of the game is an innovative mechanism called &quot;wheel building&quot;. Each player has an action wheel consisting of three rings, with slots for a number of different action discs. Over the course of the game, players try to obtain new discs and manipulate the rings of the wheel to optimize their action selection. Additionally, to ensure their investments bear fruit, they also need to bribe politicians with knowledge.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The future of humanity awaits you in Space Gate Odyssey. A system of viable exoplanets has been recently discovered and the Confederations are flocking into space to colonize it. In this 2 to 4-player development and flow-management board game, you play the leader of one of these Confederations and play your influence in the Odyssey command station to send as many of your settlers as you can on these exoplanets.<br/><br/>After decades of research and technological development, humanity is preparing to leave the Earth to colonize this discovered system. To get there, only one possible means of transport exists: space gates. For reasons related to physics and other quantum aspects, these gates can be built only in space. The Confederations have therefore embarked on the construction of their own station in orbit, equipped with space gates.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the colonizing era, these portals make it possible to go on one of the first three discovered planets. As soon as an entire contingent of settlers has joined the gate of a space station, it is teleported to the corresponding exoplanet. The landing conditions vary according to the planets and the choice of colonized spots quickly becomes strategic.<br/><br/>As soon as one of the three exoplanets is fully colonized, each Confederation gains influence according to its placement, then access to one of the two later discovered exoplanets becomes possible. At the end of the colonization of the five exoplanets, the stations are teleported to the Hawking planet and the influence of each Confederation is assessed. The leader of the most influential Confederation will be promoted to the rank of Governor of this new system.<br/><br/>One of the biggest challenges in Space Gate Odyssey is your ability to quickly develop and intelligently arrange your space station. The better you optimize the flow of your settlers to your station, then to the exoplanets, the more of them you can send to the favorable spots and thus gain influence.<br/><br/>The choice of the modules, their arrangement, and the distance between the airlocks and the gates are therefore essential elements &mdash; especially since, at the end of the game, the domains of the modules you used to build your station will bring you additional influence points if they are in line with the position of the domains on the Hawking planet Predominance.<br/><br/>Finally, you must be careful not to leave too many open corridors on the space void as this represents a real danger for your settlers and could therefore damage your reputation.<br/><br/>Your most amazing quest starts with Space Gate Odyssey. Will you be able to take over your opponents in order to take control of the new system, or will you stay at the dock?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Put on your captain's hat and navigate the 3D pirate ship using sand timers in this unique real-time cooperative game.<br/><br/>As a member of an adventurous pirate crew, your goal is to be crowned Admiral of the Black, the most feared pirate ship in the Caribbean. To earn this title, you must complete dangerous scenarios in the shortest possible time frame. The most innovative element of the game is that the player uses their own 30-second sand timer as a character to be placed on the ship to perform actions. Each time a player places their own sand timer, they have to wait for the sand to run out to be able to perform the action needed. Each hole in the ship represents an area where you can perform a specific action: turning the ship, loading cannons, shooting enemy ships, repairing damage, and so forth...<br/><br/>A Tale of Pirates (previously announced as Admiral of the Black) has ten different scenarios, ranging from ordinary pirating activities like looking and shooting, to kraken-hunting, prison breaks, treasure hunts, and much more. An app for any smartphone or tablet will lead the players along the missions, assist with scenario data, random events, multiple paths, upgrades, and gamestate-saving for later sessions. It also serves as a timer for the individual round as the typical scenario lasts 2-3 rounds, each five minutes long.<br/><br/>The players have to react to events and maneuver the ship to fight enemy gunboats, catch rich merchant vessels, and avoid other obstacles. They must communicate to agree and organize things to do, but they have to be quick because time is always ticking.<br/><br/>A Tale of Pirates is swift playing with simple rules, but it's exciting and involving, with great interactions among players. Unlike some other real time coop games the stress is present but not dominating. The thirty-second delays, in addition to the intermittent rounds, always allow you to catch your breath!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Red Winter:  The Soviet Attack at Tolvaj&auml;rvi, Finland, December 8-12, 1939<br/><br/>It is the winter of 1939 and the Soviet Union has just declared war on Finland.  Bombers unleash a downpour of destruction on the Finnish capital of Helsinki. In the David and Goliath struggle that follows, the Russians swarm across the border and push back the Finns in victory after victory. The future appears grim for Finnish independence.<br/><br/>Nowhere is the danger greater than in the central sector, where a Russian breakthrough would threaten the strongpoints of the Mannerheim Line. Newly assigned to the sector, the Finnish Colonel Paavo Talvela  surveys the terrain and chooses the place to make a stand: a lake called Tolvaj&auml;rvi.  The weary and demoralized Finnish ski troops have mere hours to recover a semblance of order before the Russian juggernaut smashes into them yet again. Over the next five days, the world watches in awe as the Finns manage to halt the Russian advance through sheer heroic determination.  Then, miraculously, the Finns launch a successful counterattack...<br/><br/>Red Winter is a two player historical game which simulates the unusual battle at Tolvaj&auml;rvi at a rarely gamed scale: company sized combat units and 90 minute game turns.  Players assume the roles of the Russian and Finnish commanders, controlling the actions of Finnish ski infantry, Russian heavy machine gun companies, mortars, tanks, anti-tank guns, and other combat units. A desperate battle for territory and survival is about to be waged across a bleak and snowy landscape of forests, swamps, and frozen lakes.<br/><br/>The game utilizes many tried-and-true &quot;classic&quot; wargame mechanics in combination with novel and well-integrated systems for ranged attacks, unit recovery, Finnish night raids, attrition losses from sub-zero weather conditions, and more.  The design focuses foremost on playability, with low counter  density, concise rules, and sleek, simple mechanics that combine to allow each player the luxury of completing his turn in about five minutes.  This means the full 40 turn campaign game is playable in a single afternoon.  The large 5/8 inch counters and oversized hexes further increase playability.  And the illustrated examples make it easy to jump right into the action.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 90 Minute Game Turns <br/>MAP SCALE:  425 yards per hex <br/>UNIT SCALE: mostly companies; some sections and platoons <br/>PLAYERS: 1-2 <br/>COMPLEXITY: Moderate<br/>Playing Time: 20 minutes to 12 hours, depending on scenario<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the 18th and 19th centuries, shipping companies aimed to strengthen the trade between the West and the Far East that had begun in previous centuries. Tea, spices, coffee, and silk are commodities much consumed in Europe, and their buying and selling prices depend closely on supply and demand. Fortunes can be made and gambled depending on circumstances.<br/><br/>In East India Companies, players manage a large shipping company that trades with far flung trading posts in India. They must manage their ships and invest in buying shares of their own company or those of their competitors. Most importantly, players have to keep an eye on the constantly fluctuating market prices! Is it better to invest your money in the stock market or in buying goods? Do they prefer to use fast ships with low tonnage or slower ships with larger holds? Whatever the players choose, their strategies will influence those of their opponents.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the mountain there are veins of precious stones. The players build tunnels in the mountain, establish stations in the mountain and in the city, discover veins of precious stones, acquire precious stones, and sell them. The players get points for stations in the city and for selling precious stones. The winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>The board is a hex grid, with city spaces along most of the edges. The center hex is a vein of yellow gems: place all 9 in a stack there. The rest of the gems go in their individual market areas (priced 1-9 based on supply).Each round (3 in game), add 5 contracts (showing gem combinations; score big VP if completing them; lose some VP if cannot) to the display. Then auction (using VP) turn order chips 1-4. Players then each get the same set of tiles (hexes with various numbers of track exits, prospecting tiles, veins, option tiles, etc.) plus a dynamite hex based on their turn order chip. Take turns taking contracts until everyone passes.<br/><br/>Then, on your turn, play 1-4 of your 12 actions. These allow you to place tracks (expanding previous tunnels; you can also cover track tiles with tiles having more exits), stations, or veins (which you supply with gems of your choice). Gems (6 types, 9 tokens each) each have their own market where they are stored and which set their max sell price. The last action is prospecting, where you create a path from one of your stations to another, passing through as many veins as possible: take one gem from each vein.<br/><br/>After everyone's 12 actions are used, any exposed dynamite tracks explode and take the adjacent tracks as well (all these are placed in the Buy Pool, which can be accessed by turning in Option tiles)! You score for stations in cities based on the number of empty hexes. Then, for each gem type, players bid (Dutch auction style, bidding for the lowest price they'll accept) and may sell their gems for VP at their bid price.<br/><br/>At game end (after 3 rounds), players sell off all their remaining gems (with lowest VP selling next gem), there's another city scoring, and players lose VP for incomplete orders. Most VP wins!<br/><br/>",

From that point on, you get to decide where to travel, when to battle, when to negotiate, and when to seek out divine prophesies to guide your actions.<br/><br/>You are supplied with soldiers and advisers to help you navigate the dangers of the battlefield and the negotiating table. These include Infantry, Archers, Phalanxes, Cavalry, Advisers, Scholars, Courtesans, and Spies. You will craftily combine these resources with your own plans to achieve victory, and glorification. And if you do well, you will be remembered as one of the greatest leaders ever to walk the earth.<br/><br/>The life of Alexander is divided into several campaigns, each spanning several years. During each campaign, you are given goals, but how you achieve those goals is up to you. Do you enter into battle? Or negotiate? How strong are you? How strong are they? What can you gain? These are all decisions you get to make, and must make well, if you are to live up to the immortal standards set before you.<br/><br/>The campaigns can either be played stand alone, or linked to play through his entire life.

        "description": "Cataclysm: A Second World War<br/><br/>It is the 1930s and the world is still recovering from the Great War and the Great Depression that followed it. A second world war can break out at any time. Can you stop it? Will you start it? Better yet, can you win it?<br/><br/>Cataclysm&nbsp;is not your typical game about World War II. The game begins in 1933, not 1939, and is global in scope. Germany is far from dominating Europe. Japan is on the march in Asia. Every crisis is an unexpected opportunity. There is no hindsight and anything can happen.<br/><br/>Truly grand strategic in scope,&nbsp;Cataclysm&nbsp;requires players to lead nations, not just armies or fleets. You must craft a diplomatic strategy, develop political support for your policies at home, shift your economy to a war footing, and build up the forces you need to deter or vanquish your enemies.<br/><br/>There is no traditional I-go-you-go turn structure in Cataclysm. Counters representing political actions, military actions, units, and possible events are drawn at random from an action cup. As each counter comes out, the owning player resolves it, and play swiftly moves on to the next draw. You have to make plans to execute when your chance comes up, but you have no idea when, or in what order, events will transpire.<br/><br/>A game about global war gives every nation armies, air forces, and fleets. But in&nbsp;Cataclysm, military pieces have no numeric values. You know what forces you have and where they are deployed. To resolve combat, each side rolls up to three dice and compares their single highest die.&nbsp;You can devote more resources to a campaign (generating more dice or bonuses), but that does not guarantee a favorable outcome. Your efforts can lead to triumph&hellip; or to disaster.<br/><br/>In&nbsp;Cataclysm, you are free to explore alternatives. The Soviets can construct a massive long-range bomber force. Japan can build powerful armored forces to overrun Siberia. Germany can invade Britain, or France can take Berlin, provided you craft a strategy that gets you there.<br/><br/>When you play Cataclysm, you write your own history of a second world war.<br/><br/>&quot;This is my most anticipated wargame of 2018.&quot; --Ananda Gupta, co-designer of Twilight Struggle.<br/><br/>&quot;I WOULD EAT A KITTEN FOR THIS GAME&quot; --Kuhrusty<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Precursor of the Mutant Chronicles miniatures Game and a kissing cousin of Heroquest stands Mutant Chronicles: The Siege of the Citadel<br/><br/>Setting: In Mutant Chronicles, players control one of five corporations: Imperial, Cybertronic, Mishima, Capitol, or Bauhaus. Each player begins with two of their own unique Doomtroopers imbued their Corporation's special ability.  They make decisions and plan strategies to prevent the Dark Legion and its leader, the vile Nepharite, Alakhai, from conquering the solar system. Each successful mission brings a new one with the modular Citadel and events that can help or hinder you in battle. Each promotion gives credits to access more powerful weaponry!  Grab a Punisher Shortsword and Plasma Carbine to make your mark in the Mutant Chronicles!<br/><br/>Gameplay:  The game begins by choosing which of the 5 players will be the Dark Legion Player for the current mission.  A player fulfills this role by setting their Doomtroopers aside for the current mission and controlling the enemies.  The Dark Legion player can earn promotion points for their inactive Doomtroopers by wounding the other player's Doomtroopers.  Thus, taking a turn as the baddies is not totally thankless.  10 different scenarios are included with the game.<br/><br/>The Corporation players take their Player tray and 2 Doomtrooper miniatures, two Doomtrooper cards and a Secondary Mission card if specified by mission (these allow extra points if the requirements of the card can be met).  The Dark Legion Player sets up the current mission's Citadel layout with the modular boards and gathers his mission specified Force Cards.  The Force cards are deployed in rooms face-down and are revealed when a Doomtrooper enters and the corresponding Dark Legion miniatures are placed on board.  All miniatures may move 3 squares per move action and most figures get 2 actions per turn.  A figure can do one of the following: Move then Attack, Attack then Move, Attack twice or Move twice.  Corporation Players go first.  Order is determined by flipping over a face-down Corporation token.  The revealed player (Doomtrooper or Legion) takes their turn  and the next Corporation token is flipped.<br/><br/>Play is semi-cooperative for the Corporation players as they compete for points, but want the overall mission to succeed.   The weapon card the Doomtrooper has equipped determines whether he can attack long range, close combat or both.  There are various miscellaneous equipment that can be equipped in addition to the weapon (healing kits, laser targeting, Grenade launcher etc...).  Attacks are carried out by rolling dice and comparing the number of hits to the armor value of the target.  If the number of hits exceeds the armor value of the creature it is eliminated.  In addition Doomtroopers can use a Doomtrooper card to affect the game in some way.  These cards list two effects but only one can be used per card and are then discarded.  The possible effects range from modification of combat or movement to messing with your opponents (jamming their gun for example).<br/><br/>The Dark Legion(DL) Player at the start of his turn draws the top event card, reads it out loud and follows the instructions.  The DL player then receives the reinforcements listed on the card and places them on the board.  The DL player then looks to see if any Force cards are still face-down. If there are, the player reveals one and places the revealed units in the same room the card was in.  The DL player then takes his actions with all of his creatures.  Play continues in this way until mission is successful or the time runs out and it fails.<br/><br/>Game End: Successful Doomtroopers receive promotion points for the creatures killed in battle and credits specified for the mission.  If they gain rank Doomtroopers improve the combat dice they use and gain extra actions.  With their credits Doomtroopers can purchase improved weaponry and gadgets (Gehenna Puker, Nimrod Autocannon).  The Dark Legion player's inactive Doomtroopers gain 1 promotion point per point of damage inflicted upon the opposing players' Doomtroopers by creatures.<br/><br/>A rare poster-magazine called &quot;Sinkadus&quot; 41# &amp; 42# that was produced by Target Games AB only in Sweden, added an expansion to Siege of the Citadel.  It added to the base game Brotherhood Characters (Inquisitor Nicodemus and Mortificator Sebastian Crenshaw), new equipment, spells, and two new baddies: the Pretorian Stalkers. All the minis were given their own stats and paper models for representation.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Votes for Women is a card-driven game covering the American women's suffrage movement from 1848-1920, culminating with the ratification (or rejection) of the Nineteenth Amendment. The game provides competitive, co-operative and solitaire play, with co-operative and solitaire play against the &quot;Oppobot.&quot;<br/><br/>To win, the Suffragist player must have Congress pass the proposed Amendment and then have three-fourths of the states (36 of the then 48 states) ratify the Amendment. The Opposition player wins by either preventing Congress from passing the proposed Amendment or by having 13 states reject the Amendment.<br/><br/>The game lasts for six turns - a turn consisting of drawing cards from the players' own decks, bidding on strategy cards, and then six rounds of card play where a player may play a card for an event or discard a card to campaign, organize or lobby Congress.  If Congress has proposed the Amendment but neither 36 states have ratified nor 13 states have rejected, then the game goes to Final Voting.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warhammer 40,000 is a table-top miniature-based war game set in a dystopian future. Although usually played by two players, theoretically any number of players can participate at once.<br/><br/>Players can choose one of a number of factions from within the Warhammer 40,000 universe - examples include, humanity's defenders, the Space Marines and Imperial Guard, the nearly extinct race of Eldar, the all-consuming Tyranids or the corrupted once-human forces of Chaos. Each race also how their own sub-groups and flavours - for example there are Chapters of Space Marines with their own specialisations, whilst a Chaos army that worships the war-god Khorne would look very different to one worshiping the pleasure god Slaanesh.<br/><br/>Players select their armies based on the miniatures they own. To ensure balance each miniature is assigned a points value (with the value rising for optional upgrades) and players usually agree a points limit for each army before play. Similarly, players will agree the rules and victory conditions for a specific scenario.<br/><br/>Each turn proceeds in phases covering movement, melee combat, ranged combat and so forth. No game board is used, players make or purchase their own scenery. Physical measurement is used to determine movement and weapon range, with dice used to calculate everything from damage to morale and the effectiveness of physic powers. Special 'scatter dice' are used to calculate random or quasi-random events such as the movement of a gas cloud or fire.<br/><br/>Games usually last for a specified number of turns, after which the player who has accumulated the most victory points (by achieving pre-set goals and destroying enemy miniatures) is the winner.<br/><br/>Expansions and new armies are regularly released for Warhammer 40,000, with new editions of the game itself being released roughly every four years.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Quodd Heroes is a fast-paced modular, scenario-based adventure board game that plays like a combination of Super Smash Bros., Mario Kart and Legend of Zelda all wrapped into one. Whether it&rsquo;s a simple point-to-point rally-style race, capture the flag or a quest to uncover hidden secrets each game is filled with unexpected events, lots of player interaction, ever-changing boards and a dash of mayhem.<br/><br/>The core mechanism in Quodd Heroes is something you&rsquo;ve never seen before. Each player controls a different cube-shaped character miniature and player board.  You then assign a different movement skill to five of the six sides of your character (the sixth side has an ability unique to your character). When you begin the movement phase on your turn you &ldquo;tumble&rdquo; your character into an adjacent space and perform the movement skill associated with the face-up side of your character. Skills include: Tumble, Jump, Slide, Diagonal Slide, and Dash.<br/><br/>While you work to complete the scenario&rsquo;s objective(s), either on your own, cooperatively, or against other players, game boards which are laid out in grids present obstacles like walls, raging rivers, chasms, moving platforms, rotating board sections, trap doors, tunnels, teleporters and more. As you navigate the world you create new obstacles and shortcuts while battling your opponents by pushing them into pits, blocking their paths and fouling their plans.<br/><br/>As you explore the world you will find food, runes, items and pets in the form of cards. These cards enhance your abilities, slow your opponents and modify the world around you. If you use your movement skills and cards strategically you'll emerge as the greatest of the Quodd Heroes.<br/><br/>Player Turn Structure:<br/><br/>1. Play cards (power up): Play as many cards as you like from your hand. Power up and alter the board prior to movement.<br/><br/>2. Movement Phase: Perform your natural tumble by turning your hero miniature over into an adjacent space, activate any board elements on that space, then activate the movement skill associated with the side of your character that is now facing up. Move up to your maximum distance with that skill in any direction you like.<br/><br/>3. Play card (recover phase): You many play any additional cards you like during this phase.<br/><br/>4. Exploration phase: draw cards from the lineup of cards or the top of the deck equal to your exploration value<br/><br/>At the end of each round an upkeep phase includes:<br/><br/>- moving board elements and animals<br/>- play a world event card that effects all players<br/>- Adjust round tracker (in timed scenarios)<br/>- all heroes upgrade their hero by selecting an upgrade tile and placing it in their upgrade track.<br/>- First player mark passes to the left<br/><br/>",

You'll place a mix of tiles to help grow the thriving city. The best design wins the game!<br/><br/>Shake That City is a family puzzly tile-laying game for 1-4 players, that plays under an hour! The game is played over a series of rounds. The active player shakes the Cube Shaker and presses its slider to reveal a 3x3 pattern, based on which they need to place the corresponding building tiles of a single color of their choice on their board. The building tiles correspond to roads, factories, shops, parks and of course, homes. The other players then pick any building color other than the one the active player picked, then place matching colored tiles in the matching pattern on their board. Players earn points for tile-placement combinations and for the completed bonus point tiles around the edge of their board.<br/><br/>&bull; Roads wants to connect to an edge of the board.<br/>&bull; Factories wants to be next to other factories and roads.<br/>&bull; Homes want to be placed in clusters that are as small as possible &mdash; the smallest being a single tile &mdash; so long as they're not next to a factory.<br/>&bull; Parks wants to be next to homes and factories.<br/>&bull; Shops score increasingly more the closer they are placed to the city center, but if they're not placed on an edge, they need to be adjacent to a road connected to the board's edge in order to score.

But how does one control creatures whose existence defies all logic?<br/><br/>Nightfall: Martial Law is a stand-alone game that can be integrated with the hit competitive deck-building game Nightfall. Martial Law brings you a complete new set of cards with special powers, and features all-new vampires, werewolves, hunters and ghouls. Martial Law also introduces the feeding mechanism: Feed your chained orders to give them greater effect!<br/><br/>Each card has a main color and two linking colors. If you can match the main color of a card to one of the linking colors of the previous card, you can chain those cards together. Once a chain is started, players all get an opportunity to link additional cards onto the chain during that turn.<br/><br/>Cards in the chain resolve in reverse order: first in, last out. Instant effects fire off as cards come off the chain, doing damage to your opponents or bringing characters into play to defend you and attack your opponents.<br/><br/>The object of Nightfall is to put wounds into your opponents&rsquo; decks and end the game with the least amount of wounds in your deck. But beware: the more wounds a person has, the more enraged they become and the faster their deck works, meaning more cards and bigger chains will come your way!<br/><br/>",

Armed with kinfire lanterns, you&rsquo;ll brave the Starless Nights, battle the creatures that emerge, and guard each others&rsquo; backs against the malevolent forces trying to stop you.<br/><br/>Each quest has three phases: adventuring, battle, and exploration. In the adventuring phase, players make choices based on options presented on the quest cards and need to accomplish something (such as crossing a river or chasing down a suspect) by flipping the correct number and color of cards from their decks. In the battle phase, players work together to defeat enemies on a physical battle map. Turns are determined by drawing chits out of the destiny bag, with each enemy having numbered tokens that correspond with different attacks and actions. Players may play action cards on their own turns to do damage and can play boost cards on other players' turns to do things like reduce damage, move players, or even return a drawn chit to the destiny bag for redraw. The game doesn't end if an objective isn't achieved or an enemy defeats the heroes, but it will affect later gameplay and choice options. Lastly, on certain quests players can return to the city in the exploration phase to speak to NPCs, purchase items, and level up their decks.<br/><br/>Woven throughout each of these phases are cards that require you to make a choice, such as resting before moving on or charging into battle, or whether or not to spare someone's life. The characters in the game have their own set of morals and standards, and playing according to your character can earn you Kinfire tokens that help you level up. Ultimately though, the decisions you make are yours alone.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The captain has rounded you all up because you're all lazy and stupid and simply not worth the rum and loot you get paid. That said, the captain has decided he's willing to keep two of you in his crew. To prove you're worthy, you will fight amongst yourselves, trying to shove other players' pirates off the end of the plank while keeping yours alive!<br/><br/>In game terms, each round players secretly stack three of their ten action cards, then they take turns revealing and playing those actions one by one no matter what's gone wrong between the planning and the doing. If you plan to have a pirate shove someone off the plank on your third move and all he sees are his own best mates, he will still shove away! Some cards bear a skull on them, and these powerful cards must remain on the table the round after they're played, but otherwise players then pick up their action cards and start a new round. As soon as two or fewer pirates remain on board, the game ends and the owner (or owners) of these pirates win! Watch out, though, as sometimes every pirate will end up in the drink, which means that no one wins other than the sharks circling in the water below...<br/><br/>",

What remains are fragmented citystates like New Dawn City, struggling to keep chaos at bay. The sinister Syndicate targets these weakened cities for domination by usurping, organizing, and enhancing the existing criminal elements. In the world of In Too Deep, you are part of a secret agency dedicated to stopping the Syndicate at all costs.<br/><br/>Cybernetic implants give Syndicate operatives a technological advantage, but you have found a way to exploit that power. By infiltrating their cerebral upgrades, you can gain control of these criminals. Going deep undercover into the minds of your targets, you&rsquo;ll coordinate crimes of escalating seriousness to get your hands on the critical evidence needed to foil the Syndicate&rsquo;s looming plot.<br/><br/>Each turn, you can hook into a new criminal and manipulate their activities throughout the city, accessing powerful skills and increased stamina as you grow familiar with their minds. Your physical body is in a secret lab far from the actual action, but you are by no means safe. Entering the mind of criminals takes its toll on your morality.<br/><br/>Orchestrate crimes, strive to put the information you gather to the best use, wrestle with dangerously corrupting dilemmas, and try to hold yourself together.

        "description": "Lincoln is a fast-paced, light, two-player, card-driven strategic level board-wargame set in the American Civil War that allows you to re-fight the entire American Civil War in under two hours.<br/><br/>Game play uses point-to-point movement and area control, hidden army strengths, and decks of cards providing the command choices and luck; there are no dice. The Union and Confederate players each have their own card decks, reflecting the relative strengths and weaknesses of both sides. The Union player must do all the running to win the game by the time they have cycled through the Union card deck for the third time, having accumulated the required amount of victory points by capturing Confederate controlled areas, as well as squeezing the Confederate player with a naval blockade. The Confederate player must hold on and thwart the North's victory ambitions to win!<br/><br/>Each time the decks are cycled, the Union player adds some better quality cards, becoming stronger as the game progresses, where as the Confederate player adds lower quality cards, becoming weaker. The underlying game mechanism is one of &quot;deck destruction&quot; rather than the more normal deck-building.<br/><br/>Cards have multiple uses and can be recycled if used one way but during the course of the game you have to decide which cards are going to be permanently sacrificed from your deck cycle to allow you to build units.<br/><br/>",

Disguised by a secret identity, they try to kidnap the Elder of the opposing clan or give their lives for the benefit of their own Elder. Malicious attacks, aimed indiscretions, and assistance from others will slowly uncover the truth: Who fights for whom? And who is the Elder?<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player knows three things:<br/><br/><br/>    Who they are and to which clan they belong<br/>    That a few other players are allies, while everyone else is the enemy of both themselves and their clan<br/>    The clan to which one of their neighbors belongs &ndash; although some characters can lie about their clan identity<br/><br/><br/>Now the players have to figure out who the Elder of the opposing team is (if there is one) and capture him. To do this, players need to attack, negotiate and deduce, with an attacked player being required to reveal information, such as his rank or clan affiliation. Each player has an ability unique to his character, and this ability can be used only at the moment that he reveals his rank. The Assassin forces players to suffer wounds, for example, while the Guardian protects a player of the character's choice.<br/><br/>In the end, if you capture your rival clan's Elder, you win &ndash; but if you capture the wrong vampire, you've fallen into the enemy's trap and lose the game.<br/><br/>",

This  wargame can be played as a campaign, with new planes becoming available as time passes, and with surviving pilots getting better at what they do.<br/><br/>Each plane has a maneuver sheet showing which ones it is allowed to do -- some maneuvers can only be executed by ace pilots, and other maneuvers are &quot;restricted&quot; in the sense that they can't be repeated from one turn to the next (the plane would stall).<br/><br/>If you &quot;tail&quot; another plane, its pilot must show you whether he's going right, left or straight ahead. You get to shoot ahead of your plane, unless you have a bomber with an observer/gunner in the back (swivel-mounted guns). Damage is rolled on a table that determines severity in terms of blue and red hits; you then draw the indicated number of coloued chits from a cup. Hits are taken to the wings, tail, engine, etc. There's a chance the pilot is killed, or that the plane catches fire.<br/><br/>Fuel eventually runs out and the pilots fly off to meet another day --if they survived. <br/>This is a lot of fun with massive numbers of players; you can put the 20-odd planes on the map at once, balancing the better airplanes with weaker pilots.<br/><br/>The second edition introduced crude altitude rules, and in 1995 GDW put out full-blown miniatures rules.<br/><br/>The 2014 edition of Blue Max had substantial changes, and can be found with its own game page HERE.<br/><br/>",

For you, on the other hand, they present a wonderful business opportunity!<br/><br/>In The Road to Canterbury, you play a medieval pardoner who sells certificates delivering sinners from the eternal penalties brought on by these Seven Deadly Sins. You make your money by peddling these counterfeit pardons to Pilgrims traveling the road to Canterbury. Perhaps you can persuade the Knight that his pride must be forgiven? Surely the Friar's greed will net you a few coins? The Miller's wrath and the Monk's gluttony are on full public display and demand pardoning! The Wife of Bath regales herself in luxury, the Man-of-Law languishes in idleness, and that Prioress has envy written all over her broad forehead. And the naughty stories these Pilgrims tell each other are so full of iniquity they would make a barkeep blush! Pardoning such wickedness should be easy money, right?<br/><br/>Not quite. For you to succeed as a pardoner, you'll need to do more than just sell forged pardons for quick cash. To keep your services in demand, you will actually need to lead these Pilgrims into temptation yourself! Perhaps some phony relics might help? There is also one big catch. The Seven Deadly Sins live up to their name: each sin that a Pilgrim commits brings Death one step nearer, and a dead Pilgrim pays no pardoners!<br/><br/>So much to forgive, so little time. Will you be able to outwit your opponents by pardoning more of these Pilgrims' sins before they die or finish their pilgrimage to Canterbury?<br/><br/>",

Keep your cards a secret. Rack up points by finding sets of three in the deck. Find matches before anyone else does. If someone plays Burrito Cards, a Battle ensues. Steal points from your opponents by hitting them with squishy toy burritos. Declare war on your friends. Some battles only involve a handful of players. Others force the entire table to engage in a Burrito War. Duel to determine the winner.

Imperial Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were the two other main Central Powers.<br/><br/>The major Allies, sometimes referred to as the Entente, consisted of the British Empire, France, Italy, the United States, and Imperial Russia. The alliance included other historical members, but they more or less fell under the command and control of one of these great powers. In fact, had General Pershing not insisted that its integrity be maintained, even the American army would have found itself as simply being replacements for French and British.<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies: WWI 1914 puts players in charge of one of the major powers, each with its own infantry sculpt; other sculpts represent the artillery, tanks, aircraft, and naval line-up of either the Allies or the Central Powers.<br/><br/>As designer Larry Harris notes, &quot;While playing this game, you will quickly realize that this is not World War II. There are no massive sweeps across continents with blitzing armored divisions and aircraft. Instead, there are a series of determined offensives resisted by equally determined armies dedicated to holding the line. You will find that your depleting resources of men and artillery must be deployed with great thought and efficiency. You will be fighting pretty much the way man has been fighting with each other for thousands of years &ndash; only this time the ability to kill your enemy, and for him to kill you, has become intolerably efficient.&quot;<br/> Despite what the back of the box says about the playing time (1-3 hours) the Avalon Hill website correctly states 8 playing hours for this game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In The Cave, a board game from K2 author Adam Kałuża, players take on the role of a speleologist team tasked with exploring a newly discovered cave. Players start from a base and explore a cave, tunnel after tunnel, effectively building the board (the cave). They have to overcome steep descents, underground lakes, and tight squeezes. They will be given a chance to admire the wonders of the underground, like halls full of stalactites. To make it all possible they must take the right supplies with them, like ropes, oxygen and batteries.<br/><br/>Each turn players have five action points to use for moving, discovering new cave tiles, exploring them, and packing their backpacks when they go back to the starting base. They need ropes for descents, oxygen to explore underwater parts, and a camera to photograph underground wonders. Planning what to take with them is one of the most important things in the game. Each turn that their pawn is not in the starting base, players must use (i.e., throw out) one basic supply from their backpack; these costs, along with the expenditure of other supplies during exploration, forces them to return to the starting base a few times during the game. To keep them from having to carry everything, though, players can raise a camp somewhere in the tunnels where they can store some of the equipment.<br/><br/>The cave differs every game, so players have to be prepared for everything or they will lose time. Players earn points for exploring different tiles: underwater, wondrous, descents, and so on &ndash; but to win they'll need to acquire bonus prizes for exploring the most tiles of each type. This make decision-making during trips very difficult.<br/><br/>When the cave is fully explored, the player who made the biggest effort in the most spectacular way wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Serenissima is the new Ystari edition of the 1996 game (M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e in France). The rules have been updated and the game is more fluid.<br/><br/>In Serenissima players represent a merchant family during the Renaissance. Players attempt to balance the need of trading and open commerce versus the cut-throat economic piracy of the day. Players create a fleet of ships to purchase and move various commodities around the Mediterranean while also keeping well manned ships to attack and defend against other player's fleets.<br/><br/><br/><br/>(block of information submitted by user in comments not included in game entry)<br/>Board<br/>The maritime areas are bigger and there are fewer of them. Starting ports are different too: Alexandria is one of them in the new version.Resources and Trade<br/>One of the resources has changed (marble replaces gems) and the ports produce different resources compared to the 1996 version. In the 1996 version, when buying goods from a port owned by another player, you had to bargain. It could be hard. Now, you just pay them 1 ducat, instead of paying the bank.<br/>Wine is now special: one port with wine in its warehouse is worth more VP at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Game Flow (big point)<br/>In the 1996 version, all the players used to bid for turn order. Then, they all played the phases according to this order: they loaded, built and bought, then they all moved their galleys, they fought and finally they took over free ports and made money.<br/>There's no bidding anymore. Now, the galleys you build are numbered, and when it's the turn of one specific galley, its owner can perform their actions (load, move and fight, or build), before the next galley is the active one. If your galleys have successive numbers, you can play several times.<br/>The little flags that used to be awkwardly fixed on the galleys are now useless, and the men have to be in the player's colour (instead of being a nice bunch of nice Sailor Smurfs).<br/>This is a major difference, the game is radically altered.<br/><br/>Counts and Victory Points<br/>There are several counts in the game, and not only one at the end of the game. What's more: another kind of count can bring players money if they have wine in their warehouse. All of that depends on the drawn cards at the end of a galleys' turn. The pace of the game may be altered by those cards, too.<br/>There is no card in the 1996 version.<br/>In this old version, the only way to have your port well valued at the end of the game was to have its warehouses full. It's now different too: a port with one good is better than one with none, but worse than one with two, etc.<br/><br/>Other Changes<br/>There's a building more: basilic. It brings more VP.<br/>Galleys are easier to build but the price is not the same.<br/>Combat rules are very different, the fort has a different power. Dice are different too.<br/>Port limits to recruit sailors are different.<br/>2 and 3 players rules are different.<br/>...and this list is all but exhaustive.<br/><br/>",

US soldiers joined forces with Wehrmacht infantrymen, an SS officer, an Austrian resistance fighter, and recently freed French prisoners of war to defend an Austrian castle against an attacking force from the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division.<br/><br/> <br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tObject of the GameDuring a game of Castle Itter, you take the role of the force that defended the castle from 0400 - 1600 on 5 May 1945. The goal of the game is to last until the SS deck is depleted, without allowing SS Counters to reach the castle. You score points for each Defender that survives the assault and lose points for each SS Counter remaining on the board at the end of the game - the higher your score, the better. <br/>  <br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tGame OverviewCastle Itter is divided into turns. Each turn consists of two phases:<br/><br/>&bull; Defender Phase: Take five actions with Defender counters<br/>&bull; SS Phase: Play three SS cards<br/>  <br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefender PhaseDuring each turn you take five actions with your Defenders. You can only take one action with a Defender on a turn. When you take an action with a Defender, place an Action Token on the Defender.  If you use an action that exhausts a Defender, flip the Defender to its exhausted side. The actions include:<br/><br/>&bull; Attack<br/>&bull; Suppress<br/>&bull; Move within a location<br/>&bull; Move to a new location<br/>&bull; Special Actions (Command and Escape)<br/>&bull; Recover<br/>  <br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tSS PhaseOnce you have completed your five Defender actions for the turn, reveal three SS Cards from the SS deck, one at a time, resolving the effect of each one before moving to the next. After all three SS Cards have been resolved, discard them. The turn is over and the next turn begins with five new Defender actions.<br/><br/>There are four different categories of SS Cards, based on the card effect:<br/><br/>&bull; Attack Defenders<br/>&bull; Attack Location<br/>&bull; Disrupt Defenders<br/>&bull; Place SS Counters<br/>  <br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tEnding the GameThe game ends at the end of the turn when the SS deck is exhausted or immediately if the 142nd Infantry Regiment card is drawn from the SS deck.<br/><br/>",

Game ends when all cards have been auctioned and clayers with the highest total of good cards wins. Cards are both: money on your hand for bidding and points for scoring in each set sold.<br/><br/>Goods cards and merchant cards are shuffled together and form the stack of goods to be auctioned. Depending on number of players offer cards from 1 to 6 are used (eg 4 players, cards 2,3,4,5) with the highest card on top. The highest offer card is used to draw that number of goods to make the actual offer on the table. Players start with 4 goods cards in their hand as money for bidding. Players bid in clockwise order increasing their bid at least by 1 - or they pass. Last player with a bid will win the total offer. The bidding cards (= good cards from the players hand) will be placed face up and sorted by kind into the market. Also one of the cards of the offer he won has to be paid as &quot;tax&quot; to the market also- players choice. Than he takes all the other cards of the offer into his hand and he also places the offer card of the actual bid in front of him. He is not allowed to bid again in this round.<br/><br/>Game goes on with the next highest offer card giving the number of goods making the new offer. So each round each player win different a decreasing number of good cards. When all offers are gone the open market is usually filled with goods. Than the player with the lowest offer card - the same player who won the most less good cards - has free choice to take all cards of one kind from the goods in the market. Often this is a really great grab!<br/><br/>Following rounds are played the same way until all goods have been auctioned. Players can also sell sets consisting of exactly 3 cards of the same good from their hands whenever they want. That is no real sale but players hold the highest card of each set for scoring. Merchant cards can be used as a joker - even two merchants are allowed in a set of 3 goods. Although merchant cards have a value of 0, a set of 3 merchants will score 5 points!<br/><br/>96 cards with 6 different goods (eg cloth, wine, spice)<br/>   - each good with values 1 (6x), 2 (5x,) 3 (3x), and 4 (2x) <br/>16 merchant cards value 0 but replacing any card you want in a set<br/> 6 offer cards (from 1 to 6) showing the number of cards to be auctioned<br/> 2 market cards where to place cards spend for bidding and &quot;tax&quot; cards<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game is part of a family which includes Top Race, Daytona 500, and Formel 1.  Players are dealt a hand of cards which have movement numbers for one or more of the cars.  When a card is played, the cars are advanced the number of spaces indicated in order from top to bottom.  However, if the track is blocked, then that movement is lost, so the idea is to use the cards that help your opponents (which you'll likely have to play eventually) only when they won't be able to take advantage of the movement.<br/><br/>",

At the beginning of the game, all players are human and there is no reason not to trust each other completely, but as the temperature drops and mistakes are made, players start doubting everything and everyone around them.<br/><br/>You must build, trade, and upgrade to prepare yourself for the Antarctic Terrain, rabid dog attacks, crazed madmen...and most importantly, the alien entity that is now loose in the camp. Everything you build and upgrade has one purpose...keeping you alive and human! During the entire game, you will want to trade with other players and help each other build stronger weapons and better equipment, while also passing food and med kits around. Although, make sure your trust them, since trade is a huge opportunity for The Thing.<br/><br/>Staying inside may keep you from freezing to Death, but it won't help you or your fellow humans win. The only way to secure victory is by venturing out of the camp! The problem with that is, being away from camp is the number one way to come across The Thing...leaving you vulnerable and exposed to infection. Whether fixing the boiler, repairing the door, or fighting the frigid temperatures outside, you will all need one another to survive. But trust is a hard thing to come by when you must be wary of...Who Goes There?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Sakura Duel &mdash; known in Japanese as 桜降る代に決闘を and also released as Sakura Arms &mdash; is a two-player dueling game in which players first choose two of seven megami (Japanese goddesses), each of which has a different keyword that empowers some of their cards. Players then see what the opponent chose before assembling a deck of ten out of 22 cards, with the players choosing cards both to take advantage of their own megami powers and to exploit their opponent's weaknesses. Players then duel to see who will be victorious.<br/><br/>The game uses a single kind of token to represent life, distance, aura (defense), and flare (special energy) based on the zone these tokens occupy. By moving tokens between zones, you attempt to gain the ideal position and set up as many attacks as possible &mdash; or be prepared to avoid attacks.<br/><br/>The gameplay at its core is simple, and due to its limited environment, it is relatively easy to learn the cards for a deck-building game. Building a deck and playing normally takes less than 20 minutes.<br/><br/><br/>This is the first release for the second version of the Sakura Arms game system. A third version, with system changes and balance updates, has since been released.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Here's a game that's enormous fun and will sharpen your wits and hone your imagination. The 54 images were designed by Rory O'Connor of Ireland, a trainer in creativity and creative problem-solving. They can be used to arrive at answers or decisions in an indirect and ingenious way.<br/><br/>Originally Rory had put the images on the faces of a Rubik's Cube, and players would turn the Cube to scramble the images, then choose one side to play with. Kate Jones of Kadon Enterprises suggested putting the 54 images on 9 separate cubes, to allow for quicker ways to generate more varied combinations, including conceptual puzzles. Rory readily agreed, having considered the 9-cubes idea himself earlier. At a creativity conference held at Kadon headquarters in May 2004, a prototype was whipped up, and in 2005 Kadon launched the cubes version of Rory's Story Cubes.<br/><br/>Each jumbo 1&quot; cube has 6 images or icons, with a total of 54 all-different hand-inlaid images that can be mixed in over 10 million ways. You roll all 9 cubes to generate 9 random images and then use these to invent a story that starts with &quot;Once upon a time...&quot; and uses all 9 elements as part of your narrative.<br/><br/>Play it as a game for one or more players, or as a party game for three or more. Or play it as an improv game where each player contributes part of the story, picking up where the last one left off. Win award points for speedy delivery, inventiveness, imagination, drama and humor.<br/><br/>Full instructions include several other ways to use the cubes to solve problems, break up writer's block, enhance your imagination and heighten your ability to find unifying themes among the diverse images. Interpret or get at the meanings of your answers more quickly. It's fun, easy, and mind-stretching.<br/><br/>As a puzzle the cubes will really give your imagination a work-out. You'll practically feel both sides of your brain dancing. The challenge: Fit the 9 cubes into a 3x3 square. Now examine the cubes in any one row and turn them so their tops have something in common. Do this for all 3 rows. Explain your choices, or challenge another player to identify the element they share. More than one answer may be right, and there are thousands of possible combinations.<br/><br/>Rory's Story Cubes are recommended for all ages over 8, though it's fun to watch a younger child create combinations with the cubes and make up stories.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player plays as many cards as desired by paying the cost of each card &mdash; that is, discarding cards of the proper colors that match the cost of the card being played &mdash; then placing the card in an empty slot on their side of the game board. Many cards have powers that take effect when played.<br/><br/>After playing cards on a turn, each card does damage equal to its strength to any opponent's card on the other side of the game board. If no opponent's card is present, then with military power the player does damage directly to the opponent, swinging a pendulum of strength in their favor. If you reach a total of 7 on the pendulum, you win. Your troops can also grant you an additional card at the end of the turn (three instead of two) or tokens that make it cheaper to play cards.<br/><br/>Instead of winning via military, you can instead win by having all six slots on your side of the board filled with cards at the start of your turn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Yggdrasil Chronicles, each player takes the role of a Norse god and attempts to keep evil forces from devastating the nine worlds, destroying the world tree Yggdrasil, and surviving the onset of Ragnarök.<br/><br/>To set up, each player takes one of the seven Norse gods, 5-9 life points (depending on the player count), and a set of cards showing the six enemies who are attacking the nine worlds; you shuffle these enemy cards and place them next to you. These nine worlds are represented on a three-level, 3D game board, with the board having locations for artifact cards, creature cards, hero pawns, elf pawns, anonymous pawns, and more. Each level of the board depicts three worlds on it, and the middle board rotates.<br/><br/>At the start of a round, each player places the top card of their enemy deck on the &quot;Wheel of Enemies&quot;. Players can take turns in any order. On a player's turn, they first reveal their enemy card. If this is the first appearance of this enemy this round, the player continues their turn; if not, then the enemy is activated, typically moving to a different world, then taking some action. If the enemy can't move, e.g., Surt is supposed to move up a level, but is already on the top level, you lose the game. If the enemy can't take its action, e.g., Loki needs to place an Iotunn pawn, but none remain in Iotunheim, you lose the game.<br/><br/>While normally you hope to avoid duplicating an enemy, you want to double up on Nidhögg as that enemy starts on the leftmost space in your saga book, and if Nidhögg moves all the way to the tree icon, you win the game. (Nidhögg might also trigger effects when moving to a new location.)<br/><br/>If an enemy moves to where another enemy is located, that world is devastated and no action is possible there except for healing the world tree.<br/><br/>Whether or not an enemy is activated, you can then move &mdash; either to a different world on the same level or a different level above or below your current location &mdash; then act, either performing the action of the world in which you're now located or fighting. Powerful god that you are, you always win a fight, but you suffer &quot;risks&quot; equal to the strength of the enemy. You can sacrifice heroes in Valhalla to remove risks or make saving throws on dice, possibly with an elf assist, but each risk you don't prevent costs you 1 life point &mdash; and if any god runs out of life points, you lose the game.<br/><br/>As for performing world actions, you can collect elves, heroes, artifact cards; remove Hel's anonymous minions or Surt's fire giants; or receive help from worldly creatures. If another god stands in this world, your action is improved; if an enemy stands in that world, then your action is penalized.<br/><br/>In addition to that base game, you can play Yggdrasil Chronicles on the hard mode, which increases the challenge of gameplay while giving each god unique powers. The game also includes a six-saga &quot;Ragnar&ouml;k campaign&quot; that begins with Baldr's murder, then carries on from there.<br/><br/>",

To do this, players must win over the craftsmen of the city's various guilds. The player who manages to win over the most (and the most influential) craftsmen will be the one who wins the game.<br/><br/>Every round consists of one or more turns. Every turn, all players simultaneously select the guilds at which they wish to take actions, limited by the number of agents at their disposal. Actions include buying and selling goods and hiring guests who are lodging at the guilds: various craftsmen and townsmen with useful special abilities.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, the master of each guild will select a favorite from among the players: the one owning the most of that guild's goods. The favorite of each guild will claim the loyalty of that guild master and earn one of that guild's crests. The most important guild in the city will also bestow one of the valuable prestige crests upon its favorite.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players will compare their amassed craftsmen, crests, money, and townsmen to see who has won the game!<br/><br/>",

After Britain refused to deliver newly ordered Turkish battleships, the Turko-German fleet bombarded Russian forts, signaling the Ottoman Empire&rsquo;s entrance into World War One.<br/><br/>Ottoman Sunset 2nd edition, by designer Darin Leviloff, is a stand-alone solitaire States of SiegeTM game on World War One in the Near East from 1914-1918. The player controls the Young Turks (CUP or Committee of Union and Progress) as they try to keep the Ottoman Empire alive amidst the struggles of the Great War.<br/><br/>After many years of being the &ldquo;Sick man of Europe,&rdquo; by the late 19th century the Ottoman Empire attempted to reform and modernize itself. Ironically, such attempts convinced restive nationalities such as the Greeks, Romanians, Bulgarians, etc., to assert their independence and/or seek to expand their territory.<br/><br/>This weakness caused other Imperial Powers to seize Ottoman territory, both formally and informally. By the outbreak of World War One, the Ottoman Empire was reduced to a core of territory in Asia Minor, the Levant, the Hejaz, Mesopotamia, and a sliver of European territory. This collapse led the military-political leadership in Turkey to take over under the guise of the Young Turks.<br/><br/>The Ottoman Empire began with lofty strategic goals, but soon faced a hard slog, defending its core empire against far-flung British-led forces, Russian armies, and a Hashemite Arab revolt. Furthermore, ongoing campaigns on other fronts, such as those with Austria against Romania in the East, against Italy on the Isonzo, and of course the draining stalemate of the Western Front had a direct impact on events in this theater. Like Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire needed direct German aid to keep it in the conflict.<br/><br/>Despite victories at Kut and Gallipoli, by October 1918, the Turks had about all they could take and surrendered. Can you lead the Ottomans in the Great War and achieve victory where your historical counterparts failed?<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/><br/>Complexity: 3 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 9 on a 9 scale<br/>Scale: Each unit is one Allied Front, and each turn is a few weeks of real time<br/><br/>What's In The Box?:<br/><br/>&bull;    One 24-page full-color Rules booklet<br/>&bull;    One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; paper game map<br/>&bull;    50 cards  <br/>&bull;    57 thick, two-sided, multi-shaped game pieces<br/>&bull;    One six-sided 12mm die<br/>&bull;    One 11&rdquo; x 17&rdquo; mounted, jigsaw-cut game map <br/>&bull;    One bright red, 9 1/4&quot; x 5 7/8&quot; Standard cardboard VPG game box<br/>&bull;    One beautiful box cover sleeve<br/>&bull;    One &quot;Wipes-A-Lot&quot; napkin<br/>&bull;    One charcoal dessicant packet<br/><br/>",

With ideal dice combinations, players can improve their camps, catch new monsters, and use the abilities of previously captured monsters.<br/><br/>At the start of Monster Expedition, which is set in the same world as 2019's Carnival of Monsters, players each receive a set of three supply camps, and a wilderness display is formed from ten cards. Create a draw pile based on the number of players, then place this deck in the center of play, along with the game board and dice.<br/><br/>On your turn, you choose one of your three camps, then go monster hunting, with your camp level determining which dice are available. At the start of the hunt, you roll all the dice, and after each roll, you set aside all dice of a chosen value that you haven't yet set aside. If you can't set any dice aside, the throw counts as a miss and you lose the best dice you laid out previously.<br/><br/>When you stop, use the set-aside dice to capture monsters from the wilderness and improve your supply camps, possibly calling on abilities from monsters already in your collection. When the draw pile is exhausted, complete the round so that all players have had the same number of turns, then tally the points to see who took the biggest haul.<br/><br/>",

To do this, you have to attract more citizens, encourage the growth of residential areas for them to live in, and aid the expansion of both the commercial and industrial sectors &ndash; though the latter sector also brings pollution with it, and you need to deal with that, too, as high pollution levels will have a negative effect on your score at the end of the game.<br/><br/>If you build suitable infrastructure, your citizens will undoubtedly vote for your re-election, but beware of false promises! Votes can be earned over the course of the game by placing citizens in the residential spaces, by erecting cultural buildings, by keeping commercial buildings in suitable areas, and also by making good on the promises that you made to the citizens at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>The player with the most votes (i.e., victory points) after eight turns wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An epic fantasy quest to recover an ancient magic scepter from a tyrant king in his Dark Tower, brought to life in electronic form.<br/><br/>To vanquish the usurper, players search the four realms of the circular game board for three keys to unlock the tower's gate.  On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay siege to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.<br/><br/>Dark Tower was technologically impressive when it was released in 1981.  Gameplay was facilitated by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors. The computer would play brief musical serenades at significant points of the game.<br/><br/>",

Game mechanisms deal with Radar warning(and lack of), weather and observer corps. The cardstock map covers southern England with graphics for airfields, industrial sites and ports.<br/><br/>You control British, Commonwealth, Polish and Czech Air Force Squadrons, positioning the day's patrols where you believe the Nazis will strike. Day after bloody day, the RAF must rise to battle the modern fighters of Luftflotte 2 and 3 while Nazi bombers pound England into ruin - and submission. You must intercept German bombers, sacrificing dwindling men and equipment to halt the German war machine.<br/><br/>The game system controls the Luftwaffe, directing a coherent bombing campaign against targets vital to British survival. A unique card system hides the strengths, compositions, and targets of the German strikes until after you've decided where your squadrons will patrol, and which raids you'll intercept. You make the decisions that could save democracy.<br/><br/>RAF offer three scenarios. The Hardest Days, The Thin Blue Line, and The Battle of Britain cover the entire struggle from beginning to end.

When three friends find each other, they head to the caf&eacute; instead.

You score points for each of your family members who get on. All family members have a &quot;Cut In Line&quot; ability or a &quot;Lost Child&quot; ability. Use those abilities well to cut your way to the front of the elevator line, and squeeze into the elevator, just before the doors close. If they get on the elevator that goes to their favorite floor, you get double points. The game is played over three rounds, and scoring takes place at the end of each round.

World Championship Russian Roulette is also a bluffing game. At the beginning of every round, players place one of their gun cards into their &quot;pocket&quot;, providing them the opportunity to cheat by pocketing their bullet card. Careful though.

        "description": "The Fast Action Battle (FAB) Series - Volume 1: The Bulge<br/><br/>From Rick Young, designer of Europe Engulfed, comes a series of fun, tense block games. FAB games focus on speed and playability with low-unit density while keeping the history both accurate and exciting.<br/><br/>Volume 1: The Bulge brings you the Battle of the Bulge from December 16th through December 27th. You command the division and brigade level units using the historical orders of battle. You order your forces to key points, and decide how and when to order extra Assets to bolster them. Note that there are never enough of these Assets to give to all the units begging for them, so you need to weigh your decisions carefully.<br/><br/>FAB delivers a new blend of units and decisions to the block game genre: your forces are a mixture of wooden blocks and die-cut counters.<br/><br/><br/>     Blocks: your divisions and brigades are multi-step wooden blocks with printed labels on one side only, with step-losses represented by rotating the blocks. FAB has a new twist on the units in that the pips on the edges of the blocks are color coded to represent troop quality, which can change as a Division suffers losses. Elite Units can lose their edge and become Veteran, while Green Units can harden and become Veteran as they experience the strains of combat. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Counters: Die-cut counters represent (1) additional Assets available to you as the Field Commander and (2) major Events that could have or did occur during the battle. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Assets represent engineers, army level artillery, independent armor and infantry regiments/battalions, and other small units that can be temporarily assigned to the battles that you deem important to your strategy. <br/><br/><br/><br/>     Randomly drawn Events provide divisional replacements, air strikes, interdiction teams, parachute drops, and events unique to each battle in the Series. These Events represent unique opportunities which you can use to influence the outcome, although you cannot count on exactly when these opportunities will be available to you. <br/><br/><br/>Another strong element of FAB is the return of Special Actions, which have already been proven in GMT&rsquo;s Europe Engulfed design to give flexible, exciting game play. Special Actions give you tense choices in deciding how and when to seize initiative or interfere with a sudden move by your opponent.<br/><br/>Series Designer: Rick Young<br/>Series Developer: John Foley<br/>Published: 2007<br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>     Wargameroom (real-time)<br/><br/><br/>",

Attackers from the German 6th Army must dislodge the Russian 62nd Army and take the city of Stalingrad before the commencement of Operation Uranus. If the city could be taken, German troops could then be re-deployed to reinforce the Italian and Rumanian formations holding the flanks of along the Volga. The fiasco at Stalingrad can then be prevented.<br/><br/>The game is an operational level treatment of the actual streetfighting. Each turn is a day comprising of a variable number of daylight and night impulses. Units are battalions and armoured units representing AFVs in platoon and company strength. The map is on a scale of 1 inch to 500 metres, depicting the city of Stalingrad and its western approaches, divided into 74 areas divided according to terrain features, and rated for defensive suitability. Victory is determined by the number of objectives captured by the German player each week. If it exceeds the requirements for the week, he wins. If not the Russian player wins. If it is equal to the victory requirement, the game is extended by another week, with a different(higher) victory objective requirement.<br/><br/>Game comprises two 22&quot; by 16&quot; mounted mapboards, 394 counters, rules and charts.<br/><br/>The game uses the area-impulse system used in Storm over Arnhem, Thunder at Cassino and Breakout: Normandy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Raxxon is a 1-4 player cooperative card game set in the Dead of Winter universe at the start of the zombie apocalypse. Players each choose one of six different specialists assisting Raxxon with the evacuation of healthy citizens from among the sick. Citizens take the form of face-down square cards in a grid. Through game actions, these can be flipped to reveal whether they are sick or healthy.  There are various types of sick and healthy cards, each triggering different effects when flipped or killed.  Flip too many Chaotic sick and you'll add more citizens to the crowd, or even end the round prematurely.  Killing off the healthy can have similar negative effects.<br/><br/>Each round begins by creating a crowd - a grid of citizens from the citizen deck.  Players take turns performing one action at a time after resolving any consequences marked on their character sheet.  Character actions are powerful effects (kill, quarantine, evacuate, etc) that interact spatially with the crowd (killing a row or column, evacuating one card and adjacent cards of your choice) and have stacking consequences. At the start of each turn, a player must resolve all their consequences from previous turns (flip citizens, add citizens, infect citizens, lose evacuated citizens, etc) before performing another action - and adding another consequence. Some consequences require players to draw Raxxon cards.  Much like Crossroads cards from Dead of Winter, Raxxon cards feature stories relating to characters in play.  Many have multiple parts with different outcomes depending on the choices players make. Often, the choices that make the game easier also grants power to the Raxxon corporation which can lead to defeat.  Consequences don't clear until that player passes for the round.<br/><br/>Once all players have passed, the citizen deck is rebuilt using remaining cards in the deck, the discard, new sick citizens, loosely quarantined citizens, and any cards still in the grid.  The deck is shuffled and used to create a new crowd at the start of the next round.  Players win when all healthy citizens are evacuated. Players lose if the infection deck runs out (the deck of only sick people added to the citizen deck each round) or Raxxon maxes out on power and takes over the city.<br/><br/>Part of the Dead of Winter series.<br/><br/>Two promos for Dead of Winter are included in the box: KD James and Meryl Wolfe.<br/><br/>",

In these troubled times, certain individuals have stepped up to keep the streets safe...while making sure they aren't late to work, or they don't miss another dinner date. Saving the day isn't easy when you've got an active social life to maintain.<br/><br/>In Kick-Ass: The Board Game, players take on the role of one of seven masked vigilantes trying to keep New York City safe. Working together, they must keep the Evil Boss' plan from coming to fruition. Each round, they travel to the various districts on the game board, beating up minions, doing good deeds for the citizens, and trying to keep their personal life from falling apart. It's a difficult task, but luckily, they've got their friends to help them out.<br/><br/>The game includes five different bosses, and all of the different heroes, bosses, mini-bosses, and minions are represented by miniatures. Each of the seven heroes has unique gear and activation cards that they can use.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

However, the winner of the trick is the highest card played, regardless of suit.  The winner gets all the cards from the trick, minus the card he won it with.  That card is given to the player that played the lowest card.  After all tricks have been played, the scoring begins.  Players score the face-value of the cards in the suits that they only collected one or two of, and one point per card for suits with more than two.  The player with the most points after a number of hands wins the game.<br/><br/>",

With help of clever maneuvers they try to outsmart their opponents to get the decisive head start in this eventful race down the river.<br/>There is a lot of pushing and blocking, as all means are allowed to be the first team to reach the finish.<br/><br/>Flussfieber is a gateway game both for families and hardcore gamers. The simple rules with playing a card and moving the lumberjack makes it a fast and fun game. The twist is that every player plays for 2 or 3 lumberjacks and has the cards for both (or the three) pawns in one shuffled pile, so everyone has to plan for all of his lumberjacks with his card hand.<br/><br/>The 6 double-sided game boards offer dozens of different races down the river, which will always be different and funny in each single game, with different elements, like blocked passages and streams.<br/><br/>The beautiful graphics by Maura Kalusky and the new playing figures especially designed for this game help to directly dive into the atmosphere of this game.<br/><br/>Contains: 10 wooden lumberjacks, 45 logs, 90 cards, 6 double-sided game boards.<br/><br/>",

But the many dungeons that litter the mountainsides aren't the only source of danger. Something more terrible is planning an attack on the village. Will you be one of the heroes that saves Tenefyr?<br/><br/>Heroes of Tenefyr is a fully cooperative deck-building game for 1 to 4 players. You represent one of the four heroes and start out inexperienced, but with a unique skill card. As you fight your way through dungeons filled with evil creatures, you'll gain loot in the form of cards that are added to your starting deck. Clear a dungeon of monsters and you will be rewarded by the villagers.<br/><br/>Players will enter dungeons together and fight the enemies within. Combat is simple, with a combined &quot;push-your-luck&quot; element. Your deck represents your hero's health, so when you run out of cards, your hero becomes exhausted and needs to return to the village to rest. Loot cards that improve your deck are gained from defeating enemies, and the most powerful loot is found in the most dangerous dungeons.<br/><br/>Whenever the heroes leave a dungeon and return to Tenefyr, time passes. When a certain amount of time has passed, depending on the difficulty setting, the boss attacks. If you manage to defeat the boss, everybody wins, otherwise you all lose.<br/><br/>",

The workers are planning to strike and since the city is full of troops, they do not know if they will survive that day. Three hours later, the German monarchy does not exist anymore, and the first German democracy is born.<br/><br/>Weimar: The Fight for Democracy is a game about the major actors in the spectrum of the new Republic. The Social Democrats and the Conservatives are trying to defend the democracy. Communists and Nationalists are looking to overthrow the government and install their own regime. Will this infant Republic survive? Or will Germany &mdash; as in history &mdash; fall to the Nazis and become a lawless state? Or will there be a Union of Socialist German Republics?<br/><br/>Weimar includes two major &quot;battlefields&quot;: In public opinion, the parties struggle to influence the important political issues like the economy, the media, or foreign affairs. Winning these issues scores points and allows them to take significant decisions. At the same time, the parties try to control the streets and position their followers in the major cities of Germany for demonstrations, street fights, and actions taken by the paramilitary organizations.<br/><br/>Weimar is a tense and exciting card-driven game (CDG) on a most interesting topic. Cards may be played for the event, for public opinion, or for actions in the street.<br/><br/>In each of the six game turns, the parties play one agenda that defines their strategy for the turn (e.g., modifying their twelve-card play deck, defining issues, getting advantages in the streets). The goals of the parties are asymmetrical and contradictory. While the democratic parties score for stabilizing the state and removing poverty, the non-democratic parties score for coups and unrest.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Autumn is coming to an end in the Savernake Forest&hellip; Help the animals gather and store food for the winter! Savernake forest is a game where 2-4 players build their own section of the forest with paths where animals and food will appear. To get the highest score, players must ensure that on each path the animals can collect their favorite food.<br/><br/>Foxes, hedgehogs, beavers, owls, rabbits, woodpeckers, wild cats... Up to 23 different types of animals live together in the Savernake Forest. At the end of autumn, they all prepare to spend the cold winter with enough provisions and here you are to give them a hand&hellip; Or a paw! To play Savernake Forest you have two decks of square cards, one showing the animals and the other with forest paths full of succulent food. Each player is randomly given an animal card, showing how many foods they can store and their preferences. For example, the fox loves eggs, but not berries or nuts. To get the best score, you must try to get each animal to collect its favorite foods.<br/><br/>During setup, three road cards and one animal card are laid out for all players to see. Each player, on his turn, will choose one of them and add it to his forest, always respecting three rules: there can never be two animals on the same path; cards must be adjacent and no cards can be placed outside of a 4x4 grid. The game ends when all participants have completed their forest, with a total of 16 cards.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will have the help of some animals, depending on the card they choose from the central market. The rooster will help you get up early, so you can be the first to choose a card in the next turn. The armadillo teaches you how to dig better shelters to store more food, so you can take a burrow token and add it to one of your animal cards to increase that animal's storage capacity by 1. The goat teaches you to hydrate yourself better, offering a water drop token that can be associated with a food and increase its value by 1. Finally, the rabbit helps you attract new animals to your forest.<br/><br/>For players looking for more advanced challenges, the rulebook includes a two-player variant with some modifications that increase the difficulty. Quite a boost if you already master the basic rules!<br/><br/>With a dreamy art, Savernake Forest offers a perfect balance between fun and strategy that makes it perfect for any type of playgroup. Family and friends will have a great time helping the animals of the forest, while trying to make the most of their paths to reach the highest score. Stroll through Savernake in the fall and be swept away by the enchantment of its wildlife!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They each act as a member of a secret association, but no one knows who is friend and who is foe.<br/><br/>Each player starts in one of two secret associations. He also gets a secret profession with a special ability. So at the beginning of the game you have no information about the membership and the professions of the others. To win the game, each association has to collect 3 defined artifacts jointly. Therefore you have to find out who your allies are and where to find the artifacts among the other secret objects that are in possession of other players. You can get this information during the game either by trading objects with other players, because every object has a special ability, e.g. &quot;Trade it in and you may take a look at your trading partners-association.&quot; or by struggling with other players, because the winner of a struggle can view the cards of the underdog and steal one of them. But be careful, all players can support the attacker OR defender in a struggle. If they know about your identity but you don't know theirs it may be risky to struggle.<br/><br/>Turn actions, one of:<br/>Trade<br/>Duel<br/>Spy - Choose another player and draw one random object card from her/his hand. Look at this object without revealing it to the other players. Then give it back to her/him.<br/>Declare Victory by naming your team and who has the three items, starting with yourself, OR declare the opposing team and their items.<br/><br/>If someone refuses a trade you offer, you get a duel token as compensation. These tokens are used as extra votes that can be applied in future duels.<br/>Duels: Everyone declares sides secretly and simultaneously. Then anyone can apply items, professions and duel tokens in any order. Players must declare for one or the other and abstentions are not allowed.<br/><br/>Victory: Declare Victory by naming your team and who has the three items, starting with yourself, then one by one. If you name players on your team incorrectly or they don't have the object(s) you lose. You can also declare victory by announcing the opposing team and the members of that team holding their objects by naming them, as firstly part of the team, and secondly that they have a relevant object. If you get the player's team wrong or they don't have the object(s) you lose.<br/><br/>Reimplements: Die Kutschfahrt zur Teufelsburg<br/><br/>",

The only large land mass still held by the Allies was Australia, which they desperately needed as a staging area for a planned U.S. led counter-attack. The Japanese knew of the importance of Australia, but lacked the resources to conquer it, so they decided on the next best thing: Isolate Australia from the United States by building an airfield on the island of Guadalcanal, from which planes could disrupt the Allied supply lines.<br/><br/>The United States, ill-prepared as it was for any offensive actions, immediately attacked with the 1st Marine Division under the command of Major General Alexander A. Vandegrift, caught the Japanese by surprise and easily took control of the airfield. The Japanese 17th Army, under the command of Lt. Gen. Harukichi Hyakutake, counterattacked with an ever-increasing number of troops. For the next four months a titanic struggle took place in the air, on land and on sea as the isolated Marines and U.S. Army fought for their lives to hold their tiny perimeter around the airfield against the might of the Japanese Empire.<br/><br/>Conflict of Heroes: Guadalcanal &ndash; Pacific Ocean 1942 recreates this struggle on your tabletop and includes gorgeous beach and jungles maps of the South Pacific, amphibious landing craft, the USMC, Japanese Banzai Charges, night combat, and much more.<br/><br/>",

Brooding from his darkened hallways, the Forgotten King is a cursed lord who has pledged himself to the service of the Dark Consul, darkening his once lush and verdant lands. At his side are two new mini-bosses: Trent, a towering guardian of the forest with thick bark and brambles for armor, and Boris, a raging brute with snarling ursine features.<br/><br/>In Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King, players explore the Fae Wood, home of the Kodama, sentient forest spirits with a taste for adventuring Heroes. Wisps lure Heroes into ensnaring traps as terrifying, man-eating plants sprout from the loamy forest floor to devour them. Continue into the Lordship Ruins where the once proud bramble knights, now corrupted and twisted into servants of the Dark Consul, stalk the stony ruins for any who would defile their lord's holdfast. Don't get too close to the trees, though, as we hear the squirrels are in an ill mood.<br/><br/>Super Dungeon Explore: Forgotten King includes five new Heroes to brave the depths, including the Thundervale Huntress, Fae Alchemist, Royal Warden, and the brave Questing Knight. Each lend a new dynamic to gameplay and your strategy to conquer the Forgotten King and his minions.<br/><br/>Forgotten King contains two play modes: Classic Mode, in which someone controls the dungeon and its monsters while everyone else takes the roles of the plucky heroes, or Arcade Mode, which allows for a fully co-operative game for up to five players.<br/><br/>Forgotten King, while itself a standalone game, is compatible with all previously published Super Dungeon Explore expansions and supplements.<br/><br/>",

Players can also unleash their special abilities, that may allow them to play more cards or activate special effects.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards, and players draw them according to their position on the racing track, keeping the game always balanced and uncertain until the end.<br/><br/>There is also a &quot;championship mode&quot; that allows players to customize their cars and play multiple races.<br/><br/>The board is modular and is made by twelve cardboard terrains, all with unique effects and obstacles, including various 3D elements like bridges, volcanoes and wild creatures.<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to have the highest remaining Morale when an opposing warband's Morale has been reduced to 0 or below, or if a player ends his or her turn with no creatures on the battlefield.<br/><br/>As a player, you take on the role of a commander, sending a warband to battle the forces arrayed against you. You recruit troops and deploy them on the battlefield. You issue orders to those creatures, outfit them with spells and equipment, and direct their tactics to break the morale of your enemies and drive them from the field.<br/><br/>Dungeon Command: Curse of Undeath includes twelve miniatures specific to this faction pack. While each Dungeon Command faction is meant to be played by a single player, quick-start rules allow two players to engage in a shortened version of the game using only one box.

        "description": "Gambit Royale, first released under the name Ruse &amp; Bruise, is a fast-paced card game in the tradition of Citadels. Magicians and dragons, kings and princesses populate the land and want only one thing: the greatest fame. The players try to use their royal household to cause problems for their opponents and trick them with underhanded chess moves.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game lasts six rounds, and at the start of each round, each player reveals a random goal card worth 1-5 victory points (VPs), each with one of six symbols printed on it. Each player has a deck of influence cards and starts with a hand of three cards. On a turn, a player plays a card face down in front of a goal card, then draws a replacement card; if a face-down card is already present at this goal, the player reveals in and executes the action on it, if any. As soon as all goals have as many cards below them as their VP value, the round ends. Reveal the face-down cards without executing their actions, then carry out the actions of any mercenaries, wizards, witches, and princes/squires in play. Whichever player then has the most influence on a goal (as determined by the values on their played cards) claims that goal, with ties being broken in favor of whichever tied player played on that goal first.<br/><br/>After six rounds, players tally their goal cards to determine their final score; alternatively, if they have a set of six goal symbols, they can sum those six cards, double that value, then subtract 1 VP from that total for each goal card they have that's not part of that set. Whoever has the most points wins!<br/><br/>The 2018 edition of Gambit Royale contains five more cards than the first edition of Ruse &amp; Bruise.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Red Flag Over Paris&quot;, the spiritual successor to Mark Herman's Fort Sumter, is a short, yet challenging, two-player card-driven wargame depicting the two months of intense confrontation between the Communards and the government in Versailles during the 1871 Paris Commune. You will play as one of these factions and fight for control over Paris. But, you will also need to win the hearts and minds of the French population, as the board is divided into two areas&ndash;military and political&ndash;themselves divided into several dimensions (Political Institutions, Public Opinion, Paris neighborhoods, and the forts on the outskirts of the city). The game forces players to make tough decisions like when to focus on political influence or military dominance and how to optimize limited resources.<br/><br/>On top of controlling the military and political spaces and fulfilling your objectives to score Victory Points, you will have to manage your momentum. Versailles needs to collaborate with the Prussian invader to build up an army that will restore order in the Capital. On the other hand, the Commune needs to build a robust revolutionary momentum to ensure that the population stays mobilized after months of siege and food shortages.<br/><br/>Each card represents either a critical personality or a significant event of the Paris commune. You may use a card for its event, for its operational value (which allows you to place or remove influence cubes in any given area), to buy an event discarded by your opponent, or build your momentum. After up to three rounds, Red Flag Over Paris culminates in a Final Crisis where each player will have to play all the cards they left aside earlier in the game as the last opportunity to place influence before determining the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A story goes that while fishermen went a long-term fishing outside the lagoon, their wife who stayed and missed their husband took out needles and made lace like they mended their husband's fishing nets.<br/><br/>In the Middle Ages, Burano lace was highly admired and widely requested by royal families all over Europe. Players represent a family leader on this little island. They can send men to fish for the main source of income, or send women to lacemaking to sale abroad. Making a good living and making Burano become world famous, you have to figure out how to organize family members to their suitable work. It depends on you to earn the glory for your family and lead them to be outstanding from other families.<br/><br/>Burano is played over four seasons, 14 rounds altogether. Through the novel &quot;cube pyramid-driven&quot; mechanism, players take turns paying coins to operate their cube pyramid during each round. The operation of the color-coded cubes would trigger certain actions, such as fishing, lace making, and house roofing, which will earn players victory points (VP).

        "description": "A bidding and tile laying game with a theme of settling 17th Century New England. Each player represents a family that buys up and develops large tracts of land. The area of settlement is 98 squares (9 x 11, with one square missing). Each family starts with a double-sized tile of each of the three land types - settlement, cropland, pasture. Tiles have undeveloped and developed sides; naturally, they start undeveloped.<br/><br/>In each round after the initial placement of the starting tiles, players bid for the right to buy more land tiles or development cards - up to two per round. A total of 9 combined tiles and cards are available each round for purchase. The advantage of bidding high (and thus paying more for each purchase) is that high bidders get the first choice, and the highest bidder gets to decide how many tiles and cards will be up for auction in the next round. Tiles or cards must be played immediately after purchase, unless barns are available to store cards (but not tiles) for later use. Those that can't be played may not be bought.<br/><br/>Development cards are of two kinds. One lets a player buy pilgrims (who generate shillings, the game's currency), barns (to store development cards) or ships (to add extra tiles or cards to those on offer). The other is needed to develop land tiles. Development is possible only if the player owns undeveloped tiles of the same type, number and configuration as shown on the card, e. g., three cropland tiles forming a right angle, two adjacent pastures or a square of four settlements.<br/><br/>Playing development cards earns victory points, the number depending on the difficulty of using the card. A square of tiles scores 10 points, while a pilgrim, barn or ship gains only one.<br/><br/>Play continues until there are too few cards and tiles left to stock a full auction. At that point, the players tally their victory points, adding bonuses for most pilgrims, barns or ships. The winner is the player with the most points; shillings are the tie breaker.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Professor Evil owns a time machine, and he's been ripping off all the best historical items from times both past and future. Your team has been charged with confiscating these items and returning them to their proper locations in time, so you now need to infiltrate the mansion and abscond with four items before Prof. Evil can secrete four of them in locations inaccessible to you. Thankfully the old soul is a bit daft and won't evaporate you should he catch you lurking through the mansion, but simply scoot you out the front door where he'll forget about you immediately.<br/><br/>On a turn, you first draw and reveal two cards from your tiny deck, then keep one of the cards based on what you think will help you this turn. You then take three actions, such as open a door in the room you're in, move from a room (or outside) to another room (assuming the door is open), disable a trap, or grab a treasure; using a card isn't an action unless it says otherwise. You can repeat actions as desired or needed, but you can't enter a room with Prof. Evil and you can't exit the house on your own (in order to run across the grounds to another window) once you enter. You're now committed to grabbing those treasures!<br/><br/>After you finish your turn, Prof. Evil now moves, but again he's not all there, so he doesn't necessarily move in a logical manner. To move him, you roll three dice: One die advances the secondary Prof. Evil figure on the clock on the board either five or ten minutes; the other two determine where Prof. Evil moves and how far. What's more, as he walks through rooms, he closes the doors through which he travels and reactivates any inactive traps he encounters. If you roll a blue and a 1, for example, he moves through the blue doorway into the next adjacent room; a red and a 3 will move him through three rooms, walking through the red doorway each time. A color and a particular signal will teleport him immediately to the treasure bearing the same colored marker.<br/><br/>Let's look at these treasures in more detail: Each treasure shows a time value and one or more traps on it. Three treasures are placed on the board, then a blue, red and green token are placed on the treasures, with a matching blue, red and green token placed on the game board clock on the time matching what's on the treasure. The Magna Carta might say 45 minutes, for example, and after placing a blue token on the Magna Carta, you place a blue token on the clock 45 minutes away from where the Prof. Evil figure is located. If Prof. Evil moves onto this token on the clock, then that treasure is lost &mdash; and if you lose four treasures, then you've lost the game. Remove it from play and replace it with a new treasure, marking the proper time on the clock.<br/><br/>Note that you can't just grab a treasure, however. Professor Evil can't be in the same room (of course), but you also must ensure that all the traps shown on the treasure are currently deactivated. The game board starts with eight traps on it &mdash; half active, half not &mdash; and you'll play tug-of-war with Professor Evil over keeping them in this status. Collect a treasure, and a new one will be added to the game board; collect four treasures before Prof. Evil does, and you all win Professor Evil and The Citadel of Time.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a Spanish card game born in Basque Country. The first reference about this game goes back to 1745, when Don Manuel de Larramendi, philologist and Jesuit basque, quoted it in the trilingual dictionary (Basque-Spanish-Latin).<br/><br/>It is played by two opposing pairs of players with the Spanish deck, which is a deck of 40 cards without eights or nines and no jokers. Usually all 4 &quot;3&quot; cards count as kings and all four &quot;2&quot; cards count as aces. It has a variety of different rules in the different regions of Spain.<br/><br/>In every round of the game Mus (discard) is either agreed or stopped. Then, four bets are made on the same hand of cards:<br/>    * Grande (Biggest): playing for the highest combination of cards; handiak (big ones) in Basque.<br/>    * Peque&ntilde;a or Chica (Smallest): playing for the lowest combination of cards.<br/>    * Pares (Pairs): playing for the best matching card combination; pareak in Basque.<br/>    * Juego (Game): playing for cards total values of 31 or more. Sometimes replaced by a Punto (Point) special round; jokua in Basque.<br/>At last, accepted bets and passes are counted until one of the pairs of players reaches the previously agreed amount (different standards in different regions of Spain, but most commonly 30). The pair of players winning most out of three games wins a vaca (which means cow in spanish), and the pair winning most out of three vacas win the match.<br/><br/>One other special feature of Mus is that it is a mostly verbal game, with little card-involving action, limited to deal and discard (if any). After cards are dealt and Mus (discard) is stopped, all rounds are played verbally, bets are called, passed, accepted or rejected but cards are not shown, dealt or touched in any further way, and the player only is obliged to show them in the end of the round if needed in order to resolve any accepted bet. This makes it a poor card game to watch other people play, and learning to play it through only watching is rather difficult in comparison with other card games.<br/><br/>",

After each raid, the Dreadfleet disappears into its lair as quickly and silently as it appeared, far from the reach of Man. And yet there remains hope. Captain Jaego Roth of the Heldenhammer has vowed to hunt down and destroy Count Noctilus and his Undead captains once and for all. With him sail the most notorious and cunning of the pirate lords of Sartosa, each borne to battle upon a giant warship bristling with cannons, organ guns and bolt throwers. At the stroke of midnight on Geheimnisnacht, most forsaken of nights, the Heldenhammer and her companions sail into the realm of undeath known as the Galleon's Graveyard. One by one, Count Noctilus and his vile allies move in to stop them.<br/><br/>Dreadfleet is a boxed game for two (or more) players that includes everything you need to make war on the turbulent seas of the Warhammer world. At your command are two fleets of ships: the Dreadfleet led by the Vampire Count Noctilus, aboard his gargantuan sea-hulk the Bloody Reaver; and the Grand Alliance commanded by the Pirate Captain Jaego Roth, who recently stole the Heldenhammer &ndash; the pride of the Imperial Fleet, and one of the largest galleons to ever sail the high seas.<br/><br/>As your ships engage in furious battle, it's down to you, the fleet captain, to make important split-second decisions. Do you bring all guns to bear on the closest enemy warship, or do you sail into position for a furious broadside? What happens when the warship catches fire, or worse, the powder kegs ignite? Exactly how much punishment can your warship take before it sinks without a trace? Are those Undead seagulls or flying piranha fish?

        "description": "The 17th and 18th centuries were the eras of science. Two of the most impressive personalities of that time were Leonard Euler and Maria Sibylla Merian (who in fact were related). Leonard Euler was a famous mathematician who rendered outstanding services to the number pi. Maria Sibylla Merian was not only a naturalist and explorer but also an artist. Her name stands for the style of detailed portrayal of nature &ndash; see her works on the metamorphosis of caterpillars to butterflies. The illustrations in this card game shall breathe life into that style again.<br/><br/>The name Pi mal Pflaumen is a play on the expression &quot;Pi mal Daumen&quot; &mdash; &quot;rule of thumb&quot; or &quot;roughly&quot; &mdash; which also originated in that period, but now instead of thumbs, players are concerned with fruit. On a turn, players play one fruit card from their hand at a time, then they each claim one of the played cards based on the strength of the card that they played. Each card depicts a fruit, and some of the cards also feature a scoring pattern (e.g., hand in three identical fruits or two pairs of matching fruits) or a special action, such as collecting an additional plum card, stealing a card from an opponent, taking the dog to protect yourself from theft, or collecting three &pi; cards (which can be played singly or in combination with a number card to increase the value of your initial play).<br/><br/>After a number of turns based on the number of players, the round ends, then players receive a new hand of cards. After three rounds, players tally their points based on completed contracts and whoever has the high score wins.<br/><br/>",

They need to modernize these mines so that when these smaller mines are merged into larger ones, they can be prepared to take control of the auction and therefore the larger mine. Additionally, players have to ensure the availability of workers for their mines, while also constructing and caring for a railway system that comprises infrastructure in the mines. Finally, if players don't invest money or workers in their mines in order to secure them, they increase their chance of suffering a mining accident, which will lead to negative fallout when it comes time to bid for consolidated mines.

World leadership came together to build a massive Flotilla, mankind&rsquo;s last bastion of civilization.<br/><br/>Now, ten years after the disaster, the Flotilla is home to the very last of us.<br/><br/>Flotilla features two distinct and interwoven modes of gameplay, as you try to outpace your opponents in bringing prosperity to humanity&rsquo;s new home. You begin the game as a &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; Fleet Commander, commissioned by world leaders to explore the new face of the ocean, scour the depths for resources, and rescue any survivors you come across. At any point in the game, you may choose to turn &ldquo;Skyside,&rdquo; by selling your skiffs, and leaving your seafaring life behind to now grow the Flotilla itself.<br/><br/>The choice of if or when to switch from a &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; explorer to a &ldquo;Skyside&rdquo; settler defines the very core experience of Flotilla. They represent two similar but distinct game experiences, utilizing the same game components, seamlessly intertwined among all players. If you switch, you&rsquo;ll flip over all of your accumulated game components, watching your crew grow into new roles with new art for the same characters, while finding entirely new uses for your ocean tiles and resources, and beginning to trade with the &ldquo;Sinkside&rdquo; players as you go after new objectives. As players turn &ldquo;Skyside,&rdquo; different niches are filled, forever changing the game&rsquo;s economy. Mastering this ebb and flow will be critical if you&rsquo;re to shape the new face of humanity!<br/><br/>As a &ldquo;Sinksider,&rdquo; you will explore the ocean with your skiffs, pulling some of the 92 hexagon-shaped ocean tiles out of a bag, and arranging them to help you effectively collect resources, discover valuable artifacts from the sunken civilization, all while trying to avoid toxic radiation left from the disaster. You&rsquo;ll dive for supplies, rolling a pool of custom dive dice that vary based on the depth level of your skiffs. You&rsquo;ll also carefully manage your resources, trading them on the open market for the currency you can use to buy more skiffs and outposts, or stockpiling them for when you turn &ldquo;Skyside.&rdquo;<br/><br/>As a &ldquo;Skysider,&rdquo; you will use your resources to build an expansive network of watercraft and docks, using the &ldquo;Skyside&rdquo; of your ocean tiles. Your divers will also have new jobs as researchers, rolling custom, multicolor Research dice, to discover new technologies that allow the Flotilla to manage a growing population. You&rsquo;ll also build Sonar stations, making life a little easier for the &ldquo;Sinksiders&rdquo; still out exploring the unknown, while earning quite a few points for yourself.<br/><br/>On both sides, you&rsquo;ll also grow your relationships with the four different governing guilds, each giving you unique bonuses and more powerful crew. The players with the strongest relationships will also earn valuable points at the end of the game!<br/><br/>The components in Flotilla are unique, immersive, and interconnected. Your skiffs will be able to actually carry up to four resource barrels, and come in a unique shape for each player color. Artifact tokens slot into matching spaces in a double-layered hub board and art on the ocean tiles lines up to create a unique layout for your growing Flotilla each time you play.<br/><br/>In Flotilla, you&rsquo;ll find significant strategic depth and variety, while giving players the freedom to tell their own story. Will you build the Flotilla by being the first to go Skyside, or stay Sinkside for the whole game, becoming the most powerful seafarer of them all?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Somewhere on a doomed and distant planet, life has emerged, competing for supremacy until the world&rsquo;s inevitable destruction. The object of the game is to score the most points by the time the world ends. Score points by playing Traits for your Doomlings&rsquo; species, making them more adaptable, resilient, and mischievous. As your Doomlings assert their dominance, Catastrophes will befall the planet, causing setbacks for each competing species. When the third Catastrophe inevitably strikes, the world ends, and the Doomlings with the strongest set of traits gets to look the Apocalypse in the eye and declare&hellip;&ldquo;I scored the most points!&rdquo;<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players draw Trait cards from a community pile, and then play them for points. Traits can also have special abilities and bonuses, allowing players to build a wide range of winning combinations. The game is played in rounds, using Age cards, which have different rules that players must follow. But be warned, hidden in the Ages are Catastrophes: special rounds with adverse effects that force players to adapt their strategy.<br/><br/>Doomlings adds a fun twist to hand management, by introducing the &ldquo;Gene Pool&rdquo; mechanic. Your Gene Pool is your hand size: it is unique to you, and it can increase or decrease through special Traits, or even Catastrophes. Doomlings includes 6 colorful Gene Pool counter cards, elegantly tracking how many cards you should hold at the end of your turn. There are opportunities to increase your Gene Pool (hand size), which can give your species a leg up by providing a larger pool of Traits to select from each turn.<br/><br/>A lightweight card game for 2-6 players, Doomlings can be played casually amongst friends, or competitively by the gaming enthusiast family. Because there are no duplicate cards, and Age cards are chosen randomly, no two games are ever the same. While the game itself can be learned in 5 minutes or less, don&rsquo;t be fooled: with 100+ unique Traits&mdash;in Red, Blue, Green, Purple and Colorless&mdash;and rare, powerful Dominant Traits, there are countless combinations of play to be discovered.<br/><br/>A typical game takes between 20-45 minutes, depending on the number of players and sequence of events. Advanced-play expansion packs are also available, including a Hidden Objective expansion for a fun twist to the game. Doomlings requires no dice or additional pieces, just a jolly embrace of the inevitable end of the world!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Pinochle is played with a modified standard deck.  It consists of a 48 card deck with all 2-8's discarded, and two of each card (a Pinochle deck can be made by combining two 52 card decks and stripping all 2-8's).<br/><br/>Pinochle has several unique elements not found in other trick taking games:<br/>- Before playing the hands, players form melds (runs, marriages, pinochle, sets) which are added to their score.<br/>- Played with a double (and sometimes quadruple) deck of cards: A 10 K Q J 9 <br/>- Players are required trump when void and over trump if they can.<br/><br/>The original version of Pinochle is a two-handed version which is derived from the virtually identical Bezique.<br/><br/>The game was modified for more players with several popular variants including Partnership Pinochle, Partnership Auction Pinochle, and Double Pack Pinochle (Partnership).<br/><br/>(The origin date listed for this game is approximate.)<br/><br/>",

A time of warring Earls, claiming whatever lands they could... establishing fiefs, cultivating powerful vassals, fighting and engaging in endless political struggles &mdash; all while Vikings roamed not just the sea, but the land. It is truly a Dark Age. Or is it? Lasting for 600 years, until the Norman Conquest of 1066, this era decided the future of a great kingdom that would become England.<br/><br/>Designing your Earl Deck before play begins is one of the key features of the game. Ortus Regni is a deck-design game, rather than a deck-building game &mdash; that is, you are entirely in control of the deck that you will begin play with in a game of Ortus Regni. Several canonical Ortus Regni deck design concepts exist &mdash; such as a Lord deck, an Army (Land) deck, a Politics deck, or an Emissary (Monk) deck, and more &mdash; but such concepts are only the start of your design options. The Earl Deck you put together can be a subtle hybrid of several concepts, or something entirely different and unusual.<br/><br/>Your opponents in Ortus Regni will have access to exactly the same suite of cards that you do when they design their own Earl Decks for game play. So it all comes down to your choices and your strategies! There is also tactical space during a game to zig and zag, even if you find yourself against an Earl Deck design that you did not anticipate. You might pull out an unexpected win nonetheless if you play your deck well.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;re staying at one of the three major establishments in Deadwood where you and your associates are working together to steal some of the gold-filled safes floating around town. But you suspect that the &ldquo;friends&rdquo; you&rsquo;re working with are secretly plotting to keep all the gold for themselves. Will you be ready to turn on them before they shoot you in the back?<br/><br/>In Deadwood 1876, you use cards from your hand to try to win Safes from other players. Safes contain Badges, Gold, or Showdown Guns. Near the end of the game, players with Badges get extra turns. After the final turn, the team with the most Gold will advance to the Final Showdown. There, teammates will have to fight each other to the death using Showdown Guns. The last person alive is the winner!<br/><br/>The game is a balance between teamwork and selfishness. If a player uses all of their best cards to hunt down Gold for their team, they&rsquo;ll be defenseless to fight against their teammates if they go to the Final Showdown. But if a player only goes after Guns and saves all of their best cards, their team might not have enough Gold to actually reach the Final Showdown. If someone on your team doesn&rsquo;t seem to be pulling their weight, they might be plotting to steal your gold after using you to get to the Finals! There may come a point where you need to gather Showdown Guns instead of Gold, or attack, mislead, frame, abandon, or banish your own teammates.<br/><br/>Deadwood 1876, volume 3 in the &quot;Dark Cities&quot; series from Facade Games, can have 2-9 players.

By their ability to adapt to new types of terrain, they were able to flourish and eventually dominate the Earth. In this evolutionary game, players control up to six types of creatures indigenous to different regions of the land: Eagles (mountains), Bears (forests), Crocodiles (water), Mammoths (plains), Men (savannah), and Snakes (desert).<br/><br/>Each player takes the role of one of these six creatures, and tries to expand their herd and learn new abilities. As long as there is enough room in the region for all of the animals, the creatures can live together in harmony. Otherwise, battles erupt amongst the creatures for control of the region. Now, the success of the creatures depends on how well they adapt to their new terrain.<br/><br/>Which creature will grow its herd and develop the best strategy for survival?<br/><br/>Original description from the publisher.<br/><br/>",

As with many new businesses, starting up is very difficult. For cultivation and operating of their new businesses, the players will need to rely on loans from the local bank.

Mordak promised the kingdom he&rsquo;d return in 8 days with semi-phenomenal cosmic powers to take his rightful seat upon Shapiro&rsquo;s ruined throne! A lofty promise for an amateur Wizard&hellip;<br/><br/>Valor &amp; Villainy: Minions of Mordak is a one vs many roleplaying board game for 2-6 players. One of you plays as the comically evil wizard, Mordak, and the rest form a band of Allies called the &quot;Order without Borders&quot;, who must halt his path of destruction! The game focuses on a strong and playful theme, capturing the best parts of a classic roleplaying game and boiling it into a one time play session. Every player will appreciate satisfying character progression. Spending Experience Points their team has earned and locating powerful Treasures to make their characters mightier with every passing turn!<br/><br/>Mordak has vanished into the WORLD OF ETERNAL AND UNCARING DARKNESS!

They must hold nothing back, drawing upon all of their cunning and evil genius to win the game for themselves!<br/><br/>The Allies must locate three Ancient Shrines hidden among the land. For each of these Shrines diminishes Mordak's power. Finding them all will reveal his location and commence a final battle for victory. They can explore the map at their own pace, however they will learn they must balance their ambitions with what they can handle! Exploring too quickly will fuel Mordak with threats the game-board has to offer, yet doddling will allow him the time to grow his cosmic powers! Ultimately the winner of the game is the victor of the final showdown between the Allies and their nemesis Mordak! Only the party which is better prepared and utilizes superior tactics will win the day!<br/><br/>",

On a turn, the active player can play a card, draw a card, or quit. To play a card, you must play the same number as the top card of the discard pile or one number higher. If a 6 is on the discard pile, you can play a 6 or a llama, and if a llama is on top, you can play another llama or a 1. If you quit, you place your remaining cards face down and take no further actions in the round.<br/><br/>The round ends when one player empties their hand or all players have quit. In either case, players collect tokens based on the cards in front of them, whether in hand or on the table. Each different number card in hand gets you white tokens (each worth 1 point) equal to the value of the card while one or more llamas gets you a black token (worth 10 points). If you played all your cards, you can return one token (white or black) that you previously collected to the supply. You then shuffle all the cards and begin a new round.<br/><br/>The game ends the round that at least one player has forty or more total points. Whoever has the fewest points wins!<br/><br/>L.A.M.A. Party Edition differs from the original L.A.M.A. in three ways:<br/><br/><br/>    The game includes a single pink llama card that can be played on top of any card; this pink is worth -20 points if in hand at the end of a round.<br/>    Some number cards are now &quot;plus&quot; cards, e.g., 4+, and when you play one of these cards, you take another turn immediately.<br/>    The game includes pink tokens worth 20 points, so your luck can turn around quickly if you win a round and ditch one of those!<br/><br/><br/>",

Different tracks can be arranged with the hexagons reproducing different types of routes: plain, ground rise, mountain pass and downhill.<br/><br/>Every cyclist enjoys the benefits of a free base movement which varies according to his specialty and according to the hexagon at the beginning of his movement. After this kind of movement every racer can add a paying movement. Therefore, the race is based on the riders&rsquo; energy management: initially the riders are all inside the peloton, where it is easier to save energy, but then they will have to find the proper moment to break away to open the definitive gap ahead of the peloton.<br/><br/>The slipstreaming rule assures the simulation of the easier breaking away with a fellow, saving energy by swapping places. Cracks, falls and punctures make the simulation more complete.<br/><br/>Leader 1 has a simple yet fascinating mechanism: players decide the placement and energy management of their riders, facing all the elements of a &ldquo;classic&rdquo; or &ldquo;stage&rdquo; race.<br/><br/>Re-implemented as:<br/><br/>    Giro d'Italia: the Game<br/><br/><br/>Stand-alone expansion:<br/><br/>    Leader 1: Hell of the North<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this light racing card game the players must try to maneuver their team of 2 racing cars into the podium positions over a series of races by playing cards to manipulate the line of vehicles to their advantage.<br/><br/>Players can advance their position by playing cards that move their vehicles up the line or drag other team cars back. More powerful cards may require the roll of a dice and can result in great gains or disastrous engine blow-outs that can put cars out of the race and cannot rejoin the fray until the next race begins.<br/><br/>Play is quick and simple with players required to play one action per turn, carry out its effects and drawing a card to end their turn. Each race will end after the draw deck is exhausted with one final turn taking place. Points are then awarded for positions 1-6 and a leaderboard is recorded. As the game evolves the leaderboard will be forever changing and in the final race the drivers will know what they have to do to earn the points in order to sit atop the final standings!<br/><br/>",

Slowly the settlements were repopulated by other races and culture eventually returned to their walls.<br/><br/>Now, however, the peoples of the forest kneel to one enigmatic sorceress named Adrimon. All who enter slowly succumb to her presence, eventually becoming mindless slaves bound to her will. The cities are now lost, havens only to the mind-wiped. They work tirelessly on the Magi's automatons, enormous constructs fueled by the souls she has bound.<br/><br/>There have been heroes who have faced her and failed. In each attempt, they sacrificed themselves, vowing an oath that just might lead to Adrimon's undoing. These oaths gave power to their equipment creating relics that can diminish her magic, but they have been broken to pieces and scattered throughout the land. It is whispered that the only way Adrimon can be defeated is to find these relic fragments and piece them together.<br/><br/>Enter the Forests of Adrimon and attempt to gather the relic fragments, creating powerful equipment that may help destroy the sorceress. Players will be able to gain Favors from the spirits of the heroes who came before them, sneak into the mind-wiped cities, move though the fey-realm and interact with the Dryad (a powerful ally), battle tough foes and even save some of them from the Magi's wrath. There are hundreds of unique scenarios that can affect each game.<br/><br/>Team up to create your heroes and unseat the terrible sorceress, freeing the mind-wiped from their terrible enslavement.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>FAQ with Official Answers <br/><br/>",

This open countryside is unspoiled by human hands, and it&rsquo;s your job to keep it that way. Make sure the tourists and campers have somewhere to go, but don&rsquo;t let their presence distract you from what really matters.<br/><br/>In Naturopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new landscape. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice.<br/><br/>First, players will randomly flip over 3 cards to see the scoring rules for the game. But not only do these 3 cards determine how you will score this game, they also determine how you win. Total up the values of all three cards, and that number is the scorethat you need to reach in order to win. Each game has drastically different scoring rules in unique combinations, and a new score to beat, ranging from 6 to 51 points.<br/><br/>Each turn, players will play one card from their hand to the growing landscape, trying to score as many points as possible. Players will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types. Watch out though, road maintenance isn't cheap and each road will cost you points in the end. This is doubly true with Naturopolis&rsquo; double-lined roads as they will cost you -2 points each!<br/><br/>New to Naturopolis are the rivers, which occupy space the same way as roads but don&rsquo;t hurt your score. (But roads and rivers cannot connect!) It also adds camp sites, which score based on certain goals.<br/><br/>When all cards have been placed, the game ends and players see if they have met the dynamically generated minimum score for their game.<br/><br/>Can you work with your team to make the most of these natural wonders while still leaving space for tourists, campers, and other visitors? It&rsquo;s time to find out!<br/><br/><br/>Naturopolis is the 3rd game in our series of standalone and combinable Sprawlopolis games. It brings mountains, lakes, forests and meadow blocks to the game, with the added bonus of campsites (which trigger scoring conditions), rivers (which also trigger scoring conditions and cannot connect to roads) and double line roads (which are worth -2 points each as disrupting nature is very costly!)<br/><br/>",

It will be part of the &quot;Great Mausoleum&quot;, a monument built to celebrate the Qin dynasty's endless glory and also to protect him in the afterlife. As a delegate of the Emperor, you will be asked to fulfill his wish by leading a team of workers and helpers to obtain resources, craft and decorate the warrior statues, and supply them with fine wood and bronze weapons.<br/><br/>Xi'an is played over six turns, with two rounds in each turn. This means that each player will play exactly twelve times during the game. During each turn, players draw the first four cards from their personal workers deck, then play two rounds in the turn. First, each player choses two cards and sets aside the remaining two cards face down. The second round will use the remaining two cards. After six turns, the player who has gained the most prestige points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game board depicts a garden as a 6x6 grid in which seed and vegetable tiles are placed using dice rolls as coordinates. Players take turns using the dice to plant, water, and harvest five different types of vegetables with differing point values, from the lowly squash to the mighty eggplant.<br/><br/>The game's chaining mechanism allows players to water or harvest multiple tiles using a single action, enabling players to build upon each others' chains. Players can also use bird and rabbit tiles to eat other players' seed and veggie tiles, but not without paying a small penalty. Two other special tiles &ndash; the sundial and the scarecrow &ndash; allow players to modify dice rolls or protect their own tiles.<br/><br/>The Gnome expansion included in Garden Dice can be added to the base game to give players the ability to adjust the dice rolls for purchasing, watering, and harvesting their vegetables, leading to a more strategic experience.<br/><br/>Bonuses increase the values of tiles as they are harvested, and additional points are awarded at the end of the game for collecting sets. The player with the most points when the last tile is taken wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Shark is a stock-trading game slightly reminiscent of Acquire in that abstract play on the game board determines the share values of the various companies.  The similarities end there, though, as Shark is more free-wheeling than Acquire.<br/><br/>At the start of your turn, you can buy shares (up to five) and sell shares (as many as you want), then you roll dice to determine which of the four company markers you place on the board and in which region. A company marker on its own doesn't contribute to the value of a company; only groups of at least two markers count, so groups of 5, 4, 1, and 1 markers would create a value of $9,000 for each of that company's shares. If you place a marker that combines those two lone markers, then you'd have groups of 5, 4, and 3, so the share price would shoot to $12,000. If you placed that marker on its own, the share price wouldn't change. When you place a marker, you gain money equal to that company's new share price, so you have an incentive to boost a company's size &mdash; but all players receive funds equal to the difference between the old share price and new for each share they hold, so are you enriching them more than yourself?<br/><br/>Of course, you can also place a marker to tank a company's share price. When a company's group expands to touch a smaller group, that smaller group is removed from the board, lowering the value of that company's shares (as long as the group had at least two markers) and costing everyone money equal to the loss in value. (Groups of equal size cannot touch, and you cannot place a marker to force a smaller group to touch a larger one.) To end your turn, you can again sell as many shares as you want and buy shares up to the per-turn limit of five.<br/><br/>Removed markers are banished from the game, not returned to the supply. Once all of a company's markers have been used, or a company's share price reaches $15,000, or all of the shares have been sold, the game ends, and players cash out all their shares to see who has the most money.<br/><br/>",

They can choose 4 out of 6 spaces, called publishing tasks. There are 6 publishing tasks in total that can be performed in any order and lead to 6 specific player actions: hire, develop, ideas, print, sales, and royalties. When a player prints a comic book she must pay using monetary resources ($) + 2 identical token ideas and display, on the table, the comic book cover and, underneath, show both a writer and an artist card. The comics&rsquo; value (needed for collecting orders on the map) will be the sum of the value of its creatives (artist + writer). Each creative card has a value ranging from 1 to 3.<br/><br/>The game lasts 5 rounds. The objective of the game is to accumulate the highest number of fans, make money by publishing comics and create the best portfolio of comic books.

In the last round, the number of fans is converted into victory points. The money accumulated is instead divided by 4.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who scores the most victory points (VP from now on, represented by a star icon)<br/>at the end of five rounds.VP are awarded both during and at the end of the game by:<br/>&bull; Publishing original comic books<br/>&bull; Accumulating fans<br/>&bull; Being at the top of the comic book chart every round<br/>&bull; Earning money (but pay attention to taxes)<br/>&bull; Generating ideas<br/>&bull; Improving the printing quality<br/><br/>",

The game board shows 45 cities connected by a network of potential routes, and all railway lines built will be one of three types: lines owned by you, lines owned by fellow players, and state-owned lines. When you travel along railway lines, you pay nothing to travel on your lines and state-owned lines. To travel on a fellow player&rsquo;s line, however, you must pay them 1 coin, which converts their line to state-owned. From then on, traveling on that line is free for all players. As coins are limited, you should carefully balance the building of your lines with the conversion of fellow players' lines to state-owned lines.<br/><br/>Where do you want to build? At the start of play, each player drafts part of a travel route. Multiple travel routes are available for choosing, and each travel route consists of three cards. When you choose a route, you take either the first and second cards or the second and third cards as your starting and ending point (in that order). Return the unchosen card of that route to the box.<br/><br/>Once the third deck is empty, you can either withdraw from the game with uncompleted routes (returning those cards to the box) or keep taking turns until you finish all your routes, at which point you immediately gain 1 coin and withdraw. In either situation, you earn 1 coin (and do nothing else) on each subsequent turn. Once all players have withdrawn, you tally your score, earning 3 points for each coin, 5 points for the first card you have of a city, and 2 points for each other card you have of a city. (Each of the 45 cities appears once in each of the three decks.) Whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>Free Ride also offers a difficult solo challenge!<br/><br/>",

For the 2009 Z-Man Games version, go to Tales of the Arabian Nights<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Tales of the Arabian Nights is actually several games in one.<br/><br/>In the standard game, the players are characters living in the 1001 Nights universe, wandering about the map and having adventures. These adventures are designed in a sort of paragraph system, with the player to your left reading what happens to you and exposing the choices you have - choices that then lead to other paragraphs or outcomes. The characters evolve during their adventures, acquiring skills of various degrees of advancement to open up new options and various &quot;statuses&quot; (such as married, despondent, cursed, etc) which also affect play.  The object is to become rich and come back to Baghdad.<br/><br/>Other variants of the standard game include the Quest game, which forces you to roam the map looking for quests to fulfill.  There's also a Merchant game, where your adventures give you arrow tokens which are used on a little separate board to simulate the progress of your caravans.<br/><br/>The German edition, Geschichten aus 1001 Nacht, was published in 2000 and contained a revised Book of Tales along with some extra adventures.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Tales of the Arabian Nights<br/><br/><br/>",

The second edition of the game features revised artwork and a crazy camel similar to those in Camel Up (Second Edition) that race backward on the track.<br/><br/>",

Enemies surround the borders, instability spreads over the provinces, and whenever a Roman Emperor fights a threat, usurpers take his place in Rome. The Emperor Diocletian only sees one revolutionary way out: share the power with Maximian, Constantius and Galerius, forming the first 'Tetrarchy'. Now their enemies are doomed...<br/><br/>TETRARCHIA (&quot;rule of four&quot; in Latin) is a cooperative game in which 1 to 4 players take the role of the 4 Emperors, fighting the revolts within the Empire and the Barbarian armies that try to bring it down. With easy rules, the core engine leads to very different games full of interesting choices, with up to 81 difficulty levels. The Draco Ideas edition also includes:<br/><br/>- The Dux expansion, now with 4 independent modules (Dux, Vicarius, Pirates and Goths).<br/>- Plus 6 independent variants, including a new competitive one (Barbaria) that holds up to 5 players.<br/>- Plus 4 updated historical scenarios (Carausian revolt, Danubian Wars, Mauretanian War and Great Persian War).<br/><br/>The combinations are countless! The flow of each Emperor's turn is very simple: spend up to 6 'Imperivm Points' (to Move, Sail, Secure, Subdue or Attack), and then propagate threats with the roll of two dice. The players win if they secure the borders of the Empire before the majority of provinces revolt or Rome falls.<br/><br/>",

They compete to purchase the railroads in order to assemble a network that gives access to important map destinations while simultaneously trying to prevent their opponents from doing so.<br/><br/>From the Box (Avalon Hill Bookshelf Game)<br/>Only in America!<br/><br/>You are living in the heyday of the locomotive. You are Jay Gould. And you have just added another railroad to your vast railroad empire. Flushed with success, you now retire to the sartorial splendor of your very own Pullman Palace Car. The dream ends. You awaken to reality with the thought... &quot;just another fantasy.&quot; Ahh, but for the grace of Avalon Hill, you dream continues.<br/><br/>Here, in Rail Baron, you become a latter day Gould, or a Cornelius Vanderbilt, or any of those menacingly infamous moguls whose wizardry and acumen established the criteria for which business success was to be judged in decades to come.<br/><br/>Rail Baron is played on a large board of the United States RR network. in fact, it comes in three separate boards. Laid end to end, it spell out America and portrays the 28 major rail lines and major cities they connected during the halcyon days of railroading.<br/><br/>You start with $20,000 - and a train. You make money on trips from city to city. Pretty soon you've got enough money to build up your empire (you can buy the B&amp;O and C&amp;O for just $44,000). More holdings bring more money your way (track rental) from your opponents.<br/><br/>With many new nuances of strategy, it becomes a game where fortunes see-saw until the last rail baron is bankrupt - or has accumulated the $200,000 needed to win.<br/><br/>All of this may take 3 to 4 hours. But it's great fun for 3 to 6 people, ages 10 &amp; up.<br/><br/>",

Eventually the dead forgot the living &mdash; if any remain.<br/><br/>But in death, a new life began. The breath of evil from the darkness of complete shadow stirred corrupted flesh. In their middens and pits, the dead awakened, swarming through slime-fluxing tunnels, seeking chthonic power, warring with demons and denizens of the deep. Animated by the black flame, necro-ecologies rose and collapsed in the crypt-universe.  Now, cloistered undead lich-wizards have discovered the primordial opening to the shadow source, the doleful horror-hole where the Eternal Evil Emperor watches and waits....<br/><br/>The necromancers have dug their Lairs deep into the ground. They must gather precious resources and body parts to assemble an army of minions, while defending their own lairs from the excavations and intrusions of others. In the end, the only route is into the demon path...<br/><br/>Then depletion of your essence leads to spending another eternity in foul sepulchral darkness awaiting the next Awakening of Death.&quot;<br/><br/>In Cave Evil, each player takes the role of an ancient Necromancer. Located deep within an earth, their Necropolises have now merged, each seeking the Darkest Pit, the location of all evil. The dark wizards must build minions with precious resources from their Lairs to send forth and destroy, or dig further tunnels to locate other creatures, resources or to ambush another sorcerer.<br/><br/>The game is won when only one remaining Necromancer stands. A Necromancer can either be destroyed by combat, or an enemy minion may venture into their Lair and crush the wizard's shadow power, a Chthonic Crystal. BUT an even greater darkness may befall the players. As they build and destroy creatures the Dark Pit absorbs the shadowflame and may awaken the ultimate cave evil...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Designed by Bruno Cathala and Ludovic Maublanc, Cleopatra and the Society of Architects is a fun and engaging game that includes a three-dimensional palace that players compete to build. Players strive to become the wealthiest of Cleopatra's architects by constructing the most magnificent and valuable parts of her palace.<br/><br/>Players, however, will be tempted to trade in materials of dubious origins in order to build faster. While these corrupt practices might allow an architect to stay a step ahead of the rest, they come with a high price: the cursed corruption amulets honoring Sobek, the crocodile-god. When Cleopatra finally reaches her new palace at the end of the game, she punishes the most corrupted architects (i.e., the ones with the most amulets), depriving them of riches or giving them as a sacrifice to her crocodile! The wealthiest architect from among those still alive wins.<br/><br/>This new edition of Cleopatra and the Society of Architects has a new graphic design by Miguel Coimbra, a free-standing 3D palace, and rulebook updated by the designers for simplicity and fluidity, which incorporates these gameplay changes:<br/><br/><br/>     The combinations of resource cards to discard in order to build pieces of the palace have been reworked.<br/>     The player rewards for building the palace's pieces have been recalculated.<br/>     The consequences of corruption have been reviewed.<br/>     The Great Priest is no longer activated in the same way.<br/>     The player count has changed from 3-5 to 2-4.<br/>     There is a new specific system to manage the character cards, which are no longer part of the deck, and are instead handled separately.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

This is her story.<br/><br/><br/>After the dark descent into the Spire, I felt like a change of pace was in order. With Hildegard, I can do that. I've left behind the cold and the dark for something warm and vibrant.<br/><br/><br/>The game has almost no set-up, intuitive rules, and minimal components. No DM, bookkeeping, or character sheets. What you will have is a stack of over 400 beautifully designed and illustrated cards with some custom dice!<br/><br/><br/>Like the previous game in the Spire's End series, the story unfolds one card at a time. You will be presented with numerous-narrative driven choices, enemies, and items that move the story along.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The land of Cardis has been ruled for many years by King Rhodrig. Cardis is a rich and powerful kingdom controlling all neighboring provinces, which provide valuable resources. All this wealth attracts warlords and raiding parties who more than often launch attacks against the kingdom. So far Cardis has stood against such attacks but with heavy casualties. Thanks to the support of wealthy Archons, the kingdom gets rebuilt so that Science and Arts can flourish once again. At the same time new soldiers are recruited and the army prepares for the inevitable moment when the kingdom will need to be defended once again.<br/><br/>In Archon: Glory &amp; Machination, players are powerful Archons who support Cardis in order to win King's favor. Players use their influence on their Courtiers and on various figures of authority (Magisters).<br/><br/>Each game consists of three Seasons. For each of these Seasons, the King issues different demands that players must fulfill in order to score Victory Points. Each season consists of 3 rounds during which players use a card-driven worker placement mechanism to perform various actions that will allow them to gather resources and income, recruit soldiers and, rebuild the city, and acquire scoring cards (Science &amp; Arts). They will also have the chance to train Elite Warriors to assist in the city's defense. After nine rounds, the game ends and the player with the most Victory Points wins.<br/><br/>",

The more faces they roll, the better they fight the fire. Players can choose to cut firebreaks, which protect tiles from embers blown by wind gusts, or push their luck to reduce flames and possibly even generate reward tokens. If players bust and fail to match at least three of the six symbols on the tile, the fire grows. Another option is to maneuver vehicles &mdash; air tanker, helicopter, and brush rig &mdash; to save the forest.<br/><br/>Flame tokens are added at the end of each player's turn by the draw of a fire card, which can bring about light or strong wind gusts, increase the strength of the flames on certain tiles, and start fires. Too many flame tokens will cause a tile to scorch and be lost. Losing a terrain tile could also affect the game play. Some tiles are tied to crewmembers' special abilities, while others help the firefighters, and still others cause the fire to spread in unique ways. If eight tiles scorch or the fire camp scorches, the game is over and the forest is lost &mdash; but if the intrepid crew can extinguish the fire, the team wins together.<br/><br/>The press-your-luck mechanism with ratcheting rewards creates tension, and the variety of ways to fight the fire makes for interesting choices. The modular tile layout and fire cards bring high replayability to the game, and the acrylic flame tokens provide an enticing table presence.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's still rummy at heart, with multiple suits of 5 cards each, with the twist being that the suits are designated J for Jekyll, H for Hyde, or J/H for suits that count as both Jekyll and Hyde. The unique mechanism in this version of MR is that there is a two sided card (the 'identity card') on the table next to the draw deck, which has Jekyll on one side, and Hyde on the other. At the start of the game, Dr. Jekyll is showing, but this can change if a &quot;potion&quot; card is played (one of the three gavel cards, cards you can only play one of on your turn). You then flip the identity card over, and draw 2 cards from the draw deck. This is important, because you can only play melds whose suit matches the identity that is currently showing.<br/><br/>The identity card is important in scoring as well, because any melds that match the identity card when scoring count double, and during scoring if all your meld suits match the current identity card, you shut the other player out! This makes for a tense endgame, especially if you're trying to go for a shutout, because there is a card 'transformation that can change the value of your or an opponents meld from one suit to another.<br/><br/>Add in one more gavel card type ('work in lab') which lets you draw three cards from the draw deck and keep one, or the top of the discard pile, but only if the card you take matches the identity currently showing. The round ends when one player goes out, and scoring then occurs. Cards in your hand count as negative points.<br/><br/>This is #3 in the Mystery Rummy series.<br/><br/>",

At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of them to create their row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to their row to create their Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.<br/><br/>Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty their Ligretto stack. If a player has a 1 card on top of any face-up stack, they play it to the center of the table. If they have a 2 card of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, they can place the 2 card on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.<br/><br/>If a player can't play anything, they can reveal cards from the stack in their hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. They can play this top card onto a central pile as long as the rules for doing so are met.<br/><br/>As soon as a player empties their Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of their cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in their Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.<br/><br/>A rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from their Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in their row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Dog Lover, you fetch cards, collect bones, and gather food for your lovable dogs. You rescue them from the shelter, train them on new tricks, and cherish their unique traits. The player who takes care of their beloved dogs best will score the most victory points and win!<br/><br/>In more detail, you start the game with a random dog card &mdash; which come in small, medium, and big sizes &mdash; as well as a random &quot;special trick&quot; card. Shuffle the game cards, then lay out the top nine cards in a 3x3 grid. Next to that, lay out three dog trick cards in an adjacent column and three rescued dogs in another column. The player farthest from the start player places the watch dog token next to one of the rows or columns, then the game is ready to play.<br/><br/>On a turn, choose one of your trick cards, rotating it as you desire, then collect cards from the 3x3 grid that match the pattern on the trick card, e.g., common polyomino shapes. You can take at most one card in the row or column under the protection of the watch dog. You can play and tuck cards both before and after you collect cards from the grid. What do you do with what you collect?<br/><br/><br/>    Dog cards sit in front of you immediately. Good boy!<br/>    Food cards are exchanged for one of the four types of food.<br/>    Adoption cards go in your hand, and you can exchange two for a rescued dog, which comes with a special power or endgame bonus.<br/>    Favorite Things cards are dog toys that are more valuable when you collect them in sets.<br/>    Training cards can be tucked under a dog for bonus points, or you can exchange several of them to gain a new trick, which gives you more card-grabbing options each turn.<br/>    Walk cards are worth bonus points when tucked under a dog.<br/>    Bone cards give you a bonus for fed dogs if you collect enough of them.<br/>    Trait cards give an ongoing power and an endgame bonus, but you must attach it to a dog the turn you claim it; otherwise, you must usually discard multiple cards.<br/><br/><br/>When the &quot;End Game&quot; card appears in the deck, you complete the round so that each player has the same number of turns, then you tally points. Each dog has a food requirement. If you meet that requirement, the dog and all its traits and tucked cards will be worth points. However, if you don't give the dog the right type and amount of food, you score -2 points for that dog and ignore all tucked cards that would otherwise give you points (Don't let your dogs go hungry!). The player who scores the most points is the ultimate dog lover!<br/><br/>",

There are nine yellow plastic eggs and one yellow wooden egg (worth 2 points, the others are worth 1 point) and two dice, one red and one white. Although it is, in fact, a children's game, it is great fun when played by adults as well.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to accumulate the most points. First a player rolls the red die. Depending on the result of the die roll, players can:  attempt to be the first to take an egg from the box (or steal from someone else if there are none left in the box); drop an egg on the table and then compete to catch it; or even get up and run around the table to try to be the first back to their seat. When a player successfully wins an egg, he or she then rolls the white die, which indicates the location of the egg; between your cheek and your shoulder, your chin and the breast, between your knees, etc. When the first person drops an egg, the game ends and the one having the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Ages 5 and up<br/><br/>",

This is the 4th Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons Starter Set, your introduction to the worlds and adventures of D&amp;D.  The newest edition to the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Rolpeplaying Game showcases an evolution to gameplay and puts an emphasis on fun.  You, the Dungeon Master (DM), can build and populate dungeons so that your friends can explore fantastic locations, trade quips with terrible villains, and defeat vicious monsters.  Together, you and the players (through their characters) tell amazing stories and have a great time.&quot;<br/><br/>~~~~~<br/><br/>NOTES:<br/><br/>Another version of Wizards of the Coast's dungeon crawl board game-style introduction to D&amp;D, inspired by boardgames like &quot;HeroQuest&quot; and &quot;Advanced HeroQuest&quot; (which in turn were inspired by the original Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing games.) These basic/starter boxed sets attempt to bridge the gap between miniatures board games, miniatures war games, and role-playing games by using a board-and-counter/miniature format with simplified versions of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons rules.<br/><br/>This entry returns to cardboard counters used in the 2000 &quot;Adventure Game&quot; version, after a couple &quot;Basic Game&quot; versions using miniatures released in 2004 and 2006; this version updates the rules set to D&amp;D 4th Edition, and continues the tradition of including completely new adventures and selections of monsters and pre-generated player characters, but is otherwise virtually the same product as its predecessors, and this line of games would be joined in 2010 by yet another updated, &quot;Red Box&quot; 4th Edition Essentials basic/starter game version.<br/><br/>All these basic/starter games are direct fore-runners of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Adventure System&quot; boardgames (&quot;Castle Ravenloft&quot; and &quot;Wrath of Ashardalon&quot;), which are still simplified versions of the D&amp;D rules set using tile-based game boards and miniatures.<br/><br/>The box cover of this version says &quot;2-5 players&quot;, but there are enough included materials for 6 players (5 pre-generated Player-Characters, and one Dungeon Master.)<br/><br/>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Starter Sets:<br/>2nd Edition: The New Easy to Master Dungeons & Dragons and Introduction to Advanced Dungeons & Dragons<br/>3rd Edition/3.5 Dungeons & Dragons Basic Game<br/>4th Edition: Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set<br/><br/>5th edition is an RPG item: Dungeons & Dragons Starter Set<br/><br/>",

Each turn, you&rsquo;ll send one drowsy patron up to their room, then check to make sure all your patrons are sleeping soundly. If something&rsquo;s irking them, they might raise a fuss, so keep an eye on what they need as you go. Afterwards, you&rsquo;ll usher in more guests and keep an eye on the bar to make sure there&rsquo;s no trouble. There&rsquo;s never a moment to rest in The Ugly Gryphon Inn!<br/><br/>After you've run out of cards in the deck, then count how many patrons you have in the inn. Do not include patrons in the bar.

The players are buying shares on a growing stock market, but at one time in the game the prices will crash. The players try to find out the right time to sell their shares and buy gold and silver (these are the victory points), before the market crashes.<br/><br/>The actions of all players change the probability of the crash. When they start selling, the probability of the crash will get higher. If they only buy shares then the crash will come later.<br/><br/>To win the game, you have to have a close look at what the others do to be in the position to sell the highest share at the right time, to get the most money. But the silver/gold price will rise too, and you can also win by buying silver/gold early in the game.<br/><br/>This game is the first game in the Freitag-Projekt:<br/><br/>Freitag(Friday)  is a game project started on Friday 24th of October in Essen.

Unlike standard Settlers, the game layout is not modular.  Instead the board features a split map, half of which has the goods-producing hexes of a conventional Settlers game where settlements will be built and the other half showing a closeup of N&uuml;rnberg where &quot;workshops&quot; will be built (in lieu of promoting settlements to cities as in the original Settlers).  The players also get currency for manufactured goods which in turn they spend on walls and towers to surround the city, which earn prestige points which ultimately count toward victory points.  Probably the most interesting other detail is that instead of rolling dice, a special deck of cards is used to reveal the production number -- and possibly an event -- at the beginning of each player's turn.<br/><br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On August 3rd, 1943, less than two weeks after the Kursk offensive, the Soviets launched a massive offensive near Kharkov that ripped open the German line. The ensuing battle began their summer offensive that would take them across the Ukraine to the Dnieper River.<br/>During August the two sides were equally matched and a tremendous war of attrition raged from Kharkov to the Sea of Azov with neither side willing to give ground. In September, bled white by the never-ending Soviet attacks, the German army retreated in haste to the safety of the Dnieper River. In October, the battle raged along the length of the Dnieper and for the Perekop Peninsula, the only land exit to the German 17th Army in the Crimea. During this three month period German reinforcements poured in from every sector, but it was never enough. Three Soviet Tank Armies and four Soviet Fronts ground through nineteen panzer and panzergrenadier divisions. German and Soviet losses were staggering. Kiev, the capital of the Ukraine, fell on November 6th.<br/><br/><br/>[1st edition]<br/><br/>Ukraine '43 attempts to simulate this important campaign in a moderately complex game. The design uses the conventional move-fight-exploit sequence of play and the popular Zone of Control Bond rules. Soviet tank armies and German panzer corps spearhead constant attacks and counterattacks. With both sides able to attack, the game becomes a tense battle of skill and nerves.<br/> Game Features:<br/><br/>        German Panzer Corps/Russian Tank Army capabilities<br/>        Soviet massed artillery<br/>        German tactical proficiency<br/>        German Tiger tanks<br/>        Soviet sappers<br/>        air power<br/>        differing capabilities for Marshal Zhukov and General Manstein<br/>        Zone of Control Bonds <br/><br/><br/>COMPONENTS (1st edition)<br/><br/>    280 1/2&quot; full-color counters<br/>    One One 22x29&quot; full-color mapsheet and one 5x29&quot; full-color mapsheet which form a 26.75 x 29&rdquo; map<br/>    32-page Rule Book<br/>    2 full-color 11x17 Player Aid Cards<br/>    1 8.5x11 Sequence of Play Card (w/ Historical Setup on the reverse side!)<br/>    Three 6-sided dice <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>[2nd Edition]The 2nd Edition has been re-designed to play much faster using the system used in France '40 and Normandy '44.

As an influential citizen of Valpara&iacute;so, you want to push the development of your city, so you send merchants into the hinterland to get hold of important export goods and send your ships overseas to gain new achievements there.<br/><br/>To do well in Valpara&iacute;so, you must plan well ahead, keep an eye on your opponents, and react to their actions at short notice. Almost any action influences the other players by changing costs or trading possibilities. Each building of a house must be given a lot of thought, every trade must be well-timed. Whoever wants to change the order of their initial planning during the course of the game must pay a penalty, but if your plans aren't good enough, time will slip away &mdash; in the short run as well as in the long run. You all plan simultaneously, and the end of the game may come sooner than you've hoped!<br/><br/>For advanced players who like planning while pressed for time, the game includes a variant using a sand timer.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Well, that's neither here nor there for now &ndash; let's get out there and free her from the enchanted tower.<br/><br/>In Der verzauberte Turm, one player plays the sorcerer and at the start of the game he hides a key under one of 16 spaces on the game board. The other players collectively take the part of Robin, who tries to find the key before the sorcerer can reach it. No matter who finds the key first, though, that player gets to try the key in one of the six locks on the tower; if he chooses the right one, the princess jumps free of the tower and that player wins. If not, the sorcerer hides the key once again, and everyone moves back to their starting locations.<br/><br/>The sorcerer starts the game on a supplementary movement board that takes him eight spaces to cover, giving Robin time to search various locations first for the key. (Robin and the sorceror are apparently magnetized, and when the character passes over the key location, the key will &quot;clack&quot; to its underside.) How do the pieces move? Each turn the sorcerer rolls a symbol die that shows which character moves first that turn; the Robin players take turns rolling a number die, which has values for both Robin and the sorcerer. Thus, they jockey back and forth to reach a location that only the sorcerer knows. Will the princess find freedom once again, at least for a little while?<br/><br/>",

All Unit data is included on the full-color Data Cards. The streamlined chit-based command system moves the action along at a brisk pace.<br/><br/>The base game comes with 10 Scenarios, some of which are aimed at new players and use only the Basic rules.

The idea for this and future volumes is that we will take multiple existing games from the VPG Napeoleonic 20 series, add an as-yet-unpublished game to the mix, and create a GMT boxed game with 3-4 games in the box, using larger (3/4&quot;) counters and GMT production.<br/><br/>The Napoleonic 20 game system from Victory Point Games features lower-level wargame complexity on maps where, generally, 20 pieces or fewer are in play at one time (total, for both sides).  This creates tense, dramatic and fast-playing situations on the board where higher echelon troop formations (generally corps) vie for position and dominance. Subscribers to C3i have recently enjoyed Jena 20, a game in this series which features eight pages of Standard rules and one-to-two pages of exclusive rules per title.<br/> Veteran game designer Joe Miranda, with developers Alan Emrich and Lance McMillan, have created and refined a highly popular game series that is growing all the time. (Based on Joe's series rules, Alan, Lance, and Steve Carey have each designed one of the games in this multi-pack - in addition to Joe's Waterloo game.) A hallmark feature is the use of narrative random event cards that help &ldquo;tell the stories&rdquo; unique to each battle and small campaign. This &ldquo;friction of war&rdquo; element, combined with the operational-level maneuvers, combat, and even lulls, provide players a fun exercise in the Napoleonic parry-and-thrust of grand battles as armies close to bayonet-point to see which will break first.<br/><br/>This edition includes the latest version (3.0) of the Standard series rules.<br/> Morale plays an vital role, as both sides can &lsquo;spend&rsquo; this resource to force march their units, help rally stragglers, or commit reserves to a key attack or defense. But look out&hellip; when a side&rsquo;s morale is reduced to zero, it has lost the game!<br/><br/>Included in this Multi-Pack are:<br/><br/><br/>    Salamanca 20 (Wellington vs. Marmont, 1812)<br/>    Smolensk 20 (Napoleon vs. Barclay de Tolly in the near-battle to decide the Russian Campaign, 1812)<br/>    Borodino 20 (Napoleon vs. Kutusov before Moscow, 1812)<br/>    Waterloo 20 (Napoleon vs. Blucher and Wellington, 1815) <br/><br/><br/>Game Components:<br/><br/><br/>    Four 17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; mounted  maps (2 boards, backprinted)<br/>    117  3/4&quot;  Counters (thick, with Rounded corners, like No Retreat)<br/>    48 Event cards (12 for each game)<br/>    One 8-page Standard Rules booklet<br/>    4 Exclusive Rules sheets<br/>    One Player&rsquo;s Aid mat<br/>    Two Player Aid charts<br/>    2 six-sided Dice<br/><br/><br/>DESIGN: Joe Miranda<br/>DEVELOPER: Alan Emrich &amp; Lance McMillan<br/>ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

        "description": "You have an invitation at 5 p.m. at the Mad Hatter&rsquo;s garden. The table is ready, the cookies taste like buttery heaven, and the tea is strong and spicy. &quot;More sugar?&quot; asks the Mad Hatter, giving you a bizarre look.<br/><br/>&quot;Yes, plea...&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Time's up!&quot; he yells, interrupting you. Sugar, cookies, and millions of hats fly everywhere. Tea spills all over the tablecloth as he proceeds with a huge smile on his face. &quot;It's time to play a game.&quot;<br/><br/>&bull;&bull;&bull;<br/><br/>In Hats, two to four players compete to acquire the most outstanding hats by exchanging cards in hand with cards on the tea table board. Each card exchange influences how each hat is scored. Naturally, at the end of the game, the player with the highest score will be declared the maddest!<br/><br/>To play, everyone draws nine cards. You take your turn by performing one of the following two actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Exchange hats &mdash; Play a single card from your hand face up and exchange it with one of the same type (color) from the tea table board or exchange it for a card of any type but of a lower value. Add the card exchanged from the tea table board to your collection by placing it face up in front of you.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Create a black hat &mdash; Play a single card face down in front of you to add it to your collection as a black hat. Each black hat in a player's collection at game's end is worth 1 point.<br/><br/><br/>Optional action: At any time during your turn, you may discard a single card of your choice to draw a new one from the draw deck. In a four-player game, players will exchange cards with their teammates.<br/><br/>END GAME SCORING<br/><br/>Hat Collection: Players earn points for the hat cards in their collection based on the position of the matching type on the tea table board. If two or more hat cards on the tea table board are of the same type, find the hat card of that type with the lowest position on the tea table board and keep it face up, while turning all other cards of that type face down.<br/><br/>Favorite Hat: Each player reveals the final card in their hand as their &quot;favorite hat&quot; type. Players gain points equal to the sum of all cards in their collection that match the type of their &quot;favorite hat&quot; minus the value of the final card in their hand.<br/><br/>The Last Cookie: There is only one cookie left at the table. Players compete for the cookie by having the most different types of hat cards in their collection. Black hats count as a type. During the game, pass the cookie to the player who has the most different types of hat cards. The chocolate chip cookie is worth five points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

It's the fifth stand-alone game in the series that introduces new twists to Valeria world!<br/><br/>You are a Margrave, a military commander tasked with defending the land of Valeria and building magical Ward Towers at cities.  Knights in Valeria can be commanded by you or your fellow Margraves to slay monsters or activate locations in an effort to gain influence over the 4 Guilds: Worker, Soldier, Shadow, and Holy. As you gain influence, you'll cross thresholds that will earn you privilege tiles which give you bonuses.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, you'll earn victory points based on how much influence you have over a Guild and how many icons you've gained of that Guild. The Margrave with the most victory points at the end of the game will be named a Duke or Duchess and given their own province to protect and grow!<br/><br/>Turns are deceptively simple as you only get to play 1 Citizen card from your hand. Each card can be played for action icons in the pennant (top-left), power text (at the bottom), or played face-down to perform one of the two actions on your player board (Recall your cards or Build a Ward Tower).<br/><br/>Key features include:<br/><br/><br/>    Hand Building - Much like deck-building, you are drafting cards into your hand increasing your powers, victory points, and options.  <br/>    Multi-use Cards - Each card can be used in one of four ways, leaving you a lot of decision-making room to execute your strategy.<br/>    Worker-Placement - Each time you move your Margrave or a Knight into a location, you activate the power of that location much like a worker placement game. <br/>    Shared Workers - The Knights on the game board do not belong to a single player (anyone can use them) so be careful not to setup your opponents with powerful turns.<br/>    Resource Management - You have limited storage spots on your player board and using them effectively (without wasting tokens) is key to winning the game. <br/>    Hero Tombs - As you send Knights into battle, they die glorious deaths and are sent to tombs where you can collect bonuses in a well-integrated mini-game.<br/>    Influence Track - Gain influence over the 4 Guilds by moving your markers across the tracks which will earn you more victory points at the end of the game for icons you collect.<br/>    Fantastic Art - As with previous Valeria games, the Mico has really outdone himself by creating a rich and dynamic world full of color and life.<br/><br/><br/>",

It's a heavy weight filler! A compressed and easy to understand set of rules, combined with cards that you can play in more than one way is what makes this game great! Fifteen minutes is all it takes for you and your friends to set out on an exciting adventure in space!<br/><br/>In the world of big games about Mars everybody should have one that fits in their pocket.<br/><br/>Your goal is to place as many colonists as you can in the buildings of your Mars settlement. To do so, you will need to choose carefully how and when to play your cards.<br/><br/>The way you trigger actions on your cards is the heart of the game. Everything depends on where you play them from, which is the game's main strategic element. You could play a project card straight from your hand and trigger its effect instantly or turn it into a module and play it from your preparation zone. This will let you add it to one of the five buildings in your settlement, trigger an action sequence and transport your colonists to Mars &ndash; a sure way to put a spanner in the works of your competition.<br/>Each card's set of various actions combined with the buildings' unique properties leaves you with a number of small but substantial decisions:<br/><br/>&minus; Where to put your card.<br/>&minus; Where to play your card from.<br/>&minus; What action sequence will give you the most possibilities within a given turn.<br/><br/>What's more, anyone can activate an action from a module placed in one of the buildings by another player and share its effects.<br/><br/>Pocket Mars may be a small game but Michał Jagodziński sure stuffed it with a lot of options that will have an impact on the survival of our civilization! :)<br/><br/>",

The wound system no longer counts down from a wound total instead players will gain wounds as the day goes on. This has removed player elimination so no player is out of the game until the very end.<br/><br/>The dungeon set up has also changed in this new edition. No longer do players have to shuffle half the face up into the half face down. It is now based on a separate dungeon deck that shows players which cards to have face up, and which cards will be face down.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game was designed by Stefan Feld and is for 2-5 players ages 9 and up and plays in 60-75 minutes. On the Alea complexity scale of 1 (simple) to 10 (difficult), this game rates a 2. (Editor's Note: That is the same complexity as Chinatown, Wyatt Earp, and Edel, Stein & Reich)<br/><br/>The players take on the roles of freebooters who, back in their pirates' hideout, spend their time with all kinds of competitions - drinking, fighting, etc. All players move the main playing figure, the captain, through the alleys of the village, with the goal of gaining as much rum and reknown as possible. The end of each of the five rounds is also marked by a highly variable fight to claim the best sleeping spaces on board the ship (bed or board?). The game is a mixture of tactics, strategy, and luck. The die plays an important role in the game, but you still get the feeling of being at the mercy of fate only rarely.<br/><br/>The game contains 76 plastic pirate figures, 9 game board pieces that ensure the board is always different, about 200 tiles, and 1 die.<br/><br/>-description adapted from the Gamewire Essen Preview.<br/><br/>This game is #10 in the Alea big box series.<br/><br/>",

Collect resources from lands under your control, using them to build up your cities and fortifications. Some building types provide several ways for you to gain important in-game advantages, while others enhance your military strength or simply score you victory points. As you expand your territory, you will lay claim to noble titles, acquire new technologies, and train your military units. Each region and leader offer asymmetrical choices with their unique abilities.<br/><br/>Dark Ages is actually two games: Western Europe (subtitled Heritage of Charlemagne) and Central Europe (subtitled Holy Roman Empire). While both versions feature identical gameplay, each focuses its attention on a specific part of Europe during the Dark Ages (Western and Central, respectively). As a result, the game board maps differ between the two versions, as do the lands in which players vie for control over along with the flavor of the inhabitants and leaders of those lands. However, by combining both versions, you can enlarge the map into an epic battle for superiority for five or more players!<br/><br/>Each game box is filled with finely sculpted miniatures of cities, fortresses, farms, and other buildings. The different types of troops &mdash; infantry, bowmen, and cavalry &mdash; are represented by unique miniatures.<br/><br/>The solo mode for Dark Ages has been designed by D&aacute;vid Turczi.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Skies Above the Reich is a solitaire game depicting a Luftwaffe squadron of Bf109s struggling to deter and destroy the relentless daylight raids over Germany during World War Two. The player&rsquo;s individual aircraft, each represented by a stickered block, must confront the mighty &ldquo;combat box&rdquo; formation of the United States Army Air Force,  a deadly terrain of B-17 Flying Fortresses. The game is a broad strokes depiction that presents the arc of the desperate air war. Stretching from late 1942 to early 1945, Skies Above the Reich follows that trajectory in a series of missions strung together to make a campaign. Each mission will take a half hour or more to play, while a campaign can last anywhere between 6 to 60 missions.<br/><br/>The Mission<br/>You select pilots and &ldquo;attachments,&rdquo; such as gun pods, rockets, or added armor. You may also augment your attack with auxiliary aircraft such as Ju88s, Fw190s, or later in the war, jet propelled Me262s, the answer to the deadly P-51 escort fighter. Time in a mission is limited, so you must do your best to wreck the bomber formation as quickly as possible, while bringing home as many pilots as you can in order to muster a force for the next mission.<br/>The mission is played on a formation map that depicts as many as twenty-one B-17 bombers in a tight array. The game comes with two double-sided map boards (four maps in all) that as a set chronicle the development and increasing lethality of the bomber formation. Each map is a bigger and more lethal terrain than its predecessor.<br/>Will you strike the formation from the nose or from the tail?  Will your fighters make a dead-level attack or will they drop bombs on the formation from above? Will you split your squadron to attack from multiple angles, or will they charge at the bombers in successive waves? Will you even have time for this kind of maneuver?<br/>What if you encounter the bombers&rsquo; &ldquo;little friends,&rdquo; fighter escort lurking nearby? How will you handle them if you do, or will you even try? Will you organize part of your force to tangle with escort, or will you arm your entire contingent to focus on the bombers?<br/><br/>The Campaign<br/>As tough as each mission can be, the real challenge is the campaign where you watch as your roster of pilots gradually shrinks. Some pilots will survive long enough to acquire ace skills, but you will be forced to replace downed or wounded pilots, and those young newcomers come &ldquo;green&rdquo;. Some campaigns will end simply because you run out of pilots.<br/>Full Campaigns follow the chronology of &ldquo;seasons,&rdquo; each comprising a number of missions that your squadron flies striving to disrupt the American bomber raids. In a full campaign you must endure all seven seasons, keeping your squadron intact while making an impact on the relentless wave of bomber formations roaring over your homeland. A short campaign challenges you to win a single season, although you may wish to extend it to a second or third season depending on how well you fare.<br/>Each season represents a distinct period of the war, as the campaign traverses the history of the air war. Bombers become more heavily armed but so too do your own Bf109 fighters. Early seasons are characterized by smaller formations, while seasons in the middle of the war are notable for the lack of fighter escort. And later seasons will put the squeeze on your squadron.<br/><br/>Basic and Advanced Games<br/>In the basic game your goal is to knock bombers out of formation, or destroy them outright. The advanced game adds &ldquo;pursuit&rdquo; where you dispatch fighters to chase after and intercept bombers knocked out of the formation. Played out on an 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; map depicting a single bomber, pursuit makes the advanced game even more challenging.<br/><br/>The Two Player Game<br/>You may also play this as a (un)cooperative game. Players each command a squadron of fighters and attack a formation of bombers together. Although players may lose together, even if they win the campaign only one of them may be declared the victor.<br/><br/>&quot;No one who experienced them will ever forget them &ndash; those streams of Flying Fortresses. Suddenly we saw [them] ahead in a great swarm. I confess the sight put me into a bit of a flap, and the others felt the same. We seemed so puny against these four-engined giants. Then we attacked from the beam.&quot;                                                                &ndash; Cajus Bekker, The Luftwaffe War Diaries<br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     Each turn = seconds and minutes<br/>MAP SCALE:     Area movement<br/>UNIT SCALE:     Individual fighters<br/>NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     1 - 4<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/><br/>        17&rdquo; x 22&rdquo; map board (double sided)<br/>        22&rdquo; x 34&rdquo; map board (double sided)<br/>        Pilot Roster Pad<br/>        Three Player Aid Cards<br/>        Rulebook<br/>        Situation Manual<br/>        Two ten-sided dice <br/><br/><br/>(from GMT webpage)<br/><br/>",

Game play is fast and intense - does a good job of creating the sense of urgency felt when watching the movie. Missions can be made more brutal with optional rules - plus some rule variants add to some fun &quot;what if&quot; scenarios.

        "description": "Space Hulk is a game of tactical combat between Imperial Space Marines and alien creatures known as Genestealers.  The combat takes place on derelict, alien infested space vessels know as space hulks.<br/><br/>Combat is action point driven and resolved through the use of dice.  The marines have a finite number of figures to use in combat against endless hoards of Genestealers.  The object is to accomplish given missions within their parameters or die trying.<br/><br/>There were significant differences between the 1st edition and this one.  The first being that this version or revision was by Dean Bass and Chris Colston and based on the original game by Richard Halliwell and Paul Murphy.  The most significant difference in this version was the removal of the sand timer and thus the requirement for the marines to accomplish their turn in a limited real-time period. Also the rules of the 2nd edition did not allow the player of the Space Marines to perform actions by using command points in the turn of the Genestealer player.  Another change was the addition of combat specific dice to resolve weapons fire and a special die to resolve gun jams.  A few other minor changes were made to the rules and board graphics as well.<br/><br/>This version contains the initial six missions found in the first edition and adds an additional 12 missions which were different than those in the 1st edition of the Deathwing and Genestealer expansions.<br/><br/>Digitally redeveloped into Alien Assault<br/><br/>",

When the game ends, players receive additional points for their Ship Tiles.<br/><br/>In Advanced Mode, Objectives are split in 2 types of cards which allows you to create your own objectives amongst many combinations.<br/><br/>There is also a Solo Mode, innovative for its mechanics as well as for the very concept of a solo mode in a tile-placement game.

This is the Gamewright version.<br/><br/>1996 Mensa Select<br/><br/>Republished 2002 by Amigo as Biberbande:<br/><br/>Biberbande is a card game for Ages 6 and up, the object of which is to improve your initial unknown 4-card hand so that you have a lower sum of cards than the other players. There are 66 cards in the deck, which consists of ranks 0-9 (four of ranks 0-8 and nine 9's) and 3 different types of action cards (9 &quot;Exchange&quot;, 7 &quot;Spy&quot;, and 5 &quot;2 X draw&quot;). Four cards are dealt face down to each player so that no player knows the values of her cards. The four cards are then arranged in a row and each player may briefly look at her outer two cards. A player's turn consists of drawing a card from the top of the draw pile or discard pile. If the player drew from the draw pile, there are several possible actions: If it is a number card, she may replace one of her face down cards with it (placing it face down) or she may simply discard it. If it is an action card, she may carry out the action or ignore the action. If a player draws the top card of the discard pile, she must replace one of her face down cards with it (placed face down). A player may knock at the end of her turn meaning that each other player has one more turn before the round is over. When the round ends, players turn over their cards and add up their values. The player with the lowest total value wins. Generally the game is played with as many rounds as there are players. Player interaction comes in the form of the action cards. The 'Exchange' card allows a player to exchange one of his cards with one of his opponents. The 'Spy' card allows a player to look at one of his own cards. Finally the &quot;2X look&quot; card allows a player to look at the top card of the draw pile, then keep it or throw it away. If she throws it away, she must use the next card in the draw pile.<br/><br/>",

To achieve your goals and to gain honor, you will have to overcome your adversaries in terrifying bloody battles, by holding in respect the other clans grace, honoring hostages or alliances.<br/><br/>Every turn of the game is divided into three phases:<br/><br/><br/>     Diplomatic Phase, where you will be able to exchange military advantages (which make it possible to decrease the randomness of the engagements), to trade and acquire hostages (thanks to whom you will be able to pressure  your adversaries at the time of the engagements).<br/>     Order Phase, where you will place orders on the territories which you occupy. There are three types of orders:  movement, production and raising troops.<br/>     Action Phase, where the honor is of utmost importance. The player with the most honor hosts the Emperor.<br/><br/><br/>And that enables him to choose in which order the territories and corresponding orders will be processed.<br/><br/>You may well imagine, that combats are frequent. One player then rolls 9 dice (whose faces are decorated with the symbols of each clan) whose results are then modified by the  bonus acquired during the diplomatic phase. Only the attacker (and only when victorious obviously) can acquire Prestige (points of honor) due to the engagements. This honor is proportional to the troops vanquished at the time of the conflict. The more deaths there are, the more honor there is!<br/><br/>",

As Viking shipwrights, players compete to construct the greatest fleet on the North Sea. Players must collect oak, wool, and iron, as well as getting other craftspeople on board to help. Gold is a precious commodity, and must be spent wisely. As you would expect, the township is filled with an array of characters, bad and worse. Better hope they&rsquo;re on your side!<br/><br/>The aim of Shipwrights of the North Sea: Redux is to be the player with the most Victory Points (VP) at the game&rsquo;s end. Points are gained by constructing Longships and Buildings, recruiting Jarls, attracting Heroes, and collecting Gold. Over the course of 5 Rounds, players will draft Village Cards, and must carefully manage their resources and workforce to set their settlement apart as the most glorious amongst all the clans.<br/><br/>Redux Version:<br/>Shipwrights of the North Sea: Redux is an entirely new game. While it shares a lot of thematic elements and player goals from the original, the core gameplay has been completely rebuilt to create an experience much more in line with what fans of Garphill Games have come to expect.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

It is played on a board with maze tiles (straight, L, and T shaped corridors) randomly arranged on it.  Players are represented on the board by little wizard pawns.  Players are wizards-in-training, and they are charged with exploring the maze and finding all the ingredients (numbered chips) needed to become a Wizard.  The trick is that chips must be claimed in numerical order.  Perhaps the most novel aspect of this game is that players mutate the maze by sliding a tile onto the board from the side, which hopefully will enable them to travel to the next ingredient.  Once all twenty-one items have been claimed, the highest total score wins, but each player also holds a secret recipe worth bonus points if they were able to capture three specific ingredients.<br/><br/>",

During this period, Francesco D'Assisi writes his famous Canticle of the Sun and Dante writes the Divine Comedy, both written in Volgare.<br/><br/>In De Vulgari Eloquentia, players have to do their part in the creation of this new language! But who will provide them the proper knowledge to understand the manuscripts in the different dialects? Who will successfully uncover the secrets of the books inside the Papal Library? Who will embrace the religious life, and who will remain a merchant? Some of the players can become a famous banker, someone else can climb the church's hierarchy to be the next Pope! But in the end, who will be the most appreciated and respected for their status and culture?<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to obtain more Volgare points. The players gain VP from reading manuscripts and looking for important documents like the Canticle of the Sun or &quot;The Riddle from Verona&quot;. Players can also gain VP by improving their social status, for example, if the merchant becomes a banker or the Friar becomes a Benedictine Monk or the Cardinal becomes Camerlengo or Pope. Moreover, VP can be gotten with money and with the support of Politicians, Noblemen, Abbesses, and the Amanuensis.<br/><br/>This is a totally new re-designed edition of&nbsp;De Vulgari Eloquentia which features new mechanisms and new elements.

        "description": "The holiday-themed 12 Days takes the familiar &quot;Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; song and twists it into a quick-playing card game. Over twelve rounds, players try to re-gift unpopular cards while keeping cards that are strong enough to win the day, while also keeping a careful eye for bonus scoring at the end of the game.<br/><br/>The gift deck consists of eighty cards: one partridge in a pear tree, two turtle doves, and so on up to twelve drummers drumming, as well as one card each for Mr. and Mrs. Claus. Shuffle this deck, then deal each player twelve cards. Each round a new holiday card is up for grabs, with the cards ranked from 1 to 12 and being worth 1-12 points. In a round, a player:<br/><br/><br/>     Gifts a present to the player to his left,<br/>     Opens presents and tries to win the day with the best present, and<br/>     Buys a new gift to refill his hand.<br/><br/><br/>More specifically, all players simultaneously pass one face-down gift card to their left-hand neighbor. Then everyone chooses one gift card in hand and reveals them simultaneously. Whoever plays the lowest gift card wins that round's holiday card; in the event of a tie for lowest, with the Clauses counting as zero, then the next lowest card wins. Each player then draws one card to bring their hand back to twelve cards.<br/><br/>After twelve rounds, players score points for each holiday card they've collected. In addition, whoever holds the most gift cards for each rank scores as many points as that rank, with all tied players scoring in the event of a tie. Whoever has the most points wins. Happy holidays!<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to have the highest remaining Morale when an opposing warband's Morale has been reduced to 0 or below, or if a player ends his or her turn with no creatures on the battlefield.<br/><br/>As a player, you take on the role of a commander, sending a warband to battle the forces arrayed against you. You recruit troops and deploy them on the battlefield. You issue orders to those creatures, outfit them with spells and equipment, and direct their tactics to break the morale of your enemies and drive them from the field.<br/><br/>Dungeon Command: Tyranny of Goblins includes twelve miniatures, such as a horned devil, a troll, a bugbear, hobgoblins, and goblins. While each Dungeon Command faction is meant to be played by a single player, quick-start rules allow two players to engage in a shortened version of the game using only one box. Dungeon Command is designed for two players, although up to four can play with a few adjustments explained under the advanced rules.<br/><br/>Integratable with:<br/><br/>    Dungeon Command: Blood of Gruumsh<br/>    Dungeon Command: Curse of Undeath<br/>    Dungeon Command: Heart of Cormyr<br/>    Dungeon Command: Sting of Lolth<br/><br/><br/>Can also integrate with:<br/><br/>    Dungeons & Dragons: Castle Ravenloft Board Game<br/>    Dungeons & Dragons: The Legend of Drizzt Board Game<br/>    Dungeons & Dragons: Wrath of Ashardalon Board Game<br/>    Dungeons & Dragons: Temple of Elemental Evil Board Game<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Salton Sea is a unique place located in California, very close to the border with Mexico. The characteristics of this salty lake make it a unique location to generate geothermal energy, which takes advantage of the heat from the planet. In this area of intense geothermal activity, you will drill the ground and extract brine which, once processed, allows us to obtain the valuable lithium and sell it as part of a modern industry, far from fossil fuels, that will allow you to lead the energy transition towards a completely renewable future.<br/><br/>Designed by David Bernal and illustrated by Amelia Sales, Salton Sea can be enjoyed alone or in groups of up to four players in sessions lasting about 120 minutes. During the game, players must manage their geothermal lithium extraction companies to obtain the greatest number of points. The extraction of this material and its subsequent processing will be the driving force of your companies.<br/><br/>On your turn, place one of your four engineers on one of the available spaces to take an action. There are three different groups of actions: industrial actions (which allow you to obtain an exploration license, drill, extract, process or repair machinery), commercial actions (sell, acquire contract and execute contract), and management actions (research, buy shares, develop the business project or finance itself). It is up to you to manage the engineers at each point of the game to get the most out of your company.<br/><br/>However, there is no single path to success. The game will reward you for exhausted land, executed contracts, short-term objectives, company development, or research advances. Will you master the power of the Salton Sea to create the most efficient geothermal company?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The number of squares you can move on a turn is the number of empty spaces in your backpack, so the lighter you travel, the faster.<br/><br/>In the beginning, only 13 tiles (two legs of a 7x7 square) are on the table, and everybody starts in the corner with three fish (provisions) and two pearl necklaces (trading goods).  One thing to do on your turn is &quot;explore,&quot; adding a randomly drawn tile next to the one where your pawn currently stands.  The board gradually fills in to the point where the tile at the opposite corner from the start is drawn, and this tile is designated the site of the lost temple and pays bonuses for everyone who reaches it.  The sooner you get there, the better the bonuses.<br/><br/>About half the squares are free to enter and let you obtain other items for your backpack.  If you're already carrying a fishing pole, for example, in some squares you'll be able to pick up more fish.  The other half are &quot;adventure&quot; tiles that require the expenditure of backpack items in order to gain entry.  You might have to spend two rifles, for example, to enter a wildcat tile; then you place a &quot;camp&quot; marker and can enter that tile for free in the future.  A lot of the game involves going back and forth to tiles where you can assemble the necessary items to work your way through the adventure tiles to the lost temple.<br/><br/>Goldland appeals to puzzle-solvers and has a fun atmosphere of exploring the wilderness in search of El Dorado.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description courtesy of BoardgameNews.com<br/><br/>After the Flood &ndash; a three-player game that&rsquo;s set in Sumeria, with players using regional resources to trade for goods not produced in the area while also building short-lived empires for long-lasting victory points.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Certain mechanisms were created with three players in mind,&rdquo; says Wallace. &ldquo;You score an empire, then remove it, so you can try to maximize points on your turn without leaving yourself in a position to get hit on following turns.&rdquo; This design sidesteps the problem of a third player winning a game due to fights to the death by players 1 and 2, but that bug becomes a feature in another part of the game. Competition among the players for goods and army strength is relative rather than linear; having twice as many dudes collecting resources won&rsquo;t net you twice the number of goods, so getting into an arms race with one opponent might hurt the two of you together and advantage the third player who can spend resources on better things.<br/><br/>Controlling different cities gives you different bonuses, with the bonus being based on the history of the city itself: Sippar lets you trade more, Babylon counts for additional armies, and so forth. Combat in the game is dice-based to avoid deterministic battles in which you can guarantee victory simply by piling up more troops, although size does have its advantages.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Like Wallace's other games Libert&eacute; and Byzantium, players don't represent a particular faction/nation. Instead, the game covers a long period of history (~1500 years in this case) and players temporarily control empires as they rise and fall. Score VP at the end of each turn (~350 years) when the empires fall. Players start with several resources and 2 workers in their available stock, and workers in the irrigation and weaving boxes. Each turn follows the same steps:1. Collect Resources (grain and textiles) based on relative rank of workers in the irrigation/weaving. Then take 8 workers to available stock (total 10 at start of game). Move all workers in Scribes and Toolmakers to the left (and &quot;Unused&quot;) side.<br/><br/>2. Decline (turns 2 and 4 ONLY): each player removes all workers from Dilmun, and 1 from every non-Sumerian region. In the Irrigation and Weaving boxes, the player with the most workers reduces their number TO 2 (with n being the number of workers they returned to supply). The other players remove n workers. Finally, each removes 1 worker from the Scribes and Toolmakers boxes.<br/><br/>3. Player Actions. In turn order (random at start of game), take 1 action. If anyone has passed, you must discard one item (resource, worker, or army) from your available stock to take an action. Continue rotating in turn order till all 3 pass. Action Choices:<br/>- Build City. Place one of your city markers in Sumerian region with no other city there. Most give you a special power. If all 4 out, may destroy old city to build new one.<br/>- Place Workers. Spend a resource of value x; place up to x workers in ONE location (Scribe box: max 2 workers/player). In addition, or instead, may use each unused scribe to move or place a worker.<br/>- Trade. Each worker is allowed to trade 1 resource for 1 of the resource(s) available in their region. Each region only provides 1 of each resource present there. However, if ANY army is in the region, workers cannot do anything. Each army, though, can conduct 1 trade just like a worker. In addition, or instead, you can use worker(s) in the Toolmakers box to convert metal to Tools (1/worker).<br/>- Start Empire. 3 available each turn, 1/player. Each has designated start region (2 Sumerian empires -- may start anywhere in Sumer). You must have equal or greater number of workers than any other single player in their home region (except Sumerian empires: no workers needed). Take designated # armies into available stock; may buy more (pay resource(s)). Also, may equip (spend resources; rank by value relative to what other already created empires spent). Then come onto board: if enemy army there, fight. Otherwise (or once enemy killed), place 1 or 2 armies in starting region.<br/>- Expand Empire.<br/>... <i>Place Army</i> token (from available stock) to adjacent region. If enemy army present, fight.<br/>... <i>Destroy City</i>. If have army in region with enemy city, discard 2 from supply to destroy it -- return to supply.<br/>... <i>Reinforce Region</i>: place 2nd army into a region (max 2/region).<br/>... After any choice above, may discard 1 army from supply to Expand again.<br/>Fighting<br/>Attacker rolls 2d6. If better equipped than defender, kills on 5+. Otherwise, need 7+. May continue attacking until decide to end battle, or win and place 1 army in new region (all considered 1 attack; i.e., don't need to discard an army to continue the fight).<br/>- Pass. May opt to discard resource(s) as well.<br/><br/>4. Determine Turn Order. Based on resources discarded when passing: most--&gt;least first--&gt;third. If tied, retain relative turn order.<br/><br/>5. Score VP. 2VP/region with your army token. Then in turn order, decide whether or not to improve your cities: each requires discarding 2 wood + 0-4 resources (earn 3-18 VP). If improved, place marker on city -- it won't score again.<br/><br/>6. Reset. Remove all armies from board. Remove all armies and workers from available stock. Advance turn marker.<br/><br/>End of Game<br/>- After end of turn 5.<br/>- Final scoring: player with most <i>workers</i> in each region scores VP shown on board.<br/>- Most VP wins. Tiebreaker = turn order.<br/><br/>",

This trick taking game features ultra simple rules for an absolutely addictive play experience.<br/><br/>Goal of the Game: Race to the summit to score as many points as possible and win the covered jersey. To win a race, you must be the first player to get rid of all your cards. Racer cards may be played alone or in specific combinations of the same color or same value. There are also breakaway specialist cards which work alone to speed ahead of the pack.<br/><br/>Victory: The game has 5 rounds, each representing the ascent of a different mountain summit by riders in a cycling race. To win the round, you need to get rid of all of your cards before any other player. Even if you are not the winner, you can still score points for your position. Keep playing until there is only one player left. At the end of each round, the player with the highest points total is the leader and received the coveted jersey. The player who receives the jersey at the end of the last round, after the final scoring, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Will you risk losing everything?<br/><br/>In Dungeon Roll the player's goal is to collect the most experience points by defeating monsters, battling the dragon, and amassing treasure. Each player selects a Hero avatar, such as a Mercenary, Half-Goblin, or Enchantress, which provides them with unique powers. Then players take turns being the Adventurer, who boldly enters the dungeon seeking glory.<br/><br/>The Adventurer assembles their party by rolling seven Party Dice, while another player serves as the Dungeon Lord and rolls a number of Dungeon Dice based on how far the Adventurer has progressed through the dungeon. The Adventurer uses Champion, Fighter, Cleric, Mage, Thief, and Scroll faces on the Party Dice to defeat monsters such as oozes and skeletons, to claim treasure inside chests, and to revive downed companions with potions. The Adventurer claims treasure by taking a token at random from inside the treasure chest-shaped game box.<br/><br/>All this fighting in the dungeon is certain to attract the attention of the boss: The Dragon!<br/><br/>When three or more Dragon faces appear on the Dungeon Dice, the Adventurer must battle the Dragon. Defeating the dragon is a team effort, requiring three different companion types. After three rounds, the players add up their experience points and retire to the inn to celebrate their exploits and to plan their next foray into the next deadly dungeon!<br/><br/>",

Letters score based on which of the 4 columns of the board they're in, and how rare they are.<br/><br/>After the fastest player scores, the first player clockwise scores their word, and compares it to the fastest player. If that player scored more than the fastest player, they score a small bonus.<br/><br/>Every other player scores their word and checks for a bonus. Once they've all done this, the fastest player scores a bonus if their score is equal to or higher than half the other player's scores.<br/><br/>After 7 rounds, players add the scores their best 5 words, plus their bonuses.

Players usually play their cards on their side of the mats, but they may sometimes play on their opponent's side, a move that can ruin their opponent's plans.<br/><br/>Pi&ntilde;ata reimplements Balloon Cup &ndash; while adopting the designer's initial theme for the game &ndash; with the most significant rule changes being the addition of wild cards, the removal of a three-for-one token exchange, and a revision of the card values (but not the card count within each color).

Players compete for points in several hands of play by playing sequential pairs, trips, straights and other card combinations, and whoever has scored the most points once the designated point score has been reached wins.

        "description": "The year is 1917. Russia&rsquo;s Tsar Nicholas II has abdicated and Russia slides toward an ever deepening internal crisis. On the western edge of the vast Russian Empire, the uncertainty in Russia is giving rise to a power vacuum in the semi-autonomous Grand Duchy of Finland. For many across the Finnish political spectrum, the turmoil in Russia looks like an opportunity to fulfill the dream of Finnish national independence. Yet the competing factions are unable to agree on a common political vision for the country. By January 1918, a bloody civil war will have broken out in Finland.<br/><br/>All Bridges Burning recreates the political and military affairs of the Finnish civil war in a new COIN System volume for three players. The Reds seek to stage a working class revolt and then hold onto their gains, while the White Senate forces seek to reassert control. A third, non-violent Social Democratic faction fights for the survival of moderate leftism and political reform. All three factions must keep the national sentiment conciliatory enough for a post-conflict settlement and national independence. In addition, the non-player powers of Germany and Russia offer military assistance to the Senate and the Reds, respectively. Excessive foreign involvement, however, could quash the dream of Finnish independence and prompt a collective loss of all three player factions. Historical events, asymmetrical action menus, as well as extensive historical design notes familiarize the players with the historical period.<br/><br/>A unique sequence of play for three factions poses players &ndash; whether veteran or new to the COIN Series &ndash; fresh challenges in selecting from the asymmetric commands and special activities. The Reds will find themselves needing to split time and resources between competing tasks of solidifying the Red revolt by creating working organs of civilian administration on the one hand, and fighting an increasingly desperate war against a far more powerful enemy on the other. The White Senate faction, in contrast, has a more traditional war to fight. The Senate will want to enhance their military performance by capabilities such as armored trains, cannons, as well as the Finnish, German-trained 27th Jaeger Battalion. Meanwhile the Social Democrats will be focused on building and maintaining underground networks of information, distributing news across the fronts, and advancing a stagnating political process while fending off retributions from the two warring factions.<br/><br/>A simple but effective card-driven non-player system enables the game to be played solitaire as well as in a two-player mode. The structure of the sequence of play, the character of the commands and special activities in the game, the smaller number of players, and compact size combine to enable All Bridges Burning to play fast. The solitaire system has been designed to preserve that speed and fluidity of play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A new 1-4 player cooperative board game by SlugFest Games!<br/><br/>In Tales you will take on the role of one of the famous characters from The Red Dragon Inn series of games as they tackle their day job of being big damn heroes. The multi-scenario campaign pits the players against game-controlled enemies tailor-made for each illustrated fold-out game map. Each scenario will take you to a new map, with new foes and even a few tricky puzzles to solve. You'll need to work together with the other players by equipping hero and item cards to support your allies who have their own unique abilities and roles.<br/><br/>Each scenario has specific objectives, so how you and your party beat each one varies from &quot;kill all the enemies&quot; to &quot;survive X turns&quot; to &quot;protect this thing until something happens&quot; to &quot;get to this room on the map&quot;. All of the players win the scenario together by completing that scenario's final objective. They can also all lose together if any one of them are defeated in combat, or in the case of many scenarios, the enemies complete their own AI-controlled objective.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "International Game Series game from Multi-Man Publishing.<br/><br/>Simulating the Pacific Front of World War II has always been one of the great wargame design challenges. The same distance that planes could cover in a few hours took days for ships and weeks for foot soldiers. Hostile jungles and great oceans combined to make logistics and transport of paramount historical concerns. These and other design puzzles are solvable by only the most gifted designers.<br/><br/>Renowned Japanese wargame designer Tetsuya Nakamura has successfully met these challenges and Multi-Man Publishing is to offer the elegant result - Fire in the Sky. Fire in the Sky has, until now, only been available in Japanese.<br/><br/>With only one map and 180 counters, Fire in the Sky packs years of prior Pacific design attempts and experience into an effort that beautifully distills the essence of the conflict and serves as further proof that great things do indeed come in small packages. Fire in the Sky provides players with the same problems and perspectives faced by the historical combatants, yet does so in a game that can be played in 5 hours or less. The game is ingeniously balanced and so provides not only a look into the minds of the actual commanders, but also a fun, competitive and tense gaming experience.<br/><br/>The game includes glorious 1-inch counters, a clever map that integrates hexes and areas, and rules that cover all of the essential aspects of the Great Pacific War. Oil convoys and troop transports are as vital to victory as the massive Carrier fleets that steam over the vast Pacific. Tetsuya Nakamura&rsquo;s intelligent and ingenious design also offers Western players a fascinating glimpse into the Japanese perspective on the war.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, shuffle the deck, then remove five cards from play unseen. Deal one card face-up to each player.<br/><br/>Whoever has the lowest card is the first active player. She decides whether to &quot;hit&quot; &mdash; that is, be dealt another card &mdash; or forfeit the round. If she hits and is dealt a card that doesn't match a card she already has in front of her, then the next player clockwise becomes the active player; if the card does match, then the round ends, she keeps one of these matching cards as penalty points, then everyone else discards their cards and a new round begins with each player being dealt a card.<br/><br/>If the active player forfeits, the round ends and she takes the lowest-valued card visible on the table as penalty points, then a new round begins. Penalty cards remain set aside, even if the deck is shuffled to continue play. If a player acquires more penalty points than the predetermined threshold, then the game ends and this player loses. (Alternatively, players can use coins to track scores between games, with the loser paying everyone one coin, paying her score in coins to the player with the lowest score, etc.)<br/><br/>There are many versions of Pairs from Cheapass Games. The base game play is identical, but the artwork (and artist) vary across the versions. Some include special game rules relevant to the theme of the deck. In general, you can find new/experimental/user-submitted rules at the Cheapass website, and many non-English versions of Pairs also include rules for additional games to play with this deck.<br/><br/>",

Double-sided Adversaries provide an evolving challenge: face a lower-level Adversary at the end of Act II, then the Final Adversary at the end of Act III. In Campaign Mode, players can unlock new cards by defeating each new Adversary. The game incorporates more rewards for cooperative play while still incentivizing individual achievement.<br/><br/>While points decide the winner of the game, Call To Adventure encourages storytelling at the end of the game. Epic Origins also includes a guide for converting your final tableau into a 5th Edition D&amp;D character.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from designer Michael Schacht (swiped from the Terminal City Gamers site, who in turn got it from Erwin Broens):<br/><br/>You play chronologically in 5 time periods with specific industries and technologies. It is a bidding game. The new bidding system is: You have an auctioneer. He sells several open cards. He decides the selling order (one by one). The others make clockwise just one bid or no bid. The auctioneer can accept the highest bid, take the money, and sell the next card, or the auctioneer can take the card by himself, but then he is no longer the auctioneer (next clockwise is). If no one bids on something, the auctioneer must take the card (that can be hard because money is really short) - so you have to be careful what you sell.<br/><br/>The cards you're bidding on are production places, technologies, resources, and improvements (bonus). After the bidding phase you can build production places and improvements and develop technologies, then you immediately get victory points. For that you need money and resources (mainly from other production places).<br/><br/>Problem: If you build late (next period started) you get less or nothing.<br/><br/>At the end you get extra points for good improvement combinations and production places that work together.<br/><br/>Reimplemented by: <br/><br/>    Industry<br/><br/><br/>",

The game utilizes a two-phase system for deck building and combat. During the Machinations Phase, players recruit gladiators, secure the support of influential patrons, increase their income, and train their gladiators in a multitude of tactics. When the crowd&rsquo;s bloodlust becomes insatiable, the game shifts to the Arena Phase, during which players control their gladiators in various arenas to battle their opponents&rsquo; gladiators for glory. Each gladiator has a unique set of stats and a unique ability. Having the right synergies between gladiators often means the difference between death and glory. During arena battles, players also play tactic and reaction cards from their hand to support their gladiators, or turn the tides of battle. The first player to gain six glory by winning arena battles is the victor, and will be remembered for all time as the greatest lanista of Rome.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Man O' War is the game of Raging Sea Battles in the Warhammer World. As an admiral of an ocean-going war fleet you must command your ships - which can be either  squadrons of Ships of the Line or heavily armored Men O' War, in the battle for supremacy of the high seas.<br/><br/>Players choose fleets from the multitude of races of the Warhammer world. Every ship is represented by a template showing individual areas, each with a description of the items (masts, cannons etc.) in those areas - as well as the damage that they can take before being destroyed. Each location has a value that must be rolled to hit that area when attacked, along with another value that can be rolled by the defending player to possibly prevent any damage that might occur. Ships are classified as Ship of the Line (SOL) - which are designed to move as a group of three (each moving and fighting to completion before continuing on with the next ship in the squadron), a Man O' War (MOW)- which are single ships that are much larger, more powerful and crewed by larger numbers than a single SOL classed ship, or finally as an Independent (IND) - which are used individually like a Man O' War but are more in line in strength and abilities to that of a Ship of the Line.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each turn, players determine Initiative by each rolling a die which determines either who will go 1st in each phase - if the numbers are different, or how the wind direction changes if they both roll the same number. If the wind changes, the initiative roll and resolution is repeated until one player wins the die roll.<br/><br/>Players then conduct the Magic Phase with each Admiral having his Wizard make one spell attempt if desired. If a spell is successful, the other player can try and dispel that cast spell if they have a corresponding type of magic to make the attempt.<br/><br/>Next comes the Battle phase which is based on the previously determined initiative roll and players alternate between phases of Movement/Combat, each choosing a single MOW, IND or SOL Squadron and then conducting movement and making attacks before passing the turn sequence back to their opponent. This process continues until all ships have moved on both sides. Once that has occurred, the turn is over and a series of quick turn ending/record keeping events occurs before moving to the next turn. Game play continues for a predetermined time or until one side is destroyed, surrenders or flees the battlefield.<br/><br/>There were two separate expansions to the main game. The first was Plaguefleet which added rules and templates for the Chaos fleets of Khorne, Slaanesh, Tzeentch and Nurgle (collectively known as a Plaguefleet), the Skaven and finally the Chaos Dwarfs. This expansion effectively doubled the number of available fleets for the game. This expansion also included color templates for the original 6 races as well (Imperial, Bretonnian, Dwarf, High Elf, Dark Elf and Orc).<br/><br/>The 2nd expansion Sea of Blood mainly introduced new rules for Airpower, Sea Monsters &amp; Beasts and Allies as well as new ships for the Dwarfs and Imperial fleets. The inclusion of the Norse fleet wrapped up the content for this expansion.<br/><br/>Finally, complete rules for an Undead fleet - as well as some expansion rules for a few of the other races, were included in several of the issues of Game Workshop's Citadel Journal magazine.<br/><br/>A wide variety of miniatures were produced to represent the many ships detailed in the main game and expansion sets but no miniatures were ever officially made for the Undead fleet. Assembling and painting the miniatures gave the game a feeling of being &quot;collectible&quot; as well as being a hobby in itself. Many players have created customized ships and new ships (and even complete fleets) including rules, ships templates and completed miniatures. The largest collection of these creations is housed at the Yahoo group Sea of Claws.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bag of Chips is a party game in which you will face crucial choices to score as many points as possible at the end of each round. Be careful, though, because if you're too greedy, you will lose a lot!<br/><br/>At the start of a round, each player is dealt six objective cards and the 25 chips &mdash; in five colors, ranging from 7 yellow potato chips to 3 orange chicken chips &mdash; are placed in the bag. Someone draws five chips from the bag and places them on the table, then everyone discards two of their objective cards. The player draws four more chips, then everyone discards another objective card. The player draws three more chips, after which everyone places two of their cards on the positive scoring side of their playing area and the final card on the negative scoring side. The player then draws two more chips, one by one, both for increased drama and for some of the objective cards.<br/><br/>If a played objective card has not been completed, discard it. Add the points from your completed positive objective cards (if any), then subtract points from your negative objective card (if any). The player with the highest score wins two reward tokens, and the player with the second highest score wins one reward tokens. Complete rounds until someone has four or more reward tokens and wins. (In a two-player game, only the player with the higher score receives a reward token, and whoever first collects three tokens wins.)<br/><br/>",

Chart your course from start to finish using destination and transportation tiles. With a little luck and clever planning, you just might outmaneuver your fellow travelers. The first traveler to make connections for a ten day journey wins the game.<br/><br/>In this fourth installment of the 10 Days in series, the players are touring Asia, arranging their tiles on the ten days (open spots) of their trays to create a string of consecutive steps that, once completed, creates one consecutive journey. Tiles of neighboring countries may be placed side-by-side on the tray, with trains, ships and airplanes connecting distant countries depending on where they are located. Tiles cannot be rearranged in a tray, but must be replaced one at a time from the few face-up tiles available to all players, or from a random draw.<br/><br/>This installment introduces railroads which allow players to connect any countries that have stops along a selected rail line. These work in addition to the now-familiar airlines (connecting countries of the same color), and ocean liners (although now you have two oceans to contend with).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 375 A.D., Attila's mounted Huns overran Europe causing the Germanic tribes in their path to flee and penetrate the outer provinces of the declining Roman empire. In Attila, the players influence the migrations of the Germanic tribes to the Roman empire. The winner is the player who has exerted the best influence on the most successful of the tribes.<br/><br/>Players have a hand of cards which correspond to the invading tribes. A turn consists firstly of playing a card and placing the matching tribal marker onto an area of the board, expanding from their start areas, then secondly either repeating this or increasing their influence in that tribe. If a province now contains 5 tribal markers in total, war breaks out between the tribes. The basic strength of each tribe is the number of markers there, but each player can add matching cards from their hand to boost this. The weakest tribe is eliminated (or rather, all tribes with the lowest total), leaving the province at peace and with no possibility of further tribal markers being added. Scoring occurs four times during the game at the end of each century; the first century ends after one war, the second after a further two and so on. The player with the most influence in each tribe scores 1 point for each tribe marker, the player in second place scores one point per area the tribe is in (thus if there is only one tribal marker of one sort in each area both 1st and 2nd will score the same). The influence a player gains increases in each century, so large swings in control are possible.<br/><br/>Players are thus aiming to expand tribes in which they have the most influence (and conversely, are gaining influence in the tribes they expand) whilst at the same time trying to manipulate the timing and provinces where wars happen with a view to protecting their own favoured tribes and eliminating others. Gameplay is therefore not just about playing out as many of 'your' tribes as you can as you will need matching cards to defend with, and in any case may simply not have the right cards in hand. And sometimes you will want to provoke a conflict, for example by adding a tribe you don't have much influence in to finish an area where one of your favoured tribes is strong.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The ancient manuscripts talk about a Leviathan, a huge creature lying on the silt bed of the lagoon on whose back the city has its foundations. All manuscripts agree on its eternal sleep and they all tell that the beast will wake up one day, shaking the city from its muddy roots, smashing the vitrified stilts on which the city stands, and crashing it into the seething sea where the monster will rise. The ancients say, however, that there will be signs; it is written that the Venetians will feel the tremors, that they would therefore save themselves from the monster, who will recover his freedom by plunging into the waves a deserted city.<br/><br/>But there were no signs. What ancients did not know is that the Leviathan is not alive. For centuries, the city lived and prospered on the back of a corpse. That corpse, though, is now awakening &ndash; and with it the dead arise from the lagoon...<br/><br/>In the cooperative game Carnival Zombie, players lead a group of characters who are fleeing on terra firma from the terror that has emerged from the lagoon of Venice. This group of characters must make its way through hordes of rotting &quot;Infected&quot; to leave the city, and players need to rush as the Leviathan upon which the foundations of Venice were built is awakening. Thus, it's only a matter of time before the city sinks in the dark waters of the lagoon.<br/><br/>Each game is divided into several nights and days. During the nights, players hide in trenches behind the barricades to resist the attacks of the Infected. During the day, players move through the city, which is shaken by tremors. The Infected are drawn by the groans of the Leviathan in the abyss to help their master free itself from the rotting stilts that nail it to the silt bed.<br/><br/>Players have several ways to get out of town, but little time to do it &ndash; and their path is hindered by the bosses, the most implacable servants of the Leviathan. If the players do make it out, they can assess their skills &ndash; and set a goal for next time &ndash; by counting the points scored during the game.<br/><br/>",

It's part of a line of combined dice-and-card games that publisher AMIGO Spiel introduced in 2012.<br/><br/>As you might expect with a game titled Piraten Kapern, players must set off in search of treasure, pushing themselves to find as much as possible without losing their heads.<br/><br/>At the start of a turn, the active player rolls the eight special dice. He must set aside any skulls rolled, and his turn ends immediately with no score if he rolls a third skull. The player is free to set aside any number of other dice, rerolling the rest. He may continue to do this until the skulls get him or he stops. He then scores for dice combinations, with a three-of-a-kind earning 100 points, a four-of-a-kind 200 points, and so on all the way up to an eight-of-a-kind earning 4,000 points. Each gold or diamond showing is worth 100 points on its own. A player earns a 500 point bonus if all eight dice score.<br/>If a player is not able to set aside any valid dice, all points are lost.<br/><br/>If a player rolls four or more skulls on his first roll, he heads to Skull Island for the turn, setting aside those skulls and continuing to roll as long as he sets aside at least one skull each time. Once he stops, all other players lose 100 points for each skull showing.<br/><br/>Before a player starts to roll for his turn, however, he draws a card from the pirate deck, which affects what's possible on that turn: He might score double for the treasure he collects, or need to roll sabers to fight off other pirates, or receive a free diamond or gold coin, or be able to score treasure even if he collect three skulls.<br/><br/>Once a player reaches 6,000 points, all other players take one final turn, then the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Before starting the game, each player can exchange their Emperor pawn with another of their pawns elsewhere on the board. On your turn, you must do both phases in this order: the action phase, then the reinforcements phase. During the action phase, you must perform one single action:<br/><br/><br/>    Move: Move to an empty space, regroup or attack; you can attack only a stack of enemy pieces that contains strictly fewer pieces than the attacking stack &mdash; except that a stack of four pieces can be attacked and destroyed by a stack of one piece.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Construct: You can construct only one building per space; subsequent construction on the same space replaces the existing building. Each terrain type allows specific types of construction. In order to construct a building on an empty space or on a space already containing one of your buildings, you must sacrifice pieces from a single stack adjacent to this construction space. <br/><br/><br/>Once per turn, you can take an extra action by sacrificing three stackable pieces. A stack that contains the Emperor can attack an enemy stack even if it contains an equal number of pieces, and even if it contains another Emperor. Each enemy Emperor you have captive is worth 3 VP.<br/><br/>During the reinforcements phase, if you have pieces in your reserve, you must return at least one piece to play if you can.<br/>You can place up to three pieces onto a single stack of your color on the board (never on an empty space), respecting the following rule: You cannot place reinforcements on a stack if it is adjacent to another player's building.<br/><br/>The game ends immediately when a player has amassed 12 VP by adding up the values of his buildings on the board and any Emperors they have captured &mdash; each village is worth 1VP, each tower 2VP, and each castle and captured Emperor 3VP &mdash; and they have at least one palace.

In honor of next year&rsquo;s 60th anniversary of D-Day, Avalon Hill will release Axis &amp; Allies D-Day, a new, stand-alone extension of the classic strategy game Axis &amp; Allies. Axis &amp; Allies D-Day will allow players to recreate the largest amphibious invasion in history.<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies D-Day features detailed game components including a new blockhouse piece, an extra-large game board, and original artwork commissioned exclusively for the D-Day game box. Other elements of this new Axis &amp; Allies variant include a card deck with three card types -- Orders, Tactics, and Fortune -- to add depth and complexity to play. Order cards determine play sequence and break turns into distinct phases; Tactics cards offer players varied strategic opportunities; and Fortune cards add an element of unpredictability.<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies D-Day begins as Operation Overlord, the invasion of German-held Normandy, is underway -- 130,000 soldiers of the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States are poised to assault Fortress Europe. You and your fellow world powers control their fates.<br/><br/>One player controls Germany, whose Axis forces have turned the beaches of Normandy into a near-impenetrable stronghold. Set to breach those defenses are the Allies: the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States. The future of Europe and the world hangs in the balance.<br/><br/>Axis &amp; Allies D-Day is designed for two or three players and can be played in two hours. Axis &amp; Allies D-Day is the third Axis &amp; Allies variant, following the successful Axis &amp; Allies Europe and Axis &amp; Allies Pacific, both of which were published in 2001.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cities: Skylines &ndash; The Board Game is a co-operative game based on the popular computer game of the same name by Paradox Interactive.<br/><br/>Gameplay starts with four land boards being visible, the exact number varying depending on the scenario. The goal is to finish a number of milestones and to make the inhabitants of your city happy. At the start of each milestone, one additional board is bought, flipped over from its nature side to its developed side. Players have personal cards that show what they can build, and ideally they discuss and plan with the other players how to best develop the city. The cards show what effects the building will have on the city, for example increasing the need for garbage collection, decreasing crime, or giving a bonus if placed next to a park.<br/><br/>Cardboard tiles represent residential, commercial, industrial, and other buildings, and they have varied base shapes that are placed on the developed boards on the grid.<br/><br/>When the players have developed the city to the next milestone, they choose which new board to buy to expand the city, score their current happiness, and start a new milestone. When the last milestone is finished, the game ends, then the total happiness score is summed. There is only one city treasury, and all players add to it when they make money for the city and take money from it for building a hospital or buying a new board.

It includes a replayable campaign format, with variable unlocking content, for playing a series of 5 games connected together to tell a larger story. Throughout the campaign, you'll unlock new modules with additional rules and story elements. With 40 new modules and 174 cards in the campaign deck, you can reset everything and play multiple campaigns &mdash; with a different story and gameplay experience emerging each time.<br/><br/>In the standard game, each player has double-sided clue cards in front of them. On your turn, you use actions to flip, draw, and trade clue cards, gain ideas, and confirm clue cards as evidence. Confirm 5 clues of the same type to solve part of the case. As you discover more and more of the solution, a story starts to emerge: your Neighbor stole something from the ice cream shop, but what? And why? To crack the case, you must find the solution to all 5 parts before the suspect escapes or you run out of clues.<br/><br/>You can always play a single, standalone game of Spy Club, but the campaign mode is the recommended way to play:<br/><br/><br/>     Each game plays in 45 minutes, and each campaign consists of 5 games.<br/>     Some elements from each game carry forward and affect future games, with new rules and story elements are unlocked each play.<br/>     The sequence of content isn&rsquo;t scripted, so each campaign will unfold differently.<br/>     Everything can be fully reset and replayed.<br/>     You only unlock a small portion of the total content in one campaign (just 4 of the 40 modules), so you can play multiple campaigns and continue unlocking new content each time!<br/><br/><br/>",

The game includes 125 tokens, with each token showing one of five colors, one of five symbols, and one of five numbers (1-5). The scoring boards show conditions that you must meet in order to earn the points listed on that board, e.g., the numbers 1-5 in sequence, tokens of the same color, tokens with different symbols, three tokens of one color and two tokens of another color, etc.<br/><br/>To start the game, draw two tokens from the bag and place them at the bottom of your playing board. Place one of these tokens in an empty space of your grid, then choose a scoring board and place it in the row, column, or (if appropriate) diagonal line in which that token was placed. On each subsequent turn, draw one token, place it on your game board, then choose one of your two tokens to place. If this newly placed token doesn't have a scoring board pointing at it, choose one of your unplaced scoring boards and place it in the row, column, or diagonal.<br/><br/>As soon as a line is filled with five tokens, if you have met the conditions on the scoring board for this line, flip it over to the side that shows points; if you are the first and only player to complete this scoring board this round, take the associated 3-point bonus tile. If you complete and score multiple lines on the same turn, take 5-20 bonus points depending on whether you scored two, three, or even four lines at once.<br/><br/>If someone drew a lucky charm token at the start of the round, they draw a replacement token, then all players can choose to use and discard one of their lucky charm tiles. These tiles allow you to exchange the tokens in your reserve, place a token on the board as a joker, swap an already fulfilled scoring board for another one, and so on. Each unused lucky charm tile is worth points at game's end. After 25 rounds, players tally their points for scoring boards, first tiles, lucky charm tiles, and bonuses to see who has the highest score.<br/><br/>",

Your task is to group animals of the same species together in families as large as possible. But large families are only half the battle: to score a lot of points, they also need access to watering holes and must avoid bad weather.<br/><br/>A turn comprises two simple steps: First, one player chooses a feature (species or watering hole) and a terrain requirement from a limited selection. Then, each player must place one of their tokens showing that feature onto one of their park spaces obeying that terrain requirement. What seems no trouble at first grows more and more challenging and exciting as the available spaces become fewer and fewer. But it&rsquo;s not only the choices of your fellow players that can disrupt your plans. There are also unpredictable weather tokens that you must take into account.<br/><br/>After five rounds, the game ends. Then you score your most valuable family of each species and the terrains you completely populated.<br/><br/>Caldera Park is an interactive puzzle-game that achieves a perfect balance between strategic planning and luck.

        "description": "Guild Ball is a tactical miniatures game of skirmish soccer. Two coaches lead six players from their respective guilds in a race to 12 points--gaining 4 points for scoring a goal, 2 points for taking out a regular player, and 1 point for taking out a mascot (yes, one of the six players on each team is a mascot). During each turn, coaches alternate activating one player at a time. With a small number of models per side, Guild Ball delivers great depth of strategy, balancing ball control, attack, and defense.<br/><br/>The strategy in Guild Ball continues with the playbook system. Attacks are resolved by rolling dice against the target's defenses, but dice alone do not dictate the results of attacks. Coaches choose the results of attacks from their players' playbooks: the more successful hits an attack roll generates, the more options from the playbook the coach is able to choose from. Possible results include damage, tackles, knock-downs, pushes, dodges, and powerful character plays that can change the course of the game.<br/><br/>Guild Ball is also a game of resource management: coaches must manage influence and momentum. Teams start each turn with a pool of influence. In order for a player to attack, kick the ball, or perform a character play, the player needs influence. Coaches allocate influence to players at the start of the turn, so careful planning is required. Momentum is generated by special playbook results and successful passes. Momentum allows a coach to perform special actions, such as taking shots on goal, healing damage, or making out-of-activation dodges. Momentum remaining at the end of a turn also affects the initiative roll for the next turn.<br/><br/>Featuring 11 unique guilds, each with at least 12 players--and more guilds to be released--Guild Ball allows coaches to choose their own play style.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is the new entry for the Filosofia printing of Power Grid.  As the new game changes the map of the original, the two games should be regarded as separate entities.<br/><br/>M&eacute;gawatts is the French release of the Friedemann Friese game Power Grid. The French edition is produced by Filosofia.<br/><br/>As with Power Grid, the object of M&eacute;gawatts is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.<br/><br/>However, as plants are purchased, newer more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.<br/><br/>Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.<br/><br/>It differs from Power Grid by the maps included. Where Power Grid has the USA/Germany maps, the French version by Filosofia has the Qu&eacute;bec/France maps.<br/><br/>The Qu&eacute;bec map uses minor rules change that makes a bigger use of the renewable power plants to represent the regional reality of hydro-electricity.<br/><br/>The ruleset includes the basic game, as in Power Grid plus the minor rule changes for the two maps included.<br/><br/> Re-Implements: <br/><br/><br/>     Power Grid<br/>     Funkenschlag<br/><br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/><br/>     Power Grid: France/Italy<br/>     Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe<br/>     Atolla Modulis (fan expansion for Funkenschlag)<br/>     Power Grid: The New Power Plants – Set 1<br/>     Power Grid: China/Korea<br/>     Power Grid: Flux Generator<br/><br/><br/>The expansions Power Grid: France/Italy, Power Grid: Benelux/Central Europe and Power Grid: China/Korea include new double-sided game boards. These change the game by not only changing the characteristics of the geography, but also by changing the rules for power plant availability, resource availability, tying plant ownership and/or resource availability and/or price to geographic regions on the map, etc.<br/><br/>Incorporated into:<br/><br/>     Power Grid: Québec/Baden-Württemberg (the Quebec map)<br/><br/><br/>",

The clientele of customers is represented by a deck of cards with various Chinese dishes on them. Customers are served one at a time while a 20-second sand timer is running. If they are not served in time, they eat free.<br/><br/>Each order requires a combination of ingredients to make. The board is used for tracking the levels of ten prepared ingredients in the kitchen. To prepare more ingredients, players spend dice in different combinations. All players are in charge of different tasks and all working simultaneously because the timer is running!<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players pool their money and invest in different options to grow their business: new recipes, upgrade preparation cards, or advertise to get more customers. The players must have a certain level of profit by the last round to keep the restaurant open and win!<br/><br/>",

There's a ring of light in the middle, covered by a cardboard disc and a blazing fire. Cauldrons circle that disc. The goal is to get one's own cauldron to the ring of light by pushing the bits on the board.<br/><br/>You start pushing from the side of the board and push in one continuous movement until you hear a clack; something has fallen off the board. Your turn ends there. Next player is up, and this continues until someone's cauldron is in the ring of light.<br/><br/>The gimmick: the game is played in pitch black. When played in the dark, the fire, cauldrons, wizards (used to push the pieces) and the ring of light all glow, while the trees and discs turn invisible. The game can also be played in the light of the day, but it loses a lot of its charm.<br/><br/>Ages 6 and up.<br/><br/>",

In Westeros, the death of Robert Baratheon has created a power vacuum with rival Houses competing for control of The Iron Throne. Meanwhile, in Essos, Daenerys Targaryen is building an army to contest the rule of the Ghiscari slavers, before returning to reclaim The Iron Throne. There are 3 different ways to play RISK Game of Thrones:<br/><br/>1. SKIRMISH<br/>Basic version designed as an introduction to RISK Game of Thrones game play. Once you are comfortable, move on to Dominion.<br/><br/>2. DOMINION<br/>Advanced version of RISK Game of Thrones including Objectives, Characters, and Maester cards, offering more in-depth strategic action.<br/><br/>3. WORLD AT WAR<br/>Play with both maps and up to seven players using either the Skirmish or Dominion rules.<br/><br/>RISK Game of Thrones includes two game board maps and seven House armies. Westeros map is for 3-5 player game and Essos map is for 2 player game. There is a deck of territory cards for each map, and these function in a similar way to the original RISK gameplay. When playing Dominion rules, the character cards can grant special abilities to your House, the maester cards can grant tactical advantages during deployment and battles, and objective cards create goals and strategies for earning Victory Points.<br/><br/>Skirmish rules are most similar to the original RISK rules. There are minor thematic variations to suit the new map. The winner is determined by which player controls the most territories, castles and ports when the end game card is revealed.<br/><br/>Dominion rules add the additional mechanics and cards described above. Instead of simply trying to control the most territories, castles, and ports you are now trying to achieve specific Objectives to earn Victory Points, furthering your efforts to consolidate power and establish dominion over the rival Houses. Objectives are worth from 1 to 4 Victory Points, based on the difficulty to achieve them. The first player to earn 10 Victory Points while also controlling their Seat of Power wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Glory and esteem are waiting!<br/><br/>Thebes: The Tomb Raiders is a card game version of the Thebes board game from designer Peter Prinz and Queen Games.  The game dispenses with the map of Thebes, but retains many of the main aspects of the game.  The main turn-order play of the game is based on the time-track; players must spend time to take actions, with varying amounts of time spent dependent on the nature and benefits of the action.  The player who is furthest back &quot;in time&quot; is the active player.  Players use actions to gain knowledge about five civilizations, and then use this knowledge in different actions to &quot;dig&quot; to pull cards from a civilization's deck that contains treasures and dirt.  The more knowledge a player has about a civilization, the more efficient the player is at searching for treasures.<br/><br/>The game plays over a certain span of time, and when all players can no longer take any actions because they are out of time, the game is at an end, and the player with the highest score from their accumulated treasures wins.<br/><br/>",

In addition, you place three technology tiles at random on the tan, orange and violet sections of the tech chart and six random tiles on the brown section; the tech tiles show 1-5 arrows. You also shuffle tan, orange and violet decks of cards and place them in the appropriate places. Tan cards provide an one-shot effect, orange cards give you a permanent power, and violet cards present you with an objective you must meet; if you do so, you can play the objective card on your turn, and immediately draw another. You can play at most one card of each color each turn.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:<br/><br/><br/>    Place a new piece on a region of the game board, with this piece sharing two of the three characteristics of a piece in a neighboring region; the new piece cannot be shorter than the original piece. Mark this piece with a token of your player color.<br/>    Move one of your pieces on the board to an empty region, with short pieces moving only one space, medium height pieces moving up to two spaces, and tall pieces up to three.<br/>    Take over a region controlled by an opponent by moving one of your pieces into this region and relocating the opponent's piece to the region your piece left. You can do this only if the attacking piece is thicker than the opponent's piece.<br/><br/><br/>When you place a new piece on the board or move an existing piece, you're rewarded based on the color of the space you occupy. If you place in or move into a tan, orange or violet region, either you take a tile and the top card of this color or you draw three cards of this color and keep one of them. For a brown region, you either draw two tiles from the brown section of the tech board or draw one tile from anywhere. The technology tiles must be acquired from low to high &ndash; so you can't acquire a 4 unless you have a 3 &ndash; but you can have multiple tech stacks. You must meet a certain technology threshold in order to play the orange cards and acquire their special power.<br/><br/>In addition, you can score points during the game by occupying a grassland on a continent or the two regions on opposite sides of a waterway strait.<br/><br/>Players take turns until either all of the pieces are on the game board or all the tiles have been acquired or all the cards of one color have been drawn. Once this happens, players tally their points for objectives, grasslands, straits, tech tiles, and cards still in hand to see who wins!<br/><br/>",

This simple act of negligence created a towering and lethal inferno which would eventually destroy 13,000 houses and leave nearly 90 percent of the city's population destitute and homeless...<br/><br/>You are no simple bystander to this tragedy; the future of London lies in your hands.<br/><br/>In The Great Fire of London 1666, the players are men of wealth and standing who own property around London. The Lord Mayor has failed to act and it is down to these mighty men to lead trained bands of militia to fight the fire and save the city. To do so they must decide which districts to sacrifice to the fire and which to protect. Remember, these same men own much of London, thus such choices will shape their own future and greatly affect their wealth and standing.<br/><br/>Use the trained bands to suppress the fire and explosives to destroy blocks of housing to create fire breaks and prevent its spread. Do you choose to protect your own homes, turning a blind eye and allowing the fire to consume your rival's property? Or will you stand as the hero of London, and choose to save as much of the city as possible?<br/><br/>Victory can belong to the player with the most property left after the ashes settle, but stopping the fire and saving London's most famous landmarks may win a more altruistic land owner the hearts and minds of the people.<br/><br/>Save the city, or watch it burn.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Illiterati are an evil secret organization that has taken over the world. Your job as a member of the League of Librarians is to save the world's books &mdash; one word at a time.<br/><br/>Illiterati is a real-time, co-operative word game in which players work together to form words and bind books. Each player starts the game with five letter tiles and a red torched book that shows a condition that player must achieve to restore that book, e.g. using 8+ tiles with at least 3 green symbols, create words that are all animals. A library of three random tiles is placed in the center of the table. The game takes place in three-minute rounds, and before the round begins each player draw seven letter tiles from the draw bag.<br/><br/>Once the countdown begins, players can talk and trade letters as much as they want with one another and the library to try to achieve their goal. Once time ends, if the library contains too many letters &mdash; and this threshold is based on your difficulty level &mdash; then you trigger a burn event. Flip all of these letters face down, then remove one of them from the game, then discard excess letters to the discard bag. If you burn too many letters, you lose the game. If you didn't burn any letters and you've completed your goal, flip your red book face down and draw a blue waterlogged book to give yourself a new goal.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, draw an illiterati villain card and resolve its effect. If you've drawn this villain previously &mdash; and the deck contains five copies of five villains &mdash; then all of the previous effects from this villain also resolve in a chain attack from newest to oldest. Villain attacks often strip letters from words, which means you'll need to create new words with what's left during the next round to avoid burning another letter.<br/><br/>Once all players have completed two books &mdash; or three or four depending on your difficulty level &mdash; draw one more book, the Final Chapter, with all players needing to complete this challenge in the same round, e.g., using 12+ tiles, create words in which all of your vowels are the same color. If all players meet this goal during the same round, you win; if even one person fails, another villain attacks, then you draw new tiles to start another round. You can discard and redraw up to seven tiles at the start of a round, but you must draw a second illiterati villain card that round &mdash; and if the villain deck runs out, you lose.<br/><br/>",

Each player has her own scoresheet, which represents her zoo, with space for five types of animals: one crocodile, two ostriches, up to five lions. The scoresheet also has space to collect coins and barns for animals that don't fit in the appropriate pens.<br/><br/>On a turn, the active player takes one of two actions:<br/><br/>    Take two dice from the reserve, roll them, then assign each die to a transport cart on the game board.<br/>    Take all the dice in one transport cart, then tick off the animals/coins on those dice on your scoresheet.<br/><br/><br/>Dice can be placed in separate carts, and the number of dice is limited to six, eight, or ten depending on the number of players. The round continues until each player has taken dice from a cart, then a new round begins. The first player to fill the pen of a particular type of animal receives a bonus; if a player takes more animals than she has room for, however, she ticks off the barn for each type of overflow animal.<br/><br/>The game ends once a player has filled all her animal pens or has space in only one pen. Players score one point for each animal and any bonus points they received; they lose two points for each barn ticked off, but for each group of coins collected, one penalty can be ignored. (Alternatively, coin groups are worth one point.) The player with the highest score wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lignum is a game about the logging industry in the 19th century. As a woodcutter, your task is to prevail against your competitors and collect the most money after two years. Lignum (Latin for &quot;wood&quot;) is a game for lovers of complex strategy games. After cutting and transporting your wood, don't think your job is finished. You'll still have to optimize your entire processing chain - and have fun doing it!<br/><br/>Each of the eight rounds always begins with the cutting of trees. If your supply lines are set up and the timber has been approved for felling, then the players claim an area using secretly selected cards. Since each of the areas contain differing amounts of food and wood, players must learn to recognize and adapt to their opponent's strategies because if two players are both in the same area, they must share the resources. Players continue to move along their supply route, using the marketplace to trade tools and food as well as recruit workers.<br/><br/>The players have to decide how their wood will be transported to their lumberyards (by raft, by foot, or in the winter by sled), if the wood should be dried or be processed immediately, and when the wood should be sold. The player must also think about new acquisitions (such as saws, sleds and pasture land) and fulfill orders to sell the wood. Because in the end, this business is all about money, and whoever can make the most wins.<br/><br/>",

This spectacular building is world-renowned as a sacred place for the Sikh community and one of the most famous pilgrimage destinations on Earth.<br/>After being demolished several times, Maharaja Ranjit Singh rebuilt it using marble, copper and 750 kilos of pure gold, hence its name.<br/>In Amritsar, the players will represent the different personalities of the time who helped the Maharaja of the Sikh Empire with the reconstruction of the Golden Temple.<br/>Using a clever mechanic based on the sowing system of the classic mancala games, players will use the different workers and their very own elephant to carry out the necessary tasks. On your turn, you will be able to perform 1-3 actions depending on how well you have coordinated the workers and your elephant. These actions will consist of collecting resources in the quarry or the market, advancing on the different paths of knowledge, improving your personal board, turning to your mahout (elephant rider) for help and above all making donations to the temple with the aim of obtaining as many prestige points as possible. At the end of the game, the player with the most prestige will be declared the winner of the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from GMT website:)<br/><br/>The Dark Valley is a new game from award-winning designer Ted Raicer, focusing on the entire East Front campaign in World War II. The game components feature a beautiful map from Mark Mahaffey, stretching from Leningrad in the north to the Caucasus Mountains in the south, and around 600 counters representing every major unit that appeared during the course of the conflict. Initially most Soviet infantry are divisions, but as the game progresses these are replaced by armies and corps, so that players are not overwhelmed by the increasing Soviet Order of Battle.  All German mechanized divisions are present in the game, while their infantry is a mix of division and corps.<br/><br/>Although the game is a semi-monster, and covers the entirety of the conflict from the launch of Barbarossa to the end of the war, the game system emphasizes playability rather than rules overhead, allowing the players to concentrate on strategy choices rather than rules minutiae.<br/><br/>The core of the game system is a &ldquo;chit-pull&rdquo; activation system. Each turn a variety of action chits are drawn, in a random order, from the Action Chit Pool, and it is this that determines the exact flow of operations on that turn. [...]<br/><br/>This chit-pull system imposes constant uncertainty upon the player and introduces considerable tension into the game. [...]<br/><br/>The Axis supply network, which imposed crucial restraints upon the effectiveness of the offensive, is represented using supply depot units.[...]<br/><br/>Besides the full campaign game, TDV features scenarios for Barbarossa, Case Blue, Kursk, and the Destruction of Army Group Center. Scenario start dates can also be used to explore shorter versions of the campaign.<br/><br/>The Dark Valley is designed to be playable and exciting, modeling the tension of the campaign elegantly and simply. The game also plays very well in solitaire mode due to the underlying chit-pull system. From the German blitzkrieg in 1941 to the blazing ruins of Berlin, The Dark Valley provides a truly new look at this much-gamed theater.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: 1 or 2 months per turn<br/>MAP SCALE: 20 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE: Divisions/Corps/Armies<br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/><br/>    Two 22x34&quot; maps<br/>    Three sheets of 1/2 &quot; counters<br/>    Four Player Aid Cards<br/>    Two 6-sided dice<br/>    Rules Booklet<br/>    Players Booklet <br/><br/><br/>DESIGNER: Ted S.

A promise has been broken, an evil omen is in the sky, a crown is at stake, and history is about to be made...<br/><br/>1066, Tears to Many Mothers is an asymmetric, competitive, tactical card game in the style of Magic the Gathering, but non-collectable. Each player, as either Normans or Saxons, musters troops and resources to overcome the various obstacles in their way before the two armies clash on the battlefield at Hastings.<br/><br/>Every card in the game is inspired by a real person or event from the time. With a focus on quick, tactical play and a thematic re-imagining of the events of the time, there is no deck building required, each player simply grabs their deck and shuffles, then play begins.<br/><br/>Honours: 1066, Tears to Many Mothers was a runner up in the Golden Geek Awards, and was nominated in the Origins Awards for 'Best Historical Board Game'.<br/><br/>Note on title: In April of 1066 Halley's Comet was in its perihelion orbit and writers at the time said it was four times the size of Venus and shining with a light equal to a quarter of that of the Moon. Many thought it was an evil omen, or even the end of the world - the monk Eilmer of Malmesbury Abbey wrote about the event: &quot;You've come, have you? &ndash; You've come, you source of tears to many mothers. It is long since I saw you; but as I see you now you are much more terrible, for I see you brandishing the downfall of my country.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Choose one of your favorite characters from Resident Evil such as: Chris Redfield, Jill Valentine, or Albert Wesker among others. Players start with only the most basic of items and weapons. As the game progresses, players build their arsenal with additional Weapons, Ammunition, Action or Item cards to customize their deck and improve their ability in defeating the Infected!  Your deck will be your lifeline to survival.  How will you survive the zombie outbreak?<br/><br/>The Resident Evil DBG will consist of 250 playing cards, 3 different game modes (Story, Mercenary and Versus) and hundreds of possible scenarios within each mode for unlimited replay value.  No two games will ever be the same!<br/><br/><br/>     Story mode is the main version of the game where players must race to claim the best weapons, items, and ammunition before others get to it first. Quick thinking and a good instinct will help you survive the Mansion and be the one to escape to safety.  <br/>     Mercenary mode is similar to Story mode but this mode rewards the players that take the offensive. Players must prove their skills by defeating as many zombies as they can in a limited amount of time. This mode can be played in teams.<br/>     Versus mode removes the Infected from the game and pits the human characters against each other in a battle for dominance. Players must watch their back as they attempt to defeat each other while staying alive themselves. Watch out because you may find that players are not as merciful as the Infected!<br/><br/><br/>Players take on the role of one of the Heroes of Resident Evil. They start with a deck of 10 cards, which consist of Weapons and Ammo. Players must use their resources to obtain more powerful Weapons, Ammo, Items, and Action Cards that they add to their deck. As you progress in the game your Deck will become stronger and more efficient. You must use the cards in your deck to fight the &quot;Infected&quot; creatures which awards you Decorations . To win the game you must defeat more &quot;Infected&quot; creatures then your opponents, but the game only ends when the strongest &quot;Infected&quot; creatures is killed. Once he is killed, the player that has gained the most Decorations wins the game.<br/><br/><br/>     Ammo cards are used to power your Weapons as well as purchase new cards.<br/>     Weapon cards are used to battle the &quot;Infected&quot; creatures.

The first to place an airplane on a link gains cheaper rights, but other players can still use the link for a price. A number of flight cards are on display; a player can claim one after connecting the two cities shown.  Longer flights are worth more points, but the short flights are easier and less expensive to achieve, and they bring in just as much income as the long flights. At the end, it's urgent to get your secret Final Flight done, connecting three cities.

        "description": "From the award-winning, best-selling creators of Exploding Kittens and Throw Throw Burrito, A Little Wordy is a fresh and ridiculously clever take on the genre of tile-based word-unscrambling games.<br/><br/>Here&rsquo;s how it works: You&rsquo;re each given a pile of letters. Rearrange your letters until you come up with a word. Be sneaky and choose a word that your opponent won&rsquo;t easily guess.<br/><br/>Write it down, keep it a secret. Rescramble your tiles, pass them to your opponent. The goal is to examine your opponent&rsquo;s tiles and try to figure out their word. You do this with Clue Cards. These tell you things such as: what&rsquo;s the first letter, how long&rsquo;s the word, or what does it rhyme with? You win by using as FEW of these clue cards as possible to figure out what word your opponent wrote down.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s thoughtful, strategic, highly-replayable, and built specifically for two players. It&rsquo;s not a game about having the mightiest vocabulary - it&rsquo;s a game about making clever choices.<br/><br/>The longest, most complicated word isn&rsquo;t always the best choice. Sometimes, picking a smaller, common word is better because your brainiac opponent will overthink things and blaze right past it. Trying to figure out your opponent&rsquo;s secret word can be both hilarious and (delightfully) maddening. A Little Wordy levels the playing field against veteran word wizards.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "キャットインザボックス (Cat in the Box) is a trick-taking card game from Japan, based upon ideas from quantum mechanics. Players play cards from their hands of different values. But the colour of the card is not determined until the card is played, and the cat is let out of the box.<br/><br/>Played over three rounds for three players, and four rounds for four, players begin by making a bid on the number of tricks they will win, based only upon the value of their hand cards. The cats on the cards have no colour at this point. Players will score for tricks they win, and score more for completing their bid.<br/><br/>As a player leads with a card from their hand, they declare its colour. A player's marker goes onto the communal research board, covering the value for that colour. Subsequent cards must have different values of the same colour if possible. However, a player may declare that they do not have any more cards of that colour, and so play the same value but in a different colour. That player now marks their own board for Do Not Have in that colour.<br/><br/>The highest card of the colour lead wins the trick, unless a card is declared as red, the trump colour.<br/><br/>Crucially, all cards values and colours played out must be unique, otherwise a paradox is formed, ending the round.<br/><br/>So if a player is holding a 1,3,6, and yellow is lead, and only the yellow 1 remains open on the research board, the player is forced to play their 1 card as a yellow. But if that player has already claimed they Do Not Have yellow (as above), and if the other colours are also blocked on 1, 3 and 6, this causes a paradox. They cannot play, thus ending the round and triggering a scoring.<br/><br/>The player causing the paradox does not score and incurs penalty points also.<br/><br/>Scores are accumulated over the rounds, and the player with the highest total at the end is the winner.<br/><br/>Players must balance trying to win tricks to their bid with avoiding forming a paradox, forcing the round to end and incurring penalties.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

You are willing to assist each other and share your discoveries, but in the end, only one of you will become famous enough to be remembered throughout history.<br/><br/>Astra is a clever mix of tactics and strategy, with a streamlined and intuitive rule set that makes it easy to pick up and quick to play. A game of Astra consists of continuous player turns until a certain number of Constellation cards are taken, when, after an endgame scoring, the player with the most Fame points wins.<br/><br/>On your player turn, you may choose to either Observe or Rest.<br/><br/>The Observe action allows you to spend Stardust to discover stars on the Constellation cards using your dry erase marker. You may only mark stars in a straight continuous line, but you may spend Telescope tokens to start new observations. As soon as you mark the last star in a Constellation, you take the card from the Night Sky, granting you a powerful reusable ability for the rest of the game. But other players also benefit from the discovery: based on how many stars they marked, they may choose one of the card&rsquo;s instant benefits (Boons) at the time it is discovered.<br/><br/>The Rest action allows you to not only refill your Stardust up to your capacity, but also to reactivate all of your card abilities that match the currently active Sphere. Your card abilities are very powerful and strategy-enabling, so a well-timed Rest action can give you a huge advantage.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In addition 8 tokens are placed in the middle of the table. Spare tokens are set aside.<br/><br/>The deck is shuffled and each player is dealt one card face down, an additional card is dealt face up next to the deck (this card is called the Kobayakawa).<br/><br/>Each player takes a turn and either:<br/><br/>- Draws a card to their hand and discards one of their 2 hand cards face up in front of them.<br/>Or<br/>- Turns over the top card of the deck to replace the current Kobayakawa.<br/><br/>After all players have taken their turns, each must decide if they want to stay in and 'fight' by betting a token.<br/><br/>All players that decided to fight reveal their card. The player that has the lowest value card adds the value of the current Kobayakawa to their own card. The player with the highest number (their own card; or their own card + the Kobayakawa) wins the round and they take all the tokens that players bet, plus a bonus token from the middle, they take the start player token for the next round.<br/><br/>On the 7th round (when only 2 tokens remain in the middle) the stakes and the bonus are doubled to 2 tokens.<br/><br/>After this 7th round the game ends and the player with the most tokens wins the game.<br/><br/>Example Round:<br/>Kobayakawa: 8<br/>Player A: 9<br/>Player B: Pass<br/>Player C: 15<br/>Player D: 12<br/><br/>Player C has the highest card value (15), but Player A is declared the winner as the results of the lowest card (9) and the Kobayakawa (8) is 17.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players are kings (or queens) bidding for the services of six famous explorers -- Ferdinand Magellan, Christopher Columbus, Francisco Pizarro, Vasco da Gama, James Cook, and Marco Polo. As the game progresses, competition for the explorers' services increases as each explorer has fewer expeditions available for investment. In the end, only one ship for each explorer makes the final trip and only one king earns those rewards.<br/><br/>Firstly, the board is set up from two double-sided boards, giving four possible configurations with slightly different versions of each explorer. Each player has six ships and money cards numbered 1 to 9. There are three turns. In the first, each explorer has 3 ships, but only two of these will proceed to the second turn and only one will win through to the third.<br/><br/>A set of cards with explorers is used for each turn - 3 of each explorer in turn one, 2 of each in turn two and 1 of each in the last turn. The top card is revealed and an auction held, going round the table until all but one player has passed. The winning bidder puts the card in front of them and places one of their ships on to the relevant explorer area on the board. This process is repeated until all the cards have been bid on.<br/><br/>Each explorer has a different power, some giving victory points, others money or a special ability like being able to delay a subsequent auction, or a combination of these. At the end of a turn players gain two new money cards, plus any which explorers they have a ship on give them. The second turn work in the same way, but only players with a ship invested in an explorer can bid on it, and because there are only two ships of the three on each explorer moving to the second area, one will be left behind. Similarly, the third round sees just one ship of the remaining two move to the third and final area for each explorer. Scoring is then done, with more points available for players with ships reaching the third area.<br/><br/>Money is always tight so it is a good idea to try and get some extra income, though this conflicts with the need to score points. Two of the explorers score a lot of points but have no income so each player must balance the two needs. Money cards are worth points as well, so there is also a trade off between using these to win auctions to advance your ships and keeping them to score with.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When the first exploration vessels entered the cloudy atmosphere of the planet Magnastorm, they discovered not only evidence of abundant natural resources, but also the remains of a long-lost civilization. At the bidding of the magistracy, scout vehicles are lowered to the barren surface to search for suitable mining areas.<br/><br/>The goal of Magnastorm is to be the first player with a certain number of reputation points. You acquire reputation mostly through fulfilling objectives, taking control of one or more of the eight commanders, and building transmitter stations. The flow of the game is controlled by an action board with two action panels, each of which has five columns. At the start of each round, there are a 3-5 action tokens (crew members) standing in each column on the upper action panel. To carry out an action, a player:<br/><br/>A) takes an action token from the upper panel and places it on the lower action panel either to gain resources or to pay for a movement on the planet surface, or<br/> B) pays for every action token still standing in a certain column on the upper panel to gain control over the commander and his ability at the top of that panel, after which the player places those action tokens on the lower panel.<br/><br/>Since option A) will reduce the cost for option B), the players have to find the right timing for their actions. A round ends when the upper panel is empty. For the next round, the panels are swapped.<br/><br/>Magnastorm is a big, tactical board game with very little luck. Choose the right moment to perform actions or buy influence over helpful commanders. You will reap success through resource management, clever logistics, good timing, and a shrewd eye on the actions of your opponents. At the end of the game, each player receives one of 120 reward cards, which can be used in later games to compensate for varying levels of skill among the players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

In an effort to save the Hospital, you and your allies among its leading Physicians have staged a recent &ldquo;Clinical Coup&rdquo; and taken over the Hospital to restore its prestige. However, actually managing things from the inside is never as easy as it appears from the outside, and juggling the responsibilities at Healthy Heart Hospital can quickly turn even the noblest healer into a money-grubbing pragmatist cynically looking for a place to hide the victims of your &ldquo;care.&rdquo;<br/> Does your team have what it takes to bring Healthy Heart Hospital back to its former glory without becoming Hard Hearted in the process?<br/> Healthy Heart Hospital is a cooperative game for 1 to 5 players, played in rounds, with each player spending actions to treat and (hopefully) cure the various patients that come pouring into the hospital each round. Patients are represented by a number of cubes of various colors. Color represents the type of illness, while the number of cubes represents the severity of the illness.<br/><br/>",

Caesar Hadrian is no longer waging war against the barbarians, but building cities and fortifications to ensure a lengthy domination of the Roman culture and wealth.<br/><br/>The southern part of Britain is under Roman domination, and Caesar has already begun the construction of Hadrian's Wall to protect the empire from invasions from the North. Together with the wall, Caesar has ordered the founding of a new city that will remind the locals of the glory of Rome. He has appointed five of his most trusted men to take resources and workers from Rome and to build the city together &ndash; but in the end only one of them will be appointed Praetor and rule the Province in the name of Caesar.<br/><br/>In Praetor, you will take the role of a Roman engineer, and you will work together with the other players to build a magnificent city. You will manage your limited resources wisely and look for new ones, you will recruit new Workers while your old experienced ones will retire, you will build settlements to keep the population happy, and you will praise the Gods to earn their favor. Caesar will reward you if you give away precious resources to build Hadrian&rsquo;s Wall, thus increasing your chances of becoming Praetor.<br/><br/>Every turn, you will place your Workers on previously built City Tiles to gain resources, Morale, new Workers, or Favor points. You may also assign Workers to build new City Tiles or spend resources to meet Caesar&rsquo;s demands to gain Favor Points. At the end of each turn, you will have to pay your Workers. Otherwise, the mood in the city will deteriorate.<br/><br/>Most of the actions your Workers will perform will help them gain experience. They will become increasingly skilled in collecting resources. Your most experienced Workers will eventually retire and bring you additional Favor Points, but you will still have to show solidarity and pay them until the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

To start the game, you place all the chips in a bag.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player may draw chips until either (1) he chooses to stop or (2) he draws an animal that he has lying in front of him from a previous draw this turn. In this latter case, he returns all chips in front of him from the current turn to the bag, and the next player then takes his turn. In the former case, he stacks the chips in whatever order he wants on top of any chips he's collected in previous turns. (If a player has animals of only a single type, he can tuck them on the bottom of his stack.) Two special rules come into play while the player draws chips:<br/><br/><br/>     If a player draws an animal chip that matches the animal on top of an opponent's stack, the player can steal this animal, adding it to the chips currently in front of him. (If he busts for drawing a duplicate animal, this stolen chip is also returned to the bag.)<br/>     If a player draws a monkey, he can either keep the monkey (as with any other animal) or he can swap the monkey for the chip on top of an opponent's stack.<br/><br/><br/>When the last chip has been added to a stack, the game ends. Any player who has more chips of an animal type than any other player receives bonus points equal to the total number of that animal in the game. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

Balance your budget wisely, since taking too many bank bonds can ruin your business over the course of the game. Also, watch the competition closely because you can only use the track that you laid down personally to trade.<br/><br/>Since the island of Japan is mountainous and narrow there is often not enough space for everyone to lay their track where they want.

        "description": "Darjeeling has two main board areas.  The first is an array of squares representing one, two or three half-crates of tea in four different varieties (colors).  Each player has a marker which moves about in the array, picking up tea at the rate of one square per turn.  There are simple rules governing movement in this array and the players compete for the desirable squares.<br/><br/>Eventually, several times per game, each player has enough squares of a single color to fit them together so that the half-crates all make whole crates.  Now he can make a tea shipment.  This pays off in victory points in three different ways.  First, there is a &quot;demand&quot; award of up to 6 VP depending on how long it has been since anyone shipped this variety.  Second, if the shipment was of at least four crates, there is a flat bonus of 1 VP per crate.<br/><br/>Third and most pivotally, there are VP that will be awarded at the beginning of the player's next and subsequent turns.  Each tea shipment is represented with cubes of the player's color (not the tea variety color) on a sort of barge.  The new shipment of tea is always placed, in the other of the two main board areas, at the top of a column of all the recent shipments (the number of total shipments varying with the number of players in the game), so that as more shipments are made, the old shipments drift farther down the column and eventually out of play.  At the beginning of your turn, you look to see where your shipments are in this column, and they pay out VP with better multipliers the higher they still are in the column.  This constitutes the driving force of the game, as nobody else wants to see your shipment at the top of the column for several turns in a row.  Players thus have an incentive to make a shipment even if they haven't yet assembled a large number of crates.<br/><br/>It's a race to 100 points.  A runaway leader can easily take over if the rest of the table is not vigilant, so the best games of Darjeeling are those among vigilant players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After a long dark winter, the sun is shining and it's party time for the penguins, who celebrate by fishing. To look over the waters more easily, the penguins build high pyramids. The more penguins you can fit in the pyramid, the better &mdash; but it's not that easy.<br/><br/>In Penguin Party, players collectively build a pyramid of penguins, trying to empty their hands of cards along the way. The deck consists of 36 penguin cards: 8 green and 7 each of red, blue, yellow, and purple. Deal the deck out as evenly as possible, with the final card in a five-player game starting as the first card in the base of the pyramid.<br/><br/>On a turn, you either play a card to the left or right of the base of the pyramid, which can be at most eight cards wide, or play a card on a higher level of the pyramid so long as it's supported by two penguins, at least one of which is the same color as the card being played. If you cannot play a card, discard your hand face down and take as many penalty markers as the number of cards you didn't play. If you empty your hand, you can return two penalty markers previously collected to the supply.<br/><br/>Play as many rounds as the number of players, with each player starting one of the rounds. Whoever has the fewest penalty markers at the end of the game wins. (With two players, deal each player 14 cards, remove the other cards from play without looking at them, and build a pyramid with a base only seven cards wide.)<br/><br/>Admin note: This game looks very similar to Penguin, but differs not only in components (being a card game while Penguin has 3D penguin tokens), but also in the number of colors and distribution. Penguin has four colors with nine pieces each, while this game has five colors with a distribution of 4x7 + 1x8.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low).<br/><br/>Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players, and whoever ends with the highest score wins. In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if a Wizard or Jester (or no card in the final round) is revealed, then the round has no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.<br/><br/>The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.<br/><br/>After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.<br/><br/>After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.<br/><br/>A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.<br/><br/>Wizard: 20th Jubil&auml;umsedition is a special edition of Wizard that includes six cards not present in the normal game, including a single dragon card that beats a Wizard, a four-colored 7-1/2 Juggler card, and a bomb card that negates the bids for the round, with players then scoring points based on the total number of tricks they take.<br/><br/>",

As heads of influential families, the players strive to come to power with cunning and malice, power and strength, virtue and infamy. Their goal: the king's throne!<br/><br/>In the tactical card game, hidden cards are played in turn. By tactically uncovering and activating their effects, players can outdo or get them out of the way, because all players have the same goal in mind &mdash; to collect the most influence points for their family and thus win the game.<br/><br/>In Oriflamme Embrasement (second installment of the award winning game Oriflamme), the incendiary war threatens to bring the kingdom to the ground. But nothing will stop your house to conquer the throne by putting forward every inch of your famous lust for power and vengeance.<br/><br/>Oriflamme Embrasement offers 11 new action cards that can be mixed with Oriflamme or be used as a standalone.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>",

You must wait until a player activates that location (which activates it for all players on that location). Players are constantly facing important dilemmas: One dilemma is whether to claim a card or activate a location. Timing of the activation can be crucial. Another dilemma is whether to claim the card you really want or claim a less attractive card in order gain more publicity by joining players on another location.<br/><br/>The game comes with 35 uniquely illustrated star artist cards, cards with special powers (on the backs of the starting stage cards), 146 more cards, double-sided player boards with asymmetric powers on their backs, 90 printed meeples, 60 printed worker tokens, 18 printed flower power tokens, and much more.<br/><br/>Like all games in the Chilifox Games's catalog, the game works well with up to six players (with little downtime).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Doom Machine is an intense pressure-cooker card and dice mint tin solo game experience that fits in your pocket. Face off against an ever-evolving, ever-growing machine of death and destruction! Find and defeat the doom core before humanity is annihilated.<br/> Beware: the machine evolves, grows, and cycles each of its parts every turn. You must roll your dice with care, use abilities to modify the results as necessary, allocate dice to deal or block damage, and strategically destroy parts of the DOOM MACHINE to prevent your demise!<br/><br/>Each turn consists of two phases:<br/><br/>In Phase I, you'll roll your unlocked dice, using the limited available utility slots to modify or re-roll, then allocate dice to either shields (to block incoming damage) or to machine part cards in play (if the roll criteria is met) to deal damage to a part. Destroying parts earns you additional dice for future rolls.<br/><br/>In Phase II: The machine AI takes action, cycling the tracking die on each of its available machine part cards and triggering abilities when the die reaches an icon on its AI track -- potentially dealing damage, repairing, locking die, and impacting gameplay in other nefarious ways.<br/><br/>When all of the machine parts have completed their cycle, the entire line shifts down one slot and a new machine part is added to the doom machine line, increasing the difficulty with each turn.<br/><br/>Can you keep the machine at bay long enough to destroy the core and win?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Your genius could have been such a boon to humanity. Your death ray had wonderful pest control applications, and your volcano activator was perfect for fighting global warming. But the fools at the institute, they wouldn't listen. They called you mad! You built a monster to rend them limb from limb, which your minions assured you was the very worst way to be rended. When it became clear that the only hope for the world was your own benign leadership, you took control of TV to announce this fact. But your broadcast was interrupted by someone else taking control of TV and announcing his own plan for world domination &ndash; and then that broadcast was interrupted by yet another interloper. So. Competition. Well, the world will never be as scared of these upstarts as it will be of you. Archimedes once said, &quot;Give me a long enough lever and a place to stand, and I will move the world.&quot; You will be the most terrifying lever the world has ever seen.<br/><br/>Nefarious is a quick-playing game in which the players race to build inventions like a freeze ray, cloaking device, or robotic pet before their opponents can do the same. (Interesting side note: Eighteen different artists contributed to the artwork on the different inventions in the game.)<br/><br/>Nefarious is played over several rounds. In each round the players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their actions that will allow them to allocate one of their Minions to an area on their Lair, obtain money, obtain a blueprint for an invention, or build one of their inventions if they have enough money to do so. The minions that you allocate to your Lair can earn you additional income depending on the actions that your neighbors choose. The first player to build 20 or more points worth of Inventions AND have more points than any other player wins.<br/><br/>There is a twist to the game, though &ndash; actually, two twists! At the beginning of the game, you randomly draw two Twist cards, which change the environment so that the game plays differently each time. This means that in order to win, the players will have to revise their strategies each time they play Nefarious.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tantrix is a strategy game using painted synthetic resin hexagons (often mistakenly thought to be Bakelite). It was invented in New Zealand, and is clearly derived from the earlier Psyche-paths/Kaliko. Tantrix can be played as solitaire puzzles, ranging from easy to almost impossible, or as a multiplayer strategy game featuring a combination of strategy, luck and skill. Each tile has three tracks on it, in three different colors (out of four colors). Each track starts on one side of the tile and ends on another. The goal of the game is to create the longest line or loop of your chosen color. If you create a closed loop, each tile counts for two points.<br/><br/>Each player has an open hand of six tiles. When it is your turn, you must first play tiles in any spaces that are &quot;required play&quot; (any hole that has at least three tiles bordering it is a required play). After each played tile, you randomly draw a new tile. Once you've filled all required spaces, you play one tile in any legal space. After that, you once again need to fill required spaces. To play the game well, you need to create required spaces in smart ways. This way you can both enable yourself to play more tiles during your turn and force your opponent to play tiles that continue your track (remember that your opponent's hand is open, so try to create required spaces that take advantage of his tiles).<br/><br/>The full version contains 56 tiles.<br/><br/>Note that there are also smaller solo brain teaser puzzles that are Outside the Scope of BGG. The 10-tile version is a color matching puzzle. Arrange the tiles so that all the colored lines match where the tiles touch each other. Additionally, for each puzzle challenge, select one color, and create a closed loop. Begin the easy puzzle by using the first four tiles (which are numbered on the reverse side 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4). Increase the level of difficulty by adding the fifth tile, then 6th tile etc. Comes in Green &amp; Black.<br/><br/>Similar to:<br/><br/>    Tantrix Gobble<br/>    The Mind Game<br/>    Kaliko (Psyche-Paths)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Inspired by the hit video game that sold over 15 million copies worldwide, Monster Hunter World: The Board Game brings three &lsquo;M&rsquo;s and four &lsquo;C&rsquo;s to your tabletop: massive monster minis in a cooperative, choose-your-own-adventure-style combat campaign!<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s time to journey to an uncharted land, because the Astera basecamp needs YOU. Become a hunter of the Fifth Fleet to track down and slay the fearsome monsters roaming the New World. Protect basecamp and craft awesome new equipment with the loot collected from your fallen foes, so you can take on bigger and badder beasts! Gather your party of 1-4 hunters* and venture out on quests made up of three phases:<br/><br/><br/>         First is the gathering phase, where you&rsquo;ll trek through the lush jungles of the Ancient Forest&mdash;or the arid dunes and fetid swamps of the Wildspire Wastes&mdash;gathering resources and searching for a monster that could appear at any moment. Just like in the video game, the tabletop monsters can be wild and unpredictable, with changing moods and attack preferences. In this phase, you&rsquo;ll use a choose-your-own-adventure style quest book to determine what state you encounter the monster in and how you&rsquo;ll make your approach.<br/>         Next is the hunting phase, where you&rsquo;ll attempt to slay the monster in fluid and dynamic combat that makes full use of the board and miniatures to bring your experience to life.<br/>         And, finally, the HQ phase, where you&rsquo;ll craft new weapons and armour upgrades using the hard-won loot from your monster battles!<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>The choose-your-own-adventure element will immerse you in the New World, giving five unique ways to approach each monster before engaging in combat. Enjoy the beauty of the landscape as you would in the video game, and feel your tension build as you get deeper into the hunt&hellip; ...Because it&rsquo;s crush-or-be-crushed with monsters as mobile as these. Enter dynamic and dangerous combat where positioning and teamwork are vital to success. Leap away from devastating attacks and strike when the opportunity presents. It&rsquo;s vital you manage the threat, juggling which of your party members is drawing the monster&rsquo;s attention at any given moment. One wrong move could spell doom! Where you strike matters, too. Earn the loot you need for the weapons you want by targeting different areas of a monster and wearing it down over time.<br/><br/>Speaking of weapons, use your player board to track your health, stamina, and equipment. Just like in the video game, your weapon is essentially your hunter class, with a unique deck of cards and upgrades you can swap out by crafting to gain newer (and more powerful!) bonuses and attacks. As for using those weapons? Combat is controlled by cards which you&rsquo;ll use to create combos, meaning you&rsquo;ll string together attacks at the cost of stamina. Keep an eye on your stamina to balance your offensive and defensive moves, or you might find yourself caught out and crushed by a massive monster attack!<br/><br/><br/>    Want to play solo? No problem. Monster Hunter World: The Board Game includes solo mode, where you can control a pair of hunters and quest to your heart&rsquo;s content.  <br/><br/><br/>",

Negotiate, bluff, forge alliances, threaten your rivals &mdash; use every tool at your disposal to spread your influence, establish supremacy, and claim the ultimate prize: the Iron Throne!<br/><br/>In more detail, each turn centers around the resolution of an encounter between two players. These encounters can result in hostilities, startling conquests, and the spread of influence, or they can result in the formation of temporary alliances. And though only two players in any encounter will be the &quot;active&quot; players, your friends might offer you their support &mdash; or turn around and offer it to someone else.<br/><br/>The encounters of The Iron Throne resolve quickly, but they are full of opportunities for cunning strategy, devious intrigues, and brokered alliances. Each features a challenger and a defender, and after these players assign characters to resolve the encounter on the behalf of their Houses, other players may offer their support to either side. In this way, an encounter that starts as a contest between the Lannisters and the Starks may escalate and draw in the support of the Tyrells or other Houses.<br/><br/>However, there's more to the encounters of The Iron Throne than this initial jostling for power, even with all the alliances and betrayals it can entail. There are still schemes within schemes, and the bluffs, negotiations, and hidden information that color these encounters as the active players discuss the House cards they intend to play. Of course, there's a very good chance that one or both of them may be lying, but they can offer and even agree to a truce. Or they can bid cards from their hands, hoping to win hostilities with the higher total power.<br/><br/>In the event of a truce, the active players discuss what they may give each other in order to maintain the peace. In the event of hostilities, however, one side will win, and the other will suffer. You might seize influence or take hostages, or you may even have your characters put to the sword.<br/><br/>Win enough of these encounters, though &mdash; and find the right ones to lose &mdash; and you might find yourself in position to seize the Iron Throne. The goal of the game is to spread five of your influence to your opponents' House cards and take the crown for yourself.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1914, the great powers of Europe could not save the international system that had been in place since Metternich a century before. Tangled alliances pushed them to the brink. Nations miscalculated and expected a short, limited war, but a four-year World War blew up in their faces and forever changed the continent and the world.<br/>Great War Commander traces the war as the nations and empires fought it on the western front across Belgium and northern France. The forces of three major powers-France, Germany and America- all have forces in the game. One player handles Germany while the other side commands either France or America.<br/> Great War Commander (GWC) is a wargame based on the popular Combat Commander series created by Chad Jensen where two players take turns playing &ldquo;Fate cards&rdquo; in order to activate military units on the mapboard. GWC offers many new and unique elements to its parent system. The maps are deeper, allowing more playing surface to maneuver two battalion-size forces facing each other. There are several new orders, like Offensive, Runner, and Machine Gun Suppress, all reflecting the intense and blinded combat. There are over 30 actions including Engineering works, Go to Ground, and Rolling Barrage, highlighting earthen ties and powerful artillery. And there are 40 events dealing with experiences unique to the times, such as Tanks and Sturmtruppen. Among the new and many contemporary events are Trommelfeuer, High Command Meddling, Petard Raquette and Machine Gun Nest.<br/><br/>Great War Commander puts emphasis on the rigid top-down field command structure of the period with captains giving orders to lieutnants and NCOs which is new to the system. Besides the Fate Cards, there are Strategy Cards which factor in higher command and give a flavor and depth to the battles beyond that of the tactical level.<br/><br/>Players already familiar with the Combat Commander system will find a ready path to learning Great War Commander, at the same time discovering the one-off experiences of the Great War. There are some trenches to be sure, but there are many open field battles too. Barrages can alter terrain. Gas attacks can flood a sector. Air dominance or reconnaissance can influence the fighting.<br/><br/>Stand with the French at Verdun. Charge forward with the Germans in Belgium and at the Marne. Follow the Americans as they slug their way into and through Belleau Wood. GWC offers sixteen historical scenarios including one introductory scenario for players not yet familiar with the general game system, a three players scenario and four scenarios with tanks. The replay value is high and the dedicated Random Scenario Generator adds endless hours of play. Hexasim will expand GWC in upcoming sequels covering British, Russians, Austrians, Turks and Great War actions in Africa .<br/><br/>",

It is not for a specific product or release. Versions will appear on the individual item pages.<br/><br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Battleground: Fantasy Warfare is a point-based table-top tactical wargame in which units are represented by cards instead of a collection of figures or models. We bring you all the charging, flanking and intricate maneuvering of a great wargame in a convenient package for a fraction of the cost.<br/><br/>As the general of a fantasy army of Men, Orcs, Elves or whatever faction you choose, you will muster your forces and command them in battle.  You will have an agreed-upon number of points to spend on your army, which will determine the size of the battle.  You and your opponent will then take turns deploying your forces on the battlefield.  Finally you will give them their orders and the battle begins.<br/><br/>During play you will have a limited number of Command Actions each turn &ndash; one for every 500 points available for building your army.  These Command Actions represent what you can do as a general.  You can spend them to change a unit&rsquo;s orders or take direct control of a unit for a turn, rally routed units, draw cards that can provide small combat bonuses or to use your special army ability.<br/><br/>Unlike most tabletop wargames where you have complete control over every soldier&rsquo;s actions, Battleground puts you in the role of a true general.  Your troops are loyal and will obey your orders but you can&rsquo;t be everywhere so you have to spend your resources carefully!<br/><br/>",

Each round, players choose one of these and reveal them simultaneously.<br/><br/>If two or more players chose the same card, these cards cancel. Otherwise the card effects are resolved. They affect each players magical orb - a d12.<br/><br/>After all cards are resolved, the values of the dice are compared. If two players have the same value on their die, they cancel. The remaining player with the highest value on their die wins the round and gets two points. The second most also gets one point.

Now it&rsquo;s up to you to help Doc and Marty repair the space-time continuum before time paradoxes unravel the very fabric of the universe. Jump in your time machine, complete events, return items, and help! The future is in your hands!<br/><br/>In this cooperative dice game, you&rsquo;ll take control of a DeLorean and travel through the entire Back to the Future film trilogy, completing memorable events and returning key items to their proper place and time before the OUTATIME tracker reaches &ldquo;Game Over.&rdquo; Each round, you and your fellow players will roll dice to determine your actions, which include time travel, moving meddling members of the Tannen family, and more.<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll use your dice to complete events form the films. Once an event is complete, you&rsquo;ll draw an item card, which you&rsquo;ll need to return by traveling to the year and location listed on the card. Then, the OUTATIME tracker is reduced&mdash;buying you more time&mdash;and you earn an Einstein token. Einstein tokens provide one action anyone can use later. In a pinch, you can even &quot;ripple&quot; dice by placing them on your space the board, allowing other players in future years to pick them up and use them!<br/><br/>After everyone has taken their actions, advance the OUTATIME tracker depending on which year has the most unsolved events. Finally, add Paradox tokens to all unsolved events on the board. In later rounds, these will cause the OUTATIME tracker to go up even faster! Return all the items before the OUTATIME tracker reaches &ldquo;Game Over&rdquo; to win!<br/><br/>",

That said, many different paths can be experienced during play, with more than one correct resolution to the story waiting to be discovered. Each title consists of three chapters, each taking about 75 minutes to play. Nothing is destroyed, so the games can be played multiple times.<br/><br/>In Adventure Games: Grand Hotel Abaddon, you want to discover what strange events are happening in the old building, slipping into your role on the team to follow tracks and decide how the adventure game should proceed.<br/><br/>",

Be the first player to empty your hand to score points based on whichever one of ten scoring cards are in use this round.<br/><br/>The game contains 38 tiles: 36 numbered tiles with one 1, two 2s, etc. up to eight 8s, along with a tiger and a dragon. Shuffle the tiles face down, then each player takes tiles based on the player count, with the round's starting player taking one additional tile. With four players, for example, the starting player draw ten tiles and all other players nine. At least one tile will remain out of play.<br/><br/>The start player attacks by playing a tile from their hand. The next player can either pass or defend the attack by playing the same tile. Note that the dragon defends against any odd-numbered tile and the tiger against any even-numbered tile. After defending, place a tile of your own to attack. If a player passes, the next player either passes or defends. If all other players pass on your attack, place a tile from your hand face down, then choose a new tile to attack again. If you attack with the dragon or tiger, a player can defend with any odd- or even-numbered tile, respectively.<br/><br/>The first player to empty their hand wins the round and scores points based on the last tile that they played and the specific scoring card for that round. They score 1 bonus point for each time an attack of theirs went undefended. At the end of a round, if a player has scored 10+ points, they win.<br/><br/>Tiger &amp; Dragon is based on the popular Japanese traditional game GOITA, and it can be played with team rules like that earlier team. Teammates sit across from one another, and the first team to collectively score 15+ points wins.<br/><br/>",

The players (leaders of a royal Egyptian family) choose their sites, build their pyramids, and thank Amun-Re and the other gods for their bounty.<br/><br/>In Amun-Re, each pharaoh wants to build the most pyramids. To accomplish this, they must first acquire a province where they can trade and farm. With their profits, they can buy new provinces and building stones to erect pyramids. For all their actions, players must make clever use of their power cards and always offer appropriate sacrifices to Amun-Re.<br/><br/>Amun-Re: 20th Anniversary Edition features new modules that can be added to the game:<br/><br/><br/>    Officials Variant: The Officials variant can only be played with two or three players. It gives players an additional Scribe for bidding. Each round players will bid for two provinces, keeping control of just one and gaining the Officials card from the other. The Officials cards offer exciting instant bonuses.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Afterlife Expansion: The Afterlife expansion adds a fourth item you can buy in the market phase - Tomb tiles. Players place the tiles into their own personal pyramid shape, starting with a base of up to five tiles. Each placed tile gives the player a bonus, and this bonus is multiplied if the tile is placed on top of matching tiles within the pyramid. At the end of the game, each completed row of tiles is worth points.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Statues Expansion: In each of the first three rounds, grand statues are added to certain provinces. These statues each grant unique powers to the player who controls the province in which they are built. This expansion adds extra interest to the auction phase and gives players their own player powers that may vary each time. The statues will be miniatures representing Egyptian gods.<br/><br/><br/><br/>    Pharaoh Mini Expansion: This mini expansion adds tension to the auction phase by rewarding players for overbidding other players. The Pharaoh moves to each province that is overbid, and at the conclusion of the auctions the player who wins the province with the Pharaoh receives a token that grants extra rewards in the subsequent offerings phase.<br/><br/><br/>",

Many companies have a destination station and receive a large part of their working capital only if they have connected this station to their route network. The game also features mountain railways, tunnels, private companies and two different types of locomotives, providing for lots of variation for railway enthusiasts and lovers of complex games.<br/><br/>A special feature of 1854, set in Austria, is located in the stock split, which comes into play in the additional shares.

        "description": "A Game of the War in the East: 1941-44.<br/><br/>Russian Front is a wargame that re-creates the ebb and flow of the largest, longest and most costly military campaign of World War II. The game covers the vast theater of operations and the massive forces employed by the Soviet Union and by Nazi Germany and her allies. Only this time, YOU are in command.<br/><br/><br/>    Alternate scenarios: Games can be played that start in May or June of 1941, in 1942, or in 1943.<br/>    Unique Combat system: Combat occurs within a hex, units take incremental losses, and battles can require more than one round of resolution.<br/>    Land, Air, and sea: Units are included for and battles occur in all combat environments.<br/>    Blitz Attacks: Armor units may breakthrough fronts to drive deep into enemy territory.<br/>    Variable Endings: End any game at the conclusion of a six month period or continue on to the end of the campaign.<br/><br/><br/>The Basic rules allow players to quickly start playing the game and mastering the system. The Advanced and Optional rules allow players to choose the levels of complexity and detail that they enjoy.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE: One month per turn. <br/>MAP SCALE: Twenty-five miles per hex. <br/>UNIT SCALE: Corps, armies, fleets, and flotillas. <br/>PLAYERS: Two. <br/>PLAYING TIME: From two to eighteen hours, depending on the scenario and rules used.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tScenariosIncluded in the game are three scenarios: 1941, 1942, and 1943.  The Barbarossa scenario also has an early start option with some historically plausible options for allowing this.  The '42 scenario, while historical, is quite imbalanced in favor of the Axis player.  Is a great way to practice the Summer '42 turns though so it is certainly recommended.  Finally is the '43 scenario.  This is imbalanced in favor of the Soviet player and is essentially Barbarossa in reverse.  It is very, very important that players practice this one.  It is the best way to learn the strengths of the Soviet side.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tConsolidated RulebookThe Avalon Hill Game Company (TAHGC) quickly released a few important errata for the printed game.  This was released in GENERAL 22-4.  Then, two years later, extensive errata was released in GENERAL 24-1.  Both of these are available for download in the 'files' section below.  However, a new digital rulebook is available for download with all errata already incorporated.  This is also available in the 'files' section.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tThe Wargame Academy Tournament RulesVarious rules are subject to interpretation.  The stated goal of the Wargame Academy is to provide a tournament rulebook where interpretive rules are explicitly stated with only one ruling.  This will enable tournament play.

To that end custom map extensions have been designed by more than one player.  The VASSAL module now has map extensions available as an option for play.  West to Berlin, Northeast to Archangel, and Southeast to Baku are all included.  Later these extensions will be available for download in a printable file.<br/><br/>(additional information by user JokerRulez)<br/><br/>",

Was also included in the 2nd Edition of the rules, released in 1981, and is incorporated in to the 3rd Edition Rulebook.<br/><br/>XII: Marengo The Italian Campaign of 1800.  This, the 12th official scenario, was released in General Vol. 26 Issue 6.  It is incorporated in to the 3rd Edition Rulebook<br/><br/>XIII: From Montenotte to Rivoli - Bonaparte's First Command: The Italian Campaign of 1796-97 A Scenario By Tom Cundiff.  This scenario was included in Fire &amp; Movement Issue No. 146<br/><br/>XIV: The Army of the Orient - Bonaparte in Egypt 1798-99 A Scenario By John Gant.  **Development Now Complete.  To be included in the Sequel to War and Peace**<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tCampaign GameThe Campaign Game had Naval Rules, and Diplomatic rules that deviated from and altered the structure used for the other scenarios.  Some players complained of ambiguities in these rules and the Campaign Game became known as difficult to play, and unbalanced for 2 players to play.  Some commented that the Campaign Game felt &quot;tacked on&quot; to an otherwise excellent collection of scenarios.  General Vol. 23 Issue 4 provided official rules to help with the 2 player Campaign Game.  However, regarding the Naval Rules, an official correction (2nd Edition Rules of '81) would further complicate matters until the game designer released his own update in General Vol. 19. Issue 5.  The Campaign Game was further altered for &quot;more realism&quot; by an article in General Vol. 31 Issue 2.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t3rd Edition GameThis Unofficial 3rd Edition of the Rules compiles and reconciles all of the differences in the rules, as published by Avalon Hill over the years.  Comprised from the 1st Edition Rulebook, Errata, 2nd Edition Rulebook, 3rd Edition Naval Rules (Official), Q&amp;A, and Misc. released by Avalon Hill through the years, the 3rd Edition Rulebook is the definitive edition.  Also included are all official variants and optional rules.  Available now for download in the 'Files' section of this page.  This effort embraced the official work almost exclusively.  The 4th Edition will attempt to fix some of the issues in the official work.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\t4th Edition Game Available NowThe Unofficial Mapboard, in support of the comprehensive rulebook and titled the 4th Edition Mapboard, is now available. 1st Edition Mapboard was the initial release.  Some suggestions for updates were made so that is considered the 2nd Edition (for those who used whiteout on the 4th river of Kiev).  The brand new map was the 3rd Edition.  The 4.0 version, where unofficial work is involved, is available now on the VASSAL web site as part of the module and as a PDF for printing.<br/><br/>The 4th Edition Rulebook is specific to the 4th Edition Mapboard and has significant unofficial work to fix various issues.  The primary focus of the 4th Edition was the new map and the Grand Campaign Game.<br/><br/>",

It is built upon the cooperative board game model and the players will work together against the game itself.<br/><br/>In the game, players assume the roles of Kirk, Spock, Bones and Uhura. The premise is the Federation has received a petition for membership from a planet and the Enterprise is dispatched to assess their application. When the Enterprise arrives, they discover:<br/><br/><br/>     A Klingon battle cruiser is in orbit;<br/>     Civil war is threatening to break out on the planet;<br/>     And the planet is (coincidentally?) reconsidering its application for UFP membership.<br/><br/><br/>Your mission is threefold; defuse the threat of civil war, deal with the Klingon threat and get the planet to join the UFP. And you only have 30 days (roughly equaling 30 turns) in which to do it, or a Klingon battle fleet will warp in and you will be forced to withdraw (thus failing your mission).<br/><br/>Each objective is tracked on a scoresheet that monitors your progress. Decisions you make in the game as well as how you interact with the other players will affect the outcome of the mission.<br/><br/>The four figures are fully rendered, 3D versions of the four Bridge officers. The four figures and two spaceships are similar to Heroclix figures, with the clicks on the dials at the base of the figure representing damage and corresponding diminished abilities.<br/><br/>This product is designed as a non-collectible, non-blind, all-in-one-and-done game, but is built upon the &quot;expandable&quot; board game model meaning that down the line, new missions and crew members will be made available for folk to play other &quot;episodes&quot;!<br/><br/>",

Any of his people may go up to Jerusalem in Judah to build the temple of the Lord, the God of Israel. And in any place where survivors may now be living, the people of Persia are to provide them with silver, gold, goods, livestock, and offerings for the temple of God in Jerusalem. - Ezra 1:2-4 (paraphrased).<br/><br/>Decades later, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes reign, the king noticed a sadness in his cupbearer, Nehemiah. When asked why he looked so ill, Nehemiah replied:<br/><br/>May the king live forever! Why should I not look sad when the city of my ancestors lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire? If it pleases you, and if I have found favor in your sight, let me go to the city in Judah where my ancestors are buried so that I may rebuild it. - Nehemiah 2:3-5 (paraphrased).<br/><br/>The aim of Ezra and Nehemiah is to be the player with the most victory points (VP) at game's end. Points are gained primarily by building the temple, rebuilding the city walls and gates, and by teaching the Torah to the returning exiles. Players may also seek to develop their land, travel to settlements outside the city walls, or stoke the altar's fire to keep it burning day and night. The prophets Haggai and Zechariah will be doing their part to keep the people focused on what is most important.<br/><br/>Over three weeks (rounds), players will use their hand of cards, workers, and resources to do their part in rebuilding the great city of Jerusalem. After six days of work comes a Sabbath day of rest when food will be needed, and the week's work will be reflected upon. The game ends after the third Sabbath has been completed.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The saber-toothed tiger clan is looking for a new leader, but which one of you can best take care of the clan in Honga and prove to be the most worthy leader?<br/><br/>There are multiple ways to prove your worth: gather supplies, comb through the dark forest, pay homage to the old nature gods, attract mammoths, and successfully trade with other clans. But! No matter how busy you are with these tasks, you can never forget Honga! Whenever you ignore the local saber-toothed tiger, he will come and eat your food &mdash; and getting rid of him can turn out to be tough.<br/><br/>Honga is an action selection resource management game for 2-5 players, age 8+, set in the prehistoric period. Players take turns playing their action card to the central board, paying careful attention to where they place it, and how it's rotated. The number of hands pointing to an action space determines how many times you may use that action. Gather resources and use them to complete trade agreements, lure mammoths to the tribe herd, and pay homage to the old nature gods. But! If you don't make sure that at least one action point is allocated to Honga's den, he'll come steal food from you! Players must balance between keeping Honga at bay and using their limited action points effectively.<br/><br/>With multiple paths to victory, light player interaction, and a 45 minute play time, this game will have you coming back again and again to play with Honga, the local saber-tooth tiger that's really just a big kitty at heart.<br/><br/>",

Cards that are replaced from a player's train line are put in the middle to be used as special powers, and the cards that are used as special powers are discarded. Special powers include such actions as swapping two cards, moving a card, destroying everyone's cards, and so on. The players keep taking turns until one has their train line in ascending order and wins.<br/><br/>",

What are you waiting for? Get shipping!<br/><br/>SpaceShipped &mdash; A solo space trading game of buying and selling resources, upgrading your ship, crew, and equipment, dealing with pirates, and making deals. A card game with over 30 random events, 4 types of ship, 4 sets of crew members, and 8 different pieces of equipment to install, all using only 18 cards packed neatly in a little wallet.<br/><br/>Your goal: Make enough money through your buying and selling of resources to be able to afford two very expensive exotic stones (three, if you're really daring). At the same time you're trying to do it, pirates are working hard to collect them as well. If they get to them first, or if your ship takes enough damage, you lose.<br/><br/>As if the pressure from the pirates wasn't enough, on each turn, you'll pilot your ship to different planets, experiencing random encounters, solar winds, and violent attacks. Spend too much time repairing your ship and the pirates will steal the crystals first, but don't repair your ship enough and it will likely be destroyed by these attacks. Hire the right crew, buy the right ship, fit your ship with the right equipment, and you just might make it out of the galaxy alive.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/><br/>Released in the July 2019 Board Game of the Month Club $20+ package.<br/><br/>",

This strategic railroad game extends from the first of America's railroads through the golden age of steam, where pioneering rail barons knit together the fledgling United States with iron roads, realizing the full power of the nation's mighty heartland. Each player takes the roles of railroad presidents and their wealthy investors, betting that their capital gambles will pay off handsomely. Baltimore and Ohio is not a game of luck or chance, but a competitive struggle of wits, savvy and guile. With the resources at hand, should you focus on further expansion, technological breakthroughs or emerging markets? This modern classic has all the challenges faced by the empire building capitalists that created a superpower.<br/><br/>Eddie Robbins' Baltimore &amp; Ohio is a no luck, no auctions, 3+ hour, grand strategic economic slugfest of a train game, for 3-6 players. It was part of the Winsome Games' 2009 Essen Set, has been licensed to Eagle Games and will be released by Eagle in 2010.<br/><br/>The railroads in the game are:<br/>Baltimore &amp; Ohio<br/>Boston &amp; Maine<br/>Chesapeake &amp; Ohio<br/>Erie<br/>Illinois Central<br/>New York Central<br/>New York, Chicago &amp; Saint Louis (aka Nickel Plate)<br/>New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford<br/>Pennsylvania<br/>Wabash<br/><br/>",

The survival of humanity itself is at stake!<br/><br/>In Infection: Humanity's Last Gasp, by designer John Gibson, you are the director of the Department of Plague Control (DPC) field office in New York City.

They were called COMUNI. The relationship among them was a more or less a pacific coexistence but the cultural, military and Economic competition was always very high.<br/>In this game each player rules a particular COMUNE and has to increase the wealth of the city. To do this he must build structures that are the core of the Economic, Military, Cultural and Religious life.<br/>At the same time all the player must be aware of the invasion that can come from outside and if necessary must be able to collaborate to defeat them.<br/><br/>Comuni is a game of strategy. The core of the game is trying to acquire &quot;projects of buildings&quot; (cards) that can be automatically transformed in buildings and protection walls (and subsequent upgrades).<br/>The acquisition of the projects is made through a bidding system.<br/>The buildings can be of four types (Economic, Military Cultural and Religious) that give different resources. The resources give different advantages during the game in the bidding phase, when you transform projects into buildings etc....<br/>The projects cards are divided in four different decks, at the end of each of them, an invasion comes, each time stronger. The invasion hits all players and during the invasion each player must defend his city. The players also can (and have an incentive to) collaborate to fight the aggression together.<br/>At the end of the four invasions the game ends.<br/>The key element of this game is the ability to plan a successful strategy predicting what will be the situation several turns in advance.<br/><br/>",

This base game features four new Classes, including the Cultist, and a lot of classic monsters from outside reality &ndash; and they all have Stuff you can take from their twitching bodies. You can play Munchkin Cthulhu by itself, or combine it with any number of other Munchkin titles for mind-bending silliness.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>",

Every cyclist enjoys the benefits of a free base movement which varies according to his specialty and according to the hexagon at the beginning of his movement. After this kind of movement every racer can add a paying movement. Therefore, the race is based on the riders' energy management: initially the riders are all inside the peloton, where it is easier to save energy, but then they will have to find the proper moment to break away to open the definitive gap ahead of the peloton.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Hell of the North&quot; is a slang term for a one-day bicycle race originally from Paris to Roubaix that includes many sections of cobbled roads, sections that often lead to damaged bikes, falls and unexpected race results. A mix of new terrain, including cobblestoned sections, is included in the game with forty new tracks on twenty hexagonal tiles. New miniatures are included that match the size of those in the original game, and the game includes &quot;new rider characteristics&quot;, according to Ghenos' Alfredo Genovese, to go with the miniatures.

        "description": "Hidden inside the sinners&rsquo; pit of the antique library are cursed tomes, heretical books, treatises on witchcraft and black magic, and precious volumes of Kabbalah, all of them written in strange and lost languages. Each book has been placed precisely in the pit, positioned according to exacting rituals; their function to prevent chaos from emerging from the pit. The Keeper is entrusted to stop the souls of the damned from escaping - something they attempt continuously - by touring the labyrinth and keeping the power contained in the books strong enough to seal the abyss. Only the Keeper knows the rituals and the exact position of every volume as he&rsquo;s the sole person with access to the Sator secrets.<br/><br/>SATOR AREPO TENET OPERA ROTAS is the seal that keeps the souls of the damned from flowing away...<br/><br/>But the power of the old Keeper is waning, and the sinners&rsquo; pit has felt this, using the breath of the damned to slowly shift the volumes which compose the Sator across the labyrinth in order to open a passage for their souls into our world.<br/><br/>Thus, the four Acolytes of the Keeper have been entrusted to recover the holy books that have been moved across the labyrinth. Each volume contains a key which lets one understand some of the arcane words of the Sator and thereby regain control of the labyrinth. The Acolyte who first recovers the four holy books that the Keeper has asked him to find will be able to access the Sator and become the new Keeper.<br/><br/>Goal<br/><br/>Each player represents an Acolyte and tries to be the first to recover the four books that the Keeper has entrusted to him (the four books in the color of his pawn). <br/>The sinners&rsquo; pit is an intricate labyrinth of Footbridges and mobile walkways that can be moved by gears and pulleys. They can be turned and pushed in order to create a safe path over which the Acolyte may safely walk the abyss.<br/><br/>To move Footbridges, each Acolyte may read from the book Incertus Movet in Aere Sospeso', which is a kind of user&rsquo;s manual explaining how to manipulate the walking passages to meet his needs. The more Footbridges the Acolyte moves during his turn, the farther he will be able to walk.<br/>What&rsquo;s more, he will be able to use the content of his own Liber Fidei, a set of prayers, thoughts and ascetic books, to perform apparently impossible actions (such as the manipulation of time and space) thanks to the power of his faith...<br/><br/>",

Between 1945 and 1960, the British fought four major &ldquo;emergencies&rdquo;, as they referred to their counterinsurgency campaigns, each trying to manage their retreat from empire. The four games in this pack focus on exploring British counterinsurgent responses to a variety of different opponents, including communist insurgents in Malaya, militant nationalists in Kenya, and smaller and more clandestine terrorist organizations in Palestine and Cyprus. The games adjust the core COIN mechanics to provide a compelling new way of handling two-player conflicts, while also streamlining several mechanics to quicken gameplay. The British Way offers an approachable introduction to the COIN series for new players, while presenting experienced players with four mechanically distinct games to explore and compare.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rolling America, based on the 2014 release Rolling Japan, is a light &quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot; dice game. Each player has a map of the United States that's divided into fifty (abstractly represented) states, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild clear die. All players now write down each number rolled on any state of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue state and a 2 in one yellow state. If the clear die is rolled, you can place this number in a state of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-clear die as any color. However, neighboring states can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a state of the appropriate color. (If all the states in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)<br/><br/>Rolling America has a few changes from Rolling Japan. The &quot;guard&quot; action allows you to ignore the neighboring number restriction three times during the game, and the &quot;dupe&quot; action allows you to use one of the active dice twice in the same region. As in real life, Alaska and Hawaii are not connected to the continental United States, so you can drop any numbers you want in those states!<br/><br/>After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round. After eight rounds the game ends, and whoever has the fewest Xs on their map wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pass with care...<br/><br/>Many are the paths to power: brute force, subtle deception, cunning trickery. You hold the cards...but you can't keep them all. What will you decide to collect for personal gain? And what are you willing to give up in order to destroy? The Ravens are gathering, many of whom used to be rivals. Will you rise to power or simply be...nevermore.<br/><br/>Nevermore is a casual-style, card-drafting game in which you quickly build your hand each round, collecting cards you want and poisoning your opponent's hand by passing along cards you think they can't use. Whoever holds the most of a given suit, gains the power of that suit to attack, heal, acquire Light or Shadow magicks and score victory points.<br/><br/>Will you transform all your rivals into ravens &mdash; or can they regain their human form in time to score enough victory to win?<br/><br/><br/>Nevermore can be taught in less than five minutes, yet hides a surprising amount of depth in strategy, as players try to outwit and outmaneuver their opponents. Player &lsquo;transformation&rsquo; replaces player elimination, keeping everyone in the game until the last moment, yet still rewards players who have performed better during the game. That's because a player who has become a Raven cannot win until they can find a way to transform back, but they still play, helping to doom other players and trying to collect one of two specific hands (all of one suit - or - one of every suit) to become human again.<br/><br/>Short game length encourages multiple plays per session and appeals to players of all skill levels &ndash; with plenty of underhanded plotting and backstabby goodness.<br/><br/><br/>Play Overview:<br/><br/>Players are dealt a hand of 5 cards - but they will not keep them all.<br/>During the drafting phase, players must pass three of those cards to the player on their left. From their new set of five, they must then pass two to the left. Lastly, they will pass one card left - ending the drafting phase with a final drafted hand of five cards. They will have attempted to collect cards from a certain suit (or two) trying to be the player who has the most of that suit this hand - and also carefully managing what they are passing to their opponent, to make sure they don't end up with too powerful a hand.<br/><br/>During the resolution phase, each suit is called for, one at a time. All players show cards from that suit simultaneously. The player with the most gains the power of the suit - and the strength of the ability is determined by subtracting the second highest total of that suit. Example: I hold three Attack cards. Two other players each hold one Attack card. (3-1=2) I do a 2 point attack on a player I choose. Healing, Victory points and Radiance (which draws a Light Magick card for each you have minus the second highest amount) all work the same way. All but Ravens, who kill cards of other suits in your hand. Example: I have 3 Victory, 1 Attack and 1 Raven. I must choose to sacrifice either 1 Attack or 1 Victory card from my hand as they are Resolved. Certain special hands give additional benefits and/or Victory points.<br/><br/>If your 5 Health points drop to 0, you become a Raven, still in the game, but unable to win until you can transform back.<br/><br/>The winner is either the last human player standing - or the first to score 6 Victory points.<br/><br/>",

As part of the Livingston Exploration, strategically set up tents in various regions while collecting gems found along the Zambezi River bank. Gain the most victory points and the favor of Queen Victoria to win!<br/><br/>From the publisher: In this game you follow in the footsteps of David Livingstone to the roaring Victoria Falls. On your way you may want to try your luck in the Diamond mining or you may prefer to seek a more calculable risk.<br/><br/>The publisher promises an exciting and tactical family game, with a completely new dice mechanism.<br/><br/>Gameplay overview:<br/><br/>In Livingstone, the players travel through the river Zambezi and score points by making explorations to inland and finding valuable diamonds.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, players roll dice (2 per player), which determine where or in which quantity the actions the players take in the round will happen. Starting with the starting player for the current turn, the players pick dice (and take actions) clockwise one at a time. This is done until all the dice are distributed or nobody can pick another die; you can only ever pick a die that has a higher face value than the previous die you picked.<br/><br/>When picking a die, players can choose between four actions:<br/><br/>     Take one special card (regardless of the die value); the special cards give players extra actions, bonuses and more; on the other hand, players can pick up a card that collapses the mine - in this case all the players lose their saved diamonds<br/>     Take money (amount is determined by the die value)<br/>     Take diamonds (values 0&ndash;5, amount determined by the die value) from the bag; if you pick the white stone, you lose all diamonds you picked up this round<br/>     Explore and set up a tent (row determined by the dice value); this costs players money<br/><br/><br/>Additionally, the players can do the following actions at any time of their turn for free:<br/><br/>     Sell diamonds for money<br/>     Contribute coins to the Queen; you have to inform other players you are doing this, but you do not have to specify the value - coins are stored in a chest in secret<br/><br/><br/>At the end of the turn, the boat is advanced (one column) further in the Zambezi river. The game ends when the boat cannot advance (eg. it has reached the last row).<br/><br/>The players score points in two different ways:<br/><br/>     At the end of each turn, the current column is scored; each tent in a row scores the row amount (die/row value = amount of points)<br/>     At the end of the game, each row is scored; the player with the majority of tents in each row scores points (lower die/row numbers score more points)<br/><br/><br/>The player who has contributed the least amount of money to the Queen cannot win the game, even if they collected the most points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Band of Brothers: Ghost Panzer is a fast playing game of squad level combat in WWII. It covers the exploits of the German 11th Panzer Division in Russia from 1941 to 1944. The rules are very simple (no combat charts are needed) with very few exceptions to remember and yet the game is meant to be all encompassing and will include infantry, tanks, and artillery.<br/><br/>Based on years of research, the game system uses a unique suppression mechanic. There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression. This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something. You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.<br/><br/>Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops. Their goal is to fire and maneuver. Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close. The system itself forces this realistic play. In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.<br/><br/>Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.<br/><br/>Ghost Panzer is a STAND ALONE GAME, but is also the second in a series.<br/><br/>Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles was the first in the series and followed the U.S. 101st Airborne Division.<br/><br/>Other games under research are &quot;The Old Breed&quot; (the US 1st Marine Division) and a module that follows Commonwealth forces.<br/><br/>Other Key Links:<br/><br/>Designing a Division<br/><br/>",

With each roll you must first set aside any Tanks, representing the human military coming to fend off your alien invasion. Then you may choose one type of die to set aside as well - one of the earthlings to abduct, or Death Rays to combat the military. At the end of your turn, if you have at least as many Death Rays as Tanks, then you may abduct the earthlings you've been setting aside. You can't pick any type of Earthling twice in one turn, but if you manage to abduct at least one of each you'll score a bonus!<br/><br/>With each roll you will ask yourself, do you feel lucky?<br/><br/>",

During the game, you will move your workers around Manhattan, raising buildings and skyscrapers. To prove your skill, climb atop the tallest building and look down over the city you have built. Only clever tactical moves and cards will bring you victory.<br/><br/>In this 2-5 player abstract strategy game, you'll control 2 workers while all building New York City. Each turn consists of a move and a build, but special Role Cards impact how you play your turn. Each player will have 5 Role Cards, choosing one to play at the beginning of each turn. Once used, it is discarded, which continues until each player only has 1 Role Card left. 4 more are dealt to each player to provide more options.<br/><br/>The first player to move to the third level wins the game, however they must have the Statue of Liberty when they do in order to win. Each Role Card has a number printed on it, showing it's initiative order. Role cards are simultaneously revealed each round, and the player with the lowest number goes first. The player with the highest number takes the Statue of Liberty, and is the only player who can win on that turn, creating an intense and dynamic 'all vs 1' environment every turn.<br/><br/>The game comes with 14 Role Card sets, but only 4 are used each game, providing a large amount of replayability. The game also comes with 6 custom sculpts of the world-record breaking skyscrapers at the turn of the century.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Neuland is a game about logistics and planning.  In the beginning of the game, the land lies undeveloped, a series of blank hexes representing mountains, forests, and grasslands.  Players win by building and using prestige properties that allow them to place their family's coat-of-arms onto the board -- first to place all their coats of arms wins.<br/><br/>To use these buildings, though, requires the player have the correct raw materials.  Swords and cloth, for example, or coins and paper.   Each one of these materials needs even more basic materials, such as iron ore, coal, and so on backward toward the most basic elements such as food, wood, and stone.<br/><br/>To cull these materials from the land, one builds buildings -- a Stonecutter's Hut, Smelter, Coin Manufactury, and so on.  Once on the board, buildings can be used by any player, not just the one who built them.<br/><br/>A player doesn't collect these resources for safekeeping as in The Settlers of Catan or Keythedral.  Instead, resources claimed via buildings must be used up either in the player's current turn or his next one.  If he doesn't, the resources spoil and are removed from the board.<br/><br/>Essentially, the challenge of the game is one of planning logistical supply chains which will allow one to process these resources most efficiently to build the prestige properties the fastest.  Since it's a perfect information game, one can also see what one's opponents are scheming, and place workers to interrupt their supply chains, possibly causing their resources to spoil and making the player start from zero again.<br/><br/>Neuland's most interesting innovation is perhaps its Time Track Mechanism, in which players who take less actions in a turn will have turns more frequently, and can forward-plan in order to take a long turn of nearly twenty actions instead of the ordinary maximum of ten.<br/><br/>Neuland was originally published by eggertspiele in 2004, and republished by Z-man in 2006 with some significant rules changes.  A majority of BGG users seem to strongly prefer the original eggertspiele rules. Also heavily recommended is the rules re-write file available for download here on BGG, for the one that comes with the 2nd edition is nearly incomprehensible.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the Inuit language, &quot;tukilik&quot; is used to define an object that carries a message, and the northern landscapes are densely populated with such objects. The most well known of these are the inukshuk, that is, structures of rough stones traditionally used by Inuit people as a landmark or commemorative sign, with the stones often being stacked in the form of a human figure.<br/><br/>During each turn in Tuki, you attempt to construct an inukshuk based on the die face rolled using your stones and blocks of snow. Players have only a limited number of pieces with which to construct the inukshuk, so you'll need to be creative and use the three-dimensional pieces in multiple ways, such as to counterbalance other pieces or even build on top of existing pieces. A solution always exists &mdash; you just need to discover it!<br/><br/>You can choose from two levels of difficulty when playing Tuki to level the playing ground between newcomers and experts. Be swift, yet precise, and transform your stones into messengers of the north...<br/><br/>",

When you arrive on a planet, you decide which cards you want to take and which to leave behind. Knowledge is the most powerful resource in the game, and being able to predict the cards your opponents possess at any given time is a powerful advantage as you build up a handful of weapons, tactical gear, vaults and traps, as well as cards that counter your opponents' cards. The best players will keep their hand fluid, constantly changing tactics while they search from world to world for the Ovoid or find a safe place to stash it.<br/><br/>Balance your hand of cards, spend your turn actions wisely, and cleverly use your special alien powers to stay one step ahead of your opponents.

        "description": "Description from the publisher:<br/><br/>Step into the shoes of a hero that has been bashed and tortured by one or more of the four gangs in the game. You win by building up your hero, scouting gang dens to find the baddies who wronged you, then taking bloody revenge through action-packed fight sequences made up of dice based puzzles.<br/><br/>Vengeance alternates between montage turns and fight turns.  In montage turns, players heal and upgrade their heroes through new abilities and items. They also go out scouting gang dens to find the bosses who wronged them and take revenge on them in the fight turn.<br/><br/>The fight turn is the heart of the game. Players pick one of the scouted gang dens containing a boss who has wronged them and burst into the gang den to exact bloody revenge. Players gain VPs for killing the boss, clearing the den from all the minions or, for maximum points, both. Players have three turns to do this and get out of the den in one piece.<br/><br/>Fights are basically dice-based puzzles. In each round of the fight, players roll a set of dice and decide the order in which they play the rolled results. Upgrade skills and items allow players to swap die-results for others or string together a number of results to perform enemy-slapping combos. Upgrades thus work towards mitigating the luck of the die-roll, giving players more control over their Fight actions.<br/><br/>Players score points by killing bosses who wronged them, i.e., matching the figure on their vengeance card with one of the face down Boss cards attached to each den and/or by clearing all minions of a gang which matches the color of a vengeance card they have in play.<br/><br/>At the end of the game players also score bonus victory points through three mission cards in play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A board game for 2-5 players. Each player controls a group of Rangers, who are working on nature and industry projects in Australia during the 1920s. The game board shows 6 states, which are divided into 24 land or water regions. Every region contains a face down industrial counter and a face up nature counter. On the borders, you find bases (camps or ships), where the players place their Ranger pieces to score points. At the beginning, every player receives a number of Rangers, which he keeps on his own player board, a plane, and two cards. The back of a card shows how many Rangers you can place in a base and how many dollars you receive. The front of a card shows the region where this base should border on.<br/><br/>The active player must perform two actions from the following three possibilities:<br/>1) A player may fly his plane to a region and turn up an industry counter (if available). <br/>2) A player may play a card to collect money and/or place Rangers in one base. Should this card have the same color as the region where his plane is, placement is free. Otherwise, a fee of $3 is collected from the player.<br/>3) A player may remove up to four Rangers from the game board back to his or her supply. <br/>Note: A special move is allowed to move any Ranger on the board for a cost of $4.<br/><br/>You score points by completing nature or industrial projects. Nature projects are completed as soon as the last free base in this region contains at least 1 Ranger. The player who completes the project receives 3 bonus points. Every player with Rangers in a base in this region receives 1 point for every Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Industrial projects are completed as soon as the industry counter is turned over and the surrounding bases contain the required number of Rangers. These projects also provide 3 bonus points and 1 point per Ranger (2 points for Rangers on a ship base). Points are registered on a scoring track. At the end of the game, each dollar is an extra victory point.<br/><br/>The game ends when all card piles are exhausted and at least one player has played his last card. The players add their remaining dollars to their scores. The player with the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>Note: the English rules for the basic game may have an errata. It says draw 9 cards to make stacks, when the non-English rules say draw 8 cards, and the Advanced English rules say draw 9 instead of 8 cards.<br/><br/>Advanced rules<br/><br/>A windmill is introduced. When an industry counter with a windmill symbol is turned over, the windmill moves to another region and will add 1 point to its value. Whenever a region is scored, the nature or industry counter is placed on a windmill track. When the windmill track is filled, a windmill scoring round takes place. To score at the windmill, players need to place Rangers on a special Ranger track (instead of placing them in a base, as they normally would do). The player with the most Rangers on the Ranger track receives the value of the windmill in victory points. The second place receives half, the third place receives half of the second place. After the windmill scoring round, the counters on the windmill are removed and the players have to take half of their Rangers on the Ranger track back. Several windmill scoring rounds are possible. At the end of the game, an extra windmill scoring round takes place.<br/><br/>",

After the initial hand of eight is dealt, players select one card value to collect, which is placed face-up in front of each player.  A fairly standard trick-taking game takes place with the remaining cards, with players following suit if they can.  If you cannot, the card you play can be trump, if you desire.  If two cards of the same suit/value appear, the second can be declared as either high or low.  When a player wins a trick, the cards of the same value they are collecting are placed in his 'good' pile, with each worth one point.  All the rest are put in the 'bad' pile, with each worth minus one point.  However at the end of each hand, you can convert one value of cards from your 'bad' pile onto the 'good' pile.  Of course, if you had enough of them, you'll be collecting that value for the next hand...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Salerno &lsquo;43: The Allied Invasion of Italy, September 1943 is a regiment/brigade-level game on the Allied invasion of mainland Italy in September 1943. Two British and two American divisions land in the Bay of Salerno defended by the full strength 16th Panzer Division, which is soon reinforced by five other German mechanized divisions. For 8 days the survival of the beachhead is in doubt, and emergency measures are taken to reinforce the beachhead with the 82nd Airborne Division. With their counter-attack stopped and the British Eighth Army approaching from the south, the Germans withdraw their left flank to avoid being trapped. However, their right flank stubbornly holds back the British from pushing north to Naples.<br/><br/>Salerno &rsquo;43 uses the exact same map, unit, and time scales as Normandy &rsquo;44, providing an excellent way to compare these two invasions. Salerno &rsquo;43 uses a modified Normandy '44 game system. With a smaller size, the game is easier to learn and play than its predecessor.<br/><br/>Salerno &rsquo;43 includes two scenarios: an 8-turn Invasion Scenario and a 24-turn Campaign Game.

        "description": "Time's Up! Academy is a charades-based party game for teams of two or more players (and is best with teams of two). Before the game begins, each player looks at several cards featuring old TV series, music and movies and chooses some of them. Each player's cards and shuffled to form a deck, and this deck is used for each of the game's three rounds.<br/><br/>In each round, team members take turns trying to get their teammates to guess as many names and titles as possible in 30 seconds. In round 1, almost any kind of clue is allowed, and the cluegiver cannot pass on a card. In round 2, no more than one word can be used in each clue (but unlimited sounds and gestures are permitted); the cluegiver can pass on any card he likes, and the teammates can give only a single answer. In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess. Give good physical clues in round 1, and they'll pay dividends down the road when you need to keep your mouth shut and gesture like a maniac before time's up!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You lead the good life at the top of your tower, contemplating your peaceful kingdom and chatting with your charming neighbors. Life is absolute happiness. Well, it was...<br/><br/>Terrible skeletons have arisen with a creepy clatter from their graves across the realms' ancient cemeteries. Those scouts that return report endless streams of bony hordes marching toward each kingdom, ravaging the lands as they come. Faced with this sudden threat, even your once friendly neighbors seem to have turned against you as they withdraw to their keeps to defend their own frightened kingdoms, focusing on their own villages and tower.<br/><br/>Your kingdom is at siege by the living dead. You raise troops, build walls, lay traps, prepare magical spells and even wake your pet dragon. Hopefully they can be slowed, or if you're devilishly crafty, they can be turned toward those traitorous adjoining kingdoms. In this battle, your best asset is your brave and proud hero, who stands ready to slay those piles of walking bones. Alas, he can't fight everywhere, so if things get truly desperate, you could offer them your treasure to get some relief.<br/><br/>The ivory invaders want somewhere to call their own to live out their death in peace, and they have their eye sockets on you! Will you hold out, or will your home become the retirement village of the damned...?<br/><br/>Bad Bones is a game in which you must survive an invasion of ever more numerous and dangerous skeletons. The invasion cannot be defeated, so you must outlast your opponents to win the day. At your disposal are a range of weapons that defeat, slow, or even deflect the skeletons towards the other players. The game ends when one player's tower or village is wiped out.<br/><br/>A game turn takes place in four phases:<br/><br/>1] Hero Movement and Combat: Move your hero and eliminate the skeletons from the destination square.<br/>2) Trap Placement: Place or remove traps on your personal board.<br/>3) Skeletons Move: Move the skeletons forward, damaging your tower or your village if they move far enough.<br/>4) Skeletons Spawn: Place new skeletons among the streams and on the edges of the player boards.<br/><br/>Each phase happens simultaneously for all players on their own player board, which means a game with up to six players can take only thirty minutes. Multiple copies of the game can be combined to play with as many players as you have space for, and the game can also be played solo. The rules are simple to explain and understand, with several strategic variations for experts.<br/><br/>The basic game is competitive - the surviving player with the most points wins. The advanced rules include a cooperative mode where all the players must survive, in which case they all win.<br/><br/>",

The railroad is being built, and to you and the other gangs in the badlands of South Dakota, this means one thing: cold, hard cash. As a cowboy on the wrong side of the law you know just how to take control of this shanty-town: threaten, fight, and kill off your rivals.<br/><br/>Deadwood is a wild-and-wooly board game with a quick and deadly twist on classic worker placement games. Your gang consists of three different classes of cowboys with different strengths: greenhorns, gunslingers, and trail bosses. Cowboys ride into town to gain control of (annex) buildings and fight other gangs' cowboys in shootouts.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the town of Deadwood consists of the Town Hall, the Church, the Sheriff's Office, the Saloon, and four other randomly drawn buildings. Additional buildings are constructed whenever a cowboy annexes the Town Hall. Each building has at least one unique ability that is used immediately, with some buildings offering more long-term advantages.<br/><br/>A cowboy accesses these advantages by controlling the building. To gain control a player simply places one of his gang on a building tile, &quot;annexing&quot; it. Other gang leaders can try to gain control of your buildings through shootouts. The player that instigates the shootout receives a Wanted Poster token; the more cowboys you try to kill off, the more Wanted Poster tokens you collect, and the higher the fine you must pay at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Deadwood can end one of three ways: the Train Station is placed on the board once the railroad is built and completed, there are no more Wanted Poster tokens in the Crime Pool, or any player has no more cowboys alive. The player with the most cash at the end of the game is the winner!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Storms of Steel! makes you a witness to the greatest tank battle in history! After their stinging defeat at Stalingrad, the Germans mass their best forces for an all-out attack against the growing Soviet bulge at Kursk. The Soviets' network of master spies has caught wind of the German plans, and they are prepared to trap and decimate the best panzer forces the Germans can muster.  Storms of Steel covers one of the largest tank battles in history. German Panzer and Anti-Tank hardware had caught up with the Soviets, allowing the Germans to destroy most Soviet tanks from great distances. But the Soviets countered this advantage with mass production of tanks, which were thrown at the Germans in an attempt to overwhelm them.<br/><br/>Storms of Steel! is the second stand-alone title in the best selling Conflict of Heroes series. Each game in the series uses the same core rules system, so it's easy to advance from one game to the next! Conflict of Heroes is a tactical war game of platoon-sized engagements, with each counter representing a squad of infantry, a crewed gun, or a vehicle. The engagements are presented as firefights with different objectives. During a firefight, players use their army's units to fight for these objectives, which are worth victory points (VPs). The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>The rules for Storms of Steel are the same as for Awakening the Bear, but the two games play very differently. In Awakening the Bear, the Germans had to flank and get close to Soviet tanks if they stood any chance of penetrating the heavy T-34 tank armor. But by 1943, at the battle of Kursk, most Soviet tank armor could be penetrated by the Germans at great distances. So the tables are turned and players must employ very different tactics.<br/><br/>All New for the 3rd Edition:<br/>&bull;Featuring the latest 3rd Edition Conflict of Heroes Rules!<br/>&bull;Updated the maps and overlay artwork to be highly detailed and more beautiful than the original!<br/>&bull;All new counters in addition to new versions of the previous counters!<br/>&bull;New box format, with updated tray inserts designed by Game Trayz!<br/><br/>Please note:  There was never a second edition released.  This release is called Third Edition since it uses same rule-set as Awakening the Bear Third Edition.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1911, Roald Amundsen and four companions were the first human beings to stand at the South Pole. Using skis and dog sleds, they beat Robert Falcon Scott's British expedition by just a few weeks. Scott and his men reached the South Pole only to find Amundsen's Norwegian flag planted in the frozen ground. They died on their return journey not far from their base camp.<br/><br/>1911 Amundsen vs Scott is an asymmetric game for two players, with both of them trying to be the first to reach the South Pole. Each player takes a different route to the South Pole, with these routes consisting of a path of colored dots.<br/><br/>The game is composed by a deck of cards for both players with a row of 3 visible cards. On each turn a player can:<br/><br/><br/>     Collect cards that are face up on the board, taking one card for free, or taking 2-3 cards by first discarding 1-2 cards from your hand.<br/>     Play cards from his hand to advance toward the South Pole, play cards so that the opponent loses his way, or play cards to activate special effects.<br/><br/><br/>The first player to reach the South Pole wins. If the deck runs out for the second time, both players are lost in Antarctica and lose the game.<br/><br/>This game includes 4 expansions inside:<br/>- &quot;Patrons&quot; (8 new cards). 4 British patrons and 4 Norwegian patrons with a special effect each.<br/>- &quot;1912 The Way Back&quot; (second board + 10 new cards). The explorers can play the return to the ships with new rules.<br/>- &quot;Damned Weather!&quot; (5 new cards + 1 die). A small expansion to represent the influence of weather and add a little bit of gambling to the game.<br/>- &quot;Food Depots&quot; (4 white cubes). Only in the second edition!. The explorers made previous short trips to create food depots that they could pick up in the final trip.<br/><br/>",

They seem to be friendly&hellip;. but also really hungry! You must feed them whatever you can find. They will eat anything, but what attracts them the most is the color of objects!<br/><br/>Yummy Yummy Monster Tummy is a co-operative card game of color matching for 2-4 players. Your goal is to complete each level by feeding all of the Creatures foods they like.<br/><br/>Each level consists of several Creatures that you must feed. Once a Creature opens its mouth, it&rsquo;s ready for you to feed it! In any order, each player chooses one Item card from their hand to feed to the Creature by scanning the card&rsquo;s QR code, which is located on the back of the card. When feeding a Monster, you must feed it Item cards that combine and mix into a color that is similar to the Monster&rsquo;s fur color. If you feed a Monster a mix of Items that do not result in a mixed color that is similar to their fur color, all players lose the game and must start the level over again.<br/><br/>You can play Yummy Yummy Monster Tummy in either Story Mode or Party Mode. In Story Mode, there are 12 levels waiting for you. You will follow the story and unlock new Locations and Items by completing levels. On higher levels, you will also meet new Creatures. Some of them have exciting special abilities that provide additional fun challenges!<br/><br/>In Party Mode, you can play a single game session using all of the Items you have unlocked so far. This allows you to experience the game without worrying about the story.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the late 18th century, the Industrial Revolution starts. The first factories were founded by businessmen like Richard Arkwright, who ran the first factory for spinning wool with machines like the &quot;Spinning Jenny&quot; and the water frame.<br/><br/>In &quot;Arkwright: The Card Game&quot;, you run a business and will employ workers in your different factories to produce and sell goods. The more workers, the more goods that can be sold &mdash; but be prepared for crises and some stiff competition.<br/><br/>The game is played over three decades (1770/1780/1790), split up into four rounds per decade. On your turn, you play new cards from your hand to open factories and upgrade existing ones, select improvements, improve factory quality, build machines, and employ new workers. You can also pay money to improve your shareholdings, and take out loans if you require more money for production costs. After the actions phase, you can improve your abilities by advancing your development markers on your player board, or take one of the available development cards.<br/><br/>Then, the production phase starts, where every player who owns a factory of the current good produces those goods. The market fluctuates with the general demand, so the demand may be lower than the value of your current good, lowering your profit. Workers must be paid, and machines need regular maintenance, so you can possibly lose money instead of turning a profit. Selling enough of one good improves your share value, and there are bonuses for having the highest appeal. Lastly, if you can&rsquo;t sell your goods to the home market, you can ship them overseas or store them for future rounds.<br/><br/>After the final round of the last decade, the game ends. Players then sell all goods left in their storehouses, reduce the number of shares they hold by the number of loans they took, and reduce their share value based on their personal shipping track. Each player then multiplies the number of their shares by their share value to determine their end score. The player with the highest end score wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They then launched a clarion call to encourage all homeless adventurers to come live in this new ideal village.<br/><br/>From all corners of the country, volunteers flocked to live in brand new houses, farms and shops. Some even camped on the village square, waiting for houses to become available. Thus, the school is once again filled with the laughter of children and the tavern is filled with playful echoes of conversations, punctuated by the clink of filled glasses. However, there remain claims that werewolves exist among the new community!<br/><br/>Welcome to the Village!

However, in Village, players will also assume a trade/profession.<br/><br/>Note that The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow: Village is both a standalone game and an expansion for the original game, although the card sizes in Village differ from those in the original game.<br/><br/>",

You can possibly ditch these points later, but you'll need the perfect number roll or triple llama luck.<br/><br/>In more detail, the game lasts a number of rounds, and at the start of each round you lay out the seven &quot;black-backed&quot; cards that show a llama and the numbers 1-6 in a &quot;llama row&quot;. You're dealt six cards from the deck &mdash; which consists of llama cards and cards numbered 1-6 &mdash; and you lay those cards in front of you. On a turn, you roll the three dice or quit the round; if you roll the dice, then:<br/><br/><br/>    If one or more of the dice match the cards in front of you, you can discard one card for each matching die.<br/>    If you roll three llamas, you can discard one point token that you've collected.<br/>    If none of the dice match cards in your row, then you must take one of the llama row cards that does match and add it to your display.<br/>    If none of the dice match either cards in your row or cards in the llama row, then you must take all remaining cards in the llama row, ending the round.<br/><br/><br/>If you quit the round, you turn your remaining cards face down and skip any subsequent turns. The round ends when the llama row is empty, when someone discards their final card, or when all players have quit. (When all but one player have quit, the final player can keep taking turns as long as they like, but if none of the dice match cards in their row, then they automatically bust and take all cards in the llama row.) You then look at the cards remaining in front of you and collect points: 10 points if you have one or more llama cards, and points equal to the card value, with each number card counting only once. If you discarded all of your cards, you can discard a previously collected point token. (Tokens are worth either 1 or 10 points, and you can always swap ten 1s for a 10 token.)<br/><br/>You play multiple rounds until one player has collected 40 or more points, at which time the player with the fewest points wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Malifaux is a character-driven 32mm tabletop miniatures game. Players collect, build, and paint models representing the denizens of Malifaux, pitting these models against one another in groups called Crews for control of the precious resource known as Soulstones.<br/><br/>A Crew can contain several different types of models depending on how a player constructs it. Masters can manipulate the course of events in the world around them, changing their own Fates through their control or theft of Soulstones. A variety of fantastic and frightening beings, collectively known as Minions, serve the Master as fodder in his or her machinations. In addition, Henchmen can lead specialized Crews in their Master's absence, or serve their Master directly as a member of a Crew. Masters and Henchmen are also supported by Totems, extensions of their magical abilities which increase their spellcasting range and provide additional aid in an Encounter. Lastly, each Master can transform itself into a powerful Avatar, representing a specific aspect of their personality.<br/><br/>How well a Crew carries out its leader's Strategy and Schemes determines whether or not it will emerge victorious in an Encounter with an enemy Crew. Strategies represent the Crew's main path to victory, while Schemes are simpler alternate routes to achieve the leader's goals.<br/><br/>Malifaux players use decks of cards called Fate Decks to resolve game events such as attacking and spell-casting. Players can manipulate the cards they play to alter the Duel's outcome. It takes a shrewd leader to effectively utilize a Crew's resources, ensuring he or she always has ready the cards needed to Cheat Fate.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A New Train Adventure Begins!<br/><br/>The Ticket to Ride Card Game delivers all of the excitement, fun, and nail-biting tension of the original Ticket to Ride board game, but with several unique game-play twists in a new stand-alone, card game format.<br/><br/>Players collect sets of illustrated Train cards, which are then used to complete Destination Tickets - routes between two cities depicted on each ticket. But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of &quot;train robbing,&quot; where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards.<br/><br/>Contains 96 illustrated train car cards, 46 destination tickets, 6 big city prize cards, and a rulebook.<br/><br/>Part of the Ticket to Ride series.<br/><br/>To begin the game, each player is dealt train car cards and destination ticket cards.  All these cards are kept secret from the other players until played or scored.  Each player may keep all his ticket cards, just one or any number in between.  A player's turn has two parts: first the player moves face up train car cards from his Railyard to his face down, On-the-Track stack; second the player may perform one of the following actions: 1) draw more train car cards, 2) place train car cards in his Railyard, or 3) draw destination tickets.  Like the original Ticket to Ride board game, when a player chooses to draw train car cards, he may choose from the five face up cards or draw from the top of the face down deck.  When placing cards in the Railyard, a player may place two or more cards of the same color including locomotives which are wild, or three cards, each of a different color.  Also when placing cards in the Railyard, a player may not play cards of the same color as those currently present in his Railyard nor of the same color as those present in any opponent's Railyard unless he plays more of that color than are present in the opponent's Railyard.  If the player plays more, then the opponent must discard his cards of that color.  This is called &quot;Train robbing.&quot;  When drawing destination tickets, a player draws four and may keep any number of them including none.<br/><br/>When the train car card deck is exhausted in a two or three player game, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  In a four player game, completed tickets are scored and discarded train car cards are reshuffled into a new draw deck.  When that deck is exhausted, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  At the end of the game all tickets not previously scored are scored.  The point values of completed tickets are added to a players score while those of tickets not completed are subtracted.  To complete tickets, players match train car cards in their On-the-Track stack by color and quantity with their tickets.  Each big city bonus is awarded to the player with the most completed tickets having that city.  These bonus points are added to the player's score.  The player scoring the most total points wins.<br/><br/>",

Rooted soundly in Mark Herman's award-winning We The People system, The Napoleonic Wars provides refinements that allow two-to-five players to play an exciting game requiring two to ten hours. The majority of your games will easily end in a single evening, thanks to sudden death victory conditions providing variable game lengths that eliminate the &quot;end of the world&quot; phenomenon that plague many games. Often, you'll set 'em up and knock 'em down twice a night, and once in a great while your Campaign game will require two nights of play for the terrific panoramic history to unfold before your eyes.<br/><br/>Like similar card-driven games, The Napoleonic Wars provides strategy cards that are played as events or to activate leaders, armies or fleets (by play of command points) to move on the map. Players must constantly weight the value of an event or reaction card against the need for its command points. Command points themselves can be played for a wide variety of activities, making play unpredictable and fresh with each sitting. Uncontrolled powers are governed by a diplomatic track which is also affected by play of command points and events.<br/><br/>Expanded by:<br/><br/>     Napoleonic Wars: Super Deluxe Map<br/><br/><br/>Revised by:   <br/><br/>     The Napoleonic Wars 2008 Update Kit (upgrade to 2nd edition)<br/><br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>     Wellington<br/>     The Napoleonic Wars (Second Edition) (aka 2008 reprint Edition)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the teachings of the Catholic Church, an indulgence may be granted to relieve sins. In some cases, this might be by doing good works or engaging in meaningful prayer, but in the darkest of times, indulgences were sold to anyone willing to make a significant &quot;contribution&quot;. As the rising families of the Italian Renaissance conspired and plotted to seize control, the indulgence offered a clear conscience for many a questionable deed committed in the name of power.<br/><br/>Indulgence is a trick-taking game for 3-4 players. On their turn, players choose an edict that gives the rule for the hand. The other players then decide if they want to violate the edict by doing the opposite of what it commands. So &quot;Don&rsquo;t take any Medicis&quot; suddenly becomes &quot;I must take all the Medicis&quot;. Committing a sin can be challenging, but a player attempting it gets the benefit of the indulgence, a token that turns one of their cards into a winning hand. Can you trick your opponents into committing sins without the indulgence? Can you avoid sinning yourself? Whoever can pull that off will end up with a pile of gems and the title of victor.<br/><br/>Indulgence is a restoration of Dragonmaster, originally published by Milton Bradley in 1981 and designed by Jerry D'Arcey. It was itself a reimagining of D'Arcey's prior game, Coup d'Etat, and its classic progenitor Barbu. Dragonmaster enjoyed lavish production, with oversized cards, art by the incomparable Bob Pepper, and some nifty interlocking gems for keeping score. In addition to the retheming, the restoration evens out the game play. The original game suffered from a runaway leader problem in which an early power play with the dragon card all but assured one player's elimination from contention and gave the other a big leg up. The indulgence token replaces the dragon card to make it more accessible, less powerful, and easier to understand. It also increases the number of contracts from 5 to 20, and ups the deck to 36 cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Glorantha: The Gods War is a competitive strategy game in which 3 or 4 players (3 to 8 players with the Empires expansion) summon units (minions, heroes, lesser gods and usually one greater god); construct buildings (usually Shrines, Temples, and Ziggurats) and clash in mortal combat. The players seek to build their own strength and destroy their enemies by killing their enemies' units and capturing and destroying their enemies' buildings, to achieve Heroquests and thus earn gifts, and to earn runes with unique effects. Each empire has its own, and different, unique ability, weakness, greater god ability, units, Heroquests and gifts. For example, the Darkness empire features trolls, the Mistress (Cragspider), shades, and the Hellmother (Kyger Litor), while the Sky empire has archers, the Emperor, phoenixes, and the Sun God (Yelm). These are not just the same units with different names, but also have different abilities, as do their buildings. Chaos has both different buildings, three greater gods (the Unholy Trio) and a different agenda to the other empires. The game has a world-shattering &quot;mythic&quot; feel to it rather than a &ldquo;fantasy adventure&rdquo; sensation.<br/><br/>Glorantha: The Gods War is based on the vigorous mythic realm of Glorantha, which has been the basis for multiple tabletop board, roleplaying, and even digital games, as well as numerous works of fiction. Its depth and scope has been recognized by numerous aficionados of fantasy and gaming, and now it is brought to you in all its astounding power.<br/><br/>In each round, in the Action Phase players spend the power they have earned from various sources, most importantly how many different types of buildings they have and the Heroquests they have achieved. They then spend power to build more buildings, summon and move units, do battle with enemy empires, and use powerful empire-specific abilities including from their earned gifts. The Council Phase may include an attempt to close the Chaos Rift that threatens the existence of the world and/or the Great Compromise in which an empire may sacrifice power for the greater good and to distribute victory points.<br/><br/>Victory is determined by obtaining victory points from various sources, most importantly the number of buildings controlled each round, paired Heroquests achieved and the Great Compromise, and from runes.<br/><br/>",

Findorff has three &ldquo;F&rdquo;s and is named after J&uuml;rgen Christian Findorff (1720-1792), who was responsible for draining and surveying the bog in the north of Bremen, for extracting the peat, and for populating the bog with residents.<br/><br/>In Findorff, the game, you build up the district of Findorff in the period from 1803 to 1916. Historically, six major railway stations stood in Findorff during this period to connect to Hannover, Hamburg, Oldenburg, and Bremerhaven. While they were all later replaced by a single big main train station, you raise another three new rail stations at one of the two main roadbeds. Besides using boats on the peat canal, this small railway  helped to transport even more peat from the bog in the north of Bremen to Findorff. During the first half of the 19th Century, peat was the most important commodity for heating the houses and for supplying energy to the industry. In the late 19th century (and in the game), peat lost its importance once when replaced by the energy-rich coal.<br/><br/>Findorff offers an economic engine builder with a resource market for peat known from Power Grid and an innovative resource management required when building rail tracks and houses in Findorff. Your focus is on raising the right combination of the 25 historical structures from the period of 1803-1916. Do you raise the Chair Pipes Factory or the Slaughterhouse to gain a lot of thalers, or smaller structures like Schools, the Beer Hall, or the Peat Skipper Shelter to win the game in small steps. You can even profit from the high mortality rate of this period by running a Cemetery.<br/><br/>Only by adapting your strategy to your structures you honor Mr. Findorff, and win the game when the roadbed to Hamburg is finished.<br/><br/>Findorff offers a challenging solo game as well.<br/><br/>",

But be careful: your opponent may use one of their Mindbugs to take control of it.<br/><br/>Outwit your opponent in a fascinating tactical duel in which having the best cards and playing them at the wrong time can be deadly for yourself.<br/><br/>Mindbug combines the accessibility and fairness of a simple card game with the strategic depth of a complex Strategy Card Game. The result is a skill-based dueling card game that feels utterly different from all the other card games you have played before.<br/><br/>",

At the same time, they'll be using their influence to sway various events that arise. They'll also find themselves having to deal with Booker and Elizabeth, who are running around Columbia creating havoc.<br/><br/>The game has players combating one another, stealing objectives from under each other's noses, assassinating leaders, destroying strongholds, bidding against each other for control of unfolding events, and more. The first faction to 10 victory points wins. Because there are only two factions, the game can be played by two players in a head-to-head format, or by four players paired off in two teams.<br/><br/>",

Each character has unique skills and multiple ways of overcoming obstacles, but you decide what to do during the game: Do you fight your way to victory, call on your charm, or try your hand at diplomacy? You can bring enemies around to your point of view with a sword as Geralt - or bribe them with gold and threaten to call on powerful friends as Dandelion. If a situation calls for strength in numbers, Yarpen has his own fellowship of dwarves to command, and Triss can rely on her expert skill with magic to save the day.<br/><br/>Each character has its own deck of Development Cards, so each time you play you can discover something new by trying out varied characters and experimenting with different builds. For example, when playing as Geralt of Rivia, the main hero of the Witcher franchise, you can develop your character either by specializing in brewing and utilizing combat Elixirs, or else by growing your ability to cast powerful Witcher Signs.<br/><br/>A variety of quests invite players to hunt monsters, earn gold and interact with the characters they meet in a web of alliances and treachery. Decide whether you&rsquo;ll help the other players or look after your own interests first, and keep an eye on the progress of your friends while you carefully work your way towards victory.<br/><br/>",

In this narrative puzzle adventure, an intimate coming-of-age story is told through an object that serves as a tarot deck, a puzzle game, and a work of art. You will need to manipulate cards, find hidden messages, and solve logic and word problems in order to uncover the deck&rsquo;s secrets.<br/><br/>The tarot deck contains 78 cards--56 Minor Arcana and 22 Major Arcana, the latter of which each represent a puzzle. Puzzles are solved using sets of  Minor Arcana cards and clues from the story booklet and result in solution keywords that lead players to discover new pieces of the narrative. Some story passages grant items which can be later used to unlock extra scenes, and some puzzles have multiple answers, allowing players to unlock more of the story if they find all the solutions.<br/><br/>Packed with gorgeous illustrations, resonant storytelling, and unique puzzles, The Light in the Mist can be played solo or cooperatively in a small group. It&rsquo;s non-linear structure and varied puzzle difficulty will engage players of all experience levels with over five hours of gameplay. Do you have what it takes to overcome the challenges thrown your way without getting lost in the mist?<br/><br/>",

Whoever has the majority of cubes in that area owns it &mdash; except that ties for majority are disregarded, so in a spread of 3/3/1 cubes, the player with only one cube owns that area!<br/><br/>Players have a limited amount of money with which to bid. They can take one loan each turn, but the first loan gives them only $9 more, while the second loan gives them $8 and the third $7. At the end of the game, the player must repay $10 for each loan taken, with that money coming from the value of the property they now own.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, players tally the value of what they own (with some properties being doubled in value if the player owns that region's doubler as well as areas within that region), then repay all loans.

The board itself is actually a fairly abstract hexagonal system, with track tiles placed on top of the hexes.  Players buy and sell stock in various share companies, whose actions are controlled by the majority stockholder.  The stock manipulation aspect of the game is not as brutal as in 1830.  Plus each 18xx title adds new and different elements to the game.<br/><br/>This game features minor rail companies, layered stock offerings, and the formation of the Prussian railroad from the minor companies.

This makes it easy to learn the contents of your deck: numbered cards are normal moves, face cards are special moves, and aces are super moves.<br/><br/>Yomi is a competitive card game specifically designed and balanced to hold up to tournament play with many years of playtesting and tournaments behind it. It tests the skills of valuation and Yomi. Valuation refers to your ability to judge the relative value of moves (or cards) as they change over the course of the game. Yomi, the game's title, refers to your ability to &quot;read&quot; the patterns that your opponent unconsciously falls into. It's designed for high level play to be as interesting as possible and as balanced as possible.<br/><br/>Game Modes<br/><br/>     1v1, the main mode<br/>     2v2 Team Battle, inspired by video games such as Marvel vs Capcom<br/>     A solo mode to learn basic proficiency against an automated opponent<br/>     A 3v3 mode (can be played as 1v1 with multiple characters) inspired by video games such as King of Fighters<br/><br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>     Each player shuffles their deck and draws an opening hand of seven cards.<br/>     Turns are simultaneous and players draw one card per turn.<br/>     Each player plays a combat card face down, then reveals the cards simultaneously.<br/>     Resolve combat. Blocking an attack lets you draw a card; hitting with an attack or throw allows you to combo more cards from your hand; dodging an attack lets you hit back with a single move.<br/>     Bluff phase. After it's resolved who won combat, but before any combos are played, the player who might get hit by a combo can play a facedown Joker or bluff card. After the attacker finishes their combo, reveal that facedown card. If it's a Joker, the combo does no damage. If it's a non-Joker card, the combo does full damage as usual.<br/>     Power up: Players can discard pairs, 3-of-a-kinds, or 4-of-a-kinds to search their decks for Aces (super moves). Also, if they performed any chain combos (straights of sequential normal attacks, such as a 2,3,4,5) that turn, they can also search for Aces.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when one player is reduced to 0 life, or when one player draws the last card of their deck. In that case, time is out and the player with the highest life wins.<br/><br/>Note: This item contains:<br/>Yomi Starter Set: Grave versus Jaina<br/>Yomi Starter Set: Midori versus Setsuki<br/><br/>",

The promised land is represented by Gaia, which is home to the magnificent human civilization of Atlantis. But beware, other Houses (factions) of your civilization also have the same goal and only one will be able to dominate Gaia!<br/><br/>Anunnaki: Dawn of the Gods is a 4x eurogame by Simone Luciani and Danilo Sabia, set in an ancient dystopian past, where mythology and science-fiction come together. Each player represents a different House whose rulers are viewed by terrestrial population as gods. Players build bases, recruit troops, embody gods, explore the territory, develop their own technology, sign trade contracts, defeat local dominions and other players' armies, trying to conquer Atlantis, which owns huge treasures.<br/><br/>Different actions will provide a certain number of immediate Victory Points. Moreover, random setup goals will provide you with sizable Victory Point rewards at the end of the game, based on specific conditions. In the end, the player with the most VPs will be the winner.<br/><br/>In addition to having a strong dose of controllability (the luck factor is minimal), the game features an innovative starred action-selection-system that confronts players with interesting choices: players can reincarnate their gods by performing their actions in a precise sequence, on pre-established paths of their starred player board, or they can give up some deities, jumping freely from one action to another of their board, to choose from time to time the situationally best actions.<br/><br/>Cover Art by Paolo Vicenzi &amp; Jara Zambrano<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

What unfolds is a branching, labyrinthine dungeon of dangerous enemies, wandering monsters, challenging puzzles, and valuable treasure.<br/><br/>Bardsung is a game of choosing your path as you seek to inspire the bard&rsquo;s songs and live your legend. From your physical passage through the dungeon to your journey of building your character into a fabled hero, your choices define your experience.<br/><br/>Because dungeons are procedurally generated (like those in a roguelike video game), no two playthroughs will be the same. Lay tiles to build the dungeon as you go, choosing your direction from the options at hand to seek loot and avoid threats.<br/><br/>Encounter different enemies and challenges each time through Event, Battle, and Challenge decks that spawn new foes and throw curveballs in the form of poisoned weapons, traps, reinforcements, non-player characters, and more.<br/><br/>Round length, turns, and enemy activations are governed by a dynamic marching order that will keep you on your toes, encouraging you to adopt strategies that control the ebb and flow of initiative.<br/><br/>As you continue your campaign, level up your hero to upgrade their stats, access powerful new abilities, and enhance existing skills. You have the freedom to either follow your hero&rsquo;s designated path, or to create your own bespoke hero with a unique set of traits and arsenal of attack combos.<br/><br/>Enter intelligent and dangerous combat where positioning and teamwork are vital for maximizing your attacks and working with your allies. Your abilities can&rsquo;t be used over and over, so choose your moment wisely. And beware, for the same enemy will behave differently from one encounter to the next. Just like your hero, enemies can level up, evolve their attacks, and can even learn to hold grudges against heroes who defeat them...<br/><br/>Bardsung can be enjoyed as a cooperative game of up to five players, or as an exciting solo player experience. Explore the dungeon in standalone sessions, or as part of a far-reaching narrative campaign that evolves based on your decisions.<br/><br/>An RPG dungeon explorer, Bardsung takes the best elements of traditional roleplaying games and beloved dungeon-crawling classics, and combines them with a dash of contemporary gameplay to create a powerful new experience.<br/><br/>With swift setup and easy-to-grasp mechanics taught by an intuitive tutorial-based rulebook, your descent into the dungeon will be quick.<br/><br/>Inspire the songs. Live your legend. Become Bardsung.<br/><br/>",

While Cthulhu Gloom can be played on its own or combined with Gloom and its many expansions, it does introduce two new types of cards:<br/><br/>&bull; Story cards can be in play from the start of the game, and the first player to meet a Story card's conditions &ndash; e.g., drawing the attention of The King in Yellow or heeding The Call of Cthulhu &ndash; claims the card and gains its benefits (or drawbacks).<br/><br/>&bull; Transformation cards mutate a character for the remainder of the game, no matter which modifiers might come its way later.

On a turn, a player rolls one die into the arena, which is set inside the bottom of the box. If any two or more dice show the same symbol, that player then claims those dice and their turn ends.

Whoever last holds dice wins!<br/><br/>Impact: Battle of Elements includes a variant in which each of the symbols has a special power, and when you make a match, you get to use the power of that symbol.<br/><br/>",

Your quest is to find the best spots for your seeds to grow across a variety of vibrant, beautiful, and cozy gardens.<br/><br/>In Dandelions, players roll a group of dice, then choose one to move to a beautiful garden. Along the way, you can harness the power of the wind with three special actions &mdash; float, puff, and gust &mdash; to get the most points. The game ends after all the dice are used, and whoever receives the most victory points as combined from two different scoring methods wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Bayonets &amp; Tomahawks&quot; is a 2-player card-driven strategic wargame focusing on the &quot;French &amp; Indian War&quot;, 1755-1760. Its fluid yet rich system ensures fun for players of all levels. One player controls the British and the other controls the French and most Indians. Indian diplomacy, raids, constructions, naval operations, sieges: nothing is left out in order to immerse players in the fascinating military asymmetries of the 18th-Century colonial frontier. <br/>  <br/>A game of Bayonets &amp; Tomahawks can last 1 or more game years depending on the scenario chosen &mdash; up to the full conflict. During each game year, there are 8 action rounds where players move their pieces on land and sea, perform raids, build forts and roads, etc. Battles/sieges usually occur at the end of each action round. A game year also includes 3 logistics rounds: &ldquo;Fleets arrive&rdquo;, &ldquo;Colonials enlist&rdquo; and &ldquo;Winter quarters&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Bayonets &amp; Tomahawks is card-driven. But unlike most card assisted wargames player don't manage a hand of cards. Each player starts the year with one undisclosed reserve Action card picked randomly. At the beginning of each Action round, both players draw a new card. They must then choose one of their 2&nbsp;cards to play for the current round. The other card becomes their reserve for the next round. At each action round, the French player also gets a random Indians action&nbsp;card.<br/><br/>The Action points (AP) on the cards in play determine how many stacks of pieces a player can activate during the current round. In addition the cards trigger events and determine initiative for the next Action round. Movement is point to point. Pieces can also move via sea zones.<br/><br/>Each side has particular assets he must make the most of in order to achieve victory. The British have overwhelming numbers, the French are more adept at wilderness fighting with the help of their numerous Indian allies. To win, a player must control enough enemy key spaces to reach the scenario&rsquo;s Invasion victory points requirement by game end. In one-year scenarios, pieces removed permanently from play yield Invasion VP as well. The French player can also win if he succeeds in enough raids during the current year to reach the scenario&rsquo;s Raid&nbsp;victory points requirement.<br/><br/>By its nature, the game lends itself to solitaire play. In bonus, the rules allow to split the actions of each camp methodically. This way, up to 2 British players (British, Colonial) and 3 French players (French, Canadien, Indian) can relive the historic pains of shared command.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arimaa, pronounced &quot;a-ree-muh,&quot; is a game where stronger animals like elephants and camels freeze, push, and pull the weaker ones from the opposing team around and into traps, while one of the rabbits tries to sneak across the board and harmlessly reach the other side. The first player to get one of their rabbits to the other side wins.<br/><br/>This may sound like a simple kids' game, and while it is easy enough for your kids to learn and enjoy, you will find that it is also a very deep game that can take a lifetime to master. Arimaa is one of the deepest strategy games ever invented in the history of mankind, but designed to look intuitively simple. No two games of Arimaa are ever the same. There is much to learn and discover about this intuitively simple, yet intellectually challenging, game.<br/><br/>Played on an 8x8 grid with four trap squares and 32 animal pieces (16 gold and 16 silver). Each player has an elephant, a camel, 2 horses, 2 dogs, 2 cats, and 8 rabbits. Strength hierarchy: Elephant &gt; Camel &gt; Horse &gt; Dog &gt; Cat &gt; Rabbit. The game begins with an empty board. Gold places the sixteen gold pieces first in any configuration on the first and second ranks. Silver then places the sixteen silver pieces in any configuration on seventh and eighth ranks. Then gold moves its pieces first. A player can move up to four &quot;steps&quot; each turn. All pieces move orthogonally (at right angles).<br/><br/>Arimaa was invented by Omar Syed, an Indian-American computer engineer trained in artificial intelligence. Syed was inspired by Garry Kasparov's defeat at the hands of the chess computer Deep Blue to design a new game that could be played with a standard chess set, would be difficult for computers to play well, but would have rules simple enough for his then four-year-old son Aamir to understand. (Arimaa is Aamir spelled backwards plus an initial &quot;a&quot;). In 2002, Syed published the rules to Arimaa and announced a $10,000 prize, available annually until 2020, for the first computer program (running on standard, off-the-shelf hardware) able to defeat each of three top-ranked human players in a three-game series.<br/><br/>",

Thus, an exciting race starts among the elves to find out who will make the best use of the available transportation. The one who visits the most towns wins.<br/><br/>Elfengold, an expansion for Elfenland, adds gold coins to the game that players use to bid for the Travel Counters and other new items. It also adds Gold Value Tokens to the towns that indicate how much gold players earn for visiting a town. Two magic spells and a new obstacle &mdash; a Sea Monster &mdash; are included as well as two round cards to allow for longer games up to six rounds.<br/><br/>In Elfensea, as in Elfenland, young elves have to pass a special test before they are accepted as grownups. The same rules apply in Elfensea as in Elfenland, except as described in the rules.

Players are placed in command of the opposing superpower fleets. The mighty aircraft carriers and escorting capital ships must be protected from the devastating firepower of modern missiles, torpedoes, and bomb attacks. Attack submarines threaten the enemy task forces and replenishment convoys while searching out their submerged rivals. Limited air assets must be carefully assigned to combat air patrols, long-range strategic missions and attack strikes. 2nd Fleet, with its multitude of options and strategies, is one of today's most realistic recreations of modern naval warfare on the high seas.<br/><br/>Each 8 hour game turn is broken into 3 distinct phases (sub, surface, and air) and each player takes turns choosing which phase they wish to conduct. Ex. if the US player chooses &quot;Air&quot;, they conduct all bombing, shipping strikes, anti-sub, and interception actions for all their aircraft.<br/>Players also use their units to attempt to &quot;detect&quot; enemy forces so that an attack can be made. Ships and aircraft are always detected once a unit moves close enough to them, but players have to roll to try to detect subs.<br/>Optional rules include nuclear weapons and logistics.<br/>About 10 scenarios are included which range from about 60 minutes (for Introductory Scenarios) to 3 to 6 hours (for Intermediate Scenarios) to 20 or more hours (for the Advanced Scenario).<br/><br/>Part of Victory Games Fleet Series.<br/><br/>",

Meanwhile, they also have to defeat other plots in several places (Le Louvre, La Rochelle...).<br/><br/>A turn begins with Milady playing plots/cards, and secretly programming a destination.<br/><br/>Then, each musketeer (D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos, or Aramis) has 3-4 actions to choose amongst: move, draw a card, get equipment, exchange cards/equipment, challenge in one of his four characteristics, fight against one of Richelieu's guards, reinforce La Rochelle... Milady can also reveal herself and send Rochefort to fight the Musketeers.<br/><br/>The game includes rules for an AI-controlled Milady and can therefore be played as a pure co-op.<br/><br/>&quot;One against all, all against one!&quot;<br/><br/>Essen 2010 release.<br/><br/>",

One player controls the German army, and the other player controls the Soviet army. The game uses a simplified version of the Area&ndash;Impulse System, first introduced in Avalon Hill&rsquo;s &ldquo;Storm Over Arnhem&rdquo;. The game is 6 turns long, at the end of which time the winner is determined by comparing the players predetermined controlled victory areas to actual.<br/><br/>The prize at the end of Germany's 1942 summer offensive was Stalingrad. The city, while being a propaganda key due to its name, was also a key industrial city sitting upon both rail and river networks. The German 6th Army hit arrived at the west bank of the Volga by late August and began their assault on the city. &quot;Stalingrad must not be taken by the enemy&quot; ordered Stalin. Now you can command the defense of the city and try to hold versus a talented, but stretched thin, German Army. Or will you find something the Germans didn't and seize both the city and the day?<br/><br/>As has become common with games in the IGS line, playability matched with historical flavor has been achieved to a remarkable degree. In Storm Over Stalingrad, players alternate impulses where they move or fire, but only rarely both. Cards influence play, but do not drive the game. Can you take most of the city of Stalingrad before the Soviet offensive begins?<br/><br/>This game uses a simplified version of the Storm over Arnhem system. While it shares the same game system and theme as Turning Point: Stalingrad, it has a different feel due to it covering a smaller time period, using tactical cards, and simpler rules.<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 2 weeks<br/>Area: 1&quot; = approximately 547 yards / 25mm =  approximately 500 meters<br/>Units: Battalion to Brigade<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>Two 15x21&quot; full color mapsheets<br/>One dual-side printed countersheet (176 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 8-page Storm Over Stalingrad rulebook<br/>One deck of tactical cards (27 German, 27 Russian, 1 proof of purchase)  <br/>Two 6-sided die<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Low<br/>Players: 2 or more<br/>Playing Time: 2-4 hours<br/><br/>",

But beware: as the city grows, everything you build will also open up new opportunities for your competitors. Will you make a fortune? Or will you be caught out when the boom inevitably turns to bust in a game-ending market crash?&rdquo;<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Magnate: The First City is a midweight strategy game for 1-5 players. Each turn players try to grow their property empire by performing different actions, including: buying plots of land, constructing buildings, marketing their developments and selling them completely for their capital value. Once per round, they will also get the chance to attract tenants to any empty buildings they have. If they are successful, they will start collecting rent from their tenants and increase the value of their holdings. At the same time, they will also create new development opportunities for themselves and their opponents.<br/><br/>But in Magnate, as in real life, not all locations are equally appealing to all types of tenant. Magnate&rsquo;s four types of tenant - residential, offices, retail and industry - all want to be linked to other types of tenant in nearby neighbourhoods. And they are all affected differently by what&rsquo;s next door: The airport is an asset for offices, but it&rsquo;s an unattractive place for new residents. By clever tactical and strategic building, players can increase their odds of attracting these tenants and improve their return on investment - without benefiting their opponents too much.<br/><br/>But while the players acquire more and larger properties, the price of land keeps rising higher and higher. Eventually, it becomes completely unsustainable and a game-ending crash that will destroy the value of players&rsquo; properties becomes inevitable. When exactly the crash happens, however, is shaped by the players: How much land they buy and how much property they sell will more make a crash on any specific turn more or less likely. Players must time their actions carefully to avoid substantial losses while maximizing their profits. Only then will they emerge victorious as the city&rsquo;s wealthiest property magnate.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The end goal is simple enough, the player who has the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins! Players acquire Victory Points by employing a variety of maids and &quot;Love&quot; cards that allow for different strategies. You can even employ Private Maids that stick around to use their special powers each per turn! Some give you a bonus, or affect your opponents in a negative way. But beware, your opponents can make your maids sick or give them bad habits, affecting your maids in negative ways and decreasing your Victory Points!<br/><br/>The game art is in the Japanese anime style and uses the theme of maids commonly seen in anime! All of the cards, dividers and manual fit into an easy to transport box so you can easily take the game with you wherever you want.<br/><br/>Tanto Cuore: Expanding the House includes 280 cards, with artwork from 27 artists.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Where there is discord... may we bring harmony.&quot;  -- Margaret Thatcher, quoting a prayer ascribed to St. Francis of Assisi<br/><br/>At 16.28 hours on the afternoon of Saturday, 1 May 1982, an AIM-9L Sidewinder missile fired from the Sea Harrier of Royal Naval Air Squadron Flight Lieutenant Paul Barton struck the Mirage III of Lieutenant Carlos Perona of Fuerza Aerea Argentina, destroying it on impact.  The Falkland/Malvinas War had begun in earnest.<br/><br/>Over the next 45 days, the armed forces of the United Kingdom and Argentina locked in a deadly struggle, as both attempted to assert their right to govern a small, inhospitable South Atlantic island unknown to most of the world and to many of those fighting over her.<br/><br/>    In this solitaire military simulation boardgame, you have the opportunity to recreate those fateful summer days, commanding the British Task Force as it attempts to defend itself from concerted attacks by Argentine air and naval forces, and mount a successful amphibious landing on the disputed islands.  You will have to manage and deploy the Royal Navy&rsquo;s limited Sea Harrier assets, coordinate the defence of the fleet with a wide range of vessels and weapons systems, and plan a landing strategy that enables you to consolidate a bridgehead before Argentine forces can respond.  Modeled closely on historical events, you will confront issues including variable rules of engagement, surveillance and intelligence gathering, submarine warfare, Argentine carrier and surface fleet operations, the Exocet missile threat, third-party operational support and interference, fleet logistics, supply interdiction, and uncooperative weather.  At the same time you will have to walk the tightrope of public opinion, deal with &ldquo;oversight&rdquo; from the politicians back in London, and overcome unforeseen events ranging from the sabotage of supply lines up to orders to take the fight to the mainland.<br/> Will the Falklands remain in British hands, or will the Malvinas return to Argentina?  Their fate is in your hands..<br/><br/>",

Pixel Tactics 3 contains 25 new heroes including:<br/><br/><br/>    Gerard Matranga / Mercenary &ndash; Ignore wave restrictions on attacking!<br/>    Alice Zero / Failsafe &ndash; Who allows you to switch leaders mid-game!<br/>    Arret Draamivaar / Dispatcher &ndash; Recruit up to 14 heroes at once!<br/>    Cherri Seneca / Dreamseer &ndash; Drawing cards is a free action for you!<br/>    Udstad / Golem &ndash; Forces your opponents to flee in terror!<br/><br/><br/>Pixel Tactics 3 is a head-to-head game of tactical combat for two players. Each player has an identical deck of 25 cards, from which they draft a leader. The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.<br/><br/>In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders &ndash; powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.<br/><br/>Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game is best of three or five rounds.<br/><br/>",

The scenarios allow players to recreate various stages of the war or the entire campaign. In each of these scenarios, the player takes on the role of Commander Submarines, US Pacific Fleet (ComSubPac), deploying available submarines from either Pearl Harbor or Brisbane in order to attack the Japanese Navy. Additionally, in the patrol game, using single submarines, players can recreate some of the war's most famous patrols. The amount of flexibility the game allows the player is tremendous, a single submarine patrol can be completed in 10 minutes, the various campaigns can be completed in 10 or more hours depending on which campaign you play and your progress as commander.<br/><br/>Every American submarine that was deployed to the Pacific in World War II has its own oversize easy to handle counter in the game. Each counter has the correct side view illustration in color for that class of submarine. The game map covers the huge expanse of the Pacific Theater of submarine operations from the Aleutians to Australia and from Samoa to the Sea of Japan. The map encapsulates most of the information a player needs to play, with a unique set of easy to use graphic charts. The rules will have the player running his first submarine patrol within 45 minutes of opening the game box.<br/><br/>Special rules include American torpedo improvement, ultra, submarine repair and readiness, wolfpacks, campaign and combat events, war progress, patrol and search, TDC solutions, merchant shipping, Japanese battleship doctrine, two player rules and more.<br/><br/>Can you as a submarine fleet commander best the historical submarine commanders and sink more ships and tonnage than the American commanders or will you wash out and be retired to a desk job?<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>     1 28&quot;x22&quot; map<br/>     5 counter sheets, mounted, die cut and full color printed on both sides:<br/>         3&frac12; sheets of long (1.3&quot;x0.65&quot;) submarine counters<br/>         1&frac12; sheets of large (0.65&quot;x0.65&quot;) counters.<br/>    <br/>     4 8&frac12;&quot;x11&quot; full-color play-aid charts and displays:<br/>         1 single-sided combat display<br/>         1 single-sided submarine tender display<br/>         1 tables and charts display<br/>         1 counter explanation chart/sub comparison chart<br/>    <br/>     1 24-page rules book<br/>     1 24-page scenario book<br/>     1 10-sided die<br/>     1 full color box and lid<br/><br/><br/>",

During the Rolling Thunder (1965-68) and Linebacker (1972) campaigns, Hanoi and the Red River Valley was the focus of American air operations intended to pressure North Vietnam's Communist leadership  into ceasing their attacks on the South. Against large &quot;packages&quot; of US attack and support aircraft, the Vietnamese deployed a formidable array of anti-aircraft artillery (AAA) and Surface to Air Missiles (SAMs). They also had a force of MiG fighter jets.<br/><br/>Covering air operations from 1965 to 1972, Downtown simulates the clashes between American air power and the North Vietnamese air defence system. The United States player controls Air Force and Navy strikes into Route Packs 5 and 6 - the heart of the Vietnamese defences.<br/><br/>Packages include forces of bombers, fighters, recon planes, jamming aircraft and &quot;Iron Hand&quot; aircraft for suppression of enemy air defenses (SEAD). The US player's objective is to destroy ground targets. They can only succeed by integrating all the package elements to complete the mission with minimal loss.<br/><br/>The North Vietnamese player controls concentrations of AAA, Fire Can radar-directed artillery and SAM . They can launch MiG fighters to intercept the bomber streams aimed at 'Downtown' Hanoi. The Vietnamese player must disrupt enemy attacks.<br/><br/>20 scenarios cover historical strike raids from the Rolling Thunder and Linebacker operations.

Mounted game boards, laminated full color ship control cards and gorgeous full color counters highlight this re-imagining of the Star Fleet Universe with 21st century production values.<br/><br/>This was the initial product for Federation Commander, and was the original base set.  There are other base sets and expansions for the Federation Commander Series.<br/><br/>Much effort has gone into streamlining the game - there are 8 impulses rather than 32.  One die roll allocates up to 10 points of damage, rather than 2 dice per damage point that strikes the ship.   Color coded charts and ship cards reduce the mental overhead of remembering what goes where.<br/><br/>Gone is the tax form of energy allocation, replaced by a free flowing dynamic &quot;on the fly&quot; power allocation system.  Maneuver has had countless special cases removed and streamlined.<br/><br/>This is not an introduction to Star Fleet Battles, but a re-imagining of starship combat in the Star Fleet Universe, redesigned from the ground up to appeal to a wider audience and reduce rules lawyer-ism.<br/><br/>Included in the rules are the 'free form&quot; (hexless) movement rules that have been in use for years; the hex map is scaled for miniatures bases, and the game is designed to be easy to port over to miniatures adaptations.<br/><br/>",

By cleverly positioning these guests (and by manipulating the guests of your opponents), you'll vie for the attention of Venice's elite guild masters, ensuring the most political power for your family.<br/><br/>Gameplay revolves chiefly around the clever use of guest cards with varying levels of influence. Each player receives a hand of guest cards, and each guest card has an influence value and its own power, e.g., the peddler, the assasin and the gondolier. The higher the influence, the greater that guest's clout at court. Each player's hand consists of a mix of cards representing members of any of the families currently in play. Use a rival family's guest cards against them, and watch for chances to set up your own house for success.<br/><br/>Each of the rooms of the Doge's palace offer tokens representing a guild's favor or valuable ducats to be won by ambitious nobles. The spaces between each card that represents a room in the palace are the hallways of the Doge's estate &ndash; the areas in which guest cards are placed to compete for adjacent resources.<br/><br/>",

On a turn, a player moves to either an empty spot on the path to claim one of the tiles located there or to an occupied spot. In the latter case, the attacking player must sacrifice a viking, then the defending player must sacrifice two vikings or vacate the space; if they sac two vikings, then the attacker must remove three or leave. Eventually, someone must leave.<br/><br/>You can collect runes with an eye toward having lots of the same type or collect goods to sell at the end of the round. You might gather axes to give you better odds against monsters. You can collect more vikings for your crew.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players score majority bonuses depending on the tiles that were revealed before the round started.

        "description": "Trick Shot is a tense, tactical, fast-paced game of ice hockey with cool plastic miniatures and a streamlined rule-set. The game strikes a fine balance between luck and strategy, while still being easy to explain and get to the table. Use smart positioning, special abilities of your skaters, and press your luck to outplay your opponent and score the most goals. Whether you are a hardcore hockey fan or a board-gamer looking for a challenging tactical skirmish, we&rsquo;ve got you covered!<br/><br/>Trick Shot is played over three periods, each period consisting of 10 turns. Whoever scores the most goals by the end of the third period wins.<br/><br/>On your turn, you may keep activating skaters, as long as the same skater is not activated twice in a row or a turnover is triggered by failing a dice roll. However, after each activation, a die is added to your pool, making each following activation more difficult.<br/><br/>Rolling a Reaction result lets your opponent perform a short move with one of their skaters, limiting the downtime to a minimum.<br/><br/>Double fail results in a penalty and gets your skater off the ice and may cost you control of the puck.<br/><br/>Stamina tokens can be used to mitigate luck by re-rolling failed activations.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Players take on either the role of the United States, struggling to protect itself from foreign threat, or the role of one or more of the invading armies, fighting battle after battle to acquire important territories.<br/><br/>If the invading forces claim enough U.S. cities, America's defense is broken and the nation falls. But if the United States can protect its cities for long enough, the invading forces fail to uproot America and their incursion is ended.<br/><br/>Fortress America is played over several rounds in which each player musters his forces, moves into enemy-controlled territories, and engages in fierce firefights. But depending on whether you're the U.S. player or one of the Invaders, your play experience and general strategy will be entirely different. The U.S. must efficiently wield its colossal lasers, the ultimate weapons of mass destruction, in its own defense. What's more, as U.S. hovertanks, helicopters, bombers, and infantry are destroyed and removed from the map, a steady supply of American guerilla fighters spring up to defend their homeland. The U.S. player is surrounded and alone, and must do his best to fend off advances on three fronts in a series of tense battles.<br/><br/>The Invaders, on the other hand, must remain constantly aggressive. Their objective is to collectively capture 18 of 30 major U.S. cities, and to do so, they must apply early pressure before the U.S. has a chance to react, and keep the pressure constant. To complicate the Invaders' mission, their armies do not receive additional reinforcements, so they must make optimal use of the forces at their disposal. Through a series of nail-biting battles that use a unique dice-based combat system, each player will maneuver his dwindling armies to secure his objective. But can America be stopped, or will a failed invasion only compel them to tighten their military grip on the world.<br/><br/>Changed in this edition:<br/><br/><br/>     Custom combat dice, debatable if better than normal dice.<br/>     A ten-turn timer gives the U.S. player an additional path to victory: outlasting the invasion.<br/>     A &quot;Captured City&quot; track lets all players see, at a quick glance, how close they are to victory or defeat.<br/>     A few city locations have been removed, and others added, to create a different (possibly more balanced) play experience.<br/>     A deck of variant cards for the Invader players has been added to use as a rules option (equal to 1-2 balance levels).<br/><br/><br/>Reimplements:<br/><br/>    Fortress America (1986)<br/><br/><br/>",

As they gather their mystical relics, they note the passing of the moons, which amplify the power of certain schools of magic, allowing wizards to cast spells at the peak of their power!<br/><br/>Arcana Rising is a drafting and engine-building game in which players compete over three rounds to craft a magical engine that will power their collected artifacts and generate points for them at the end of the game.<br/><br/>On a turn, players select a single card from the pile they are passed. Once a card has been selected, players pass the remaining cards clockwise, then choose whether to add the newly acquired card to their tableau OR to discard the card in order to run their engine and cast their spells. Randomized moon tokens tell players which of their spells may be cast. Therefore, the timing of executing your powers is nearly as important as the powers themselves.<br/><br/>The cards fall into schools of Charms, Herbology, Blood Arts, Potions, Alchemy, and Artifacts. Only a single type of spell can be cast each turn,  depending on a randomized order for that round.<br/><br/>After three rounds of drafting, players calculate their scores based on the unique set of artifacts they have collected, and the player with the most victory points wins!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Firefly: Adventures is a cooperative, mission based, skirmish-level miniatures wargame where the players use the different skills and abilities of Malcolm, Zo&euml;, Jayne, Kaylee and Wash to succeed. The game contains two distinct miniature game pieces for each crew member, one in Casual relaxed pose, the other in a Heroic action pose. Crew may choose to Act Casual or Act Heroic and each pose has a unique set of actions that the Crew can perform on their turn, but be warned &ndash; while no one&rsquo;s gonna pay much mind to someone with a casual demeanor, acting all heroic is sure to attract unwanted attention.<br/><br/>When you and the Crew get to work, a Job Briefing will tell you all you need to know; what your Crew needs to accomplish, how they might succeed and how long they have to get it done. Some Jobs are easier and faster, some are longer and more involved. What type of Job you want to tackle is up to you. You can work a single Job, or a series of Jobs, using the Credits you earn from one Job to equip the Crew for the next Job.<br/> Working a Job is never easy, there&rsquo;s always some manner of malcontents standing in your way. You and the Crew are sure to run afoul of hired Goons, whether it&rsquo;s a posse of unruly Cowboys or a gang of Eavesdown Docks Thugs. Depending on the circumstances, you may be able to talk your way out of trouble or distract them with some technical know-what. If not, then the situation may require a bit of violence! Brigands &amp; Browncoats includes ten unique detailed Goon game pieces; five Cowboys and five Thugs.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battleship Galaxies is a space combat miniatures game that is a distant cousin to the original Battleship game. The two opposing forces represented in the game, the human Intergalactic Space Navy and the alien Wretcheridians, are represented by 20 starship miniatures. There are figures for several different ship types and each has an individual reference card that defines the characteristics (e.g., weapons, movement, shields) of that ship.<br/><br/>The game is scenario driven and each scenario defines the goal of the game as well as the initial setup of the starfield hex board. Each turn, players have a certain number of energy points that can be spent to perform actions such as movement or firing. Combat is resolved by rolling special dice: a 10-sided die with letters and an eight-sided die with numbers. The resulting letter-number combination is compared to the target ship&rsquo;s reference card to determine the result. Hits on a ship are indicated by placing colored pegs in the figure&rsquo;s base.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Subdivision mimics the city-building feel of B&eacute;zier Games' Suburbia, but differs in scope as now each player has been allocated a specific area in which to create the best possible subdivision, filling it with residential, commercial, industrial, civic, and luxury zones, while balancing various improvements to the area, including roads, schools, parks, sidewalks, and lakes. By the end of the game, each player will have created a unique, custom neighborhood with areas that interact with each other, hoping to outscore the competition by having the best subdivision.<br/><br/>In the game, each player starts with a subdivision player board and a hand of hex-shaped zone tiles. A parcel die is rolled to indicate the type of parcel where a zone tile may be placed, and all players simultaneously place one of their tiles. If a zone tile is placed next to existing zone tiles, those existing tiles have the ability to create new improvements, which may also be placed at this time. Those improvements provide money and points, while slowly covering up as many parcels as possible. Players pass the remaining zone tiles in hand to their left, then someone rolls the parcel die once again. This continues until only one zone tile remains in hand, which is discarded.<br/><br/>Players then play another round, but at the start of the second, third, and fourth rounds, players first check to see whether they've achieved bonuses, which give them extra cash or allow for extra activations of certain zone tiles.<br/><br/>After four rounds, the game ends, and scores are tallied, with players gaining points for parks being adjacent to other tiles, sidewalks passing through as many different zones and improvements as possible, schools ranking the best in the city, and zones connecting to the highway that runs around (or through) your subdivision.<br/><br/>",

Acting troupes from all over the land will come together to perform plays of light-hearted comedy or soul-wrenching tragedy. Will their performance win the favour of the king or will his fickle mood spell a flop?<br/><br/>In Histrio, you travel the land recruiting actors to join your troupe. Assemble the right team and you might earn enough money to pay for an entire year of shows. It'll take careful planning and a little luck to out-perform your competitors. The play is the thing in Histrio, and the world is your stage!<br/><br/>At the beginning of each round, cards are dealt to eight cities where players can travel to recruit actors. Some of the cards are actors, some grant money, and several are animal characters with special abilities. Players then secretly select a city where they will travel, and all players simultaneously reveal their chosen cities. If a city was chosen by only one player, that player gets all cards at the city. If a city was chosen by more than one, all cards are discarded, each player gets a secret objective card instead, and any actor cards are used to influence the king's mood toward either comedies or tragedies. At the end of the season, players earn money based on how many comedian or tragedian actors they have compared to the king's mood. The player with the most money at the end of two seasons wins.<br/><br/>",

It is the second volume in GMT Games' Levy &amp; Campaign Series portraying medieval military operations.<br/><br/>Players will raise and equip their armies and send them out to ravage or conquer disputed territory and defeat enemy forces.  Service obligations and alliances will provide a panoply of lords and vassals to serve on campaign  but only for limited periods.  Players must keep an eye on the calendar and reward lords to keep them in the field.<br/><br/>The sides every 40 days will levy various lords and vassals and their forces, transport, and capabilities, backed by higher political authorities.  Each lord is rated for fealty, lordship, service, and command and lays out his forces and assets on a mat.  Wooden pieces represent units of knights, mounted sergeants, horse and foot units from North Africa, men-at-arms, light horse, militia, and serfs.  Assets include counters for transport such as carts and mule trains; provender to feed the army; and coin to pay for longer service or loot captured by ravaging or conquering enemy regions.<br/><br/>The players then plan and command a campaign for that 40 days with the lords who have mustered.  To represent the limits of communications on medieval operations, stacks of command cards commit players to activating lords in a sequence that may or may not meet the needs of the developing situation.  Cylinder pieces on the map show the lords&rsquo; maneuvers, while markers on a feudal calendar show how much longer the lords will serve, influenced by success or failure in their campaigns. When lords clash in field battle or storming a castle, players array their lords&rsquo; mats left, right, center, and reserve and attempt to rout the enemy. Various event and capability cards reveal cultural and technological particulars that influence levy, campaign, and combat.<br/><br/>Almoravid is solitaire friendly, or players can use optional screens to hide what the two players' lords levy.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

To do this, you must outsmart your rivals by being a clever investor, bidding on the right city tiles, and creating your own little district of Naples.<br/><br/>Over the course of five game rounds, players first have to plan their actions carefully, choosing whether they want to invest in new pizzerias, make express deliveries, get sponsored by the bank, or decide to expand their district. Once all players have used up their action tokens, players get rewarded by receiving Lira, which they can then use in a bidding phase to determine how many deliveries you can make, and how many pizzas you can deliver. Once you deliver pizzas to your hungry customers, they reward you by boosting your abilities, making each action more powerful as the game progresses. Every decision counts, but Pap&agrave; Paolo is a very accessible game, which will charm players of all ages alike.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Settlers of Canaan takes place in the territory of Canaan off the coast of the Great Sea.  Each Player represents a tribe of Israel as they seek to settle the land of Canaan. The time period of the game spans the time of Joshua's conquests of Canaan (Joshua), the turbulent years ruled by judges (Judges) through the choosing and crowning of King David (I &amp; II Samuel).<br/><br/>The game uses the same basic mechanics as Settlers of Catan but adds some unique elements, similar to the Historical Scenarios. In the case of this game, players build the wall of Jerusalem by contributing bricks. The player who contributes the most bricks earns victory points and the right to use a special &quot;rule-breaking&quot; power of his/her choosing. This is contested in the same manner as &quot;the longest road&quot; from Settlers.<br/><br/>The German version does not use the build Jeruselem and stones mechanisms. Instead there are 13 hero cards that generate God's help. There are events (cards) that take place. Also the German board has 5 hexes not on the English board and one changed hex as well.<br/>Belongs to the Catan Series.<br/><br/>",

Everyone speculated, and many become millionaires overnight.<br/><br/>In Mogul &mdash; a revised and expanded version of the 2002 game of the same name &mdash; players buy and sell railway stock, trying to outsmart both the opponents and the market. Each of the five railroad companies has five to eight shares, and in addition to being a share of the company, each share card has a box on it that indicates another company. Players start with particular stock holdings based on the number of players in the game and their position in turn order.<br/><br/>Each turn, one stock card is revealed from the deck. Players earn $1 for each share of this color that they own, then an auction ensues. Turn by turn, players must drop one of their bidding chips into a bowl in order to stay in the auction. When a player passes, whether by necessity or choice, they take all of the chips from the bowl, thereby earning bidding power for future auctions.<br/><br/>When all but one player has passed, this last player wins the auction and has the right to either keep the share or sell stock matching the color of the company depicted on the bottom of the share; the player who dropped out of the auction last takes the action that the winner didn't take. If a player sells stock, they either sell all shares of this color that they own, earning as much for each share as the number of those stock cards face up on the table or they sell none of them; in the latter case, the player places a station depot in their color on an empty space of the appropriate color on the game board. This game board has multiple networks in the five colors of the game, and at game's end each depot has a dollar value equal to the number of that player's depots in the same network.<br/><br/>When the crash card is revealed from the deck, the game ends. Players earn $1 for each share still in front of them and each five bidding chips they hold, in addition to the value of their depots. Whoever has the most money wins!<br/><br/>",

The Kraken plans to make a nice stew out of them. Can you prise open his tentacles, release your friends, and defeat him? Hope so. Oh, it's probably not a good time to mention the shark...<br/><br/>Poseidon's Kingdom features a wave that crashes dice onto the board and the engaging game play of the highly-praised anthill system (from Antics!). On their turns, players first decide whether to improve their abilities by taking an &quot;action tile&quot; or place some of their personal dice onto the big 3D-wave, which is rolled over, when full, distributing up to 15 dice in a couple of seconds randomly all over the board.<br/><br/>Second, they move one of their two creatures on the main board, trying to land on a spot where they can pick up dice of any color they need. If they do, they can either store the dice on special spaces of their action tiles for later use OR put together a special combination of 2-4 dice to get victory point tokens, then place the dice back to the pools from where they came.<br/><br/>Third, the shark moves as many spaces as the space the creature landed on indicates. If the shark meets one or more creatures on its way, they are eaten and players get &quot;skeletons&quot; to block one of their action spaces.<br/><br/>After a special scoring round, in the end the player who collected the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>The second edition of Poseidon's Kingdom introduces the dolphin, which can make your creatures immune to the shark.<br/><br/>",

All the players are cavemen, however, so you have only rough blocks with which to build and you can communicate only through primitive gestures and sounds. Ugungu!<br/><br/>When you're the architect on your team, you see a building plan that shows how the blocks should be placed in the finished design. To get the builders on your team to do the heavy work, you must tell them which piece to use &ndash; through gestures like stomping your feet or raising your arms above your head &ndash; and what to do with it. &quot;Manungu&quot; tells them to put the piece at the front of the structure, while &quot;Manungu manungu&quot; means to put it at the back. Moving pieces left or right, up or down, laying them down or rotating them &ndash; lots of details need to be conveyed with only a few commands and your trusty (inflatable) spiked club. When you give a command and your team performs well, tap them on the head once to show approval. Hit them twice, though, and they know they messed up and need to pay better attention.

You have to manage the health of your town's gate, the tower, and the local farm. In addition, this attack is causing fear levels to rise. If you cannot keep your gate standing or if the fear of the townspeople gets too high, you lose the game. If, however, you can hold off the swarm of enemies long enough, you will be victorious!<br/><br/>Gate uses deck-building as the driving mechanism in the game. You start with three starting cards, but as the game progresses you can recruit new people from your town to help your cause. Each character has unique abilities, and some even have special powers. The enemies in the game get increasingly more difficult with each new wave, so you have to make good choices as to when to spend resources on fighting off your foes, upgrading your command, and repairing your town.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Survivors may bring new skills to help you in your desperate fight for survival, or in some cases, new challenges to overcome. You'll also need them along if you want to win as every survivor provides you victory points.<br/><br/>This streamlined version removes several decks from the original game, including the Fleeing deck and Event deck. Players rolls six dice instead of five and there are now different combos to mitigate against tough zombie-filled rolls. Additionally, players can now use followers to soak damage coming in from zombies.<br/><br/>The game ends either when one player dies, the Town Line comes out of the locations deck, or when the Mutant Zombie has been put down once and for all.  Whoever has the most leadership points among surviving players wins.<br/><br/>Run, Fight, or Die: Reloaded is a frantic first person experience for 1 to 4 players (will play up to 6 with the 5/6 player expansion).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The stakes are high in this high-energy, competitive, and cut-throat, set-collection card game from Grandpa Beck's Games!<br/><br/>In Cover Your Assets, players compete to become the first millionaire by building towers of matching sets made from 10 different types of asset cards (things like jewels, piggy banks, classic autos, and more). Each new set that is created is stacked crosswise on top of the previous set, covering, and protecting, all the sets beneath it.<br/><br/>The top set of assets in your pile is vulnerable, and can be stolen by other players if they show you a matching asset card, or wild (which are Silver and Gold cards) from their hand. You can defend your stack by showing the challenger a matching card from your own hand. If you do, they can counter with another matching card of their own. The battle rages back and forth until one player can't respond, or bows out.<br/><br/>If you win, you keep the set, if the challenger wins, they take the set. Regardless of who wins, ALL the cards used in the challenge are added to the set, increasing its value and allure to other players.<br/><br/>To keep the set from being stolen by another player, the best thing you can do is to Cover Your Assets, by creating a new pair from your hand, or by stealing a set from the top of another player's stack during your next turn.<br/><br/>At the end of the round scores are tallied, the cards are shuffled, and a new round begins. The first player to reach $1,000,000 wins!<br/><br/>Cover Your Assets is quick to learn, and simple to play, yet surprisingly addictive and strategic. The game plays with 4-6 players, and is a great for mixed groups as kids, teens, parents, and grandparents alike can learn the game in minutes and enjoy it for hours.<br/><br/>The 2021 edition contains advanced rules, new cards, and rules for 2 &amp; 3 players!<br/><br/>Be warned: This is not a good game for sore losers!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The first three games in the Series: Men of Iron (GMT): Men of Iron, Infidel, and Blood & Roses, plus the Battle of Agincourt from C3i #22.<br/><br/>The game that started it all, Men of Iron, covers the re-emergence of infantry in the early 14th century, along with a more perceptive understanding of the value of combined-arms warfare and the effective use of defensive terrain. The scenarios highlight the key elements that made these battles so fascinating: the defensive power of the longbow, especially when used in coordination with dismounted, or even mounted, men-at-arms. Agincourt covers Henry V&rsquo;s famous victory during the Hundred Years War.<br/><br/>The second volume in the  Men of Iron series, Infidel, focuses on the major battles of the early Crusades era between Christians and the Muslims. This is a period that saw cavalry reign supreme and pitted the European mounted, armored men-at-arms - which relied on furious and direct charges with sword and lance - against the Eastern European/Turkish light cavalry tactics - focusing on the efficiency of its mounted archers.<br/><br/>Blood & Roses  focuses on the battles of the Wars of the Roses in England, between 1455 and 1487. This was warfare in which most men were truly &quot;of iron&quot;, heavily and totally armored to such a point that their mobility was suspect. It also featured the introduction of gunpowder &ndash; mostly field artillery &ndash; in noticeable numbers. And while many English men-at-arms were mounted, they did so almost entirely for transport. Most fighting was on foot &hellip; and it was quite vicious.<br/><br/>There will be a series rulebook, with a few rules still applying only to a specific game, and the games will have all errata applied to their battle book. The color setups a la Blood & Roses and Arquebus: Men of Iron Volume IV – The Battles for Northern Italy 1495-1544 will show up in all battle books. Men of Iron will see some battle changes, a few of which will involve new/changed counters.<br/><br/>The series is designed for quick learning and easy play. Game rules are short, there are no turns - play is continual, with opportunities to steal play from your opponent - and combat resolution is a single dieroll. Playing time is about 1-to-3 hours per battle.<br/><br/>The series is also for the gamer who enjoys playing solitaire. The system is designed for both individual and face-to-face play without any loss in insight or fun. It allows a player or players to see what happened in these famous battles and why. There are no purpose-built solitaire rules, but many players play that way.<br/><br/>The units feature longbows, crossbows, men-at-arms (mounted, dismounted, and unhorsed), hobilars, genitors, nasty Scots with axes, slingers, pike infantry, knights, heavy cavalry, medium cavalry, light cavalry archers, archers, camp followers, handgunners, and artillery! And the commanders! The great English King, Edward III and his son, The Black Prince, William Wallace and The Bruce, Captal de Buch.  Crusaders Stephen of Blois, Bohemond of Taranto, Raymond of Toulouse, Bishop Adhemar of Le Puy, the leper King Baldwin IV, Raynald of Chatillon, and King Richard I. Saracen leaders Kilij Arslan, Kerbogha, Atabeg of Mosul,  Fatimid Vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah, Soqman the Artukid of Diyar-Bakr and Aleppo, and Saladin. King Henry VI, Richard, Duke of York, King Edward IV, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, King Richard III, and Henry Tudor, Earl of Richmond (and founder of the Tudor dynasty).<br/><br/>The battles included in the Men of Iron tri-pack are:<br/><br/><br/>    Dorylaeum &ndash; Northwest Anatolia, 1 July 1097 - The Crusader line of march, including the people&rsquo;s Crusade and Peter the hermit, as well as all the great 1st Crusade Leaders, are &ldquo;ambushed&rdquo; by Kilij Arslan and his crack Seljuk cavalry.   <br/>    Antioch &ndash; Northern Syrian, 28 June 1098 - The exhausted, starving and depleted Crusaders &ndash; they had few horses left &ndash; have just taken Antioch and are now faced with a large Turkish army, under Kerbogha, sent to retake the city.   <br/>    Ascalon &ndash; Southern Palestine, 12 August 1099 - The Crusaders, having seized Jerusalem, turn south to fend off the suddenly active large army of the Fatimids, with their crack Mamluk heavy cavalry.   <br/>    Harran &ndash; Crusader Kingdom of Antioch/Edessa, 7 May 1104 - Baldwin II of Edessa seeks to maintain control of his little kingdom in northern Syria, something Soqman, Atabeg of Damascus, is not happy to allow. One of the first major Crusader defeats.   <br/>    Montgisard &ndash; Frankish Kingdom of Jerusalem, 25 November 1177 - Saladin attempts to destroy a small army from the Kingdom of Jerusalem with an army more than five times its size. Though there are only 400 knights, the Crusaders are led by the remarkable Baldwin IV, The Leper King. The outcome - one of the greatest Crusader victories. See if you can carry off this stunning upset!   <br/>    Arsuf - Ayyubid Kingdom of Jerusalem, 7 September 1191 - The classic battle between Richard I Lionheart and the Ayyubid Army of Saladin highlighting the major facets of each army in an unusual moving battle.<br/>    Falkirk - Scotland, 22 July 1298 - Wallace's great disaster, despite his massive schiltron. Good infantry is fine, but it needs support. The ultimate solitaire scenario. <br/>    Courtrai - Flanders, 11 July 1302 - The Battle of the Golden Spurs. The Flemish shook the elite French army with one of the earliest displays of the power of solid infantry using defensive positions. <br/>    Bannockburn - Scotland, 23-24 June 1314 - Robert the Bruce's famous triumph over a numerically superior, but literally bogged down English army. <br/>    Crecy - France, 26 August 1346 - The first great battle of the Hundred Years War. It showed that infantry, supported by archers, could defeat the best knights in Europe. <br/>    Poitiers - France, 19 September 1356 - The French fight dismounted this time and almost win. But the longbow, and solid English infantry prevail again. <br/>    Najera - Castile, 3 April 1367 - The Black Prince goes to Spain with a marvelous combined arms force to further English plans of &quot;expansion&quot;. <br/>    Agincourt &ndash; Artois, 25 October 1415 &ndash; Henry V wins a mighty victory against the flower of French chivalry. <br/>    1st St. Albans &ndash; Hertfordshire, 22 May 1455 - Marks the first major engagement in the Wars of the Roses. Richard, Duke of York and his ally, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, defeated the Lancastrians under Edmund, Duke of Somerset, who was killed during the battle. York also captured Henry VI and forced Henry to appoint him Constable of England  <br/>    Blore Heath &ndash; Staffordshire, 23 September 1459 - Greatly outnumbered Yorkist infantry used the longbow and a defensive position to drive off the Lancastrian Men-at-Arms. <br/>    2nd St. Albans &ndash; Hertfordshire, 17 February 1461 - The Lancastrians drove the Yorkists out of the town and then destroyed Warwick&rsquo;s strangely deployed army, even when sturdily defended by hedges, caltrops and spiked netting. <br/>    Towton &ndash; Yorkshire, 29 March 1461 - Easily biggest battle in the box and the biggest in the entire series. It uses over 200 combat units and, much like the actual battle, will probably take a long time to play. It is mostly crash and bash, with little room for maneuver, all fought in a blinding snowstorm!!  <br/>    Barnet &ndash; Greater London Area, 14 April 1471 - A classic battle of planned deployments, but overlapping wings, cries of treason in the lines, fog of war (actual fog), and the excellent use of reserves. <br/>    Tewksbury &ndash; Gloucestershire, 4 May 1471 - A battle that shows one of the key terrain features of the battles in this era, extensive hedges and thick underbrush in otherwise clear fields. <br/>    Bosworth &ndash; Leicestershire, 22 August 1485 - The best-known battle of the wars and the tragic (I think) death of King Richard III in a battle he should have won. Using the latest information as to where the battle took place, let&rsquo;s see if you can cancel out the Tudor dynasty.<br/><br/><br/>Components:<br/>Five 22x34&rdquo; maps<br/>Seven counter sheets (six and one-half 1/2&rdquo; + one-half 9/16&rdquo;)<br/>One 36 page series rulebook<br/>Three battle books (two 24 page and one 36 page)<br/>Six player aid cards (four 11x17&rdquo; and two 11x25.5&rdquo;)<br/>Two flight point charts (8.5 x 11&rdquo;)<br/>Two ten-sided dice<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "On a map showing the western portion of the United States, each player takes turns building track to extend any of five major railroad lines westward from their originating cities.  Players often want the lines to extend in different directions toward the cities that they have a stake in. Some branching is allowed, but each line has a limited number of track pieces.<br/> Stakes for specific cities are accumulated throughout the game by drawing blind from a deck of city cards.  The more different lines arriving at a city, the higher the score will be for that city.  Later in the game, four short lines also become available.<br/><br/>An updated version of Alan R. Moon's White Wind game Santa Fe.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>The deck is composed of city cards (with some short lines shuffled into the middle third). Players have a hand of 4 city cards to start the game. Each round, players simultaneously select a card to play, then reveal. City cards are added to your personal display -- essentially, you have a share in that city. There are also several special cards (2x, 3x, 4-in-one, Branch Line, Boomtown) that modify the basic game turn. These specials are on public display, and can be acquired at the end of each round (some cost $1; the 2x may be held, but the rest must be played immediately after acquiring them).<br/><br/>Then, in turn order, going twice around, players add a single track to any of the railheads (each of the 5 lines has specific starting locations on the board). If the link is to a previously unconnected city, collect $2. In addition, if the city is one of the goal cities of that train line, collect $4.<br/><br/>After all players have gone (twice), pass the start player marker to the left. THEN, in turn order, players bring their hand total back to 4 (draw from deck and/or from cards on display). If a Short Line card is revealed, discard the card and draw again; that Short Line is now in play. They choose a card to play, and repeat above.<br/><br/>The game ends when tracks for 3 lines are completely used. Each city's value is equal to its base value, printed on board, multiplied by the number of different train lines connected to it. The player with the most cash and city value wins!<br/><br/>",

Play as one of eight diabolical super villains, competing to steal the world&rsquo;s priceless artifacts before your opponents have a chance.<br/><br/>In Word Domination, you will ransack, backstab, and steal your way to victory. Each turn, players spell a word using any of the available letters on the board, canvassing the priceless artifacts they contain. On subsequent turns, players attempt to steal those letters, claiming them for the player&rsquo;s exclusive use. A cunning player will carefully select which letters to steal, as adjacent letters are more valuable at the end. The winner of Word Domination is often not the player with the largest vocabulary. The strategic use of the board can give a player the edge they need to come out on top.<br/><br/>Players must balance their desire to expand their territory by spelling massive words with a need to steal specific artifacts, claiming them for their own exclusive use. Players must also keep their opponents in check, preventing them from locking down significant areas of the board. And don&rsquo;t ignore those hard-to-use letters, which wield unique and powerful effects that can alter the entire game.<br/><br/>Wordsmiths enjoy the freedom to create colossal words from a large and initially open playing board. And strategists revel in their ability to control the board, blocking their opponents and expanding their territory with targeted letter attacks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BATTALIA: The Creation is a competitive, fast-paced, strategic deck-builder that combines map construction, hero and area control and unique calendar mechanisms.<br/><br/>In the base game, all players will buy useful artefacts and hire battle and labor units to support their armies. They will build roads and cities and send their heroes to battle - every opponent will have to find the most powerful mixture of all these assets and apply them at the right moment, so eventually the player could claim to be the rightful ruler of Battalia and win the game. A victory can be obtained through aggressive conquest or a peaceful development of your own city system (if a player is lucky enough and the others let him ... :). Battalia has 2 game end conditions - full conclusion of the game board or first player, who achieves 5 cities of level four, immediately ends the game. The winner is the player with the most victory points at the and of the game and this is not necessary the same person, who made the final cut!<br/><br/>An immersive game play will provide the opportunity for the players to make key decisions and turn the tides of even the grimmest of outcomes. A player can outmaneuver and BE outmaneuvered by his opponents at any point in the game.<br/>Dynamic atmosphere and intense battles are key factors in the overall experience, however the game strives to stimulate analytic thinking and strategy over rash and impulsive decisions.<br/>In general this is not a luck based game, because of the core deck building mechanics, but a die is integrated as an optional element and is the ingredient, which spices up the game for all the fortunate fellows! You will find also an element of bluffing, when you fight your battles, so put the poker face on and be ready to outsmart your opponent.<br/>The game is defined by the unique combination of mechanics, aesthetic art style, and the presence of large scale 3D Hero figures in four colors, representing the leaders of the players army and their movement on the board.<br/><br/>The calendar mechanics is implemented in the Sun Oracle, shortly called Orac, as it is a key element of the game. The Oracle is almighty ancient monument, eternal apprentice of the nature itself and the hand of the gods among humans and beasts. The Oracle provides advantages to the players (every day a different one) and it could support them, if they catch the lucky moment on a sunny day... It counts the days and guides the leaders through the never-ending competition between the folks that inhabit these lands: The B&auml;rfolk, The Emberians, The Islanders and The Cloudborn.<br/>Four factions coexist in the world of Battalia. Most of the cards in the game (units, artefacts and terrain cards) and the 8 figures belong to one of the four factions. A leading concept in the game is that the four factions can freely collaborate with each other, but many units from the same faction, using their own artefacts, are much stronger together. Also, unlike all other games where the players choose their factions, in this game the factions choose the players...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Not to be confused with divinatory tarot, the game of tarot probably comes from Italy. It is played with a 78-card deck that has 56 suited cards (similar to the 52-card Poker deck, with the addition of a Cavalier or Knight court card between the Jack and Queen in each suit), plus 21 suitless trump cards in ascending rank, and one &quot;Fool&quot;, similar to the Joker but with differing origins.<br/><br/>In the most popular tarot game, called French Tarot in most English-speaking countries, one of the players will be the taker who will be playing against all the other players. The takers' goal is to make a certain amount of points in order to fulfill the contract which the taker player bids on at the beginning of the game. The goal of the other players (called the defense) is to stop the taker from achieving their score. The defense plays as a team against the taker.<br/><br/>After receiving their hand, the players will take turns betting on a contract based on whether they think they can achieve the number of points required. The last player to place a bet will become the taker.<br/><br/>A large number of European card games are played with either the full tarot deck or a subset of it, often re-faced in Germanic or other Eastern European motifs.<br/><br/>",

Centerville abstractly models the growth and management of a small city &mdash; perhaps not unlike the one you're in right now.<br/><br/>Players act as entrepreneurs, tycoons, politicians, and other local movers and shakers working to develop a modern urban area. Fortunes will be made and fame will rise. As time goes by, personal milestones will enrich the players even further.<br/><br/>Throughout the game, players will roll six dice, keeping some and rerolling others, then implementing the various die faces on the game board. This will result in political offices being gained and lost, new vocations learned, new land acquired, or new buildings constructed. The end result is a vibrant community revered near and wide &mdash; but only the player who has best balanced their wealth and prestige will emerge the final victor.<br/><br/>Playing time is 15-20 minutes per player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publishers website:<br/><br/>TARGET FOR TODAY is a solitaire game that recreates American's Daylight Strategic Bombing Campaign against Nazi Occupied Europe during the Second World War. Considerable research, including review of many oral histories gathered from veterans who flew heavy bombers in the Daylight Strategic Bombing Campaign was done to make Target For Today! function as closely as possible to reality. The game was designed to provide YOU, the player, with the ultimate gaming experience depicting the same types of events and decision making processes experienced by our veterans who flew the real-life missions.<br/><br/>Now, YOU are in command of an individual bomber on an individual mission over Hitler's Third Reich -flying either the B-17F or G Model Flying Fortress or the B24D, or J Model Liberator bomber. A series of individual missions are strung together in the campaign game to form the player's tour of duty. Just as it was in real life, the objective of the game for the player is to survive your tour of duty so you can rotate home.<br/><br/>The US Army Air Forces suffered one of the highest casualty rates of any branch of the military services including the US Marine Corps during World War II. The heavy bomber groups of the 8th Air Force flew a combined total of 10,631 strike missions over Europe during the period of this game. The 8th Air Force lost 4145 bombers on these missions. Surviving your tour of duty could be difficult!<br/><br/>TARGET FOR TODAY is an advanced update of Glen Frank's classic game B17, QUEEN OF THE SKIES. Some familiarity with that game is assumed, but &quot;TARGET FOR TODAY&quot; is a completely new game -you do not need to own B-17, QUEEN OF THE SKIES to play it. New tables are included and the rules are organized according to the sequence of play in any typical mission. TARGET FOR TODAY is designed so that each individual mission is fast and easy to play. The campaign game that comprises your tour of duty offers the player a game that is rich in detail, making the game as realistic as possible while still remaining playable.<br/><br/>In the tradition of B-17 Queen of the Skies, and following in the foot steps of B-29 Superfortress, comes a new solitaire game from Steve Dixon. Bob Best and Shawn Rife Steve Dixon. Tentatively titled &quot;Bombs Away!&quot;, it has been renamed &quot;Target for Today!&quot;. Fly a single mission, a single campaign or fly the entire air campaign from 1942 to 1945 with the 8th or 15th Air Force, piloting either a B-17F, B17G, B24D, B24J and for those so inclined, the YB-40.<br/> The target list will be greatly expanded for the 8th and 15th Air Forces. Enemy planes we plan to provide are the Me-109, Fw-190, Ju-88, Me-110, Me-210, Me-410, He-162, Me-163, Me-262, and Ta-152.<br/><br/>For more information visit the Consimworld Forum at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/.1dd58f17\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://talk.consimworld.com/WebX/.1dd58f17</a><br/><br/>Battle Board 11&quot; x 17&quot; (mounted) <br/>Game Counters 176 each .6&quot; 56 each 1.2&quot;<br/>Cards (3&quot;x4&quot;) 5 Bomber Types<br/>Rules Book 44 pages<br/>Chart Book 32 pages<br/>Target Book 56 pages<br/>Flight Manual 24 pages<br/>Crew Boards 5 ea. 11&quot; x 17&quot;<br/>Player Aids 10 ea. 8.5&quot; x 11&quot;<br/><br/>",

If a row is full, then whoever played that final card takes all of the cards already in the row, scoring negative points for all of the bullheads on those cards.<br/><br/>X nimmt! changes these rules a few ways. Each player starts with eight cards in hand and a personal X row. Played cards will be placed into three rows, with those rows being able to hold three, four or five cards. Whenever someone takes cards from a row, those cards go into the player's hand, then the player must play one card into their personal X row.<br/><br/>All cards in this X row must also be played in ascending order! If you can't do this, then you place all of those X cards aside in order to start a new X row, with the value of those set-aside cards now being doubled.<br/><br/>A round ends after someone plays the final card in their hand, and whoever has the fewest negative points after two rounds wins.<br/><br/>This game was called Take A Number when included in the two game set Take 5 & Take A Number.<br/><br/>",

Hordes of enemies are crossing the borders, famine spreads throughout the provinces and the political intrigues are tearing the empire apart from within. The previous emperor was killed by his own Praetorian bodyguard and has left a power vacuum that the powerful families in Rome are trying to fill.

Each player leads a powerful family in ancient Rome, trying to get the most victory points during 4 rounds. If your family member becomes the emperor and manages to hold the position he can earn lots of points. However he will also become the target of the other players as they will try to dethrone him and become the new emperor themselves.<br/><br/>",

You are all looking forward to relaxing and spending some of your hard-earned loot at The Red Dragon Inn. The party will have to wait, though, because the city is under attack by evil monsters!<br/><br/>Battle for Greyport is a cooperative deck-building game based on the characters and world of The Red Dragon Inn. You will travel to important locations around the city, fighting epic battles and recruiting whatever heroes and items you can along the way. Each encounter presents more opportunities to improve your deck, but also brings more dire foes for you to face!<br/><br/>With five playable characters, seven different scenarios, and an assortment of variants, you can have a new game every time, adjusting the game&rsquo;s difficulty as you improve.<br/><br/>Will you defend the city from the monsters and defeat their nefarious boss, or will the city (and the tavern!) be overrun?<br/><br/>The Red Dragon Inn: Battle for Greyport also contains two items for use with any of the standalone The Red Dragon Inn titles: Chronos the Time Mage character deck and Drog's Special Reserve drink card. The Deluxe Edition also includes Firewater of the Fire Mage and The Iridescent Wyvern.<br/><br/>",

One player commands the convoy of powerful robots, and his goal is to reach New York and turn it into ashes. The player has a deck of 35 cards: robots of Moloch (such as the Gauss Cannon, Clown, or Juggernaut), modules to attach to the robots (Network module, Kasparov module), and special cards (such as Push back, or Move). He plays those cards in the cities he passes while moving toward NY, trying to turn human settlements into dust while preparing for the final battle.<br/><br/>The other player commands the Outpost troops, attacking the convoy and trying to slow it down. The Outpost deck also contains 35 cards: soldiers (such as Runner or HG), buildings (such as Bunker or EMP Cannon), and many special cards (Move, Retreat, Medic). The Outpost has to win a few battles, slow down the march of Moloch as much as possible, and prepare to welcome robots in New York City.<br/><br/>",

Tiles are drawn and placed on squares on the board. As the tiles are placed islands develop on the board and players pay to place settlements, bases, or scouts on these islands in an effort to become the most powerful discoverer of all.

Since that time it has been condensing, collapsing upon itself.  It can now fit into the palm of your hand.<br/><br/>Our world&rsquo;s best minds must now find a way to contain and control the reactions of this alien artifact, or its exponentially increasing destructive power will remove our planet from existence, reconfiguring our space and time to the extra-dimensional needs of its creators. Can you and your team work together to shut down the Tesseract, or will humankind simply be a blip in the grand scheme of the universe? Time will tell.<br/><br/>Tesseract is a compelling, cooperative dice-manipulation game for 1 to 4 players. The focal point of the game is a block of 64 dice, the Tesseract, which sits at the center of the board on a raised platform. Players will remove cubes to place in their individual labs, transfer them as needed to others, adjust the cube's values and, importantly, isolate the cubes into the containment matrix, neutralizing them.<br/><br/>To Contain a cube a player must have in their lab 3 or more cubes all of one value (a Set) or in sequence (a Run), either all of one color or having none of the same colors. By filling the containment matrix completely (24 total unique dice) they will stop the reaction and win the game. But if the Tesseract has its last cube removed beforehand - or if 7 breaches occur, the game is lost and our world ceases to exist.<br/><br/>Asymetric character abilities include a passive, 'always on' ability and a unique action that is only available to that player. Research cards earned during play help give players an edge, as do the even more powerful Containment cards, unlocked from the matrix.<br/><br/>Tesseract is a very challenging co-op game, with lots of replay value built into the number of characters and various threat platforms which govern the difficulty. The game scales remarkably well and has a solo mode that is every bit as engaging. The tension mounts quickly as the Tesseract sheds cubes at the end of every player's turn, primes them and potentially causes Breaches to occur, bringing us closer to disaster.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Porto, the iconic city in the north of Portugal, is known worldwide for Port wine and the beauty of its historical center.<br/><br/>Porto is a fast-playing, competitive tile-laying game driven by card play. On your turn, you either draw cards or build floors. If you draw cards, the total value of the drawn cards cannot exceed 3. (Cards have values between 1 and 3.)<br/><br/>If you build floors, you MUST play two cards from your hand. The number of one of the cards determines exactly how many floors you will build, and the color of the other card determines the color of those same floors. Thus, with only three cards in hand, you have six different possibilities for building; with more cards, your options increase even more! Building gives you the possibility of scoring points but also opens new possibilities for your opponents because buildings do not belong to any player. You might start a building that can be completed by other players, and it is this risk management that makes Porto a very interactive game in which paying attention to the moves of your opponents is crucial.<br/><br/>Build floors, gain bonus points by completing houses or by constructing in the most crucial spaces, fulfill public contracts by building at crucial moments and by chaining combos to make a very profitable turn, shape the city so that it complies with your private contracts in order to maximize them at the end of the game, but above all, capitalize on opportunities opened by your opponents on the board. That said, in Porto any missed opportunity will lead to a new array of possibilities.<br/><br/>The game end is triggered at the end of the round in which a certain number of buildings have been completed. The player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

Both players hunt each other!<br/><br/>At first the forest lies peacefully under the face-down tiles. As the players turn the tiles over and move them on the board, the forest awakens and the hunt destroys the serenity of the forest. The lumberjacks cut swaths through the forest to provide hunting fields for the hunters. The bears then use these same aisles to track the hunters and lumberjacks. And both sides hunt the ducks who are just trying to live in peace!<br/><br/>The two sides are balanced with luck dominating the early game, but skill taking over at the end. Good hunting!<br/><br/>Originally published by Spear Spiele in 1973 as Jag und Schlag, Kosmos republished the game in 2000 as Tally Ho! / Halali! as part of its Kosmos two-player series.<br/><br/>",

The leader's abilities alter vastly the strategy and playability of every other card in the deck, making the game playable in 25 different ways.<br/><br/>In the game, players take turns placing cards and attacking. Each card can activate in various ways, taking on offensive capabilities in the front rows of the unit, or support powers in the back rows. Cards can also be played as orders &ndash; powerful single-time effects that can turn the tide of battle.<br/><br/>Play continues until either player's leader is defeated. A typical game is best of three or five rounds.<br/><br/>Pixel Tactics Deluxe is a perfect place to start playing the game. This large box contains enough cards for two players, rules, punch tokens, and storage space for all the other Pixel Tactics games in print. Whether you're a veteran of the series, or just looking to get your feet wet, it's a great place to start.<br/><br/>All 25 heroes in Pixel Tactics Deluxe are brand new!<br/><br/>",

One set of cards contains the beginnings of sentences, the second one the end of sentences. Each player uses two of these cards to create a first sentence to start the game. A game round ends when the papers are full.

Five building cards are placed face-up in the Great Works area and can be built by the players; any time a building is taken from this area, reveal another building card.<br/><br/>On a turn, you first move any card(s) played the previous turn to the forum, then you either Command or Plot. To Command, you play one card from your hand with the order you want to carry out or two identical cards, which allows you to take any order. The orders are:<br/><br/><br/>    Production: Place one card from the forum into your stock. For each Production activity you have, take the action again.<br/>    Exploration: Place one card from your hand into your stock. Repeat for each Exploration activity.<br/>    Draconians: Show one card from your hand, then move one card of this type from the forum to your stock; in addition, each player who commanded in his previous turn must give you a card of the same type from his hand, if possible. For each Draconians activity you have, you can show one more card, which lets you claim more from the forum and possibly more from opponents.<br/>    Trade: Transform one resource in your stock to an activity. Repeat for each Trade activity.<br/>    Construction: Start a new building (by discarding a matching color resource from the forum) or transfer a resource from your stock to a building in progress. Repeat for each Construction activity.<br/><br/><br/>When you complete a building, you gain its special ability for the remainder of the game. You can have only two activities, plus one more for each completed building you own. If you have more of a particular ability than anyone else, you claim the monopoly card for this activity, making each of these activities worth 1 victory point (VP) and allowing you to claim a matching resource whenever anyone completes a building of this color.<br/><br/>If you Plot instead of Command, you first copy one order showing in another player's area (if you have an activity of the same color), then you either draw until you have five cards or draw one card (if you already have at least five).<br/><br/>The game continues until one or more players hits a VP threshold (14-20 depending on the number of players). After completing the round (giving everyone the same number of turns), the player with the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>",

They try to prevent space contamination.<br/><br/>Solarius Mission is a very eclectic game &ndash; it is important to think ahead and to optimize the personal strategy. Who acts especially prudent, who will win in the end?<br/><br/>Solarius Mission is a tactical and strategic civilization game in a pulp science-fiction setting, with a dice-draft, dice manipulation, and resource-management mechanism. It can best be described as a mid-weight euro-style game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Perdition's Mouth: Abyssal Rift is a new kind of dungeon crawl, one that embraces the European school of game design with clever and elegant mechanisms and emphasizes strategy while minimizing luck. Cooperation, planning, and the enemy response deck eliminate the need for chucking dice, creating a tense combat environment with meaningful decisions! The rondels provide another tactical layer, including the enemy's devious and challenging AI.<br/><br/>The rules allow you to learn to play in 15 minutes, with a typical game round lasting less than ten minutes, even with up to six players, but deep, strategic cooperation will be required for your band of heroes to make it through to the Abyssal Rift and maybe even come out alive.<br/><br/>Perdition&rsquo;s Mouth is designed to be played as a story-supported campaign over several gaming sessions. In the campaign, you have to fight through at least six increasingly challenging scenarios and the level of success during each adventure has a direct effect on the rest of the story. Can you survive the labyrinth of the insectoid god?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Starship Troopers is based upon the popular novel of the same name written by the dean of Science-Fiction writers, Robert A. Heinlein. In the novel, Heinlein describes a futuristic war involving homo sapiens from our Earth (Terrans) against a Humanoid race (nicknamed the 'Skinnies' for obvious physical attributes) and their cobelligerents, the totally alien Arachnids. Since this is a story of future wars and future advances in technology, much is changed in the fields of weaponry and tactics and strategy. One thing remains the same, however; the fighting still rests on the shoulders of the individual infantryman. Although great starships has shuttle men between the distant solar systems and the power of individual weapons has risen to awesome heights, wars still cannot be won unless men venture onto the face of alien planets and fight the enemy on their home ground. As Juan Rico, the protagonist of the novel, relates:<br/><br/>&quot;We are the boys who go to a particular place, at H-Hour, occupy a designated terrain, stand on it, dig the enemy out of their holes, force them then and there to surrender or die. We're the bloody infantry, the doughboy, the duckfoot, the foot soldier who goes where the enemy is and takes him on in person.&quot;<br/><br/>Although the mission remains the same, future inventiveness has changed the method considerably. In a galaxy-wide war, manpower is at a premium. Platoons fight where entire armies once tred. But these platoons possess the firepower equivalence of a Twentieth-Century mechanized division. More importantly, each man in the platoon is provided with a piece of hardware that allows him to fight and survive in the holocausts of future combat&mdash;his powered armor suit. As Rico describes it:<br/><br/>&quot;A suit isn't a spacesuit &mdash; although it can serve as one. A suit is not a space ship but it can fly&mdash;a little . . . Suited up, you look like a big steel gorilla, armed with gorillasized weapons. But the suits are considerably stronger than a gorilla. If a Mobile Infantry man in a suit swapped hugs with a gorilla, the gorilla would be dead, crushed; the man and the suit wouldn't be mussed . . . The real genius in the design is that you don't have to control the suit, you just wear it, like your clothes, like skin . . . Even riding a bicycle demands an acquired skill, very different from walking. But a suit you just wear.&quot;<br/><br/>With the suit and the incredible array of weaponry that go with it, the Mobile Infantry soldier is an exceedingly formidable opponent. He had better be. The enemies he faces are the most awesome adversaries in the galaxy. Of the two extraterrestrial races fighting the Terrans, the Humanoids are the least revolting. Rico describes them as<br/><br/>&quot; . . . humanoid, eight or nine feet tall, much skinnier than we are and with a higher body temperature; they don't wear any clothes and they stand out in a set of 'snoopers' like a neon sign.&quot;<br/><br/>In early scenarios they are fighting on the side of the Arachnids.  In later scenarios, after successful negotiations with Earth, they switch over to the Terran side. They're only effective fighters within the confines of their small city terrain and strong points on the board.<br/><br/>But the 'Skinnies' were mild looking in comparison to the Arachnids:<br/><br/>&quot;The 'Bugs' are not like us. The Pseudo-Arachnids aren't even like spiders. They are arthropods who happen to look like a madman's concept of a giant, intelligent spider, but their organization, psychological and economic, is more like that of ants or termites; they are communal entities, the ultimate dictatorship of the hive . . . But don't make the mistake of thinking that they act purely from instinct . . . their actions are as intelligent as ours (stupid races don't build spaceships!) and were much better coordinated. It takes a minimum of a year to train a private to fight and to mesh his fighting with his mates; a Bug warrior is hatched able to do this ...&quot;<br/><br/>As the Arachnid Player, uses an Alien Control Pad sheet to record the placement of his underground central Hive cell complex and the attached tunnels radiating outward. Tunnels are used to move the Warrior units, along with Worker units mixed in as expendable decoys, to locations where they can pop up to the surface through a breach hole and attack the Terran units.  Completely unseen, and only paper recorded, Engineer units are used to create the breaches and, later, to extend the tunnels.<br/><br/>The game is set up in a &quot;Programmed Instruction&quot; system of scenarios to slowly introduce the game concepts. Scenarios range from Scenario I, which starts players off with a basic MI raid on a Skinny city (just like the book. &quot;Flores died on the way up&quot;) to Scenario VII, The Battle of Klendathu: the final Terran assault on the Arachnid Homeworld.<br/><br/>Warfare in the Twenty-second Century is the ultimate test of survivability of the human race. It was a very near thing.<br/><br/>Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 5<br/><br/>",

Each Wet Season turn, they simultaneously select 2 cards from their hand: 1 to immediately place into their personal landscape and 1 to place into a communal row of cards called the Dry Season row. Players then exchange their hands and repeat until all cards have been placed.<br/><br/>In the Dry Season, players take turns selecting 1 card from the Dry Season row and immediately placing it into their landscape. When the Dry Season row is empty, the game is over.<br/><br/>Players have an opportunity to score points during both seasons by fully enclosing their paddies with paths. They will score for the size of a &ldquo;closed&rdquo; paddy, which can be increased by adding houses, as well as for farmers (a player&rsquo;s family members) and buffaloes contained within the paddy. A player-specific &ldquo;ancestor,&rdquo; representing the guiding spirit of a revered forebear, will also award that player additional points for achieving certain conditions.<br/><br/>Strategically, opportunities abound in the card-rich Wet Season, when all share in a plenitude of resources and hands overflow with possibilities. Players must still think ahead to the Dry Season, though, when options will rapidly dwindle as the Dry Season row runs out of cards. The deck is micro and rounds are quick, but a sustainable plan for organically generating points is a must across the seasons.<br/><br/>In the end, the player with the most points wins and may proudly boast of having the most fertile rice paddies in the region!<br/><br/>",

To set up the main game, shuffle the double-sided cards, then give each player a similarly-sized stack. Players take turns revealing cards and placing them on the table, leaving all cards visible. As soon as someone spots matching cards, they place a finger on each card, then claim the pair, leaving them in a stack beside themselves. If another card of this type appears, anyone who fingers the twins claims all of those cards! Be the first to claim five twins to win.<br/><br/>You can also play Twin It! as a team game. When you spot twins, you place your finger on one of the cards and hope your teammate can finger the other before an opponent does, or else the opponent claims the twins instead of you!<br/><br/>Twin It! can also be played with the cards being held in hand facing away (and toward) each player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Since the beginning of time, two opposing forces have been the pillars of the universe and coexist in eternal balance. Our Goddess in her infinite wisdom has sent a group of Overseers to protect our world. They have the power to bend human traits to their will, and they will always battle between each other to create the perfect symmetry between virtues and vices of humankind. You will now choose whether to find the best balance &mdash; or completely crush it for your own good.<br/><br/>Overseers is a drafting and bluffing game with a twist. Each player represents an Overseer whose objective is to bend traits in their favor to create the most dominant combination of virtues and vices. The game has three main phases:<br/><br/>1] Drafting: Each player receives six cards at random from the deck, selects one of them, then passes the rest to the player sitting on their left. The goal is to build up the combination that will grant them the most victory points. Some cards grant points on their own, while others require the same type of cards to earn more points.<br/><br/>2] Judgement: All players place their five trait cards in front of them in two rows: two face down and three face up to show the cards they chose. Give the information available, the Overseers then discuss which player has the strongest possible combination. After deliberating, players vote for this person using their token. The chosen player must then admit or deny the verdict:<br/><br/>&mdash; If they admit having the strongest combination, they must then discard two cards from their combination.<br/>&mdash; If they deny this, the showdown phase happens, with all players revealing their scores. If the chosen player has the strongest combination, they lose the two cards that grant the most points; if not, instead they take one additional card of their choice from the discard pile.<br/><br/>3] Scoring: Each player shows all cards in front of them, then calculates their score.<br/><br/>The game might have other phases depending on the type of overseers being played as each character has special abilities that can change the outcome of the game, such as being able to peek at another player's hidden cards, steal a card before the scoring phase, or transform one card into another.<br/><br/>At the end of each round, players secret their victory point (VP) tokens to keep their score secret, and after three rounds whoever has the most VPs wins.<br/><br/>",

Players take control of the Allies or Central Powers fighting the war on land, at sea, and in the air all the while making tough economic and technological decisions at home.<br/><br/>Fields of Despair has a unique block system designed to maintain the fog of war throughout the entire game. In most games, block combat values range from one to four. In Fields of Despair the range is zero to twenty.<br/><br/>The range in values makes Fields of Despair a very deceptive game. Players can build up a large force with a single block instead of giving away their strategy with a stack of blocks.<br/><br/>Movement is simple and free flowing. Players are allowed to &ldquo;make change&rdquo; during the movement phase. Thus a block with a combat value of 16 could be broken in two blocks of 8 before moving, or conversely two blocks could be combined into one. Zero-value blocks known as &ldquo;Deception&rdquo; blocks could also be part of the exchange. Thus after every movement phase you never really know the strength of your enemy.<br/><br/>The fog of war isn&rsquo;t lost after first contact with the enemy. Blocks remain hidden even when enemies occupy the same hex and stay hidden until one player decides to allocate an air squadron for reconnaissance or sends his men across no man&rsquo;s land.<br/><br/>Components:<br/><br/>1 Mounted Board 22&quot; x 34&quot;<br/>1 Rule Book<br/>1 Playbook of Scenarios and Examples of Play<br/>2 Player Boards (to track Econ and Tech)<br/><br/>140 Blocks and Stickers<br/>- 48 Black<br/>- 49 Light Blue<br/>- 30 Tan<br/>- 10 Olive<br/>- 3 Orange<br/><br/>240 Counters<br/>- 162 5/8&rdquo; Counters (+14 blanks)<br/>- 18 1/2&quot; Counters<br/>- 60 1&rdquo; Counters (Air, Artillery, Tanks)<br/><br/>74 1/4&rdquo; wood cubes (Economic Points)<br/>- 30 Blue (Allied Naval/Production)<br/>- 30 Black (CP Naval/Production)<br/>- 12 Red (Eastern Front)<br/>- 2 White (Naval, no effect)<br/><br/>2 Bags for drawing Naval War and Eastern Front chits/cubes<br/><br/>Various Player Aids (Solo &amp; 2-Player)<br/><br/>",

It gets crowded on Ridback Mountain, and there are only so many dragon eggs to go around &mdash; not to mention that the dragons have started mixing exploding eggs into their nests, and those hurt.<br/><br/>In the fast-playing card game Eggs and Empires, players use matching decks of empire cards that contain adventurers numbered 1-10. Starting with a hand of three empire cards, each turn all players select one card from their hand, then play them simultaneously in an attempt to collect egg cards. Typically, the player who played the highest empire card chooses an egg first, then the player with the second highest empire card, and so on until all revealed eggs are collected, if possible. However, each empire card has a unique power that can affect the order in which eggs are selected. The powers interact in strategic and awesome ways so that every hand is exciting and fun!<br/><br/>Outwit your opponents to collect as many good eggs as possible &mdash; that is, ones worth victory points (VPs) &mdash; while avoiding those nasty exploding eggs!

        "description": "&quot;You're looking well, darling. One lump or two?&quot;<br/><br/>It's the most sought-after invitation of the year: Dinoton Abbey for high tea. Now you're all gussied up in your finery and ready for some tea and chit-chat. One problem: You can't remember anyone's name. Who's that, sporting the fancy brooch with her pet chicken? Is that Jeannine? Beatriz? Oh, dear. If you're not careful, you'll commit a faux pas everyone will be gossiping about.<br/><br/>Dinosaur Tea Party is a game of pure deduction for 3-5 homo sapiens. Each player takes a card corresponding to one of the dino guests. Players take turns asking each other questions or guessing their dinosaur's name. If someone guesses your name, draw a new card. The first player to guess three names wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.<br/><br/>On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.<br/><br/>Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.<br/><br/>If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.<br/><br/>To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.<br/><br/>If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.<br/><br/>Comment from the designer &quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface.&quot;<br/><br/>",

In this game, players colonize the galaxy using their ships, which they move on a modular board containing hexagonal spaces (systems). The modular board is made up of seven different double-sided sector tiles, which allows for a different map and different experience each time you play the game.<br/><br/>During a turn, a player must move one of their ships on the board. They can move the ship only in a straight line, as far away as they want, but they cannot go over systems controlled by other players. After moving the ship, the player has to choose whether to place a colony or a trade station in that system. Both of these mark control over the system until the end of the game, but the trade station gives the player bonus points for each adjacent system controlled by their opponents. The game ends when either all of the players have placed their colonies and trade stations on the board or until none of the players' ships can move (because they have become blocked by other players' systems).<br/><br/>After the game ends, points are calculated. Each player gets one point for each planet that they have in their systems. (Systems have 1 to 3 planets on the board.) Players also earn points for Nebulae; the more they have from one color, the more points they earn, with bonus points from other special systems such as the Unexplored System Tiles, which are part of a variant in the game. After calculating the points, the player with the most points wins!<br/><br/>",

Whichever team first places all eight of its tokens in the target area wins.<br/><br/>The first twist in Dog is that play is based on a hand of cards held by each player, with the start player and the quantity of cards cycling on successive hands from six cards to two, then resetting to five, then progressing back to two. Card values range from 1-13, with a number of special actions represented.<br/><br/>The second twist is that Dog is a partnership game, with the players winning or losing as a team, which adds a significant level of strategy and tactics to the game. Partners trade one card at the beginning of each round, and once one player from a partnership has completed his group, his plays now assist his partner.<br/><br/>Compact Dog is a travel version of Dog that's limited to four players instead of allowing for play with either four or six players, as in the full game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Battle for Germany game is small, it only takes about three to four hours to play for players of normal skill and luck. The game starts in December of 1944 with the Ardennes Offensive (a variant allows the German player to skip this and save his strength). As a two-player game, it is interesting in that each player plays both an Allied army (Western Allies or Soviet Union) AND a German army (Western Front or Eastern Front). This forces each player to play offense and defense. The player playing the Western Allies and Eastern Germans has a very challenging task. The Western Germans have good defensive terrain (the Rhine river and Westwall defenses), while the Eastern Germans have weak units, a long front, very poor defensive terrain and they face a large Soviet and Yugoslav army. The only real advantage enjoyed by the East German player is the lack of victory points to be gained in the East, and the slow Soviet replacement rate. The Western Alllied units are very fast moving, but they don't usually get a chance to exploit this until the very end of the game (at best).<br/><br/>The map is the same size as most SPI Quadrigames or folio games and has similar graphics. Cities are rated as 1 or 2 victory points, with Berlin worth 10. A line down the middle of Germany cannot be crossed (in the 2-player game), which makes Berlin the only city which can be captured by the Western Allies or the Soviets (ahistorical, but essential to the game's concept). Units are corps for the Germans and Western Allies and corps, armies, or fronts for the Soviet player. Each unit is rated for attack, defense and movement. Combat is decided by an odds-based combat results table and a die roll. Combat results include various combinations of retreat and elimination (there are no step losses, disruption or anything like this). Eliminated units can be replaced, but very slowly and (for some players) with the weakest available unit coming back first.<br/><br/>The game includes variants for 3- and 4-player versions where the Germans are played by 1 or 2 players, and a &quot;red star/ white star&quot; scenario where the Western Allies and Soviets fight it out with some help from the remnants of the German army.<br/><br/>Originally published in S&amp;T 50 - May/Jun 1975<br/><br/>",

They don&rsquo;t have to be correct! They just have to be the same as what other players think. Each round, players will roll the die to determine how many lowest scoring answers move down the player board. Then a question will be asked, and answers given and scored.

        "description": "Western Empires is a board game for 5 to 9 players and covers the development of ancient civilizations over 8000 years of history. Western Empires can take up to 12 hours to complete, and still yet, it has a simple mechanism and is easy to learn. The players lead their civilizations, as they expand and collapse, from the Stone Age, through the Bronze Age to the end of the Iron Age. Western Empires provides a full day of fun for larger groups.<br/><br/>Though it may seem at first glance, Western Empires is not a wargame. Yes, conflict may be involved, but rather it is a game about history, culture, trade, development, and... calamities. The civilizations involved are all situated around the Mediterrainean Sea. The Romans, The Egyptians, The Celts and The Minoans. Players develop their own unique civilization in arts, crafts, science, civics and religion. Each player starts his civilization with a single population token, 8000 BC, but grows and grows over time, and eventually cities can be built. Cities of course bring wealth and fortune, but also&hellip; natural calamities such as epidemics, famine or earthquakes, or civil calamities such as pirate attacks, slave revolts and civil disorder.<br/><br/>This wealth is expressed in trade cards. The more cities, the more cards a player gets. These cards provide both trading commodities, and calamities. Trading is the heart of the game. Develop religion, democracy, improve science&hellip; 51 different advances can be developed in five different categories.<br/><br/>Maybe a player can even construct a wonder of the world, or scatter their people all over the map, and gain cultural ascendancy. The player that knows best how to work together, trade or battle for territory, defend his people against nature or enemies like barbarian hordes, and stand the test of time, eventually will win the game. After up to 12 hours of playing that is. The game can be expanded with Western Empires: The Special Buildings Expansion (2019).<br/><br/>When combining the board games Western Empires (2019) and Eastern Empires (2021) this forms: Mega Empires (2021), an 18-player experience. A full game of Mega Empires takes up to 13 hours to complete. This bundle contains both stand alone games, each of which can be played by 3-9 players and can be expanded with the two Special Buildings Expansions (2019) for either game or the combination of both games. Where Western Empires has a focus on sea travel and trade on the Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Empires follows the Silk Road to India and trading is done through the deserts of the Arabian Peninsula.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designers<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tavarua is a 1-6 player competitive surfing board game. In Tavarua you are a surfer in a surf contest. You'll need to pick a board, paddle out, look for waves, and ride them in to score points!<br/><br/>Tavarua is played over a number of short rounds. In each round waves advance towards shore, players simultaneously select then resolve actions by playing cards, and a wave card is revealed and resolved. Rounds continue until there are no more wave cards in the wave deck, at which point the game ends and one player claims victory.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal of the game is to win the grand champion trophy, by having the highest scoring waves. You score points by catching and riding waves, but you may only keep your top two wave scores for each board type. General gameplay involves looking for a wave to ride, paddling to the wave, catching the wave, riding the wave, then scoring the wave. When the game ends, three trophies are given out, whoever gets the Grand Champion trophy wins!<br/><br/>Looking For a Wave<br/>At the start of each round all the wave tiles advance one space towards the shore. When looking for a wave to catch, you&rsquo;ll need to remember that you can only catch a broken wave. Waves are either unbroken, or broken. Waves with a die number less than their space in the break are unbroken. Waves with a die number equal to or higher than their space in the break are broken.<br/><br/>Paddling to a Wave<br/>Paddling moves your surfer in the channel. You can play any card to paddle, the number on the card determines how many spaces you move.<br/><br/>Catching a Wave<br/>You can only catch the wave that&rsquo;s in the same space in the break as your surfer is in the channel. To catch a wave, you&rsquo;ll need to play a card. The number and direction on the card will shift your balance. When catching a wave you&rsquo;ll want to look at the top card of the wave deck to determine which card to play. You want to play a card that will shift your balance so that you do not wipeout during the Wave / Score phase. You now move your surfer/surfboard onto the wave tile (standing your surfer up) and finally move your played card over to your score pile.<br/><br/>Riding a Wave<br/>Once you&rsquo;ve caught a wave you are considered to be riding it. While riding, your goal is to maintain your balance, while maximizing scored points. Cards you play will both shift your balance, and count as your score for the wave. The higher the number on the card, the more points it&rsquo;s worth, however the more difficult it will be to maintain your balance. After you play and shift your balance, a wave card will be revealed, and it too will shift your balance. Be careful: if your balance token moves one or more spaces off the nose or tail of your surfboard, you&rsquo;ll wipeout!<br/><br/>Scoring a Wave <br/>When riding a wave: cards played are not discarded, but placed into your score pile. The numbers on the cards determines the score value of that wave. When you stop riding a wave you will score it during the &ldquo;Wave / Score&rdquo; phase of that round. To score a wave take one of your color score tokens, with the board you&rsquo;re currently riding, and place it on score track at the number equal to your wave score point value, then discard all the cards/tokens in your score pile.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pacific War is a Strategic wargame that takes you from the attack on Pearl Harbor to the climatic summer of 1945&hellip; from Australia to China&hellip; from Burma to Hawaii&hellip; from the defense of Wake Island through the invasion of Guadalcanal culminating in the desperate battles to defend the Japanese Home Islands.<br/><br/>Players can become familiar with the layered Pacific War systems in the solitaire Engagement scenarios, then fight their way through increasingly panoramic Battle, Campaign, and Strategic two player and multi-player Scenarios. As they learn the game's basic maneuver and combat systems, they will then layer on more advanced systems for Strategic bombing, submarine attacks on merchant shipping, search and detection, amphibious assaults, and extensive Operations driven by their command decisions.<br/><br/>Pacific War is also a time machine back to the halcyon days of the monster game. However, despite what you may have heard, Pacific War is NOT a monster game, but rather an operational World War II air-land-sea game system that lets you fight EVERY Pacific battle and campaign of significance. The original game came with 21 scenarios. This new edition will add at least half a dozen more. The game gains its monster game reputation from the fact that in order to fight all of these campaigns, you need a large number of counters (over 2000) that represent individual capital ships, cruiser divisions, destroyer squadrons, aircraft groups, and land units ranging from battalions to divisions to corps, with all units individually rated based on their historic performance.<br/><br/>The game map is an equal area map (two mounted maps) which is the grandfather of the Empire of the Sun map. Each hex is 100 miles and covers the entire Pacific from Hawaii to India and Alaska to Australia. The game will also come with a separate map focused on the Solomon Islands where many of the interesting and balanced scenarios occur. What made Victory Games' Pacific War unique in 1985 remains true in GMT&rsquo;s 2020 edition. The design integrates strategic/operational intelligence into a telescoping time mechanic that allows campaigns to progress in a logical asymmetric flow, accompanied by tense game play. Pacific War is a deep historical simulation, so if this is not what you are looking for in a new purchase, please read no further. So, how is this level of simulation achieved?<br/><br/>During each monthly turn you bid command points (logistics) to determine initiative (offensive player), with the high bid then activating and launching their forces toward their objectives. Secretly,  your opponent (reaction player) determines the operational intelligence level and their potential to intercept the offensive. As the offensive develops, it comes within range of enemy air and submarine forces that tactically attempt to detect the oncoming attack. The reaction player decides how to defeat the attack based on the intersection of tactical and operational intelligence coupled with available forces and logistics.<br/><br/>This entire sequence is set within a telescoping time scale (days to hours) that has naval units seamlessly accelerate (from 12 to 30+ knots), searches seek out the enemy, carriers launch air strikes, combat air patrols defend, culminating with torpedo and dive bomber attacks on individual naval targets. At its core, Pacific War&rsquo;s game systems allows you to fight detailed carrier strikes (sequential and simultaneous) with night surface naval actions (float planes, gunfire and torpedo salvos) integrated with large scale ground offensives on the Asian mainland (e.g., Malaya, Burma, and China) and of course amphibious invasions (e.g., Java, Guadalcanal, and Leyte). If you are looking for a detailed and interactive operational simulation of the War in the Pacific, this is the game for you!<br/><br/>So, what will change in the new version? The structure and feel of the design will be unchanged, so if you played it in your youth, you already know how to play. That said, a devoted number of players have been playing this game for 35 years and I have incorporated the best of their feedback into this new and final edition for this title. I am going over each scenario and updating them with information that I did not have available back in 1985. For example, I now have several Japanese translations of their official records that were only published in the last few years. Toward this end, I am adding at least six new campaign and strategic scenarios, so you can experience the entire panorama of the war in a long afternoon .<br/><br/>The key question that I consider when buying a new game is will it hit the table? The owners and reviewers who created the game's reputation were excited that Pacific War had a layered set of scenarios that incorporated fifteen-minute solitaire learning engagements, two hour battles (such as Coral Sea and Santa Cruz that were used in a decade of tournaments), two to eight hour Campaigns (such as Malaya, Guadalcanal and Breaking the Bismarck barrier), and of course the Strategic scenarios that cover the entire war from a single year to the entire war. Will you ever play the entire war? It's unlikely (to date I have only done it three times). However, Pacific War is an operational level game and the Campaign scenarios are the heart and soul of this game system. Most play in an afternoon to completion. So, will it hit the table? Only you can answer that question, but from a time and learning perspective this game will support any time commitment you wish to make, to include the 100+ hour Strategic Scenario.<br/><br/>The other question that was not asked back in 1985, but to many is important in 2020 is &quot;does Pacific War have a solitaire &lsquo;Bot system?&quot; The answer is no, with an explanation. The only game decision that cannot reasonably be made is the Operations bidding mechanic and the original game included a solitaire bidding mechanic which will be retained. I will look to see if there are any other similar decisions, such as surface action range bids that I have already added. Thereafter, you will need to play both sides. Due to the history and the game system you will likely not notice as you experience the war&rsquo;s narrative unfold before you. So, although Pacific War will not have a &lsquo;Bot (not even sure how to do that with over 25 scenarios), the game will handle all the interactive bids decisions. If you want a full-blown solitaire opponent, this is not the game for you.<br/><br/>-description from publisher's website<br/><br/>GAME CONTENTS AS RECEIVED:<br/><br/>    2 Mounted Maps (22&quot;x 34&quot; each)<br/>    1 Paper map (17&quot;x 22&quot;), subset of mounted maps<br/>    10 coutersheets<br/>        2 sheets of 9/16&quot; counters, 384 total including 14 blanks - ships<br/>        8 sheets of 1/2&quot; counters, 2240 total including 12 blanks - everything else<br/>    <br/>    5 booklets<br/>        1 Core Rules Booklet, 68 pages, with index<br/>        1 Engagement Scenario Rules Booklet, 40 pages, subset of Core Rules Booklet with index<br/>        1 Battle Scenario Rules Booklet, 44 pages, subset of Core Rules Booklet with index<br/>        1 Scenario Booklet, with 34 scenarios - 8 engagement, 12 battle, 9 campaign, and 5 strategic scenarios, 72 pages<br/>        1 Battle of the Coral Sea (Extended Example of Play) Booklet, 16 pages<br/>    <br/>    13 displays<br/>        1 Operation Display (8.5&quot; x 22&quot;)<br/>        1 Allied Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)<br/>        1 Allied Force/Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)<br/>        2 Allied Force Displays (8.5&quot; x 11&quot; each)<br/>        1 Allied Screen (11&quot; x 34&quot;)<br/>        1 Allied Player Display (11&quot; x 34&quot;)<br/>        1 Japanese Force/Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)<br/>        2 Japanese Force Displays (8.5&quot; x 11&quot; each)<br/>        1 Japanese Task Force Display (8.5&quot; x 11&quot;)<br/>        1 Japanese Screen (11&quot; x 34&quot;)<br/>        1 Japanese Player Display (11&quot; x 34&quot;)<br/>    <br/>    1 Pad of Replacement Record Sheets<br/>    2 Ten Sided Dice (one orange, one blue)<br/><br/><br/>(all Booklets and Displays in Color)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Vampire: The Masquerade &ndash; Heritage, you play the role of an ancient vampire. You shape seven hundred years of vampiric and human history in pursuit of ancient secrets, while trying to evade the inquisition and attempting to save what's left of your humanity.<br/><br/>Heritage is a quick-playing legacy game. Each game, players gather characters from a common pool for their bloodlines. These characters influence different vampiric &quot;battlegrounds&quot; and help in fulfilling history-based missions. For example, a noble-born warrior might support Joan of Arc in ending the siege of Orleans, while at the same time changing the balance of an internal vampiric power struggle or attracting the unwanted attention of the inquisition. Aside from collecting characters in their bloodline, players can also use the unique intrigue cards of the clan they are playing &mdash; changing the rules of the game in ways that fit the character of that particular clan.<br/><br/>After any individual game, the players get to collect their achievements in their timeline, which serves as a chronicle of their actions throughout the seven hundred years of history and also influences the final outcome of the campaign.<br/><br/>Additionally, players may turn some mortals into vampires permanently by taking the cards out of their sleeves and turning them around, revealing their vampiric side and giving them new abilities and a name. These get put back in the common pool and can be additionally enhanced in future games. To allow for surprises when embracing mortals, all character cards come pre-sleeved!<br/><br/>In this fashion, players proceed through history as determined by the progression of historic mission cards, unlocking new challenges, characters, and rewards along the way.<br/><br/>Eventually, the seven hundred years will end with a climactic conclusion as players scramble to unravel ancient mysteries using the clues, allies, and power they have gathered throughout the campaign.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Endless wars are taking their toll as the people fall into despair. There is no hope for an end, no prospects for a peaceful order. The faith of the people slowly burns out. Dorment Spirits of the Nations wake up from centuries-long rest, rekindling the hearts of the people and raising ancient warriors called the Titans. People, filled with extraordinary powers, standing hand-by-hand with mighty Titans, fight to reclaim Europe. That war will end it all, and a King of Kings will be chosen.<br/><br/>In Titans players take roles of a king that leads an Army with a mythical Titan into Battle. There are 4 Nations to choose from, one of the European empires of that time - Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Russia, Sweden, and the Ottoman Empire.<br/><br/>The game revolves around a unique, yet simple Order Card Mechanics. Players will use a shared deck of Order Cards that will allow them to recruit Units, awake the Nation&rsquo;s Power and move their Armies across the Game Board. Players draw a specific number of Order Cards and place them face-up for all players to see. Players also see the upcoming Order Cards so they can plan their long=term strategy.  In his turn, the active player chooses 1 of the available Order Cards and uses it's available Actions. Players will try to gain strategic positions, move their front line and attack their opponents where they are the weakest. The next player uses the same Pool of Order Cards so the active player may try to anticipate opponents movement and use that to their advantage. When there is only 1 Order Card available it's discarded, the &quot;upcoming Order Cards&quot; become the available pool and new Order Cards are drawn. That allows for dynamic gameplay with a lot of planning, both tactical and strategical.<br/><br/>The game is divided into Rounds and the Round ends after the Order Deck is empty. After each Round players collect Victory Points for the Regions they control, so players constantly want to expand their domain. Winning Battles also bring players Victory Points so deciding when, where and how to attack is crucial as well. The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Being granted the status of a municipium brought a town into the Roman orbit and involved both duties to Rome and a gradual extension of the Roman citizenship to the inhabitants.<br/><br/>This game takes place in one of these municipalities in a western province.  The time is the middle of the 2nd Century AD, when the Empire had reached its greatest territorial extent and was enjoying its longest period of imperial peace.<br/><br/>Players are each in control of a powerful family and try to strategically place their family members in the various institutions throughout the municipium and gain the support of the citizens: Scholars, Merchants, Soldiers, and Priests.  At various times during the game, if a player has the most influence in an institution, the player can exert the power of that institution and gain the support of certain citizens.  Meanwhile, the praefect moves around the municipium and players strive to have the most influence in the institutions that he visits, thereby earning his favour.  Each of these institutions have unique powers, and players must decide how and when to use them.  The player best utilizing their power will become the most influential family in the municipium.<br/><br/>Municipium is #2 in the Valley Games Modern Line<br/><br/>",

The game proceeds simultaneously over three different periods. You start the game in the Middle Ages, on the first of the three game boards (that of the commanderies). With 4 action cards in hand per turn, you have seven turns in which to develop your domains by building various types of military, religious, and civil buildings. Depending on their size, certain buildings are moved in time, which means that they are transferred to the same place on the priories board (Renaissance period) and on the brotherhoods board (modern period), in ruins for military and religious buildings (castles, abbeys&hellip;).<br/><br/>Thanks to the watch makers' invention, and with enough money, you can make your two adventurer pawns travel in time&hellip; Because if the construction of certain buildings can be profitable, taking over domains on the various boards is essential, since it will allow you to earn bonuses on the 4th and 7th turns and to move ahead of your opponents.<br/><br/>Playing with time is not without consequences, and it can produce surprising results! To give just one example, an abbey created on the priories board could be destroyed by a castle built later in the game in the same place but on the commanderies board, and then moved to the other board&hellip; The abbey finally never existed!<br/><br/>On the 4th and 7th turns, each controlled domain generates profits for the players depending on the board. On the the commanderies board, a player who controls a domain militarily, i.e. the one with the biggest military building, will receive the value of the civil buildings in this domain in profits. On the priories board, it is the religious control that will be taken into account. On the brotherhoods board, the players who have best populated the civil buildings and restored the ruins will secure the best profits.<br/><br/>The possibility of destroying and regrouping buildings to unite or divide domains provides a strong and permanent level of interaction between the players.<br/><br/>",

The game is consistent with other games in the Grimpeur series in that it comes in a colorful small box and has modest components.<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Players all start with seed money, used to draft a team of racers. The racers come out in random order, and each have a unique power (mostly modifying movement rules, sometimes giving extra pre- or post- race abilities). The draft is as follows: shift any unbought racers down one step on the board (decreasing prices as they shift), then add a new card to the display. If all spaces full, must buy one. After players have their racers (a few will remain out of game), there will be 4 or 5 races. For each race, players secretly simultaneously choose a racer. Then, in turn order, simply roll d6 and move your racer. Of course, special powers modify movement throughout the race.<br/><br/>The first 2 finishers score VP (more VP in later races); most VP after all races wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.<br/><br/>Each turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.<br/>Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.<br/><br/>The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.<br/><br/>A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...<br/><br/>The Deluxe edition contains the basic Taluva game at increased size, as well as the following new expansions:<br/><br/>     Ship expansion: A new wooden piece, which can be placed in lagoons, adjacent to settlements<br/>     2-Hex tiles expansion<br/><br/><br/>",

Based on a variant of the Hammer of the Scots/Liberty system, Hellenes features good historical flavor, fast play, and lots of options for both players.<br/><br/>One player plays Sparta, the dominant land power of the era; the other plays Athens, the dominant sea power. Each side also seeks the allegiance of minor Greek city-states and barbarian tribes: some that persevere and others that come and go. Revolts, sieges, leaders, wintering, and civic discord all play important roles.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to erode enemy prestige to the point of Surrender by capturing cities, winning battles, and devastating enemy territory with raids. Walled cities are very strong in defense, leaving Siege as a common method of reduction. But if a Siege is broken by a relieving force, the lost battle reduces the besieger's prestige!<br/><br/>The map depicts Ancient Greece in the Aegean area, including the Peloponnese, continental Greece, Macedonia, Thrace and Ionia. A separate area on the map contains Sicily. Units include fleets, cavalry, archers, infantry and hoplites. Cards drive military actions and special events. Each card has both an Action value and an Event, and can be played for either purpose but not both. Actions include unit buildup, adding new units and group movement. Events include leader change, plague, barbarian uprisings, revolts, civil unrest, etc.<br/><br/>Hellenes includes 4 scenarios: The 431 BC Campaign (10 turns), The Sicily Campaign (5 turns), The 415 BC Campaign (12 turns), and The 413 BC Campaign (10 turns).  Each one plays in about 3-6 hours.<br/><br/>Designer: Craig Besinque<br/>Developer: Joel Toppen<br/><br/>",

The game is played in a series of multiple sessions throughout an epic campaign where you will take the role of hunters fighting monstrous creatures and unveiling mysteries about their origins.<br/><br/>In Campaign mode, players will choose their path through the story by completing quests and unlocking special rewards and achievements. Each mission you choose will lead to different developments of the story and to plenty of unique opportunities like crafting options, unique items and rare hunts to be played. The consequences of your actions will impact the story as the campaign progresses towards the epic finale. Players can also play one-shot encounters in the Hunt mode. Specific setup and rules are provided for single combat scenarios at different levels of gear and difficulty. The Hunt mode also offers the opportunity to play special end-game quests using your campaign characters.<br/><br/>The gameplay is centred on an intense and challenging boss-fight system that combines tactical positioning on the board, hand management and cooperative play. The combat is designed to be fast paced while focusing on card combos and player interaction. Each monster is a unique challenge that hunters will have to face as a group, completing specific objectives and adopting different strategies. Monsters have their own specific deck of cards which represents their specific combat behaviour including attacks targeting specific areas on the board, special abilities, but also weaknesses and vulnerabilities that hunters can take advantage of during combat.<br/><br/>The game also focuses on a deep character customization. As the campaign progresses, players will unlock a large variety of crafting options as they upgrade and expand the Forge depending on the specific monsters they slay. <br/>As the hunters level up from session to session, players will also have multiple choices to customize their deck of ability cards in order to build better synergies, card combos and group strategies.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Scopa is a traditional Italian card game (actually a family of card games that includes Scopone, Scopetta, and Scopone Scientifico) played in regions of Italy for over 400 years.  The game is played with a 40-card Italian deck (similar to a conventional deck minus either the 8s, 9s, and 10s or alternatively, the Js,  Qs, and Ks).  Four-player games are usually played in partnership; other numbers of players typically play for themselves.<br/><br/>In the original Scopa base game, four cards are turned face up on the table, and players are dealt hands of three cards.  On their turn, a player may capture any of the face-up cards on the table if the sum of the cards captured equals the value of the card played.  If a player cannot make a capture, they must discard a card face-up onto the table.  Cards are progressively handed out in lots of three until the deck is exhausted.<br/><br/>When the deck is exhausted, scoring is calculated.  Players earn 1 point for &quot;sweeping&quot; the table, that is, for clearing the table of all face-up cards; 1 point for capturing the most cards; 1 point for capturing the most cards of the coin suit; 1 point for capturing the 7 of coins (the &quot;settebello&quot;); and 1 point for the best &quot;primiera,&quot; that is, the best assemblage of high-value cards from each of the four suits.<br/><br/>The game is traditionally played until a player or team reaches a set number of points, usually 11 or 21.<br/> The name &quot;Scopa&quot; means &quot;sweep&quot; or &quot;broom&quot; in Italian, and refers to the action of picking up all face-up cards on the table.<br/><br/>In some ways, Scopa can be thought of as a precursor to many popular modern game designs.  The multiple competing goals and the limited hand-size make for a very modern-feeling game.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Gelb gewinnt!<br/>    Der Goldene Kompass: Das Kartenspiel zum Film<br/>    Shokoba<br/>    Templaria<br/>    Punto<br/>    Casino<br/>    Frog Juice<br/><br/><br/>",

The players lead their tribes in short, fast turns through the early history of humanity to the Bronze Age. They settle unknown lands and extract valuable resources through which they in turn discover new tools and inventions. Who will best prepare their tribe against events such as natural disasters? Who will take the lead, and who will follow in the footsteps?<br/><br/>Each turn, a player selects an action from the action display: grow, explore, or move. The first action is always free, while additional ones cost valuable shells. The used action moves to the end and the next player takes another action. It is important to use your scarce shells cleverly.<br/><br/>The players start with a small tribe with the immediately surrounding area explored. They discover new land and send the members of their tribe out to discover valuable resources. These resources are needed for new inventions that bring victory points and improve your actions: become better at exploration, grow more tribe members, and move further. Who will be the most tactical leader and guide their tribe to victory?<br/><br/>This is a completely reworked edition of the game Tribes: Early Civilization released in 2017 with many changes.<br/><br/>",

(Tasks include things like &quot;Take no tricks&quot;, &quot;Take 1 Trick&quot;, or &quot;Take No Red Cards&quot;.)  Then, all of the cards are dealt out in front of the players before each hand.  Row by row, the players draft cards, and the dealer declares who would have won each row's trick, if it had been played that way.  Players use this information to deduce what the trump number and suit are.  After all the cards are drafted, each player - except the dealer - selects one of the task tiles she drafted, which will be her mission for the hand.  The dealer is stuck trying to uniquely accomplish someone else's task for the round - but at least doesn't have to preselect which person's goal he is trying to &quot;steal&quot;.  The hand is then played in the traditional fashion, with each player trying to take tricks or not, based on the goal she selected.  The first player to complete five tasks wins the game.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Mü and Lots More<br/><br/><br/>",

You control one or more countries on either the Axis or Allied team and try to score as many victory points (VPs) for your team as you can through the use of cards or by occupying the starred supply spaces.

        "description": "Phantom Leader - Solitaire <br/><br/>Description:<br/>Phantom Leader places you in command of a US Air Force or US Navy Tactical Fighter squadron in Vietnam between 1964 and 1972. You must not only destroy the targets but you must also balance the delicate political repercussions of your attacks. If you strike too hard, your air offensive might be put on hold, strike too light, and you&rsquo;ll be blamed for losing the war.<br/><br/>Welcome to the Vietnam Air War!<br/><br/>Each of the campaigns can be played with either an Air Force or Navy squadron. The targets assigned to each service are different and change the complexion of the campaigns. Each campaign can be played with three different durations of: Skirmish, Conflict, or War.<br/><br/>Each mission takes roughly 30 minutes to set-up, plan, and resolve.<br/><br/>Each of your pilots has their own skills. Selecting the right pilots and weapons for a mission is vital to its success. As you fly missions, your pilots will gain experience and fatigue. With experience, their skills improve, but as their fatigue increases, their skills decrease and they might not be able to fly for several missions.<br/><br/>For those of you familiar with our modern era Hornet Leader series of games, you might be wondering what&rsquo;s different about Phantom Leader&hellip;<br/><br/>The freedom of being able to select the best mission based on military objectives is something that is commonplace for today&rsquo;s military. Back in Vietnam, the military was responsible for carrying out their orders, while at the same time being extremely limited in the weapons and tactics they were allowed to use to complete those orders. In many cases, the specific weapons, approach paths, and bombing altitudes were generated target-by-target at the White House. The mission specifics were then sent down the chain of command to the individual pilots flying the mission. As you can imagine, this was not the best way to run an air campaign.<br/><br/>Every target has a Political value. If you destroy it, you move the Political counter to the right a number of spaces equal to its value. As the counter gets moved to the right, your future target choices are reduced to those that are less politically sensitive. Which target you choose not to attack is also important. You get to move the Political counter to the left a number of spaces equal its Political value. [this last sentence is not in fact true for the game, though it appears in the game blurb; confirmed by the author]<br/><br/>This means that while you might like to flatten a big enemy target and rack up the victory points, it might be better for you to choose a pointless target and move the Political counter in your favor instead.<br/><br/>Another difference is in combat power. For the last couple decades, the US Air Force and Navy have enjoyed air superiority due to training and technology. Such was not the case in the skies over Vietnam. The enemy had different, but just as capable, equipment. They also had the training and will to use it to its utmost.<br/><br/>They soon became aware of the limitations placed on the US forces by the politicians, and used those limitations to their advantage.<br/><br/>For example, at times, US pilots were not permitted to fire on enemy aircraft until they were visually identified. This negated any range advantage conveyed by the radar-homing AIM-7 Sparrow missiles. It was also a common limitation that enemy aircraft could only be attacked in the air. US pilots were not allowed to attack enemy airbases. US aircraft were also limited to flying predictable flight paths, at set times. This made setting up ambushes much easier for the enemy.<br/><br/>So, while you might be a Hornet Leader ace, Vietnam is a whole different ballgame!<br/><br/>Components: <br/><br/>     110 Full color Cards <br/>         12 F-4 Phantom IIs (USAF) <br/>         8 F-105 Thunderchiefs (USAF)<br/>         2 F-105G Wild Weasels (USAF)<br/>         4 F-100 Super Sabers (USAF) <br/>         2 F-104A Starfighters (USAF)<br/>         1 EB-66 Destroyer (USAF)<br/>         8 F-4 Phantom IIs (USN) <br/>         6 A-4 Skyhawks (USN)<br/>         5 A-7 Corsair II (USN) <br/>         5 A-6 Intruders (USN) <br/>         4 F-8 Crusaders (USN)<br/>         1 EA-6A Electric Intruder (USN) <br/>         34 Targets <br/>         18 Special Events <br/>    <br/>     Full Color, 20-page Rulebook <br/>     Full Color Double-sided Counter Sheet (176 x 5/8&quot; counters) <br/>     6 Full Color Campaign Sheets <br/>         War in the South (1965) USAF &amp; USN<br/>         Rolling Thunder (1967) USAF &amp; USN<br/>         Linebacker (1972) USAF &amp; USN<br/>    <br/>     3 Full Color Player Aid Cards <br/>         Tactical Display<br/>         Card Diplay Sheet<br/>         Help Sheet<br/>    <br/>     1 Ten-sided die <br/>     1 Player Log master (to be photocopied prior to play)<br/><br/><br/>Other Leader series games by Dan Verssen<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/>    Phantom Leader: Deluxe Edition<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Castle Dice is a light dice-drafting game in which the players have been ordered by the king to build castles along the borders of the kingdom. The player who can create the greatest castle will become the new heir to the throne. Players will explore the land by rolling the dice, and then take turns gathering resources from them. These resources are then used to hire workers and improve castles. Players must gather and spend wisely as the Barbarians from the neighboring lands will attack players and steal their resources throughout the game. At the end of seven turns, the player who has built the greatest castle (earned the most victory points) wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Caucasus Campaign: The Russo-German War - July - November, 1942<br/><br/>In late July of 1942, Hitler sent two strong armies south across the Don to seize the fertile Kuban and the oil of the Caucasus. Germany's 17th Army and 1st Panzer Army steamrolled over all opposition until they reached the mountains. There the Russians slowed and then stopped the Germans at the outskirts of Novorossisk, on the road to Tuapse and along the Terek River. This infuriated Hitler who then took over personal command of Army Group A and poured replacements and reinforcements into the area that were badly needed at Stalingrad. Eventually 27 Axis divisions were fighting south of the Don.<br/><br/>The Axis forces include 2 mountain divisions, 2 light (j&auml;ger) divisions, an SS motorized division (Wiking), and 3 panzer divisions -- two of which had three tank battalions while many on the east front have only one. The German army is accompanied by 1 Slovakian and 7 Romanian divisions.<br/><br/>The ranks of the Soviet army in the Caucasus is filled with Armenians, Georgians, Azerbaijanis, Cossacks and Turkoman who have questionable loyalty. These divisions are reinforced by Soviet Guard and NKVD units sent across the Caspian, and by Soviet Naval troops stationed along the Black Sea.<br/><br/>The Caucasus Campaign is a quick playing, moderately complex game with large hexes and easy-viewing 5/8 counters. The game system is based on the classic Igo-Ugo/movement-combat-exploitation system, but modified with elements from Ardennes '44 (specifically: Determined Attacks and Defense and unit morale). The tournament scenario (6 turns) can be completely in roughly 2 hours. The full game is 14 turns long and can be finished in one sitting (approximately 5 hours).<br/><br/>Game Scale:<br/>Game Turn: 1 week<br/>Hex: 18 miles / 29 kilometers<br/>Units: Regiments to Divisions<br/><br/>Game Inventory:<br/>One 22 x 34&quot; full color map<br/>One &amp; 1/2 dual-side printed countersheets (264 5/8&quot; counters)<br/>One 24-page The Caucasus Campaign rulebook<br/>Two dual-side printed Player Aid cards<br/>Ten small plastic baggies<br/>One 6-sided dice<br/><br/>Solitaire Playability: High<br/>Complexity Level: Medium-High<br/>Players: 1 or more<br/>Playing Time: 3-6<br/><br/>",

        "description": "What a fuss. The frightfully fearsome feudal lord Fieso has held the fascinating fairy Fabula in captivity since the famous February festivities. In order to free the fairy must you redeem her from the Fieso's fetid and fusty feculent fetter. Frustrated you flee into the Finnish fjords in order to fetch a few of the fascinating fetishes so highly favored by the foul prince. Frantically you begin bartering with the local folks: a few Florins will get you some Fish which can be traded for Flowers, which again can be traded for Fur, Fruits, Flutes, Fettucine, Furniture, Fuel, Fiddles or maybe even a fridge. When your finances allow you to obtain 3 different fetishes you have won the game.<br/><br/>In Fische Fluppen Frikadellen, players are traders running (or sailing on a raft!) around a town, visiting various market stalls in order to buy, sell, or trade goods.  There are three different types of stalls in the game.  Merchants will sell you a specific good of the 5 base goods in the game according to current market prices, and will also buy a specific good from you, also according to market prices.  Traders will accept a specific good and give you two of a specific good in return.  Finally, there are dealer stalls which offer fetishes.  They each want specific combinations of goods, offering you a fetish in return.  There are three different fetishes in the game, and the first player to trade for all three fetishes wins!<br/><br/>Furthermore, whenever a player visits a market stall, a special ability of that stall activates.  These special abilities cause all sorts of game events, such as production of goods at merchants (you can't buy a good at a merchant if he doesn't have any available), price increases of goods, getting an extra turn or free commodity, changing the position of two merchants, etc.  Often times, players will need to utilize these special abilities to conquer their goals.<br/><br/>The really unique feature of Fische Fluppen Frikadellen is that there are three different versions of the game, so it can be played by up to 15 people on three different, interconnected tables!  You'll need one copy of the game for every 5 players.<br/><br/>At the start of a 15-player game, for example, there will be three boards, with 5 players at each board.  Each board is set up individually by the players starting there, and there are 36 merchants in the game with only 12 of them used per board, so it is very possible for each board to be significantly different than the others!  Furthermore, there will only be one of the three fetishes available at each board, so players will need to sail off to all three boards over the course of the game in order to win!  This means picking up all of your things and moving to a different table.<br/><br/>You aren't allowed to peek at the other tables before you move, which means it is a complete surprise what the market conditions and various stalls will be on the board that you move to.  This mechanic also means that there will not always be an equal amount of players at each board throughout the game, so players at boards with less players will likely get turns more frequently than players at boards with more players; another reason to leave your current board for a different one!<br/><br/>",

Knowing the Gauls had a relief force coming (of over 250,000 men), Caesar built a defensive perimeter facing outward to match his perimeter facing inward to beseige Vercingetorix.  An unusual &quot;donut&quot; formation.<br/><br/>The large mapboard 33&quot;x28&quot; portrays the town of Alesia and all of the works built by Caesar.  The Gauls have a small force trapped in the town including Vercingetorix as well as a large force which sets up in off board areas.  The Gallic player must reveal which off board zones he occupies with at least 1 unit, but does NOT have give further information.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is for the Gauls to create an escape route for Vercingetorix and exit him off the board.  The Romans must prevent this over the 20 game turns (which represents 2 days).<br/><br/>Originally self-published as Alesia in 1970, it was redesigned and reissued by Avalon Hill in 1976.<br/><br/>",

In Norse mythology, humans exist in the land of Midgard - a place in the center of the world tree and connected to the nine realms. Among these nine realms live gods and goddesses, serpents and spirits, and all manner of mythical and mystical creatures.<br/><br/>In Ragnarocks you take on the role of a Viking clan using Runestones to mark your clan&rsquo;s claims of land. In the advanced game, your clan worships one of these powerful beings from another realm who lends you their power to help you outwit rivals and claim territories for your clan.<br/>At the end of the game, the clan who controls the most territory in Midgard wins!<br/><br/>A player's turn consists of a move phase and a summoning phase.<br/>During the move phase you move one of your active Vikings any number of spaces in a straight line.<br/>During the summoning phase you summon a runestone and place it on any space along a path following a straight line from the location of the Viking you moved. Whenever a summoning creates an enclosed area containing only vikings of a single clan, that area becomes settles and belongs to the player whose clan occupies it.<br/><br/>When all vikings have settled, the player who controls the most territory wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Any means of overt or covert communication is allowed &mdash; a glance, a nod, pointing under the table, flashing a card, anything &ndash; but make sure you don't tip off the target or they could ambush you instead! In the end, one or two players will remain, either claiming all the gold or squaring off in a final showdown before starting the next round of play. The first player to score 24 points of gold wins.<br/><br/>Thematically, the inspiration for the game is one of the oldest pulp fiction/detective novel tropes: the Tontine, a financial investment that accrues, but pays out only to the last surviving member of the group. This practice is now largely illegal as it famously had the tendency to lead to murder.<br/><br/>But it is the subtle art of communication that delivers the fun of the game and you conspire with each other. If you are the target of the most votes, you're dead, and if you did not side with the popular vote, you are also dead, so you constantly have to stay informed or deceive your target to band together without letting the target know. Wink, smile, kill &mdash; that's the whole game. As soon as someone asks, &quot;Hey, wanna play Dead Last?&quot;, the game has already begun &mdash; and if you don't know who the target is, it very well could be you...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game of seafaring adventure in ancient Polynesia!<br/><br/>Tongiaki is a tile-laying game that reflects the risks and successes of these early explorers.  There is often a chance that an expedition will end in utter failure... or, it might land in Tahiti, Fiji, or Oahu.  Clever players might even found Royal Islands to call their own!  Only fate will decide if, and where, sailors make landfall, although careful planning will give players the best odds for ever seeing land again.  The goal of the game is to spread your &quot;tribe&quot; to many different islands in order to gain the most victory points.  Islands have victory point values from 2-5, and having multiple pawns on an island gives no bonus.<br/><br/>This game uses a unique tile design never seen in any other game (hexes with wavy edges), and is easy to explain and easy to enjoy.  Players all begin on the island of Tonga, and immediate overcrowding forces players to search out other islands to populate.  For each expedition that leaves, a new tile is placed, revealing either an island, or a &quot;water path&quot; that may or may not have a number from 2-4, indicating that many different players (not number of boats) must make up that expedition for it to survive the voyage (draw and place an additional tile).  In this way, the game encourages both cooperative and competitive play at the same time.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/><br/>300AD: The Polynesians embark on daring sailing trips and explore thousands of Pacific islands.  Driven by overpopulation and a desire for adventure, they set forth into the unknown on simple catamarans called Tongiakis.  Without any help from navigational instruments, they charted their course with the help of the sun, stars, wind and water temperature.  Birds, reefs, cloud formations, fishes and distinctive waves were the signals telling them that land lay nearby.  Each trip became a life-threatening journey, as landfall was often impossible to achieve or the way home became cut off by strong currents.  Suspense was their constant companion.  Will the next hour, the next day bring them to their goal...  Or will the ocean's currents force them to drift endlessly at sea?<br/><br/>Description from Uberplay's web site:<br/><br/>While originally designed to be somewhat cooperative, it can easily be played 'aggressively' in such a way as to rob other players of points and diminishing their presence on the board. The movement of pieces reaches a point where a 'triggered cascade' can alter the game drastically. Trying to foresee and select expansion moves leads to a weighty-er game than suggested at first glance.<br/><br/>",

To guide you, the Elders have created challenges that you can complete by painting on the wall of your cave.<br/><br/>Each round in Prehistories, you and your fellow tribe leaders bid simultaneously (and secretly) to decide who hunts where. The more hunters you have, the bigger the game you can catch, but the slower you are. The fastest player &mdash; that is, the one with the smallest sum of hunters &mdash; goes first, but they have few hunters with which to hunt. To hunt, you assign your hunters to one or more locations to catch the prey waiting there. Prey is represented by polyomino tiles, and the larger the tile, the higher the sum required. If you have just enough hunters to catch your prey, they might be wounded in the process, which means you'll draw fewer hunter cards at the end of the round to refill your hand. (They distrust your leadership when you get them injured!)<br/><br/>In the second phase of a round, you paint your cave with the animal tiles collected during the hunting phase. Your cave is represented by a 7x7 grid that starts with a few tiles already in place. The first tile you place goes in the left-hand column, and all subsequent tiles must touch tiles already placed, with all tiles being oriented so that the animals are viewed with their legs (or fins) down. (Cavemen have simple tastes and want everything to be representational.)<br/><br/>When you fulfill the wishes of the Elders by painting your cave in certain ways &mdash; such as completing a horizontal line or connecting opposing corners or surrounding a legendary animal on all sides &mdash; you place one or more totem tokens on that challenge. Whoever first discards their eight totem tokens wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Snow White, The Little Mermaid, Cinderella, and many other fairy tale princesses are celebrating a five-day party. The prince charmings, who have not been invited, will try to infiltrate the ball to propose marriage to the girls. As a princess, you have to avoid marriage proposals and remain single and independent after the celebrations.<br/><br/>Rebel Princess takes place over five rounds, representing the five days of a party, and each round has a special rule that makes each game totally different. The general mechanisms are those of trick-taking games, in which each player plays a numbered card into each trick, following one of the four suits in the game. The player with the highest number of the suit that started the trick takes all the cards of that trick &mdash; but that's not necessarily good as players want to avoid taking cards with prince charmings, who each bring one marriage proposal, aside from the enchanted frog who brings five proposals. The player with the fewest marriage proposals after five rounds wins.<br/><br/>Importantly, each player assumes the role of a different fairy tale princess and has a special ability that they can use once per round.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grimoire is the French word for &quot;spellbook&quot;, and smart use of your spellbook &ndash; more specifically, the spells within said book &ndash; will determine whether you succeed in this game.<br/><br/>Each turn in Grimoire starts by revealing several cards on the game board; each card has either a victory point (VP) value or is a character with a particular way to earn VPs at the end of the game. Once these cards are revealed, each player secretly chooses which spell to cast in his spellbook by placing a bookmark on the appropriate page. Everyone then reveals which spell they chose, with the spells going off in order from weakest (those with the lowest numbers) to strongest. Some weak spells nerf stronger ones, and the order in which players choose cards from the display can be flipped topsy-turvy depending on who plays which spells.<br/><br/>In the One Draw and Z-Man versions, the game ends as soon as one player has collected either ten character cards or ten treasure cards; in the Schmidt Spiele version, the game ends after a fixed number of rounds. All players then tally their points, and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Differences between the versions:<br/><br/><br/>    As noted above, the game ending conditions differ in the 2012 Schmidt Spiele version.<br/>    The Z-Man Games and Schmidt Spiele versions of Grimoire accommodate five players, while the original One Draw release allows only 2-4 players.<br/>    The Schmidt Spiele version contains four new character cards and two new treasure cards, includes hardcover books instead of softcover, changes two spells, and uses a more elaborate game board that depicts the spells and allows players to mark the spells chosen with small figures to track who has played what.<br/><br/><br/>",

From the Civil War through the 1920&rsquo;s, more meat was processed here than anywhere in the world. During its height, 40,000 mostly immigrant workers labored in &ldquo;the busiest square mile on earth&rdquo;, where over one million livestock passed monthly, supplying 80% of all U.S. meat. There were over 2,300 livestock pens and 130 miles of railroad within the &ldquo;yards&rdquo;.<br/><br/>You play one the &ldquo;Big Five&rdquo; meat packers, developing technologies to use every part of the animal while battling labor unions and manipulating the market to your advantage. Union Stockyards is played over six years (rounds), each beginning with an historical event affecting game conditions or adding an additional action. You select your actions through worker placement; however, if you don&rsquo;t pay your workers enough, they may go on &ldquo;strike&rdquo;. You earn cash based on your profit margins when you slaughter cattle, hogs, or sheep. Your profit margin is your meat value minus the livestock cost. The livestock cost is the same for all players, but your meat values will differ due to your engine-building decisions of constructing buildings, establishing branch houses in eastern cities, and improving your brand reputation. At the end of each year, livestock costs (cattle, hogs, sheep) will be adjusted up or down depending on the demand that you created. Sometimes you may choose to slaughter certain livestock just to manipulate the market in your favor. Whichever packer accumulates the most wealth wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Myth is a fully co-operative fantasy game. Players take on the role of one of 5 different heroes working together to defeat the Darkness. Each hero has a different skill set which represented by a unique deck of cards. Players spend Action Points by using cards. Once a certain amount of Action Points have been spent the Darkness fights back by activating monster lairs, spawning monster captains and eventually the Boss.<br/><br/>A complete game in Myth is called a Story. Each Story is played over three Acts. Acts can be played sequentially, or can be split up over three different game sessions.<br/><br/>Players' avatars within a Story are called Heroes. Myth Heroes are clothed in immense power, able to reave all but the mightiest foes. However, this power must be balanced lest the Darkness take too much notice. Players must weigh their actions against the Threat each will bring, with the consequences of awakening more evil and bringing doom on the party's endeavors. And be careful they must, as the Darkness is formidable and eager to snatch glory from the valiant.<br/><br/>Heroes are controlled through an intuitive Hero Deck (videos for each Hero can be found in the Game Play Videos section below). Each deck plays uniquely and allows players more freedom of action and the ability to truly impact the Story each and every Act. Yet, cooperation is the key to victory and bloody fortune. Players must communicate, interact, and assist each other or surely the Darkness will cover all.<br/><br/>Myth is a fully cooperative game. There is no player controlling the Darkness. The Darkness is governed by a set of rules unique to each Boss Deck and is activated through Hero actions. If the Heroes get overzealous, then the Darkness pushes back by activating Lairs, spawning Captains, and punishing the Heroes with devious Events. If the Heroes take a more subtle approach, then the Darkness reacts by reducing the potential for treasure and rewards. Without the treasures and equipment to upgrade, the Heroes will find each Act more difficult and eventually fail. The dynamic nature of the Darkness really lends a more fluid feel to the Story. Players aren't being driven by properties out of their control, nor are they being shepherded by a person whose skill has a direct impact on the enjoyment of the game.<br/><br/>Myth is a fun fantasy romp where players feel truly heroic. In the playing of the game, the players are creating their own mythos. These stories are the ones carried away from the table, becoming myths themselves.

        "description": "Card game with unusual scoring. Players play sets of animal cards trying to knock over each other's pyramids of buckets. Cards in hand can be used to attack and defend their colour buckets, taking out lower buckets causes cascades.<br/><br/>The deck is five colours (farm animals) numbered 1-8, with two 1s and two 8s. Players start with 12 cards.  The start player plays 1-3 cards of one colour, giving a total sum. This total attacks the player to their left, who either plays 1-3 cards of the same colour totalling higher to defend, or loses a bucket. If they do defend though, that total then attacks the player to their left and so on, round the table. If it gets back to the start player, then can add 1-3 more cards to their original play, increasing the total. At some point, a player cannot defend, and buckets go tumbling. If you match the total attacking you this reverses the direction of play, meaning the cards already played are being added to additional cards to create high totals.<br/><br/>Players look at their starting hand before building their pyramid o' buckets, so it pays to put your weak colours at the top.<br/><br/>If you play a cards or cards, you draw back only one card from the draw deck. If you forget, tough! The game ends when a pre-set number of players lose all their buckets, the number increases with the number playing. The player with the most remaining is the winner.<br/><br/>A game comes with enough buckets for 6 players, but you can play with multiple sets to allow larger groups to play. This works well as action down the far end of the table means you are safe, while the reversal mechanism means that there can be a build up of a lead to an unmatchable number before it breaks out of that end of the table.<br/><br/>Seemingly a game of luck, but noticable that the same players keep winning and with experience the winning margins keep getting reduced.<br/><br/>",

A small community has developed around the source, which seeks to protect this place and keep it as secret as possible.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some magical beings &mdash; half corporeal, half ethereal &mdash; have now tracked down this source. These beings of dubious character, which you call &quot;Djinn&quot;, have appeared in various places of the city to dispute your access to the source. You are young members of the Magic Guild, and to prove your abilities, you are tasked with capturing the Djinn so that they can do no harm. You can control them permanently only if you catch them in special Djinn bottles. To seal these bottles, you also need corks made from the bark of a tree near the magic source.<br/><br/>Whichever of you succeeds best in protecting your small town will be accepted into the inner circle of the Magic Guild and will soon be allowed to learn even more secrets...<br/><br/>In Djinn, you take turns moving across a map that shows thirteen locations. These locations are linked to actions where you can get the resources you need and catch the Djinn that are in six locations. In those locations you can do things like receive bottles and corks, collect magical power, buy magical items, hire mages to accompany you, discover secret passages, and more.<br/><br/>In each round, you can reach only one of two or three of the locations, so you must plan carefully to have all the resources you need in time to catch the Djinn.

        "description": "A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.<br/><br/>Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:<br/><br/>Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.<br/><br/><br/>Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; <br/><br/><br/>Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....<br/><br/><br/>In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings. Every time someone tries to build over a precious outhouse, the town votes! You try to enlist your supporters (represented by cards) to vote with you to stop or encourage the play of certain tiles-perhaps saving some of your buildings or taking out those of your dastardly opponents.<br/><br/>",

The game lasts eight rounds, with three cards being dealt to each player in the first round, four cards in the second, five in the third, and so on. Each card has one or two letters on it as well as a point value.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player draws the top card from the deck or discard pile, then discards a card. When a player is able to use all of the cards in his hand (with one left for discarding) to spell words &mdash; each of which must contain at least two cards &mdash; he may go out by placing the words on the table. Each other player takes one final turn, then plays as many cards as they can in words. Each player now scores, adding the point value for cards used in words, then subtracting points for any cards remaining in hand. In addition, the player with the most words and the player with the longest word each receive 10 bonus points; in case of a tie, no one receives the bonus. Whoever has the highest score after eight rounds wins!<br/><br/>Quiddler also includes rules for a solo variant.<br/><br/>",

If you do this before time runs out, you can grab one of the available scoring blocks, then move your token on the scoring track to the next such symbol on the track. Thus, the quicker you solve the puzzle, the more likely you are to grab a block that advances you the farthest.<br/><br/>Whenever you cross a red line on the scoring track, you must replace a colored block in your grid with a clear one, thereby making it more difficult for you to solve objective cards in future rounds.<br/><br/>",

Players work to improve themselves and become more desirable as potential wives for the available Suitors. The ladies do this by attending Events and improving their Characters, but advantage can be gained by the use of Cunning. All of their efforts are in hopes of securing the husband that will make them the most satisfied character at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Game play is divided into two stages: the initial Courtship Stage and the concluding Proposal Stage.<br/><br/>The Courtship Stage is when players try to improve their Heroine&rsquo;s chances of happiness by earning points playing Character Cards, and acquiring or playing Cunning Cards. Character Points help you to attract Suitors, and also count toward your total number of Character points at the end of the game.Cunning Points do not count towards your building your Character. However, the Heroine who has acquired the most Cunning will be the first player to enter the Proposal Stage later in the game, putting her at a significant advantage.<br/><br/>The Proposal Stage begins when Event Cards have been played. In this stage, players will roll to see which Suitor proposes to them, decide if they will marry them, and calculate their final score.<br/><br/>",

To expand to new territories or invade opponents, you need to unlock movement ability; to annex a territory, you have to outnumber the current occupant or have a &quot;sword&quot; result on the dice, with the inhabitants then fleeing elsewhere. The dice also allow you develop your player board by using the die face that corresponds to the improvement and controlling an associated territory.

        "description": "Quebec 1759 is a small, simple and short block board-wargame covering the conflict between the British and the French in Canada during the French and Indian War. The game comes with a gorgeous map drawn in the style of the period. Movement is conducted via a point-to-point system following the roads and towns in the area around Quebec. The game comes with handfuls of blocks to represent the British and French units.<br/><br/>This title uses Columbia Games Block system. While there are variations in the rule sets, all of their wargames are based on the block system. Basically this means that rather than using the traditional counters to represent units on the map the game uses wooden blocks that stand upright with unit details only shown on one side. This does two things:  First it provides an easy way of producing a &quot;fog of war&quot; because your opponent can not tell, save through good memory, what type of unit a specific piece is or its current strength. Second, having the blocks stand on end allows the possibility of rotating a block so the current strength is the top number. Although most war games have some type of mechanism that lets units take steps in their overall strength, counters normally have at most two steps because they only have two sides. Blocks, however, have four so you can easily keep track of twice the amount of detail that many other war games provide. With the use of blocks Columbia has provided a way of adding a good deal of depth to their war games without adding complex layers of bookkeeping, allowing interesting and relatively short sessions of play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From BoardgameNews.com:<br/><br/>As you can tell from the name, this game is an off-shoot of the 6 nimmt! family. The cards are numbered 1-100, and each card has a number of bullheads on it. Each player starts with ten cards in hand and is trying to discard those cards to win the round. The player who goes out scores zero points, while everyone else loses points equal to the number of bullheads on their cards.<br/><br/>Instead of playing cards on multiple rows, however, players play onto a single discard stack, with the played card being higher than the top card of the stack but not more than ten higher; if you can&rsquo;t (or don't want to) play a card within this ten point range, you have to pick up the discard pile. Ergo, &quot;11 takes&quot;. You then start two new stacks by revealing cards from the top of the deck. The number of piles keeps growing throughout the game.<br/><br/>Each time you take a stack with more than three cards, you get a bull card. With bull cards, you can play additional cards on your turn as long as all the cards fall within that ten point spread. For each bull card you can play on one different stack.<br/><br/>",

Seize power sources and capitals, develop your infrastructure, and build and wield vast, high-tech armies in your bid for global domination.<br/><br/>Players will probably recognize the map as that of Earth, but what they will not see are any borders or nations. In the world of Dust, the unending war and the new technologies have altered the political face of Earth beyond all recognition.<br/><br/>At the beginning of each turn, players select a card from their hand. This card represents their strategy for the coming turn and to a large extent dictates the actions a player can take.<br/><br/>During their production phase, players spend production points to buy additional factories and units. Each individual unit type has its own unique statistics and effects, so players have to carefully consider the composition of their armies.<br/><br/>In combat, players alternate rolling dice and destroying units until one side has been eliminated (either due to casualties or retreats) or a cease-fire is declared.<br/><br/>At the end of each game round, players score victory points for power sources, capitals, and majorities they control. The player who controls the most land areas earns bonus victory points, as does the player who controls the most sea areas and the player who controls the most production centers. The first player to amass a set number of victory points while also controlling a capital is the winner.<br/><br/>Only once a player has amassed at least half the victory points required to win can he or she attack an enemy capital. Once the war has been so escalated, however, then all players are free to attack capitals.<br/><br/>Dust English Rules Premium Version <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Dust/Dust_Rulebook_Prem_Eng.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Dust/Dust_Rule...</a><br/>Dust English Rules Epic Version <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Dust/Dust_Rulebook_Epic_Enig.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/ffg_content/Dust/Dust_Rule...</a><br/>Backstage <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.kaleidosgames.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.kaleidosgames.com</a><br/><br/>",

        "description": "User Summary<br/><br/>Now YOU enter the courtroom during five fateful days of July, 1885, when the future of a country hung in the balance, and the defendant, Louis Riel, faced hanging on a charge of treason.<br/><br/>From the publisher<br/><br/>Canada&rsquo;s westward expansion was very different than that of the United States. In the U.S., conflict in the westward movement was between the White Man and the Native Indian, and a common language united U.S. settlers. Language, however, has divided Canada ever since General Wolfe united the country by arms at the Plains of Abraham.<br/><br/>Canada&rsquo;s settlers pushed westward, led by fur-traders and trappers who were predominately French Catholic. These pioneers intermarried with the Native Indians, producing a new race and a new culture &ndash; the M&eacute;tis.<br/><br/>When the Canadian government made treaties with Native Indians, the M&eacute;tis, being neither Native nor White, did not receive any comparable consideration. Wanting to protect their rights against the remote Anglo-Protestant government in eastern Canada, resentment grew into rebellion in Manitoba's Red River Valley in 1869. Louis Riel led this resistance and forced the government into compromise, resulting in the Manitoba Act.<br/><br/>Due to his participation in the rebellion and in the execution of English Protestant, Thomas Scott, Riel himself was forced to flee to the United States. While residing there, Riel obtained American citizenship.<br/><br/>When trouble between the M&eacute;tis and the government occurred further west, in Saskatchewan, the M&eacute;tis recalled their former savior to lead them. Louis Riel and Gabriel Dumont, a local M&eacute;tis leader, initially worked toward a peaceful solution for their grievances. However, this movement eventually grew into a resistance, known as the North West Resistance. The Conservative government in Ottawa amassed a military force to crush it, and finally did at the Battle of Batoche, 9 &ndash; 12 May, 1885. While Gabriel Dumont fled to the United States after the battle; Louis Riel was tried and hanged for High Treason in Canada.<br/><br/>There are many reasons why the first Riel resistance succeeded and the second failed. The westward expansion of the railroad allowed the federal government to deploy superior forces rapidly to the field. Riel himself embraced unorthodox religious views &ndash; views that alienated the Catholic Church and its devout supporters who were the key to his first resistance&rsquo;s success.<br/><br/>",

Players will move their drill crews are at a rate of one per round (there are four rounds before Phase 2). Depending on the position of your vice president, if you deployed him to act in this phase, you can corrupt opposing drill crews (in order to attract them to the same tile as your active drill crew) or hire a subcontractor (to increase your drilling power).<br/><br/>Each tile of the earth's crust has a value indicating its resistance to drilling. If the sum of the drill crews who are present equals or exceeds this value, the tile is excavated and turned over; then draw an Extraction card to see what resources you discovered, which is evenly split between the players who participated in the drilling.

        "description": "Space mining is developing thanks to the cooperation between private corporations and governments around the world. Before the challenge to occupy another planet, however, we need to create a Moon base to extract resources from our natural satellite. Iron, titanium, water, and a powerful fuel, helium-3, are natural riches available in the Moon. To get these riches won't be easy; it'll require lots of work to install lunar probes, process extracted minerals, and ensure the working conditions of scientists and engineers in the crew.<br/><br/>In Luna Maris, you take on the role of a coordinator in charge of the lunar operations of a big company, organizing the crew, fulfilling demands, supplying worker's necessities, improving rooms in the complex, and respecting the strict environmental parameters. You start the game with six scientist cards, with which you can perform actions; to do so, place a scientist meeple in a room in the lunar complex, discard the appropriate scientist card, pay the activation cost (energy, water, oxygen, etc.), then receive the benefits of that room. The ten rooms each have their particularities and special rules:<br/><br/><br/>    Exploration Plant: Astronauts go out to the base to extract minerals.<br/>    Industrial Complex: Process extracted minerals. Also, control the air filters and decrease the CO2 emissions.<br/>    Greenhouse: Create food to sustain the crew members.<br/>    Expedition Area: Ship cargo to Earth and receive victory points.<br/>    Mining Room: Extract basalt and titanium to sustain a high level of production.<br/>    Communication Room: Hire better scientists and improve the human resources of the lunar base.<br/>    Power Plant: Juice the solar boards for an extra energy supply.<br/>    Recycling Plant: Recycle your waste to obtain resources in a green sustainable economy.<br/>    Laboratory: Use research to improve the Industrial Complex, Recycling Plant, and other facilities.<br/>    Dormitory: Take time off to recuperate.<br/><br/><br/>A game lasts five rounds, and during that time you can focus on installing lunar probes and producing raw resources; investing in the industrial complex to guarantee access to water and helium-3; hiring high-level scientists and optimizing your actions; or doing other things that will deliver victory points in the long run. After five rounds, players tally their scores to see who runs the base and who gets ejected into orbit. (Kidding!)<br/><br/>",

Each of up to four players or teams uses their own set, so there&rsquo;s no craning around to see the picture at the far end of the table. In fact, spiffy cardboard easels prop up the scenes nicely so they&rsquo;re easier to view.  Everyone loads identical scenes onto their easels and a deck of cards  provides a letter for the round. Everyone gets sixty seconds to write down as many things beginning with that letter as they can find in the scene. Although each word can be used only once - a football and baseball wouldn&rsquo;t count as two BALLS - an object can be used multiple times for different words (e.g., BASEBALL, BALL).  Once time has expired, players read through the lists. Any object on multiple lists scores one point for those who wrote it. Any item unique to a single list scores three points. When all lists have been scored everyone advances to the next scene and a new letter is chosen. The high score after all 12 scenes wins.<br/><br/>Re-implemented by:<br/><br/><br/>     Kaleidos Junior<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the middle of the nineteenth century and the age of steam is well underway. The Russian and Canadian governments, eager to capitalize on the new rail technology to bring together their vast countries, are sponsoring entrepreneurs to help build their railway networks. You are an investor, seeking to take advantage of their generous offer to make your fortune. However, your governments are not as benevolent as you first thought. They have begun to absorb fledgling rail companies, taking them away from those who worked so hard to build them by regulating impossible standards for new technology. You will have to remain diligent to ensure you are not next.<br/><br/>In 2005, Ian D. Wilson released 1861: Railways of the Russian Empire inspired by the railway development of Russia. In 2015, he released 1867: Railways of Canada, which is a standalone game that uses 1861's core rules on a different map with a handful of variations to gameplay. Both are classic examples of the versatile 18xx system of train games. They are straightforward enough to be your 1st 18xx game while still offering the depth you want in your 100th game.<br/><br/>1861 and 1867 are perfect as weeknight games as they can usually be played by experienced players in 3 hours. The games are staples at 18xx gaming conventions often as a palate cleanser after playing a longer title. What makes 1861/1867 in particular great entry points into the 18xx system is that the two games introduce the different game mechanics in phases. The beginning of a game only has Minor Companies running relatively simple operations and as the game progresses, new mechanisms like Merger Rounds and the National Railway are introduced. They are great games to learn, have a steady but ever increasing trajectory and speed, and pack enough of a wallop to keep players returning to them time and time again.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Godfather can help them avoid the police, but his protection comes at a cost. The game ends when the police complete their investigations into the counterfeiting industry, and the player with the most real (i.e., non-counterfeit) money wins!<br/><br/>The game is situated in Miami, Florida and lets players compete to be the best counterfeiter. Players assume the role of anthropomorphic figures and while being protected by the godfather, they try not to pay him too much for the offered protection. Meanwhile, the police is investigating the counterfeiting industry, quickly making lower quality counterfeited money useless.<br/><br/>Players each have three animal pawns and place them in turn order, immediately executing the associated action. Players can buy component cards on the black market, improving their opportunities for both printing fake money and processing it. Of course, players will exchange their fake money for real money and try to keep it away from the godfather by putting it away in an offshore account...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Purchased from France as part of the Louisiana Territory in 1803, the region was divided into square mile plots for the settlers from the east. In this game, players take the role of these settlers, developing the plots of land and establishing farms in America&rsquo;s &ldquo;Heartland.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The game, entitled &ldquo;Eine Frage der &Auml;hre&rdquo; in German, is a three-dimensional tile-laying game. Each tile contains two types of crops to be planted as well as a certain number of &ldquo;barnyard points.&rdquo; When placing tiles, players must always choose between scoring immediate &ldquo;harvest&rdquo; (victory) points or developing their farms through the barnyard points, which will provide victory points over the longer term. In addition, there is a race to the top of each barnyard point track in order to acquire the most valuable animals for the farm. Players may also &ldquo;rotate crops&rdquo; by using their tiles to cover up fields that bring their opponent&rsquo;s points, possibly expanding their own farms in the process. This translates into an hour-long game aimed at families and gamers with multiple paths to victory. <br/> Source: Jeffrey D. Allers<br/><br/>",

You take turns playing standard actions and cards from your hand to move your characters and attack opponents. If you knock out rival characters or occupy certain spaces near the center of the arena until your next turn, you score points. When a player reaches 20 points or runs out of cards in their deck, the game ends at the conclusion of that round, and whoever has the most points wins.<br/><br/>The rules for Disney Sorcerer's Arena: Epic Alliances Core Set are spread out across four chapters, with each chapter building on what's come before to introduce players to new skills, upgrades, and abilities over multiple games. Multiple expansions will be released for the game line to allow for more team combinations.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Claim victory in the Galactic Civil War in Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, a fast-paced card game for two players. In every game, you and your opponent match wits and resources over key events. If you can thwart your opponent, you claim the event, bringing you closer to victory. Whether you seek to triumph through military might, or use diplomacy to achieve your ends, the fate of the galaxy rests in your hands.<br/><br/>On one side of this galactic battleground are the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. Only rarely can these heroes go toe to toe with the unlimited reserves of the Imperial Navy and Army. Instead, the iconic characters of Star Wars and the unsung heroes of the Rebellion must work in secret, utilizing diplomacy, reconnaissance, and the Force to achieve their aims. Even when the Rebellion deploys its full military strength to win a battle or destroy a key Imperial emplacement, they need the groundwork put in place by Alliance Special Forces.<br/><br/>Opposing the heroic endeavors of the Rebel Alliance is the massive power of the Empire, led by the twisted Emperor. The dark side of the Force is strong with the Emperor and Darth Vader, and the military might of the Empire is unparalleled across the galaxy. Whether you undertake aggressive negotiations or hire bounty hunters and scum to ferret out Rebel spies, making the Empire the ultimate power in the galaxy rests in your hands.<br/><br/>To successfully win these struggles and reclaim the galaxy in Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, you will need to utilize all of your resources. Every turn, you can increase your faction&rsquo;s presence at the current event by drawing the top card from your deck and putting it into play. Each resource card you play give you more power and brings you closer to the objective value of the current event. As an example, the resource card shown to the right has a resource value of five, which it contributes to your total resource value while in play. Playing more resource cards may bring you closer to your target, but it also makes your efforts more obvious. If your total resource value ever passes the event&rsquo;s objective value, your forces are discovered and your opponent claims the event.<br/><br/>Instead of playing a new resource card, you can also trigger the power of a resource card currently in play, exercising the might of the Empire or the cunning of the Rebel Alliance. To activate a resource card&rsquo;s power, you must exhaust it by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. Once a card is exhausted, you can't use its power unless it becomes ready again. In addition, an exhausted card contributes its exhausted resource value, shown in the lower left-hand corner of the card while the resource is ready.<br/><br/>",

Evil Rhujas roaming the land want to capture the gemstones of the Inox. That's why the Inox have selected the hardest to reach and most dangerous place to hide their gemstones: the rock wall behind the Iquaz&uacute; waterfall. Their water dragon Silon blocks the waterfall so that the brave Inox can rappel down the rock wall behind it to place their gemstones there, out of harm's way. The gushing water and the dangerous water snakes at the bottom will stop the Rhujas from getting the gemstones. Which player in Iquazú will manage to use their cards skillfully and place their colored gemstones in the best spots?<br/><br/>Each turn in Iquaz&uacute;, players either draw four cards or play cards of a single color from their hand to place one of their gems in an empty space on the board the same color as the cards they played. If you place in the leftmost column, you play only one card, in the secondmost left column, two cards, and so on. The last player in turn order adds a water droplet to the highest empty spot in the leftmost column after their turn.<br/><br/>Once the leftmost column is full, players earn points based on how many gems they have in this column and they earn a bonus token if they have the most gems in a horizontal row. Bonus tokens can let you draw cards, ignore the color rule, earn points at the end of the game, and take another turn. Players then slide the waterfall right one column to make new bonuses appear and the leftmost gems disappear. Whoever holds the water droplet box passes it right. Players continue taking turns until the final column is filled, at which point players collect bonuses for the final time, then added any points collected to their score.<br/><br/>",

Its subject is the German Ardennes offensive Wacht Am Rhein (the Battle of the Bulge) on four detailed maps (at 1km per hex) and with 1,680 counters. Last Blitzkrieg covers the battle in a level of detail rarely seen before and does so in a very playable manner. The BCS itself was designed to show that battalion level combat is its own subject, being neither &quot;small divisions&quot; nor &quot;large platoons&quot;. The results may surprise some players, but will hopefully pique the interest of all and allow them to see many things they thought they already knew in a fresh light.<br/><br/>Key Battalion Combat Series concepts include:<br/><br/>    Objectives<br/>    Recon Units<br/>    Concentrated Armor and Support<br/>    Prepared Defense<br/>    MSRs and Combat Trains<br/>    Set Piece Combats vs. Shock Attacks vs. Engagements<br/>    Artillery Barrages<br/>    Artillery Asset Points<br/>    Attack by Fire<br/>    SNAFU<br/>    Activation by Formation<br/>    Traffic and Coordination<br/>    Fatigue<br/>    Memory Markers<br/><br/><br/>Last Blitzkrieg also adds:<br/><br/>    Bridge Blowing<br/>    Greif Teams<br/>    Weather<br/>    Tiger Maintenance Woes<br/>    Voraus Units<br/><br/><br/>Game play commences on 16 December 44 and ends on 31 December 44 (with each turn being one day) allowing the first phase of the Allied counterattack to proceed.

        "description": "You trudge along the dark, rocky coast seeking shelter from the raging storm. Drenched to the bone, you look up to see a brilliant beam of light pierce the curtains of rain. A lighthouse! But suddenly and inexplicably, the light goes out. You glance out into the water and spot a ship. It is heading straight for the cliffs! You realize that it is up to you to race to the top of the lighthouse and turn it on again before the ship crashes on the cliffs! But many puzzling obstacles stand in your way...<br/><br/>In Exit: The Game + Puzzle &ndash; The Deserted Lighthouse, there are riddles within riddles, hidden within four 88-piece jigsaw puzzles. Like other Exit titles, The Deserted Lighthouse has no game board, but it also has no riddle cards. Instead, there are four jigsaw puzzles that you will find and assemble, one at a time. Each completed puzzle reveals a location containing more riddles to decipher.<br/><br/>In EXIT The Game: The Deserted Lighthouse, you must work to solve the riddles and reach the lighthouse&rsquo;s top to activate its beacon, saving the approaching ship before it smashes against the rocks and sinks to the bottom of the sea.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, all you have available to you are the puzzle bag containing pieces with a grayish-blue back and no pattern, and the decoder disk. But there are also strange items to be found within the game that may be used to help solve the riddles found in each of the puzzles.<br/><br/>The game ends when you have solved the last riddle and reactivated the lighthouse beacon to save the ship from sinking.<br/><br/>Difficulty Level: 4 of 5.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Risk Godstorm the players are priests looking to lead their race (Greek, Celtic, Babylonian, Norse, and Egyptian) to dominate the ancient world and the Underworld as well. To do this they will need to marshall their forces, dominate continents, acquire relics of power and call their Gods to earth.<br/><br/>Risk Godstorm uses the basic combat elements of classic Risk but alters many other elements. The game is played on an ancient map of the world that focuses on Europe and Northern Africa. Atlantis is also present and highly desirable however a chaotic event can see the fabled city sink into oblivion, taking all the forces present there with it.<br/><br/>At its core the players are trying to control territories and controlling entire continents earns the players bonus units to deploy and further their cause.<br/><br/>One of the key differences to classic Risk is that the Underworld can be invaded and defeated units can also be sent to the Underworld to fight again, with some proving themselves worthy enough to return to the Earth.<br/><br/>As in the play of Risk 2210 A.D., Risk Godstorm is played over 5 rounds (called Epochs here). At the end of that time frame the player with the most Victory Points is declared the winner. Victory Points are earned for the number of territories controlled + region bonuses + control of crypts and altars in the Underworld and for every relic that offers a territory bonus if that territory is controlled.<br/><br/>Also like Risk 2210 A.D., the game begins with a number of territories out of play. Here they are called Plague Lands.<br/><br/>Risk Godstorm also allows players to play Classic Risk using the Risk Godstorm board for an alternate experience.<br/><br/>",

It was extremely fashionable in the 1950's, threatening for a while to displace Contract Bridge as the premier card game.<br/><br/>The rules were standardized in North America around 1950 and it was this version of the game that gained worldwide popularity. In many countries, Canasta is still played in more or less its original form, sometimes alongside a number of variations. In North America, however, the game of Canasta has continued to develop, and the version now favored by many American players, called Modern American Canasta, is very different from the classic game.<br/><br/>Canasta is generally agreed to be best for four players, playing in partnerships. However, there are playable versions for two, three or six players.<br/><br/>Canasta is a standard deck playing card game modified by adding two decks together and adding all four Jokers.<br/><br/>",

Wheels creak and reins pull as racers drive their horses forward in a panic.<br/><br/>You are a charioteer in the Circus Maximus, the greatest raceway in the ancient world.<br/><br/>A crescendo of noise builds with each lap. Chariots collide, whips crack. The crowd cheers for a surprising breakaway, rumbles as a favorite is damaged and falls behind. From the imperial box, the emperor laughs and shouts. Clouds of dust obscure the bright banners of the four factions.<br/> Three hundred thousand fans are on their feet as you turn the final corner. This is not the finish they expected. You lead by a length, and only one rival remains; each throws the last of their energy into one final sprint. Many thousands are despondent, other thousands exultant and joyous. Their shouts become a roar, a long scream, as you surge for the finish line. Another hundred yards will make you a hero.<br/><br/><br/>Charioteer is a new game from Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan author Matt Calkins. Like Matt's previous games, Charioteer features simple rules, quick play, and novel mechanisms.<br/><br/>Charioteer is a strategic racing game that plays in one hour. Each player controls a chariot in the Circus Maximus of ancient Rome. There's lots of action, and it happens quickly, with simultaneous move selection.<br/><br/>Movement is determined by melding sets from a hand of cards. Every card does more than one thing, and it takes multiple matching cards to make a move. Choosing to use a card in one set means deciding not to use it in another. Timing when to make a critical move is as important as knowing what move to make.<br/><br/>Moves come in four colors, and each has a special advantage. Play a red move to attack your opponents, yellow to recover from disruption, black to turn a sharp corner, and green to sprint.<br/><br/>Each racer begins the game with different abilities, and they improve their skills as the race progresses, leading to big bonuses in their favorite types of moves. Show the emperor the kind of move he prefers, and a racer's skills will increase even faster.<br/><br/>Players deploy tokens to give their moves a special bonus. More tokens can be earned by impressing the crowd with large matching card plays. Players may choose to delay using their best sets until they're big enough to qualify for a fan token.<br/><br/>Some races will be violent and others calm, depending upon whether the players and emperor behave disruptively. Attacks cause damage, which reduces movement speed. Players who specialize in recovery moves may overcome damage quickly. Others may need to carefully deploy their shields on turns when violence is expected.<br/><br/>It's not always clear who's winning the race. Being in front of the pack may not be as important as developing a critical skill, collecting powerful tokens, or keeping damage low. Whip icons allow those who have fallen behind to surge back into competition.<br/><br/>Charioteer is easy to learn. It can be played by bright kids as well as adults. Despite its accessibility, it is a game of skill.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game provides pre-drawn spell sets for use in the early rounds, but soon players start drawing spells randomly or create their own spell combinations that are common to all players. Each spell combination gives an effect that lasts the rest of the game, and the more ingenious the combination, the more powerful the effect. As the rounds progress, the game becomes a different experience every time, with more than 2,100 spell combinations being possible.<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as a magician's grimoire is complete or a familiar is fully fed, then the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>SpellBook includes a solo mode that closely mirrors the multiplayer experience, offering a high level of challenge and an excellent way to learn the game's rules.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The board consists of an array of hexagonal spaces with ice floes (hexagonal plastic tiles) that are introduced at the top and can be moved down the board by players with rates dependent on where they are on the board.  On their turn players must first move, rotate or introduce a new ice floe, then they can move one of their explorer as far as they can (or want) before collecting an item from the tile they finished on.  When moving, explorers are limited by the obstacles they must overcome and the tools they have available.  For example, the ice floes have smooth sides and rough side: the rough sides depict &quot;pack ice&quot; which is hard to cross, and costs a rope.  Similarly, explorers can swim up to one space, but that costs a fish as swimming through arctic waters is energy sapping.  Polar bears are also a hazard that must be avoided or lured away with fish; beware they can be lured away from one player straight into the path of another!<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to negotiate all the hazards and arrive in Siberia with his three explorers intact.<br/><br/>Not to be confused with:  IceFloe<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Lost Legends is a fantasy card game by Mike Elliott that combines a streamlined Euro game design and card drafting with an interesting fantasy theme and battle mechanic.  Players take on the role of heroes trying to assemble an arsenal of equipment in order to vanquish a series of monsters that they will encounter.<br/><br/>The game begins with all players choosing one of five heroes each with their own strengths and weaknesses. Each player fights their own monster; this is not a cooperative game. The monster each hero will likely face is revealed to them before players draft cards for their equipment.  An interesting aspect in this game is you may, if the conditions are right, evade a monster in front of you, and pass it to the hero next to you. But be aware if you do this you have to fight the monster you draw next!<br/><br/>Players then select an equipment card drafted from a hand of cards, and pass the remainder of the hand to your left to prepare for battle with the monster in front of them. The equipment draft continues in this manner until only one card is left in each hand, which is discarded.  Players then compare their drafted equipment to their monster to determine the result of the battle!  The game consists of 3 levels filled with monsters to slay and new equipment to pick up.<br/><br/>Players need Legend Points to win the game! These come in the form of trophies awarded for most monsters as well as sets of monsters slain. Can you defeat the monsters thrown in your path to glory and become the most Legendary?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cartagena takes as its theme the famous 1672 pirate-led jailbreak from the fortress of Cartagena. Each player has a group of six pirates, and you want to be the first to have all six escape through the tortuous underground passage that connects the fortress to the port, where a sloop is waiting for them.<br/><br/>To move a pirate, you need to play a card from your hand. Each card bears one of six symbols (gun, rum, parrot, etc.), and when you play a card, you move one of your pirates forward to the next matching symbol in the tunnel, leapfrogging over matching symbols where another pirate already stands. The only way to get more cards, however, is to move backwards; more specifically, you move one of your pirates backwards to the first space that holds one or two pirates, drawing one or two cards after doing so. Each turn, you take 1-3 actions, whether moving forward or backward or both. When you move a pirate to the end of the track, it jumps on the sloop where it must await the other pirates in its crew. With every step toward victory, though, you have fewer and fewer pirates to move each turn, possibly locking you in to actions you don't want, so be sure to plan ahead and not leave yourself empty-handed!<br/><br/>This version of Cartagena includes the classic base game mixed with Cartagena 2. The Pirate's Nest and several new variants. The game includes eight double-sided game boards, and to play the base game you use only six of them. Use more boards for a longer game, or fewer boards (and possibly fewer pirates) for a shorter game. To replicate Cartagena 2, you can flip over three or more of the game boards to create a secondary path that's separate from the first one. Now when you place pirates in the sloop, you can use an action to move the sloop to the start of the second path &mdash; and with two paths, you have a harder time making huge jumps from start to finish.<br/><br/>&quot;Morgan&quot; is a variant in which players can now draw cards by moving an opponent's pirate ahead, drawing one or two cards when the pirate stops at the first space that contains one or two pirates; this variant and all others can be used in any version of the game. With the &quot;Filibusters&quot; variant, whenever someone plays one of the twelve cards with a dark background, everyone other than the active player must discard until they have at most seven cards in hand.<br/><br/>Finally, the &quot;Black Magic Woman&quot; variant introduces special powers to the six symbols on the card, and when you play a card, you can use it for pirate movement like normal or use the card' power. You can play two parrots as if they were any other symbol, or use a lantern to look at the top four cards and keep one of your choice. With the gun, you steal a card of your choice from an opponent's hand, with them getting one free draw in return. The treasure chest symbol lets you pick up the treasure chest from the space where you stand, most likely drawing cards from the deck as a bonus, but possibly suffering a snakebite that will have you running back for rum to help you forget the pain!<br/><br/>",

The game is played in a sequence of turns, with each turn allowing a player to perform 1 Main Action and any number of Free Actions. As a Main Action, a player will usually place a worker on an Action Space.<br/><br/>The workers (collectively known as Vassals) come in two types: Spearmen &ndash; young warriors of each house, and Dragonriders &ndash; noble warriors and hunters gifted with their own Simurgh steed. On their turn, each player will place one of their Vassals on an empty Action Space to gain resources, exchange their assets for Power Points, add new Vassals to their house or breed a new type of Simurgh.<br/><br/>During the game, players will collectively build the board by drawing and placing Action Tiles, each either providing new Action Spaces (some allowing any Vassals, some exclusively the Dragonriders), or creating an opportunity to score points for combinations of specific dragons in a player&rsquo;s possession. When all the scoring spaces are filled with tiles, the game ends at the end of the round and Power Points are tallied.<br/><br/>",

Go up against heavily-armed enemies with your hot cars, daring driving, and jaw-dropping vehicle-to-vehicle leaps of faith. Whether you are taking down a swerving semi filled with valuable cargo, stopping a rampaging tank in its tracks, or bringing down a high-tech helicopter as it rains fire from the skies, you&rsquo;ll have to work together to take advantage of every team member&rsquo;s strengths.<br/><br/>Each of the three scenarios is different and impacts how you and your high-stakes seeking team will strategize to win!<br/><br/>On players' turns, they will move, leap from vehicle to vehicle, fight back enemies, and pull off crazy stunts (that also act as the timer for the game - run out of stunts to do and you lose the scenario). You'll accomplish this by passing dice skill checks which your variable player powers and vehicles' stats will impact.

This re-development has new rules that open entirely new options of strategy: big leaps with the aid of golden colored clover tiles, repositioning a pawn any distance backwards with the aid of spiral tiles, thus being able to gather more wishing stones, and also the new leaf clover tiles, and Oracle tiles, which allow for more point bonuses.<br/><br/>A player now has the ability to move back and forth, when on specific fields. There are new bonuses, for instance when the three pawns of a player form a specific formation, or when a new figurine, the oracle lady, is moved. Because a player can choose to move any of his three pawns in a turn, the game offers more flexibility - but this also requires more planning.<br/><br/>",

During the collection phase, as the active player you draw cards one at a time, keeping one for yourself, placing one in an auction pile, and placing the others face up for the other players to draft. Once you take a card, you can't take another, so sometimes it's a tough call to decide when you want to take something. Once you've had multiple collection phases, the cards in the auction pile will be auctioned one by one.<br/><br/>Some cards are worth points depending on their color, some are worth gold, and some allowing you to manipulate the value of the various colors. Once all the cards have been auctioned, players reveal their hands and tally their points to see who wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player, armed with a fistful of dice, starts his turn by rolling 5 dice and placing as many of them as possible on a card, though you must always place at least one if you can.  Each card has 6 rows, with from 1 to six dice pictured in each row.  These are in various combinations, and dice must be placed in order in each row.  As long as you place at least one die, and you have not used all of your 5 dice, you can then choose to roll again.  If you choose to stop, or you roll dice with no legal placement available, your turn is over.<br/><br/>Scoring is achieved by placing the last die in a row and scoring can be a negative.  When the last row of a card is scored it is removed and a new card replaces it.

        "description": "Ascension is a deck-building game in which players spend Runes to acquire more powerful cards for their deck. It offers a dynamic play experience where players have to react and adjust their strategy accordingly. Each player starts with a small deck of cards, and uses those cards to acquire more and better cards for their deck, with the goal of earning the most Honor Points by gaining cards and defeating monsters.<br/><br/>Ascension: Gift of the Elements is the eleventh standalone game in the Ascension series, although the game can be combined with other titles for play with up to six players. This set sees the return of Events from Storm of Souls and Immortal Heroes; Events enter the game via the center deck and create an immediate impact for all players. However, unlike in previous sets, Events can now be acquired and transformed into powerful Hero cards.<br/><br/>This set introduces two new mechanisms: infest and empower. Infest allows you to mess with an opponent's deck, forcing them to draw useless cards. This gameplay feature can slow down a player that jumps out early and introduces a strategic element not seen in previous sets. Players can counter this infestation through Empower cards. When the player acquires an Empower card, they may banish a card played that turn (i.e., using the card, then eliminating it). This added flexibility creates a lasting impact in each game.<br/><br/>",

During his turn a player can extend an aqueduct, close an aqueduct and earn points for closed aqueducts.<br/><br/>To extend an aqueduct, the player chooses a worker and the corresponding architect, play the corresponding tile, move the workers forward and move the architect ahead.<br/><br/>An aqueduct is closed when it ends at the side of the gameboard or a non-fitting neighboring tile.<br/><br/>A closed aqueduct yields 1 point for every tile it is long. If an aqueduct crosses a tile for the second time, it yields two points.<br/><br/>The game ends when no tile can be played for an entire round. Winner is the player with the most points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Alea:<br/><br/>The game is about Jakob Fugger, who was probably the wealthiest man of his time. &ldquo;Jakob the Rich,&rdquo; as he was named in his time, owned so much money that he loaned money to a host of counts and kings. Often, they were not able to repay him in cash, so they awarded him special privileges, such as trade rights and offices.<br/><br/>2 to 5 players ages 12 and up assume the role of the merchants from Augsburg and try to get what they can -- by means of auctions -- from the nobility, thus increasing their wealth and particularly their social status.<br/><br/>The game play uses a simple bidding mechanism. Each round, players offer cards of varying values in a series of five auctions. Once a bid is made, players either raise the bid, call, or drop. The winning player may choose from a set of possible actions that increase abilities (and more importantly, points).  After a number of rounds (dependent on the number of players), scores are tallied. It's that simple.<br/><br/>This is a game by Karsten Hartwig, whose other game &ldquo;Chinatown&rdquo; was already published by Alea. Game length varies -- depending on the number of players -- between 25 to 90 minutes. The difficulty level is a 4 on the Alea 1-10 scale (the same as Ra).<br/><br/>Besides the players&rsquo; tableaus and a game board, there are 90 game cards and various game chits.<br/><br/>This game is #3 in the Alea medium box series.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Art Decko, first released as Promenade, is a light strategy game for 2 to 4 painting collectors in which you try to create a valuable deck of gold and painting cards over the course of play. These cards &mdash; gold and paintings &mdash; both count as currencies in the game, and you can use them to purchase more paintings, acquire more gold, and pay for exhibition space in a museum. Your long-term goal is to manipulate the market value of certain styles of artwork, while also earning points by placing paintings in the museum.<br/><br/>The game includes paintings from five styles of art &mdash; Art Nouveau, Pop Art, Renaissance, Surrealism, and Impressionism &mdash; and you start with five random painting cards in your deck. Each art style starts with a value of 1 gold for a painting. You also have five starting gold cards in your deck, with the cards being worth 1 or 2 gold, with some cards having a special ability on them.<br/><br/>To start the game, shuffle your deck, then take five cards in hand. Fill the four galleries with 2-3 random paintings each, then place two random 3-gold cards (each with a special power) in the bank, along with the deck of 5-gold cards. Paintings in galleries cost 1-8 gold, while gold cards cost 5 or 8 gold. On a turn, take two actions from these three choices, repeating an action, if desired:<br/><br/>&bull; Haggle: Discard a card from your hand to draw two cards from your deck.<br/>&bull; Acquire: Pay the acquisition cost of a painting or gold card by discarding cards from your hand, then place that card in your discard pile. Increase the &quot;market rating&quot; of the painting's art style or gold by the value listed in the gallery/bank. As the market rating of an art style increases, each painting in that style is worth more gold, effectively increasing its buying power; that art style is also worth more points at game's end.<br/>&bull; Exhibit: Pay the exhibition cost for a gallery, then place a painting into that gallery that matches one of that gallery's invitation markers. (A gallery might want, for example, 2 Impressionistic paintings, 1 Renaissance painting, and 1 painting of any type.) Mark that painting with one of your ownership tokens, then place the related invitation marker on the highest available victory point (VP) space, scoring those points for yourself immediately. That painting is now removed from your deck.<br/><br/>If you use the special ability on a gold card instead of its listed numerical value, remove that card from the game.<br/><br/>At the end of your turn, discard any number of cards from your hand, then refill your hand to five cards. If a gallery has no paintings in it, refill all of the galleries with 2-3 paintings, then replace each empty gallery's cost token with the next highest one available. When at least twelve paintings are in the museum, the painting deck is empty, or an art style or gold reaches a market rating of 70, finish the round, then proceed to final scoring.<br/><br/>The value of gold depends on its market rating, with its value ratio ranging from 6:1 to 1:1. Each painting in your deck is worth 1-7 VPs depending on the market rating of its art style. Each exhibition space in the museum also has a random bonus that was revealed at the start of play, and you can earn additional points through these bonuses. In the end, the player with most VPs wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player is a race that has the ability to bend or break certain rules in the game.  You will use force, cunning, and diplomacy to win success for your unique form of alien intelligence.  Battles are determined through the use of cards in addition to assistance from other players around the table.  The winner(s) will be the first player(s) to have FIVE COLONIES on any planets outside his or her home system.<br/><br/>This is an updated version of the original Cosmic Encounter (1977).<br/><br/>Major differences between this version and the Eon version:<br/><br/><br/>     Terminology was changed for many components and rules: Compromise to Negotiate; Consolation to Compensation; Edicts to Artifacts, etc.<br/>     Both the Eon version and Mayfair Games' version used tokens to represent players' forces.  Avalon Hill changed them to plastic ships, and changed the system pieces as well, and the Hyperspace Cone became a Ship carrier.<br/>     Mayfair's version used cardback art similar to Eon's, so the two could theoretically be combined.  Avalon Hill used all new art on the cards, and the stock is much thinner.<br/><br/><br/>",

Pick carefully; the spells you choose will allow you to counter your opponent, twist the fabric of time, and deal devastating damage, but only if you&rsquo;re able to find synergies between spells and manage your mana reserves carefully.<br/><br/>In this two player strategy card game, you must fulfill your destiny and become the Keeper of the Grimoire. Defeat your opponent by drafting new spells from the magical Grimoire, casting them, managing your cooldowns, and dealing massive damage.<br/><br/>Each turn, draft one new spell to be added to your spell repertoire. But be warned! Your opponent has access to the same spells as you do, so choose the spells you want before your opponent does! Continue updating your spell repertoire throughout the game to optimize your deck and counter your opponent.<br/><br/>Cast spells. Deal devastating damage or confuse and trip up your opponent. More expensive spells will have a larger impact on the game, but be careful, they&rsquo;ll cost you more mana and will have a longer cool down. You can cast as many spells as you like on your turn so long as you have enough mana and the spells aren&rsquo;t in cooldown.

        "description": "Trick-taking card game for three in which players must sacrifice cards from their hands to bid the number of tricks they will take.  It uses a standard deck of cards, shorted to 6 through Ace in each suit, plus one Joker. (A more recent version of play omits the joker.)<br/><br/>To bid, lay aside three cards from your hand; the suit of those cards determines how many tricks you must take (each club is three tricks, heart two tricks, spade one trick, diamond zero tricks). Score one point per trick you take plus a bonus if you make your bid exactly.<br/><br/>For an additional bonus, you may offer to declare by turning your bidcards face up at start of play, thus declaring your target and revealing more information about the lie of cards.<br/><br/>For a higher bonus, you may also offer to reveal. This involves not only turning your bid-cards up but also then playing with your hand of cards exposed on the table before the opening lead.<br/><br/>While designed for three players, the four-player version is faithful to the original but played with a standard 52-card deck. Two- and five-player variants also exists, but they employ a dummy hand and a 500 deck, respectively.<br/><br/>",

The Silver Dragon is laid on the table as the starting card; at this stage it is a wild card. The playing cards feature domino-like colored panels in the same manner as Aquarius, an earlier game design from Andy Looney.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he draws one card and plays one from his hand. Cards are laid so as to connect matching colored panels. The deck also includes Action Cards such as Move a Card, Zap a Card, Trade Hands, etc. The used Action Cards form a discard pile, and the top card of this pile dictates the color of the starting Silver Dragon; once the discard pile has started, the Silver Dragon is no longer wild.<br/><br/>The first player to create a connected territory of seven panels matching her dragon color wins.<br/><br/>Reimplements<br/><br/><br/>     Aquarius (released in 1998)<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "It is the late Republican period of Rome, and you are the leader of one of the factions in the city, competing for power in the Senate. You are increasing your wealth by buying up resources, then using your position to sell them to the state for fat profits. With the resulting cash, you then &quot;buy&quot; more Senators, controlling yet more votes in the Senate. Rome is constantly in conflict, and you know that at some point wars will increase to the point that the Senate will choose to centralize power and appoint a single leader. At that moment, the leader of the faction with the most Senators will be made Caesar.<br/><br/>Senators is best described as an adversarial bidding game. Players earn money by purchasing resources at auction, extorting them from other players, then selling them in sets to the bank. Cash is required to support wars, defend against aggressive bids, and most importantly to buy more Senators. The game lasts a variable number of turns, and when the fourth war is revealed it immediately ends. At that point, the player with the most Senators wins.<br/><br/>On their turn, a player first draws an event card from the deck, then takes one of three actions: a) launching an auction by putting new cards up for sale, b) extorting cards from other players, or c) cashing in sets of cards and buying new Senators. The game is simple, relatively short, and highly interactive. The key decisions are both tactical &mdash; how to value the cards at auction and how to bid for the wars, deficits, and other events given your relative position &mdash; and strategic: choosing which Senators to collect and how long to build sets versus when to cash in and buy Senators.<br/><br/>Everyone is transacting all the time, and the game integrates different bidding systems including an open step bid (like many worker placement games) at the market auctions, blind bidding at the wars, an innovative high/low blind bid at the budget deficits, dutch auctions when new Senators arrive, and shotgun offers (similar to Kuhhandel or Medici v Strozzi) when players extort from each other.<br/><br/>",

Now, the two candidates must battle for control of the planets to determine who deserves the right to become a Certified Civilization.<br/><br/>Cosmic Encounter Duel is a competitive standalone two-player game in the Cosmic Encounter universe in which you and your closest frenemy race to be the first to control five planets. Each of twenty-seven alien species comes equipped with its own unique abilities that play with the game mechanisms in some way, offering you an edge in the fight, e.g., the Cheater, who can reserve an additional tactic that they can put toward any fight in the game &mdash; as long as their opponent doesn't call out how they're trying to &quot;cheat&quot;. How your game of Cosmic Encounter Duel plays out will inevitably be affected by which powers each dueling species has and how they play off of one another.<br/><br/>In addition to your unique species and its ability, you have twenty spaceships to traverse the cosmos and maintain control over the five planets you need to become a Certified Civilization. As long as you have a ship on a planet, you have control of it, even if your opponent also has ships there and you must share control. You can deploy these ships to fight in duels, use them to act as reinforcements, or draw them back for a tactful retreat. Just don't lose them to the Warp or let them be claimed by the black void between the stars and end up lost in space forever!<br/><br/>To play, players draw and resolve Destiny cards, which come in three types: Discovery cards, Event cards, and Refresh cards. Discovery cards have you and your opponent discover a planet and duel for control, while Event cards ask you both to test your mettle against a variety of challenges and cosmic calamities, and Refresh cards offer a respite in which you can recover ships, gather allies, and ultimately prepare for another clash.<br/><br/>At the start of a duel, you and your opponent secretly decide how many ships to send to the planet, and once they have been deployed, you can call upon any befriended envoys. To plan your attack, you secretly choose a card from your hand and a standing tactic from your collection to either guard your ships or blast your opponent's ships, then you fight, sending ships to face-off for control of the planet until the winner claims their prize while the loser retreats. After you and your opponent resolve a Destiny card, you check the icon on the bottom of the card to determine which deck to draw from next, then the race continues.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player controls a cloned clan of lemmings that have been specially trained to compete with the other lemming clans, all trying to scurry down a canyon and hurl themselves over a cliff. Distance and style points are important. One lemming diving with style and &eacute;lan is worth as many as five of the more mundane divers. But beware the hungry eagles circling overhead or your lemmings might not even make the cliff edge!<br/><br/>Objective: The player with the most victory points wins the game. To earn victory points, players dive their lemmings over the cliff edge and/or collect Lemming Chow Pellets.<br/><br/>The game board is a hex-based map representing the canyon down which up to six separate lemming clans will travel. The canyon ends with the cliff edge hexes, which are the lemmings' ultimate goal. Between the lemmings and their goal there are two eagles circling overhead hoping for multiple lemming snacks.<br/><br/>Each turn a movement card is revealed which will allow for 2-5 lemming movement points. Card luck is mitigated in that all players use the same card to move that turn. Only the top lemming in each stack is allowed to move, so covering your opponents' lemmings is one tactic that is used to slow them down. The down side is that the top lemming in each stack is the only one in danger of becoming eagle chow.<br/><br/>Special Actions allow players to briefly alter the normal rules of the game to their advantage or to their opponents' detriment. There are 16 different Special Actions in the game.<br/><br/>Home Page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gmtgames.com/p-143-leaping-lemmings.aspx\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.gmtgames.com/p-143-leaping-lemmings.aspx</a><br/><br/>",

And other enhancements for the mines that need to get developed further during the game to have full effect.<br/><br/>4 different gems are the currencies in this game. However, when collecting income you draw cards from 4 different mines (card stacks) with each having its own distribution! The number of gems you earn depends on the upgrade level of your dwarves. Gems are used to either win new objects for their mine through simultaneous 4-way auctions, or to enhance their mines, objects, and victory point count. Another innovative part is that each object has to be upgraded to fully use its benefits, e.g. a level 1 dwarf only gives you 1 income per round, some level 3 dwarves give you 3 income.<br/><br/>On the King's way through the mountain, the requirements for upgrading some special cards always change, and only the player who wins the sapphire auction knows where the next turn will lead to. There are shorter and longer paths to the Coronation Chamber, where the game ends. The game lasts between 10 to 12 rounds.<br/><br/>",

Trouble is, you can't SPEND the stack on a ship until your next turn, by which time somebody else may have taken it away from you by the same process.<br/><br/>Scoring in Die Safeknacker was very streamlined and elegant:  You scored the value of the card when you took it and paid off the other players the values of their chips in your stack.  In this new version there are complications (tokens to collect, a consolation prize for the player next to the top in the stack) which give you a little more to think about.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/><br/>     Die Safeknacker<br/><br/><br/>",

Each player controls a number of guests at a party, with the number of guests dependent on the number of players. These guests start the round in the spaces of the gallery on the game board, one guest per space; this initial placement is a large part of a player's strategy.<br/><br/>The Phantom (or &quot;Hugo the ghost&quot; in earlier versions) starts in the cellar, then climbs the stairs towards the gallery where the guests circle. The mechanism for the Phantom's movement is simple: On a player's turn, he rolls a special die. If he gets a number, he moves his pieces; if he gets a Phantom, the Phantom moves. This means that with more players in the game, the Phantom moves a lot more frequently, so you must adjust your strategy accordingly.<br/><br/>Once the Phantom has reached the gallery, the guests can start ducking into rooms adjoining the gallery to avoid him, with only one guest per room! A couple of rooms are special in that they add or subtract extra &quot;fright points&quot; from your score. As the Phantom catches up with the remaining guests, they are sequestered on the stair steps, then in the cellar. The first guest caught &quot;earns&quot; the most fright points, with those caught later in the round earning less and less.<br/><br/>Once all the guests have been caught, the fright points are tallied. After playing a predetermined number of rounds, the player with the fewest fright points wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Beowulf: The Movie Board Game is a reimplementation of Reiner Knizia's Kingdoms. It's also not to be confused with the same author's Beowulf: The Legend. It's an abstract strategy clothed in a theme based on the movie directed by Robert Zemeckis. The players' goal is to score the most victory points by clever tile and figurine placement on the board, composed of squares arranged in a grid. Its layout is changed, as the game is divided into three chapters that feature slightly different sets of tiles that can be drawn. Clever hand management (of tiles and figurines) is also important in the game, as some of them can be used only once throughout the entire game. Gameplay is as follows:<br/><br/>1. On his or her turn, a player may either place a tile (which can be a negative or a positive number, feature a special power or not) or a figurine on the board. If the player wishes to place a tile, he/she can add one to his/her hand of two and place one of the three tiles. Special powers of these tiles may be: displace a figurine, swap a tile from the board from the one from a player's hand, block other tiles, increase the power of figurines in the same row/column, cancel positive numbers on tiles, swap two tiles on the board.<br/><br/>2. By placing tiles and figurines, players will form rows and columns. After the board is full, the value of each figurine is calculated. Each figurine has a value of 1-4. This value is multiplied by the sum of values of all tiles from tiles that are in its row and column. Special powers of tiles may apply here (like the increasing of figurines' power or blocking). Players evaluate all their figurines on the board and gain points equal to their value.<br/><br/>This game differs considerably from its predecessor (not all of these may apply to the third English edition by Fantasy Flight Games released in 2012):<br/><br/>1. In Kingdoms, all three acts took place on the same board. Here, the board is two-sided, with three varying grids.<br/>2. There are more positive tiles than negative ones in this game, therefore situations when players lose points for their figurines are much less frequent.<br/>3. Here, a player manages a hand of three tiles. In Kingdoms, the players had no hand. Instead, he/she drew a single tile which had to be placed on the board.<br/>4. There are more tiles with special powers. More tiles can be swapped, even figurines can change their position, which didn't happen in Kingdoms.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spheres of Influence: Struggle for Global Supremacy is a 2-8 player free-for-all light wargame, set on a modern world map. Players will take control of one of the games 8 mighty factions as they compete over the world's spheres of influence, capitals and oil reserves. Will a mighty caliphate rise to power? Will the communist curtain once again fall? Or will western democracy sweep the world?<br/><br/>In games with fewer than 5 players, each player will control 1-4 factions simultaneously, coordinating their efforts against the other players' coalitions. Each faction will begin the game with only a single, semi-randomly determined territory under its control. From this one space, factions will aggressively expand.<br/><br/>The gameplay of Spheres of Influence is divided into a set number of rounds, with each round being split into 2 phases: the mobilization phase and the turn phase. During the mobilization phase, factions take turns placing units based on how powerful they are. During this phase, the global turn deck is also formed. This deck will be used to determine the turn order and frequency of action for each faction during the upcoming turn phase. To form it, each faction contributes a number of their turn cards (based on the number of oil fields they control) to a single, shared deck of turn cards. This deck is then shuffled and place down on the table.<br/><br/>During the turn phase, one at a time the top card of the turn deck is revealed. Whichever faction's card was just flipped, that faction takes a turn, performing a single action with its units on a single space (moving, attacking, annexing or passing). Once that action is complete, that turn ends and the next turn card is revealed, with the process repeating itself. This makes turns both fast (with many turns lasting only a couple of seconds) and suspenseful, since none of the factions know precisely when their turns will be. It also ensures more incremental game developments - factions cannot sweep across all of Asia in a single turn and players can respond to attacks or betrayals much sooner. Once the last turn card in the global turn deck has been revealed, a round ends and another round begins.<br/><br/>Combat is resolved by a simple dice mechanic fused with a &quot;situational&quot; modifier that loosely simulates the increased difficulty of attacking a defended coastline, breaking a naval blockade, or striking a fortified position. Along the way, powerful special cards can be played, allowing players to strike with submarines, deploy heavy armor, paradrop troops around enemy defenses, and launch devastating nuclear attacks.<br/><br/>Games have either 5 or 6 rounds depending on the number of factions. Once the final round is complete, the faction who controls the most spheres of influence wins the game for its owner. Games typically last about an hour and a half, and experienced players can sometimes finish in just a single hour.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Family Business takes mob warfare to a new level of backstabbing, revenge, and general bloodthirstiness, which is what makes it such a blast to play.  Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.<br/><br/>Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.<br/><br/>Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.<br/><br/>In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Wars of the Roses were fought between the Houses of York and Lancaster for over three decades during the 15th century in England. The houses were both branches of the royal family, therefore the Wars were originally known as &quot;The Cousins' War&quot;. Each player represents one of the houses as they fight battles and gain influence to control England.<br/><br/>The Cousins' War is played over a maximum of five rounds, with each round representing between five and ten years of the conflict. Each round involves gaining influence across England and preparing for a climactic battle.<br/><br/>In each round, the players decide where the current battlefield will be, playing action cards to deploy troops to the battlefield, while also increasing or decreasing their influence in the regions, after which they fight. Players resolve the battle by engaging in bluff and counter-bluff, using three dice, until only one side has troops remaining on the field. Winning the battle helps to consolidate your house's influence on the board.<br/><br/>You win The Cousins' War either by dominating all the regions of England or by controlling the most regions at the end of the fifth round.<br/><br/>Two promo cards are included in each copy of The Cousins' War: Guilds of London: The Secret Guild of Guildsmen and Snowdonia: Supply Wagon/Cannon<br/><br/>",

Uncover sweet and strange secrets about prospective Crushes while navigating hilarious relationship milestones that will leave your feelings reeling as you play. Only by correctly predicting who makes your friends swoon will you live happily ever after with your own Dream Crush!<br/><br/>Inspired by the classic dating games of the past half-century or so, Dream Crush was brought to life by Found Footage Fest cofounder Nick Prueher, with graphic design by Chris Bilheimer and the Mondo team, original artwork by We Buy Your Kids, and incredible photography by Carli Davidson featuring a gorgeous cast of Crushes.<br/><br/>The game is played over five rounds: in each round, a Milestone Card with steadily increasing impact is revealed (ex: &ldquo;They ask you to be on their bar trivia team&rdquo; or &ldquo;You must co-sign a lease with one Crush&rdquo;. Next, a Secret about each Crush is revealed, lending insight into their unique personalities and lifestyles.<br/><br/>Each player secretly chooses a Crush to embark upon the Milestone with, writing it on their scorecard, while also predicting who their friends will pick. Once everyone has recorded their answers, players take turns revealing their choices, often engaging in passionate table-talk defending their decision-making process (which becomes more agonizing as the rounds pass).<br/><br/>All correct guesses count as points toward a total that will determine the winner at the end of the game.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Players spend these dice to purchase and complete rail contracts, deliver cargo, and improve their companies&rsquo; competitive abilities. Who can build the best rail network and deliver the most profitable goods? Get rolling and find out!<br/><br/>Players begin the game with a pool of six dice with multi-colored sides. On each turn, a player can spend his or her dice to purchase contracts, construct rail links, build switching stations, purchase improvements and deliver one cargo of passengers or freight. Unused dice can be converted into stockpile markers for future use. By purchasing improvements, players can gain more dice with special abilities, become more efficient at laying rail or stockpiling dice, or increase the points they receive when other players deliver cargo over their rails. Bonus points are awarded for delivering passengers quickly or delivering freight over long distances.<br/><br/>The large, two-sided, colorful board has two maps. The western U.S. map, from the California gold rush era, is designed for 2 &ndash; 4 players. With many double-track routes, this map allows newer players to effectively plan their networks and maximize deliveries. The southeastern U.S. map, depicting the late Nineteenth Century, has only single-track routes that are significantly interwoven. This provides more advanced strategic options and is intended for 3 &ndash; 5 experienced players.<br/><br/>",

In the first round, each player lays down a card, drafts one of the available cards, then moves one of her ships to the right on the ocean. Players then repeat this process, possibly starting a new journey &mdash; a.k.a., new row of played cards &mdash; or adding to the journey already begun by playing a higher-valued card that what was last played. In the latter case, if the color of the card matches the color of the card previously played, the ship moves directly to the right; otherwise the ship moves both down and right.<br/><br/>When a player can't add to a journey any more and must start a new one, she scores that voyage, possibly claiming one of the ship tiles on display based on the length of the voyage. (Each space on the game board's ocean has values on it, and the more times you move both down and right, the higher your score overall &mdash; doing this is more difficult than you'd hope for, however, since you must consistently have cards that are both of higher value and different color.) Each ship bears some combination of gems, and those are worth points at the end of the game.<br/><br/>If you have certain symbols on a voyage, you can claim bonus action cards that let you steal gems or cards from opponents, take cards from the discard pile, insert cards in a voyage, and so on. Get the right symbols, and you can claim the Madame Ching vessel, ending the game. Players then tally their points for destinations, gems, and so forth, and whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

In Bring Your Own Book, players take turns drawing prompts from the deck, then race to find the best phrase in their own book that satisfies the prompt. What's the tastiest &ldquo;name for a candy bar&rdquo; in that history textbook you're reading for school? How quickly can you find &ldquo;lyrics from a country western song&rdquo; in your dog-training guide? What kind of &ldquo;advice for graduating seniors&rdquo; will appear in your anthology of limericks?<br/><br/>In more detail, everyone has their own book and sits in a circle. The cards are placed face down, and the starting player has a one-minute timer. The starting player takes the top card off the deck, picks a prompt, and reads it aloud. Everyone except the Picker searches their book for text to match the prompt, sequential text of any length: a single word, half of a sentence, a whole sentence, multiple sentences, etc.<br/><br/>The first Seeker to find matching text announces &quot;I've got it&quot; and starts the timer. When the timer runs out (or every Seeker announces &quot;I've got it&quot;), each Seeker reads what they've found. Seekers who didn't find text in time open to a random page and read a random sentence from it. The Picker chooses their favorite submission and awards the card to that Reader. After each round, the person to the left of the last Picker starts the next round. Once any player holds three cards, everyone passes their book to the player on their left. This happens any time a player reaches three cards during the game. Thus, it can happen as many times as there are players.<br/><br/>The game proceeds until one player has collected the required number of cards and wins: with 5-7 players the first to 4 cards win; with 3-4 players the first to 5 cards win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "18EU is an 18xx title which depicts a century of European railroading from the 1830s to the 1930s. It shares much in common with other 18xx titles, but also includes 15 minor companies. They are auctioned before the game starts, then pay 50/50 dividend (Minor/Owner) and finally merge to form corporations. Another special element are bonuses for completing long runs between off-map areas, that can affect huge incomes in the end game. The map stretches from France to Austria and Poland, and from northern Germany to middle Italy and features the Alps as mountains (higher tile laying costs). The game is played in sets of two operating rounds, where the railroads are built, followed by one stock round, where shares are bought and sold.<br/><br/>The general idea of all 18xx titles is holding shares of railway companies, building railroads by laying hex-tiles, running trains and generating income paid out as dividend. The special thing (and difference to other games) is the difference between the players&acute; private money and the money in the companies&acute; treasuries. In the end the player, who managed to acquire the biggest private fortune, wins the game!<br/><br/>",

It takes place on a post-apocalyptic Earth where most of the water on the planet has been gone for seventy years.<br/><br/>Even though what was left of mankind found a way to adapt using water, the most valuable asset on the planet, as currency, survival turned the world into a wicked wasteland where it's either kill or be killed. And evil not only endured, it won.<br/><br/>People turned to dark arts, old tales of mischief and curses to survive. Death is everywhere. But for every darkness there is light - and among the few and cursed are those willing to fight to bring balance to the land: the Curse Chasers.<br/><br/>In the game, players take on the role of a &quot;Curse Chaser&quot; looking to make a name for themselves by searching for supernatural artifacts, completing jobs, or bounty hunting. Players traverse the desert of the Pacific Ocean as they improvise and acquire new cards for their deck on their quest for fame or infamy.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In a reversal of roles, all players in Munchkin Zombies start out as zombies, and the &quot;monsters&quot; are the normal people trying to stop the zombie invasion (such as the Action Hero, Soccer Mom, Fireman, etc.). Unlike most Munchkin games, there are no classes or races; instead, you can have a mojo: Atomic Zombie, Plague Zombie, and Voodoo Zombie. As with Munchkin Bites! and Super Munchkin, Munchkin Zombies includes powers &ndash; special abilities that you can play as you gain levels.<br/><br/>Guest artist is Alex Fernandez, who drew the Meals on Wheels card.<br/><br/>Part of the Munchkin series.<br/><br/>Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.<br/><br/>There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.<br/><br/>Note: The 2012 edition of Munchkin Zombies from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Munchkin Zombies 2: Armed and Dangerous.<br/><br/>",

One team selects the category and presses the start button. An audible timer beeps a count-down while the person holding the device tries to get their team to say the word or phrase on the screen. If they are successful, they hand the device to the next person on the opposite team. The goal of the round is to not be holding the device when the timer goes off -- though those last furtive seconds can get dicey! When the timer goes off, the opposing team gets a point and (based on what version of the game you are playing) may also have a chance to steal the phrase for an extra point. The first team to reach seven points wins!<br/><br/>The primary differences of this game from its progenitor is the implementation of the electronic device, timer, and substantial word lists. The electronic edition has also spawned several spin-offs and sequels. As of 2013, &quot;Electronic&quot; was dropped from the name, leaving it as simply Catch Phrase, effectively replacing the original.<br/><br/>Re-implements:<br/><br/>    Catch Phrase!<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Published by Avalon Hill in 1989 (for the Third edition).<br/><br/>(from MMP's web site:)<br/><br/>It is 70 A.D.  Dawn breaks on the combined might of four Legions arrayed on the heights of Mount Scopus, starting their methodical advance across the valley to the ancient walled city of Jerusalem.  Siege lines have been secured tight about the city.  There is no hope of escape.  The besieged must persist behind their stout walls or perish before a vengeful Rome.  Five grueling years of campaigning in Judea is now culminating in the Siege of Jerusalem.<br/><br/>But the fortified city defies even the might of Rome.  The thick walls atop the steep slopes literally bristle with natural and manmade fortifications.  It will take all of Rome's considerable engineering skills to winch their war machines into position for an assault up the slopes to the city.  Only here in the north plain can the city's walls be taken by escalade.  The rhythmic approach of the Legions is muted by the rumble of the siege engines as an assortment of towers, rams, and artillery precede the maniples.  The distant walls seethe with the frenzied activity of an alerted populace as the antagonists draw near.  This majestic view is abruptly halted by the blare of trumpets which soon gives way to the cacophony of the clash of arms and screams of the dying.<br/><br/>Morning turns to dusk before the walls are breached and the weary legions exact their vengeance.  The sky turns bright again, aglow in the reflection of a thousand fires as the northern outskirts burn.  But what price victory?  Another day such as this will break the Roman Army and only one of the city's ten walled sections has fallen this day.  They will have to find another way.  Shafts must be dug to undermine the walls or earthen ramps built with which to scale them.  It will be a long campaign.<br/><br/>This is The Siege of Jerusalem...An epic battle simulation with all the trappings and majesty of a Cecil B. DeMille film spectacular.  Facing the greatest army of antiquity, the Judeans must rely on the stoutness of their walls to halt the unbeatable Roman legions and therein lies the fascination:  the immovable object vs the unstoppable force.  As Eliezar Ben Yair, leader of the Zealots, you must conduct a skilled defense of the city's ever shrinking perimeter - exacting from the Romans a price so terrible that they will be forced to lift their siege - or break out to continue your struggle for freedom at Massada.  As Titus, commander of the Roman army, you must decide when, where and how to renew the assault - gauging your troop needs against the progress of your siege works and the press of time caused by outside threats.  More than just conducting tactical combat, the Roman must formulate an overall strategic plan for the conduct of the siege.<br/><br/>Vastly revised from its 1st &amp; 2nd edition printing from Historical Perspectives in the 70's, Siege of Jerusalem now boasts two-sided counters, a continuous combat system, a strategic interphase for conducting the entire siege, and the morale / panic rules so important in portraying ancient warfare.  An Introductory Scenario depicting the abortive assault of Gallus with the XII Legion three years previous allows players to learn how to handle a legion in a single day's play while training for eventual participation in the conduct of the epic siege.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1841 is the apex (or nadir depending on your point of view) of 18xx stock-market manipulation. Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.<br/><br/>The greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies. Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep &gt;1400 for an 8 train - the largest.<br/><br/>There are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical &quot;generic&quot; corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to &quot;successful&quot; companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.<br/><br/>1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.<br/><br/>Chris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.  Deep Thought Games now publishes 1841v2 which incorporates changes by Manlio Manzini to address some of the perceived shortcomings with the original which was designed by Federico Vellani with Manlio as a co-author.<br/><br/>Description by Steve Thomas:<br/><br/>1841 is the 18xx game of choice for many players, though some hate it. Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate. It's exciting and dynamic, and the only real downside, at least for &quot;the financiers who've had enough of the engineers&quot;, to misquote the 1853 box art, is the length of the game. At typically seven hours it cannot sensibly be played in an evening. Even so, the game is usually well worth the investment of time, though it's certainly not for the novice.<br/><br/>",

Test your wit and instincts in this two-player game of vision and versatility!<br/><br/>Agility applies a unique mechanic in which cards that supply resources also select actions. On your turn, you play a Training Card that provides one of two types of resources in varying quantities while also granting an action building off of what your opponent just played. This encourages clever planning and timing. Training you need may be at odds with the action you&rsquo;d like, so weighing your options will be crucial. Resources may be used to adopt dogs or to clear obstacles on the three courses you've drafted from the six available each game. Courses can only be claimed once a dog is adopted, so there is a race within a race to snatch up Wonderdogs or Underdogs well suited to the available courses. Then it&rsquo;s nip and tuck as the canine competitors bound over, under, and through to the finish lines!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Skies Above Britain is a solitaire game depicting a Royal Air Force squadron of Hurricanes or Spitfires waging a desperate effort to disrupt and destroy German daylight bombing raids over southeast England in the summer of 1940.<br/><br/>The player&rsquo;s individual aircraft&mdash;each represented by a stickered block&mdash;must locate the incoming raid, intercept it, and evade or defeat swarms of escorting German fighters that usually outnumber you and whose pilots have superior experience and tactics. <br/>The game simulates the dogfighting and fighter-vs.-bomber action at an individual aircraft level using a card-assisted system that simulates key tactical decision-making without losing the feel of fast-paced aerial combat. A player can fly scenarios representing an individual patrol or use the patrol generator to create an endless variety of realistic individual patrols, multi-patrol campaigns, or larger campaigns covering the entire Battle of Britain. Each patrol will take a half hour or more to play, while a campaign can last anywhere between 6 and 28 patrols.<br/><br/>COMPONENTS<br/><br/>        1 Interception Game Board<br/>        1 Squadron Display Game Board<br/>        1 Me-110 Circle Display<br/>        4 Counter Sheets<br/>        1 Rules Booklet<br/>        1 Situation Manual<br/>        1 Optionals Booklet<br/>        3 Player Aid Cards<br/>        200 Playing Cards<br/>        1 Pad of Roster Sheets<br/>        2 Historical Log Sheets<br/>        1 Sheet of Stickers<br/>        38 Wooden Blocks<br/>        10 Wooden Cubes<br/>        1 Wooden Cylinder<br/>        2 Dice <br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In 1607 Monteverdi&rsquo;s Opera La Favola d&rsquo;Orfeo had its worldwide premiere. Over the following centuries, Europe was taken over. In the board game Opera, the players bring Opera to the public. In Venice, Vienna, Berlin, London, Paris and Milan great Opera houses arise. Opera leads the players through the periods of Baroque, Classicism and Romanticism. The epic music of six famous composers H&auml;ndel, Monteverdi, Mozart, Beethoven, Wagner and Verdi will bring the public to their Opera houses.<br/><br/>Clever budgeting is essential to gain control and be the master of your own success. Each round the players determine their budget level to influence the order of play and to activate the characters in the game. The players build new Opera Houses, scout for new Operas of popular composers and try to earn some money. Sometimes they choose to cash in at the Palazzo where the Signora pays them well, but in the long term music are one of the key fundamentals to build your empire. The elegant Maestro brings the performance of an Opera to a higher level and the Critico can make or break a composer. Do not overvalue the three counting rounds with progressively growing value, because a well timed appearance of the Esperto might just bring you the victory in Opera. Ducats and capacity are key elements to facilitate the growth of your empire and influence, but in the end wealth is just an instrument to attain higher ends.<br/><br/>In Opera the players must plan well. Introducing an Intermezzo from time to time might be helpful to seize the initiative on a decisive moment in the game. Opera takes place over 9 rounds of play, divided in 3 episodes. Each episode consists of three playing rounds and a counting round. The player with the highest number of victory points after the third and last counting round will be the victor.<br/><br/>",

Stock up your truck, attract customers, and serve a hefty scoop of tasty frozen delight! The best truckers get to know their customers' favorite selections so that they can always meet demand and gain an edge over the competition in the battle to claim the hottest locations. You'll see the business of icy entrepreneurship is no day at the beach. Buckle up, turn on the loudspeaker, and take to the rocky road...with ice cream!<br/><br/>Rocky Road &agrave; la Mode is a game of managing time and resources to meet the demands of sweet-treat-seekers! The game features multi-use cards and a time track that determines the players' turn order. The player whose ice cream truck is furthest back on the road goes next and may choose from several actions on their turn: stocking up on new treats, playing music over the loudspeaker to attract business, or passing out treats to fulfill customer desires. Every choice costs time and forces players to move ahead on the road track. Once a player is no longer in the rear of the pack, their turn ends until they find themselves lagging behind again.<br/><br/>In addition to gaining loyalty points from happy customers, players can gain bonus treats in their permanent supply so that they can meet demand a little easier. Throughout the game, players also fight to earn the right to take over several of the different territories that make summer great: the beach, the pool, the park, and the ballfield.<br/><br/>",

Each of the eight companies has 2-5 shares available, depending on the number of players, and each player starts with a randomly drawn share. At the start of the game, place six movement tiles (numbered 1-6) in one bag and six action tiles (trade x3, rank +1, rank -1, no action) in another bag.<br/><br/>Each round, the starting player draws one tile from each bag. If he draws a rank +1 or rank -1, he moves one share price indicator (a.k.a. &quot;brick&quot;) of his choice up or down one rank on the movement track that organizes the company bricks. If he draws a trade, each player buys and/or sells one share to the bank. Players then simultaneously choose one of the two cards in their hand and reveal them. If no one played a bank holiday card, then in turn order, the brick associated with each company card advances on the movement track a number of spaces equal to the movement tile drawn, ignoring occupied spaces. The value of a company's shares depends on the location of its brick on the movement track and its position relative to all of the other bricks. If one or more bank holiday cards were played, the bricks move only half the distance or don't move at all.)<br/><br/>Players each draw a new card, and the bags pass to the next player in clockwise order, who becomes the starting player for the next round. If a trade tile was drawn, return all tiles to their respective bags first. The rounds continue until one or more company bricks reach the end of the movement track.

        "description": "Tanto Cuore: Romantic Vacation, the second expansion for the deck-building game Tanto Cuore in addition to being a standalone game, is themed around a paradise island vacation. (&quot;Dokidoki&quot;, the sound of heartbeat in Japanese, means &quot;exciting&quot; or &quot;romantic&quot;, which is why the English name is &quot;Romantic Vacation&quot;.) Players take the role of house lords and start with a deck containing some love cards and a few maids. During the game, players gradually employ more maids, increasing their deck of cards, and the player who collects the most victory points wins.<br/><br/>Romantic Vacation includes love cards and maid cards like the parent game, but no event cards (curse cards) nor private maids (unique cards with a lasting effect). Instead the game introduces reminiscence cards, representing memorial events, like &quot;Camp Fire&quot;, &quot;Watching the stars&quot;, &quot;Picnic&quot;, etc. These cards are worth substantial victory points, but unlike the other victory points they are not bought with love, but gained by discarding a specified number of maid cards from your hand, thus introducing the possibility of getting victory points from pure maid cards, previously not possible. These reminiscence cards never enter a player's deck.<br/><br/>",

Both games use the same rules and share many game pieces, but each has a separate full size map.<br/><br/>Sickle Cut: Guderian's Drive to the Channel<br/><br/>This game covers the crucial week in May 1940 when the German army broke the French line on the Meuse and raced to the sea at Abbeville. The game starts on May 13th, the third day of Case Yellow. Six panzer divisions have passed through the Ardennes and are now at the Meuse River. The French and British have raced through Belgium to reach the Dyle Line and cover the Gembloux Gap. The stage is set. Can the Germans cross the Meuse in front of strong opposition? And, if they can, will they be able to break out from the bridgeheads and advance across the map while threatened by Allied reinforcements pouring in from the north and south?<br/><br/>Dynamo: Retreat to Victory<br/><br/>This game covers the British withdrawal to Dunkirk and the evacuation. The game starts on May 24th, the day the British decide that the B.E.F. is in real danger of being cut-off from their supply base and the best option is to head for the coast at Dunkirk. However, many of the German panzer divisions are closer to Dunkirk than the British. Can the British reach the coast before the Germans? Can they hold the Dunkirk perimeter for eight days while they evacuate?<br/> The rules for both games highlight armor, air support, and morale. Special rules include: Allied Heavy Tanks, DeGaulle, Rommel, Hitler's Halt Order, and French Command Paralysis. Note that the two maps may be linked together for players to study the entire period from May 13th to June 3rd, but there is no combined game scenario.<br/><br/>TIME SCALE:     1 day per turn<br/>MAP SCALE:     4 miles per hex<br/>UNIT SCALE:     Divisions, Brigades, Regiments, and Battalions<br/><br/><br/>COMPONENTS:<br/>    2 Paper Maps<br/>    2 Countersheets<br/>    24 Page Rulebook<br/>    16 Page Playbook<br/>    2 Identical Player Aid Cards<br/>    2 Setup Cards<br/>    Two 6-sided Dice<br/><br/>DESIGNER: Mark Simonitch<br/>MAP &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch<br/><br/>(from GMT website and BGG user)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction (from the rule book):<br/><br/>BLACKBEARD recreates &quot;The Golden Age of Piracy&quot; at the turn of the 18th century. Each player becomes one or more pirates and attempts to amass a fortune and retire before a King's Commissioner tracks him down, a Warship stumbles across him, or his own crew cuts his throat! Merchant ships plying the trade routes are the targets. Prizes range from near-worthless supplies to the fabulous Spanish and Mogul treasure ships. Luck, skill and cunning all play a part as you comb the Seven Seas (well ... at least three of them) for fame and fortune. Players should be aware that the game simulates 18th century piracy and therefore features random happenstance. Little can be planned. Players who are ready to strike when opportunity presents itself and are wily and aggressive without being rash will fare best in the long run.<br/><br/><br/>Players take up the roles of famous pirates navigating the major sea lanes during the golden age of piracy.  Plunder and pirateering await as each player moves about on the map in a variable system through a deck of cards.  Rather than the normal turn order in games, players move when their designation is drawn in a deck.  When not in the role of their pirate they can take on the role of one of the English military ships hunting the sea for pirates.  By making shrewd choices and having some luck the player can end the game a wealthy and retired pirate with a large fleet of ships that have been accumulated over the years.<br/><br/>",

You will compete with your coworkers for access to building blueprints, astronauts, and construction resources- all to develop the most successful moonbase!<br/><br/>Lunarchitects is a medium-weight strategy game that has players moving their pawns forward in a refilling circular queue to claim building blueprints. Players use the claimed blueprints to build personal moonbase plans in front of them. But instead of turns proceeding clockwise, the player furthest behind in the queue always takes the next turn. This makes blueprint choices a matter of quality over quantity.<br/><br/>Blueprints from four stages are shuffled then stacked, with stages increasing in both cost and power. Each time all players complete a lap of the blueprint queue, scoring occurs- and the game ends after the fourth round of scoring. The player who has collected the most points is the winner, and their plans will guide the creation the first settlement on the moon!<br/><br/>Unknown tile arrangement and variable scoring schemes (determined before the start) makes the game very replayable, as there is never a single most-powerful strategy.<br/><br/>Inspired by the well-loved game Glen More, Lunarchitects is a family game for 1-5 players that plays in about an hour.<br/><br/>",

In Canterbury, 2 to 4 players represent Saxon Lords who are charged with building the city into a prosperous capital. The Saxon Lords must use the city's meager starting resources to build up the 25 districts of Canterbury and provide key services to its citizens.<br/><br/>The key services are (in order from most basic to most prestigious) water, food, religion, defense, commerce, and culture. These services are provided by structures that are built in the various districts. However, structures that provide higher end services can only be built if the more basic services are already present in that district. For example, a Saxon Lord cannot order the construction of a chapel (which provides religion) unless there is already water and food in that district.<br/><br/>As new structures are built in the city, the city grows more prosperous. While each Saxon Lord jealously guards his or her own prosperity and achievements, they all benefit as a whole from the growing prosperity of the city itself. The city treasury grows as the city prospers, and the Saxon Lords must balance their publicly scrutinized withdrawals from the treasury with the ambition of their building projects. When the city reaches the peak of its prosperity, the game ends and the player with the most individual prosperity wins the game.<br/><br/>Object of the Game<br/><br/>Every structure that is built in Canterbury provides Prosperity Points both to the city and to the Saxon Lord who ordained its construction.

You start with standard six-sided dice, and throughout the course of the game you can remove sides and replace them with other sides that let you do all sorts of wonderful things. Every time you score points, you get closer to finding Rattlebones and, er, winning the game. Yes, winning! It's an experience to six-sided-die for!<br/><br/><br/>Game Summary<br/>Setup<br/>- Place the Rattlebones meeple at 55, 60, or 65 VP space (for 2-4 players). Players each get 3 d6 (black, white, gray) -- basic d6 but the '1' is replaced by Rattlebones.<br/>- Place random tiles on the empty spaces on the board.<br/><br/>Your Turn<br/>Roll a die. May spend 1-2 gold to roll an extra 1-2 dice. Then, use each die one at a time:<br/>- if Rattlebones shows, move Rattlebones back one space; game ends immediately if it hits a player score marker and most points wins.<br/>- if pips or Rattlebones showing, move one of your pawns clockwise that many spaces (RB=1) and use the space you land on. Typically, you may add a die face matching that space to the die you used (replace any face except Rattlebones).<br/>- otherwise, take whatever action the face allows (e.g., earn a stock marker or star token, which you may later turn in for VP; earn VP; steal stuff from other people; etc.).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The frequent tremors, the looming clouds over the crater, and the ever-increasing smell of sulfur make it clear that it is time to escape. Direct your tribe through the waters of the Pacific in search of a new home, safe from the impending eruption of the volcano. Explore new sea routes that lead to unvisited islands, collect resources on those islands to offer to other tribes in exchange for their knowledge, and continue sailing in search of a safe place &mdash; all this being done to save as many of your tribe members as possible and lead them to new lands where they can prosper. The most successful individual through this difficult mission will be appointed the supreme chief of the Polynesian tribal group.<br/><br/>In Polynesia, players must save their tribe members from the dangers of the volcano by taking them to the islands that will give them the most points. At the same time, players must try to reach the objectives set by the tide cards, which will vary from one game to another. To succeed, players must collect resources in the form of fish and shells that will allow them to explore new sea routes, use the routes of other players, and sail from one island to another.<br/><br/>Polynesia is played in rounds, and each round is divided into two phases. In the action phase, each player has three turns in which they can perform one of three actions: sail, explore, or populate and fish. In the maintenance phase, the volcano activity is checked for activity, and each player can collect resources depending on the islands where they have tribe members.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",
