They may also capture an enemy piece (or a series of them) by jumping over it to a vacant junction beyond.<br/><br/>Once across the river a Soldier may move two squares or capture pieces two squares ahead or to the side, or capture a piece an adjacent piece and land two squares past it.<br/><br/>When a Soldier reaches the far side it promotes to an Elephant (the name source).  <br/> Elephants may move to any vacant junction (since Xiangqi is played on the points, not sqaures) vertically or horizontally. They capture by jumping over an enemy piece, and can continue to any empty square beyond the capture.<br/><br/>&quot;They may promote to King and win the game if on the Throne point in the center of the opposing fortress, but that move counts as a non-capturing move, and can not be made when there is a capture available.&quot;<br/><br/>",

Players are dealt a hand of 9 cards. Game play consists of laying cards to form complete words, which are scored against a table. <br/>A player's turn begins by drawing a card from either the draw pile or the top of the discard pile, then continues with the laying of whatever words the player can make with the cards in his or her hand, then finishes with the laying of an additional card to the discard pile.  Players may also capture words made by other players by adding letters to the played word to form a new word.<br/>A round ends when someone fully discards his hand by playing a word or words.  The player does not need to be able to discard a card if playing all cards into words.<br/><br/><br/>A later version of this game was published together with the dice game Farkel; that game has a deck half the size.",

Using a deck of cards, the game has various kinds of techniques to challenge a parent's view, and to help them see the world differently. For example, you might be asked to role-play a scenario, but with a specific attitude alien to your normal thinking.

There are no 'right' or 'wrong' answers, and gamers may not consider Alles Paletti?! to be a game in the normal sense.

Instead of the standard Monopoly board layout, the game has 45 properties. Each property costs $5,000, and the rent for each property is $1,000 times the number of properties next to it owned by the same player (so as more properties are owned in a row the rent goes up). Once all of the properties have been purchased from the bank, players can buy property chains from one another. The other major change is the concept of &quot;marriage&quot;. When two players become land on the same square, they become married. Later, if you are married and land on your spouse's square, you sue for divorce and talk half of their property. If you are married and land on the single players square, the marriage gets annuled and the player gets sent to &quot;Morrow Rock&quot; (the game's equivalent to jail).<br/><br/>",

My solo game rules for the pictured dice (which can be purchased at <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/</a>) is as follows:<br/><br/>Many Dungeon Dice<br/><br/>You&rsquo;ll need the many monster dice, paper to keep track of your character and draw out your dungeon, and a pen.<br/><br/>Roll the D20 to discover how many monsters you must encounter during your game and mark this value down. You must defeat this number of monsters to win the game without being slain yourself. Any gold and jewels you have left at the end if yours to keep.<br/><br/>Then, with the five numbered dice, assign one die to each 5 values - monster hit point die, and attack and defense dice.<br/><br/>Roll the map die, drawing out your dungeon as you go. Be as artistic as you like in this. Stairs and doors always have traps. Each door you roll will enter into a room, and there will always be a unlocked exit door in an adjacent wall. The T corridor branches off into other hallways and you may backtrack your path if you wish during exploration.<br/><br/>If you roll a door or a stair check first for a trap by rolling the 3 trap dice, if two faces match that trap is sprung.<br/><br/>Next, if you rolled a door, you enter the room. Roll the colored monster die to see what level of monster you will fight, and roll the corresponding colored monster die to see what you will fight. You always have initiative in an encounter.<br/><br/>To battle:<br/><br/>Roll your Battle Strength die and add that value to your Battle Strength for a magical weapon if you possess one. Then roll for the monster. Depending on the color and type of monster they will have different strengths and powers as summarized in the rules.<br/><br/>Once you have defeated a monster you may roll for treasure using the Treasure Die.<br/><br/>Explore the dungeon until you defeat/kill all the monsters you are required to. If you do this count yourself lucky you survived with your limbs and sanity intact. Spend your gold at the nearest wenchery or tavern.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kō shōgi is a large-board variant of shogi, or Japanese chess. The game dates back to the turn of the 18th century and is based on xiangqi and go as well as shogi. Credit for its invention has been given to Confucian scholar Ogyū Sorai. Unlike standard shogi, pieces may not be dropped back into play after being captured. Promotion rules are complex, and the fates of several pieces are interdependent. The objective is to capture the opponent's commanding pieces: The general, plus the governor if present, or either the banner or middle army if not. Two players, Black and White, play on a go board ruled into a grid of 19 ranks (rows) by 19 files (columns) with a total of 361 intersections. Each player has a set of 90 pieces of 34 different types. The pieces are round and flattened like go stones. In all, the players must remember 65 different moves. The pieces are generally of the same size, though black pieces may be slightly larger than white pieces. Each piece has its name in the form of one or two Japanese characters marked on its face, in white on black stones and in black on white stones. On the reverse side of most pieces are other characters in red; this side is turned up to indicate that the piece has been promoted during play. - Wiki (<a target='_blank' href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_shogi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ko_shogi</a>)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Contains two games in one box. From the publisher:<br/>Giftrace: You are Santa Claus and you need to follow the path from the beginning to the end. On your way you leave one gift (a ring in your colour) on each house when you land on a house square or pass it. Score points are given accourding to who is first, second, third and forth to arrive to the end zone. The first person gets 4 points, second gets 3 pts, the third gets 2 pts and the last one gets one point. But, for each gift that you still have remaining (rings on your pawn) you get one minus point for each ring! The person with the most points wins!<br/><br/>Sledrace: Each player chooses a pawn and puts it on the sled in the same colour. The rings are not used in this game. The person that looks most like a racing driver starts! You throw the die and move accordingly. When you land on a square with a picture, you immediately follow the instructions on that square, then your turn ends. Please note that if you pass an X you stop right away because you just hit a tree and the rest of your moves in that turn are cancelled! The player on your left goes next. The first person to reach the finish line wins and gets the trophy!<br/><br/>",

To discard a card, you need to find or create a group of three cars positioned in the same pattern on the game board as is shown on your card.<br/><br/>Everyone plays simultaneously. To move a car on the board, take the green light from another player, then move a car of your choice one space in the desired direction. (If you hold the green light, you must wait for another player to take the light and move a car before you can make another move.)<br/><br/>As soon as you spot a matching combination, say &quot;Beep! Beep!&quot;, then show your card to other players so that they can verify that you're correct. If you goofed, the player who spots the error gives you a card from her hand as punishment for you and a bonus for her. When one player runs out of cards, the game ends; anyone with cards still in hand receives penalty points equal to the number of cards they hold. The player with the lowest score after three rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>The cards with green backgrounds show more complicated traffic patterns and can be used to handicap experienced players. You can also give them to the player with the lowest score after rounds one and two to give the other players a better chance against this movement maven.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An idea of doing a horse race around Stonehenge came to my mind. This then lead into the concept of BETTING on the race. From here, the basic rules flowed. Then, it occurred to me that Mike Selinker already did a race game around Stonehenge, so I felt it appropriate to connect this game to his chariot racing game. Due to the odd play nature of the betting, it is a natural that it would be alien in nature. The name is Mike Selinker's name spelled backwards, in honor of his Chariot racing game. Spelling it backwards also gives it an alien sounding name.<br/><br/>Number of players: 2&ndash;5<br/><br/>Object of the game: To score the LEAST amount of points. This represents the player, as an alien bidder, being able to best predict the future.<br/>Getting Started<br/><br/>Equipment: Deck of 60 cards without the five trilithon cards.<br/>Five trilithon cards in a separate pile<br/>Ten disks of each color (50 total)<br/>Five figures (neutral is not used). These figures represent chariot drivers.<br/><br/>The player who has the least amount of points shows themselves the best predictor of the worst racer, and wins the game. If players are tied, the player who has the most disks amongst all the tied players wins. If still a tie, then the player with the least amount of first place disks wins. If still a tie, the player with the least amount of second place disks wins. If still a tie, then least in third, fourth or fifth. If still a tie, player closest to the starting player wins.<br/><br/>For more conventional wagering, use the variant where the object is to score the MOST points, not LEAST.<br/><br/>",

Whenever a player scores, they move their figure from one side of the bluestone track to the other side.<br/>Getting Started<br/><br/>Equipment: <br/>The Stonehenge board.<br/>10 disks of each color for each player.<br/>1 figure per player, matching the set of colored disks that a player has.<br/>Grey neutral figure (tracks where player removes piece from).<br/><br/>The outer track consists of 30 spaces, each with four parts, for each number (30 in all) from inside most to outside (making for a total of 120 spaces). In this game, the two day-night spaces, next to the number, on the inside are considered one space. The the next most outside space is the number space. After this comes the colored space. Outside most is a light or dark space. Each of these spaces is considered able to hold one piece in this game. As players place their pieces on the board, in a space, the first piece is put on the day-night space, the second on the number space, the third on the color space, and the last piece is placed on the light or dark space outer section.<br/><br/>Overview of gameplay:<br/>Players alternate turns putting their pieces on the board into one of four spaces on the outer track. A piece either immediately comes from their reserve, or it is taken from the board and put into their reserve and then played, if the player as no pieces in their reserve at the start of their turn. After a player places a piece on the board, pieces may end up sliding towards the inside part of the outer track, and then the board is checked for scoring conditions. If there are scoring conditions, pieces will be removed from the board and put into reserve(s) and scoring occurs. After this more pieces may end up sliding towards the inside part of the outer track and the scoring process is repeated.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player scores 6 points (player's figure hits the last space on the bluestone track), gets 10 pieces in a row, or is the last remaining player. In event of a tie, all players not tied for win at the end of the game eliminated. Then the remaining players play until one player score more points than anyone else in the game. This player wins the game. Players eliminated from the game are treated as they normally would be in the game, with their pieces remaining on the board, but can't win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "I think some of the best games have a number of characteristics in common: they have simple rules, they are quick and they have a high replayability factor. The Stonehenge games are a good example of this. With this in mind, I recalled a number of these games and all of a sudden, there was the idea of creating a game of my own; a quick racing game with easy rules and a high replayability factor: Stonerush.<br/><br/>Number of players: 3&ndash;5<br/><br/>Object of the game: The players are druids who come home to Stonehenge after a hard days work. As part of their daily ritual (or just having fun), they try to be the first to run around the great stone circle. The player whose druid arrives first on case 30 of the outer ring is the winner.<br/>Getting Started<br/><br/>Equipment: - The board<br/>- The number cards: you will need all the cards, except the &quot;night&quot;-cards from 13 to 30.<br/>- The trilithon cards<br/>- The 5 figures, also called druids (even with 3 or 4 players!)<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>When a figure reaches case 30 of the outer ring, the players reveal their trilithon card. The player whose color matches that of the figure that reached case 30 is the winner. If this color belongs to no-one (for example in a 3-player game), the winner is the player who has advanced the most.<br/><br/>Variant: for a quicker game, use the bluestones as the racing track.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After developing Raiding Stonehenge, it became apparent the game was best suited for 4-5 players. This meant the initial 2-3 players planned for the gamer were dropped and put into the unrecommended category. Seeing that Raiding Stonehenge was a good game, and feeling a need to come up with more 2 player Euro-style games, I decided to adapt Raiding Stonehenge to two players. Raiding Duel is the result.<br/><br/>Number of players: 2<br/><br/>Object of the game: The object of the game is to score the most points after two rounds of play. Players score 10 points for each complete set of disks they collect at end of game. A set normally contains one disk of each color: White, red, green, blue, yellow. Players LOSE one point for each disk not in a set.<br/>Getting Started<br/><br/>Equipment: Deck of 60 cards, excluding the Trilithon cards. 50 disks, 10 per color. Each disk type represents a different item type from Camelot. 1 gray figure (to indicate start player). A way to track score.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>After the second round is over, the game ends. At that point, game is over, and players total up their points for both rounds. The player with the most points wins. In event of a tie, players keep playing two cards from their hand, as they have done prior. until they are down to only two cards. The player with the highest card in their hand wins. If both players tie, they each look for the next highest card in their hand. If, after that, the players are still tied, the game ends in a tie.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "We were working on a Stonehenge game of our own when we came across the anthology box. Not surprisingly, the board and pieces were very similar to those that we had developed, so it was fairly simple to transfer most of our ideas to match those provided. Our game links Stonehenge to the magical powers of the Earth and other elements and is basically a battle for magical supremacy.<br/><br/>Number of players: 3&ndash;5<br/><br/>Object of the game: The object of the game is to use your magical powers (represented by the cards) to convince the local clans (represented by disks on the bluestones) and spirits (represented by bars on the outer ring) that you are the druid most able to carry out the solstice rituals. Building trilithons and preparing the altar stone may assist along the way and it is vital that you keep up with the necessary preparations to avoid offending the spirits.<br/>Getting Started<br/><br/>Equipment: First Druid uses all of the pieces provided in the basic game box. Each player uses the pieces of one colour (along with the trilithon card of his or her colour), so if there are less than five players some colours will not be used.<br/><br/>Throughout these rules, the plastic figures are referred to as 'druids'.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>When the first player has moved his druid all the way around the ring, the game is at an end. Merely streaking ahead is not enough to secure victory, however; it is the support and alleigances secured along the way that decide which druid is the First Druid!<br/><br/>Each player has as many points as the number his druid piece is on at the end, plus additional points for allied tribes and spirits. Tribes and Spirits count 1 point for the first in a run, 2 for the second, 3 for the third etc.<br/><br/>So, the game is a complex balance of using your magical powers to race ahead and gaining allies. In addition, trilothon stones enhance your supply of magic, and dressing the alter stone may move you ahead or even move your rivals backwards!<br/><br/>",

Each player will attempt to establish a sector of his own while thwarting his opponent's efforts. Each player will be rewarded for the size of his sector, as well as the number of groups and bounded disks he can contain within his sector. Some players may even form more than one sector. The player with the most victory points will win the game.<br/>Getting Started<br/><br/>Equipment: Board<br/>All cards<br/>5-10 disks per player<br/><br/>For 2 players use 10 disks per player.<br/>For 3 players use 7 disks per player.<br/>For 4 players use 6 disks per player.<br/>For 5 players use 5 disks per player.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>Players earn victory points for holding sectors. A sector is a range of numbered spaces with no disks of an opponent within, and bounded by 2 of the player&rsquo;s disks. Players also score victory points for friendly disks within their sectors. Finally, players score points for groups of 2 or more of their own playing pieces in contiguous spaces.<br/><br/>The player with the most victory points wins the game.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>Sectors: Score 1 point for each numbered space of the range. A range is always the largest possible area bounded by the pieces of a single color.<br/><br/>Bounded Pieces: Score 1 point for each interior disk within a sector. Bounded pieces never define a range.<br/><br/>Groups of 2: 1 point per piece. The two pieces must be contiguous.<br/><br/>Groups of 3 or more: 2 points per piece. Groups must be contiguous.<br/><br/>Scoring Example: White has pieces in 6 night, 7 day, 9 day, 12 day, 13 night. There are no pieces belonging to opponents in any spaces between 6-13. White will score 8 points for their sector. White will score 3 points for Bounded Pieces (7, 9, 12). White will score 2 points for the group of two pieces that are contiguous (12 day &amp; 13 night). Note that 6 night and 7 day are not contiguous, and therefore do not score as a group. White scores a total of 13 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As I looked at this board, I couldn't help but think of how difficult it would be to run in circles along the tops of the stones, constantly headed inward towards the middle. Besides making you dizzy, you would have to deal with wind, rain, and perhaps huge monolithic rocks magicly moved in your way by powerful wizards. The Olympic Games of ancient Greece came to mind. Granted we still have Olympic Games, but they are much tamer than the win or die type games of the original Olympics. What if the Celts also had a version of these games. Stonehenge would make a perfect field for such a competition. Start by running along the tops of the outer ring while trying to keep your balance, especially in strong winds. Just looking at it I couldn't help but think of it as one big obstacle course that has been waiting for thousands of years to be used again. This game is the safer version of that idea.<br/><br/>Number of players: 3&ndash;5<br/><br/>Object of the game: You are a druid competing in the games. You will have to balance yourself on the outer ring, race between the two rings, hurdle the inner ring, and then push yourself to the breaking point in an attempt to be the first one to the alter.<br/><br/>Equipment: Druid Olympics uses the board, the deck, one figure for each player, one disk and one bar for each player, the trilithons, and one disk of each color.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>The game ends when a player reaches the alter stone. This player is the Grand Champion and is celebrated as a hero. The rest are sacrificed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "After reading The Wee Free Men by Terry Pratchett, it became obvious that Stonehenge was an ancient sporting arena built by clans of Scot-like fey trapped in our world. As I looked at the board, I began to wonder just what these sporting events might have looked like. I believe I've captured the strategy and excitement of those ancient contests, without quite so much mess.<br/><br/>Number of players: 2<br/><br/>Object of the game: You control a clan of kilt-wearing fair-folk at the Umpteenth Occasional Games, trying to earn awards in three events: Fightin', Drinkin', and Stealin'. The clan that gets the most awards not counting their best event wins! (You didn't really win if you got all the Killing Monsters awards but lost in Quaffing, Thieving, Not Passing Out, and Not Getting Clobbered).<br/><br/>Equipment: Fightin' an' Drinkin' an' Stealin'! uses the deck (divided into three decks), the board, all of the little colored disks, and all six of the figures.<br/><br/>Ending the Game<br/><br/>Once the seventh and final round is over, each player discards all the awards of whichever color he or she has the most of (remember that each Wee Lawyer a player has halves the value of his or her awards in that color). If two or more of a player's colors are tied, that player picks one to discard. The player with the most awards left after discarding his or her best color, wins.<br/><br/>",

The draw pile is also face up so players can have a rough idea what their opponent's hand is - and then they have to guess &quot;Will they bluff?&quot;.  As in traditional War, the players reveal a card, with the larger card revealed capturing the smaller.  The alterations in Wilcox War changes the game into a small bluffing/strategy game.<br/><br/>Base rules are for playing with two decks once through, but includes rule adjustments for playing until one person has all cards, and for single-deck games.<br/><br/>",

The referee (an impartial judge who is not spinning in the match) is the only one who wil keep track of a spinner's TOS with the sanctioned MLD Spinometer.<br/><br/>The Spin Zones are located in the middle of the Spinagogue.  They are the designated &quot;spinning areas&quot;, the only place on the spinagogue a player is permitted to spin.  A player can never intentionally spin the dreidel outside of the Spin Zone.  For MLD tournament play the Spin Zone decreases in size as rounds progress, usually every two rounds in &quot;head-to-head&quot; play depending on your bracket and every round in a &quot;total spin tournament&quot;. The Spinagogue comes with two separate spin Zones, when placed inside of the Spinagogue comes with two separate Spin Zones, when placed inside of the Spinagogue they decrease a player's spinning area, making spinning conditions more difficult.<br/> There are 3 more variations of play using different MLD Game Terrains (inserts):  Spinnings, Target Tops &amp; Hardwood Court.<br/><br/>",

There has been a two minor changes made to the Alpha Playing Cards in creating the Alpha Word Game System. The first is the addition of the marked vowels on the semi-wild vowels cards and the second is the addition of the board grid on the backs of the Alpha Playing Cards allowing the cards to be made into game boards for the tiles and dice.<br/><br/>The Alpha Word Game System and its components are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 United States License; so anyone can make their own components for the Alpha Word Game System.

Adroit placement of sugar, tobacco, gain, indigo, and coffee plantations will yield rich harvests of gold and victory points.  But watch out:  native empires and geographic barriers such as mountain ranges may confound your efforts.<br/><br/>The game is played with a deck of game cards and several kinds of tokens (all of which can be substituted with generic game components such as poker chips).  Each card represents a colony, complete with several plantations.  Players take turns &quot;discovering&quot; colonies (collecting cards), &quot;settling&quot; them (playing cards into their play area), &quot;harvesting&quot; from them (collecting VPs), and taking other actions intended to construct the most effective plantation society.  The key to the game is to place cards in such a fashion that plantations of the same time are adjacent to each other.  Harvesting from these chains of like plantations yields enormous bonuses in victory points.<br/><br/>But watch out, for there are obstacles to overcome.  Harvesting is not cheap, and players must generate the income necessary to produce.  Additionally, geographic barriers cost gold to overcome, while native empires diminish harvest chains.  And pirates lurk nearby, waiting to disrupt the plans of even the cleverest colonial planner.<br/><br/>In the end, the player who most effectively builds and harvests will win the day.<br/><br/>",

There you can roll the spesial visit die to see if Pulverheksa is home. Here you can meet the police aswell. The police give you all the cards placed on the thief house.<br/><br/>If Pulverheksa is home you can trade 3 powder for soda water, sweet bread or cake. When you got all of these you win the game.<br/><br/>Based on the childrens books by Ingunn Aamodt<br/><br/>",

To escape from the CUBE, you need memory and great luck. Sometimes the goal is right next to you, but sometimes it is too far to find.<br/><br/>This is a print and play game. The pdf includes the following components:<br/>- 36 cube cards<br/>- 6 character cards<br/>- 12 item cards<br/><br/>To set up this game, the cube cards are shuffled and arranged upside down in a 6x6 grid. Players choose a character and place the token in the start position. On a turn, a player chooses a direction in which to move and turns over the card of the entered room. If nothing happens, the player can move safely into that room. If the card shows a trap, the player must roll a specific number on a 6 sided dice to determine if the trap could be avoided. If the trap could not be avoided, damage is taken and the room is entered. At the end of each round, the dice is rolled and the grid of cards is moved according to the dice roll. The entire grid is always changing. Characters have special powers and actions.<br/><br/>The game ends when all of the players die or if one of the players finds the goal and gets out of the cube alive.<br/><br/>",

The four games included are:<br/><br/><br/>     Anti (2 players): Players try to get rid of their hands of cards playing them on the table and recognizing pairs of particle-antiparticle on the table, which annihilate themselves.<br/>     Quark Matter (any # of players): All cards are placed randomly on the table, face up, representing the primordial quark-gluon plasma. Players must be quick to grab the particles according to the correct sequence in the first moments of the universe after the Big Bang: first neutrinos, then lepton-antilepton pairs and lastly quarks and antiquarks to form baryons and mesons (which must be correctly formed). The player with most lepton-antilepton pairs and mesons and baryons is the winner.<br/>     Quark Matter Memory (any # of players): Memory-type game in which players have to find hadrons and lepton-antilepton pairs.<br/>     Find Your Higgs (any # of players): Memory-type game in which players could also search for Higgs decays.<br/><br/><br/>Rules of other games that can be played with the deck are at <a target='_blank' href=\"https://getyourhiggs.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://getyourhiggs.com</a>.<br/><br/>The game is available to buy at <a target='_blank' href=\"https://getyourhiggs.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">https://getyourhiggs.com</a>.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Kibamusha is an ancestral chess-like boardgame, from the feudal japan. There are only 2 pages of rules : it is not a complicated game. So a 9-year-old child can play Kibamusha, and even wins against an adult.<br/><br/>Kibamusha uses a gameboard of 9 rows by 10 files. Each player has 20 pieces (Ashigaru, Bowman, banner, Horse archer, etc..).<br/>There is no dice in this game.<br/><br/>Some questions :<br/><br/>I) HOW TO WIN ? <br/>In order to win, you must be the first player to place your own Bana (banner)on the opponent's first row (row 1 or  9, depending on the opponent's side).<br/><br/>II) It is my turn : what do I make ?<br/>In your turn, you have 3 options.<br/>a) Moving only 1 piece (useful if you want a fast advance for your Bana).<br/>b) Moving 2 pieces.<br/>c) Moving 3 pieces (including at least 2 Ashigarus).<br/><br/>III)CAN I TAKE (CAPTURE) OPPONENT'S PIECES ?<br/>Yes ! Except the opponent's Bana.<br/>The Bana is the most important piece : the Bana cannot be captured, and the Bana cannot capture pieces.<br/>Your goal is to threaten spaces where the bana could advance : in this way, you can prevent the opponent's bana from moving towards your own line.<br/><br/>",

Space include positive and negative dollar amounts, making this a watered down children's version of Monopoly, though there is no buying or selling involved. Occasionally cards are drawn which will augment or deplete a player's cash reserves.<br/><br/>When players amass a million dollars, they may enter the winner's circle by exact count.  The first person to get there wins.<br/><br/>Based on the original comics (as opposed to the 80's cartoon) the game is extremely rare and, outside of the first few comic book issues, has become one of the most sought-after Richie Rich collectibles.<br/><br/>",

In WTNW players take the reins of generals and command massive armies of steam driven behemoths.  In the end, the thunder that cascades across the battlefield to settle in the souls of the fighting men will only be assuaged with the assistance of the landship.<br/><br/>When the Navy Walked is the first in a series of books that will outline the story and history behind this alternate Earth, its culture and the rules for fighting massive battles.  In future supplements players will have the opportunity to play through various alternate historical scenarios, including the colonization of Africa and the deep, dark folds of the Aether.  So grab your goggles and your Aethertech and get ready for a good time filled with steam and adventure!<br/><br/>",

You have 4 lives. Every time you win a battle you win terrain. Win 4 terrain you win the game, or if all other players run out of lives before you, you win the game. People can team up on attacks/defense<br/>2) War Kings - The Duel!<br/>Kind of like a complex version of war; cards battle with various cards having different effects on the battle.<br/>3) War Kings - Enemy Attacks!<br/>Rummy variant; want to run out of cards first and score points for cards played.<br/><br/>The first game can be played by 3 to 6 players utilizing the one game deck.  The second game can be played by two using two separately purchased decks.

        "description": "The Story:  The year is 1702. As a humble bean farmer, you have grown restless and yearn for adventure. You gather your belongings, sell your farm and purchase a small sloop from the local shipyard. With entrepreneurial vigor, you set sail for the nearest island, hoping to turn a meager profit on your final barrel of beans. The leaders of your nation soon hear of your courage and petition your service. They provide you with a small satchel of gold, a crew, and Letters of Marque. As a newly commissioned privateer, you must navigate the treacherous seas, and bring home great riches and glory to your country of origin.<br/><br/>Gameplay:  A player&rsquo;s turn begins by drawing one adventure card and selecting one action card. Depending on the type of adventure, the card may be resolved immediately (e.g. a group activity), or the card may be placed on the ocean map by the player. The player then sails to an island or ocean space, choosing to either experience an adventure, or trade in the market. The market is the heart of this game. Players aim to buy low, sell high, carefully watching future prices, hoping to turn a profit. The action cards provide one-time bonuses to fight pirates, escape disasters, trade in the market, etc. Gold is used to upgrade ships, explore shipwrecks, gamble, etc. The game ends when a player&rsquo;s ship is upgraded to level 10, and victory goes to the player with the most gold.<br/><br/>",

The game comprises of artifacts in the form of 'dinosaur bone sets' or 'relics'. There is no limits of appraisal attached with these artifacts although hold minimum of one appraisal. The player can bid for these throughout the game.<br/><br/>However, the dinosaur bones have one distinct feature that each type of dinosaur, there are three bone set in the form of head, tail and torso, which are gained by players separately and if a player able to acquire all three parts of the same dinosaur, than it comprises one artifact and its value doubled.<br/><br/>The main objective of the game is to collect as many artifacts as possible along with searching for the jackpot while moving through the board. The player can gain extra appraisals and can trade, buy or auction the relics during the game. The appraisals have three level; red, blue and white. When the white appraisal exhausted, the game concludes.<br/><br/>The main strategy includes the removal of 'Fake' appraisal while comprising 'dinosaur bone artifact' as it the only time the 'fake' can be removed.

        "description": "Brouhaha is a chess variant played on on a slightly expanded 8X8 board with pairs of two additional pieces added to a standard array.<br/><br/>The extra squares 'hang' off the edges of the board, with one on each corner and two in the middle files behind the king and queen. The extra squares which 'hang' off the corners of the standard 8x8 board are special; once the piece that occupies them moves off, they may never be entered again<br/><br/>The Clerics, which should be very close in value to Rooks, start in the corner squares. The basic move is that of an ordinary Bishop, but with the additional ability to leap exactly two squares horizontally or vertically.<br/><br/>The two Scouts start behind the king and queen and are very close in value to Knights and Bishops. The scout may step one square horizontally or vertically, or leap exactly three squares horizontally or vertically. Also, a Scout that has not moved yet this game has the added ability to move (once) like a Knight<br/><br/>",

Want to play with microscopes, chemicals, and heavy machinery? No training required! Want to make exciting new discoveries and propose revolutionary scientific theories? Welcome to The Game of Science, where you can do all this and more--in an hour or less.<br/><br/>The game moves forward as you hire new scientists and outfit them with the tools of their trade. You'll use your scientists and equipment to make discoveries, which give you science credits (credibility and prestige, the currency of the trade). Your scientists can also mess with the research of other players as you compete with them to accumulate the most scientific credibility. And finally, you'll use your accumulated credibility to propose theories, the key to winning the  game.<br/><br/>But the fun isn't over yet. Now the challenge is to convince your fellow players that you can use your theories to explain something new about the world. If they believe you, they'll let you win--but if they're not convinced, one of them might steal the show!<br/><br/>Every game will be different, as you explore new ways to combine scientists and decide on your favorite theories.  No two games will play out the same!<br/><br/>The Game of Science is educational as well as fun. It was developed by scientists using real scientific concepts and experiences. We wanted to share the excitement, adventure, and humor of the day-to-day life of a modern scientist.<br/><br/>The game developers are also active in science outreach and education. If you are a teacher interested in using this game in your classroom, we would love to hear from you to share ideas and experiences.<br/><br/>",

The box is nice, shaped like a treasure chest, and the map comes rolled up with a ribbon round it.<br/>The board is map of the sea between Sail Point Bay and Treasure Bay, superimposed with squares. The game uses dice but in a novel way. Turn order is decided by chance and that order of play continues for the whole game. We will call the first player 'the Leader'. He throws a red die and consults the compass at the top of the board. There are 6 compass points and each points in a different direction. The number rolled dictates the direction of movement, for all players, this round. Then the Leader throws a black die and moves his ship that many spaces in the correct direction. Each player after that does the same, throw the black die and move, but not the red die as that is only thrown at the start of the round. There is a little choice in movement. You can decide to 'tack' and move in the direct opposite direction of the compass throw, but you don't move so far, in fact, you might not move at all.<br/>There are perils to be avoided, like rocks or the dreaded Seaweed Sea where you just float randomly until clear of it.<br/>The first player to sail into Treasure Bay wins.<br/><br/>",

Each miniature represents a single soldier or artillery piece and the rules provide for officer ranks, command and control, and campaign development of individual soldiers through heroic actions. The rules we're written primarly for 15mm miniatures but can easily be used with 5mm-25mm.<br/><br/>",

Fortunately, as you EVANGELIZE, you church's membership will grow numerically.  But, unfortunately you will soon discover that your church is composed not only of SPIRITUAL and CARNAL members, but also of HYPOCRITES.  On the other hand, your church can grow spiritually as you DISCIPLE these same members from HYPOCRITES to CARNAL and also from CARNAL to SPIRITUAL.<br/><br/>Along the way you will encounter CIRCUMSTANCES which, depending upon the presence or absence of SPIRITUAL GIFTS in your church, will either help or hinder your overall growth.<br/><br/>But sooner or later on one of the CIRCUMSTANCE cards, the RAPTURE will appear.  (Guaranteed to get a rise out of everybody).  Suddenly the game ends; and the SPIRITUALITY of your church is weighed in the balance (in this game, by a point system.  Will your church be found wanting... more points?)  The church with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>Definitions:  Whats the RAPTURE?  Something to get all up in the air about, and the point at which the game ends.<br/><br/>Whats the Church?  Another good question.  We've been debating it for years.  For our purposes, in RAPTURE there are no buildings -- just people.<br/><br/>What are SPIRITUAL GIFTS?  A part of this game and the REAL one.  There are over 20 listed in the Bible, we've selected 7 for this game.<br/><br/>Whats the difference between a CARNAL and SPIRITUAL member?  See 1 Corinthians 3:1-3.<br/>---<br/><br/>The game is a roll and move type game with different things happening based on the different spaces the player lands on.<br/><br/>",

The players must expend and earn Ideas, Knowledge and Material by building inventions.  Possible inventions are determined by turning over cards in rounds, and the player must choose which invention to build in each turn.  If, by the end of the three rounds of the game, the team has earned enough of these three commodities to build a University, they win the game.<br/><br/>Because it is non-competitive, it can also be easily played by fewer than 3 people, if one player wants to play more than one character.  In addition, the commodity targets can be lowered to make the game easy to win, for young children.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A feeding frenzy for two bunnies.<br/><br/>This is a simple fishing game of capturing cards off the tableau. The game starts with an 8x3 grid of cards face up on the table.  After splitting the undealt cards (using a split the pie mechanism) the players capture cards by playing one or more cards whose rank adds up equal or higher than the card being captured.  Each of the capturing cards must share a suit with the card being taken. After the tableau is cleared, the players add up the values of their captured cards to determine the winner.<br/><br/>Even though the game was designed as a light game, it is almost completely a perfect information game.  The only moment where there is not perfect information is when the players determine the split of the hand -- and even then they can figure out which cards the opponent is splitting.  As such it could be played as a very memory heavy, intense, spatial game.<br/><br/>The game was inspired by the designer's pet rabbit who is by far the most enthusiastic and fastest eating bunny the designer has ever seen. The girl has no problems yanking food right out of her partner's mouth, but is readily aggrieved if she does not get her fair share of the produce.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher Blurb:<br/><br/>Welcome to CampAntics, the board game of summer camp adventures, mischief, activities, and lots of social interaction. If you&rsquo;re curious about summer camps, or have already been to one, you&rsquo;ll love this game!<br/><br/>CampAntics is primarily for children from 7 to 14 years of age. The summer camp theme is also very attractive to older children, parents, and grandparents. Each trip around the board is one, very realistic day at camp. Campers decide how many days to play, and enjoy a social experience like no other. During a camper&rsquo;s stay at CampAntics, points are won and lost with the ups and downs of daily life at a great summer camp. Each space on the board relates to an activity that you would do at camp.  Some spaces will reward you for an activity and others will penalize you for let&rsquo;s say... throwing a water balloon.  You roll dice to move and each trip around the board is a day at camp.  You choose the number of days based on level of play. The winner is the camper with the most points (acorns) at the end of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Pyjamaparty players are little vampires who are flitting from bed to bed at night instead of sleeping. Yes, you might think that vampires should be roaming the halls late at night, but junior vampires need their sleep as much as non-vampiric youngsters.<br/><br/>To set up the game, each player places her bed tile next to the rug on the game board of the same color, then places her pawn on a rug that is not her own color. Someone shuffles the six garlic cards and places them face-down on the game board, then players mix the spider and orange juice drink tokens face-down, place them on the game board, then draw one at random and place them on their bed.<br/><br/>On a turn, a player rolls the die. If she rolls a number, she moves that many spaces clockwise or counter-clockwise on the rugs on the edge of the game board. If she lands on an empty space, her turn ends. If one or more players are already on that rug, she chooses one of them, then draws a face-down token and places it before her without looking at it. The chosen player draws and reveals another token. Each player then makes what they think is the appropriate noise for these two items hitting one another: &quot;clink&quot; if two glasses, &quot;oomph&quot; if two spiders, and &quot;splash&quot; if one of each. The active player reveals the hidden token: If both players were correct, they each claim one token and place it on their bed; if only one player was correct, she claims both tokens; and if no one was right, the tokens are placed face-down on the board again.<br/><br/>If the player rolls a garlic bulb, everyone screams &quot;Garlic!&quot; then tries to get in bed because their screaming probably roused Dad, who will be annoyed to find them out of bed. Here's how this works: The active player reveals the top garlic card. If it shows a closed trap door, then each player moves one rug toward their bed (or onto their bed if they are already on their rug). If all vampires are in bed, stop turning over cards; if not, turn another card. If Dad shows up on one of the cards, every vampire out of bed loses an item while vampires in bed may take an item as a reward.<br/><br/>When a player has eight items on bed, players hold a garlic round. If this player reaches bed before Dad arrives, she wins; if not, she loses an item and the game continues. Note that one or more players can receive their eighth item as a bonus at the end of a garlic round. In this case, these players immediately win as they're already in bed!<br/><br/>",

It's broken into six categories: History/Geography, Big Bucks, Politics, Sports, Entertainment and PhD.<br/><br/>The game is very hard, even for long time Chicagoans. The questions are extremely difficult to begin with and you can lose category chips for wrong answers in some situations, including the last question to win which your opponents get to choose.<br/><br/>",

The brass said that they would be coming with that large a concentration of living people but I don't think even they had a clue how many there would be in that first wave.  We weren't worried, though.  I mean we had everything that the Army could provide.  We had guns, composite body armor, soldier-to-soldier networking with real-time satellite image feeds.  They pulled out all the stops. <br/><br/><br/><br/>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it meant diddly.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This wasn't an enemy that we needed to hunt down in an urban environment or a stand up fight with another military.  This was a feeding frenzy, pure and simple.  All our toys and gadgets, training and preparation, hadn't prepared anyone to fight an enemy like this.  We had to relearn everything and fast.  No more shots to center mass.  No more munitions designed to injure and disable.<br/><br/><br/><br/>        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we did it.  Between us regular grunts and the civs that fought beside us, we kept the zeds back long enough to build the wall around the settlement.  That gave us a safe place to stay as well as a launching point and supply depot.  From there, we took back the world from those stinking corpses.<br/>        -- Sgt. Larry Winslow, retired, on the battle of Settlement 15<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Zed Force is a solitaire hex-chit wargame.  You must hold against the hordes of the undead while engineers complete the wall around one of the remaining human settlements.  Uses a combination of standard dice rolling and chit-pull.  Instead of simply fighting the undead, you must also manage your limited resources and choose when to call for reinforcements, when to focus on building the wall, and when to develop new tactics for this completely unforeseen enemy.<br/><br/>",

Six barriers are placed in predetermined positions on the board. Each player has two playing pieces and places them off the board next to his bases. He has 3 sets of tiles each set consisting of five tiles, one each of lenght 2 to 6 but only has access to one set at the start of the game.<br/> On the first turn each player in turn places one of his tiles orthogonally such that it covers his home base and no other home base, and moves his playing piece onto the far end of that tile. On subsequent turns a player may start building from his other base or continue from where he has got to by playing a tile that must link up by overlapping at least one square side with his existing tiles. The connected playing piece is moved to the free end of this tile. However, each tile played MUST be longer than the last played tile and players must play if they can legally do so. Each time a player is forced to pass, the next player gets a free move which consists of one of:<br/> Move a barrier, move his playing piece onto or along another player's track or lay any length tile he chooses. As soon as one player runs out of tiles, all players take their next set.<br/> The first player to bring his two playing pieces to orthoganally adjacent squares is the winner but if one player runs out of tiles then the player with his playing pieces the closest together wins.<br/><br/>",

Some squares offer photo opportunities which yield money; others force a player to take a detour or lose moves. The goal is to reach the end of the track and return. Once a player has returned to the start those still on the track begin to lose money for each move, so the winner is not necessarily the player who moves the fastest or takes the most photos.<br/><br/>",

Welt des Automobils (World of Cars) is a quiz game with 600 questions about car models, car manufacturers, advertising slogans and technology.<br/><br/>In each round, one player reads the question on a card, followed by the five possible answers. Unlike most other trivia games, the number of correct answers to the question ranges from one to five, but players don't know how many answers are correct. After reading through the answers once, the player reads them again one by one. Players secretly decide whether they think an answer is correct, hiding one of their answer tokens in hand if they think it is. Players reveal their guesses simultaneously, then place their tokens on the numbered answer card.<br/><br/>After players have guessed on all five answers, the correct answers are revealed, and the players may move forward on the scoring track:<br/><br/>     If a player has placed one or more tokens on incorrect answers, he does not move on the scoring track.<br/>     If a player has placed tokens only on correct answers, he moves forward a number of spaces equal to the number of (correct) answers he selected.<br/><br/><br/>After an agreed-upon number of questions, the game ends, and the player who is furthest on the scoring track wins.<br/><br/>",

Reds uses some interesting mechanics, including an anti-trump suit which will almost always lose a trick, bidding which encourages risk-taking and rewards skill, and variable exchange of cards which leads the game through several different stages of luck and strategy.<br/><br/>Called &quot;Reds&quot; due to diamonds being trump, this is an interesting use of a three-suited deck.<br/><br/>Each round is 5 tricks, and each game is 9 rounds.  The deal is a straight rotation, moving clockwise every round.  Each round, players bid before a pre-determined amount of cards in their hand are passed to another player.  This allows for interesting strategy and even an element of bluffing.  As the game wraps up, fewer and fewer cards are passed, lending the game a transition from heavily luck-based to heavily skill-based.<br/><br/>Playable with a standard deck (hearts removed), a pad, and a pencil.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game covers almost every aspect of a cycling race. It features rules for ascension, sprint, time trial (even a different rule for mountain time trial), and provides mechanism to run a single race.<br/><br/>The board is customisable with the provided little arrows.  It is just a plain 100-field board.Before the race you must decide how long will it be (recommended: 150 to 250 squares long for a one-day race, that is one and a half to two and a half laps) and where you place the different mountains and sprints.<br/><br/>What is puzzling is that you have to remember (and possibly write down) in which lap are placed the mountains. In effect, it is recommended to have three climbs during the race, and each climb takes place in a different lap. The same applies to special sprints. So you end up with a board with too many arrow pointing at mountains and sprints that might or might not be there.<br/>We have six national teams  of 5 riders each, and every rider has different abilities which affect the probability of having a good throw on a given type of road. As you can see in the team cards, riders have values for flat road (LL = &quot;llano&quot;), mountain (M), sprint (S), time trial (CR = &quot;contra reloj&quot;) and mountain time trial (CRM).<br/><br/>On an even closer look, you will guess that good values is the lower one (9) for flat roads (LL) and the higher for mountains sprints and time trials. This is because in flat road riders throw two dice and they have an extra throw if they match their number on the team card (and of course, it is more probable to throw 9 than 12 with two dice, though when you get an extra throw after a double sic, you really advance a lot)<br/><br/>The mountain rule is quite strange. You still throw two dice, but you only advance the value of the blue one. The red dice is just added to the blue to see if you match the number on the card and you have an extra throw.<br/><br/>Similar rules apply to sprint and time trial. Just roll and move. No decisions to be taken. The only strategic issue in the game is the demarrage card. One is given to each player, to be used only once during the race, and giving you an extra throw for one rider. <br/>The game is intended to run a full season, so we have special maillots (yellow, green and rainbow jerseis) medals and a trophy, and rules to decide how many points is worth a given race. <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Numenko board game resembles Scrabble in that players have wooden tiles and lay valid combinations of tiles in horizontal and vertical rows, sometimes reusing tiles on the board in their current plays.<br/><br/>What differs is that the tiles in Numenko feature digits (0-9), a Multichoice symbol (that stands for the player's choice of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division or &quot;is equal to&quot;), and a Freechoice symbol (that can be a digit or Multichoice).<br/><br/>Each player starts with eight tiles on his rack. On a turn, a player plays one or more tiles to the game board (possibly using tiles already in play) to create a valid equation, with the operators being resolved left to right or top to bottom, except for division which always takes place first. A Multichoice or Freesymbol tile can be used as a new operator or number if a player adds tiles to an existing equation. If a player places tiles adjacent to tiles already on the board, he does not have to create a valid equation (unlike Scrabble in which each multiletter combination must be a valid word). The sum or product of a player's equation is that player's score for the round; if any part of the equation's answer covers a &quot;D&quot; on the game board, that player's score for the round is doubled. The player then refills his hand to eight tiles.<br/><br/>Instead of playing tiles, a player can swap any number of tiles from his hand for new tiles or simply pass.<br/><br/>When one player has no tiles and the bag is empty &ndash; or when all players pass in succession &ndash; the game ends, and the player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

It moves fast while retaining the excitement of the longer 18xx variants. However, with four players, one person is left without a railroad to operate.

At the beginning of the game, all the cards are placed face-up on the table, then the dice are rolled. Three of the dice (colored blue, red and yellow) show different numbers ranging from 1 to 18. The fourth die shows three &quot;up&quot; arows and three &quot;down&quot; arrows. If the &quot;up&quot; arrow is rolled, the players should consult the code card that matches the highest die rolled; otherwise they should consult the card that matches the lowest die rolled.<br/><br/>The code card shows a puzzle that uses the remaining two dice, specifically a table that involves some calculation with the numbers to find the right loot. After a player has determined the correct loot, he takes the corresponding card from the table. If he has picked the right card, he gets to place the card in front of himself. The first player to collect five cards wins.<br/><br/>",

Presented in a bright red box, this set was many millions of players&rsquo; first introduction to D&amp;D.<br/><br/>In the Player&rsquo;s Book was a short &lsquo;pick-a-path&rsquo; style adventure designed to teach you the basics of the game. Taking on the role of a brave warrior you set off to explore a dark and dangerous dungeon. But it was not long before you found yourself in trouble and were wounded after a brief battle with a nasty goblin.<br/><br/>Just when things were looking grim you met Aleena! The beautiful and kindly cleric (wonderfully illustrated by legendary artist, Larry Elmore) gladly used her powers to heal your injuries. With Aleena now by your side you continued deeper into the dungeon, only to encounter the infamous magic-user, Bargle!<br/><br/>The rest, as they say, is history...<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>Kill Bargle is a dice game offering 2-5 players the opportunity to exact their revenge upon Bargle.  The only requirements are the free rules, some players, 6 rusty nails and a set of polyhedral dice.

Try to find them based on their silhouetted profiles before the other players do &ndash; but that's not easy as the insect marked through on your search card must not be anywhere on the insect card!<br/><br/>The 63 insect cards feature three colored insects (all different) on one side of the card and three silhouetted insects on the reverse side, with one of those insects having a large X through it. Shuffle the deck with the black-and-white images face up, then deal one card to each player; this card is a player's search card.<br/><br/>On a turn, the player who last claimed a card (chosen randomly in the first round) flips over the top card of the deck. Each player races to slap this card &ndash; but only if the newly revealed card depicts at least one of the two non-Xed insects on that player's search card and that player's Xed insect is not on the newly revealed card. If the first player to slap the card has done so correctly, he claims the card, placing it black-and-white side up on his stack to become his new search card; if the first player has slapped the card incorrectly (as his Xed insect is on the card or neither of his other two search targets are present), that player must remove the bottom card of his search stack from the game. The slapped card is also removed from play. (A player can't lose his only search card. If no one slaps the card, remove it from play, then reveal the next card.)<br/><br/>Play continues until the final insect card has been slapped. Whoever has the most cards in his search deck wins.<br/><br/>For children as young as age three, Marienk&auml;fer und so can be played with players taking turns consecutively instead of playing simultaneously. If a player can claim a card, he does so, making it his new search card; otherwise he removes it from play.<br/><br/>A second game is included in Marienk&auml;fer und so. Shuffle the insect cards black-and-white side face up, then deal seven cards to each player. All players simultaneously flip their top card color-side up onto the table, then race to slap an insect card in front of another player that matches the search criteria on the newly revealed top card of their personal deck. Each card can be claimed by only one player, i.e., whoever slaps it first. If a player slaps a card correctly, he places it on the bottom of his deck black-and-white side face up; if a player slaps a card incorrectly, his current search card is removed from play. All unslapped cards are also removed from play. The game ends when one or more players have only a single card in their deck; the player(s) with the most cards in their deck(s) wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Race game with some novel twists.<br/>The track on the board takes you on a journey to England. 18 picture cards are shuffled and placed face down on numbered circles at the top of the board. On your journey, should you land on the same numbered square as one of the circles above, you take the face-down picture card. This card is a souvenir of your trip and will score the points indicated. Only the first player to arrive at a square that is linked to a circle above, can take the picture card.<br/>The first player to reach England gains 10 points. Now everyone counts up the points on their souvenir cards and the player with the most points, wins.<br/>One unusual rule. If you arrive home with the Slave-Girl (souvenir?!) cannot arrive in England with such a find. It must be returned to the board and he can choose any other souvenir card that is still unowned. England would appear to be the only country in Europe that bans slaves! By the way, if you want a Slave-Girl of your own, the place to go is Istanbul (square 65).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In #OccupyBoardwalk, players take the role of the 1% trying to retain control of the board against increasing demonstrations against their rule. The goal is to be the player with the most money at the end of the game, assuming the 99% don&rsquo;t successfully occupy too much of your precious property! If that happens, everyone loses.<br/><br/><br/>    OccupyBoardwalk is an Uncooperative Game for 3 or More Players. It just requires a copy of Monopoly and a book. (It can be any book, but we suggest Das Capital, Road to Serfdom or a pocket copy of the Constitution).  <br/><br/><br/>Each round, the public expects the 1% to pay another 1000 dollars of your fortunes towards the public good. To do this, the player with the Top Hat opens the book to a page an puts any amount of money into the book secretly. They then flip to another page and pass the book to the next player. When a player gets the book, they can&rsquo;t flip backwards in the book to see what other players have payed. Once each player has had an opportunity to put money into the book, the first player turns the book over and shakes it over the board. Collect the money that falls out, count it and put it under public parking.<br/><br/>Remember two things: The player with the most money left at the end of the game wins. Also, the public expects the 1% to pay another $1000 every turn. So the expectations of the public about the amount of money in public parking increases every turn. There are a few other twists and turns involving the removal of protestors from properties, and the use of Chance and Community Chest cards to get bailed out when things get rough. The full rules are available in the attachments or at the link provided in the link section<br/><br/>",

It uses a standard eight by eight square board and just about any miniature figures, pawns or markers, to denote the individual units. The Basic game is simple, and there are Advanced rules to increase the complexity for seasoned players. There are also over two dozen additional scenarios to add replayability and fun to the game. An additional section explains ways to use the game within your roleplaying game as well. This game is complete and includes Basic Game Rules, Advanced Game Rules, over two dozen Alphabetized Scenarios, dozens of paper miniatures and markers.  The game is offered as a downloadable PDF file. <br/>As first glance Lurch! is a fairly simple game &ndash; ironically more so than mainstream chess &ndash; as all of the zombies (playing pieces) are identical, and each piece can only undertake one of four possible moves (though you can move up to three pieces per turn). There is a way to make your basic zombie into a clever zombie, which is the equivalent of getting a pawn turned into a queen, but that&rsquo;s about it&hellip;except there's more.<br/><br/>If the above sounds simple, then rest assured that it is, but that&rsquo;s also just the foundation of the game. The beauty of Lurch! is that it&rsquo;s highly customizable, so much so that the book not only presents three different advanced rules, but also twenty-six &ldquo;scenarios&rdquo; each of which are also variant ways to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Focus is a game that children have fun playing.  It is structured to encompass the essential elements of behavior modification and designed to have the greatest positive impact on attention.  In behavior modification children receive specific positive reinforcement for accomplishing a task within an appropriate time frame and without being distracted.  The rewards are usually in the form of tokens.  This game provides two ways for players to win tokens &ndash; with or without a distraction.<br/><br/>The game has 3 sets of task cards that describe tasks that the players have to complete in order to earn their tokens.  Each task requires concentration and continuing attention and includes:<br/><br/>1.  Categories:  Players have to list things that belong in a specific category, such as listing five fruits that have one large pit in the middle.<br/><br/>2.  Forward and Back:  Players have to recite things forward and/or backwards, such as reciting the alphabet forwards and backwards from A to F.<br/><br/>3.  Problem Solving:  The game comes with various cut out shapes and cut out words.  Using shapes, the players have to create a specific design, like a triangle similar to the pattern on the card, using the shapes provided.  Using words the players have to create a sentence, like a sentence in which someone throws something to someone else.<br/><br/>A player can elect to perform the task without distraction and win one token or with distraction and win two tokens.  The distraction is optional.  The distractions are provided by one of the other players, who pick a Distraction card.  This card may ask the distracting player to hum &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; or tap fingers on the table while the other player is trying to accomplish the task.  Players can earn more tokens when they attempt a task while distracting events are taking place.  Distractions are the most common reason people lose focus on the task at hand.  This game gives players much needed practice that improves their ability to stay focused on tasks, even with distractions.<br/><br/>There are both competitive and cooperative versions for grades 1-12.  There are three decks of Task cards with varied levels of difficulty: easier, regular, and challenge.  The key is for the players to be able to complete the task most of the time if they concentrate and are not distracted.  Difficulty of the tasks can also be varied by imposing a time limit and permitting the use of paper and pencil for certain tasks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Starzone is a print-and-play game for 2 players set in outer space. Each player battles with a fleet of spacecraft by flicking coins into the Starzone target. The Starzone target is made up of different zones, and asteroids which litter space.  Which zone you hit determines which action you take: you can repair your spacecraft, activate your shields, add or destroy asteroids on the target, or damage your opponent's spacecraft. A special Zone Shift zone on the target allows you to change which actions can be activated by hitting each zone, adding a tactical element to the game. Your spacecraft has different sectors, and the health of each sector is given by hit points. When one sector is destroyed then your spacecraft is destroyed. The first player to destroy three of their enemy's fleet wins the game.<br/><br/>Starzone is a fun and furious game of dexterity and strategy. Outwit your opponent using asteroids and zone-shifts. Find your enemy's weak spot and flick it into outer space!<br/><br/>",

After making 'three in a row' a player removes an enemy piece which is adjacent to either side of this row (that's another difference to Dara).

When shares are bought or sold the price goes up or down one unit on the central gameboard for every block of shares traded. As the share price changes players attempt to buy low and sell high in order to make the most profit.<br/><br/>In the advanced game players can expand their possibilities - take out loans and put options. Various random events, such as market trends are also introduced through the use of event cards.<br/><br/>What adds a little fun is the fact, that you can decide what actions you will take with the different results...<br/>Winner is the first player to amass 1.000.000 credits.<br/><br/>",

Two decks are the minimum required for play. Six decks maximize the experience.<br/><br/>Each card, designed by Beth Queman, represents a vehicle, (tank, half-track, armored car, truck) infantry or calvary squad, AT gun and crew, special equipment (like a Panzerfaust), terrain type and special events. There are a total of 164 different card types in 3 different levels of rarity. There's some minor card errata (nothing serious) and a list of all types on Web-Grognards. Each card has a color picture, short description, and different numbers representing game factors.<br/><br/>",

The first player throws the dice and moves his mouse in an anti-clockwise direction and up the track of his colour to the table where he collects a piece of cheese and tries to return with this to his own Mouse-hole without being caught by the Cat who stalks the outside track. If your Mouse is trapped by the Cat he must go to the Cat's basket and he is out of the game. It's fast and furious fun especially when all your Mice have been caught ... and you take control of the Cat.

Man&rsquo;s two previous wars to end war never truly solved the problem. This time, the weapons are much larger and more destructive. The ruling nuclear powers have decided that Earth is only large enough for one of them; they consider shared power a waste of time. Resources grow scarce; diplomats and the U.N. have failed. Your power can only survive to lead humanity by eliminating all other powers that stand in its way.  Speed of launch is life or death.<br/><br/>Rocket Die is primarily a dice (or die, rather) game for 3-6 players. Each player controls a nuclear-capable nation of the future, called a power. Each turn is divided into three phases:  deployment (aiming weapons at other powers), roll out (cycling repeatedly to decide which power will launch) and launch (validating and executing the launch, damaging other powers).  The goal is for your power to be the first to initiate launch each turn, since only one power gets to launch per turn.  The game ends when all players but one are eliminated.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Halloween Dice comes with a set of big orange-and-black six-siders, with custom Jack o' Lantern designs on each face. Your goal: roll those dice and try to reach the lucky total of 13. (Normally 13 is considered an unlucky number, but for Halloween, when darkness and otherworldly things are celebrated, luck stands on its head.)<br/><br/>On a turn, you choose one, two, or three dice and receive respectively $2, $5, or $9, with money being represented by tokens. You then roll those dice. If the sum on the dice equals 13, you end your turn and keep the money you collected. If the total is less than 13, you can stop and pay $1 times the difference between your sum and 13, or you can again choose 1-3 dice (receiving more money) and roll again, adding the newly rolled sum to your previous sum. You again face the same options of stopping or choosing more dice and rolling again. If your sum goes over 13, however, your turn ends and you pay $2 times the difference between your sum and 13!<br/><br/>The player with the most money after three rounds wins.<br/><br/>",

In keeping with this concept, the cards in Fungibility (the card game) are all identical copies of the same card.<br/><br/>To create some degree of randomness, the deck is shuffled, first with half the cards rotated, then a second time with half the cards flipped face-up. The facing, position, and even rotational orientation of cards relative to each player's seating position has a logically distinct meaning within the game, meaning that the same card in the supply may have completely different meanings to each player.<br/><br/>The basic game is free to print and play. It is the author's intent that, should the game be published and sold at retail, the retail cards would include art elements unreferenced by the core rules. As of writing, the author has three expansions designed, each of which would merely describe rules for the unreferenced art elements, and which would be made available free of charge, post release.<br/><br/>",

Two games are described using these cards.<br/><br/>Frisky Families is a Happy Families game. 52 cards were issued, in 13 sets of four. Each set of four is attributed to a different animal. Frisky himself, is card no 1 and he is a rabbit. The game play is similar to other set collecting games. In his turn, a player may ask another player for a certain card. If that player has such a card, he must hand it over. The turn can now be extended by asking for another card, and so on. When you have a set of four, you may lay it in front of you. After all 13 sets have been collected, the player with the most sets, wins.<br/><br/>Game 2 is just called Frisky.<br/><br/>This is a trick-taking game. In effect, you play with 52 cards, all in one suit, and the higher card is most likely to take the trick. The cards are ranked 2 to 52. Card 1, Frisky' is the highest card though and will always win the trick in which he is played. After all the cards have been played, the player with the most cards in tricks, wins.<br/><br/>The original game was published in 1935. Since then, there has been at least one reproduction set.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the back of the Book<br/>It was during World War II that the aircraft truly evolved into a state of the art military weapon, far out-shadowing its not inconsiderable achievements of the previous war. The citizens of every nation were already living in dread of the bomber, and its promise to rain death down upon the cities in which they lived with impunity &ndash; that nightmare was now a reality.<br/><br/>From the outset of the war, Germany demonstrated just how lethal aircraft could be when used in conjunction with infantry and armour. Indeed, this was the very cornerstone of Blitzkrieg. However, aircraft evolved into weapon delivery platforms in their own right. For the first time, ship-launched attack aircraft could destroy vessels far beyond the visual range of their parent carrier, as demonstrated first by the Royal Navy at Taranto, then at Pearl Harbour by Japan, and finally by US forces as they hopped across the islands of the Pacific.<br/><br/>Heavy bombers pounded cities and factories throughout the war, but the dreams commanders had of aircraft being able to win wars proved to be mislead. A population bombarded did not automatically result in a breakdown of national morale &ndash; quite the opposite. Also, technology evolved to counter bomber attacks, from the dogged defence of the British Isles during the Battle of Britain, to the sophisticated layered defences of Germany against the thousand bomber raids.<br/><br/>On the battlefield, the importance of air superiority became apparent, with the dominant force claiming the skies. Once enemy aircraft had been chased from the battlefield, fighter bombers used cannon, bomb and rocket to annihilate ground forces. Even mighty tanks were fodder for the Stuka, Thunderbolt and Typhoon.<br/><br/>Infantry and armour were still needed to wage war and take ground. The addition of aircraft made their task either a great deal easier or far more difficult, depending on how their pilots fared in the air.<br/><br/>This book contains aircraft from every period of the war, for every military force featured in Battlefield Evolution: World at War. Each aircraft has been painstakingly researched, and includes upgrades throughout the war, and multiple payload options, guaranteeing you will find a use for all the weapons included in your average aircraft kit!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Pyramid Shambo is tournament-style Rock Paper Scissors (aka Roshambo), with pyramids used as scoring chips. Pyramid Shambo is to RPS what a Texas Hold &lsquo;em Tournament is to a single hand of classic poker.<br/><br/>Each player in turn challenges another to a round of Roshambo, with the loser paying the winner a small pyramid, making change as necessary based on pip counts.  Every time there's a tie, the payout escalates and the players continue to throw until there's a winner.  A player gets a bonus for eliminating another, and the eliminated player's pyramids are removed from the game.  The last player standing wins.<br/><br/>This was made available on the Looney Labs web site late in 2011 as the company's holiday gift to fans, presumably as a revision of the 2009 gift Nothing Beats a Large.<br/><br/>Also included in Pyramid Arcade.<br/><br/>",

The players control froads (or is that togs?), creatures which are never quite sure whether they are hopping frogs or walking toads. The froads need to escape from their current environment which they do by racing down two spiraling roads  to the exits, collecting bonus tokens on the way.<br/><br/>In each round of the game players first select the actions their froads will take from a shopping list of available actions. Then they move their froads. Depending on the situation, players will find that some actions are better than others, but each action may only be selected once in a round, so players scramble to select what they think will be their best actions, whilst second guessing what the other players will do.<br/><br/>Some actions that players may select change the settings of the game &ndash; who selects first and moves first, and what the criterion is for earning bonus move tokens. Other actions move your froads with hops or walks, forwards or backwards (going backwards allows you to pick up bonus move tokens). There are even actions that cause both of your froads to move.<br/><br/>There are effectively two separate races, and the winner of the game is the first player to get both of his froads to the end of their roads.<br/><br/>",

Two teams are at a standoff: the aliens steal the boy scouts during the &ldquo;night&rdquo; phase of the game, and the boy scouts vote to eliminate one player during each of the &ldquo;day&rdquo; phases in an attempt to neutralize the aliens. The game develops diplomatic skills as well as analytical and deductive thinking. Based on the widely known game Mafia, Aliens vs. Boy Scouts offers a different plot together with expanded gaming abilities. The game has a number of advantages over its free print-n-play prototype:<br/><br/>- originally illustrated cards <br/>- new gaming elements: &ldquo;objects&rdquo; and &ldquo;events&rdquo;<br/>- a different environment: one without murder and criminal activity <br/>- other useful materials: a referee chart and voting tokens<br/><br/>",

There are new hexes, including colorful Nebulas, deadly Pulsars, and Supernovae that trigger a special &ldquo;Non-Planet&rdquo; scoring round, bringing research tokens and credits into play even faster. Also, there rumors abound of mysterious derelict spaceships from a long forgotten alien race that allow you to get both research and credits from exploring them..<br/><br/>Along with new hexes is a new Nanotech! There&rsquo;s the Asynchronous Data Converter which allows you change unused AP for a turn into Credits on a 1:1 basis. Autonomous Robots allow your placed Robots to move about the board by themselves without your Ship! The Stellar Cartographer lets you draw two Space Tiles (instead of one) at beginning of your Turn. The Really, Really Big Bomb or TRRBB as it is lovingly called by many, has a dual function. It can be used to destroy Monsters, but the other, more useful evil use of the TRRBB is to eradicate relocate all of the robots on a planet.<br/><br/>Another exciting new feature is the addition of Faction Cards.

The game board has a unique, abstract style: images of keys, suns, and moons are set alongside pictures of dragons and other fantastical monsters.<br/><br/>The Gate is essentially a race to the center of the board. Players compete with each other as they advance through three levels of spaces arranged in concentric rings. The first player to the Gate wins. At the start of the game, each player chooses an identity from five different player types: Creature, Dwarf, Elf, Sorcerer, and Warrior. Players roll dice and play cards as they move clockwise around the board. In order to advance to a higher level, one must circle the level, acquire a key card, and defeat a monster. Throughout the game, players encounter a variety of enemies and use fighting dice and weapon cards to combat them. Players also battle each other using dice and cards. The advanced game employs additional cards as well as special fighting and moving dice.<br/><br/>The game box includes both the beginner and advanced versions. It contains one 28&quot; x 24&quot; game board, 333 cards (beginner and advanced decks), 8 metal pieces, 10 custom dice (beginner and advanced), 82 glass pebbles (used as currency), several rule cards, and a &quot;scroll&quot; card with the story of The Gate.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to capture eight of the opponent's units. One player is black and the other is red.<br/><br/>Units are moved with a combination of movement cards and movement pyramids. Players choose movement cards each round and then place movement pyramids on the cards. A card can have any number of pyramids placed on it, but the pip count of the pyramids can't exceed the number on the card.<br/><br/>Players take turns during each round placing movement pyramids and moving units. When a pyramid is placed on a card, any one unit or stack that contains a unit of that size is able to move. Up to two units can be in a stack at one time, but a stack can not be broken once it is formed. Each unit and unit stack type moves differently, for a total of six different movement patterns.<br/><br/>Movement options early in the game are limited. As more enemy units are captured, however, players gain access to additional movement cards and can use the captured enemy units as movement pyramids.<br/><br/>",

Each player is tasked to help build a great city, while trying to tailor it towards your Agenda and Occupation. Featuring a blocky 16-bit art style coming with over 100 cards and a quick to learn rule set making it easy for the whole family and friends to learn and play!<br/><br/><br/>Excerpt from the rules:<br/><br/>Welcome, rich sucker wise investor! As a new majority shareholder in the company, this orientation tour will teach you the basics of running a multinational conglomerate successfully. By the time we&rsquo;re done with you, you&rsquo;ll have the ability to shape the company&rsquo;s direction as we expand into the city of Metropolitia and absolutely will not be a figurehead whose pocket we&rsquo;re picking. Definitely not. Perish the thought.<br/><br/>Moving right along, I suppose you&rsquo;d like a tour of the place? Given that you control it, that seems pretty reasonable. Well, here we go then&hellip;<br/>90 City Building Cards <br/>6 occupation cards <br/>6 agenda cards <br/>6 Headlines <br/>1 Rules Sheet <br/>1 Tuckbox<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s a fair haul, huh? Just goes to show that a few billion dollars still does get you a lot in the modern world, I suppose. Anyway, on with the orientation. Has anyone mentioned to you that there are three other companies of roughly the same size and resources, all making a play for the same city at the same time? Unlikely, isn&rsquo;t it? You&rsquo;d think we&rsquo;d plan these sorts of things a little better. Maybe that can be one of the &lsquo;big changes&rsquo; you make around here once we&rsquo;ve put you through orientation, huh?<br/><br/>--Goal of the game--<br/><br/>Our company can chase the others out of the city in one of two ways.<br/><br/>(1)    Control 20% of the city&rsquo;s total income before anyone else<br/><br/>or<br/>    (2)    Control the greatest percentage of the city&rsquo;s income when the place gets as big as it can be (10x5 tiles)<br/><br/>So, I know we&rsquo;re essentially at war with those other corporations and there probably shouldn&rsquo;t be rules about this sort of thing, but there are. If you don&rsquo;t follow them, the other corporations will all call us names and tell on us to judges. Seriously, boss, stick to the rules, it&rsquo;s just easier on everyone.<br/><br/>",

Thanks to the financial resources you have, you can afford the services of foreign powers to fight the battle.<br/><br/>Your territory, such as your enemies is divided into 10 provinces, materialized by tokens. In different ways, you can destroy your enemies provinces, they can destroy yours, you can rebuild, and they also. When a player's 10 provinces are destroyed, it is eliminated. The last player to have at least one province has won the war.<br/><br/>Apart from the money, there are four types of cards: the production units, combat units, units of action and events. These units belong to foreign powers grouped into five categories: United States, Europe, Eastern Countries, Asia and Arab countries. Depending on the money you have, you can afford the services of these units.<br/><br/>Combat units, such as production units, are placed on the territory of the player. For that, each time he places a card, he must pay the recruitment fee or purchase price, either by using profits from its production, either with cash it may have on hand.<br/><br/>Each unit can only move once per turn. They can either join a production unit to support his defense, or to regroup them (maximum 3 units can be grouped ) or go to war: for this, the player must pay the travel expenses, and the unit then join the combat zone, a &quot;no man's land&quot; in the center of the table. When your opponent has no more unity in the combat zone or to protect his territory , each time you attack him, your attack will destroy a province...<br/><br/>",

Horses carried people on their backs, pulled coaches, carriages and wagons. Horses were everywhere and did everything. Mail coaches carried letters and parcels; stagecoaches, post chaises, wagons and carts carried passengers between towns and cities. Horses were changed at Inns and passengers were collected, rested and fed. If you walk around the old parts of our towns and cities you will see the old Inns with their arched entrances and courtyards. Their names often remind us of their coaching past.&quot;<br/><br/>A simple roll-and-move game where your &quot;coach&quot; has to go round the board and collect a passenger from each four Inns.

Make sure you get the right judges on your side or you don&rsquo;t stand a chance!<br/><br/>Materials: Basic Decktet and 10 markers in each of the six suits. You may use the Excuse to hold the influence tokens collected by the judges.<br/><br/>Pauntel's Got Talent is an indirect trick-taking game largely inspired by Triumvirate (this may be a bit of an understatement). During the each hand player's will play to tricks which will determine which of the judges, represented by the 6 suits, gains influence for that round. At the end of each hand player's can pledge one card face down. The player who pledges more cards to any given suit wins the favor of that judge and any influence, or points, they are worth.<br/><br/>",

The players journey together along the road, but vie for valor and the recognition of their peers.<br/><br/>Journey's End uses a system of skills collected from different decks, each represented by the back of a card.  Meanwhile, the card fronts represent locations along the road traveled, detailing the Quests, Places, and Events the adventurers encounter.  Only a portion of these cards are used each game, providing Journey's End with a multitude of game scenarios.<br/><br/>The game hinges on how players allocate their skills during each round of play.  Chief among them are several types of bidding wars, where the adventurer who shows the most skill can complete a Quest or take advantage of an Event.  Players who feel like they're falling behind can gain new skills or compete over the game's namesake, the Journey's End card.  Ultimately, the adventurer with the most Valor at the end of the game can claim victory.<br/><br/>Journey's End provides the genesis of play popular in a deck-builder, but dispenses with the solitary nature of these games.  With healthy doses of resource management, bidding, and planning, players can enjoy a quick game with all the complexities of larger and longer games.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Advanced Squad Leader Starter Kits (ASLSK) depict World War II combat at the tactical (company-sized) level, using squad-sized units in an interactive phased turn sequence based on the original 1977 Squad Leader game. The game was intended as a gateway to the Advanced Squad Leader system created from the original Squad Leader in 1985.<br/><br/>Discussions at the Armchair General/Strategy Zone Online (SZO) forums in 2005 led some to surmise that the ASLSKs in many ways brought back the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the original Squad Leader, having just a handful of unit types, mapboards, and rules necessary in order to play. A controversial design aspect of that original Squad Leader game was the use of four mapboards, laid end-to-end, in the design of two of the twelve enclosed scenarios. From these discussions, a contest was announced on November 29, 2005, to see if it was possible to recreate the &quot;feel&quot; of those original scenarios using Starter Kit components.<br/><br/>Pete Shelling took the prize from among a talented field of contestants, including veteran gamer Murray McCloskey, Tom Morin, editor for Dispatches from the Bunker who has since seen his popular Valor of the Guards module released by MMP, Ola Nygards, whose Eastern Front scenarios have seen print in ASL Journal, Jean-Pascal Paoli, a regular contributor to French ASL magazine Le Franc Tireur, and veteran scenario designer Pete Shelling, who has had scenarios published in The General and ASL Journal in addition to various third party venues.<br/><br/>Scenarios include:<br/><br/>Scenario A: To the Soldiers of the Ostfront<br/>Scenario B: Exhausting But Productive<br/>Scenario C: Thank Heavens, We Lost<br/>Scenario D: Crimson Snow<br/>Scenario E: Glimmer of Hope<br/>Scenario F: Air Assault on Drvar<br/>Scenario G: Siege Without Shells<br/>Scenario H: Aidez L'Espagne!<br/><br/>",

The aim is to go home, and the game ends when one or more players have completed the journey and acquired the necessary number of tokens.The game is different each time it is played - depending on the players and the life events that crop up.<br/><br/>There are two journeys:<br/><br/><br/>     Through age: by moving through the quadrants of the board representing childhood, youth, prime and vintage, each with a gateway into the next.<br/>     Towards home: by accumulating tokens of particular colours, representing the different strands of home: shelter, family, community, environment and inner peace.<br/><br/><br/>When one player goes home, s/he is able to help others do so with any extra tokens. At the end of the game, each player may tell the story of his/her character.<br/><br/>The game is based on the book of the same name (formerly The O of Home) by Jennifer Kavanagh.

If you do, you move that many spaces equivalent to the card that you played (Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King =13). The square you now land on will dictate the suit you should play next turn so that you can advance again.

        "description": "Naval Bombardment should be described as a sophisticated version of the old favourite, Battleships.<br/><br/>The objective of each player is to destroy the opponent's fleet.<br/><br/>Each player provides himself with two grids of 20 x 20 squares, lettered A to T down the side and numbered 1 to 20 across the top. One of these is used for disposing the player's own navy (the 'home' chart), the other for recording salvos on his opponent's chart (the 'away' chart). In addition to these, at the foot of each chart there should be a diagram similar to that shown in Fig. 1 for the purpose of recording hits. This fulfills the dual aim of showing at a glance the combinations of salvo numbers required for locating ships and the amount of fire-power left to each player at any time. Both players should locate themselves in such a way that their charts cannot be seen by the opponent.<br/><br/>Each fleet is composed of thirteen ships. The following table shows the names, sizes and fire-power of each vessel<br/>1 Flagship (FS) . . .8 squares. . .3 guns (3-3-2)<br/>1 Battleship (BS) . . .7 squares . . .3 guns (3-2-2)<br/>2 Heavy Cruisers (HC) . . .6 squares . . .2 guns each (3-3)<br/>2 Light Cruisers (LC) . . .5 squares . . .2 guns each (3-2)<br/>3 Destroyers (Dy) .. .4 squares . . .2 guns each (2-2)<br/>4 Corvettes (Cv) . . .3 squares . . .1 gun each<br/>The figures in parentheses above indicate the way in which guns are destroyed by successful bombardment. For instance, the flagship's first gun is knocked out of action after any three of its squares have been hit, the second gun after any six squares have been hit, and the third when it has been totally sunk. It will be seen that initially each player has a salvo of 24 shots.<br/><br/>In addition to his fleet, each player is provided with twelve mines. Four of these are high-explosive type, the rest ordinary, and their functions are explained later.<br/><br/>Ships may run vertically, horizontally or diagonally, but must of course be in a straight line. No ship or mine can be contiguous either laterally or diagonally with any other ship or mine &mdash; there must always be at least one separating square in each case.<br/><br/>When both players have placed all their ships and mines, a coin is tossed to decide who starts. The winner of the toss then proceeds to enumerate the 24 shots of his first salvo. As he calls out the squares both he and his opponent mark the appropriate charts &mdash; i.e. his 'away' and the opponent's 'home' respectively - putting a figure &lsquo;1&rsquo; in each square as it is called. It is advisable, in order to avoid mistakes, for the opponent to repeat the squares after each one is called or at the end of the salvo.<br/><br/>The salvo having been completed and marked, the opponent then indicates what damage, if any, has been sustained. The information that he gives is restricted to the type of ships hit and the number of squares in each case &mdash; not the location. For instance, he might say: Two hits on the flagship, one on a destroyer and one on a corvette'. The only time that any further identification is given is when two or more ships of the same type have already sustained damage, as described later. It then becomes the turn of the second player to fire off his salvo, and the same procedure is observed, both players marking the squares called with the figure '1' again, but this time in the other charts. Naturally, before the second player starts his turn both will have checked to see whether he is still entitled to the full original twenty-four shots or whether any of his fire-power has been reduced. Play continues in this way, the next set of salvos from each player being record&not;ed with the figure '2', and so on.<br/><br/>When a hit or hits are registered on one of two or more ships of the same type which have already suffered damage, the ship must be differentiated by salvo numbers. For example, player A has hit both of player B's Light Cruisers, one with salvo 2 and the other with salvos 3 and 4; if on salvo 5 he again hits one of these two ships, player B must say whether it is the '2' ship of the '3-4' ship. One way of arranging this differentiation neatly is to assign names or letters to those ships which have more than one in their class, e.g. Destroyers A, B and C, Heavy Cruisers A and B, etc.<br/><br/>The only square to be identified immediately is one containing a mine. When a player's shot lands on one of these his salvo comes to an abrupt end and he loses the rest of his shots in that salvo. In the case of a high-explosive mine he not only loses the remainder of the current salvo but the whole of the next one as well.<br/><br/>Fig. 1 shows a typical layout at the start of a game, while Fig. 2 shows the same chart but with all the &quot;used&quot; squares filled in &mdash; i.e. the squares actually occupied by vessels and mines plus all the surrounding squares which are unusable through the application of the ship placement rules. This is done to illustrate the importance of correct location of opponents' destroyed ships; note that although the occupied squares number only 73, there is a total of 323 'used' squares plus a further 8 in which no ship could possibly be, (designated in the diagram with an 'x').<br/><br/>It is noticeable when playing with beginners that they tend to pepper an identified target area instead of limiting the follow-up shots to a few well-placed attempts. This blitzkrieg approach may well knock out a gun somewhat more quickly than the more patient player, but it has two distinct drawbacks: (a) it will waste most of the salvo doing so instead of exploring other areas and (b) more seriously, the player will probably end up not knowing where the destroyed ship is and consequently not knowing which of his opponent's squares are unusable, which, especially towards the end of the game, can be a strong disadvantage when salvos are small and every wasted shot a severe liability.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tactical level wargame based on the Japanese animated series &quot;Armored Trooper Votoms&quot;. The game was developed over five different games published in Dual Magazine issues no. 6 to no. 10. Each game featured a different setting but used same basic rules with different map and units. Game no. 5, &quot;Armored Trooper,&quot; serves as an omnibus edition and collects most of the rules from the previous four games.<br/><br/>Players each control one or more piloted Armored Trooper mecha units (AT for short).<br/><br/>Each turn, players choose a behavior, called an &quot;Action Pattern&quot; for each unit. An action pattern (such as Run, Walk, Fire (Weapon), Dive (Underwater), and Roller Dash (use roller skate-like wheels)) determines how a unit may move and how well it performs in combat for that turn. Players also plot their movement and how many shots they will fire from a ranged weapon, if any.<br/><br/>All movement takes place simultaneously and the players move their units on a hex map.<br/><br/>After movement, ranged and close combat (called &quot;Battling&quot;) are resolved. All action is simultaneous, so results of damage do not take effect until the end of the turn.<br/><br/>In the basic game, each player use one Armored Trooper and battle to destroy the opponent. A skilled player can handle more Armored Troopers for large-scale battles. A few scenarios are included, but players are expected to design their own combat situations.<br/><br/>Game no. 3 &quot;Outer Space Battle&quot; is very different from the other games. It uses vector-based movement in outer space and only a small number of AT units are able to be used outside of the atmosphere.<br/><br/>",

The map comprise 4 sets of 6 cards each, forming an end to end in proper order and from a route of plane travel from San Francisco in the west to Shanghai China in the east. The route cards show 12 important stops along the way with a picture of a point of interest, the flag of the country, a symbol or emblem or a person or two in native dress. There are two alike cards for each of these 12 stops These cards are numbered San Francisco 5, New York 10, Gander 15, Shannon 20 and so on, Each succeeding card stop traveling East increases in value by 5 until Shanghai (value 60) is reached.<br/><br/>How to play: Deal 9 cards to each player and place th reminder of the deck face down on the table Players draw a card from the deck either from the face down pile of the face up discard pile and then discard a card. The object is to lay down the 6 map cards showing a complete route from San Francisco to Shanghai. The first 3 cars of the lay down must be done together. The other 3 can be laid down one at a time if so desired, After getting the 6 map cards down the next objective is to get consecutive route card in hand an play the down 3 cards together saying I am getting off in Rome which means that you laid down Paris, Geneva and Rome cards and then discarded the other card in your hand scoring the total value of the cars, in this case 90 (25 for Paris,30 for Geneva and 35 for Rome, so the further east you travel the more points you will score. Completing a flight before an opponent has laid down his map cards gets you a 100 point bonus. When playing partnerships,  you can play on your partners cards until one map of 6 consecutive cards is completed and then either partner can ask &ldquo;Would you like to get off in Bombay or some other stop depending on cards held to which your partner must answer yes or no, in which case the one asking is bound by the response of his partner. However one partner may simply say we are getting of in Paris and then lay down the required cards. Scorekeeper then records the score at the end of each turn. First team to 500 or 100 wins the game<br/><br/>",

The cards are the 5 hunting locations while the 6th card is another caveman hunter, allowing you to double up at that location. The cards are revealed and you transfer your cavemen figures to the marker. Each turn there is a winner at the hunting ground based on the highest number of cavemen there.

        "description": "Glory of the Three Kingdoms is a living deck-building game (LDBG) in which each player takes a role leading an allegiance in the Three Kingdoms period and battles for total victory or for victory points.<br/><br/>As in most deck-building games, player acquire additional cards to add to their decks. In GOTK, player may acquire cards depicting heroes, military, strategy, items, etc., and some cards provide victory points for endgame scoring. Unlike other games of this type, GOTK has a battle phase during which each player secretly deploys military cards (foot soldiers, pikemen, calvary and archers) and battles for Glory. The victor takes a glory token from the defeated player and a free card in the neutral zone. The victor may also capture and recruit the defeated general &ndash; or have him beheaded.<br/><br/>When two out of four card decks are depleted, the game ends and the player with the most victory points wins. However, if one allegiance acquired six or more Tiger Tally or all of opponent's glory tokens, the game ends immediately and the allegiance wins.<br/><br/>The first battle theme of GOTK is Guandu, the first major battle in the Three Kingdoms period. The Guandu Core Set, a two-player game, comes with Cao Cao and Yuan Shao allegiances. Lu Bu and Liu Bei allegiances will be available in a future three- and four-player expansion.<br/><br/>",

A game of skills for 2-4 players where the horse tokens have to be flipped through the show jumping course.&quot;<br/><br/>A steeple-chase course is created using the 2 pieces of string supplied. 5 high obstacles, on bases, are placed at regular intervals around the course. 10 ground obstacles are arranged between these. 16 horse show tokens are placed in the middle of the course and the horse figure to the side. This is the starting point.<br/><br/>Each player takes 1 small and one large coloured horse token (with horse sticker on) and placing the large token on the supplied piece of felt, uses the small token to try and flick his horse around the course, following the flicking rules laid out.

        "description": "The British offensive to relieve Tobruk / November 18 - December 8, 1941<br/><br/>Armored Knights North Afrika - Operation Crusader pits the numerically inferior but tactically superior Axis forces of Rommel against the British forces trying to open a route to Tobruk and free the trapped garrison there.  The game provides a framework for Operational level combat that highlights the interaction between the various combined arms elements present.  The game system uses a variable strength table that players use to determine how much benefit they get from the various different combat multiplying forces.  Engineers, Anti-Tank, Anti-Aircraft, Recon, Close Air Support, and Artillery all work together to enhance you chances of success.  And sometimes they don't do it right and don't work as well together as we would like.  This creates a great deal of excitement in the battle and makes you think twice.<br/><br/>The battle for Tobruk started on 18 November 1941 with the British moving 3 Armoured Brigades and a host of Infantry Divisions toward the port and perimeter.  Some were fast cruiser tanks and others were faster American built Stuart tanks.  The British would get a jump on the Germans and Rommel would be slow to realize there was a major offensive underway.  There would be a number of major engagements to include two battles for the Sidi Rezegh Airfield, one for Bir El Gubi, where the Italians turned in a good account of themselves, and Rommel's famous Dash to the Wire.  His dash was a failure, but he recovered in time to fight  successful second battle for Sidi Rezegh.<br/><br/>All units modeled as battalions, companies/batteries.<br/>Hexes represent approximately 2km of terrain.<br/>Each turn represents 2 hours of ff daylight or 2-4 hours of night.<br/><br/>This game comes with:<br/>&bull; Armored Knights North Afrika Rules <br/>&bull;(5) 11x17 Scenario Cards <br/>&bull; Numerous Player Aides and Examples <br/>&bull; Game Turn Record Track <br/>&bull; (16) 11 x 17 Full Color map sections <br/>&bull; (4) Full Color Order of Battle Charts <br/>&bull; Very Sturdy box<br/>&bull; Approximately 1200 double sided unit counters and markers<br/><br/>(from box and publisher's website)<br/><br/>",

Only the top card of each row is available for play action.  Players are then dealt a hand of action cards that allow them to move cards in the tableau, search the dig field, dig in one column of the field, or load cards onto the camel train (in a separate area).  &quot;No Trespassing&quot; cards will block digging in a particular column and force a player to play a (limited quantity) &quot;Deal&quot; card in order to access any valuable treasure locked above that card.<br/><br/>When the camel train contains 15 treasures, the game ends and the team of archaeologists determines the value of the treasures collected.  As this is a cooperative game, the goal is to obtain the greatest possible treasure score as a team (a perfect game being a score of 115).<br/><br/>",

Those are just the easy ones...but guessing the sound is only half the fun. Once the sound is identified, the source of that sound must be quickly found amid one of the eight illustrated scenes that are filled with action and surprises!<br/><br/>SOUND IT! FOUND IT! is a fun &amp; completely new patent-pending &quot;2-in-1&quot; board game in which two compelling play patterns are brought together for one amazing game! Building off the popularity of the guessing game format, Sound It! Found It! challenges players to guess the picture on the game card by listening to the (sometimes crazy) sounds that other players make. Once players guess what's on the cards, they then must race to find that object on one of eight scene boards.<br/><br/>With 96 cards and eight giant scene boards, each drawn in a hilariously original style, Sound It! Found It! combines visual hilarity with the unique twist of guessing sounds, offering hours of laugh-out-loud fun for the whole family.<br/><br/>",

Each player then selects if they want to fight the monster they have, or rest. If the group has higher attack than the monster's defence, it's defeated, and the player go deeper into the forest.

If the question is answered correctly, the card is kept and the person with the most number of cards after 5 or 10 minutes is the winner. This simple concept can be played by all ages and in large groups as well as a 1 person game.<br/><br/>Made from a minimum of 70% recycled material and designed in the UK, the BrainBox range is fabulous fun.

        "description": "Tutatis is a fantasy gaelic football game produced by Greebo Miniatures, an italian editor already known for its high quality fantasy miniatures. The game is set in the fantasy world of Triskearth, a brand new world utterly created by the designers of the game. Its history and geography, as well as the background for every race, are described in the first 150 pages of the rulebook. The remaining twenty pages describe the gaming rules, bringing to life a fast &amp; furios game of tactic and bashing!<br/><br/>The game is played on a 11 x 16 squares field, each team can field on the pitch seven payers. Every team (are planned to be released nearly thirty teams) has its own rooster of players, each one with its stats (movement, strength, agility, constitution, ball play), skills and costs, including three different captains. The game time is divided in two halves each one made up of six turns for each player. Turns are played alternatively by each player, completing the action of a single player before passing to the next one. The aim of the game is to score more points (goals or kicks over the crossbar) than the opponent, and you can achieve this with a passing/dodging style or with a more brutal one. Someone could recognize a gameplay similar to other games concerning sports, but this is not a great flaw since Tutatis has it's peculiar flavor thanks to the rules of gaelic football (ie. not forward passage, soloing rule exc.) and to the characterization of each team.<br/><br/>Greebo miniatures has produced a prerelease box of the game (with rules still in beta) at the 2011 Lucca Comics &amp; Games convention, and it was a sold out. That box contained a cardboard field, Italian rulebook, two Greebo's d6, a ball and two teams in 15mm (orcs and dwarves). Since then on Greebo's website have been published in English and in Italian the definitive set of rules and the roosters for the new teams, all available as free downloads. At the moment have been released three kinds of fields (irond peak, thornwell and standard), the miniatures of some mercenaries and nine teams: orcs, dwarves, evil puppets, necros, poffy and five different teams of thornwell (frogs, lizards, turtles, snakes and a mixed team). Greebo's team is working on the championship rules expected to be released as open beta in mid autumn 2012, as well as on a new edition of the game box.

In between he has an exciting and illustrious career in the Peninsula with the 95th Rifles and the Light Company of the West Sussex Regiment. Here we present eighteen scenarios, each with an introductory story, briefings for both sides and umpire's notes with a full colour map. The games are designed for between 30 and 100 or so figures per side, and are rip-roaring exciting games, packed with derring-do, larger than life characters and, best of all, real gaming challenges and fun. The scenarios included are as follows.<br/><br/>Fondler's Battle, Fondler's Enemy, Fondler's Rifles, Fondler's Allies, Fondler's Captain, Fondler's Pirate, Fondler's Colonel, Fondler's Gold, Fondler's Trap, Fondler's Escape, Fondler's Surprise, Fondler's Honour, Fondler's Siege, Fondler's Lady, Fondler's Triumph, Fondler's Breech, Fondler's Duke, and Fondler's Waterloo. All draw on the rich heritage of literary heroes and villains.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Collection of 6 boardgames based on the use of magnetic marbles (clickets) as game pieces.<br/><br/>The box contains six games. Each of the games is a combination of the nature of the magnetic marbles (e.g. magnetism) and strategic or random placement of the marbles on the board.<br/><br/>The object is to place or remove those magnetic marbles without moving or disturbing the marbles still occupying holes on the gamebord.<br/><br/>CLACTO HARLEQUIN is a game of dice, not unlike the traditional game, but combined with the magnetic force of the 'clickets' the game gets a somewhat wider perspective. Apart from the placement of the clickets of the board as the throw of the dice indicates, the players have tot take the magnetism in account.<br/><br/>The same principle goes for CLACTO DICE.<br/><br/>CLACTO FISH is about removing clickets from the gameboard without disturbing the other clickets.<br/><br/>CLACTO 4 AND 4, CLACTO TACTIC and CLACTO SNAKES all have the placement of clickets on the board as subject, without moving or disturbing the clickets allready placed.<br/><br/>",

Using 25 cards (A,10,K,Q,J,9,8,7 from non-Diamonds and 7 of Diamond), the game is played like an easy version of Skat.<br/><br/>For 4-player game, players are dealt 5 cards. Among the remaining 5 cards, 3 of them are not used and 2 of them are placed face down in the middle of the table. Each player bids the number of tricks they can take with their choice of the trump suit. The game value is equal to these number of tricks called. Each of the following causes to double the game value: by not using the face-down cards (Hand game), by choosing a diamond as a trump (called &quot;Ruten&quot; - notice that there is only one diamond card in the deck), or by bidding 5 (called Durch).<br/><br/>There are also some special bids. Kieker is like null and he can use all 5 face-down cards to exchange his hand. Siebener Fips is the case to have all four 7s and an Ace.<br/><br/>",

Two or three players or teams direct the actions of the opposing air forces as they seek to inflict more damage than they suffer in this attritional contest.&quot;<br/><br/>UB Bombers from England and Italy move steadly towards their German targets while the US fighters seek to keep then protected from German fighter attack.  Simple machanics mean the game is easy to learn, but the differing ranges of the fighters and speed of the bombers mean planning ahead is required.  Not knowing when the Germans may attack and cause the fighters to drop their fuel tanks, and so have to return home make this harder than it sounds.<br/><br/>",

If he does not have such a card, he must choose one anyway and announce it as if it was the correct card. If not challenged, he can discard the card on to the discard pile. If challenged and it is correct or incorrect, the offending player (either the player or the challenger) must draw extra cards as a penalty. Then it is the next player's turn and he must announce &quot;Crapauds&quot; and choose a card, and follow the same rules. The next player announces &quot;Asticots&quot;, and so on.<br/><br/>Poivre cards and Balai cards add to the fun. A Poivre (Pepper) card played means that your turn passes to the next player.

Deep inside of the cold, snowy Northern Mountains, Isengrimm resides in his Golden Halls to rule over the Dwarfs, who delve deep into the rock to fill their lord's treasuries with gold, silver and precious gems. In Darkwood Forest, Xilvox reigns supreme over his countless Alben minions. Known as the King of the Clouds, Goldfeather is the lord of all Griffins and ruler of the Skies. On the southern islands Lord Zephiros, the Master-Mage, has his domain and guards many arcane secrets which are the key to his enormous magical powers.<br/><br/>The fourth expansion to Elemental Clash &ndash; Unicum &ndash; brings you 72 exciting, all-new cards. Command mighty &quot;Unique&quot; Creatures or cast powerful &quot;Unique&quot; Spells (cards which are so powerful your Spellbook can only have one copy of them). Also, a new ability &ndash; Immunity &ndash; is introduced and four new, exciting races make their debut: Albs, Griffins, Fish and Dwarfs.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to reduce the cards in your opponent&rsquo;s card-deck (or Spellbook) to zero by using the Spells and Creatures in your Spellbook. Players take turns that always follow the same structure. For each point of damage a Player receives through Creatures or Spells, he or she puts the top card of his or her deck on his or her Discard Pile (or Archive). If a player unable to draw a card, he or she loses immediately.<br/><br/>",

Their task is simple: to hang clothes on the balconies.  But, the air and shaky hands might cause some of the clothespins, pinza de ropa in Spanish, to fall, or mysteriously end up on a higher floor of the building!<br/><br/>The players alternate turns during which they try to have as many clothespins as possible on their floor.  Each player's floor is designated by a secret objective card (marked with a star).<br/><br/>During their turn players choose a floor on the board, roll the dice, and then may play cards to affect the outcome of the dice.  Each number on the dice different from the player's floor means that a clothespin must go to another floor.  A special objective card indicates which floor is best for that player's clothespins.  The winner of the game is the one that gathers the most points, based on the special objective card and a player's played cards during the duration of the game.<br/><br/>The print &amp; play version which will be available through this site and the publisher's page is the family version of the game.  A future version of Pinza de Ropa will include a new advanced version, with more cards, strategies, and surprises that will make the game even better!<br/><br/>The only thing not provided in the print'n play version of the game are the 5 dice.  You will need 5 6-sided dice to play.  Also, if you wish, you may use real clothespins.  We have provided a .pdf with a printable clothespin, but if you want to pimp out the game...<br/><br/>",

When the answer is not designated &quot;All Play,&quot; one team simply tries to come up with the answer before the timer runs out, which is usually but not always possible thanks to the varying difficulty levels of the answers.

        "description": "Dead End is survival-horror strategy game which pits survivors against zombies in a city-scape scenario. The world has succumbed to a laboratory-engineered super virus, bringing humanity to the brink of extinction and reanimated those who were once dead. The few who remain alive spend their days seeking out fellow survivors to help improve their chances for survival. It is a constant struggle to find sufficient food, tools, and--relatively safe--shelter.<br/><br/>Your story begins with your vehicle having just broken down in the middle of Sanctuary City. You must now wander the streets looking for replacement parts to repair your vehicle. During your trek, you will encounter roadblocks, lootable buildings, and countless zombie hordes. As you progress, your team will be faced with game-changing choices: does your team stop to rest and recuperate, risking the chance of a zombie attack, or move on? Do you split off from your group to check out that side-street, or stick together to better your survival odds? Meanwhile, the zombie player's hordes lurk around every corner, to ensure no one gets out alive.<br/><br/>Using a simplified dice-rolling system, Dead End allows for in-depth strategy and variety without bogging down the game in rules and exceptions. This allows the game to be fun and exciting for players of all ages.<br/><br/>",

To accomplish this, you will SKIRMISH against your opponent constantly on the field of battle using the cards that you&rsquo;ve drawn into your hand.<br/><br/>When you first look at SKIRMISH the condition for victory is easy: just make sure that your SKIRMISHER on the field of battle has a higher rating than your opponent&rsquo;s SKIRMISHER. But things would be just too easy if that was all there is to it&hellip;<br/><br/>You've got to watch out for bombs, spies and snipers, all the while using your cards strategically for field reviews, reinforcements and the ever-popular bomb and spy busting.<br/><br/>The strategy is as deep as you make it. Should you open with a Bomb to get a head start at breaking your opponent&rsquo;s defenses? Do you bait their largest rated cards out into the field with one of your lower rated cards? Do you take the gamble of sending a Sniper out looking for their top rated cards? Do you expect a bomb to be coming and send out a Bomb Buster?<br/><br/>Whatever you do there is no guarantee of victory as you have to learn to read your opponent and out bluff him. The tides can quickly turn from that of sure victory to nail biting defeat and visa versa.<br/><br/>",

You will be scrambling to press buttons to complete combinations, only you will be using cards instead of a video game controller. Your goal is to deliver papers, avoid danger, and vandalize houses better, and faster than your opponent.<br/><br/>Paper Route is a turn-less &quot;real-time&quot; game. At the start of a round five houses are paired with five obstacles. Together, they form a sequence of buttons that players must play in order to score their points. Once both players agree, the round begins and the players flip cards, one at a time, from the top of their deck and play them on a house. The faster you can play, the better... but be careful! If you mess up, you lose a life and if you lose all your lives, your opponent wins!<br/><br/>Paper Route uses the Cardboard Arcade game system.  Cardboard Arcade consists of a deck of cards that represents a classic arcade controller.

But the stars are essential for all the inhabitants of the planets. Without their light, plants, animals and people cannot live. Help the Little Prince convince Antoine to set the stars free. Accompany the Prince and his friend, the fox, when they return the stars to their place in the universe.<br/><br/>Setup: The board is placed at the middle of the table. Airplane and die are set aside. The 6 snake tiles are placed on the planet at the center of the board. The outline star tiles are shuffled and placed face up all over the room. The star tiles with the filled-in stars are shuffled and distributed evenly among the players, face down. Each player selects a player character on the board and places the stack of face-down star tiles in front of themselves.<br/><br/>Gameplay: The start player takes the airplane. He/she then looks at the top tile of their star tiles stack. They try to remember its colour and shape. The active player then says &quot;start&quot; and moves around the room, looking for the matching outline star tile. When they find it, they put it into a slit on the plane and fly back to the Planet of Astronomy. They then put the matching pair of tiles in front of them, turn over the second tile from their stack and try again to find the matching tile.<br/>As soon as the active player has embarked on his/her flight, the player to his/her left rolls the die until the snake symbol appears. He/she then takes a snake tile from the board and passes on the die to the next player. The other players continue rolling the die until the last snake tile has been taken from the board. This means that the active player's flight phase is over and it's the next player's turn.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has collected his/her last pair of tiles. The current round is continued until each player has had an equal number of turns. All players that only have complete pairs of tiles after this round win the game.<br/><br/>",

It is played on the spaces of a 10x10 board. The board is divided by two red intersecting lines creating four 5 x 5 quadrants. You will also need a set of reversi pieces. The game starts out with 2 black and 2 white reversi pieces placed on the four marked squares on the board.<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>Players decide who goes first then play alternates.<br/><br/>On each turn players must take two actions:<br/><br/>1)Move one of your color reversi pieces &ldquo;ballista&rdquo; exactly like a queen in Chess, orthogonally or diagonally onto any empty space as long as the piece stays within the quadrant where the move initiated from.<br/><br/>2)Fire a &ldquo;projectile&rdquo; reversi piece in your color away in a straight line orthogonally or diagonally from the piece just moved, then placing the new reversi piece in your color onto any empty space within one of the other three remaining quadrants.<br/><br/>Players also have the option on their turn to capture an enemy stone. Captures in Ballista are custodian, i.e., an enemy stone is captured when sandwiched between two friendly stones (orthogonal or diagonal). Captured enemy pieces are not removed from the board but flipped over to your color.<br/><br/>Note: A ballista or fired projectile reversi piece may not jump over a friend or enemy piece, also any friendly pieces that were projectiles may now become a ballista.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player has no valid move.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is decided by the players - either being first to reach school or winning the most chips.<br/>Players take turns rolling the number die and move their piece according to the die roll. If you land on a space with a circle next to it, you earn a chip. Reaching a stop sign means you have to stop. On your next turn, you roll the colour die and can move on if you roll green. Landing on a space with an exclamation mark means you've put yourself in danger (board shows a dangerous situation) and you lose a chip.<br/>There is also a variant that uses cards: Before crossing a road, you have to answer a road safety question printed on one of the cards.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns playing capital cards on bills until the draw pile is exhausted.  Bills pass with a simple majority, meaning more than half of the votes on a bill are in support.  Bills may either occupy the center of the table or be placed in front of a player who has chosen to champion them.  Championed bills earns their champion more points when passed, but costs that player a point when blocked.  Players also earn points by passing bills that are favored by their party, and by ending the game with lots of cards left in their hand.  The player with the most points at the end of a game is the winner.<br/><br/>",

A board game based on the acclaimed Super Famicom title , The Legend of Zelda: Triforce of the Gods,(or A link to the Past in english), plunges you into the world of obscure board gaming. An ancient relic unknown to many non-japanese speaking Zelda fans everywhere.<br/><br/>Not much is known about this little piece of history with no rule book opened for public eye. According to a fellow bgg translator, the back of the box vaguely claims to &quot;teach you the secrets of the Super Famicom game&quot;. If you play this game, you can learn how to play A Link To the Past. In Japaneses! The player(s) start at town and thru playing the game, one can find out about various items and how things work. And best of all, up to three players can play! Wow!<br/><br/>Components used are a big mat to place cards. Cards with various enemies, tokens and tiles, a stickered die, and three poker chips as player pawns!What's different of this Zelda board game from the other two known Zelda board games so far is that it features authentic sprite art from the super famicom/Super Nes title!<br/><br/>&quot;&hellip; very strange.&quot;<br/>~Z****n<br/><br/>",

There are 12 sets of three, each card in a set having the same letter in the bottom corner. The three cards are related i.e. A sheep, a ball of wool and a jumper makes up the set F. In addition there is a Clever Child Card and a Schwarzer Peter card.<br/><br/>Various uses of the cards are described. You could play as a quartett game (as a game of Authors in America), the one collecting the most sets of three will be the winner. Or you could play as a Schwarzer Peter (Old Maid) game, the one finishing with the Schwarzer Peter card being the loser. If the parents thought that losing was harsh, then you could play a 'White Peter', the child having the Clever Child gard at the end being the winner. And you could play it as a quiz game where the parent will reveal one card of a set and ask the children in turn to name another card they might expect to see. If they can, they get the card and so on, the one with the most cards at the end being the winner.<br/><br/>",

I chose this name because the relationship between the stone you place and the stones you flip is similar to the relationship between an Amazon and an Arrow in the classic abstract game Amazons.<br/><br/>Arrello is a 2-player game played with two-sided stones (green on one side, red on the other), on a 7x7 square grid.<br/><br/>Players take turns, one player playing the stones red side up, the other green side up onto an empty space.  If it is placed adjacent to a same-color stone, one can choose to flip a opponent's stone(s).<br/><br/>The game ends when the board is full.  The player with the majority of stones in their color wins, because of the odd number of space ties are not possible.<br/><br/>",

In the centre of the table place some spoons (one less than there are players). The dealer takes a card from the drawing pile. He discards one card from his hand by placing it face down on the table to his left. The next player picks up the discard for his hand and places a discard on the table to his left, etc. The dealer always draws from the drawing pile when it's his turn. The last discard from each round is added to the discard pile, which is reshuffled and used when the drawing pile is gone. When any player completes a set (4 of a kind), he grabs a spoon. All other players then grab for a spoon too. The player who fails to get a spoon is out of the game. One spoon is removed from the table and play resumes. When there are only 2 players left, the one who grabs the last spoon is the winner.<br/><br/>This is not the same game as Spoons although there are similarities. This is much faster to play to a finish.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This unique logic based board game is sure to bring out your intellectually competitive side, as you attempt to thwart the moves of your opponent in conquering the board. The board game seamlessly blends two popular games that have grown to be all the rage among avid puzzlers. Sudoku, the game of logic and arrangement challenges players to correctly place 9 digits in a given grid, while a victory in the game of Checkers implies travelling across the board capturing your opponent&rsquo;s tokens.<br/><br/>The game board is divided into nine quadrants of 3x3 squares each. Each player starts off with 9 tokens, each of a different color, in one corner quadrant. The goal is to move to the opposite diagonal corner quadrant of the board using the same movement style as in Checkers i.e., jumping over an adjacent piece but with the condition that no two tokens in any quadrant can be of the same color at any time during the game.<br/><br/>Although ideal for ages 8 years and above, this game can be attempted by virtually anyone with a penchant for logical challenges.<br/><br/>",

The Williamites (10 brigades in orange) are a mix of Ulster Presbyterians and English, Dutch, Danish and Huguenot troops. The two players control brigades and move them from point to point across Ireland.

If it shows a bag symbol with one or two dots, the active player takes the corresponding number of birds out of the bag (without looking) and places them on the board of that colour. Then the die is passed on to the next player. If the hand symbol is rolled, one, two or three (again determined by the number of dots next to the symbol) birds are taken from the bag and shown to the other players. The active player then puts his/her hands under the table and secretly distributes the birds between his/her two hands and closes them.

He is certainly a fun and versatile Master to play, and if you decide to start a Marcus Crew, his wide choice of minions inevitably ends up encouraging you to expand to additional Masters, since you'll have the models to form the foundation of those crews.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Following Japan&rsquo;s attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, Germany swiftly joined its Axis partner and declared war on the United States on Dec. 11, 1941. Admiral Karl D&ouml;nitz, commander of Germany&rsquo;s much-feared u-boat fleet, altered his strategy to bring the maritime war to America&rsquo;s east coast. Where once he relied on German submarines preying on supply convoys on the open Atlantic Ocean, now he deployed long-range Type-IX u-boats to prowl the American coastal waters along which freighters and tankers sailed to convoy assembly points in the Canadian maritime.<br/><br/>Initially u-boat commanders took advantage of America&rsquo;s unprepared defenses, hunting easy targets with few patrols and even coastal cities lit up, ignoring wartime blackout precautions; but the Americans quickly mustered their forces for war, increasing their patrols by aircraft and destroyers and ultimately chasing the German u-boats from the East Coast and back into wolf pack formations to prowl the North Atlantic once again.<br/><br/>Operation Drumbeat is a solitaire game in which a player assumes the role of a u-boat commander sent to hunt shipping along America&rsquo;s East Coast in early 1942. The player plots a course on a grid map like the ones used by German submarine captains to travel to the patrol area and hunt targets. A series of charts helps simulate the chances of running into American patrols, encountering freighters and tankers, and attacking them with torpedoes and deck guns. Each turn equals one day; the player tracks the u-boat&rsquo;s progress in a log much like actual German submarine captains used. How many ships can a captain sink before his u-boat runs out of torpedoes&hellip;or luck?<br/><br/>",

But 9&times;9 is all you&rsquo;ll need for a long time.)<br/><br/>The game starts with a set board layout.<br/><br/>The pieces in the corners are called Neutral Pieces.

One player plays pieces black side up, and the other plays them white side up. Starting with Black, the players take turns. On your turn you must either: <br/>A) place a piece on an empty space orthogonally-adjacent to any friendly piece, or <br/>B) move any friendly piece, by a chess queen&rsquo;s move, to any empty space not orthogonally adjacent to any friendly pieces.<br/><br/>2. If you have no legal moves, you must pass.<br/><br/>3. After placing or moving a piece, flip all enemy pieces lying in an uninterrupted straight orthogonal or diagonal row between the piece you placed or moved and any friendly pieces.<br/><br/>4.

(Snype is an attempt to create a Y-like game, without the overwhelming strategic importance of the center spaces.)<br/><br/>Rules<br/>  * To begin, one player places a white stone on any empty space, and the other player decides whether to play as White or Black.<br/>  * From then on, starting with Black, the players take turns. A turn consists of two actions, which may be performed in any order:  1) place a stone of your color on any numbered empty space; and 2) optionally, move a stone in a straight line, any number of spaces up to the number on the space from which it starts, so that it lands on an empty numbered space. No jumping allowed.<br/>  * The game ends when one player creates a connected group of stones which is adjacent to at least one blue, one yellow and one red space. He wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's a variant of Draughts. Changes from the standard game:<br/>1) Jumping over: when an opponent's piece is jumped over, either man or king, the player who made the move picks it up and replaces it in a free square at his choice, but of the opposite color. At the beginning, all pieces are positioned as usual on black squares, but in the following the game evolves in two parallel plays. Those plays are interconnected, since a &ldquo;capture&rdquo; made on squares of a color moves the jumped piece on a square of the opposite color. On his  turn, a player can choose to move a piece either on the white or on the black squares. All the other movement rules remain the same. <br/>2)Promotion: as in the standard game, a man is promoted to king when it reaches the opponent's kings row. The player that gained the promotion must choose one of his other men, remove it from the game and place it on top of the promoted piece. Each promotion makes a king from a pair of men, reducing in that way the overall number of pieces on the board.<br/>3) Goal and scoring: the game is won by the first player that promotes all his men to kings. Each player will score one point for each king he has at the end of the game. A match should be composed of an even number of games, to be started alternately by the players. The winner is the player with the highest overall score.<br/><br/>",

Movement is decided by a spinner which has seven sections, one to six as usual plus a Sandman section. If the Sandman is spun, the player will get an extra turn (spin again and move and then a second spin and move).<br/><br/>At the start each player receives 6 apples which will be needed on the journey. On the path you will collect cards featuring four Nature-Spirits; Thunder, Water, Storm and Little Star. In the latter part of the game you will use these cards to advantage.<br/><br/>Various spaces might demand apples to pass. Generally  you will get a choice, pay X apples to carry on or wait until you land exactly on the space and then you pay less appels. At the end of the game, after you have been fired on to the moon by a cannon (really!), if you get asked for apples and you have none left, you are out of the game. Conservation of your apples is critical.<br/><br/>First to reach the May Beetle's leg, wins.<br/><br/>",

Each suit is represented by a different colour. The cards are numbered 2 to 12.<br/><br/>The player on the left of the dealer begins by taking into his hand the top card from the face&not;down pack on the table. If he has a card in his hand bearing the number 7 he plays it by placing it in the centre of the table. If he has no No. 7 he may not play any other card and the play passes to the next player on his left. The second player draws the next card from the top of the pack and plays either a No. 7 card or, if the first player laid down a 7, the No. 6 or No. 8 of the same colour.<br/>The other players follow in turn, drawing each time and playing one card if they can. The cards must always be played in order on the right or left side of the 7&rsquo;s and in their proper suits in accordance with the colour of the numbers. For numbers under 7 the numerical order goes downwards, for numbers over 7 it goes upwards.<br/><br/>If a player cannot play a card when his turn comes he merely keeps in his hand the card he has drawn from the pack and the turn passes to the next player.<br/><br/>Important rule: PLAYERS MUST PLAY A CARD IF THEY HAVE ONE THAT CAN BE PLAYED BUT MUST NEVER PLAY MORE THAN ONE CARD AT EACH TURN.<br/><br/>The first player to use all his cards, wins.<br/><br/>Reimplements: Fan Tan<br/><br/>",

The game does not seek to simulate the Siege of Khartoum or the battle of Omdurman, but rather small unit combat and tactics.<br/><br/>The scene is the Sudan in the time of Kitchener and Gordon (1880 to 1897). The forces in the conflict during this time had extremely different abilities, methods of fighting, and morale. It varied from the extreme of &quot;crack&quot; British units with rigid discipline to the wild and uncertain Beja tribesmen who relied on ambush, the sword, the dagger, and spear to dispatch opponents.<br/><br/>As with most battle and wargames, including very complex Pentagon computer simulations, random events are part of the game. The winning player, or team,  is often the one who best deals with risk assessment.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is essential that the players have some understanding of chance and probabilities.  This game utilizes both six-sided and 10-sided (percentile) dice to simulate move distances, resolve combat.<br/><br/>",

Military expeditions undertaken to protect and expand the Empire became an accepted facet of Victorian life.  When compared to great military encounters such as the Seven Years War, the Napoleonic Wars, and the unprecedented World Wars of the Twentieth Century, Britain's colonial wars were small affairs. Yet each produced a more prominent and stronger Empire. The entire period is a portrait of British martial zeal.<br/><br/>This is a set of highly playable rules that is well thought out and well tested  The rules allow for the playing of battles covering Britain's colonial wars in Egypt and the Sudan between the years 1881 and 1898. Also included is one introductory scenario and three historically based scenarios.<br/><br/>The rules are designed to play any size action using figure scales between 15mm and 25/30mm,  Modifications for the use of smaller scle figures is easy.

Do you cooperate with your fellow meeple tribes or don the black mantle of the necromeeple and claim power over life and death for yourself?<br/><br/>This card game answers the age old question:  which gaming genre will reign supreme, Euro or Ameritrash?

The cards include many of your favorite game mechanics, zombie tactics and a few surprises.  Do you bide your time in a euro-optimization holding pattern or go for the jugular with a necromeeple power play and brain buffet?<br/><br/>The winner is the player who ends the game with the most meeple survivors or the necromeeple player if zombeeples overrun the island.  Special win conditions, meeple and zombeeple upgrades, and AT superweapons ensure that whoever wins, Meeple Island will never be the same.<br/><br/>Got wood for brains?<br/><br/>",

Each piece has a red side and a gold side; players pick a color prior to starting and place their pieces with their chosen color facing up.<br/><br/>Players take turns moving.  Pieces may be moved to unoccupied adjoining triangles (triangles that share a side, not a point.)  After having moved, if an adjoining triangle is occupied with an opponent's piece, a player may announce an attack, which will result in a capture or a kill of that piece.  Captured pieces are turned over to match the attacking player's color, killed pieces are removed from the board, never to return.  (A captured piece may not be attacked for one turn.)  The outcomes of attacks are determined as such:<br/><br/>Kill    <br/>knight kills knight    <br/>bowman kills bowman    <br/>cannon kills cannon<br/><br/>Capture<br/>knight captures bowman<br/>bowman captures cannon<br/>cannon captures knight<br/><br/>Players may prevent attack by moving a piece in danger to a triangle immediately next to a potential attacker.  (Pieces must move before attacking.)  The winning player captures or kills all of the opponent's pieces.  One optional advanced rule is included, allowing knights to move through the small hexagons that cover the points of all the board's triangles.<br/><br/>",

Players then placed all his pawns as follows: player A, sockets 4e, 4f, 5d, 5e, 5f, 6d, 6e, and 6f; player B, sokets 2b, 2c, 2d, 3, b, 3c, 3d, 4b, and 4c.<br/> The yellow pawn is placed in the central socket (position 4d).<br/><br/><br/>     Game rules:<br/><br/><br/>The game is played over three rounds.<br/><br/>On each round:<br/><br/>On player takes the yellow pawn and places it in front of him. He is the initial player of the current round and makes the first move. Game continues with every player moving a pawn alternatively.<br/><br/>During his turn, a player must move a pawn according to the following rules: pawns can be moved to an adjacent free socket or else jump (in any direction) over a pawn of whatever color onto a free socket behind it. The enemy destination sockets can not be used for jumping. Consecutive jumps are also allowed and the jump direction can be changed as desired during a series of consecutive jumps.<br/><br/>Important: the target sockets must be always accessed orthogonally, i.e., moving the pawn from a socket orthogonally adjacent to a destination socket or else jumping over an occupied socket orthogonally adjacent to the landing destination socket.<br/><br/>Pawns that have reach a destination socket cannot move any longer.<br/><br/>Game end and rating:<br/><br/>The round is over when a player has placed all his pawns in his destination sockets. If this player was the starting player, his opponent can make and additional move. Therefore, it is possible that all pawns from both players have reached the corresponding destination fields at the end of the round.<br/><br/>Any player whose pawns are all placed in his destination field receives points according to the distribution of his pawns:<br/><br/>1 point: 5 pawns are on one side of the destination field, 3 pawns on the other side,<br/><br/>2 points: 4 pawns are on each side without symmetrical arrangement,<br/><br/>3 points: 4 pawns are on each side with symmetrical arrangement.<br/><br/>At the end of the third round, whoever wins the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The starting configuration for four players is as follows: each player selects one board corner and places his nine mole tiles in the square at that corner and the eight squares on the board sides closer to that corner, four tiles on each side of the corner tile. For two players: opposite corners are occupied. For three players: three corners are occupied.<br/><br/>During a player's turn a tile must be moved. The possible moves are:<br/><br/>a) any tile can be moved in all directions (diagonal or orthogonal) to an adjacent empty space but not to a square with a mole cave symbol or with a 'busy' tile on it.<br/><br/>b) Push: a tile is moved onto an occupied square, pushing the original tile in the direction of movement as well as all tiles that were continuously connected to the original tile in the line of movement. If a tile is pushed into a mole cave, it stays there until it is pushed out. It cannot move out on its own. Exception: pushing is not possible if it results in a tile going off the board or else a 'busy' tile would be moved.<br/><br/>When a tile lands in a tunnel entrance, the player must dig immediately, i.e., the token must be placed to any other free tunnel entrance. If a tile is passively pushed to a tunnel entrance, nothing happens during this turn; but if the tile still stands on a tunnel entrance or was pushed on it and it is the player's turn, this must dig immediately.<br/><br/>A player who has occupied all four squares orthogonally adjacent to a mole cave must place a 'busy' tile there; this tile can no longer  be moved, but the four mole tiles are operational beginning the next turn. If a 'busy' tile is placed on a mole cave where there's already a mole tile of whichever color, this tile is removed from the board.<br/><br/>The winner is the first player to place his two 'busy' tiles on two mole caves.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Depleted are a group of minions for the Neverborn. They are mean to complement the Dark Debts crew.<br/><br/>From the Malifaux Tactica wiki page:<br/>The Depleted are basically cheap targets for the Hungering Darknesses.....hunger for Brilliance. He heals more with them, but they take more damage, and they are drawn to models with the Brilliance trait. They're insignificant, unless within LOS of the hungering darkness.<br/><br/>The Depleted are the empty living shells of people who have been using Brilliance for too long, as such they are not combat monsters. They have a below average Cb value with a lower-end damage spread. These low stats can be slightly deceiving however, because the Depleted get a positive flip to damage against models with Brilliance and any model they wound receives one burning token, upping their damage potential a decent amount. This has some possible synergies with Iggy, the only other Neverborn minion who currently uses burning tokens and a Ht 1 Woe who can be taken in a Ten Thunders crew with Lynch.<br/><br/>Reduced to Cinders is a defense trigger with great offensive potential. When killed in melee with this trigger up, the Depleted explodes like a mini-Papa Loco, giving all models within 2&quot; 2 Dg and Brilliance. One important thing to note about this is that the depleted are Hard to Kill - This means you know when they're on one wound, and when they will be killed, so you will know exactly when to cheat in a crow (Preferably a low one), to trigger this.<br/><br/>The Depleted form the throw away tarpits and objective grabbers of Lynch's crew.<br/><br/>They can be startlingly fast once buffed up, capable of pushing 5&quot; towards a model with brilliance, then double walking another 10&quot; (or 12&quot; with The Source up), for a grand total of 15&quot;-17&quot; of movement in a turn, which ignores severe terrain. Although they are Insignificant on their own, this goes away when they have LoS to the Hungering Darkness. When given Reactivate by the Hungering Darkness, these guys can (1) interact with objectives up to 20&quot;-22&quot; away in a single turn, and the loss of such a cheap minion can be an acceptable trade for those final victory points. The push action also allows them to easily escape combat, making them very hard to lock in place.<br/><br/>Reduced to Cinders is an extremely useful way to get the Hungering Darkness into position. The Depleted gets thrown up into the enemy lines and dies, exploding for damage and handing out Brilliance. At the same time the Hungering Darkness comes into play and can activate and attack with all of the Brilliance buffs already in effect. This can only be triggered by enemy attacks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Modern Day Gladiators (MDG) is a pro wrestling-themed game that brings many of the aspects of the wrestling world to bear in one, simple game mechanic. Using a normal deck of playing cards (and a 12-sided dice if you prefer to roll dice instead of flip cards), with a few simple charts that also follow the same mechanic, you can play out a myriad of matches where wrestler's do all the moves you see on TV.<br/> With MDG, you can play solo - booking matches, running segments and interviews, &amp; playing out the matches with run-ins from other wrestlers (or not) - all of which go into making a wrestling show.  The only difference? You won't know how this script is going to play out. Those matches and segments will affect the company you are trying to run, growing it into a global phenomen or watching it crumble before your eyes.<br/> Of course, you can also play in a group adding one, very important element - each person takes the role (or several roles) of a wrestler. Narrate a segment or cut a promo on your opponent and it will impact the mechanics of the game and your wrestler&rsquo;s options in the ring. And once the bell rings, not only does the mechanics allow you to choose what moves your wrestler does, but it gives you a beginning set of tactics drawn from the real-life wrestling world, tactics to attempt (each with their own advantages and disadvantages). As for those not directly involved in the match, they'll be the crowd and impact the match in a very real way.<br/> This FULL RULEBOOK adds several different match-types (cage, extreme, tag, triangle, battle royal). In addition, the advanced rules continue adding depth by introducing aspects to the game mechanic that turn up the realism such as: Counter ability, Weight &amp; Height, Manager's impact, Intimidation,  Stamina (fatigue, injury, tag team fatigue, wearing an opponent down, wrestling with injuries), blood, referees that impact the match, wrestler's individual advantages &amp; disadvantages, how to make a wrestler and let him grow into an Icon of the wrestling world as well as a world for that wrestler to exist - including 21 original, fully illustrated wrestlers existing within a backdrop as wide-open as your imagination.  This world is constantly growing with at least 4 expansions already planned within the game's 1st year.<br/><br/>",

They may not be conditional or contain the word &ldquo;if&rdquo;.<br/>A Change of Situation (COS) may be enemy forces appear, you are fired upon, you receive a message etc. COS happen at every level, so a COS for a brigade is also a COS for every higher level formation.

There are major &ldquo;gray areas&rdquo; but I guess given the nature of the rules that is to be expected. They are clearly meant to be more of a skeleton. For example, they do not spell out if you remove strips or just track casualties on a roster. They refer to many events but do not spell out how they are to be handled - that is left up to the ruling of an umpire or to be worked out between the players.<br/><br/>These are especially tempting for playing big battles in small spaces.

The in-game economy being 100% player driven, much of the strategy involved consists of being the player who can control and predict the market price of the different manufacturing goods.<br/><br/>From buying of the manufacturing goods to selling the finished product, the players control everything that was involved in manufacturing hats in the 1850&rsquo;s. Market fluctuations are powerful tools for those who know how to wield them and clever use of capital will triumph over rigid business plans.<br/><br/>Will you become a household name in men&rsquo;s fashion, or another bankrupt company soon forgotten by history?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publishers homepage:<br/><br/>The next big release for the year occurs with Catalyst&rsquo;s publication of Shadowrun: Sprawl Gangers, a tactical miniatures game designed by Ross Watson and Randall N. Bills.<br/><br/>Sprawl Gangers is a competitive, skirmish-level miniatures game for 2 players, with everything needed to game right in the box. Players will take on the task of building gangs (Ancients, Halloweeners, First Nation, and so on) following specific point values of a scenario, and modifying the various miniatures based upon what new resources (weapons/gear/magic/tech) a player gained through previous games. Gangs won&rsquo;t simply fight for the sake of fighting, but will actively building their turfs and resources. Among other things, this will allow for the hiring of the exact right shadowrunner when they need that ace in the hole. All this adds up to the experience of watching your gang grow and expand through exciting play across a swath of games.<br/><br/>Sprawl Gangers will be sculpted and manufactured in conjunction with CoolMiniOrNot, who have run three of the most successful miniatures game Kickstarter projects to date: Zombicide, Relic Knights, and Sedition Wars.<br/><br/>&ldquo;We could not be more excited to be a part of this new facet of Shadowrun. When we initially started talking about the possibility of doing a Shadowrun miniatures game with Catalyst, I personally jumped for joy. We have some big fans of Shadowrun in the Cool Mini family; so you know Sprawl Gangers will be receiving some major blood, sweat and tears from our staff. Old and new Shadowrun fans alike would do well to expect great things from Sprawl Gangers,&rdquo; said Kevin Clark, Director of Research and Development at Cool Mini Or Not.<br/><br/>",

Whoever succeeds wins the game. Draws can also occur (if both players have an equal number of game pieces on the board without the possibility of a decision).<br/><br/>Turn and stroke options:<br/>Each piece can move a field in a horizontal, vertical or diagonal direction (forward and backward). Capturing pieces is done by jumping over them.<br/>If the opponent refuses a stroke or overlooks the pawn that had to be caught, his pawn must be removed from the board (the so-called blow).

Lower rank cards have special abilities which can change who wins, however, so players must choose wisely.<br/><br/>Players score based on their accumulated reward cards at the end of the game. There are four sets of reward cards that score based on how many of the set a player collected, and location cards that are always worth 3 points each but some of which can double the value of the collected set cards as well.<br/><br/>The game was originally made as a gift for a friend of the designer, themed around the stories from her web comic series (Arcana Jayne).  Both sets of cards are available here to print &amp; play.<br/><br/>",

It was a silver coin, a bit larger than a dime, bearing the image of the reigning emperor and denarii (plural form of denarius) have been found bearing the image of all 12 Roman emperors.  While competing in the game, you will be given 12 denarii to help you along.<br/><br/>On your turn you role two custom dice and move your marker farther along the track on the board.  Depending on what color you land on you will be asked a different question from the trivia book.  Answer correct and you stay where you are, answer incorrectly and you must return to the last denarii space that you passed or pay a denarii from your supply.  To land on the last space you must role the exact number of spaces needed to get there or you can move backwards to give yourself more room.<br/><br/>Denarii was created to help individuals, groups and especially families increase their Bible knowledge and have fun together at the same time.  Learning is the main purpose, but there is competition, strategy, challenge and lots of excitement, too.<br/>Even if a player does not give all correct answers, he will learn from others and could still be the winner of the game! There is little advantage for the Bible scholar.  Everyone who plays will learn and want to play again!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A free game that came with a Japanese anime magazine.<br/><br/>The game uses the anime show Dancouga as the background setting.<br/><br/>It is a simple 1 to 4 player Solitaire/co-op game.  Players pick one of the four main character of the anime show, each of which has different set of traits.<br/><br/>All characters have a Movement Allowance and Combat Strength.  Combat Strength increases during the game with accumulated &quot;power&quot;.<br/><br/>The map have 37 hexes divided into 6 areas.  Most hexes are marked with an enemy strength and event name.  At the start of each turn, a player rolls two dice: one indicates which area and the other indicates in which hex of the area the event happens.  The player moves his character counter on the map to encounter the enemy marked there.<br/><br/>Comparing the combat strength of the character and the enemy, the higher side wins.  The character will get the stated number of &quot;power&quot; if he wins.<br/><br/>The players win the game once there are no more active events on the map.  The players lose if 40 turns pass without them meeting that victory condition.<br/><br/>Component:<br/>A rule book (also a characters and mechanical design art book of the anime show)<br/>Counter sheet (at the back cover of the rule book, the counters must be cut out before play)<br/>A map (the other side of the map is a poster of the other anime show, Zeta Gundam, not related to the game)<br/>Six-side dice are required but not included in the game<br/><br/>",

Like in Oneonta Whist, this game involves precise bidding, and can be played with 2 players and also cooperatively for up to 7 players.  Variant rules for solitaire play are included, but the nature of dominoes makes the solitaire play not as good as that in regular Oneonta Whist.<br/><br/>The Domino part of the name comes from the game use dominoes or a deck of playing cards that are dominoes.  In this a player would end up leading with a card, and announce which of the two sides is the suit, and the other side is the value in the suit.  Players would follow the same.<br/><br/>The trump suit is determined by flipping over one of the no pip cards.<br/><br/>In addition, players can bid to take as many tricks as they can take, and lose what they bid if they fail to make it, or make what they bid if they make as many tricks as the bid, and lose one point for each trick more.<br/><br/>",

They search for a given position of the eyes (open, closed or wink), the site of an accessory (for clothing, wall or background) and the shape of the corners of the card (rounded, straight or angled).<br/>- Children from 5 to 6 years play with the blue set of dice and find a map with some fingers in (1-2-3), the letters p-b-d on clothing and the direction of the nose (left, right or down).<br/><br/>There are two variants to play the game:<br/>1)Either each child receives equal cards and places it in front of him.

In the upper field of his game sheet, each player lays out a network (without letting his opponent see it) consisting of six lines - each of a different length, ranging from one to six grid unit lengths, inclusive. The lines must be drawn either horizontally or vertically, must be connected together (in any order), and must turn at right angles at each connection point. The lines may not touch each other except to where one ends and another starts. Illustrations 1 and 2 show networks that tin have been laid out correctly. Illustration 3 shows an incorrectly drawn network. (See images for the examples.<br/><br/>Play<br/>1.    One player spies by asking the opponent about the contents of a space in the opponent&rsquo;s field (such as<br/>1A, 2B and so on). If there is a line - or two connecting lines - in that space, the opponent announces: &lsquo;hot&rsquo;.<br/>If there is no line in that space, but it is adjacent to a space containing a line, the opponent announces: &lsquo;warm&rsquo;. Squares which touch diagonally are not considered adjacent for this purpose. In all other cases, the opponent announces&lsquo;cold&rsquo;. The opponent then asks about the contents of a space and the first player replies, thereby completing a round.<br/>2.    Each player uses the lower field on his game sheet for keeping track of information he obtains by spying.<br/>3.    In any round a player may, instead of spying on a single space, spy on from two to five connected spaces belonging to a single horizontal or vertical row. Whenever a player makes use of multiple spying, he must cross out below his upper field a square containing a number equal to the number of squares spied upon that turn. A player whose six numbered squares have all been crossed out may no longer use multiple spying, and the<br/>opponent should keep track of this by using the squares under his own lower field.<br/><br/>At the end of any round either or both players may try to reconstruct their opponent&rsquo;s network. A correct reconstruction counts as a single victory for the player. An incorrect reconstruction counts as a double victory for the opponent. (Thus it is possible for a tie to occur or for one player to win as much as a triple victory.) A player , who has made an incorrect secret construction or given the opponent incorrect information, automatically loses.<br/><br/>If the horizontal two-unit line in Illustration 1 were moved one grid unit to the right and connected with the four-unit line rather than the one-unit line, identical information would be obtained from spying. In such a case, either reconstruction would be considered correct.<br/><br/>Variation<br/>Advanced players may agree to use more lines. Even the addition of an extra one-unit line greatly increases the strategic complexity.<br/><br/>",

One special agent card is also included which, when played, automatically entitles the player to arrest any one of the wanted outlaws.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to collect three of the wanted outlaws.<br/><br/>Place all the wanted cards face up in a circle in the centre of the table.<br/>Each player takes a gun and places it in front of himself on the table.<br/>Choose a dealer, who shuffles the rest of the cards and deals them out one at a time face down to each player until the pack is finished. Each player then stacks the cards face down in front of himself .The player to the left of the dealer starts the game by playing the top card of his hand face up in front of himself. Play continues in a clockwise direction.<br/>When any player turns over a card which he thinks is a wanted man, he should shout &quot;Ambush&quot; and go for his gun.The one who sees the wanted man first obviously has the advantage but he does not win the wanted card until he shoots any one of the players who have now become the outiaws. The one that shoots and scores first wins the wanted card and places it in front of himself. Should the player accidentally shoot the wrong sharp shooting character he should either:-<br/>1.    miss a go if he holds no wanted cards and be shot by the other players or<br/>2.    lose one of his wanted cards and place it back in the centre of the table and be shot by the other players.<br/>When the players have played all their cards the dealer should shuffle the cards and deal them out as above.<br/>The winner is the first person to collect three wanted cards.<br/><br/>",

You are a veteran pilot piloting a heavily armed prototype fighter spacecraft, the &quot;Exterminator&quot;. Equipped with state of the art laser and shielding technology, your piloting skills and the &quot;Exterminator&quot; are the only way to stop the armada of invaders and save humankind from certain damnation. Will you be able to stop the Xenoid intruders?<br/><br/>This card game for one player tries to emulate the gameplay of classic arcade-style top-down space shooters. You control a spaceship that starts with 3 Lives, 3 Shields and a Weapon with Power 1. You are facing an armada of enemy (Xenoid) Spacecraft which move downwards towards you while you try to destroy as many of them as possible by performing one out of 3 actions each turn: Move - Shoot - Charge (your Weapon).<br/><br/>The Game features 5 Waves (Levels) with enemies becoming stronger and more numerous as you advance through the stages. <br/>You collect Power Ups (such as Weapon or Shield Upgrades or additional Lives etc) which pop up at random when enemy crafts are destroyed. In between stages you can buy Power Ups by spending points you acccumulated during the Waves. Each destroyed enemy goes to the Score Pile and may be used to pay for Power Ups in between Waves.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is twofold: The primary goal is to survive all five Waves. When all your shields are depleted you lose one life, and when all lives are lost it means &quot;Game Over&quot;. The secondary goal is to strive for the highest possible score by destroying as many Xenoid ships as possible. Again you score points for every destroyed enemy spaceship.

        "description": "This is definitely one of those games where the name directed the mechanic. The concept of karma &ndash; good and bad, owing or being owed a debt, and both being a responsibility &ndash; and a meta game element of card destruction (making every deck unique) and Real World &trade; consequences (in the form of a verbal contract to play) sort of came after the pun of Karma and Armageddon.<br/><br/>The most important part of this game concept is that players may &ldquo;help&rdquo; you, even when you don&rsquo;t want it, and that this will exact a real consequence to clear the debt. Of course, like a gambling debt, this isn&rsquo;t enforceable. However, entering into the spirit of the thing is the whole point. Why cheat? You&rsquo;re only robbing yourself&hellip;<br/><br/>Set up<br/>There are two elements to this game:<br/><br/>1) A card game played with (what starts out at least as) a standard deck of cards. If there are Jokers, bridge rules or instruction cards, include them.<br/><br/>2) Redemption of Debt where cards used to help other players are IOUs for an hour of a player&rsquo;s time on any reasonable, legal and responsible task.<br/><br/>To play (the first time) a Sharpie or permanent marker and a standard deck of cards (with jokers) is necessary for 2-4 players. For more than 4 players an extra deck of cards is added for each additional player up to 8 maximum; ideally this should have a different back design or be different size to allow separation for future 2-4 player games. These cards will be torn, ripped and marked, so will likely not be useful for other games afterwards.<br/><br/>NOTE: a deck where cards are missing (otherwise useless!) is fine as a starting deck. Subsequent play will likely not have all the cards anyway, so one or two missing now won&rsquo;t matter. Reuse/Recycling!!! I feel better already!<br/><br/>Set up for the Meta-Game (the redemption of favours) is merely the agreement of all players that they will commit to an hour of time helping one another for each &ldquo;Debt Card&rdquo; they end up with. Where this occurs in game, the card will be ripped in two and both parts signed by helper and helpee; its recommended that a phone number or email address for each is also written down, unless players are well acquainted. The helpee then uses their half in play (for that game only) and later as a reminder that they owe a favour. The helper keeps their half to call in the debt.<br/><br/>NOTE: The hour of time and the task are to be mutually agreed between helper and helpee. It could be anything crom mowing a lawn, babysitting, fixing a computer, whatever is acceptable and doable.<br/><br/>NOTE 2: Debts do NOT cancel out. If Mike owes Paco a debt and vice versa, they don&rsquo;t call it quits. They both do an hour for the other. This is a matter of honour!<br/><br/>Once a debt is paid, &ldquo;Done&rdquo; is written on the helpers half and &ldquo;Paid&rdquo; is written on the helpees half. Cards can be kept as a memento, burned ceremoniously or binned.<br/><br/>",

The next player can either accept the package, add cards and pass it on, or doubt that the assets cover the debt cards. The wronged player gets permanent debts, and at the end of the game, the player with the lowest debts wins. <br/>Each player also has a rating that influences his/her hand cards, so the challenge is not entirely an uninformed decision.<br/><br/>",

Each player must maintain four cards in hand at all times. There are four &quot;suites&quot; (in red and black) corresponding to each of the four types of vehicles. The first player plays a card in the suite of his/her choice, announces the card and plays it face up. The player then draws from the deck to replenish the hand. The other players follow, and the player who played the highest value card in the suite lead gets to move the associated piece that number of spaces forward along the corresponding route. If a player does not have a card of the suite lead, they must play another card from another suite. The used cards are placed in a discard pile and shuffled if the draw pile is depleted.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game revolves around the changing patterns of sunspots during their approximately 11-year cycles. Each player has 11 wooden disks in one color. The circular board is divided into eleven sectors grouped into two areas: a 6-sector zone where players try to have as much sunspots as possible, and a 5-sector area, where the aim is to place as few sunspots as possible. Sunspots are represented by pips on dice faces. Each sector shows a rating number (5,8,9,10,13 or 15 in the 'max' sectors, and 9,10, 11, 13 or 17 in the 'min' sectors).<br/><br/>There are three standard dice to roll and ca. 60 small dice used to represent sunspots. The 11 sectors are divided into two circular annuli (outer and inner ring), one for each player.<br/>Players alternate rolling three dice (1-3 dice can be rolled one additional time, if the player so wishes). The final three rolled values are added to produce a number of 'sunspots' that are then placed on any free sector in the player's ring. If the opponent has the same number of sunspots in the inner or outer adjacent ring, the sunspots from both sectors are removed. If both players have different number of sunspots in the two fields on a given sector, the player with the higher (in a 'max' sector) or lower (in a 'min' sector) number wins the sector, which changes the turn order so that it's now this player's turn again. At the end of the game, players add the rating values of the sectors they have won. The player with the highest rating is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Players may sneak through the castle or fight, but must be careful as the enemy is actively searching for them. As the players succeed, they gain ingenuity, which can be used to increase their arsenal of equipment or gain new skills for use in the search for the lord. Combat against enemy units has a wound mechanism that allows players to weaken their enemy before dealing a final blow and characters also have the use of mystical ki to help them overcome the obstacles ahead of them. Players must be careful though as the enemy gains strength in numbers. Players must find a way to survive long enough to locate defeat the lord to claim victory. In the end, only one player can be declared the victor &ndash; the one who defeats the lord!<br/><br/>Era of the Ninja comes with multiple levels of play from Basic for new players to Advanced, which increases the challenge for veteran players. There are also different modes of play from Regular play, True co-op mode, Death Match, Team Death Match, and Head of the Lord allowing players the ability to choose their favorite type of game and play style.<br/><br/>",

You can attack a Locust if it is in range of a weapon you have. Or you can use a special, like Sofia's stim grenade, which revives teammates.<br/><br/>After players move, the Locust spawn and advance, attacking barriers that are in their way, except for the Wretch, which can leap right over them. Locusts attack following the same rules.<br/><br/>Combat is simple. Roll die equal to your power. Each dice equal to your accuracy scores a hit. Each hit deals the weapons damage.<br/><br/>Locusts have special abilities, and the rule book dictates when to use them.<br/><br/>Be careful. Each Locust is different. The Ticker can easily destroy barriers, and self-destruct. The Wretch can leap over barriers and climb into perches. The Drone has grenades, and Kantus heals his comrades. <br/>The even more powerful Locust can do things from spit acid to dig underground.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Times Su Doku is a tile placement game which allows either solo puzzle solving or two player competitive game play. Su Doku (or Sudoku) is a mathematical puzzle which consists of a grid of 9 3x3 squares. The completed puzzle has the digits 1 to 9 in each 3x3 square and the digits 1 to 9 in each row and column in the grid. The game poses a number of partially complete grids which must be completed correctly and can be used in either the solo puzzle or two player game.<br/><br/>The solo mode allows a player to attempt to correctly complete a Su Doku. This function of the set is not technically a game and is actually solo puzzle solving.<br/><br/>The two player mode sees both players attempting to complete the same puzzle in the same grid. Players may place a tile as soon as they are sure that the placement is correct; there is no turn sequence. The players race to place as many correct tiles as possible before the whole puzzle is complete. The winning player is the one who placed the largest number of correct tiles in the puzzle, less the number of incorrect tiles which they placed. The tiles are double sided and are printed with a different colour on each side to allow players to identify which tiles were placed by which player.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Spekulatius is a variant of the classic trick-taking game Oh Hell!.  The deck consists of four suits with cards in each suit numbered 1-20 and four jokers.  In each round of the game, players are dealt a certain number of cards -- for a typical game this starts at ten cards for the first round and one fewer each successive round, until the tenth round when players only receive one card, and then in each round thereafter players receive one more card per round until the nineteenth round where players again receive ten.<br/><br/>In each round, a card is turned up from the deck to show what suit is trump and players must speculate how many tricks they will take in the round.  Players must follow suit of the lead card when possible, and can play off or trump when they have a void in the lead suit.  The player who played the highest on-suit card or trump wins the trick and leads the next trick.<br/><br/>Jokers occupy a special space in the game -- they can always be played, and when the player plays a Joker, he or she announces whether it is &quot;top&quot; -- which means it is the best card that can be played, or &quot;flop&quot; which means it dodges the trick.  When more than one player plays a Joker in a round, the last-played Joker is controlling, meaning it would &quot;top&quot; a previously-played &quot;top&quot; joker.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, players score points based on how many tricks they took, one point per trick.  Players that successfully speculated their bid exactly receive a ten-point bonus to their score; thus an exactly-made bid of 3 nets 13 points, or an exactly-made bid of 0 nets 10 points.  The game is played over nineteen rounds (or ten for a short game), and the player with the highest score total is the winner.<br/><br/>The game lists that it is playable up to eleven people, but the deck of cards only has 84 in it.  The rules suggest with more people that players use the same progression of hands with fewer cards per player on the largest hands (e.g., thirteen rounds with eleven players, progressing 7-6-5 . . . 5-6-7).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the PDF:<br/>&quot;SeaWar: 1805 is a set of wargames rules designed to recreate the naval battles that occur during the Age of Sail, from the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652 through the Napoleonic Wars to the end of the Greek War of Independence in 1829.<br/>Designed to be simple enough to introduce gamers new to the period (indeed even to wargaming), SeaWar: 1805 is challenging enough to provide experienced naval wargamers with hours of fun and even provide the ideal vehicle to introduce their &ldquo;landlubber&rdquo; friends to the joys of naval wargaming. &quot;<br/><br/>A relatively simple miniatures system with rules for wind effects on movement, deterioration of ship capabilities with damage (with possible random effects), broadsides, bow &amp; stern fire, and 7 classes of ships (with further sub-classes for finer detail). Movement is phased, 5 phases per game turn, each ship moving between 0 and 4 cm per phase. Bookkeeping fairly light, supplied record sheets gives 2 ships per sheet with generous space for writing in ship capabilities &amp; damage. Rules include many photographs of game in play, but only a couple have rules purposes, the others being decorative only. Time scale is 5 minutes per game turn, movement scale not given - all measurements are standard regardless of scale/size of miniatures used, 1/1200 scale being recommended.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a bluffing game that's especially popular in some Swedish student circles. After poker dice were introduced in the late 19th century it may have evolved from the similar game Mia to using five dice and poker hand combinations. It's usually played using poker dice, although normal dice can be used just as well. There's no real upper bound to the number of players except for practical considerations.<br/><br/>The first player to start a round rolls five dice in a cup, looks at them and names a scoring combination. These include five of a kind, four of a kind, full house, straight (&quot;big&quot; or &quot;small&quot;), three of a kind, two pairs, and one pair; aces beat kings and so on; if a combination doesn't include all five dice, then the best die among the remainder is also named (e.g. &quot;aces and tens, king high&quot;).<br/><br/>The next player in a clockwise direction, receiving the cup, must then decide whether she believes the claim. If not, she lifts the cup to expose the dice underneath. If she accepts the claim, she must then aim to produce a higher combination (or at least make the next player think she has); to this end she may redistribute the dice between the cup and the table and then reroll either the open or the hidden dice before making a new claim.<br/><br/>Once a claim is challenged, if it was a bluff the bluffer loses a life and the caller begins the next round. If the claim was true, the caller loses a life and the next player clockwise starts the next round. Typically players begin with three lives and are out of the game when they are all lost, although it's also possible to have just the one life (especially with lots of players).<br/><br/>There are of course different variant details, procedural conventions and betting systems. One variant might be to have five lives, stake two lives on a call, and allow players to &quot;fold&quot; and end a round at the cost of a single life. A simple betting method is that for each round they remain in the game a player must make a contribution to the pot; the last remaining player takes the pot.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Table Top Championship Golf is as close to real golf as you can get with dice and paper. Using a grid matrix system, each Championship golf mat has over 550 possible landing locations for your ball. Never before in a golf board game has the player been able to use so much of the hole. Coupled with a wind modifier, frustratingly placed hazards and plenty of trees this game is bound to bring you just as much joy, and sometimes frustration, as the real thing.<br/><br/>Play by yourself just to pass the time, or play with some friends. TTCG can be played with a full foresome and has many different game modes such as Stroke Play, Skins, Scramble, Best Ball, Fourball and more. Have your own favorite method of play? Play it! Want to make up a new game type? Give it a shot.<br/><br/>With 32 hole options, there are 471,435,600 possible course combinations to choose from. Have a favorite hole? Play it more than once. Don't have time for 18? Play a quick game of 9 hole.<br/><br/>We've included 18 scorecards with the game, if you run out, we've provided a link on this page to print out more.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Swytch, the second in the BGO series by designer Nathan Hansen, is a symmetrically balanced abstract strategy game for 2 players. Each player has two types of Counters: Hexagonal and Circular. Hexagonal counters can move in 3 directions, while Circular counters can move in all 6 directions.<br/><br/>Each player tries to outmaneuver and eliminate all of the opposing player's pieces on the board. To do this, they can do one of three things on their turn. They can either: Move/Attack with a counter or stack of counters, prepare a stack of Hexagonal counters for an advanced move with changing directions, or &quot;Swytch&quot; (i.e., change the orientation of a Stack of Hexagonal counters, and thus what directions they can move). Every time that a player attacks with a stack of counters, they MUST also Swytch with that stack immediately after.<br/><br/>The number of spaces a stack of counters can move/attack is determined by its height. When a player attacks by moving into an opponents stack, they reduce the size of the target's stack of counters by the size of their own. If this is enough to eliminate the target, they do so. If not, they are forced to stop one space short and also reduce the size of their stack by 1.<br/><br/>Deeply strategic and full of possibilities, get the upper hand in Swytch!<br/><br/>Game Data:<br/><br/>Complexity: 5 on a 9 scale<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 2 on a 9 scale<br/><br/>Polybag Game Components:<br/><br/>&bull;    One 8-page full-color Rules booklet <br/>&bull;    One 8.5&rdquo; x 11&rdquo; game map<br/>&bull;    52 two-sided, multi-shaped game pieces<br/><br/>",

It is intended to be played with paper miniatures printed in 1/72 or 1/76 scale. To that end, the rules<br/>are kept deliberately easy to learn. This does not mean the rules are unsophisticated. Players will find that good tactics are generally rewarded. Paper Tigers uses a standard deck of playing cards to generate an interesting and sometimes surprisingly tense turn sequence. Higher value cards allow you to act first, but they are more difficult to successfully use. Lower value cards are easier to use, but with them, you are more likely to act after your opponent. Most players! initial games are likely to be solo efforts. This does not pose a problem as Paper Tigers is purposely designed to work well in singleplayer games. The card-driven turn sequence combined with other mechanisms that limit player control make Paper Tigers highly suitable for solo play yet still provide an enjoyable multi-player game.&quot;<br/><br/>",

This scenario supplement is based on the results of the famous 1974 wargame conducted at Sandhurst under the watchful umpiring eye of Dr Paddy Griffith, with fourteen scenarios designed for company sized engagements using I Ain't Been Shot Mum.<br/><br/>The initial section of the supplement looks at the German and British plans, detailing the troops involved and their means of operation.  There are then fourteen scenarios, each of which includes a colour map of the terrain, individual briefings for both sides and a set of umpire's notes for the game organiser.<br/><br/>",

The Clubs and Spades have teamed up against the Diamonds and Hearts. Unlike traditional WAR, cards are not revealed at random. Instead, players are able to choose the card or cards they would like to play in a variety of combinations. As each battle is fought, the losing side loses their cards and victory will come to the player with cards left standing. Trying to keep your best cards together could be a great strategy but beware the Royal Assassins and the Suicide Bomber disguised as the Aces and Joker respectively.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BancoBanco is a colourful card game that can be played with 2-4 players. Each player starts the game with four banks and four vaults in the colors red, green, blue and yellow. All the players also have a personal vault where they can save their precious cards.<br/><br/>The game is played with two types of cards: point cards and Banco cards. The point cards have a color, value and 1-3 symbols. These cards are used to score points or to invest in the banks. The Banco cards, which have a color and a bonus, are used only to close a bank. A player's turn has three phases. First, the active player can steal a card from an opponent by asking for it (color, value or a combination of both). Second, the player takes two actions, which can be playing cards on a bank and/or vault, saving cards in the personal vault, taking your personal vault to your hand, or burning cards. Finally, the player brings his hand back to five cards.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible in the vaults and secure these points by closing the banks. When a bank is closed, all players must close their vault of the same color, so no points can be scored anymore. When all vaults are closed, the game ends and points are counted.<br/><br/>",

Noir Nights is a deck building game where players use Leads and Arrest Evidence points on cards in their deck to arrest Mobsters. It offers a dynamic play experience where players have to react and adjust their strategy accordingly.<br/><br/>Game play is similar to other deck building games, with the player adding cards to their deck by &quot;purchasing&quot; them from a central deck, which has the top three cards revealed and available for purchase. When cards are removed, they are replaced with a new one from the top of the deck. Badge Honor points are earned in two ways: 1)Some Assets/Policemen cards acquired during game play are worth one or more Badge Honor points; 2) Badge Honor points can be gained by arresting Mobsters with Arrest Evidence Points featured on several of the Asset/Policeman cards.<br/><br/>",

If he instead draws a token matching a card in front of another player, well, he just helped that player get one step closer to victory as he must place the token of the card anyway. The player with the die rolls it repeatedly, possibly needing to jump up then sit back down, possibly needing to switch hands. As soon as she rolls her second dwarf, she passes the die to the closest player clockwise, who must then start rolling while she tries to fish tokens from the bag.<br/><br/>As soon as someone has tokens on all of her cards, she wins the game! (Players can also play without the die, with everyone fishing for tokens at the same time.)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is a draughts or checkers game for a 3-D board of the type popularized by the TV and film franchise Star Trek. The rules for that game including how the board works can be found at the following link on Chess Variants:<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.chessvariants.org/3d.dir/startrek.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.chessvariants.org/3d.dir/startrek.html</a><br/><br/>Play begins with black pieces on all dark squares of the lowest fixed board and similarly on the two movable boards which start adjacent to it. To move a movable board, it must be empty at the time but with that proviso one can on a turn either move a movable exactly as in 3-D chess (explained below for clarity) or move a piece. The rules are exactly as in standard draughts (checkers) otherwise.<br/><br/>A big difference is that the movable board which start with white pieces begin BELOW, not above, the upper fixed board and movable boards start away from the player.<br/><br/>How the board works:<br/>3 checkered 4x4 boards with a white square on the near right corner for either player are in fixed positions at levels 2, 4 and 6. The lateral edges are aligned but the three fixed boards are staggered so that the nearer two rows of the middle fixed board (at level 4) exactly overlap the farther two rows of the fixed board nearer to either player. The fixed board on which the black player has pieces starting is at level 2 and thus lower than the middle board. Similarly the fixed board on which white pieces start are at level 6 and thus above the middle fixed board.<br/><br/>4 movable checkered 2x2 boards with a white space in the nearer right corner are also included. Two of these boards start at level 3 with one corner each overlapping either of the two corners of the fixed board at level 2 farther away from the black player so that the other 3 spaces of the movable boards are not over that same fixed board; these two movable boards start filled with black pieces. Similarly 2 movable board start at level 5 filled with white pieces, and these board start with one corner overlapping either of the two corners of the fixed board at level 6 farther away from the white player. The other three squares are not under that same fixed board.<br/><br/>Levels 1 and 7 start empty. A variant of the game makes all the board fixed in their initial positions. When movement of movable board is allowed, an empty movable board can be moved up or down 2 levels (but not above level 7 or below level 1) in which case it switches between above or below the same corner of a given fixed board. Without changing level, the movable board can be moved to a position above or below the other corner along the same edge of a fixed board as it already occupies. So a movable board at level 7 above the back right corner of the fixed board at level 6 can if empty be moved to above the back left or front right corner of the board at level 6, assuming of course no other movable board is already there.<br/><br/>Spaces directly above or below each other will have the same color.<br/><br/>Pieces' moves general conventional draughts moves to 3-D as follows. One looks at the board from above and flattens it. If the piece could move onto a space in this flattened version of the board, it can move onto it so long as a piece does not skip a level. Namely, in a non-capturing move, one cannot move directly from level 4 to level 6 and one can only do so in a capturing move if jumping a piece on a board at level 5.<br/><br/>What playing is like:<br/>It sounds harder than it is but does take some getting used to. The board geometry makes things interesting.<br/><br/>",

Base level gives nothing.<br/><br/>Starting player is chosen randomly and each player chooses and places their starting card in front of them; they may search the deck and choose any card between 2 and 7. Play then proceeds clockwise.<br/><br/>On your turn you take a card either from the top of the deck or the top of the discard pile or may pass. If you take a card you must either use it to build on your wall or discard the card. The discard pile is public and anyone may see the order of the cards there, but not change the order.<br/>You can build in two ways, either going up a level or widening the base level. Each card has a value between 1 and 14, with jack, queen and king being 11, 12 and 13 and ace being both 1 and 14 (you choose in each instant). The joker's value is determined by its position.<br/><br/>When widening your base level you may place your card at either end of your wall if the sum of that card and the adjacent card is 14 or less. You may not use jokers in this way.<br/><br/>When building up, you place your card above 2 adjacent cards of the level below, but your card must be equal to the sum of those cards. Jokers may be used as any other card when building up - its value is then determined by those two cards below it. The joker cannot have a value higher than 14, but it can be considered an ace (value 14 and 1) if the lower cards you build on have that sum.<br/><br/>Example: You have a base level of 7, 7, 6, 2 and a queen. You then have the possibility for a level 1 of ace(7+7), king(7+6), 8(6+2) and ace(2+12). Level 2 would be ace(1+13), nothing(13+8=21) and 9(8+1). No further levels is this case. The score would be 0 for base level + 4 for the 4 cards in level 1 + 4 for the 2 cards in level 2 = 8 points.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Cosmos, players take turns exploring the universe, building far-flung colonies, and collecting taxes (for once, we're on the right side of taxes!).  The goal of the game is to make the most money from the economic opportunities of exploring space, while elbowing out the market competition.  Central market mechanics allow players to compete by increasing or decreasing universal resource prices, while limited resources make each region of space a hotly-contested competition for colonies.  The game ends when the universe is totally explored--meaning if you're sitting in dead last without a hope, you can explore your heart out and rush the game to an untimely conclusion.<br/><br/>Cosmos is very straightforward to learn, and a typical game takes around 30-45 minutes. Cosmos is simple enough for casual gamers to play (and win), but complex enough to keep the interest of more competitive or experienced gamers. Turns are quick, and the game mechanics are easy to remember.<br/><br/>Most conflict in Cosmos is indirect, making this a great game for two players--even those who may be mismatched in competitive nature or gaming experience (read: the hobbyist and the spouse). At the same time, Cosmos allows up to eight players, making it a decent party game, although it gets a bit crowded and far more competitive at six.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a highly replayable, very entertaining game with a really broad appeal and low commitment requirements.<br/><br/>",

Four members of the colony have been given CRMA (Combat-Ready Mechanized Armor), highly upgradeable equipment that they'll use to protect their colony and fight off the Boss Squad.<br/><br/>In this solo roguelike game, players work through the card deck, fighting enemies and dealing with events around the colony. The order of these is randomized through shuffling, and each encounter is removed from the deck after resolution. Cards also act as items that the player can attach to their CRMA to increase their effectiveness, trade at caravans for other items, or break down during combat to influence dice rolls. Card backs are used as vital stats indicators, and two of these are removed from each game for the player character, further randomizing each game experience.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to build up your CRMA's strength to the point where you can defeat three Boss characters in combat. If you run from three Bosses, you lose. If you only defeat two bosses and the deck runs out, you still win.<br/><br/>",

The real treasures however are those that jump and fly - the rare brown squirrels, cranes, egrets and eagles who make their homes in remote locations. These hard to find creatures are the ultimate destination of any tour of the countryside.<br/><br/>In Gaido, players take on the role of guides and travelers journeying through the countryside of medieval Japan. Guide duties are shared, with each player taking the responsibility for one day of their journey. The guide directs the group of players through the Japanese landscape, to their journey&rsquo;s end. Only the current guide can decide when a journey is over.<br/><br/>There are four animals the group is trying to spot, squirrels, cranes, egrets and eagles. These animals are found in four different locations and represent the end of a journey. On the play table, players will create four stacks of cards, called Journeys. These stacks represent the different paths to the four animals.<br/><br/>Every Journey card has a Kanji symbol on it which indicates how many points each player will receive when that stack is scored. Cards can be played facing any direction. There are sixteen Journey cards and four Journey&rsquo;s End cards which, when played on one of the four journeys will immediately end that journey and score that stack of cards.<br/><br/>Gaido offers interesting play choices, with a strategy that&rsquo;s deeper than it first appears and a simple play style. Only 20 cards and 24 counters in size, it&rsquo;s played in an average of 15-20 minutes.<br/><br/>",

The goal of the game is to build a pagoda with specially designed cards without causing the structure to collapse.  The pasteboard box the game comes in serves as a base for the building with gauges that ensure that the first story is correctly formed. It seems complex with rules for attempting to replace partial collapse and foul placement of cards.<br/><br/>",

The game is based on the Greek Stock market of the 90s and the press of the era.<br/><br/>It has many similarities to Monopoly, but in place of real estate now there are company shares. Houses and hotels are replaced by percentage of the company in stocks, owned by the player. Paying money based on stocks they own to other players as well as various taxes and public service bills may cost money to the players similar to monopoly.<br/><br/>An interesting change is the fact that two players can merge their shares in order to get a bigger percentage payment from other players.<br/><br/>The goal of course is to take out of business your opponents by causing them to go bankrupt.<br/><br/>",

As you battle opposing fire departments, pull out all the stops to gain control of the most districts by collecting equipment, sabotaging opponents, and successfully completing fire calls to win the game.&quot;<br/><br/>The game objective is to become the Fire Department (player) with the most occupied districts by collecting and using the necessary equipment to complete Fire Calls. Once all the districts are covered, the Fire Department with the most occupied districts wins the game.<br/><br/>On their turn, players roll the die and move their markers along the track. The space they land on can have one of a number of effects. Players may gain fire equipment, have the opportunity to complete a fire call and occupy a district, gain cards for special effects later or sustain on-the-job injuries and be put in hospital. Players will also gain ranks throughout the game, starting off as Firefighters and being promoted up to Fire Chief.<br/><br/>When fire calls are completed by players, the corresponding district is covered and occupied. Immediately after all 11 districts are occupied, the game ends and the player with the most wins.<br/><br/>",

You can upgrade your mechs with weapons and accessories and then battle for supremacy in a fast-paced board game using buildings and scenery built from your favourite plastic toy building bricks.<br/><br/>The first game in the Mechabrick product line is Gangs of Neon City. Set in the back-streets of a futuristic far-eastern metropolis the game uses durable plastic gaming boards (supplied in the game box) printed with a brick-standard grid pattern (4-bricks square) upon which movement and shooting range of the robots is measured.<br/><br/>It's up to you and your imagination to build, change and rebuild the buildings and scenery on your game board from plastic toy building bricks and create your perfect battle environment.<br/><br/>The game sets two or more players in a head-to-head battle of turn-based play using 'action points' to choose whether each robot should move, shoot or both in each turn. Customisation and upgrades to your robots are key to a decisive win, but be careful not to weigh down your mech with too many upgrades and make them too slow to fight!<br/><br/>The printed rulebook supplied with the boxed game is only 4 pages long and is designed to be fun and fast-paced for all the family. We will be publishing free add-ons and expanded rules for the game to keep even the most hardened gamers interested for many years to come.<br/><br/>The boxed game includes four of the 'Wakazashi-Class' mech kits (two black and two white), four plastic game boards, a decal sheet to customize your mechs and your scenery, two D6 dice and a full rule/instruction booklet.<br/><br/>",

You have been commissioned to create a section of the Appalachian Trail, something that will eventually extend 2,200 miles through 14 states! It is your job to forge the best trail possible, with varying terrains to cross, scenic views, and majestic native wildlife. Unfortunately, others have also been commissioned to create sections of the trail and might try to stop you!<br/><br/>In Appalachian Trail each player is given a section of the trail to complete. This is accomplished by matching up similar terrain cards to each other. However, your opponents might put an obstacle in your path, forcing you to change the direction of your trail.<br/><br/>There are also trail improvements that increase the value of your section of the Appalachian Trail so that it attracts more hikers.<br/><br/>Completing your trail first is important but winning is based on victory points which are accumulated through: trail completion, longest trail, set collection, and more.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When mankind first discovered warp points, the gravitational anomalies that allowed him to travel to the stars, humanity spread like wildfire. A mighty Empire of Man grew in all directions. Colonies were planted on any planet that could support them. New spacefaring races were encountered, trade established, wars fought. Until finally the Empire of Man grew too large; internal dissention and external jealousy conspired to destroy it. First the far-flung Empire became too difficult to control centrally.  Outer systems demanded more sovereignty, leading to rebellion and civil war. And once that war was lost, neighboring races pounced, snatching what they could. The collapse culminated in the bombardment of Terra and the subjugation of most of the remaining colonies.<br/><br/>Now, years later, humans on Old Terra have finally recovered. Humanity has spread all over known space, but humans on Mother Terra are ready to reach again for the stars. Ready to reclaim their Shattered Empire<br/><br/>Shattered Empire is a Print and Play (PnP) solo game in which the player takes on the struggles of the people of Earth to rebuild and defend their new star empire. The map depicts the systems around Old Terra and, beyond that, the regions controlled by other governments and races. Each turn represents about a decade of time and each ship counter is an individual starship. Players try to expand and defend their empire and score victory points over a 150 year period of time (less if your empire completely succumbs to its foes).<br/><br/>",

In Dogfight players strive to collect then play sets of cards in order to shoot down their opponents. The game is over when only one side remains, or when the victory conditions of the scenario being played are met.<br/><br/>The game features set collection, card drafting, and variable player powers.<br/><br/>Dogfight contains 54 cards used to form the draw deck during the game. Each card is from one of six Attack Sets, as noted by the title across the top of the card: Crossing Shot, Diving Shot, Head On Shot, Strafing Run, Trailing Shot, and Turning Shot.<br/><br/>Attack Sets may have special conditions governing when the set can be played. Before trying to damage an enemy plane, you must collect a number of cards from the same Attack Set equal to the card&rsquo;s Set Size. These cards are then played together as a Bid for Damage. If the attack is successful, then the target plane suffers damage equal to the Damage Value listed on the cards.<br/><br/>Some cards in the deck have a Defensive Value and can be used to avoid an enemy attack.<br/><br/>The draw deck is also used for randomly assigning specific types of damage to target planes. For each point of damage inflicted, one card is flipped over from the draw deck and the listed damage is applied. The information along the bottom of the card is used solely for this purpose, and is ignored during the set collection portions of the game.<br/><br/>",

The first player takes a card from the Brainbox and turns the timer over. The player then has ten seconds to study the picture on the card. When the timer runs out the card is passed to player two and player one rolls the die to see which question is to be asked. The questions are on the reverse of the picture card. Player Two checks the answer by looking at the picture and if it is correct the card is given back to Player One to keep. If the answer is wrong the card is placed back into the Brainbox and the next player chooses a card. Please remember, the answer to the question is on the picture side of the card, so look carefully! The player with the most cards after ten minutes wins! If there is a tie, it's sudden death with both players choosing a card and having to answer all eight questions on the card. The player who answers the most correctly wins! For 1 player Look at the card as above for ten seconds. Then turn the card over and answer all the questions (use a pen and paper to record the answers). If all questions are answered correctly the card is kept. If any answers are incorrect, the card has to be put back in the Brainbox. See how many cards you have after five or ten minutes.<br/><br/>",

Movement is based on drawing cards of two types: Oil Moving Cards and Pumping Station Cards. Oil Moving Cards are used to follow a longer, circuitous route, while the Pumping Station Cards use the Trans-Alaska Pipeline system that runs straight down the board for potential shortcuts. Oil Movement Cards can be drawn on any space of the board, while Pumping Station Cards may only be drawn on Pumping Station spaces.<br/><br/>The 52 Oil Movement Cards contain 35 movement cards with values ranging from +1 to +10, 11 themed Go Back cards with values from -2 to -9, 3 themed No Move cards, 1 Go Back to Start card and 1 Advance token to Port Valdez card.<br/><br/>There are 52 Pumping Station Cards, each displaying a pumping station numbered 1-12.  Pumping Station 1 is in Prudhoe Bay while Pumping Station 12 is in Port Valdez. When drawn, the player's barrel moves to that pumping station, even if that sends the barrel in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>The first player to move all 4 barrels to their tanker is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game, players are farmers making a living in infamous Pasture 51, where talk of extraterrestrial activity runs high, and cattle are often rumored to disappear.  Farmers are full of it, and are always trying to top each others' stories of what they have seen; some of it credible, and some of it less so.  You will attempt to weave the most credible UFO story!<br/><br/>Mechanically, Pasture 51 is a stock (get it?) holding game, where players will decide which cattle they wish to hold while also deciding which cattle are legitimately abducted (adding to the credibility of the stories), which cattle simply pass away in the fields, and which cattle are involved in abduction hoaxes (which hurts the credibility of the stories).  There is one pasture card on the table for each of these outcomes, where cattle will graze before meeting their fate.<br/><br/>On a player's turn, he will draw two livestock tokens from a bag, with livestock coming in four varieties.  He will choose one to keep in his personal stock, and one to put below a pasture card of his choice.<br/><br/>The backs of these tokens all contain special abilities as well.  When a token is put out into pasture, it is flipped into the air.  If it lands cattle-side up, too bad, no special ability.  If it lands ability-side up, the player will get to perform an ability such as moving a cattle to an adjacent pasture, swapping a cattle from his personal stock with one in the pastures, or witnessing an abduction, which moves a cattle token from grazing in the pasture up onto the pasture card, where it is locked for the rest of the game.  Abducting cattle while they are in the right pastures will be key to your success!<br/><br/>After a set number of turns, players will determine the value of each cattle variety.  Cattle involved in hoaxes will decrease that variety's value, while those that were abducted by the real deal will add to it.  Players then compare their personal holdings against the value of each cattle variety, with most points weaving the most credible tale!<br/><br/>",

Turns are alternate. The goal is to capture an opponent's cards using one of yours of lower rank, until you have the highest ranked card remaining.<br/><br/>Captures are only valid if they take place in the same row or column as the card you want to use, the card-to-be-captured also must be of higher rank. For example, 2black can capture 5red, but 5red cannot capture 2black (or anything below a 6). A capture is performed by placing your card on your opponent's, and removing the captured card from the field.<br/><br/>When no legal moves are possible, the person with the highest ranked card remaining wins the round, and earns the point value of the card. Kings are 13 points, Queens 12, Jacks 11. For example, if 8black and 5red remain, black wins and gets 8 points. If the round ends in a tie, then the person who made the last move wins. The game continues until someone gets 30 points.<br/><br/>",

Aces have a value of one.<br/><br/>SET UP: shuffle the cards then lay them face up in a circle or square to form the track. Then one player decides to be Odd, the other Even. Both take three tokens. Odd places one token on the odd numbered cards of the same number, either all the aces, threes or fives. Even does the same, just on even numbered cards (twos, fours, or sixes).<br/><br/>MOVEMENT: The number value of a card determines how far a token is moved. Who moves which token doesn't matter, only that the Odd player moves an odd number of spaces, and Even an even number, both moving in a clockwise manner. Occupied cards in the path of your token are hopped over and not counted when moving, only one token can occupy a card at any time.<br/><br/>SCORING: at the end of your turn, count how many spaces you moved in total, including occupied cards you skipped over. An odd number scores points for Odd, an even number for Even, regardless of who moved the token. For example, if Odd moves a token on a 5 card, but is forced to hop over an occupied space in the way, this equals six spaces moved, so Even receives six points, though it was not his or her turn. The round ends when someone has gained 30 points, the winner receiving the difference between the winning and losing scores. For example, if Odd has 30 and Even 28, Odd gets 2 points for that round.<br/><br/>GOAL: to gain 30 points after a series of rounds. The loser of a previous round starts the next one. Tokens are not rearranged between rounds, and both players start the round with zero points.<br/><br/>",

Two players, black and white, have pieces in three types: four captains, three commodores, and one admiral.  To start the game, the board is positioned with the extreme corners of the board closest to each player.  The admiral piece begins on the hex closest to each player.  The next two hexes closer to the middle of the board remain empty.  On the following three closer hexes are stationed the three commodores, and on the next four hexes the captains.<br/><br/>Pieces are not captured at any point in the game. Admirals may be moved one space at a time to any adjacent hexagon. Commodores are color-bound and may move two spaces to a hex of the same color.  The intermediate space need not be unoccupied, only the hex on which the commodore will land.  Captains are moved any number of spaces in a straight line from the joining sides of their hex, but may not pass over another piece.  To win the game, an opponent&rsquo;s admiral must be blockaded from being able to move in any direction.  Movement may be prevented by either player&rsquo;s pieces, and once an admiral is blockaded, none of that player&rsquo;s other pieces are allowed to move.<br/><br/>",

Players are each dealt a suspect card. There are 4 suspects per case, one or more who may be guilty. One player reads aloud the case summary. Then, all players silently read their suspect&rsquo;s alibi. If the math in their suspect&rsquo;s alibi is correct, then he is innocent. Incorrect math indicates guilt. Players decide if their suspect is innocent or guilty and later take turns vocalizing their verdict and mathematical reasoning. Points are awarded based on correct determination of a suspect&rsquo;s innocence or guilt and also for describing why the guilty party&rsquo;s alibi did not jive (i.e., why the math was incorrect). The winner is the player with the most points after a pre-determined number of rounds or time limit set at the beginning of game play. You&rsquo;ll need to draw on a variety of math skills to solve these whodunit mysteries as each game includes 50 different cases.<br/><br/>",

After the player sitting on the dealer's left gets the first three cards, the dealing is stopped and this player, having looked at his cards, calls the trump suit.<br/><br/>As usual the highest trump, or if none are played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick.  The winner of each trick leads to the next.<br/><br/>Winning the game and the match<br/>At the end of the game each partnership counts the tricks they have taken. The game is won by the party which takes more tricks. To win the match, a partnership must win two games, without losing any games in between them, the number of tricks taken in the second game they win being more than in the first game they win.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Introduction<br/><br/>Spar is a popular game from Ghana. It is a trick-taking game without trumps, in which the object is to win the last trick.<br/><br/>Spar is usually played by 2, 3 or 4 players, but it is possible for up to 7 to play. The game uses 35 cards from a standard international 52-card pack, the cards of each suit ranking from high to low: A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, but the Ace of Spades is normally not used, so the highest card in that suit is the King.<br/><br/>Play<br/><br/>Whoever played the highest card of the suit that the first player led is the winner of the trick. The cards played are not gathered in but remain in a face up pile. The winner of the trick leads any card from hand to begin the next trick, playing it face up on top of the pile, and once again the other players must each play a card: this must be the same suit as the card that was led if possible, otherwise any card.<br/><br/>This continues until five tricks have been played.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/><br/>Whoever wins the fifth and last trick wins the hand and scores:<br/><br/>3 points if the winning card is a 6;<br/>    2 points if the winning card is a 7;<br/>    1 point for winning with any other card - 8 or higher.<br/><br/>The winner of the hand deals the next hand, and therefore plays last to the first trick of the next hand. The session continues for as long as the players wish - there is no fixed number of deals or target score that ends the session.<br/><br/>Variations<br/><br/>Two other versions of this game exists: Jeu de Carte, which is played in Benin, and Sipa, a game played in Togo. Both share similar rules however.<br/><br/>Jeu de Carte<br/><br/>It is played with 31 cards (all the cards from Ace down to Seven except the Ace of Spades).<br/><br/>Players play their cards in front of them, rather than in a single pile in the centre. A player who is unable to follow suit to a trick plays his card face down.<br/><br/>The score is 1 point for winning the last trick, or 2 if it is won with a Seven.<br/><br/>The game is played until an agreed number of points is gained, often 24.<br/>  <br/>Sipa<br/><br/>The rules are identical to Jeu de Carte with the exception of Scoring:<br/>Whoever wins the fifth and last trick wins the hand and scores:<br/><br/>6 points if the winning player wins the last three tricks with 7&rsquo;s<br/>    4 points if the winning player wins the last two tricks with 7&rsquo;s<br/>    2 points if the winning card is a 7;<br/>    1 point for winning the last trick with any other card - 8 or higher.<br/><br/>The winner is the player who is the first to score 10 or more points - or the players may agree on some other target score, such as 6, 12 or 24 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This Swedish game, best for about 4 to 6 players, is played with Swedish Kille cards. These come as a 42 card deck, without suits, but with two of each of the 21 ranks, which from high to low are Harlekin (joker), Kuku (cuckoo), Husar (hussar), Husu (pig), Kavall (horse), V&auml;rdshus (inn), 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1. Kransen (wreath), Blompottan (flowerpot), Blaren (face).<br/><br/>Each player is dealt 5 cards and tricks are played. Any card can be led, and subsequent players must either equal or beat the highest card so far played to the trick or play the lowest card in their hand. The object is to have the lowest card after four tricks have been played.<br/><br/>Players score points based on their final card following a guessing round where one can 'declare' he has the lowest card, or 'pass'<br/><br/>A score sheet is maintained showing the cumulative score of each player. A player reaching a score of 50 or over is out. The last remaining is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each poker hand is assigned a point value (p), as follows:<br/><br/>1p &mdash; One Pair: Two cards of the same rank (e.g.: A, 10, 10, 6, 2).<br/>2p &mdash; Two Pair: Two pairs of different ranks (e.g.: K, K, J, 4, 4).<br/>3p &mdash; Three of a Kind: Three cards of the same rank (e.g.: Q, Q, Q, 9, 6).<br/>4p &mdash; Straight: Five cards in rank sequence (e.g.: J, 10, 9, 8, 7).<br/>5p &mdash; Flush: Five cards of the same suit (e.g.: A, J, 10, 7, 3; all diamonds).<br/>6p &mdash; Full House: Three of a kind in one rank and a pair in a different rank (e.g.: Q, Q, Q, 9, 9). <br/>7p &mdash; Four of a Kind: Four cards of the same rank (e.g.: J, J, J, J, 8).<br/>9p &mdash; Straight Flush: A straight with all cards of the same suit (e.g.: J, 10, 9, 8, 7; all diamonds).<br/><br/>Points are also awarded for taking the last trick of each round (5 points), or for scoring a &quot;Chicago&quot; by taking all five tricks of the round (15 or 25 points, must be declared by calling &quot;Chicago&quot; before any trick is played).<br/><br/>The first player to reach a pre-determined number of points (typically 50, 52, or 100) wins the game.<br/><br/>Common scoring variants include awarding an automatic &quot;Chicago&quot; for a holder of a straight flush instead of the normal points awarded for that hand at the end of the round. Others award points equal to the game goal (50, 52, or 100) if the straight flush is also &quot;Royal&quot; (meaning, ranks A, K, Q, J, 10).<br/><br/>Playing a round<br/><br/>Each player (including the dealer) is dealt 5 cards after which 3 phases follow. Before each phase, the players are allowed to discard any unwanted cards face down to the central playing area and are dealt an equal number of replacement cards.<br/><br/>First and Second Phase<br/><br/>Each player may now declare any poker hand which they hold (honor system). Highest hand scores points according to the value of the poker hand combination. The other players do not score. In the case of a tie, highest card used to score the hand wins (highest triple in the event of a full house). If still tied, highest non-scoring card breaks the tie. If still tied, each tied player scores full points.<br/><br/>Variant: If you scored a poker hand, but discard at least one of the scoring cards before the next phase, you must simply announce that you are &quot;not keeping&quot; your hand.<br/><br/>Third Phase<br/><br/>The player to the left of the dealer leads out by playing a card in front of themselves. Each other player must follow suit, if able. The winner of the trick leads out the following trick, and so on.<br/><br/>It is important for all players to keep their own cards separated from other player cards. All played cards should be clearly visible to all players.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the first trick, and only during the first trick, before a player has played their card, they may call &quot;Chicago&quot;. Should this happen, all players gather any cards they played back into their hand (as applicable) and the player who called &quot;Chicago&quot; will lead out instead. In order to score a successful &quot;Chicago&quot;, all five tricks must be won, no exceptions.<br/><br/>Round Scoring<br/><br/>The winner of the fifth and last trick scores 5 points (variant: score 10 points if you won the trick with a 2). As was done during the first two phases, the best poker hand also scores. If a successful &quot;Chicago&quot; was played, no other points are scored. A failed &quot;Chicago&quot; instead results in the caller receiving a score penalty equal to the points normally awarded (-15 or -25 points). A cumulative negative score is possible.<br/><br/>At the end of scoring, if any player has reached the pre-determined final score, the game ends. Otherwise, or in the event of a tie, play continues. Deal passes to the left. The entire deck is re-shuffled before the initial deal each round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Thirst for Power from Nexus Games is a strategy and resource management game in which players are governors of regions and compete to be the first to provide for their citizens' energy needs.<br/><br/>The objective is to be the first player to meet the region's energy goal without exceeding its environmental impact limit. In the game, you will find that energy production, water consumption, and climate change are tightly intertwined. We call this the Nexus of Energy, Water, and Climate. This nexus makes it hard to get what you want and requires making trade-offs to win.<br/><br/>As governor, you will accumulate energy sources to provide for the transportation and electricity needs of your citizens. You will have a wide range of energy sources to choose from, both hydrocarbon-based and renewable. But, watch out! Every kind of energy source requires water and has an environmental impact on climate, land, water or living things. You will have limited water resources and a cap on your environmental impact, making it challenging to reach your energy goal. Energy sources like coal and oil will produce a lot of energy, but also use up a lot of water and have a big environmental impact. Renewable sources use less water and have lower environmental impact, but generate much less energy.<br/><br/>ACTION cards (TECHNOLOGY, POLICY, AND CLIMATE IMPACT) bring in real-world developments that change the course of the game and force players to quickly adapt their strategy. Buying technology gives you an advantage, while implementing policies can set your opponent back, and climate impacts wreak havoc on everyone. Strategy is critical along with negotiating trades throughout the game. Getting the right mix of energy sources and technology boosts for your region can be easier with negotiations and trades than taking your chances drawing from the deck.<br/><br/>",

If there is a tie for lowest score then wait until the next train has left the Station - basically as soon as there is a clear lowest score that player is given the tile. They may use it at any time in the game to send any train out of the station early (as in immediately the whistle blows). However, if the tile hasn't been used and another player becomes the lowest scorer then they take the tile.<br/>The tile may only be used once during the entire game (that is ONCE not once per player) - put it back in the box when it has<br/>been used.<br/><br/>Tile #2: The Guard's Flag:<br/>This tile may also only be used once per game. It begins on the table next to the train stack. On their turn any player may decide to use the Flag instead of taking their normal turn (ie they do not get to play a carriage or place a passenger chit). The Flag is placed above a train which shows that the train has a fault and cannot be moved. Remove all the passenger chits and return them to their owners, then discard the carriages and the train engine - no one scores this train. After use place the Flag back in the box<br/><br/>",

Aditionally, you gain +1 audacity tokens for moving onto this space (only once per game) and are safe from the boss monster.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     The Additional Portal Room Card: If a 5 is rolled when using the portal space you move to the next closest portal space (On your next turn you may attempt to move to the final portal). If a 6 is rolled you may move to the furthest portal space. If you fail the roll on one portal you may still use the next portal. <br/>        Optional House Rule: You may choose either portal if you roll a 5 or a 6.<br/>    <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules:<br/><br/>Alphabid is the game of crosswords. Using identical sets of color-coded letters, two players match vocabularies by drawing, bidding and playing, crossword style, as many letters per word as possible. As the grid fills up, the players may begin to risk their turns in an effort to make longer words than the opponent. The final outcome remains undetermined until a player has drawn the last letter and the opponent cannot catch up.<br/><br/>Description:<br/><br/>Alphabid is played on an 18x18 square grid. As indicated by the description in the rules, each player has an identical set of tiles. However, each starts off with a random selection of eight of these. After the first turn, a player must start their turn by &quot;bidding&quot; the number of tiles they think they can play; this entitles them to draw that many tiles, after which they can raise their bid in order to draw more tiles. After they have bid as high as they want (or they have eight tiles, which is the maximum) they must play at least as many letters as they bid. If a player plays eight tiles on a turn they draw eight more without having to bid.<br/><br/>Play follows standard Scrabble rules: words are played left-to-right or top-to-bottom and all orthogonally adjacent letters must form words.<br/><br/>Plays do not score points. Instead, the object is to draw all of one's tiles. If both players manage to do this on the same turn, the player who has the fewest tiles left wins.<br/><br/>",

The sentence itself often gives an innocuous clue to the blank. Players then compare answers and score points for matching answers.<br/><br/>One player acts as quizmaster and the other players take turns to be a &quot;contestant&quot; and a &quot;panelist.&quot; The quizmaster decides who the first contestant is going to be the first question is read out and the contestant and panelists write their answers on the sheet provided.<br/><br/>When everyone has recorded their answer, the contestant reads out his answer first, followed by each panelist in turn. Each time that the answer of the contestant matches that of the panelist the contestant gets a point.<br/><br/>The two contestants with the highest number of points then go on to play the &quot;Super Match Game.&quot; In this game there are three possible answers to each question--the answers are worth 50 points, 100 points or 150 points. When a player matches any of these answers, they record the number of points won. The player with the most points at the end of the Super Match is the winner and goes on to the Head to Head game, the last round.<br/><br/>In The Price Is Right, one player acts as host to set up the puzzles and verify correct answers. The other players make bids on prizes. The player who bids closest without going over plays a pricing game against the house for more prizes. (The television series rotates over seventy different games. Some home game editions contains as many as forty-five games; some as few as six.)<br/><br/>The finale is called the Showcase Round. The two players involved may be the players with the highest scores or it may be the players who won their respective Showcase Showdowns. (It depends on the edition of the game.) Each player has three prizes. Each guesses what the total value of one's own three prizes is. The person who guesses closer without going over is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Each round, the starting player chooses 4 of 8 monster hunters that will hunt down monsters played each trick; these 4 cards are shuffled into a face down pile. Each trick, players play one card each of any colour and number, and then the top monster hunter card is revealed, and any cards that matches the conditions of the monster hunter are discarded. Of the remaining monsters, the lowest number of each colour are score, the rest discarded. Players can also discard cards from their hand to gain their special effects.<br/><br/>After three tricks, the monster hunter cards are re-gathered, re-chosen and the players play three rounds like this; the most points in their score pile wins.<br/><br/>",
