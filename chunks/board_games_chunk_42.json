        "description": "LineUp! is played on a 5x5 grid of squares, with circles at each corner of these squares forming a 6x6 grid. On each player&rsquo;s turn they are permitted to place a token on any of these squares or corners. Players start with 25 tokens each and the game is over when both players have used all of their tokens.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to attempt to build secured structures by either placing or capturing tokens on the board. There are two types of secured structures:<br/><br/>     Having tokens on a square and the 4 corners surrounding it<br/>     Having tokens on a corner and the 4 squares surrounding it<br/><br/><br/>Tokens making up a secured structure cannot be captured.<br/><br/>Instead of placing a token on an unoccupied area of the board, a player may remove one of their opponent&rsquo;s tokens and replace it with their own. This is called capturing a token. Captured<br/>tokens are removed from the game. A token may only be captured if you have a line of tokens adjacent to the token you wish to capture that is greater in length than the line of your<br/>opponent&rsquo;s adjacent tokens in the opposite direction. Thus, to capture a square you must have a line of squares and to capture a corner you must have a line of corners. Tokens that make up<br/>part of a secured structure cannot be captured, but can be used in forming lines to capture other tokens.<br/><br/>The game ends when both players have run out of tokens to place on the board. When this happens, count the number of secured structures each player has built during the game. Remember, tokens can be used in more than one secured structure. The player with the highest number of secured structures wins.<br/><br/>If the number of secured structures is equal, then the player with the largest number of tokens on the board wins on possession (this is the same as the player who has captured the most tokens). If this number is equal then the game is a draw.<br/><br/>(Excerpts from the instructions)<br/><br/>",

Each player builds an unique deck of 60-80 cards (out of 8 different types of cards). During the game the empires rise and each player desides, when he wants to fall to get victory points. The the player builds up a new Empire with a different starting planet. To conquer a planet, the player have to build an outpost and get influence on this planet (depends on the number of possible ouposts on this planet). Each time he get influence, surrounding planets with other players outposts will also get influence-tokens. <br/>Each planet needs one out of four ressources to get victory points . To get the right ressources to the matching planet a player has to trade with the Galactic Senat, other players or move ressources through the trading routes. At the end of the turn each player bids on a special Senat-action for the next turn.<br/>If a player counquers a planet, he'll get a special action each turn, but can't play as many cards as before. So each planet makes the players game more static and predictable.<br/><br/>Depending on the deck a player chooses, each player tries to get victory points through conquering, producing, attacking or trading or a mix of these types.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Toussaint L&rsquo;Ouverture and the slave insurrections in Saint-Domingue (now Haiti), the richest trading colony in the new world,  shocked and terrified Western Nations. Not since Spartacus had slave rebellions succeeded on such a grand scale. However, this story cannot be confined to a single leader like Toussaint. It is far more complicated, riddled with intrigue and rife with defections. There is no shortage of villains, and heroes are often conflicted. On the surface, the topic is obscure but the ramifications for this conflict were incredibly far-reaching.<br/><br/>Black Eagles is a card assisted, multi-player, area movement cube game that covers the period 1792-1804. Black Eagles is broken into four distinct scenarios: the &quot;Rights of Man,&quot; or the introduction of republican ideals to the island; &quot;Imperial Designs,&quot; or the invasion of English and Spanish forces; &quot;Civil War,&quot; internal conflict between the Mulattos and the rebel leaders; and finally &quot;Leclerc Invades,&quot; featuring Napoleon's attempt to restore slavery to the island.<br/><br/>Black Eagles allows one (yes, there is a solitaire version) to four players to command one of five historical rebel leaders, Toussaint L'Ouverture included, as well as Napoleon's veteran general Charles Victoire Emmanuel Leclerc. Those not commanded by players become factions available for alliance, along with the Gros Blancs, the Petits Blancs, the Spanish, the French, and the English, each provides the controlling player with a special ability. Alliances are fluid, as is the allegiance of the very units under your command. The more of the island's economy a player controls the more havoc he can cause with the funds he collects. On the other hand, the player who carries the least influence automatically controls the Petits Blancs and no matter how weak a player is, he can always attack a stronger player's economic base.<br/><br/>Black Eagles is no longer in its infancy. Play testing has proven it to be well worthwhile. Scenario play ranges from 90 minutes to four hours. Components include a 22&quot; by 34&quot; map, 45 card events that affect play in various turn phases  --cards also provide resolution for the devastating Yellow Fever. THe game will include Player aids, hundreds of 6mm colored cubes (factional combat units), and several sheets of miscellaneous markers.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "(from the company website)<br/><br/>Guam is a large island for a Pacific island battle. However, it has the fewest exclusive rules of the three games currently in the series (Saipan &amp; Tinian and Attu &amp; Kiska). This means that it should be the easiest and quickest to learn. The large size of the island allows both players to employ a wide variety of strategy options. As with most of the other games in the series, the victory conditions do not focus on geographic locations. The situation is simply a fight between both sides.<br/><br/>Planning is the first step, and quite possibly the most important one too. The US player has to examine the Japanese dispositions, by looking over the map and using the limited intelligence rules to try to figure out where the Japanese main defenses are. Next in the planning cycle is to pick landing locations and then select the composition and order of your beachheads and landing forces. Once the US player lands on the island he has to eliminate the Japanese units. That is a pretty simple goal, but it may not be as easy as it sounds! You have to do it within the game&rsquo;s time limit. He will have to find that perfect balance between time, maneuver, and combat. Too slow, cautious, or methodical and you run out of time. Too impatient and aggressive and you will suffer too many casualty points to win.<br/><br/>In Guam the Japanese player has many options; the most of all the games in the series. You still have many of the same conditions as the other games, such as fortifications, being outnumbered, defending against an overwhelming invasion, and your opponent has air and naval superiority. However, you have a large enough force on a large enough island to allow far more opportunity for maneuvering. The Japanese player also has a variety of terrain types to incorporate into his defense. The clever use of dummy positions can fool the US player, making him attack unmanned positions or chasing scattered dummy units all over the map. But as in all the games, the Japanese player must have a well thought out plan with several courses of action in mind. Fortifications and dummies must be well placed in anticipation of US player moves.<br/><br/>The Series<br/><br/>Game scale:<br/><br/>Unit size: Platoon, Company, and Battalion.<br/><br/>Scale: Hex scale: 1/2 mile.<br/><br/>Game Turn: Each turn represents 12 hours.<br/><br/>The Pacific Island Series game system is a simulation of ground combat in the Pacific during World War II. Each game in the system represents a battle between Allied and Imperial Japanese forces on one of the many Pacific Islands. The series includes Saipan/Tinian -Vol. I,  Guam - Vol. II and Attu &amp; Kiska - Vol. III.<br/><br/>Two sets of rules are provided with each game. The first contains the Standard Rules that are common to all the games in the Pacific Island Series. The second set contains the Exclusive Rules for each game in the system, which includes Special rules, the Initial Deployment and the Reinforcement Schedule. Generally the unit scale is battalion, but there are company and platoon formations represented. The time scale, unless noted in the Exclusive rules, is 1/2 day per turn.<br/><br/>The focus of the series is on the land battles of the Pacific, therefore all naval and air forces are abstract. The games are designed for two players, but can accommodate multiple players. For example, one player can play the US Marines, one can play the US Army, and the third plays the Japanese.<br/><br/>This series of games is loosely based on or inspired by several different game systems, including SPI's Island War series and GRD/GDW's Europa series, but many concepts are quite original. The tactical situation for the defender can be described as &quot;against the odds&quot;, which means it will be very difficult for the player playing the defender to win the game tactically. The victory conditions are designed in such a way that the defender can win by performing better than his historical counterpart. This also puts a lot of pressure on the attacker because he cannot afford to make many mistakes.<br/><br/>Game features include:<br/><br/>1. Limited intelligence.<br/>2. Amphibious Landings<br/>3. Weather and Night rules<br/>4. Banzai attacks<br/>5. Coastal Defense units<br/>6. Beachheads and Replacements<br/>7. Fortifications<br/><br/>",

With 5 players, each player gets 4 Query Cards.<br/><br/>The Puzzle Master then chooses a Puzzle Card and reads the puzzle to the group (and reads the answer to themselves only).<br/><br/>From left-to-right players turn in a Query Card to ask a yes-or-no question.

If they receive any other answer, play moves to their left.<br/><br/>Players need to pay close attention to the questions being asked so they don't duplicate questions.<br/><br/>Whoever answers the puzzle correctly keeps the Puzzle Card.  If no one is able to determine the answer before all the Query Cards are played, the Puzzle Master keeps the Puzzle Card and the role of Puzzle Master rotates to their left and the Query Cards are dealt again.

Getting there was bad enough with all the hardships of freezing cold conditions, massive storms, and seas that could swallow up a ship leaving little trace. If forced to abandon ship in such waters they were under no illusions that they chances of survival were slim. There were some remarkable stories of survival but the privations endured by those who made it back alive were just as remarkable in that there were so few who lived to tell the tale of being sunk on the Murmansk run.<br/><br/>Of course, although the port facilities available were Spartan and poorly equipped to handle the huge amount of stores delivered, then there was the problem of getting such cargoes there in the first place.<br/><br/>Having arrived, there were almost no amenities for the crews of ships to use in order to rest up after fighting there way to Murmansk. Indeed the Soviets were reluctant to give the crews much freedom to go ashore at all. Food was scarce. That supplied was grudgingly given, boring and lacking nutrition. So for those who had arrived, the long wait until they could join a convoy back to the UK was like a prison sentence. Perhaps the only thing the Russians seemed to have plenty of was Vodka and with that they could be extremely generous.<br/><br/>Join the thriving community around this intensely popular war game.<br/><br/>Game sclae is of 20cm or 8 inches per nautical mile, so  1cm equals 1 knot. If a ship is moving 14 knots, will plot a 14 cm movement in the game, for example. Players are encouraged to play with any sclae, although the desinger suggest 1:3000 as the best one.<br/>Players take the role of and allied convoy from or towards Murmansk or Anchangelsk during the IIWW and try to protect the ships from the German player, who will try to shunk them with either vessels, submarines or the Luftwaffe.<br/>Game comes with a comprehensive way to generate merchants convoys and its adecuate escort of warships, meanwhile the German player will have his own forces. All this will change according to the year and nationality played, so for 1942 the forces will be different from those of 1945 and also those avaliable to the Royal Navy or the Soviets.<br/>The game has also an event generator to add some flavor, and full tables to calculate combat and the damage and critical hits taken by the diverse forces.<br/><br/>(From the web publisher Nimble Books LLC)<br/><br/>",

This set of rules uses no game board, instead units are moved by measurements in inches, and rulers are used also for firing weapons. I use different colors of felt to denote hills, forest, water, and roads. Units may be hidden and put on opportunity fire, or be activated to move and fire. There are rules for artillery and infantry as well. Infantry may be used as artillery spotters, or to attack other infantry or armor. There is also Infantry support which includes heavier weapons such as bazookas.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "J: The Misere Connection Game is in the family of connection games that include Hex and Gonnect. It is unique in that players can win if they force their opponent to form a connection between two areas on the board, and takes place on an 8x4 board.<br/><br/>The origins of this game date back to a failed attempt to come up with a connection game for Stonehenge, which had an outer track that is very long but very tight.  The shift to a set 8x4 board caused the game to be viewed differently than on the circular board of Stonehenge.<br/><br/>Another unique aspect to J is that players can LOSE the game if they form a certain type of connection, which would be a misere condition in a connection game.  This is also a a unique feature.  I had been pondering how to do one and J provides the opportunity to do this.<br/><br/>The game also features several other uncommon features, besides the small board and misere game ending condition, like piece recycling, and also entire lines of pieces being pushed.<br/><br/>",

Fatigue, morale, supply and command are as important as fighting prowess and sheer numbers.  Units not just take physical losses but will become ineffective from fatigue and disorder long before they run out of men - unless you, in command, can manage them effectively and maintain their edge over two days of fighting.  Corps are normally activated by chitpulls, but for PBEM play a less interactive version is provided that still provides a significant advantage to the side that grabs the initiative in the battle.<br/><br/>Map scale: 1km per hex<br/>Unit scale: divisions, 1000 men per strength point<br/>Time scale: 3.5 hours per daylight turn, 8 hours per night turn<br/><br/>",

The game begins with playing one of the dominoes from your hand and creating a scene based on the pips and their matching values for that character.  After the scene, the remaining people at the table can embellish the scene and vote to determine if the player earned the points on the domino and can add it to their score.  Play continues around the table until all the dominoes in hand are used.  At that time, the hidden agendas are revealed and any bonus points are awarded.  High score wins and gets to describe the fate of the players and  any NPCs that were created.<br/><br/>Theme: TTwR started out as a Game Chef 2011 entry and was expanded and polished after the contest.  The theme for GC'11 was Shakespeare and TTwR is designed to create character driven stories that tend to take tragic and comedic turns.  Game play is wide open, but the rules provide the structure for story telling among strangers and play testing/con games have shown that the system delivers on the fun.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 2-player, strategy, board-game is staged during the entire 5 years of the American Civil War and is focused on what was termed the Eastern Theatre, principally Virginia and neighbouring States. The board is composed of 24x32 squares (18mm) (on a folded A2-sized map) and portrays the geography and transport system of the time. One player assumes the role of Confederate President Jeff Davis and deploys the gray armies (represented by numbered gray cardboard squares) to defend the new Confederate nation. The other player assumes the role of Union President Abraham Lincoln, and deploys the blue armies (represented by numbered blue cardboard squares) in an attempt to crush the rebellion and recapture Confederate territory and cities.<br/><br/>Players take turns to &ldquo;move and fight&rdquo; as they manoeuvre their armies around the map. The game begins in the year 1861 and has the potential to continue until the end of 1865. Each year is made up of 4 Game Turns (except for 1861 which has only 3 Game Turns) with games typically taking 2-4 hours to complete. Victory points are awarded for winning battles, destroying armies, capturing towns and achieving specific objectives. The Victory Point Ladder shows who is winning at any stage of the game. A player wins the game by garnering sufficient victory points or achieving a winning objective such as occupying their opponent&rsquo;s capital.<br/><br/>The game fits into a slim, lightweight white plastic A4 box colourfully decorated. The box contains a folded map, blue and grey numbered army pieces, 3 game charts, a die, round town markers, a 20 page comprehensive rule booklet and a 3 page &quot;Let's get started&quot; rule booklet. Access is also provided to information regarding: strategy and tactics, the historical basis behind the rules and the map, the thinking behind the game's design and suggestions for optional rules to enable players to create more challenging game variants. For example,turning the army markers upside down creates a &quot;fog of war&quot; where although players can see their opponent&rsquo;s armies, their strengths are concealed. Historical and geographical accuracy has been attempted, however, no prior knowledge of the civil war is needed to play.<br/><br/>Specific features of the game include: ease of play, the game feels like an elaborate version of checkers / draughts played out over complex terrain. The blue Union armies can engage in sea-based movements to launch invasions. The game is sufficiently flexible as to allow experienced players to adjust the basic rules, eg to change movement allowances or army strengths to make games more challenging.<br/><br/>",

Humans, Borganoids, Ursans and Gryzz have lived in harmony for decades... until now. Following the invention of a brand new device called PUGS, tensions have grown.<br/><br/>PUGS, the Pocket Universe Generation System, is an amazing invention. When fired up, a brand new self-contained universe is created, filled with precious elements ready to be plundered  &ndash; as long as the players can find them. They'll need to race around the Pocket Universe and grab what they can as quickly as possible, avoiding attacks from the opposition<br/><br/>Players fly about the Pocket Universe made up of hexes, controlling their starship and attempting to explore planets and mine four different types of resources. Once collected they can either choose to return them to their starbase in order to score points or keep some aboard in order to use them to perform special abilities - some aggressive, some defensive.<br/><br/>Once a set amount of planets have been discovered, players must then make a final race to return their remaining resources to their base and score that last points boost. Whoever has the most points at the end will be declared the winner! Will you come out on top?<br/><br/>",

This battle is finely balanced and could go either way once the Union reserves arrive for the second day.<br/>The game comes with a printable game board that can be constructed 3 dimensionally for an impressive realistic feel. Counters, rules and all playing aids accompany the game including a set of tile dice for those of you without any cube dice.&quot; - <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.wargameshop.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.wargameshop.co.uk</a><br/>This game, as well as any other in the series, is an easy pleasure to play.  Combat units (brigades, batteries) show range, attack (to hit die roll), and strength.  Leaders show organization level and command area.  If subordinate units aren't close enough to the leader, there is only a chance they will be able to fire or move.  Victory is achieved by controlling certain hexes and disabling or dispersing the opponents' units. Low counter numbers (32 confederate, 49 union) don't overwhelm the nicely drawn map.  If someone wishes to make the effort, the maps can be created in 3D.<br/><br/>",

There are six thematic game boards with different pictures on each board. There are eighty tiles with pictures on each board. There are eighty tiles with pictures of familiar objects printed one each tile. The object of the game is to place these tiles face down on the game board, and use cues from the images on the board to the develop associations that assist you in recalling which object is on each tiles as you turn them over. You can start with just a few tiles and work up to recalling the objects on dozens of tiles.<br/><br/>RECALL can be played as a single-player activity, as a cooperative game, or as a competitive game. It can also be used as a great learning tool for kids.<br/><br/>You will be surprised how well your organizational techniques work. You will see improvement in your recall capability immediately!<br/><br/>For competitive play two or more players can play the game competitively. Each player takes a turn selecting, placing, and turning over Object Tiles. The number of correct Object Tiles is recorded and the player with the most correctly placed tiles wins.<br/><br/>To play cooperatively all players collectively decide on where to place Object Tiles.<br/><br/>",

The agents must not be seen or heard by the numerous guards walking around the location, so they must hide among the shadows, hide behind walls and furniture, and hit the enemies from behind, being silent the whole time.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each player chooses up to five items to help with the current mission. Each turn, the active player rolls the action dice and performs two of the rolled actions, which can be Move, Shoot, Melee Attack and Heal. In addition, one die can be replaced by a free action, which range from using an enemy as a meatshield, to interacting with locations, to hiding the corpse of a dead guard.<br/><br/>After a player performs his two actions, the guards &ndash; which come in three types: green, yellow and red &ndash; are activated. For each type of guard, one player rolls a die twice, with all the guards of this type then performing the rolled actions in order. Actions range from moving 1-4 areas, to shooting, to calling for help (which will spawn other guards). In more detail:<br/><br/><br/>    Green guards move, shoot, and spawn other guards at an average rate.<br/>    Yellow guards shoot and spawn other guards a lot.<br/>    Red guards shoot a lot and move very quickly.<br/><br/><br/>As soon as an alarm sounds due to a guard spotting a dead guard's corpse, all guards are activated with the red die, so things become much tougher for the player agents.<br/><br/>",

It is a &quot;friendly&quot; competitive game, in that players are competing for points, but don't attack each other directly.<br/><br/>Physical components include ships (either models or counters), a starbase, measuring sticks, and encounter blips.  Planets or other &quot;scenery&quot; add visual interest and block line of sight, but are not required to play.<br/><br/>Players start the game with equal number of points to purchase their fleet.  Turns proceed clockwise around the table.  Movement sticks are used to measure movement and weapon ranges.  Each ship has a unique ability, for example bombers get an extra die when attacking, scout ships may examine encounter blips, and freighters get bonuses to repair rolls.<br/><br/>Each ship in a fleet gets two actions per turn, which can include moving 1 stick, making a ranged attack, or collecting a commodity.  Most combat occurs between player ships and Pirate ships or other enemies that appear when an encounter blip is revealed.  Combat is a simple contested die roll, the number of dice based on the size and type of ship.  Player ships don't get destroyed, rather they become crippled and can repair, be repaired, or return to the starport to get repaired.<br/><br/>Unexplored space is represented by encounter blips, cards with different encounters placed face down and revealed when a ship comes in contact with them during its move.  Resolution of the encounter blip can earn that player Credits.  The game ends when all the blips have been resolved, and the player with the most credits wins!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rules of the game Fudbalinho<br/><br/>SETTING THE FORMATION<br/><br/>The game begins with the first agreement between the co attacks. Then the coach sets the defense of their players in the &quot;game zone&quot; but so that teammates must not touch.<br/> - When you see a defensive formation, the attack coach asks his players to &quot;play zone&quot; but they are not allowed to touch each other.<br/> - Grid - teammates are, setting the formation or reorganization thereof, must not touch.<br/><br/>START OF THE MATCH<br/><br/>The ball is at the very beginning of the match, is the &quot;goal area&quot;, where the attack begins.<br/> - Simultaneity - in one move, and attack and defense can move the two players. The moves are played by, the defense coach writes his move on the paper (the number of players who move and index fields in which the player moves) and, only after the attacker on board their moves, defensive coach illustrates what is written.<br/> - If defensive coach read intention of the attacker and put his players in the path of movement of the ball, it belongs to a player who had intercepted and the defense moved to stage attacks.<br/><br/>ATTACK<br/><br/>- Dribbling - moving the player with the ball for a field. It is usually used in combination with the movement of another one of his teammates.<br/>- Short pass - The longest short pass is two fields and it can be added along the line that goes from the vertex of a field from which threads are added to the next adjacent field. <br/>- Long pass - it only adds to the field where the player is (the place), on any field in the &quot;game zone&quot; which is not in contact with the &quot;line out&quot;. If, over the fields to which is added to the ball, no defensive player, the pass is successful. If the defensive player finds himself in a field environment to which is added, the ball belongs to the defender, long pass is imprecise. Long ball passing levels can not turn back.<br/>- Receiving the ball (Zidane) - Any player who receives the short pass,can move one field with the ball.<br/>- Empty space - The ball can be added (short or long passing) the exact area where the other player or standing next to a field, and with run player receives the ball (after which it is entitled to move to another area, with the ball, if it is short pass, Zidane).<br/>- Return the pass - The level of the ball, only once during the attack, may move the gear (ball usually has to go forward).<br/>- Construction of positions - To be a player kicked, or center the added debt on the pass must first be moved from his position dribbling.<br/>- Play - The ball in the turn, must not stay on same place.<br/><br/>SCORING<br/><br/>",

Out of the thousands and thousands of songs you&rsquo;ve heard in your life, you can single one out within a second or two from hearing just a few words - it&rsquo;s pretty amazing! Music Mania is based on that simple principle and then taken to a whole new level of awesomeness: If I sing two words from a song, can you guess what the song is? I bet you can!<br/><br/>Music Mania is a party style board game with 4 different card categories and 12 different card styles, each of which offer up different challenges. While some of the cards require you to recognize a song in just a word or two, others have you trying to figure out a song when your teammate sings one line in reverse. The gameplay is quick and the laughter a-plenty.<br/><br/>",

The players do this by flicking planets across the board and utilizing gravitational fields to move the planets around each other and the suns.  Players must also be wary of the black-hole in the center of the board that can swallow up the planets left within its gravity field.  The game relies upon a mix of skill and strategy creating exciting shots and chin scratching moments.<br/><br/>Intelligent Design is played on a board with a hexagonal grid.  The grid has 6 solar systems centered on each sun and a black-hole in the center space.  Each player has a set of 10 planets and 2 score tokens in a color that matches the color of a solar system and grid edge.  The planets each have a number between 1 and 8 printed on them and come in three different sizes.  The number on the planet indicates the mass of the planet and its ability to orbit(moving adjacent) planets with smaller numbers.  Each player will take turns flicking and orbiting planets on the board attempting to get as many planets into the Goldilocks Zone of their sun.  The planets are worth an amount of victory points based upon their size with the smallest(and most vulnerable) planets worth the most and the largest worth the least.  Players will have the opportunity to score the planets in the Goldilocks Zone of their sun three times during the course of the game, twice by using score tokens on their turn and again during final scoring.  The winner is the person that has earned the most VP throughout the game.<br/><br/>",

The sounds from the crashing shells concealed the oncoming Chinese, until they burst forward in what was described as &ldquo;a moving carpet of yelling, howling men--whistles and bugles blowing, their officers screaming like women driving their men uphill.&rdquo; In a bunker CP just beneath the crest of the hill Corporal Dale W. Cain heard his radio come alive with reports of &ldquo;enemy in large numbers&rdquo;. Company A reported hand-to-hand fighting in the trenches. The battle was fought in a driving monsoon rain, making evacuation of the wounded difficult, as well as re-supply. As the battle swayed back and forth, the Chinese made repeated pushes to take the hill while both sides unleased a storm of artillery fire upon the struggling soldiers. During the course of two days, parts of four companies defended Pork Chop. At dawn on July 8th, the rain ended for a time and the initial defenders withdrawn. A fresh unit, 2nd Battalion of the 17th, counter-attacked and re-took the hill, then settled in to prepare a defensive perimeter for the coming night.<br/><br/>We suspect the majority of you out there have witnessed the movie &quot;Pork Chop Hill&quot; more than once, with its stirring performance by Gregory Peck. If you are like us, you've seen it over and over again. It's just that good. Our feelings about this film are on par with those we reserve for YOU, our customers, the historical wargamer with the imagination and daring to break out of the rusty cage, genre-wise, that someone once told you was the only place you could maneuver your cardboard warriors. And it is for YOU, the decisive &quot;Lt. Joe Clemons&quot; of tac-sim gamingthat we've created a nifty little treat known as ATS TT BATTLE OF PORK CHOP HILL.

Pieces move 1 or 2 cells forward orthogonally and diagonally, (sideways and backwards moves are not allowed) and captures are made by jumping in straight line over an adjacent friendly piece and falling on an adjacent enemy piece. Captures can be made in any of 4 orthogonal directions (so backwards and sideways captures are allowed, but not diagonally).<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to move one of your pieces out of the board through your opponent's line. Notice that pieces can move 2 cells forward, so you can move out of the board from your opponent's second row. <br/>  <br/>  Best board sizes recommended are 7x8 or 8x8 for square boards.<br/><br/>The game can be played on a hexagonal grid with 5 or 6 cells per side. Here, pieces can move even sideways, but not backward.  The moving piece must advance forward at least one cell at the end of the turn. Captures are made in straight line in any of 6 directions.<br/><br/>",

The mayor watches anxiously as 64 unique characters strategically attack, defend, and use special powers to claim victory. WHICH SIDE WILL YOU TAKE?<br/><br/>In this card game, you choose to defend the innocent or side with evil in a struggle that stretches to every corner of the city. The outcome depends on your ability to strategize against your opponent. There are several paths to victory, but only one side will win.<br/><br/>The objective is to attack your opponents and attain a specified number of Victory Points, which you earn each time a character survives a round. Players draw from a deck of attack cards and prepare strikes by playing three cards of the same attack type: brutal, elemental, science, or stealth. Players may also attempt to thwart enemy attacks with shield cards.<br/><br/>Engage in a back-and-forth style of attacks and take advantage of character strengths, weaknesses, and special powers. Use attack cards to prepare damaging strikes and eliminate your opponents before they eliminate you. There are thousands of possible HERO-VILLAIN combinations so that each match is fresh and competitive. The game rules are easy to learn, but the strategy you devise is limitless.<br/><br/>",

You are simply trying to survive by gathering enough sustenance to satisfy your insatiable hunger, and the only food you crave is BRAAAAAINS!  Be wary though, Zombie hunters, and other players are waiting to disrupt your feeding frenzy!<br/><br/>BRAAAAAINS! has been developed for between 2 to 4 zombies ages 12+, and has an average game time between 5 and 15 minutes.  It&rsquo;s a great game for casual players or others who want a hilariously fun way to slaughter a little &quot;time.<br/><br/>BRAAAAAINS! boasts a total of 52 cards with a lot of attention to detail and fantastic art, and even quirky tongue-in-cheek references and homages to the zombie subculture. It really does show that this has been almost a year in the making!<br/><br/>The deck is opened and the rules card and credits card are removed and the cards are to be shuffled.<br/><br/>Once the cards are shuffled well, the deck is placed center on the table, face down, and scattered around into a heap.<br/><br/>Once the group has decided who will go first, that person will select a card from the heap. If that card is a Brain Card, they will set that card in front of them. They can choose to pass to the next player, or keep drawing.<br/><br/>If the player draws an Incident Card, the player must do what the Incident Card instructs. They must also place the card back into the heap and mix the heap thoroughly.<br/><br/>The play continues this way for each player until a player reaches 10 brains, then that player wins!<br/><br/>",

Each character has some expertise and this expertise allows him to have some skill cards. The game has 5 boards, each board is a company of the same corporation. Each company has a sales goal and the corporation also has a sales goal.<br/><br/>Each round a new crisis/opportunity must be faced by the players, that must co-operate to get the business results desired. They must discuss the crisis/opportunity, suggest a solution to the problem and add skill cards with enough points to solve the problem. The players roleplay their character, move the character thru the board representing the Canvas areas, get new skills, negotiate with the other companies for resources and pick actions to help the company goals. The game ends after 3 hours of play and the results are analized to check if the goals were achieved.<br/><br/>",

Each card left out is deducted from the story poins and the winner is the group/person with the most points.<br/><br/>A second way to play the game is sorting out only the word cards. They are shuffled and the top card revealed. Each person writes down the most synonyms and antonyms for that word card. The winner is the person who writes the most synonyms or anonyms on a selected number of cards.<br/><br/>",

The game can last from 9 turns to around 50.<br/><br/>It can be played in any board size, but 5x5 or 6x6 is recommended.<br/><br/>RULES<br/><br/>Player A uses white balls as the base colour and yellow balls as the upgrade colour. Player B uses the red bals as the base colour and the black balls as the upgrade colour.<br/><br/>The board starts empty. Players take alternate turns placing a ball of their base colour (White or Red) on an empty position.<br/><br/>If, after a player's move, there is at least one straight line of three connected* balls (touching) of their base colour (the lines can be orthogonal or across levels), the player does the following:<br/><br/>1. Chooses any of those lines of three.<br/>2. Removes the maximum number of movable balls from that line. This means that the player must find out the correct order to remove them so he removes the most. Balls may drop as a result of these removals.<br/>3. Places one ball of their upgrade colour on any of the empty spaces that composed the removed line.<br/><br/>The game ends when a player creates at least one straight line of three connected* balls (touching) of their upgrade colour (the lines can be orthogonal or across levels).<br/><br/>If the pyramid fills up without reaching the victory codition the player with most upgrade balls on the board wins.<br/><br/>(*)- Note that flat diagonal lines are not connected!<br/><br/>",

During a round a player will deploy unit cards into their field of battle and attack their opponent. Once a player has worn down his opponent's forces, he can go in for the kill and attack his opponents HQ.<br/><br/>Another element of the game are the special units, giant monsters and constructions that can only be brought into play if you have the resources. These cards are hard to deal with and prevent games from becoming a defensive stalemate.<br/><br/>All of the cards played have a cost, and this cost is dealt with in a unique fashion. Each player has a number of power tokens, and when you play a card, you must give your opponent a number of tokens equal to the cost of the card. This way, if you play a very expensive card, you enable your opponent to match you on their turn. Play a very cheap card however, and you choke your opponents resources, limiting their options.<br/><br/>",

This is a game for 2 or more players with 4 to 20 figures per player. It also includes historical character listings for use in the game.<br/><br/>With these rules, it is possible to design scenarios ranging from the simple to extremely complicated. Examples are provided at the manufacturer's web site for a &quot;St. Valentine's Day&quot; game, as well as a night ambush of a liquor shipment. It would certainly be possible to make a free-for-all with quite a few players - this would be perfect for a convention game.<br/><br/>The ground scale appears to be about 10' to the inch; the time scale is a bit more nebulous. Turns are taken one figure at a time, with initiative order determined by the roll of a d-10. A figure's turn consists of one action, typically a move or a shooting attack, but many other actions are considered by the rulebook.<br/><br/>This game also verges on to a role playing game, with detailed rules for character generation, expenses, costs of equipment, careers, etc. It is possible to play a John Dillinger-like character as well as a Federal Agent such as Melvin Purvis. A fairly comprehensive collection of historical personages are provided pre-made to ease one's task of starting the game up.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A very rare card game from around 1940.<br/><br/>There are 18 sets of three cards per set. When a set is complete, the first card will say a war-time real person's name. The second card will have a short rhyme without the last word and that word appears on the third card in the set (all the last words are illustrated by a food item, hence the name of the game). An example;<br/>General Gort (1st card)<br/>With his army in France, just in CASE,<br/>Our French pals need help to hold Nazis in (both lines 2nd card)<br/>PLAICE (3rd card)<br/><br/>Sets like this help to date the game because France had not fallen at the time of printing. And other sets help as well. Neville Chamberlain was still Prime Minister for instance.<br/><br/>The game mechanic is very much like Rummy card games. You draw and discard cards until you get a set. This is laid before you. The same applies to a second set but now you would be out of cards in your hand so then you have to spend three turns just drawing a new card each time. Once you are up to three cards in your hand, you can collect properly again.<br/><br/>Each set has a point value on the card. In general, the British named character sets are worth between 10 and 20 points. The German characters are worth between 5 or 10 points. Hitler is 10, Goering only 5, for example. You might find it strange that Chamberlain is worth 20 but Churchill only 15. Churchill was not Prime Minister at the time of publication so was not worth the 20 you might have expected.<br/><br/>The round ends when one player has three completed sets. That player collects the point value of each set (the rest score nothing) and a game will last until one player achieves a set score agreed upon at the start. The rules suggest 100 to 200 points.<br/><br/>",

As the sky tends to be a lot less cluttered than the ground, games can be set up quickly and fewer models are required - making for a cheaper night out.<br/><br/>Any number of people can play. As the victory target is dependant on the size of a force, opposing sides don't have to be equally balanced, a smaller or less sophisticated mix of planes can defeat a larger or more advanced enemy by reaching their (lower) victory target first.<br/><br/>Each model represents and individual aircraft or balloon.

        "description": "From the website:<br/><br/>Mig Alley is part of the Wings at War series of wargames rules from Tumbling Dice. Mig Alley is designed for recreating Korean War air combat using Tumbling Dice's 1/600th scale aircraft models.<br/><br/>The games are designed to last around one or two hours. As the sky tends to be a lot less cluttered than the ground, games can be set up quickly and fewer models are required - making for a cheaper night out.<br/><br/>Any number of people can play. As the victory target is dependant on the size of a force, opposing sides don't have to be equally balanced, a smaller or less sophisticated mix of planes can defeat a larger or more advanced enemy by reaching their (lower) victory target first.<br/><br/>Each model represents an individual aircraft or balloon. Elevation is abstracted using 4 levels, and the game uses D6 and D3 (a d6 numbered 1,1,2,2,3,3) for combat resolution.<br/><br/>",

The tiles are laser-engraved and painted. They are 9mm thick, so they can be placed standing up.<br/><br/>There are 60 tiles in 4 colours (yellow, red, green, blue). Each colour has 15 tiles numbered from 1 to 15, which means 2 more tiles per suit than a regular deck, so it can accomodate more players in games like Big Two. Any card game playable with a regular deck can be played with Tiledeck.<br/><br/>Moreover, each tile has been binary coded on its perimeter, by adding 'gates' to some or all of its edges. This opens the path for future games.<br/><br/>Green tiles also have a little spot so that colour-blinds can distinguish them.<br/><br/>",

Hall developed his tactical game system through decades of personal wargaming, and he now shares his unique system with readers everywhere. The rules are easy to learn, and the games are fast-paced. The scenarios cover almost all of the major theaters of conflict, including France 1940, the Mediterranean, the South Pacific, and the Eastern Front. A table of organization and equipment is included to assist readers in recreating wargame infantry and armor formations. Hall doesn't simply provide a set of rules; he infuses each chapter with wargame theory, tactics, and tank development. He provides the logic behind each rule and talks about how the rule design plays out the battlefield. He also shares stories and anecdotes about his early &quot;toy soldier&quot; days and about how he developed into a wargamer-stories sure to spark readers' memories of their own first set of soldiers.<br/><br/>356 pages.

The decision ever facing a great ruler is &lsquo;to expand&hellip;.or not to expand&rsquo;. Players receive florins each turn depending on the number of economic structures the player has constructed. With these florins the Emperor may train creature cards for use in battle, purchase spells from the cities universities, or save for larger upgrades. Once the Emperor has decided on his strategy he must venture forth and take on the world. Villages will be built, towns forged from the ashes of civilization and magical creatures tamed and sent forth to fight for your cause.<br/><br/>A sound strategy is not everything however. Each turn the players must use the spinner, which may lead to an event or knowledge card being drawn. Event Cards can be both a benefit or a burden, whilst Knowledge Cards may recover lost tomes and technologies leading to a mightier empire. Size is not everything!<br/><br/>When a player ventures into an opponents defended province they must battle for control of the land. The size of a players Empire determines the extent of the army that can be fielded, whilst knowledge uncovered may provide an extra boost to your military prowess. The battle itself is a card game based, with the troops you can field being determined by the might of your Empire.<br/><br/>",

Crossing lines adds challenge as your opponent is always trying to block your efforts even as he/she develops his/her own winning line.

        "description": "Songo Ewondo, often just called Songo, is played by the Ekang (also known as &quot;Fang&quot; or &quot;Pangwe&quot;) in Cameroon, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon and the northwest corner of the D. R. of the Congo. It is one of the most popular mancala games.<br/><br/>Songo is known for its rich orature of funny stories, which were recorded by the German anthropologist G&uuml;nter Tessmann (1884 - 1969) in 1907. The game is a popular mindsport in Africa. Songo competitions are held every weekend in Douala, Cameroon.<br/><br/>The game is promoted by the minister for culture and art and the president of the Republic of Gabon, Mr Omar Bongo Ondimba. There are plans to teach Songo at all the schools of the country. Over 200 Songo masters (called &quot;nti&quot;) attend every year a huge tournament in Libreville.<br/><br/>The Songo World Championship in the village of Oyop (South Cameroon) attracts famous players from many countries. The current world champion is the Gabonese Vivi Metou. Other strong players are Endel&eacute;, L&eacute;vy Megne-Masseko, Narcisse Nguema, Davy Obiang, Ta-Ndong, Moulouma, Kamsi, Romy Nguema, Zu&egrave; Allogo, and Desir&eacute; Meba Mefame.<br/><br/>Rules<br/><br/>Songo is played on a mancala board (&quot;mbek&quot;) of 2 x 7 holes. These holes are called &quot;nda&quot; (&quot;house&quot;). At each end there is a big store for the captured counters. Each house contains five stones called &quot;songo&quot; (&quot;pebble&quot;). A player controls the row on his side of the board.<br/><br/>On his turn a player distributes the contents of one of his holes, one by one, clockwise into the ensuing houses. The leftmost hole of a row may only be emptied, if if contains at least three stones unless it would be the only possible move. However, the hole may be emptied, if the move results in a capture or if the opponent has (a) nothing left in his holes and (b) it isn't possible to feed him with three or more stones.<br/><br/>If a hole contained 14 or more stones, it is skipped and all the player's own holes that follow. The remaining stones are only sown on the opponent's side. If the opponent has no stones left, he must be fed with at least seven stones. If this can't be done, he must get as many stones as possible.<br/><br/>A player must move at his turn. If the last stone falls in an opponent's hole, which contained one, two or three stones, its contents are captured together with the last stone (ie. two, three or four stones). If the previous-to-last stone also brought an opponent's house to two, three or four, these are captured as well, and so on. If 14, 21 or 28 stones were sown, only the last stone can be captured, but nothing else.<br/><br/>When a player has only one stone left in his row and this stone is in his leftmost hole, he captures it. If a move would captures all all an opponent's seeds, the capture is forfeited, and the seeds are instead left on the board. The game ends when a player cannot move. The stones that are still on the board are won by the player who moved last.<br/><br/>The player who captured most counters wins. If both players captured the same number, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Malifaux Tactica Wiki:<br/><br/>Nekima is a dual role minion with specialized abilities to provide support, and hard hitting melee power. She does however lack, in the resilience department, and costs quite a lot of SS to bring on the table.<br/><br/>Since this model&rsquo;s release, there was an important change to the Nephilim Heart ability, restricting its application to Terror Tots and Young Nephilims only. This prevented some abuse from the synergy Nekima had with other models, but also severely limited her support abilities to specific minions.<br/><br/>With the latest FAQ update, Wyrd stated that &ldquo;Nekima will get her turn&rdquo; so we can expect that somewhere down the future, she will get a touch up, but there is no way to know to what extent this will affect her.<br/><br/>Nekima is quite specific with her synergies. She works well with the typical Nephilim growth list or other Young Nephilim and Terror Tot based lists. However intended, Nekima&rsquo;s support abilities have short range, and her melee prowess is only really useable if she&rsquo;s protected from harm.<br/><br/>Nekima plays hand-in-hand with growth lists, because she has means to provide blood counters. Rather than draining blood when she kills, she gets a count whenever a living or undead model dies within 3&quot;. This occurs automatically, and even if another model used its Drain Blood, such as a Terror Tot. Remember that most Nephilim are alive and she will get a counter from them too when they die.<br/><br/>",

First released in 2011 as an 'Alpha Run'; then Re-released in it's final version in 2014; as Corporate Wars and Loyalty &amp; Vigilance. Now, we are moving to complete the set with In Defiance of Dictators.<br/><br/>This space-based Card and Dice tabletop game which features epic combat between warships, firefights during Marine boarding actions, and a multitude of clever tactics and galaxy-shaking events, Hull Breach is one of the fastest-growing platforms in the gaming world.<br/><br/>In Hull Breach, you assume command of an advanced space station belonging to one of our several in-game factions and fight it out with one or more other Commanders to achieve galactic domination.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to protect your Station - your home in space - from other Commanders while trying to capture or destroy theirs. Be warned - they&rsquo;re trying to do the same thing to you. It's a tough galaxy and at the end of the day only one Commander will remain standing. Only through careful planning can the most daring gain command of the galaxy.<br/><br/>Each deck of Hull Breach cards consists of fifty-five (55) cards, including a Station, two Station Module enhancements, two Stockpile cards to track your resources and economic wealth, with fifty others to help extend your power across the galaxy. Each pre-constructed deck sports an effective array of the different card types you&rsquo;ll need to wage war against your opponents: Upgrades, Options, Modules, Marines, Ships, Events, Tactics, and Breakthroughs. Once you have a few games under your belt you can mix and match cards from different decks to create your very own personalized fighting force and compete against some of the finest commanders in the galaxy.<br/><br/>Best of all, while we encourage customization and deck-building, this isn't one of those &quot;collectible&quot; card games that will have you tearing through randomized foil packs of cards to find the ones you want. Hull Breach plays right out of the box and you'll know where you can find every card in the game without having to drop a ton of cash on additional boosters or turn to the secondary market to field a competitive deck.<br/><br/>Also, Hull Breach is not only a game, but a developing universe where the players have the opportunity to affect the outcome of the fighting between the factions. In every box you receive a fiction supplement to help you immerse yourself in the Universe&rsquo;s rich backstory, and we are currently in negotiations to expand upon that literary presence. In fact, several of the Reward levels below will allow you to create your own historical presence in the Hull Breach universe.<br/><br/>I'm a returning Commander (player); so what can you tell us about the new Hull Breach Expansion: In Defiance of Dictators?<br/><br/>Hull Breach!: &quot;In Defiance of Dictators&quot; focuses on the rising conflict between the Republic Defense Force and the Colonial Unaligned Forces in the wake of the Corporate Wars. Once again, you take control of one of the faction-controlled stations, build up your fleet and forces, and do battle with any who would attempt to encroach upon your space. Each box set includes four (4) pre-constructed decks (ready to play directly out of the box) complete with all new stations and cards that pit 2 RDF Commanders against 2 Colonial Commanders. Are you ready to fight off the imperialistic monsters, or crush the rebel scum? You decide, you command!<br/><br/>You asked and we listened! Over the course of the last two expansions, we have consistently continued to listen to our players and fan base, in order to continue to expand and improved our Hull Breach Universe. In Defiance of Dictators will include:<br/><br/>- New Team Play and Team Victory Rules<br/><br/>- alternate Victory Conditions; Diplomatic and Economic Victories<br/><br/>- even more Faction-Only cards and effects<br/><br/>- 65 never-before-seen printed cards and artwork, and many necessary revisions to our First-Edition cards<br/><br/>- two new Ship classes; the Freighter and the Transport; in inspire trade between players and aide in the valiant Marine-heavy decks<br/><br/>- a revised Rulebook, complete with easier access rules for beginners; and a digital video rule book put together by the awesome team at 'Skip the Rules'<br/><br/>- a completely all new Fictional Supplement that focuses on the Republic Defense Forces and Colonial Unaligned Forces<br/><br/>- everything you need to enjoy our new Organized Play system<br/><br/>if you have any other questions feel free to email us direct at hullbreachthegame@gmail.com<br/><br/>",

Thereafter play alternates.<br/><br/>Example:<br/>If the Red player has placed his first piece onto an empty space on the board that is within an even numbered row then both players must then play onto all the empty spaces of the even numbered rows first before proceeding to fill the empty spaces of the odd numbered rows. Now if the Red player plays his first piece onto any empty space of an odd row then both players must play onto all of the remaining empty spaces of the odd rows before moving play to the even rows.<br/><br/>The game ends when the board is full.<br/><br/>Scoring<br/>Your score is determined by counting the pieces within the largest Group. Each piece within these Groups are to be counted as 1 point apiece, irrespective of their individual heights.<br/><br/>The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>In the event the largest Groups of both players are the same size at end game, each piece within these Groups are to be counted by their individual height point values (small - 1,medium - 2 and large - 3)and added to determine a winner.<br/><br/>For subsequent draws look at the next largest Groups of each player and apply the same scoring rules.<br/><br/>",

Influence can be used in many ways, including buying items, concealing traits, and bribing other players.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, replicants take damage for each complete oxygen tower, and humans take damage for each incomplete oxygen tower.

The character is one of the IT managers a typical IT department will find. Help-Desk Manager, Data Base Manager and Infrastructure Manager are some examples. Each character has some expertise and this expertise allows him to have some skill cards. The game has 5 boards, each board is a department of the same corporation. Each company has a sales goal and the corporation also has a sales goal.<br/><br/>Each round a new crisis must be faced by the players, that must co-operate to get the business results desired. They must discuss the crisis, suggest a solution to the problem and add skill cards with enough points to solve the problem. The players roleplay their character, move the character thru the board representing the Canvas areas, get new skills, negotiate with the other companies for resources and pick actions to help the company goals. The game ends after 2 hours of play and the results are analized to check if the goals were achieved.<br/><br/>",

Most ot the spaces on the board allow players to choose from a selection of letter tiles, other spaces may allow for the exchange of letters from the letter bank,or the taking of letters from an opponent.

        "description": "Since the time before the plague swept Europe to the final days of the Napoleonic Campaign, bands of soldiers were contracted to protect the interests of the small city states of Europe.These soldiers for hire came to be known as Condottieri. But these soldiers were not just Italian arms for hire, soldiers flooded into the northern Italian city states from all over Europe. German Landsknechte fought alongside Welsh Longbows; Moorish Cavalry rode alongside Albanian Stratioti; Swiss Reisl&auml;ufer and Scottish Highlander Kerns shared in their profits; knights of many noble backgrounds and nationalities toured alongside each other for wealth and glory. Most Famously &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; John Hawkwood, Albertico da Barbiano, Cesare Borgia and Cosimo de&rsquo; Medici all fought as condottiere in various Italian Wars. Conflicts ranged from skirmishes to large scale battles of thousands of heavily armored soldiers fighting to fulfill their contracted duties. This was the dawn of the modern era, the birth of contractual agreement released men from serfdom, and the rise of the first full time professional armies along with their experienced leaders since the fall of Rome.<br/><br/>Condottieri Conflicts is a game which lets players explore the nature of uneasy alliances, allows players to wage battle and negotiate victory conditions in search of riches, glory, and honor. Challenge your friends and family to conflict at its rawest and most cutthroat level. Command your army, form alliances, and backstab your rivals to vanquish the strongest enemies and wage war unlike any other war game you have played before.<br/><br/>This is a game that plays just as well with 2 players as it does with 8. You recieve fully customizable armies ready for medieval warfare, and you also receive Sterritt Strategy&rsquo;s unique terrain system. Great for any gamer who thinks chess could use more realism, Diplomacy&copy; and Risk&copy; lack tactical skill, or might not have the time or space for classic War Games with miniatures. This is for gamers who want a strategic platform that they can tailor to their an hour of leisure time, the rainy afternoon or their multiple weekend long campaigns.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Align is an abstract strategy game whose defining feature is perhaps its multiplicity of win conditions, each subtly related to the others.  It is in fact this feature which provides much of the tactical and strategic richness of the game.  The game is played on a hex grid whose most typical form is a 5x5 hex shaped board minus its center position, but variants can be played on a 4x4 hex board, or a 7x7 or 8x8 diamond shaped board (ala Hex).<br/><br/>There are two kinds of pieces, creatively named &quot;smalls&quot; and &quot;bigs&quot;.  The former are inert, and are placed on the board in any empty position.  The latter are mobile pieces which must first be on boarded onto friendly smalls.  Bigs may capture, as well as be captured (neither applies to smalls).  This occurs via a custodian capture mechanism, whereby two friendly bigs capture an enemy which is sandwiched between them in a line.<br/><br/>The game can be won in any of the following ways:  through the creation of a &quot;snaking&quot; six-in- a-row of uncovered smalls, a snake which may &quot;meander&quot; but not double back on itself; a snaking six-in a-row of bigs; a mixed, big and small, chain, connecting two non adjacent sides of the board (in the 5x5 variant); a similar chain surrounding the board center; or finally, through the capture of three enemy bigs.<br/><br/>",

Each turn, leadership passes around the table. The leader must choose players and non-player characters to send to parts of the ship to solve crazy problems ranging from Bees to evil magicians. The leader must use deduction and input from the crew to send the correct players with the right mix of non-player characters. Mistakes will result in annoying non-player characters driving players insane. Insane players then attempt to murder everyone onboard. Also, if the leader does not send a sufficient number of crew to solve the various problems the ship will eventually explode likely killing everyone onboard.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Two-player card game simulating a fight between kaiju (giant monsters).  Based on a PC game of the same name, the goal of Colossal Kaiju Combat! is to amass less damage to your kaiju than your opponent.<br/><br/>Play comprises three turns, each of which is comprised of three rounds.  In each round players lay 3 attack cards from the common Combat Deck, from their initial hand of 5 attack cards, to be their fighting cards for that round.  Cards are then revealed simultaneously, starting with each player's leftmost card.  Once those are resolved, the second of each player's cards are revealed and resolved.  And again for the last cards.  At the end of each round all cards are returned to the players' hands and an additional card is drawn.  At the end of the turn (3 rounds), all cards are discarded and another 5 cards are dealt to each player from the Combat Deck.<br/><br/>Each player is given, or chooses, a kaiju card at the start of the game which determines stats in four categories as well as buffs such as claws, teeth, tail, etc. which are referenced on various action cards to alter their effects.  The stats limit the types of attack cards that can be played as each action card consumes specified amounts of three of the four stats.  The fourth stat determines how much life the kaiju regains at the end of each turn.<br/><br/>Finally, each attack card is categorized as either a Quick Attack, a Combo Attack, or a Strong Attack and are resolved in that order, possibly rendering an opponent's attack inert.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the kaiju with the least total damage over the course of the game is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The global politics of the late 1920&rsquo;s and early 1930&rsquo;s were in a constant state of flux. The alliances of the world&rsquo;s major nations seemed to change every moment. The American Armed Forces needed to devise plans for any number of possible sudden conflicts. Scenarios were written based on current equipment, technology, and strategy. The Washington treaty of 1922 that limited the tonnage of ships for the major navies never happened. The military&rsquo;s solution was WAR PLAN.<br/><br/>War Plan: Orange was the code name given to the Navy&rsquo;s scenarios dealing with a threat from Japan. Plan Orange was constantly modified as new ships, aircraft, technology, and strategies were improved. Equipment available to both sides at this time would have been fascinating to see in use, as is the focus of this game.<br/><br/>This will be the first of a series of &ldquo;War Plan&rdquo; games from Historical Board Gaming. This boxed game will come complete with all components needed to play. Fight the intense battles between the Japanese and American Navies during the early 1930&rsquo;s that never were. Utilizing fantasy ships like the Lexington Class battle-cruiser as designed before it was converted to an aircraft carrier, and the Colorado class Battleship that was scrapped before building, the American forces will take on Japanese ships like the Tosa, Amagi, Kii, and No. 13 Class Battleships as well as the infamous 3-flight deck versions of Kaga and Akagi. These beautiful ships, as well as aircraft and airships, will be represented in this game with actual plastic ships, planes, and airships based on designs from pre World War II. With pieces that match the scale of other famous games in the genre, fight the Plan Orange scenarios and then add them together with other games to make your own! Never before has a War Plan Orange board game been designed like this!<br/><br/>HBG&rsquo;s War Plan series of games will use the game engine debuted in another of HBG&rsquo;s popular games, The Battle of Midway. Expanding the combat sequence to include new units, these great ships will battle for supremacy of the Pacific. The movement and combat system utilizes an area movement dynamic and D6 damage resolution. Units take turns moving based on unit type, in an attempt to out maneuver enemy units and destroy key targets for victory points.<br/><br/>War Plan: Black is the next planned game in HBG&rsquo;s War Plan series.<br/><br/>Contents will include a map, Japanese and American plastic game pieces, rules, and a battle Board.<br/><br/>Coming in 2014<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game has its players taking turn playing a Hero (Conan, Red Sonja, B&ecirc;lit...). The rest of the players play Hero&rsquo;s foes, fight a round of combat, and then the next player plays his Hero. Hence, only one player is playing a Hero at a time while the rest play his foes. If a player is playing Hero&rsquo;s foes, their Hero is currently inactive and doesn&rsquo;t factor into play. The Hero wins renown points by defeating his enemies. There are various victory conditions (the first player to reach 40 renown, the last player with a surviving Hero, or the last player with cards left to play wins the game).<br/><br/>Each player starts with one Hero card, a foe deck and a draw deck. Players randomly decide who will go first. That player becomes the active player, and places his Hero card in the center of the table and is considered to be playing the Hero. All players then draw cards form their draw deck and play begins. The Hero player then can place into play any allies and locations that he or she might have and also place items and weapons on his Hero card for use them in the upcoming combat. Whether or not cards can be placed into play depends on several factors, but the main mechanic for both foes and the Hero is their pool of prowess points. Most cards have a prowess cost that gets subtracted from this pool in order to place a card into play.<br/><br/>Then the foes draw from their foe deck a number of cards partly based upon how many much renown the Hero has. For every foe the Hero kills, that player places that foes card into the area known as the chronicle. Each foe has a renown score, and the total of all the felled&rsquo; foes renown score in Conan&rsquo;s chronicle is his renown score.<br/><br/>The more defeated foes in a Hero's chronicle, the more foes the opposing player gets to put into play, i.e. the more famous the Hero gets, the more enemies want to take him down. Once the foe pool is drawn, the foe players then decide which of these foe cards they want to put into play. There are major and minor foes and rules governing how many foes from the foe draw can be put into play. Once the foes decide which of their foe cards they are able and want to play, they place their foe cards into 4 zones around the Hero(front, left, right and rear). They then place &ldquo;move&rdquo; cards from their draw deck for each foe they have assigned to do battle with the Hero. These cards are placed face down and represent both offensive and defensive elements. The Hero player then responds to these move cards with his own move cards, placed face up, to counter each foes&rsquo; move card. Hero&rsquo;s move cards also incorporate both offensive and defensive elements. The foes then reveal their move cards and combat is resolved. If any of the foes are left alive, all players draw cards from their draw deck, and the surviving foes place new move cards onto the table. The Hero once again counters, combat is resolved, etc. until either the Hero retreats or defeats all his foes. If the Hero retreats he loses renown. If he defeats all of his foes, the Hero then can decide to rest and replenish his prowess pool and a small fraction of his life points. The Hero can also &ldquo;press on.&rdquo; If the Hero presses on, he starts a new round of combat, but does not get to replenish any prowess or life. Once the Hero rests or retreats, the next player then becomes the Hero.<br/><br/>Play continues until a victory condition is met (the first player to reach 40 renown, the last player with a surviving Conan, or the last player with cards left to play).<br/><br/>Each player must provide two decks which meet the appropriate requirements. The Draw Deck must contain at least 40 non-foe cards. No more than 3 copies of any given card are allowed, with no more than 1 copy of any unique card. The Foe Deck must contain at least 25 foe cards. No more than 3 copies of any given foe card (or 1 copy of any unique card) are permitted. The total renown of the foes in the Foe Deck must total from 95 to 105 points.<br/><br/><br/>Hasta el momento han aparecido:<br/><br/>01. Set B&aacute;sico<br/>02. Brujos Resentidos<br/>03.

        "description": "The trusting past has led to a densely woven international trading network with the energy market at its center. Skepticism and fear have flooded the international political scene. Impending crisis has prompted world powers to escalate energy independence to a matter of national security and quick action must be taken. Not too quick though&hellip; poor decisions could drag a country to the brink of collapse. All world powers are simultaneously seeking security, and no one country&rsquo;s decision ever goes without consequence. Take control, strategize, and maneuver your way to victory through a composite blend of dynamic geopolitics, economics and investment. But remember, your plan must be as innovative, versatile, and forgiving as the volatile energy market itself.<br/><br/>Object of the game:<br/>The goal of the game is to completely develop your country&rsquo;s oil and renewable energy resources and have 21 developments before any other player. A person's strategy must be fluid in order to adapt to the politics in play, the patents owned, and the country's resources.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>Each round begins with a politics card which introduces a governing rule that all players must abide by. They compound for 4 consecutive rounds and then begin again simulating a presidential cycle.<br/><br/>Also at the beginning of each round a patent card is auctioned off. Patents give players ownership of specific technologies that will increase their profits or allow them to develop at a faster rate.<br/><br/>Play proceeds with individual turns. Each player begins his/her turn by rolling 2 dice which determines if the price of an energy development increases or decreases. A disaster can also occur which destroys the player's most developed land plot.<br/><br/>Once the price is set, that player can either purchase developments, pay back debt, invade another country, or take no action and save his her money. Each turn ends by collecting profits ($100 per domestic development unless patent says otherwise).<br/><br/>The first player to build all 21 energy developments on their country and pay off all debt wins the game!<br/><br/>",

The distance your car moves depends on the interaction between the parts of your car, and the prevailing condition of the track and the weather.<br/><br/>As an action you can play a card from your hand to replace parts of your car or driver to improve the distance your car moves.  You can also play a card to replace the prevailing conditions, possibly increasing your car movement, or adversly effecting the movement of the other players.  There are also obstacle cards to slow down another player.  'Revira volta' cards swap the driver or parts of the car amongst all the players.  At the end of your turn you draw cards to return to a hand of 5.<br/><br/>Use your action wisely because in Revira Volta the winner is the player who can overcome obstacles, and use the weather variations and changes to the race track to their best advantage!&quot;<br/><br/><br/>Pra vencer essa corrida vale tudo: trocar o terreno da pista, as condi&ccedil;&otilde;es do clima, colocar obst&aacute;culos na frente dos oponentes, e at&eacute; mesmo trocar o seu carro ou o piloto !!!<br/><br/>Jogo de tabuleiro para todas as idades, criado durante o SPJam 2013.<br/><br/>O Jogo: <br/>&quot;Em Reviravolta, todos come&ccedil;am com um carro e cinco cartas na m&atilde;o.

Corporations, fueled by their desire for wealth and power, race for the chance to be the supplier of these resources. In seven years, the rest of Earth's corporations will have caught up and the ridiculous prices for these precious materials will start to drop. Be the corporation that profits the most and show the galaxy who is the best.<br/><br/>Asteroid Miner is a worker placement and resource management board game in which players are the CEO of one of the first corporations to make mining the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter profitable. Players play for a maximum of six rounds, which represent a year in space. Each round, players must pick a special subcontractor card which gives special powers for the rest of the round. During the round players must choose where to send their crews: mine, blast, upgrade, or pick up contracts.<br/><br/>",

Each game includes an authentic Chinese i-ching coin. In Hei Su Hong Su, when tokens are moved off one end of the board, they return on the opposite side. Additionally, unlike other popular strategy games, players are permitted to move neutral and their opponent&rsquo;s tokens as their own. Hei Su Hong Su is truly a unique and intriguing strategy game.<br/><br/>In Hei Su Hong Su, one player is red, other is black. At the start of the game, each player has nine pieces set up in a square in opposite corners on the board, with 18 white pieces occupying the other two corners. Players take turns &ldquo;sliding&rdquo; rows or columns of pieces by removing a piece from an edge and adding it to the other edge. If a player traps a piece by surrounding it with 4 of his color (including &ldquo;wrapping around&rdquo; to the other side of the board), it is replaced with with one of that player's pieces. If a player captures and replaces a white piece, the &ldquo;tug of war&rdquo; marker moves 1 in his favor on the scale. If a player captures and replaces an opponent&rsquo;s piece, the marker moves 2 in his favor on the scale. The game ends when the marker has moved all the way to the end of the scale; that player is the winner.<br/><br/>",

It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square or rectangular board. Board sizes bigger than 9x9 are not recommended. 6x7 boards have been used in some human matches.<br/><br/>NoGo takes the Go concepts of group and liberty and uses them in the most minimalistic possible way. The resulting game, with no captures, no cycles and no scoring, is no rival for Go, but remains a fertile ground for tactical challenges in the Dots and Boxes style.<br/><br/>This game seems to have been first mentioned by someone called John Moore at Sensei's Library, in April 1, 2005.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsA group is a set of orthogonally adjacent, like-colored stones.<br/><br/>A liberty of a group is an empty point orthogonally adjacent to that group.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On his turn, a player must place a stone of his color on an empty point of the board. At the end of a turn, all groups on the board (both friendly and enemy) must have at least one liberty. Otherwise the player's move is illegal. Whoever can't make a move on his turn loses.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Disintegrate your friends!<br/><br/>Ray Gun Roulette is a high tech, high stakes game of bluffing for 2 to 10 players. Players are participating in this deadly game to acquire as many crystals as they can. Choose from an assortment of highly illegal firearms and blast away until you're either the last player alive or you possess all the crystals!<br/><br/>Each player starts with two primary shields (blue gems) and three crystals (the currency of the game). If a player runs out of crystals they have lost the game. A primary shield can absorb one blast from one of these lethal firearms, if a player gets hit with just one of these weapons unshielded, they will get disintegrated, and lose the game. The weapon cards contain all the information needed to use them.<br/><br/>Each weapon, in addition to the illustration and weapon name, have a number of features,<br/>-Kill-o-watt rating: the power rating of the weapon, if both players are targeting each other, the higher kill-o-watt weapon wins and damages their target.<br/>-Deflector shield rating: some weapons have a built-in deflector shield. It can deflect a shot coming from a player that you are not targeting this round. If the kill-o-watt rating is less than or equal to the deflector shield rating (remember to multiply the deflector rating by 1,000 before comparing) the shot has no effect. Otherwise the shot goes through and can be absorbed by a primary shield or disintegrate the player.<br/>-Special ability: each weapon has a unique special ability. Some of these can be particularly game-changing and devastating. Any player may negate the special ability of a weapon at the cost of one crystal (thrown into the pot for the current round), once per round, immediately after the effect would have taken place.<br/><br/>A round of Ray Gun Roulette has a number of phases,<br/>-Choose weapons, dealer deals each player 3 cards, they choose one and discard the rest.<br/>-Ante up!, each player places a crystal in the pot.<br/>-Aim, players pick a target, making a &quot;gun&quot; hand pointing at them. This stage is when the bluffing really takes place, feel free to switch targets, intimidate, trash talk, and fold at any time.<br/>-Last chance, Dealer declares &quot;Last chance to fold, targets locked!&quot;. From this point on players cannot switch targets. Players may not fold once this phase has ended.<br/>Fire!, all together players call out &quot;3, 2, 1, FIRE!&quot; and flip over their cards, revealing what weapons they were using.<br/>-Determine winners, Determining the winner is simple; if you lost a primary shield this round or were disintegrated, you lost. Otherwise the player has won and will split the pot with the other winners. crystals that cannot be split evenly between the winners remain in the pot for the next round.<br/>-Play continues until either one player has all the crystals or is the only one alive.<br/><br/>",

They are trying to out do each other by getting the most satisfied customers. Each customer's order is determined by rolling three special dice (meat, pasta, and sauce). The chefs must race against each other to fulfil the orders using the cards in their hand, the deck, and the pantry. The chef with the most satisfied customers by the end of the game is the winner!<br/><br/>The board game is a table, set for four persons. To begin the game you place a meeple (patron) in each chair. Determine each patron's order by rolling their own set of special dice, one each of a sauce, meat, and pasta die. The players (chefs) then have to match the patron's order by drawing cards from the grocery delivery (deck) or the pantry (three piles of discarded cards, shared by everyone, that haven't been used to fill an order). Once an order has been filled the player shows everyone their match, moves the patron next to them to keep score, places the used cards in the bus bin (discard pile, you can never dig from the trash to complete an order, that's gross!), and finally seats a new patron (if any are left) and rolls a new order for them. Play continues until everyone has been served.<br/><br/>In addition to the six types of pasta, meat, and sauce cards there are also wild cards and secret ingredient cards (a pasta, meat, or sauce that counts as any other type, but you can only use one to fill an order). There are variations for faster games: using less patrons and/or removing the meat cards and dice (light lunch).<br/><br/>",

Sigrid, who has the soul of a huntress, is a formidable walker pilot. She was one of the very first of these on the planet, since the first prototype of the Luther was created. Now she hunts her preys amidst the ruins of Zverograd.<br/><br/>As you can see this &ldquo;Elite Version&rdquo; comes with a special diorama base that can also serve as a playing base for the Snow Lynx. It takes a little bit more than one space on the battlefield, but consider it as one space. The walker can also be placed on a regular grey round base that we have magnetized: you can swap the Snow Lynx from one base to another with ease.<br/>We also magnetized Sigrid: she can be played independently, the rock under her feet is the same size as a regular base. And thanks to the magnet she can be placed back on the large base with her walker instantly. In an instant Sigrid and the Snow Lynx can go from a Collector Item to being fully playable. And of course, as usual, everything is already painted and you can enjoy it as soon as you open the box.<br/><br/>This brand new JagdLuther model has a &ldquo;belly&rdquo; machine gun, that can be used with deadly effects against any infantry.<br/><br/>Of course these two models come with their very own unit cards, and are fully playable in Dust Tactics and Dust Warfare.<br/><br/>",

Whenever the pasture (Sheep deck) is empty, the game is over and whoever has the most sheep in their pen is the winner.<br/><br/>On your turn, you will draw a card from the duty deck, and then you will perform two actions.  Those actions are A) drawing a card from the duty deck B) playing a card from your hand or C) herding a sheep aka taking the top card from the sheep deck and putting it in your pasture.<br/><br/>Some of the sheep cards are rare sheep such as the Ninja Sheep, the Fat Sheep, the Buff Sheep, or the Goat. Each special sheep has a special ability printed on the card.  Most of the sheep in the sheep deck are normal mundane sheep, however.<br/><br/>In the 30 min game some of the cards you will draw (duty cards) will help you herd more sheep or perform more actions, but many of the duty cards are harmful to your opponents, such as sending feral corgis to kidnap their sheep or even worse, infecting an opponent with rabies.<br/><br/>",

You need one Mystique Deck to play the game.<br/> In Mystique Guilds, the combination of suit+colour is called &lsquo;guild&rsquo;. So there are 12 guilds (3 colours times 4 suits). Your goal is to control the most guilds when the game ends.<br/><br/>Shuffle the whole deck and place it facing down in the middle of the table. This is the Draw Deck. Next to it a (now inexistent) Discard Deck will be created.<br/><br/>Determine the starting player by any peaceful means. Players take turns in anticlockwise order during the game until the endgame condition is reached.<br/><br/>On their turn, players must do only one of these 2 actions:<br/><br/>- Pick one card from the Draw Deck or the Discard Deck.<br/><br/>- Buy cards.<br/><br/>How to buy cards:<br/><br/>1. Place one of your cards facing up before you. This is the Influence Card.<br/><br/>2. Draw up to as many cards from the Draw Deck as the number on your Influence Card.<br/><br/>3. Place the Influence Card facing up on the Discard Deck.<br/><br/>If, at any moment, the Draw Deck gets exhausted, the game ends.<br/><br/>Each player adds up the values of each guild on their hand. The player with the highest value for each guild controls that guild and scores a point (tip: score the 12 guilds in order for clarity). In case of two or more players having the same value for a guild, none of them scores for it. The guild of blue suns is an exception and scores two points. So there are 13 available points in total.<br/><br/>Ties for the first place are broken by the lowest number of cards. If a tie persists then play again.<br/><br/>Variants:<br/><br/>Variant 1: Cards can be bought from both decks.<br/><br/>Variant 2 (the Market): You can buy cards from another player. Both players must agree on the cards being exchanged. The Influence card is given to that player instead of discarding it.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Superpowerful Bonanza is a handmade cardboard/spruce-wood multilevel three-dimensional board game developed by You Tube's Homemade Game Guru. The game features a new line of comic book superheroes competing to save their city from five super villain bosses. Each hero character has an origin story and mission to complete (explained in an accompanying one-shot comic book). The game play was inspired by classic side-scrolling video games like Double Dragon and Contra.<br/><br/>Each hero and villain has a main game card that lists their 1)strength, 2)speed and 3)intelligence points. Each hero must add to their strength, speed and intelligence points by collecting cards based on weapons, health, powers and superpowers. Cards are collected by moving along playing spaces in each level. Game cards accumulated not only provide point levels for strength, speed and intelligence, but they also give specific instructions on their limitations and extra abilities. Some cards can be kept and others are one-time use.<br/><br/>Players compete to gain as many points as possible before taking on each level's villainous boss. Each boss has a complete deck of cards to fuel their strength, speed and intelligence points. Once a boss is reached, a player must duel card-to-card and hope they have the right combination of points to win. Even before players reach the level boss, they must combat minor enemies and deal with civilians (which can help or hinder the mission). Each of the 5 levels plays slightly different from the rest.<br/><br/>",

If the second player's card followed two aspects, then the other players must follow both.<br/><br/>This game uses the following ranking:<br/><br/>     suit: suns &gt; moons &gt; arms &gt; crowns<br/>     number: 5 &gt; 4 &gt; 3 &gt; 2 &gt; 1<br/>     color: yellow &gt; red &gt; blue<br/><br/><br/>The trick winner is determined as follows:<br/><br/>     Following suit: Highest number; tie goes to highest color.<br/>     Following color: Highest suit; tie goes to highest number. <br/>     Following number: Highest color; tie goes to highest suit.<br/>     Following suit and color: Highest number.<br/>     Following suit and number: Highest color.<br/>     Following color and number: Highest suit.<br/><br/><br/>Should no one be able to follow a led card, the trick leader wins the trick.<br/><br/>Each trick won is worth 1 point.<br/><br/>Advanced Scoring Variant: Balance<br/>Each player earns points in three categories:<br/><br/>     Tricks won following suit.<br/>     Tricks won following color.<br/>     Tricks won following number.<br/><br/><br/>When a player wins a trick, she earns one point in the appropriate category. If she won a trick that followed two aspects, she earns one point in each of those two categories! Your category with the lowest score is what counts toward winning.<br/><br/>",

We&rsquo;ll call it 'Coinland'.<br/><br/>'Coinland' is full of coins, one coin per cell with the exception of the central one. Each cell is connected to its neighbouring cells by an edge. The 'Hoarder' will try to collect as many coins as possible by moving from cell to cell, while the 'Gatekeeper' will try to collect coins by &lsquo;taxing&rsquo; the Hoarder, placing gates on the edges between cells and charging a fee each time the Hoarder crosses them.<br/><br/>Use loose change or draughts pieces or beans or whatever to fill the cells. Keep the centre cell empty.<br/><br/>The Hoarder uses a chess pawn (or any other object that fits inside a cell). The Gatekeeper uses a marker of a different colour than the edges of the board (if possible). Place the Hoarder piece in the centre cell.<br/><br/>Starting with the Gatekeeper, players alternate turns during the game until all coins have been collected or the Hoarder is not able to move, whatever happens first.<br/><br/>On her turn, the Gatekeeper must draw a gate in any edge between 2 cells.<br/><br/>And on her turn, the Hoarder must move her piece in a straight line to a non-empty cell (it must contain a coin) as many spaces as she wishes in any of the 6 directions. She must pay as many coins to the Gatekeeper as gates she crossed during the move (she cannot move if she doesn&rsquo;t have coins enough to pay). Hoarder collects the coin that is on the destination cell. Moving is mandatory if possible. The hoarder can declare the end of the game after her turn.<br/><br/>When the game ends, count the coins that the Hoarder has managed to keep. This is her score. Then reverse roles and play again. Whoever achieved the highest score playing as the Hoarder wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Grad Wars all players are students in different Universities. Their aim is to get their degree before everyone else does by passing 20 lessons first. They do this either by studying hard, or by visiting the other players in their classroom and harassing them.<br/><br/>Players can pass up to 5 lessons in every turn. They get their grade by rolling a 10-sided die for every lesson and then modifying the die with cards thrown by themselves or other players.<br/><br/>Cards can be adding or subtracting from a grade, and they can be special cards. But basically they describe student life as it is, or rather as we think it is. Players drink tons of coffee, they get shut in in bunkers to study focused, and they give exams using a Divine Pen. They also invade other players&rsquo; homes to sabotage their alarm clock, and they cause a Zombie Apocalypse inside other players&rsquo; classrooms. And they start crying in front of professors to get a passing grade, they cheat like there is no tomorrow, and they go to parties that cause year-long hangovers. Grad Wars is a game for the students who want to get their degree first no matter what the cost, or the means.<br/><br/>&Sigma;&tau;&omicron; &pi;&alpha;&iota;&chi;&nu;ί&delta;&iota; &alpha;&upsilon;&tau;ό &omicron;

Tiles are added to the end of other tiles just like in Dominoes except that points are gained based on the tile played.  Players will then call out the correct answer to the math equation that they made and gain points if they're correct or possibly lose points if they're wrong.  Special lock tiles will make it where other players can't play on that end unless they have a special unlock tile.  The player whose points are closest to the target number that is rolled at the beginning of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Genpei Kassen (源平合戦) is part of the 'historical' division of Bandai's 'if' series of games. It is translated as 'Genpei War'. The 'Gen' is the Chinese pronunciation of the character for Minamoto, one of the two main combatants. 'Pei' (or 'Hei) similarly refers to the Taira, so it's the 'Minamoto-Taira War'. A strategic simulation of the 1180-1185 conflict in Japan involving the Minamoto and Taira warrior houses, it reflects the fact that fighting was not done strictly along 'clan' lines by including as other factions the Kiso (a branch of the Minamoto), the Fujiwara, and the Imperial Family. The war is still a popular subject in Japan today, being immortalized by period literature such as the Heike Monogatari ('Tale of the Heike') and live performances by blind biwa (lute) players.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 2-4 players taking the part of one of the four main combatants-the Taira (SW Japan), Kiso (a Minamoto branch, central Japan), Minamoto (SE Japan), and Fujiwara (N Japan). There are rules for a 5th player to operate abstractly as the Insei (retired Emperor) Go-Shirakawa, meddling with the plans of the four warrior houses. There are several different scenarios involving different numbers of players and levels of conquest. Gameplay features area movement of generic land and naval forces. Armies are generic and all have the same value, and are boosted by the values of leaders accompanying them. None of the leaders are named but each has a different skill level (if you're familiar with the history, it's easy to figure out the names that go with each leader counter). Naval warfare and sea movement of troops is somewhat abstract and confined to the southern areas of the map. Cardplay has a big effect on gameplay as cards can lead to possession of the Emperor, abundant crops, famine (denying victory points), access to independent naval forces, and other events. Victory is determined by both provinces held each turn (each province is worth a varying number of points) and enemy units destroyed.<br/><br/>Starting positions for the game are somewhat historically inaccurate; this was done for play balance as the Kiso are facing a two front war with the other combatants initially only having one. Factions are differentiated by their leader and naval pools. The Fujiwara have no navy, three overpoweringly wealthy provinces, and have the strongest leader in the game (and an extremely strong sub-leader). The Kiso have a middling leader, no navy, 23 relatively poor provinces, and a small pool of back up leaders. The Minamoto have a solid and large leadership pool but no navy and start with 14 provinces worth a moderate amount. The Taira have the misfortune of having an excellent leader being a subordinate of the worst leader in the game, but start off with naval forces and 20 moderately valuable provinces. There are also 3 neutral provinces that can be invaded during the game. Overall, the game has a good feel for the war it seeks to recreate and the difficulties faced by each faction.<br/><br/>",

This is a full-fledged space empire game featuring exploration, expansion, exploitation of galactic resources AND space combat.  However, it eschews the extermination or elimination of weaker players by allowing the stronger ones to become their overlords, thus extending to them a measure of protection.<br/><br/>The order of game play is on a round system where players do their empire production simultaneously in a production phase.  Then the players do two actions each, in turn order, in the action phase.  In their actions, players may engage their opponents by diplomacy, trade, and espionage as well as military ventures.  Or they may go off on their own to explore for rewarding encounters.<br/><br/>The building of economic engines will not be enough to win.  There is a shifting economy and there are changes to game conditions with the passing of ages.  Players must be willing to abandon hard-won colonies in order to adapt to the changes.  The game can be customized in many ways, one being the duration of the game can be set to any number of rounds the players want.  Players can set limits on the aggression level of the game if they desire a more peaceful experience.  There is a four player introductory game designed to introduce players to the basics of the game.  In this &quot;intro&quot; game, the special alien abilities and technologies are not used, thus placing players on an equal footing.<br/><br/>A variety of mechanisms are employed which are designed to quash the common complaints that tend to occur in multiplayer conflict games.<br/><br/>There are several possible ways the game can end in addition to timing out on the last round.  Players are rewarded on a point system for their accomplishments such their as economy, technology, exploration, military, cultural and diplomatic achievements.  The highest score gains the win.<br/><br/>",

However, a cat and a ratcatcher are looking to catch the rats. Each rat has a special ability that can help ensure victory. With a little luck and some skill, the rats will find what they need in town, all the while wearing dapper hats, of course!<br/><br/>Players, as rats, collect Food cards to place in their buffets to complete Entrees given to them at the start of the game. To collect Food cards, players roll a die and move into different locations, such as a bakery or a butcher shop. There are five different types of food: Bread, Fruit, Meat, Vegetable, and Cheese. The different locations offer these types of Food. For example, when a rat enters the Cheese Shop, he or she draws a card from the Cheese deck. Or, when a rat enters the Pastry Shop, he or she draws a card from either the Bread deck OR the Fruit deck.<br/><br/>Then, the rats add cards to their buffets from their hands, but only one at a time. After that, the player switches into the role of the cat and/or ratcatcher. He or she rolls the Enemy die and moves the cat and/or ratcatcher accordingly. When the cat enters the same tile as a rat, he or she must discard a card in hand. When the ratcatcher enters the same tile as a rat, he or she must lose a card from his or her buffet. So, players can use the cat and ratcatcher to keep other rats in check if a player is getting too far ahead.<br/><br/>The game moves to a final turn when a player has ten Food cards in his or her buffet OR when any Food deck runs out of cards. Then, the player with the most points, when adding up all of his or her Entrees and Food cards, wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "An elegant game based off the traditional gambling game of the fierce and reclusive konog species, a secretive and xenophobic race from a remote corner of the galaxy. This game, enjoyed for years by the expeditionaries and pioneers in the Industrial Sectors, has only recently been introduced to the Core Systems.<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to make a number of &quot;Konogs&quot;; which is either three cards of the same number of any suit, or a run (1, 2, 3) of three cards of the same suit. After playing a Konog, the fourth card left in your hand is placed in front of you, this is the value of that Konog. At the end of the game (after one player has performed a sixth Konog and all other players have taken one last turn) these values are added together (plus any triumvirates) to find the player's total ending score. The player with the highest score is the winner.<br/><br/>Note: you will need a large plate (or a rotating tray, like a Lazy Susan) to play Konog. As a player discards, many cards will make the discard piles (one for each player) rotate in different directions. Also included in the game are wooden &quot;sentries&quot;, you can place these on a discard pile to protect a card from being taken or covered up by another player.<br/><br/>Konog has many features that set it apart from other games. Inside each game box you can expect to find: simple, yet elegant artwork featured on circular cards, a completely alien numerical system based on three (don't worry, standard numbers are featured at the bottom of each card for those that are unfamiliar with the Konog numeral system), colorful wooden pieces (a sentry and matching post for each player), and a drawstring bag to hold everything.<br/><br/>",

These past selves can be intersected, fought and killed, altering the history of the game so far.<br/><br/>For instance, if a Fighter is killed, another Fighter in their squad can go back in time and kill their killer before they were killed, reviving them.<br/><br/>Play Summary<br/><br/>Each Player starts with 3 Fighters on a 2-dimensional board (one dimension is space, one is time). Each turn, players activate a square with one of their Fighters, which either activates combat (if enemies are in the square), or allows that Fighter to move. Combat is decided via secretly selected cards for each Fighter. Some moves allow the Fighters to travel in time, but will, over time, lock off the board to Time Travel, preventing others from doing the same.<br/><br/>Fighters can also grab items in the square they're in, which will give them extra abilities in their future.<br/><br/>Players get Victory Points for:<br/><br/>     having living Fighters,<br/>     killing other Fighters,<br/>     having Fighters with long timelines,<br/>     travelling backwards in time; and<br/>     grabbing VP items on the board<br/><br/><br/>The Fight ends when an entire squad is dead, most of the board is locked, or a player reaches 8 Victory Points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "BACKGROUND: Blades of Honor is an adventure game for 1-4 Players, where the players assume the roles of young Samurai in Late Medieval Japan (1450-1600). Each Player creates a Samurai Character in the service of a minor Lord called a Hatamoto. As a loyal retainer, the Player-Samurai must complete various assignments for his Hatamoto such as escorting envoys, participating in Battles, dueling rival Samurai, framing rival Hatamoto, and assassinations. As your Samurai gains experience and renown they can improve their attributes and eventually prove their worth in order to one day, become a Hatamoto himself and possibly the Provincial Lord or Daimyo!<br/><br/>GAME OBJECTIVE: The Objective of each Player-Samurai is to become the Daimyo of his Province. In order to become a Daimyo, the Player-Samurai must accomplish the following:<br/>1. Samurai must complete Assignments to earn enough Renown Points to be selected as Hatamoto during the Dynasty Phase of the Player Turn.<br/>2. Once he is a Hatamoto, the Player Samurai must earn enough Renown Points to be selected as Daimyo during the Dynasty Phase or after all Rival Hatamoto have been conquered or eliminated.<br/><br/>GAME FEATURES: Blades of Honor features a flavorful Large-Hex Map with Villages, Castles, Mountains, Paddies, Forests and Rivers. Also, there are many, many colorful counters of Samurai, Ronin, Bandits, Bushi Warriors, Monks, and various mythologcal creatures and monsters!<br/><br/>This is basically a Role-Playing Boardgame of Epic Adventure. If you are a fan of Samurai movies and legends, then this is the game for you.<br/><br/>",

In it he sets out to dispel the notion that patience is a therapeutic pastime for the simple-minded and the idle rich. Whereas previous compilations have tended to copy one another in jumbling good, bad, and indifferent games with no sense of order, the author has here adopted a systematic approach enabling the browser to pick out the type of game most appealing to his or her own taste and mood of the moment. Three major groups are distinguished. First come the attractive and simple games requiring care and patience to bring them out, then games requiring a balance of judgement and card sense and finally those which call for the type of positional analysis more usually associated with chess problems than card games. Each group is further subdivided in a way which generally proceeds from the small and simple to the large and complex.<br/><br/>",

It introduces the German Volkssturm forces available near the end of the war.  You must own Combat Leader:  East Front '41 to use this expansion.<br/><br/>It includes a counter sheet (Set D) with 27 Volkssturm men, and a new 12-man Russian first line squad, as well as Map 5 (8.5&quot;x11&quot;), additional Reference Card, and instruction folder.  New rules cover the use of Volkssturm in scenarios, and special rules governing their use.  Also instructions governing the use of improvised weapons (such as antique rifles, shotguns, the MP 3008, and panzerfausts) are provided.  Finally, Scenario VKS-1 (Outskirts of Berlin) lets you use the new components in a situation set in Greater Berlin, May 1945.<br/><br/>Like the previous expansion, this one builds on the foundation provided in the core rules, and is compatible with any Combat Leader game.<br/><br/>",

It's portable and meant to be taken to dinner with you, played between the time you order and when your food arrives.<br/><br/>This is a family-friendly dice game that takes 5 minutes to learn and 15-20 minutes to play. It is suitable for 2-10 players and can be learned by children as young as 5 years old. It fits in your pocket and travels well, so it makes a great game to leave in the car, take to the laundromat, take to dinner with you, or pack in your carry-on luggage.<br/><br/>Rules<br/>Each player rolls 5 randomly selected dice, separating the Knights, Villagers, and Barricades, as well as any special dice. Barricades get rerolled, drawing up to 5 more dice to roll each turn.<br/><br/>You may stop any time and return to your lair, eating the number of Villagers on the board. That number is added to your next turns, until you have 15 or more, and are full, winning the game.<br/><br/>5 Knights vanquishes the dragon, ending your turn with 0 points.<br/><br/>If you roll a Wizard (one of the specialty dice), he casts his Magic if and only if 2 Knights are on the board to protect him. Wizard's Magic vanquishes the dragon, ending your turn with 0 points. Without 2 Knights, he counts as a Villager.<br/><br/>If you roll a Dragon (the other specialty dice), you cast your Fire Breath attack. This burns all Barricades, revealing the delicious Villager goodness inside. It also melts the armor of 1 Knight, taking that die out of play. Then the Dragon also goes out of play. Count the Villagers and return to your lair or continue your turn, at your choice.<br/><br/>Play continues until some dragon/player has eaten 15 or more Villagers and is satiated. Everyone left in that round of play still gets a turn to try and beat the high score.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "My Big Break is a board game about auditioning in musical theatre. Components of the game are pawns, dice, money, credits, bitter cards, closing cards, and the board pieces. The general idea is that players go on gigs and accumulate a resume in the form of credits so that they eventually are qualified and ready to audition for their 'Big Break'. Booking this gig wins the game.<br/> Player take turns. Each turn has four phases. The first is an income phase, where players earn credits and/or money (except when in NYC, where they have to pay to live there). The second phase is an audition phase where they roll dice to see if they are cast in a gig. The third phase is a movement phase. The last phase the players either can play a 'bitter card' or they 'take class'. Playing a bitter card generally has a detrimental effect on another player. Taking class involves exchanging money and other resources to gain special advanced credits.<br/><br/>Bitter cards are generally earned by failing to book auditions. Closing cards are earned by completing professional gigs. Specialty Credits are required to audition for more advanced gigs, such as Cruise Line and Bus 'N Truck. A player must possess all three specialty credits (acting, vocal, and dance) and must have 15 total credits or more to audition for their 'Big Break'. If a player fails this audition, he/she loses an advanced credit, a generic credit, and gains two bitter cards. Play continues until somebody books their 'Big Break'.<br/><br/>A future expansion of My Big Break is planned which will contain the option to work for a Theme Park and a Dinner Theatre. Players will also be able to wait tables in NYC and take an agent there.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "When your two choices are make laws, or go to prison, you&rsquo;ll scrape the bottom of the barrel to stay free.<br/><br/>ACHTUNG! is an abstract strategy game about creating a multitude of pointless laws and annoying rules for everyone in the game to follow.<br/><br/>As players draw and play cards, the number of laws continues to build until it becomes impossible for the average player to follow them all. When a player breaks a law, and someone else notices, they get called out by having ACHTUNG! shouted at them, and they must discard from their hand of cards. Once a player loses all of their cards, they&rsquo;re put in the gulag and must catch someone else breaking a law to re-enter the game. The game is over when a lone lawmaker remains.<br/><br/>The gameplay is separated into 5 distinct card types: Global Laws that everyone at the table must follow, Directed Laws that only effect a single player, Amendments that modify the text of cards already on the table, Filibusters that interrupt the main-game for a chance to win valuable cards, and Abolish cards that remove other cards from play.<br/><br/>ACHTUNG! is currently in its second edition. The second edition contains updates to the first edition rules and cards, such as allowing players to place markers on law cards to point out individual laws to play. Adjustments have also made to the Filibuster cards in the second edition to speed up gameplay.<br/><br/>",

You set up them like in classic memory, hiding pictures. Using a special application for mobile devices (Android or iOS), produced by publisher, you scan QR codes of two cards of your choice.

        "description": "Intended for families who enjoy strategy-based games, PaNiC STaTioNS is a card game suitable for 2 to 4 players age 8 to 80.<br/><br/>The cards are first set out in a square to form the playing area. Some of the cards are kept back to ensure that it is more difficult to predict what you will land on. The cards are initially face-down and Tokens are placed on the cards.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to collect 10 Tokens and then be the player who turns the last card face-up.<br/><br/>Each player has two Pawns which are moved around the cards according to the role of two dice. During the first phase of the game Tokens are collected when a player lands on the cards. The card is then turned face-up and any instructions followed. For example it could be a &quot;Booby-Trap&quot; card which forces your Pawn out of play. In which case you need to roll a 6 to bring it back in to play.<br/><br/>During the second phase of the game most of the Cards will have been turned-face up and most of the Tokens collected. It now becomes more important to keep both Pawns in play to give you some flexibility in choosing which cards you land on. You and your rivals will be trying to force Pawns out of play, trying to steal Tokens, and generally attempting to turn the last card face-up. The cards have various effects which assist (or hinder) you in this. Many of the cards interact with each other. For example if a rival's Pawn is on the &quot;Philanthropy&quot; card (which obliges him to give away 2 Tokens every time somebody else's Pawn goes out of play) it could be a good move to land on &quot;Maelstrom&quot; which forces all Pawns out of play. Most of the cards have effects that can be used to advantage in this way.<br/>Each turn you also have the option of rolling the &quot;Panic Die&quot; which gives you other alternatives. You may choose to do this, for example, if your initial dice roll was particularly disadvantageous of if another player is about to win. You do however have the chance of losing half your Tokens - but even this can be turned to your advantage if you realise how.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Wild West Exodus is a table top miniatures game set in a sci-fi filled 1800's America. Technology and greed rule the old west. Wild West Exodus: Unfinished Business introduces 4 new factions to the game; The Confederate Rebellion, Dark Nation, Golden Army, and The Watchers.<br/><br/>About The Watchers:<br/>As the portals once again open on earth, mankind has no idea what is coming.  The destructive power of the Watchers will completely strip the land of all living things.  The Watchers use their Alpha leaders to guide and advance their many species of aliens.  Each and every member of the Watchers knows his role in their society and follow orders without question.  As their enemies attempt to stop the Watchers, the Betas drain the life energy from their bodies and transport it to their Alpha leader.  This transforms the Alpha during the course of any battle into an enemy that knows every move you will make before you even make it.  With inhuman weapons and a thirst for human blood, they plan to wipe mankind off the planet once and for all.<br/><br/>About Wild West Exodus:<br/>Wild West Exodus is a miniatures game played by 2 to 4 players in control of the faction of their choice.  In the world of WWX, every model has the potential to be a hero or a villain.  The game mechanics and rule set feature exciting game play from the first dice roll.  Each player will be allowed to field a posse of 6 to 60 models or more.  The WWX rules have been designed to allow for scaling of the game to high or low model counts without causing rules issues.<br/><br/>One of the most exciting parts of the Wild West Exodus game mechanic is the reusable influence pool.  The influence pool will give players the option to gamble away a set amount of tokens in return for a reroll of the dice.  Be careful what you gamble on because once the tokens are committed they are lost for that turn.  The D10 system gives the game life and options that round out easily and allow for quick decision making.<br/><br/>The Halo that each model possesses creates an area of assault around the miniature allowing for fast and deadly close combat.  This helps move the game along quickly and gives each fight a more cinematic feel.<br/><br/>Wild West Exodus also benefits from an alternating 1-3 model activation system.  This system lets both players choose the most strategic way of advancing their characters across the battle field.  This means that you never have to wait more than a minute or two before taking control of your own posse for your next activation.<br/><br/>Each posse consists of a structured army list.  All factions will have 1 Boss model, 0 to 4 Underboss models, 0 to 8 Sidekick models, and an endless amount of Hired Hands.  Heavy and Light Support vehicles also make up an army list.<br/><br/>This really gives the gamer the option to field a force led by one mighty general commanding a horde of troops or the complete opposite.<br/><br/>Some gamers may choose to load up on skilled Sidekicks and Underbosses or go heavy on Hired Hands for a true horde army.<br/><br/>No matter what option you take, the world of Wild West Exodus will engulf you in fun and excitement from your very first game.<br/><br/>",

However, the pull on its people has consumed many of their warriors, and the Dark Council has influenced even the strongest of their leaders.  With the corruption spreading like a virus, the shape shifting Warrior Nation men and women become trapped in a half animal half human form left to walk the land as deformed creatures with no home.  Once these proud warriors leave the guiding light of the great spirit, they are doomed to a blood thirsty life of war.

        "description": "In the future, sooner than you&rsquo;d bet on&hellip;<br/><br/>As the world progressed towards the future, the wealthy elite one-percenters found themselves losing their passions.  Golf&rsquo;s formerly exclusive clubs were opened to the masses, horse racing was banned as cruel, and auto racing was found to be not &quot;carbon credit cost effective&quot;.  The elite needed a new pastime.<br/><br/>Fortunately for them, a new class of mass-spectacle gladiators was found. Questionable lab projects involving human-cloning, attempting to solve the world&rsquo;s worst diseases, created a global zombie pandemic.  Luckily, the crisis was put down quickly &ndash; but the lab-created undead still existed.<br/><br/>Someone with a bit of redneck, and way too much time, picked up a few up zombie &ldquo;assets&rdquo; at a company bankruptcy liquidation. After a little tinkering, he managed to build a control collar contraption. When a zombie was outfitted with a collar, a skillful operator could, sort-of, get the zombies to walk in a straight line.  Conveniently, the undead had no legal rights, which made them the perfect attraction.<br/><br/>A viral video and a crowd-sourced funding campaign later, these not-so-intelligent shamblers were being billed as the latest thing in racing spectacles.  Wealthy backers quickly formed teams, a league and championship cup was created, and the wealthy few who could afford the labs, zombie jockeys, and all that related to it now had a new prestigious exclusive club.<br/><br/>As with all good clubs, betting became part of the social fun.  As one could never really count on one&rsquo;s zombie to come through, betting for, or even against one&rsquo;s own entry into the race was not only allowed, it was encouraged!<br/><br/>While these new zombie drivers competed against each other for the series championship, the owners had their own prestige cup based on bets, side bets, crowd ratings and worse.<br/><br/>Bet on your friends zombie driver to make the podium &hellip; SURE!   Bet on your zombie to place third &hellip; WHY NOT? WIN when your zombie shambles over the line backwards &hellip; CHECK!<br/><br/>Welcome to the wacky, zany, risky but always crazy world of high stakes championship zombie racing!<br/><br/>In Twenty Yard Shamble, players are owners of racing zombies. They pit their zombie against the other zombies, in a series of 3 races, out of an arena where armed Hunters and helpless Victims prowl. Zombies move in a semi-controlled fashion based on dice rolls. The arena has 6 finish lines spaced equally around the outside edge. The first zombie to cross a finish line is first, and earns points for it's owner AND anyone who bet on it. The second zombie to cross gets second, and the third zombie gets third. After the third zombie crossed a line, the crowd gets bored, and all remaining zombies are shot and killed.<br/><br/>During a race, players place bets on any of the racing zombies, including their own. If a players zombie is not performing well, that player can place a bet on another player's zombie who is performing better, and may be able to help that zombie finish better in the race.<br/><br/>At the end of 3 races, the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

For example, a player may be an olympic athlete (job) whose hands keep getting stuck to the table (quirk).   Or, a doctor (job) who offers other players back-handed compliments (quirk).  Or, a dancing instructor (job) who is hitting on other players (quirk).<br/><br/>With inspiration from a random scenario, players role-play a discussion and provide clues to each other about what their two qualities (job/quirk) are.<br/><br/>There are no &quot;turns&quot; in this game.  Conversations are free-flowing discussions where players may ask and answer questions whenever appropriate.  Players drop creative hints about their identities through the use of verbal hints, including puns and keywords related to their jobs, hints to aspects of their jobs, and cultural references.  Players may also use physical gestures to help convey their identities.<br/><br/>Players earn the most points if they can signal what their jobs and quirks are to some -- but not all -- other players, and also earn points for guessing who other players are.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Welcome to Rogue Planet! A derelict world where you can experience true sci-fantasy gaming that allows you to fight skirmishes that focus on the cinematics and action of the genre without skimping on the tactics. It features:<br/><br/><br/>    ROGUE Die Mechanic<br/>    PAWN System<br/>    FX Phyisics Engine<br/>    Skill Based Combat<br/>    ENERGY Expenditure System<br/>    No labor intensive bookkeeping!<br/>    No measuring!<br/>    Custom point based force creation<br/>    Equipment and Upgrades<br/>    Sorcery and Psionics<br/>    Multiple game levels<br/>    Scenarios<br/><br/><br/>-Play Aids<br/><br/>INNOVATIVE SYSTEMS<br/>ROGUE DIE&trade; | The ROGUE DIE mechanic allows you to counteract your enemies&rsquo; actions during their turns and fuels your powered weapon, powered armor, and psionic force weapon abilities and effects. Counter-actions include things like: dodging, returning ranged fire, counter casting, and intercept maneuvers.<br/><br/>PAWN SYSTEM&trade; | The innovative PAWN system provides a unique mechanism for representing your leader&rsquo;s retinue and followers and makes for dynamically changing battles as your hero loses abilities, power, and support during a game. PAWNS are also a prime feature of the campaign system and allow a leader to gain new abilities, change strategies, and evolve as a adventure progresses.<br/><br/>Pawns include: ammo grunts, bots, expendables, familiars, intimidators, and brutes [and many more!]. Who will follow you into battle?<br/><br/>FX | The FX Physics Engine&trade; powers the epic throws, collisions, and staggering blows on ROGUE PLANET. It also gives players the option to make the battlefield more interactive with the implementation of destructible, throwable, and treacherous terrain types. Want to throw an orc in powered armor halfway across the battlefield into a group of goblins and see what survives? FX makes it happen!<br/><br/>ENERGY | The ENERGY expenditure system allows you to simulate the strength of your force, powers the various armor ratings of your troops, and gives you the option to keep your units in play when you want or need to- but there&rsquo;s always a cost!<br/><br/>STREAMLINED GAMEPLAY<br/>GOT SKILLS? | Actions on ROGUE PLANET are a measure of skill. You&rsquo;ll find no &lsquo;buckets-of-dice&rsquo; or straight-line probabilities here. The interactive skill check system means that all players are constantly involved in the game, and you&rsquo;ll need to work for the best possible tactical advantage or risk having your opponent counter you and take advantage of your failures.<br/><br/>NO BOOKKEEPING! | There are no hit point boxes, extensive tables, or detailed stat tracking on ROGUE PLANET&trade;. Not only that, but there are no chits, tokens, spell, psionic, or effect markers littering the table either. The focus is always on the miniatures, terrain, and action on the table.<br/><br/>MEASUREMENT? | There are no measuring sticks, grids, rulers, centimeters, or inches used for the game. Measurements are based on the relative position of units, line-of-sight [LOS], terrain, and the in-game FX Physics Engine&trade;.<br/><br/>CREATE WHAT YOU WANT<br/>CUSTOM FORCE CREATION | Point based unit creation system gives you total control to bring your force to the tabletop in the way you envision it.<br/><br/>EQUIPMENT AND UPGRADES | There are over 30 different types of base weapons, armor ratings, and enhancements in the game that be used by themselves to equip your troops or combined with one another to create almost limitless supply of custom combi-weapons. These upgrades include: axes, blades, lances, blasters, heavy launchers, powered armor, powered fists, gravity hammers, chained blades, psionic force weapons, and grenades.<br/><br/>SORCERERS AND PSYCHERS | What sci-fantasy world would be complete without the inclusion of sorcerers and psychers. Heroes on ROGUE PLANET can be either [or both!] and wield powers like: psionic throw, anchor, time stop, magic missile, blink, deflection, and more. May the psionic force be with you space wizard- always.<br/><br/>PLAY HOW YOU WANT<br/>GAME TYPES | There are multiple levels of play that allow players with various collection sizes and gameplay preferences to enjoy the game and have it grow with them. Patrols, Strikes, Missions, and Extended Ops ensure that there&rsquo;s always a new way to experience adventures and combat on this derelict world. For example, during Extended Ops, your heroes may not only gain new followers but just might gain [or become] a nemesis.<br/><br/>SCENARIOS | The included scenarios range from simple battles to ambushes and there are also options for unique modes-of-play featuring ROGUE elements.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Great War is now just a distant memory in the minds of all but the eldest among us. Battles led to the splintering of the people living around The Shining City while one faction remained: the Hazimin. The Hazimin have done what they can to keep their still-glistening tower standing tall. However, though their monumental home in the center of the city is still impressive, their numbers are few. Even as new generations grow to power, the ruins of Dubai are at the heart of all conflicts among the factions of the wasteland. With the ruins still standing as a beacon of what once was &mdash; and a promise of what could be again &mdash; the new leaders of each faction (the Hazimin, the Bahriyyin, the Tayyarin, and the New Badu) have decided it is time to reclaim the city and become the leaders of Dubai.<br/><br/>Power over the city will be decided by the people, and only with that power can one faction establish their dominance. As your faction's leader, it is up to you to turn the ruins of the diamond of the desert into a new home for the people &mdash; but your control must outreach that of other factions to ensure that you rebuild the ruins in your image and rule the reformed city of Dubai!<br/><br/>Dubai: Rebuild the Ruins combines a unique thematic flavor with worker placement, tile-laying, and resource management elements in a game set in 2299 for 2-4 players. By using roundels for worker placement, players are constantly engaged in the game with little downtime as turn order is always changing. This allows for multiple player interactions as one player's turn often involves reactions from other players. The setting is additionally unique, but draws closely from the buildings of the modern day city of Dubai. In the end, the faction that has rebuilt the most of the city rules Dubai!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This was a project borne out of nostalgia for the photographs from the old Wargames World and Wargames Illustrated as well stories from various expatriate wargamers who moved to Australia and re-told great stories about fighting the Mahdi with Peter Gilder at the Wargames Holiday Centre.<br/><br/>After gathering information, sheets, original source tables and other files, the rules have been put together as close to the Gilder style of game as possible.<br/><br/>The Umpire plays the part of the Mahdists and their entry, troop type, disposition and general attitude is determined by the situation and random dice.  The events cards play the part of creating an additional element of the unknown into every game so that the same scenario can only rarely ever play the same way twice.  Mahdists are on larger style crafted bases for ease of movement and each base represents 100 men (scale of 1:10) even though there could be as few as 5 figures on a base if desired.<br/><br/>The Imperials are all played by the gamers.  &quot;Us&quot; against the Umpire is great fun!<br/><br/>This is also the perfect game for Solo play.<br/><br/>Organisation is based on five companies to a regiment each company consisting of 12 figures.  Once again, you can use 12 or as few figures as you wish as figures are never removed from bases but marked off on an easy to use Roster sheet.<br/><br/>Cavalry work in squadrons and Troops and artillery batteries in sections up.<br/><br/>The game comes with a 44 page gloss laminated booklet and a deck of random event cards. Six blank cards are included so players can tailor events and circumstances to suit your their collections and gaming dispositions.<br/><br/>",

All the great Heroes of Neverland have disappeared, and four Pirates from the Mainland have taken over. While J. M.

        "description": "Setting: The Year is 2078. The world has changed and will not return to it&rsquo;s previous state. In 2052 Umbratech, the first major corporation to rise from the ashes of the ecological wars of the mid 40&rsquo;s grew in power and ambition. With their invention of the world&rsquo;s first Planetary Core Reactor, located on the undersea Mid-Atlantic Ridge, it was hoped that the world would never again rely on non-renewable sources of energy. However, things did not go as planned. With no knowledge of the deepest crusts scientists blindly drilled to reach the intense heat of the Earth&rsquo;s Core, relying on theoretical data on the makeup of the Earth&rsquo;s layers. They were wrong, and a rapid reactor failure ensued, allowing the Earth&rsquo;s mantle to bleed through the crust. Massive continental shift occurred, along with earthquakes and a total disruption of oceanic ecosystems. A new continent emerged from the ridge, born in a matter of months. Midatlantia, as it was called, was both rich in resources and hotly contested. New ocean currents, melted icecaps, and the worldwide destruction of cities launched a new era on the Earth as world powers fought bitterly for the new and old land alike.<br/><br/>This war was known as the Mid-Atlantic War. By 2057 the war was over, and an alliance of the warring states had been formed to share the land. However, shortly after colonization the Mid-Atlantic Alliance ceded from their mother nations and declared independence, causing worldwide uproar. The troubles of creating a new nation were soon soothed by the vast wealth of Midatlantia, and the world was quickly ready to begin trade despite misgivings about the legitimacy of such a nation.<br/><br/>In 2064, the world&rsquo;s first, large scale underwater research station was created under the mantle of international cooperation. Recognizing that the ocean held untold secrets which would ultimately benefit mankind, the major nations of the world came together to form the International Maritime Collective. Together, they created the International Oceanic Observatory and Research Facility, often referred to as &ldquo;The Dome&rdquo;. This underwater facility was built on the floor of the Mariana trench in the Atlantic Ocean, thousands of feet beneath the surface. It has now been operational for fourteen years. Numerous scientific advances have been achieved through its research and thousands of new species have been cataloged and studied, resulting in cures for many diseases and new technologies that improve the lives of people everywhere. But rumour has it that scientists aboard the station have been conducting unauthorized research as well.<br/><br/>Overview: Fathoms is a cooperative adventure game with miniatures in which a group of players fight against hordes of undersea monsters controlled by a game master. Gameplay is designed to pit players against a changing environment as monsters swarm and water pours through hull breaches. Players advance their characters skills and armament by gaining experience. The game can be played in campaign mode in which a series of missions unfold a storyline, or as one-shot scenarios.<br/><br/>Gameplay: Fathoms begins by one player assuming the role of the Fathom Master, while the others pick from a selection of characters. Both the Fathom Master and the other players earn experience points. Players use it advance their character in skills that benefit either themselves or the whole team and to buy equipment. The Fathom Master uses it to unleash increasing terrors upon the players, such as more monsters or events like hull breaches. Players gain experience when they explore, kill monsters or use computer terminals to perform various tasks. This experience may be used between missions or at equipment lockers. The Fathom Master gains experience by damaging players and may spend it on his turn.<br/><br/>The game board functions as a grid and the line of sight rules are relatively simple. Each player receives two actions which may be divided any way they choose. In any order or repetition a player may move, attack or use an item/door/skill. Turn order is determined by rolling for initiative. Each player has 1 miniature which they maneuver through the rooms on the game board. When new rooms are opened, the Fathom Master places units depending on the number of players he opposes. Some of those units are predetermined while other may be bought with experience to add variability. Each round the Fathom Master follows the mission guide to keep the game evolving.<br/><br/>Modes of Play:<br/>Fathoms offers two modes of play: Campaign mode and Scenarios<br/><br/>There are 7 missions in Campaign mode, all of which are meant to be played sequentially as the story unfolds. Scenarios are one-shot missions that represent possible scenarios that could have occurred over the course of the storyline.<br/><br/>Game End: The game ends when players complete either the Campaign storyline or a one-shot Scenario. The game also ends if all Players are killed during a mission. Players that don't work well with others die, quickly.<br/><br/>Unique Elements: What makes Fathoms different than other adventure games is its use of water as an important game element. As the players progress through the game they encounter pools of water and hull breaches that will flood the map room by room. One simple rule guides the flow of water from room to room, making it simple to work with and compelling in the way it changes the battlefield. In water, weapons may become stronger or weaker, some skills may cease to be effective, and monsters grow stronger and more formidable.<br/><br/>Fathoms also has high-ground, which can give tactical advantage whether a room is dry or flooding with water.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You and your friends are tired of having all your great stuff go missing. You know it's that creepy house on the corner, and you have had enough. You are each going to gather a group of friends from the neighborhood and make a mad dash into the house to try to get your items back.<br/><br/>To start The Kids vs. The House, players determine how many items &mdash; as few as one and up to twenty &mdash; they need to recover from the house. This allows them to customize the length of their game.<br/><br/>You then flip the fist item card over and see how many kid team points you need to have to try to get the item back.<br/><br/>Each player starts with two cards from the Action/Kid deck. This deck contains kids from the neighborhood worth 1-5 points each that you add to your hand to try to build up a team with enough points to retrieve the item. There are also four other types of cards that cause things, do things, and help protect you from the creepy things that can happen in the house:<br/><br/><br/>     Chaos cards always go off when drawn. Chaos she is a harsh mistress.<br/>     Protection cards are used to prevent or deflect many of the negative events and actions in the game.<br/>     Incident cards can be played on other players during your action phase to try to disrupt their chances of acquiring the item.<br/>     Trap cards always go off when drawn, with the house apparently trying to defend its ill-gotten gains. Beware the house!<br/><br/><br/>During your turn, you draw a card from the Action/Kid deck. If it doesn't instruct you to play it immediately (traps and chaos cards), then you can put it in your hand. You then have the option to perform an action. If you have a card that is playable (Incident and some Chaos), you can play this on the other players to help yourself or hurt their chances to win.<br/><br/>Turns proceed around the play area until someone has at least as many points in their hand as shown as the target number on the item. Once that minimum is met, they can choose to fold their hand and place it face down. They now cannot be targeted by any incidents, but can be affected by Chaos and Trap cards.<br/><br/>Once a person folds, everyone yet to play in that round draws one card, then everyone reveals their cards to see who has the most points and clams the item.<br/><br/>If this wasn't the final item, shuffle the cards and repeat with the next item. When the final item is claimed, the person with the most points at the end wins.<br/><br/>---<br/>We currently are planning a Kickstarter launch in August 2016<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Piat Gin is a card drafting game with Rummy-like scoring at the end. Players are dealt 6 cards. They keep one, placing face-down in front of them, and then pass two from their hand face-up to the player on their left. This is repeated, keeping one passing two, until they only have three cards left in their hand. During this last hand (you'll have three cards) you'll keep one and only pass one. Once finished players will keep both of these cards to finish their set of cards. All players reveal their hands and begin scoring. The highest scoring hand wins and receives bonus points. Play to a set score, usually 100 points.<br/><br/>Piat Gin is the next game in the series of &quot;alien card games&quot;, Konog being the first. Games designed around the premise of a fictional alien race and how they might go about making a game that reflects their culture, biology, ideologies and other aspects of the species. These games are imported and introduced to those of us living in the Core Systems by the explorers and pioneers returning from the frontiers.<br/><br/>The Camenni are a long-lived species, known for extreme patience and sudden bursts of well-coordinated action. Piat Gin is a simple past time, different from the more complex time-consuming games that the elders might take part in (games similar to Chess or Go in which single turns can take years or decades to accomplish). This is not a game that possesses lavish details or ornate components. Piat Gin is carried by Camenni adventurers due to its small size or used to teach children patience and to practice the observation of subtle interactions of others.<br/><br/>The card faces and their features are intentionally kept simple, possessing no complex Camenni script, only differing amounts of circles, triangles, or rhombus (3 suits, numbered 1-6). This is so the game can be taught to most any species that might be encountered (please note that this deck is not resistant to mucus, salivation, persperation, or extremely high body temperatures like standard &quot;outrider&quot; decks). Camenni will drag a game of Piat Gin on for hours and even days when playing with each other. Of course, we don't have that luxury and play a round in a few minutes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "All Are Brothers: Solferino, 1859 simulates the decisive battle of the Second Italian War of Independence at the Brigade-level, with some additional Regimental-size and smaller detachments included. National and corps-level leaders are represented, on a map at 500 meters per hex, with 1-hour turns. Five scenarios are included: three that separately cover the north, central, and southern sectors of the battle, as well as a combined full battle scenario, along with a small introductory scneario. The combined scenario is suitable for up to four players (France, Sardinia-Piedmont, Austrian 1st Army, and Austrian 2nd Army).<br/><br/>The battle itself was a grinding slugfest often described as a &quot;soldier's battle&quot; - a deliberate slight to the often uninspired leadership of the generals and a tribute to an allied victory gained only at the tip of the bayonet. Villagers in the surrounding region would do their best in the days after to treat the myriad wounded, and answer as to why Austrians, Hungarians, Czechs, Serbs, and Slovaks were treated as well as the Italians: &quot;Tutti fratelli&quot; (All are brothers). The battle pits two Austrian armies against the combined forces of France and Sardinia-Piedmont, and features the full panoply of colorful period units - Jagers and Grenzers, massed cavalry divisions of all types, Bersaglieri, French Imperial Guard, and the French African Zouaves and Turcos. Advances in infantry and artillery firepower would soon make the tactics of the time obsolete, and the carnage at Solferino reflected the start of this paradigm shift, soon to be highlighted bloodily by the Austro-Prussian and Franco-Prussian wars.<br/><br/>This treatment of Solferino features an adaptation of Hermann Luttmann&rsquo;s Blind Swords system (At Any Cost, Hammerin' Sickles, Stonewall's Sword) as the core ruleset. The system is heavy on unpredictability and fog of war due to the chit pull mechanic. The chit pull mechanic also very much aids in solitaire play, as does variable activation rules and reinforcement tables. A number of other features help make face-to-face play attractive, including  a number of scenario variants and optional rules, a free-setup full battle scenario, and the move-and-countermove of event chit play. Nation-specific event chits also inject some period flavor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Strategic Decision: World War II covers the entire Second World War, from Poland to Nagasaki, from the Panama Canal to Bombay to Archangelsk to New York. High Strategic level gaming at the Army/Army Group level, and with unit production. No dice, no cards, nothing random used - you've only got yourself to blame if you lose! Two joined vinyl water-resistant maps: the Pacific (~21&quot; x 14&quot;) and European/African/MidEast (~27&quot; x 20&quot;) theatres are included.<br/><br/>For 2-6 players, the belligerents include Germany, Britain, France, Italy, the Soviet Union, China, Japan, the USA and major neutrals such as Poland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Sweden and Spain. In the two-player game, it's the Axis (Germans, Italians, Japanese) against the Allies (USA, Britain, Soviets, France, China). There are three counter sheets of 88 5/8&quot; counters each representing the land, air, naval and logistical units, mostly at the Army/Army Group level (infantry, tank/panzer, mech, shock, guards, SS, etc), with specialty units such as marines and paratroops. Air units represent tactical attack aircraft and strategic aircraft, including heavy strategic aircraft (B-29) and even atomics. The naval forces are flotillas of fighting ships, carrier task forces, landing craft and convoys. Logistical units play a major role in the game - no supplies, no attacks.<br/><br/>Turns are quarterly, and proceed over two maps, one of Europe/North Africa/Middle East and one of Asia and the Pacific, with the US East Coast on the former and the West Coast on the latter. Units appear historically, but their entry can be altered when the players change historical invasion dates. There are many political rules that reflect the limits that the historical leaders faced.<br/><br/>As units are eliminated, they enter replacement pools and it is then up to the players to decide what branch gets priority in production: will the German player seek panzers for the Eastern Front, supplies for North Africa, or Tactical aircraft vs Britain? The allies can share resources up to a point, and lend lease may be all that keeps the Soviets from folding early.<br/><br/>Players are free to try alternate strategies. Should the Germans hit Turkey to open a back door to the Middle East, the Suez and Baku? Should the US hit Japan hard early, or put the emphasis on stopping Germany? Should Japan join Germany's crusade against bolshevism or put the emphasis on naval victories?<br/><br/>Weather is incredibly important, affecting every turn except Summer. Winter slows everything down - except the Soviets.<br/><br/>There are no dice in this game! Hitler didn't roll the dice, and neither did Stalin, Roosevelt, Hirohito, Mussolini or Churchill. They made decisions and lived with them. You'll do the same. There are no randomization of effects at all. Each of your actions determines your fate, as does your opponent's. There is no dice to bail you out or ruin your plans - you have only yourself and your opponent to blame for that!<br/><br/>Yet each game takes a different path. It is possible for Italy to be the last Axis player standing. It's possible for the Allies to knock Japan out a year early or liberate Eastern Europe without the Soviets. The Soviets might just take all of Europe. All of these outcomes happened in actual games. Each turn requires you to plan ahead, to anticipate enemy moves and your counter to them.<br/><br/>",

With one hundred and eighty tanks, the regiment was arrayed in spearhead formation with the first section moving forward on a wide front of one and one half miles by about a mile deep. At about 0715 hours, the call rang out in the headsets, &ldquo;Enemy armor, twelve o&rsquo;clock!&rdquo; A British lieutenant of the 8th Hussars also dryly noted enemy armor to his regimental HQ by radio. &ldquo;It looks as if Jerry&rsquo;s come with a Panzer brigade,&rdquo; only to correct himself moments later. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s more than a brigade, its the whole bloody Afrika Korps. Alert! Alert!&rdquo;<br/><br/>And thus began the historic Battle of Gazala. It was May of 1942, Hitler&rsquo;s armies were still the masters of Europe, with more conquests to come. And yet YOU, tactical-level gamer and ATS devotee ... has only experienced this battle in &lsquo;penny packets&rsquo;, a tank here, two tanks there. Until NOW. Because the ATS GAZALA MONSTER is here to rescue you from never being able to cross off, &lsquo;big, real Western Desert warfare experience&rsquo; ... from your bucket list. Imagine the old Tobruk orders-of-battle ... with all of their one-to-one representations ... then knife forward with your formations of 10, no 15, wait add in Troop Leaders and panzer leaders ... and make that 17 AFVs ... in a full-blown presentation that gives you ALL of the tanks, guns and men (i.e., all combat counters; just bring your ATS rulebook and markers) ... and the playing area to duke it out in.<br/><br/>The set also debuts the first collection of 11&rdquo; &times; 16&rdquo; folding DESERT GEO boards and a selection of overlays to go with them.<br/><br/>",

In Jinmenken Haunted School Escape Game, your character must move around the scary school board, all while being chased by a so-called Jinmenken, a dog with a human face that is a staple of Japanese urban legends. Collect three matching items that spring from the clock tower to various rooms in the school, and then escape back to the starting point. Whoever gets there first is the winner! Spin the clock tower face to see how many moves you can make each time. But the clock may tell you to move the Jinmenken, who has three different speeds! If he catches your character, it's game over for you! There are also numerous other tricks and secret gimmicks depending on where you land on the board. This is a great game for Japanese language-learners and fans of Japanese ghost stories.<br/><br/>",

It was extremely maneuverable and agile and matched the land-based aircraft it had to fight.<br/><br/>The M.5 was operated by five Italian maritime patrol squadrons as a fighter and convoy escort. By the end of World War I, these aircraft were flown by both United States Navy and United States Marine Corps airmen. The three versions of the airplane proposed include the model flown by the Italian pilot Domenico Arcidiacono, an American plane flown by Willis B. Haviland and a captured Austrian plane piloted by Friedrich Welker<br/><br/>Designed to be used with the popular air combat game system created by Andrea Angiolino and Pier Giorgio Paglia, each WW1 Wings of Glory Airplane Pack is a ready-to-play model, painted and assembled, 100% compatible with any other WW1 Wings of Glory game product. In each pack you will find all you need to play with the airplane: a special base with gaming stats, a variable altitude flying stand, and a specific deck of maneuver cards.<br/><br/>",

In the LCD tradition, they are perfect for those wanting a game that is fast to learn and quick to play. These games will include all new graphics, corrected errata, and consolidated rules.<br/><br/>Volume I features four of the most famous and significant battles from the First English Civil War (1642-1646) which saw  Royalist ('Cavalier') supporters of King Charles I against the Parliamentarian ('Roundhead') supporters of the Long Parliament.<br/><br/>Edgehill (1642): Charles marched on London intending to force a decisive battle with the main Parliamentarian army under the Earl of Essex.. They met  at Edgehill in the  first pitched battle of the war. Both armies were inexperienced and ill  disciplined, and many fled or simply set about looting the enemy baggage train. As a result the battle was inconclusive and the war would continue for another four years.<br/><br/>First Newbury (1643): Almost exactly a year later and we see Charles again facing the Earl of Essex. The Royalists had enjoyed a series of successes which had left the Parliamentarians in disarray. As Charles besieged the town of Gloucester, the Parliamentarians mustered a force under Essex and through surprise succeeded in breaking the siege. They then fell back towards London. The Royalist rallied and, overtaking the Parliamentarians, blocked the path to London at Newbury. A surprise dawn attack saw the battle initially going in Essex's favour. Royalist counter-attacks were bloody and Essex was at risk of being encircled but fought back and pushed forward again - only to be slowed by Royalist cavalry. The Parliamentarian force was split in two but the Royalists attempt to drive through and encircle the wings was unsuccessful. With night falling and both sides exhausted the battle drew to a close. Next day, short of ammunition, the Royalists were obliged to allow Essex to continue his march to London.<br/><br/>Marston Moor (1644): This was to be the largest battle of the Civil Wars and saw the Royalists under Prince Rupert and the Marquis of Newcastle facing a combined English Parliamentarian /Scottish Covenantor force under the Lord Fairfax,  the Earl of Manchester and the Earl of Leven. Rupert marched to break the siege of the Earl of Newcaste at York. The armies met outside York on Marston Moor but Rupert, who had sought battle, hesitated from attacking due to being outnumbered. Towards evening the Parliamentarian and and Covenantors took the initiative and launched a surprise attack. After two hours of fighting Cromwell routed the Royalist cavalry following which the Royalist infantry were annihilated.<br/><br/>Naseby (1645): Though the war would continue for another 18 months, Naseby was the decisive battle of the First English Civil War, seeing Charles' main army, led by the King and Prince Rupert, destroyed by the Parliamentarian New Model Army under Fairfax and Cromwell. The Royalists held a strong position on a ridge between two villages but left it when they saw Parliamentarian cavalry withdrawing. Having redeployed the Royalists attacked and the two centres were soon locked in melee. On the Parliamentarian left the two cavalry wings engaged. The Parliamentarian cavalry broke and the Royalists pursued. After an initial face off on the Parliamenraian right, the cavalry wings engaged and the Royalists were routed by Cromwell. Unlike the Royalists on the other wing, only part of Cromwell's horse went in pursuit, with the rest attacking the Royalist centre - at the same time as a smaller attack on the other flank. The King sought to assist his beleaguered centre by personally leading his lifeguard to the rescue but was restrained . Rupert eventually rallied the horse  attacking the Parliamentarian baggage and returned to the field - but too late.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Other than being colorful and fun, this game has no relation to the hit Pixar film. UP is a unique abstract game for 2-6 players that combines the strategy of limited actions, with the luck of dice, and the joy of building blocks. Games last about 30 minutes. Basically, you're all building one stack of multicolored dice and moving your pawns up the stack along paths of color that match your pawn.<br/><br/>You start out with a handful of dice. There's no numbers on these dice, just 6 different colors; and the dice themselves are different colors. You have to get rid of all your dice to win the game, but you also have to be the highest pawn on the stack after you've used up all your dice.<br/><br/>The color that you roll determines where a die can be placed on the stack (that's the luck part), but rather than spending a die, you can use your turn to move or rotate a die that's already on the stack (that's the strategy part). You might want to move a die to open up a path for your pawn to climb higher, or rotate a die to make it harder for an opponent.<br/><br/>The competition gets hotter as the game progresses, and there seems to be a good &quot;catch the leader&quot; dynamic, so that by the end, everyone is often at the edge of their seats to see if a lucky roll or a tricky maneuver will win the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/>Twisted is an immersive new tabletop skirmish game for 2 or more players, with a world-class range of 32mm miniatures representing your characters.<br/><br/>Set in an uniquely interesting steampunk universe, Twisted&rsquo;s absorbing gameplay and linked story-driven missions create a real emotional connection between you and your characters on the tabletop. Every character has an original backstory and distinctive role within the Twisted universe: guiding them through our richly-developed environments and exciting encounters will have you on the edge of your seat and wanting more!<br/><br/>But beware the power of the Engine! The ever-present influence of the mysterious steampunk Engine pervades the world of Twisted. What makes playing Twisted excitingly unique is that the Engine itself brings a new and intriguing element to every encounter: the Eye of the Engine card deck and the unique &lsquo;Favour of the Engine&rsquo; game mechanic give the Engine an active role in the actual gameplay.<br/><br/>Maintain the favour of the Engine to enjoy rich rewards, or tempt fate and risk it all!<br/><br/>The Engine is the hidden source of steampunk power permeating the world Twisted. But it is more than just a god-like machine: it has a selfish consciousness seeking to transform the world according to its own designs, and a jealous ego unwilling to share this power!<br/><br/>Rumours of the Engine&rsquo;s influence are spreading throughout the world of Twisted, and competing factions have emerged seeking to discover the secret access points to the Engine&rsquo;s power: the Nodes.<br/><br/>The first faction to stumble upon one of these Nodes is the Dickensians: their discovery of an Engine Node hidden deep beneath the darkest sewers of London triggers an explosion of raw steampunk power as the Engine &ndash; sensing danger &ndash; fights back by summoning the Servants of the Engine!<br/><br/>",

Still in the Wizard's Tower, they have to try to overcome all the defence mechanisms that are targetting them now as &quot;vermin&quot;. The final cure is outside of the Tower but only one of them can win. Be either clever or fast ... preferably both.<br/><br/>The game works with a modular board, where the different rooms of the wizard's Tower can be influenced and moved with different magic spells. While exploring the rooms for spells and wonderous items, the frogs have to avoid the guardians and traps of the tower... and sometimes even the rival apprentices, which are in the same Situation now too.<br/><br/>RanaDrama is a highly competative game where creative use of the numerous spells is the key.<br/><br/>At the start of every turn a Player has to determine by a dice roll, which persona (the one of the wizard's apprentice or the frog's) is dominant. Based on that, and modified by certain magical effects the movement Points are determined.<br/><br/>A Player can use theese Points to hop around on the room Cards, casting spells or searching their square on the room Card to find the key out of the Tower or other useful magical artefacts.<br/><br/>Only the Player with the Crystal key can pass the Guardian at the end of a floor, but all the other Players can hunt him down to get the key from him.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Rally On is a rally racing tabletop game that uses a risk and reward dice system to play out events during each rally stage.<br/><br/>Rally On has been a dream of mine for the last five years. I have always been an avid rally and all around race fan. I started to design a game based on what I wanted a table racing game to be and something that I had never played before. Once, I got together with Ben M, the game really started to pick up steam. He brought the same passion I had for making a fun and exciting table top rally game. When we decided to bring on randomly laid out stages every time you play, dice driven events and a driver confidence system really brought the project to life.<br/><br/>Playing a different track varies the game dramatically. Never again will you have to have to play the same board over and over again or are you forced to spend money to buy a new track, just to add variety. The confidence system allows the player to push their luck with a smaller risk of an event happening, but the catch is that you only have a limited number of confidence points to start the entire rally with. The points are also carried over stage to stage, so you have to be careful not to use all yours up at the beginning or you won't have any left for later stages. This really helps to determine how hard you want to attack a turn or how fast you want to push your driver. You also get penalties for running out of confidence, so that is always on your mind. There are various ways to regain confidence points and also many ways to lose them. During Event rolls you might gain more back by taking a turn perfectly or lose a point for botching it.  At the end of each Stage the players each get four driver points to spend to repair drivetrain or add confidence points. You can also use those to buy more Pace cards. Pace cards are various cards that the players can use to benefit themselves or play against their opponents. There are six, six sided dice that the players use to play out events throughout Rally On. Each die side has a unique symbol that corresponds to an event that could happen to player. Some are good and some are bad. Depending on how hard you are pushing your driver determines how many dice you will be rolling for the event. You could come out a head and gain a few extra movement spaces, shave some time off your current run, damage your car, lose time or wreck. Don't forget you always can use your precious confidence points to re-roll an event die if needed.<br/><br/>The goal of Rally On is to complete each stage of the rally with the least amount of time ticks. It is meant to be played as a three stage rally, but you can do less. At the start of each turn the player decides if they will up shift or downshift their gear. Once that is determined they roll the corresponding gear die. They then move that number of spaces on the stage. Each time the player comes up to a turn tile they have to decide which lane to take the turn in. Each lane has a maximum gear the player can enter in. The player has the option to attack the turn in the inside lane or outside lane. The inside lane is usually safer, but slower. The outside lane will be faster but adds a higher chance of rolling a bad event, due to rolling a higher number of event dice. This makes the outside lane a higher risk and you could potentially take damage, slide, spin off track, lose time or even gain confidence for a perfect turn. At the end of each stage the players tally their time. The player with the least amount of time wins that current stage.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher:<br/><br/>Race to the White House is a sophisticated two-player simulation of the upcoming presidential election. Its mechanics are board-and-card driven with some dice-influenced results; the game flow is controlled by action and reaction cards, dice rolling, hand management, and area influence. A quirky, humorous tone keeps the mood light, despite the deep gameplay.<br/><br/>The game takes place over the final eight weeks of the campaign and concludes with the assignment of electoral votes on Election Night. Each player chooses a candidate they are trying to propel to victory. Play as one of the leading lights of the 2016 campaign, or bring back a proven winner! Some candidates are better at speaking, some bring more skill at fundraising, some are from swing states, and others are simply rich.<br/><br/>Each week is divided into two turns, one for each player, and is affected by an environment card that may temporarily alter the cost or effect of your actions. You&rsquo;ll begin with five action cards, representing various things you can do during that week&rsquo;s campaign, such as uncover a scandal, criticize Cuba, collect an endorsement, or even start a war. You&rsquo;ll also start with five state cards, which determine where you can play your action cards. Each turn gives you the opportunity to draw or purchase new and more powerful action cards, some of which can be combined to extraordinary effect.<br/><br/>Each week you&rsquo;ll spend time and energy visiting swing states, building up influence points that hopefully will lead to winning that state on election night. If you build up enough influence, you&rsquo;ll get momentum in that state, which will make it harder for your opponent to come back&mdash;but be careful; spend too much time in any one place and they&rsquo;ll start to get sick of you.<br/><br/>Have you sold out to major donors to finance your campaign? Of course you have! This gives you money, which you can spend on state or national advertising. Again, this can give you momentum, but you risk overexposure.<br/><br/>You can do all sorts of things in Race to the White House by playing Action Cards. You can come out against the Keystone XL pipeline (if you&rsquo;re a Democrat) or promise more mining permits (if you&rsquo;re a Republican). If your party is in office, you can start a war, or respond to a major natural disaster&mdash;but be careful; either one can backfire badly, and your opponent might have an October Surprise ready. You can cheer for a swing state&rsquo;s baseball team in the World Series, or you can stick your opponent with bad weather. You can uncover a scandal in state government that puts a safe state in play, or you can send hecklers into your opponent&rsquo;s rallies that neutralizes their effects. It feels just as crazy, exciting, and dirty as an actual campaign!<br/><br/>Over the course of eight weeks, you&rsquo;ll build up a strong position in some swing states, and if you&rsquo;ve been smart about it, you&rsquo;ll have managed to play defense and prevent your opponent from doing the same. But you never really know, do you? When election night rolls around, you&rsquo;ll be on the edge of your seat waiting for the networks to call the states in the order that their polls close. Some states will be easy, but others will be too close to call, potentially until early in the morning. If you&rsquo;re behind, do you concede and save some victory points? Or do you hang on until the bitter end? It&rsquo;s all up to you&hellip; in Race to the White House!<br/><br/>",

As part of your training, you have been tasked with the navigation of the ship. Compete against your peers to see who can guide the ship on the best course.<br/><br/>In As Seen in the Sky, each player must use their skill to reveal stars and gain way to the vessel's destination. As you practice, you will gain skill and learn tricks to outwit your fellow midshipmen. Earn points while revealing stars and if you can, reveal your hidden constellations to give you a step up on the competition. There will be many challenges in your wake before this trip is over, with squalls and seas that will push your limits. Many can learn the trade, but only one of you can expect a promotion. Who will it be?<br/><br/>On your turn, the player will roll a die to see what the current sea conditions are. Then based on the sea state, the player can use talents they have acquired to manipulate tiles in the night sky, move talents around on their player board, lock visible star coordinates in the sky, gain skill for adding talents to their arsenal, or gain course points for getting your ship closer to its destination. Before handing the die to the next player, you can take one visible unlocked tile from the night sky and place it in their play area, paying the skill needed for the placement. The game ends when all the tiles in the sky have been revealed. Players then reveal their completed constellations to gain bonus course points and the player with the highest course points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

In the warm up version, players lay tiles (datasets) to match patterns on tool cards and negotiate with each other to exchange and open data. The first player to build ten points of tools wins. In the full version, players take on roles that change how they negotiate with each other, and their incentives to win.

It contains the base game and an expansion for younger players (7+) with different cards and rules, but using the same mechanism.<br/><br/>Optimo! is a fast-paced word game in which you have to be the quickest to find the best word with each round's setting. In each round, you have a combination of six cards with constraints (letter or lexical). These constraints can be a requirement (i.e. you must use the letter &quot;E&quot; or you must have six letters in the word) or a ban (i.e. you can't use verbs or you can't have a word with 4 or less letters). Then you must find a word that corresponds to at least 4 constraints, then trigger the timer to give the other players 30 seconds more to find a better word than yours. Pondering if you should find a 5(or 6)-constraint word or go fast with a 4-constraint word to get the fastest-player bonus but risk losing it all to a better word is the core mechanic of the game.<br/><br/>Optimo kids is an easy and fast-aced word game in which you have a combination of 4 cards with constraints (letter, lexical and theme) which can be requirements or bans. Players must find a word that fits the 4 constraints or launch a &quot;dare&quot; to the other players, leaving them 30 seconds to come up with a word or else, the &quot;darer&quot; wins the round.<br/><br/>",

It&rsquo;s also best played with a drink or two, but that&rsquo;s more up to you. ;-)<br/><br/><br/>     To begin, each player draws a unique Unfair Advantage card giving his business a super power of sort.<br/>     Players get 2 actions per turn. They can decide to build their business and attack their competitors.<br/>     As the business grows in market value, players must acquire Product, First Client and Marketing cards.<br/>     To win the game, a player must file for an IPO (and go public).<br/>     After announcing an IPO, things get really interesting... as the player needs to stay on top, fend off the competitors and avoid being undercut by another player going public. <br/>     The winner gets the bragging rights and gets to start the next game.<br/><br/><br/>",

But you know to become king of this city, you&rsquo;ll need a crew. Assemble the right team, complete heists, and gain notoriety. As you finish more jobs, the heat on you becomes stronger. If one of your squad gets pinched, you can always work the system with a bribe, or just let them go to the slammer. Outlast your rivals and see if you have what it takes to become the most NOTORIOUS.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/>As a new boss, you will complete small jobs by rolling dice. You&rsquo;ll use the earnings (jewels) from these small jobs to buy new members to join your crew. These Crew members will combine their abilities together to allow you to complete larger Heists. Every Heist you complete will earn you Notoriety points to win the game.<br/><br/>On your turn, you can do any 2 of the following:<br/>1.    Roll dice (completing small jobs)<br/>2.    Draft up to 2 crew cards<br/>3.    Complete up to 2 heists<br/><br/>Rolling Dice - If you roll dice, you roll your choice of 2 of the 3 colored dice (red, blue, and green), and roll 1 of the 2 black and white dice. You can keep and/or re-roll any of the dice once, so that&rsquo;s a total of 2 total rolls.<br/><br/>Dice representation: Blue die = Sapphires. Green die = Emeralds. Red die = Rubies. The diamond shape represents a Diamond. The Flame shape represents Surveillance. The Star on the Black die represents the player earning a Jewel of the player&rsquo;s choice.<br/><br/>Drafting Crew Cards &ndash; The cost of the Crew Card is detailed in the upper left portion of the card. You can pay the jewel cost (earned from rolling dice), and that crew member is now part of your crew. You will play that Crew Card on the table in front of you. A new Crew Card replaces the drafted Crew Card on the table. - Each crew member has attributes which will help players complete Heists. Some crew members have special abilities which will improve your abilities, or hinder the play of your competitors.<br/><br/>Completing Heists &ndash; If you have enough attributes from your collective Crew Cards, you may complete the Heists. The Heist requirements are detailed at the bottom of the Heist Card. You will add your Crew Card attributes together, and if those attributes total to at least the minimum required for each Heist requirement, you may complete the Heist. You will take the Heist card and keep it on the table in front of you. A new Heist Card is placed face up on the table to replace any Heist Card taken by a player. Each Heist Card has a Notoriety point value at the top right. The first player to earn at least 21 Notoriety points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

To achieve this, players have 330 cards between units, supports and locations in order to build their own forces deck to use in battle against opponents, in the locations determined by each player. EverZone introduces a revolutionary game mechanism to minimize random elements, creating extremely tactical challenges.<br/><br/>EverZone: Colony Assault is not a mere expansion of a game already published some time ago, but it's a sort of EverZone 2.0.<br/>In this new game you will have:<br/><br/>     A new and more complete rulebook,<br/>     330 brand new cards with balanced and refined powers to give you a more exciting gaming experience.<br/>     A stand alone box, so that you won't necessarily need the basic game to play EverZone, but you can combine both of them to have wider strategies.<br/><br/><br/>Besides, a third kind of card will be introduced: the structures.<br/><br/>Structures are paid by your own command points (or life points) and remain in the battlefield with permanent powers for your army until they are destroyed by opposing attacks.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "PM Galaxy is a board game that has been developed as a tool to facilitate the learning of project management concepts in a fun and engaging way. It is intended for project management trainers and consultants, project managers, project team leaders and team members. Basically, for all those involved in projects who want to improve their project management knowledge while having a great time together with their team! The Game is available (for now) in English and Romanian languages.<br/><br/>It is a collaborative and competitive board game for 3 to 5 players, where each player, alias &bdquo;project manager&rdquo;, takes control of a distinctive project. Although each project manager fights to be the first one to complete his or her project, these projects are interdependent and share, as it always happens, limited resources. The task of each project manager is to guide their projects through its phases, gathering resources by answering quizzes and investing those resources to overcome challenges.<br/><br/>We built PM Galaxy to cover both the fun part (the secret ingredient to building a team) and the educational part as well. It can be anything you want &ndash; a board game to play with your team, a learning tool, a training instrument, you name it. PM Galaxy is meant to help players learn and remember key concepts of project management and best practices in the field, by testing their knowledge and rewarding them for their efforts in a fun and engaging way.<br/><br/>We also have been using the game in our project management training sessions with great success. The participants love it and it adds a nice twist to the classic project management training. The game can be used throughout the whole training with debrief sessions or at the end as a Recap tool.<br/><br/>The goal of the game, which was developed based on the Project Management Institute standards, is to gather all necessary project documents and resources for your project, while also helping the project you depend on, in order to win. Or you could just look after yourself and hope for the best or sabotage the other players, but we strongly advise against it. From our experience so far this approach didn&rsquo;t prove fruitful, neither in the PM Galaxy nor in real life :)<br/><br/>",

Nobody knew the origin of that game but, Martin, a fan of any table game even if it seems boring, convinced everyone to play it. When they opened the board, all fo them were absorbed by an obscure portal that transported them to the Nitram's Dimension. This strange place seems to be related to Martin, however nothing is what it seems. The only thing they have in mind is that to return they must find a portal similar to the one that brought them. Here there are no friends, only rivals trying to escape this dangerous dimension.<br/><br/>During the game, the players roll the dices, advance in the map, find items &amp; events, fight against monsters &amp; Nitrams, and travel through other portals.<br/><br/>",

As Europe emerges from the worst winter in living memory the Soviet war machine is replenished and ready for action. 1946 was not the greatest year for The Motherland, although the German invaders were repulsed in their efforts to invade.

        "description": "Black Metal is a solitaire adventure game that is set in a dark wintry realm. The player oversees several game characters as they fulfill missions in this challenging environment. These characters represent a declining pagan population that is caught between the New Religion and the spiteful counter-religion known as the Growing Evil. This latter division includes ruffians, malicious necromancers, the infamous NecroFiend occultists, and demons from foul depths.<br/><br/>The game is divided into 3 stages to represent the different missions to be undertaken. Each mission/stage involves coping with the New Religion in some way. In the first stage you seek to undo damage created by the New Religion. In the second stage you must impede the New Religion. And finally the third stage requires that you directly confront the New Religion.<br/><br/>GAME-PLAY:<br/>Player guided characters will travel on a map that is generated by land tiles. These tiles are drawn and placed as the characters move from turn to turn. At the same time, game controlled characters known as NecroFiends will be spawned; eventually traveling the tile map through an automated movement system. When player characters run into a NecroFiend, conflict is likely to occur.<br/><br/>In addition to NecroFiends, opposition can emerge through the Occurrence deck (from entering a tile) or through the Demon deck (upon exiting a tile). These encounters gnaw away at a character's vital resource --their followers. Followers are represented by purple cubes. When a game character (aka Leader) takes losses due to conflict, some or all of their followers are removed. A lack of followers makes a character extremely vulnerable and will often lead to elimination from the game if more followers cannot be acquired soon.<br/><br/>Combat in the world of Black Metal is resolved through two means, Brute Conflict and DarkArts Conflict. The former combat type is associated with physical conflict and uses a Combat Results Table involving up to three 4-sided dice. The latter combat type is associated with sorcery and uses a simpler system involving the combatants INSIGHT ratings and a single 4-sided die.<br/><br/>OBJECT:<br/>The player aims to fulfill at least one mission during the game. The game offers the opportunity to perform up to three missions. Missions are drawn from a deck and will describe locations that must be visited, along with actions that must be performed at these locations. Actions often include a special die roll procedure to solidify the outcome. The third mission will always involve conflict (using the game's conflict resolution system).<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME:<br/>To win Black Metal a player must fulfill every mission that is embarked upon. There are 3 levels of success --one for each mission that you accomplish. The game is lost if all player characters perish during the performance of a mission, regardless of how many missions have been completed. The earned titles of success are as follows:<br/><br/>1 Mission Fulfilled  = Hero Status<br/>2 Missions Fulfilled  = Liberator Status<br/>3 Missions Fulfilled  = Legend Status<br/><br/>Without losing, you may end a game after any mission (but before another has begun).<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to be the first player to gather seven cards of the same color, red, green or blue. Cards are accumulated through victories in any of the three games, Patter, Peril or Pointz.<br/><br/>Before each turn, players submit their Player Cards, face-down. Then the current player flips over the top card of the Draw Deck, the House Card, revealing the game for that turn.<br/><br/>If the game is Patter, the current player has but a few seconds, counted down by their opponents, to create a word from the letters on the revealed cards. They win the cards from whatever word they make.<br/><br/>If the game is Peril, the current player pits the Battle Icon on their Player Card against the icon on their opponent's card. If more than one opponent challenges, the player conducts Semifinals until only one challenger remains. The winner receives the Peril Prize, either two or three cards.<br/><br/>If they game is Pointz, the current player uses their finger to move along the board game squares on the bottom of the Player Cards. If they land on a pointing challenge, they have but a few seconds, again counted down by opponents, to point at the indicated item.<br/><br/>The first player to gather seven cards of the same color in their bank wins the game and is held in awe by the other players.<br/><br/>",

It's played on the intersections (points) of an initially empty square board. Both players must have access to a sufficient number of stones in two colors and a sufficient number of vertical and horizontal markers.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.<br/><br/>A group is a maximal set of orthogonally connected, like-colored stones.<br/><br/>A liberty of a group is an empty point adjacent to it.<br/><br/>A hole is an empty point such that all points adjacent to it are occupied by stones of the same color.<br/><br/>To claim a group is to place a marker of yours on top of one of its stones.<br/><br/>The four orthogonal adjacencies of a point are named after the cardinal points. Vertical owns the north and south adjacencies, the pairs north-south, north-east and south-west and the triplets north-south-east and north-south-west; Horizontal owns the east and west adjacencies, the pairs east-west, north-west and south-east and the triplets east-west-north and east-west-south.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayVertical plays first, then turns alternate. On their turn, a player must place one stone of any color on an empty point without creating any holes. Then, each unclaimed group without liberties is claimed by the player who owns the set of adjacencies of stones in that group to the stone just placed.<br/><br/>The game ends when the board is full. A player's score is the total number of stones on the board in groups that they have claimed, plus a komi in the case of Horizontal. The player with the highest score wins.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tKomiThe komi is the number of points which is added to Horizontal's score at the end of the game as a compensation for playing second. Before the game starts, the first player chooses the value of komi, and then the second player chooses sides. To avoid ties, the parity of komi should be different from the parity of the board size.<br/><br/>",

Players take turns either placing or moving one of their own pieces on the board, following the rules below:<br/><br/>1) When you place a new piece, it must be placed on an empty space, but you can choose whether to place it +side-up or &times;-side-up.<br/>2) When you move a piece, + moves orthogonally, and &times; moves diagonally, as the lines suggest. Move your piece any distance to an empty space.<br/>3) Pieces can jump over other pieces as long as the destination space is empty.<br/>4) After you move your piece, you must flip it over (+ becomes &times;; &times; becomes +).<br/>5) You are welcome to move your pieces before all of you pieces are on the board. <br/>6) Passing is not allowed.<br/><br/>",

Each card denomination includes a quick physical exercise, and players compete to make a match and force their opponents to do the activity.<br/><br/>In addition to exercises, each card includes an animal or a creature so that younger children, and those with limited mobility can participate by mimicking the shown creature when a match is made.<br/><br/>Go Fish Fitness is based around the same set of cards as a standard deck, and can be incorporated into many other standard card games as well. Keeping fit is about incorporating exercise into everyday life, in ways both big and small, and Go Fish Fitness is a way to introduce a little bit more exercise into a normally passive activity for your kids!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Berd is a new abstract strategy game for two players. The goal of the game is to collect more tokens than your opponent. Players collect token(s) when crossing the board starting from their base line and finishing - passing opponent&rsquo;s baseline. On their path to finish players can capture opponent&rsquo;s token(s)<br/>Some definitions: <br/>1. Tower &ndash; is a stack of two or more tokens; <br/>2. Berd is a tower with two or more same color tokens on the top; <br/>3.Unprotected tower or unprotected token (UT) &ndash; a single token or a tower that is not Berd. Unprotected tower moves like a single token. <br/>4. Recovering a captured token &ndash; player can recover the captured token by landing on UT and by restacking the tower create a Berd.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game players arrange their tokens on their baseline (the first row from player&rsquo;s side) in any combination. Players move their UT (unprotected token or Unprotected tower) one square at a time forward or side. You can&rsquo;t move your UT diagonally or backward. While you can move your UT laterally however you can&rsquo;t do more than three consecutive side moves. Players can capture opponent&rsquo;s token by landing on a square occupied by a single token or unprotected tower. You can&rsquo;t capture or land on a square occupied by your opponent&rsquo;s Berd. A player can recover his/her captured token from opponent&rsquo;s unprotected tower by landing on that tower. In this case the player will restack tokens and place his/her tokens on the top creating a Berd. In order to play a token from the Berd you have to split the Berd and play a single token or unprotected tower. If there are captured opponent&rsquo;s tokens in the Berd they must be attached at least under one of your token; -so basically you move UT from your Berd. The game is over when only one player has active token(s) left on the board.  Now players can stack their collected tokens and see whose tower is taller or who collected more tokens.<br/><br/>Variations of the game:<br/>1. Berd strategy game can be played on different size boards (3x3; 4x4; 5x5; 6x6) and/or with various number of tokens. Two sided board supplied in this game with 3x3 and 4x4 sides. Recommended to play with 5 tokens per each player on 3x3 and max 6 tokens on 4x4 board. <br/>2. Game with color protection &ndash; Players can use colored squares on the board for protection from being captured by the opponent&rsquo;s token. For example: Red color player&rsquo;s UT (single token or unprotected tower) will be protected on the Red square. Other rules are identical to the basic Berd game.<br/>3. Game with points &ndash; in this game each token assigned different weight/points (10; 20; 30; 40; 50 ..), shown on the token. This option of the game provides more possibilities for moves. The winner will be a player who collects higher total score. In order to play this version of the game you need to attach stickers with numbers. There are lines on the sides of the token for even attachment.<br/>4. Game with hidden points &ndash; games #1; 2 and 3 can be played with tokens that have hidden numbers (numbers are not displayed outside, they are attached inside). This game is similar to game #3 with the difference that only a player who possesses a token can see the weight of that token. This feature introduces more intrigue and uncertainty about the end result of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Masterwork<br/>A beautiful game of creating prestigious artworks<br/><br/>In Masterwork, players are artists struggling to win prestige by creating famous artworks and participating in gallery exhibitions. Collect pigments to craft brilliant paints and use those paints to paint the greatest artworks of the High Renaissance. Get critiqued, build your portfolio, and exhibit your work to become the most prestigious artist of the period!<br/><br/><br/>It's your turn<br/>On your turn, if you haven&rsquo;t started an artwork, you may select one from the gallery and move it to your easel, indicating that artwork is in progress. Now, only you can complete it. Next, use sets of pigments from your hand to produce paint, discarding the requisite cards indicated in the recipe area on the paint card. Move your new paint from the palette to your hand or place it on your easel, dedicating it to that artwork.<br/><br/>Each artwork requires a specific set of paints. When you have gathered them, in hand or on the easel, it&rsquo;s time to submit your artwork for a critique. Roll the critique die; if the value of equal or higher to the prestige value of the artwork, you have successfully completed it! Move the artwork, along with all paints used to complete it, to the table, clearing your easel for your next artwork. If your roll came up short, take a feedback token indicating you&rsquo;ve received useful advice from the critique. This token makes future critique attempts easier. Each subsequent artwork makes future critiques easier, representing the artist&rsquo;s growing popularity.<br/><br/>All 24 artwork cards award prestige points, with addition prestige earned by participating in exhibitions. Exhibits award prestige points when players complete sets of artwork cards; such as: &lsquo;Leonardo Exhibit&rsquo; (two artworks from Leonardo da Vinci) and &lsquo;Portrait Exhibit&rsquo; (artworks featuring portrait images). Masterwork includes 16 exhibit cards, with a random set of three used each game, offering a great deal of replayability.<br/><br/><br/>Mixing colors<br/>Pairs of primary color (Red, Yellow, Blue) cards may mix to be played as a secondary card of the same type. Secondary colors (Orange, Green, Violet) and different card types (Pigment and Paint cards) do not mix. Mixing colors gives you creative options when producing Pigment and Paint cards. Remember: you must always mix the same type (Paint with Paint, etc.)<br/><br/><br/>Ending and scoring<br/>When a player completes a gold-edged Masterwork Artwork card, finish the current round so each player has an equal number of turns (the player to the right of the starting player gets the final play). Each player adds up the Prestige Points from their completed Artwork cards. The three Exhibit cards are evaluated one after another for each player, comparing their completed Artwork cards with the requirements of cards. For each completed Exhibit card, add the indicated Prestige Point value to the Player&rsquo;s total. The player with the most Prestige Points wins!<br/><br/>",

You start your turn by drawing 2 playing cards and playing as many cards as you can or want without playing the same card twice. Once you are satisfied or cannot play anymore, you pass the turn to the next player.<br/>Remember, even though you need to destroy your opponent's Landmarks to win, playing all your cards every turn makes you an easy target!<br/><br/>To help you eliminate your Opponents you will have access to 19 unique playing cards that will either help you attack your enemies, defend your own territories or destabilize other players.<br/><br/>These cards are separated into 3 categories:<br/>Red cards that may only played during your turn,<br/>Yellow cards that may played anytime,<br/>and Blue cards that can only be played under certain circumstances.<br/><br/>The rules evolve with the amount of players that play. When playing with 2 to 3 people, all other players are your enemies. You can build temporary alliances but be ready for the inevitable backstabbing. When playing with 4 to 6 players you have Allies that you may not attack, but will still need to compete with to win the game!<br/><br/>Additional information:<br/><br/>Algarade is a one-man project from the mind of Olivier Etienne Miller. Originally a game to be played with his family and close friends, it became quite popular in his circle of friends which eventually lead him to start a Kickstarter to spread the game to a wider audience!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Swingbridge is a card game for three players, based on Contract Bridge.<br/><br/>It is a standard deck, trick taking game, with variable partnerships. An auction phase is followed by card playing. Four hands are dealt: one per player plus an additional one which is placed face-up on the table (the &quot;dummy&quot;); initially, one player is allowed to exchange his hand with the dummy. During the auction phase the players attempt to communicate information about their hands by bidding; like in Bridge, bids specify how many tricks must be taken and what is the preferred trump suit (or lack thereof); in addition, bids also have a &quot;color&quot; that indicates what is the preferred partnership for that deal. After the auction, the team that has won the bid (the &quot;declarers&quot;) tries to win as many tricks as possible; the other player (the &quot;defender&quot;) plays both his own hand and the dummy's, and tries to take enough tricks to have the declarers fail their contract. The scoring system is almost identical to Bridge, but players have individual scores.<br/><br/>Swingbridge is presented as a book, written for an audience of Bridge players, which contains the basic rules of the game, some optional variants, and an in-depth analysis of the mechanics and peculiarities of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Description from the designer:<br/><br/>Sage Signs is a competitive faux-medieval card game for 2 to 4 players in which the players must make poker-like combinations of mystical Sign cards in a dominoes-like arrangement. Making combinations allows players to place summoning Seals to block opponents, cast crafty spells, and in the end summon a powerful (but benevolent) Spirit.<br/><br/>In a typical turn, you may use your two actions to either draw or place a numbered Sign card next to another card of the same value, one higher/lower value, or the same suit. Additionally, by discarding a Sign card onto an open spell slot, you may cast the spell of that card's suit, and by placing Seals atop a Sign card marked with a &quot;V,&quot; you may invoke the effects of one of the eight game-changing Virtue cards. When specific poker-like combinations of cards are made, a number of Seals corresponding to the strength of that combination may be put down. When someone has laid down all 7 of their Secondary Seals, they must create a combination of cards that yields more Seals than the the central Spirit card demands. The number of Seals indicated on the Spirit card (1 to 4) indicates the difficulty of the end game.<br/><br/>",

The great doors open reluctantly then slam shut with a boom once the group is inside. A lock clicks into place locking the group in the darkness. The Torch Carriers light up their torches and shoulder their packs. The heroes quickly scan the entry and seeing nothing threatening sheath their weapons and stride toward the single arched doorway on the opposite side of the room. At the midpoint of the room the floor begins to glow as inscribed runes and markings fade into view. With a soundless flash the heroes are vaporized leaving behind a small cloud of cinders drifting through the air like dying fireflies.<br/><br/>Once the Torch Carriers get past the stunned silence of their hero's&rsquo; demise, they decide to complete the task set before the heroes, find the dungeon exit and return home!<br/><br/>You play the part of the Torch Carriers. Unlike most dungeon crawlers, your character is not an epic hero trained in unique skills, covered in protective armor and armed to the teeth with custom weapons. The Torch Carriers have a pack of basic supplies and a torch. In order to survive the dungeon, complete the task, and escape you will have to use what you can find as you go.<br/><br/>Torch Carriers is a &ldquo;diceless&rdquo; dungeon-crawling party-based adventure game for 1-6 players. The Chapter-based story system ensures that no two games will ever be alike.<br/><br/>Built on Wrectangle Games &ldquo;Card Chaos&rdquo; Gameplay Engine, Torch Carriers allows you to play world-class RPG adventures dictated by the cards you draw rather than the dice you roll.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Neon Dawn is a character building, open-world, post-apocalyptic adventure board game for 1-5 players.  It is set in the Waste, a post nuclear land steeped in radiation and full of danger, adventure and treasures to be found.  The Great War happened long enough ago that no one alive remembers what life used to be like.  Those that cling to life work hard to simply survive, overcoming challenges within the Waste every single day.  This is where you intend to make a name for yourself.  Your goal is to explore and survive the Waste, while becoming the most famous adventurer in the process!<br/><br/>Neon Dawn is an adventure game at its core, including 400 mini stories that can be experienced by adventurers of the Waste.  Players initially build out their character through a draft, then continue to develop their character through Items, Consumables and Traits obtained during game play, as well as the Companion you choose to adventure with.  Players can explore the world, salvage materials, build reputation with settlements, trade, craft Items, build buildings (for Fame and reputation) and complete Missions.<br/><br/>Neon Dawn was designed to be easy to learn, yet still provide deep game play and a thematic story experience.  Due to the variance in the cards, map tiles and dice rolls, each play through of Neon Dawn will provide a unique story experience specifically for the players at the table.  No two stories will be alike! (statistically, it's nearly impossible)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Renown - The Game brings back a traditional Austrian card game. The original game is still played in Austria but it is getting more and more forgotten. Decades ago there were many tournaments and it was played in almost every tavern. It is called &ldquo;Schnapsen&rdquo;, probably because the winner was rewarded with a shot of schnapps. We have modernized it with a lot of modifications, action and player interactions. We have added a set of action cards which can alter the whole gameplay.<br/><br/>Renown - The Game features four different races: the bloodthirsty Ogres, the forsaken Humfrogs, the greedy Goblins and the schnapps-loving Shiners<br/><br/>Be the first one to earn 48 points by beating your enemies in different round types to win the game. Send your characters into fights and gather 66 Renown which you need to get your beloved points.<br/><br/>To reward the best strategic player there are seven different round types, which give you more points, the more difficult your strategy is to follow. Some of the rounds require you to earn 66 Renown fast, others will challenge you to win all the fights.<br/><br/>Each race has five different characters, who are ranked like this: The Chief, the Warden, the Sorceress, the Soldier and the Dork.<br/><br/>You start each round by selecting a dominating race, which makes every member of this race stronger than any card of the other races. When a player plays a character, the other players usually have to follow with the same race, if they have one. The higher ranked characters beat the lower ranked ones. This means: The chief beats everyone from the warden to the dork, the warden beats everyone from the sorceress to the dork and so on. If a player does not have a card of the first played race, he has to play one of the dominating race. If the player does not have a card of the dominating race either, he needs to send another race into the fight. However, this one cannot beat the first played card.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Dare you enter?<br/><br/>Based on the legend of Theseus and the Minotaur, Knossus is set in the ancient time, where 7 youths have been sent by the City of Athens, to be sacrificed to the minotaur in the labyrinth of King Minos.<br/><br/>It is designed to be a gateway game suitable for a family to play or as light relief between more heavyweight games. Gameplay style varies with the group - from fast and furious, action packed charging around the labyrinth, to tactical chess-like experience where strategic players face off in a game played several moves ahead.<br/><br/>The game plays by drawing 4 cards - you must choose two to control your hero, and two to control the Minotaur. They may be played in any order, and augmented by receiving the blessing of the gods from various shrines found in the labyrinth. There are also items to help you in your quest but you may only carry one at a time.<br/><br/>Balancing luck with strategy, Knossus is designed to engage the group for the whole 30 minutes - even eliminated players are still able to control the minotaur for that last sweet act of revenge. And there's nothing so satisfying as sending the monster charging into your rivals, slaying them, only to end his run on the point of your sword, winning you the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The throne has remained vacant for far too long, demons assault the city, and the people have become desperate. You have travelled far to arrive in the city of Bloodstone. The desperate situation in the city has forced the Council to reach out to the powerful Demigods in hopes of finding a new ruler. You have five days to gain the favour of the council and the people. They are eager to be impressed.<br/>    Your paths to victory are numerous: complete quests to gain favor and influence; slay the demons that spawn each night and harvest them for the riches that lay within; amass great wealth and purchase symbols of status to impress the masses. <br/>        You are not the only hero to see this as their opportunity. Others have journeyed to the city and will fight to impede your progress at every turn. Can you win the favour of the Council and become the next Ruler?<br/><br/>Demons and Demigods is a deep strategy game with immense replayability. In fact, no two games will ever be the same.<br/><br/>Players can all play with the same faction abilities by playing as &quot;Civilians&quot;, or each player can choose to play as a Demigod - a unique faction with special abilities and Rages. Play as a Warlock, Earth Elemental, Giant, or one of the other unique Demigods.<br/><br/>Throughout 5 days, players will track their time using a unique and intuitive time track. This track consists of 24 spaces. Each player begins with 12 time before the Midnight Oil ends their day, but through upgrades it is possible to improve Ambition and start the day with more time. Each movement through the city and actions at a building costs time, so plan your route and day wisely. Whoever has the most time remaining in the day will always play next - so player order is dynamic. Once you enter the Midnight Oil your day will end.<br/><br/>Players move their characters throughout the game board using a one-of-a-kind worker placement mechanic. Your character blocks building action spaces. When you move, the building action space becomes available. Each game includes 9 randomly placed buildings. Depending on your strategy and immediate needs you may want to visit the Butcher to gain Bloodstones, or the Blacksmith to buy gear. You may wish to travel to the Market to make some important trades, or maybe you need to visit the Grand Palace to improve your influence. During all of this, your character is also tasked with slaying the demons that lurk at buildings and playing quests. Slaying demons and playing quests allow a character to gain influence at a building. This is tracked through a dynamic area control mechanic which makes use of a character's energy. Quests are also assigned to 1 of the 5 council members. Each member has specific themes attached to the quest, and at the end of the game, you are rewarded for having a variety of council members showing. This means you must diversify your strategies in order to impress the entire council.<br/><br/>Each day players will try to improve their engine to maximize the income at Day's End. They do this by unlocking dormant cubes and visiting the Philosopher's Study for upgrades. Spend the Bloodstones you have collected from slaying demons to upgrade your character. Some upgrade examples are: Income (silver, gold, energy regeneration, etc.), and Ambition (more time).<br/><br/>Your character starts with 18 energy cubes.

Their only hope is a small band of local residents, dedicated to upholding the law, protecting the public and banishing the evil, marauding monsters from this once great city.<br/><br/>No-one knows the true identities of these local heroes (except for Mrs McGinty, who knits their superhero outfits) and you, a member of the Tight Red Pants Alliance.<br/><br/>It's time to pull them up, and take them down! The villains that is. Tight Red Pants is a simple to play, fun super hero battling card game that will keep your little heroes and grown up ones entertained for hours. Comes with everything you need to play including the world's first flat dice! A game for 2-4 people aged 8 plus<br/><br/>How to play Tight Red Pants the game<br/><br/>You control a bunch of home grown heroes and have to save the General Public (GPs) from evil villains before Teatime. The game ends when either: The Teatime card turns up 3 times or if all four locations are out with one villain and one GP or one hero wins 5 battles<br/><br/>When setting up you remove the dice card and put all the green bus stop (GP cards) to one side, public side down. Choose a location card and place face up on the table. Shuffle the rest and deal three hand cards face down to each player, then place the remaining cards face down as the draw pile. Shuffle and use again when depleted. The discard pile will go next to this.<br/><br/>Play. On your go pick up one card and play as many hand cards as you wish. Do not hold more than five. &lsquo;Red Pant&rsquo; cards are always played or discarded if no effect. Play goes clockwise<br/><br/>MAKING A SCENE. As you lay cards fights break out all over the city (table) but first you need a location card then a villain and finally one GP from the bus stop. Place this on the location. This scene is then complete<br/><br/>HOW TO FIGHT VILLAINS. Players then (on their go) use any hero in their hand to fight that baddie. Defeat the villain to collect and save the GP cards to eventually win the game. Save your GPs to one side. If you play all your cards pick up another three and have one more go. Move on after one fight.<br/><br/>PUNCH-UP Process Once a location, a villain and some GPs are in place any hero can battle the villain. Use the Dice Card to fight, adjust the stats for any item or henchmen cards added.<br/><br/>Note these stats down before fighting on the score pad.<br/><br/>Now try to roll your Attack or below to hit. If you do, then roll again for damage to reduce the villain&rsquo;s HPs to zero. Villains then roll in the same way. Ask another player to roll for them. Continue until either is defeated. If you win you get to keep the GPs, if you lose the villain stays on play and another GP is added to scene. You go is over.<br/><br/>The game continues in the same way each player challenging the villains at the locations. Collect and use your item cards to help your heroes and eventually the tea time will turn up 3 times.<br/><br/>Then it's game over. The player with the most GPs wins or nobody wins if the villains overrun the city<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Groks Games brings you a thrilling turn based card game where you and your friends fight off zombie hordes until there is only one survivor left standing. Use Ranged and Melee weapons to deal damage to the attacking zombies, but watch out, one of the other players may attempt to turn on you in an instant. Game includes over 180 cards, 2 D6 Dice, 20 Bite tokens, and the &quot;Rules to live by&quot; instruction booklet.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:  Be the last living Survivor. Help or betray your friends to survive and win!<br/><br/>SETUP: There are 3 decks. The Zombie Deck, Loot Deck, and Event Deck. Shuffle each deck and place them face down. Each Survivor (player) is dealt 5 cards from the Loot Deck for their starting hand. Now you&rsquo;re ready to fight some zombies!<br/>       <br/>HOW TO DIE: Each time you attack a zombie and do not kill it, the zombie bites you and you receive 1 Bite Token. If you have 5 or more Bite Tokens and you have no way of healing yourself, you die and are out of the game.<br/><br/>THE LINE: The Line is where zombies go when they&rsquo;re revealed. The Line is how you fight multiple zombies you encounter. Zombies are set one after the other in a line in the order they are revealed. When you enter your combat phase, the first zombie in the line becomes the Active Zombie. (See Combat Phase for more information.)<br/><br/>HOW YOUR TURN WORKS: If it is your turn, you are the Active Survivor. To start your turn you&rsquo;ll encounter a zombie.<br/><br/>ENCOUNTER PHASE: Reveal the top card of the Zombie Deck and put it on The Line.<br/> PREPARATION PHASE: You have a chance to play or trade Loot Cards from your hand before engaging the Active Zombie in combat. You may also ask for help and make a Contract with any Survivor(s). (See Contracts for more information.) When you&rsquo;re done preparing, move to the Combat Phase.<br/><br/>COMBAT PHASE:<br/>The first zombie in The Line becomes the Active Zombie.<br/>The Active Zombie or Event&rsquo;s ability takes effect (if any).<br/>If it is a zombie card, you may try to run. (See Running section for more information.)<br/>If you fail to run or don&rsquo;t want to, declare which weapon you're attacking with and attack the Active Zombie. (See Weapons and Combat for more information.)<br/>Repeat this process until all of the zombies on The Line are dead and then loot their corpses.<br/><br/>LOOT PHASE: <br/>Draw Loot cards for all of the zombies you have killed. (The number of loot a zombie gives is next to the treasure chest at the bottom right corner of the Zombie card.)<br/>Events such as Smoke Bomb and Bad Luck prevent you from receiving loot on that turn.<br/>Running from zombies and making contracts will change how much loot you receive.<br/>Survivors may play, trade, give away, or discard any cards they can before the end of a turn.<br/><br/>When the Loot Deck runs out of cards to draw, do not re-shuffle the Loot Deck. Once the loot is gone, zombies are worth zero loot and you must survive with what you have!<br/><br/>END OF TURN:  All Survivors must discard down to 5 cards or 10 if they have an active Backpack.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The board for this game is displayed on the wall in the museum. The board displays the names and logos of 48 different railroads of the united states circa 1948. The board shows the routes of these different railroads and the major cities they services. I assume this was a pickup and delivery game, but I am not sure.<br/><br/>The game board is 15 X 24 inches.<br/><br/>A little more information from the Museum on this:<br/><br/>&quot;The box was falling apart and so was discarded, as was the instruction sheet. I recall there were also small, lightweight cardboard markers, probably some original and some added by a previous owner.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;The object was to earn points by delivering carloads of freight to destinations named on the board, and to earn more points than opponents by controlling routes so they could not make deliveries.&quot;<br/><br/>&quot;Of the 48 railroads named, only two still operate under those names: Union Pacific, and Kansas City Southern.&quot; December 2016<br/><br/>",

It is your first day at the job and the boss is smelling something fishy about the new recruits. He places you in the Ultra Modern Testing Grounds to test your skills. The one who ends up the best will start working... for others, tough luck.<br/><br/>Pick up gear tiles as quickly as possible and try to make right connections and fill up the board... 1-4 players, virtually no setup time and 1-3 minutes per round.<br/><br/>During a game, each player picks up gear tiles from the common pool and adds them to their own board. Each tile must be connected (diagonally or orthogonally) to the engine tile via coloured squares. If a player successfully connects 3 goal tiles with the engine tile so that goal tiles turn in the right direction, he scores 3 points for each. Each empty space on the board is worth -1 point at the end of the game.<br/><br/>Players must be careful, invalid connections might make whole sections of the board invalid and empty before the scoring. No two tiles may be connected via different colours, and a tile connected with two tiles that turn in two different directions is also invalid.<br/><br/>A round lasts between 1 and 3 minutes (players choice, depends on skill). The player with the best score is the winner.<br/><br/>Players may also choose to use or not use both sides of the gear tiles that easily show which gear turns in which direction. Using both sides makes the game much easier and it is recommended for the first games.<br/><br/>",

The first player who reaches 20 points (40 points for 4 players) on board meter, will be the winner of the battle. Damage points are equal to life points (red cross with specific number in each card).<br/><br/>Every card has 7 different sectors (boxes):<br/><br/>Upper: from left to right :<br/>First box - Velocity of weapon<br/>Second box -  Weapon's Penetration level <br/>Third box - Own armor level<br/>Fourth box - Own life points<br/><br/>Lower:<br/>First box - movement <br/>Middle Double number target - 2 x 12sided dice (black for German/White for Soviet), both numbers in dice is the damage area for the weapon. A 10 on the dice is a Critical hit &amp; any unit who receives this damage must be removed from the battle ground.<br/>Finally, the blue pointer with the specific number is the encounter points needed for this unit to use it in the deployment phase of the battle.<br/><br/>Each turn:<br/>1. Encounter points (both armies start with 5 each)<br/>2. Draw phase - each player draws 2 cards<br/>3. Move phase - each player can move their units<br/>4. Deployment phase - each player can deploy any unit if he has the necessary encounter points<br/>5. Engagement phase - each player can attack the enemy player based on the abilities of their units<br/>6. Discard phase<br/>7.

The four opportunists must venture, not fully aware of the dangers, into a subterranean labyrinth. Seeking what they believe are rare gems, they soon discover the stones contain elemental powers. Threatened, they find themselves maneuvering quickly through warp portals, battling natives, and avoiding traps in an ever-changing maze. Escaping could prove problematic with a monstrous guardian willing to kill to protect its undisturbed dwelling. But returning to Centershaft and getting out alive is of most importance!<br/><br/>Centershaft Fallen Elements is a strategy tile-based thematic board game. In the game, players will explore the labyrinth to recover Element tokens. The goal of the game is to be the first to collect one of each Element token and then be the first to return to the Centershaft Hub tile.<br/><br/>On a player's turn they will draw from the event deck, resolve the card by following the instructions on the card (battling monsters, for example) or if it allows, they may keep to use at a later turn. They will also resolve any current cards they possess or abilities they have before they move their character miniature.<br/><br/>",

One text passage refers to the leviathan chain, but if this is the name of the game or some other principal is still unclear. A suggestion is that this game is better named Quint.<br/><br/>Holistic was according to Erik Magus L&aring;ng first played on scientific principles by a party of gentlemen who frequented the Holland House, Arkum Street, Hundon (Borough of St Edmundsbury) around 1728. but the game never became fashionable. To be a member of this group you had to write and published research, trivia games or myths of the souls journey, which is the cause records of it still exists today. The game was much later rediscovered and painstakingly recreated by a historian and game design researcher.<br/><br/>The game is party mention in the book &ldquo;A Short Treatise on the Game of Yellow King&rdquo; published in 1742, in &ldquo;The Principles of holism and its Practice Illustrated on an Original System, by Means of Hands, Numbers and Symbols&rdquo; published in 1862 and in the incomplete manuscripts and personal diary of the above mention Magus L&aring;ng.

        "description": "But Not In Vain is a war game simulation of the battle for Calais in May, 1940. After breaking out of the Ardennes the German armored and motorized forces drove for the Channel ports to divide the Allied forces from one another. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) in Belgium and the British High Command in London were in a quandary as to how best to proceed; whether to find a way to breakout of the German encirclement or withdraw from the continent back to Great Britain. The Allied forces in Calais, composed of recently landed British regular and reservist (Territorials) infantry, as well as elements of the 1st Armoured Division, received contradictory orders as to whether they were to defend the port, advance and attack, or withdraw. The battle of Calais in many ways came to stand for the tragic outcome  of the campaign for the Allies in 1940. The garrison&rsquo;s determined stand also took a toll on the German&rsquo;s 10th Panzer Division, and that any invasion of Great Britain would not be easy or similar to what transpired in France and Low Countries.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better?<br/><br/>A complete game of But Not In Vain is composed of the following:<br/><br/><br/>     This rules booklet<br/>     One 11&quot; by 17&quot; map<br/>     One Players&rsquo; Aid Sheet<br/>     180 single-sided, un-mounted counters<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Take this filmy journey as your friends turn foes, your romance is put to the test and you gotta fight for what is right at every turn.<br/><br/>Players are able to keep track of each of their attribute points (Strength, Charm and Kindness) To prove your skills you must earn points for each of the three attributes. Points start at 0 and will evolve throughout the game. While players get ready to play, a Hero or Heroine card is laid down on the table &ndash; this card becomes the object of affection for all players. Each of these Hero or Heroine cards have attribute points, and  once these points are met by a player, he or she can play the Happy Ending card and win the game.<br/><br/>Once players decide which Hero or Heroine will be on the table as the goal of the game, the remaining Hero and Heroine cards are put aside and no longer a part of the game.<br/>Action Cards, Actor Cards, Song Cards and Counter Attack Cards are shuffled and SIX CARDS are then distributed to each player, and cannot be displayed to anyone.  <br/>The remaining cards become the game deck and will be put face down on the table. This is the deck players will draw cards from in order to advance in the game.  <br/>During his turn, a player can play any card he has in hands. His turn will finish when the player discards all the cards he wishes from his hand to the &lsquo;discard deck&rsquo; next to the original &lsquo;playing deck&rsquo;. Cards will be face up on the &lsquo;dicard deck&rsquo;. <br/>The player can also finish his turn by simply choosing to &ldquo;pass&rdquo; without discarding any cards during his turn. But the player cannot end his turn with more than 3 cards in his hand, if a player has more than 3 cards in hand at the end of his turn he must choose a remaining card to be discarded. <br/>All the cards used during a turn (i.e.: Actor Cards, Song Cards, Counter Attack Cards) will be discarded to the &lsquo;discard deck&rsquo; as well. <br/>After all players complete their turns, the first player will draw as many cards as necessary from the playing deck until that player has 6 cards in hand<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The board has a factory at the center (the target for the bomber), two fighter bases on the upper and lower left, and a bomber base at the lower right. The rest of the board is filled with images of colored airplanes connected to between 2 and 7 other locations (bases, factory and other plane images) by white two-way arrows. The bomber is silver; the smaller fighter figures have colored wings: red, yellow, brown, blue and green.<br/><br/>The bomber moves first, along any arrow to an open adjacent space. The five fighters then move in turn, and the order must be kept the same from turn to turn. Planes must move if possible, but cannot move to a space already occupied.<br/><br/>The bomber must reach the factory to drop its bombs and then return to base. It may bomb, move off the factory and return to bomb again without returning to base. If it bombs once or twice, it must return to its own base. If it succeeds in bombing three times, it may return to any of the three bases. If the bomber gets back to base, the bombing player wins.<br/><br/>The goal of the fighters is to surround the bomber, occupying all of its adjacent spaces so that it is unable to move. The fighter player who makes the final decisive move to surround the bomber is considered the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Three major companies have caused corruption and crime in Blazer City, and a group of law students have witnessed their crimes and aim to shut the companies down. However, the companies' bosses have hired hitmen to discard of any loose ends that are of risk to their reputation. The game has two different kinds of players with different goals and gameplay. Targets are trying to collect evidence to prosecute companies while they avoid being eliminated by the hitmen. Hitmen try to earn money by eliminating the targets before they are able to prosecute the companies that hired them. Each player is given unique advantages through a contact card that is dealt to them at the beginning of the game, and players must complete dice objectives during the game to perform actions like dueling, interrogating, prosecuting, and lock-picking gates. An alternate version of the game allows hitmen to steal evidence instead of eliminating players.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The first player to land on each black space collects its flag(s). Another 18 red-colored spaces represent events that force players to move forward or back along the track. The winner is the player who returns home with the most flags (first player home wins a tie).<br/><br/>The six metal U-boat pieces are numbered U-8, U-9, U-21, U-28, U-29 and U-45. According to Wikipedia, each has a notable history:<br/><br/>U-8: Sank 5 British ships on Feb. 23-24, 1915, then was trapped in nets and sunk by gunfire on March 4.<br/><br/>U-9: Sank the &ldquo;Live Bait Squadron&rdquo;, three Cressy-class armoured cruisers (HMS Cressy, Aboukir, Hogue), on Sept. 22, 1914 (space number 6 on the track), protected cruiser HMS Hawke on Oct. 15, 13 British merchant ships and one Russian naval vessel by Nov. 1915. Withdrawn for training use in April 1916. It was the only U-boat to be awarded an Iron Cross by Kaiser Wilhelm II.<br/><br/>U-21: One of the first U-boats to be equipped with diesel engines (U19 class). First submarine to sink a ship with a self-propelled torpedo on Sept. 5, 1914, destroying the cruiser HMS Pathfinder off the Firth of Forth. Transferred to the Mediterranean to support the Turks in early 1915, sinking British battleships HMS Triumph and HMS Majestic off Gallipoli, as well as French navy vessel Amiral Charner in Feb. 1916. Transferred to the Austrian navy for a time to attack Italian shipping, then back to Germany for unrestricted commerce war in March 1917. Retired for training in 1918. Merchant victims included 13 British, 7 Italian, 6 Dutch, 4 Norwegian, 2 French, 2 Russian, 2 Portuguese and 1 Swedish ships (2 damaged, rest sunk).<br/><br/>U-28: Sank 40 ships during five patrols, starting with British steamer Iberian on July 30, 1915. Was sunk on its final patrol after torpedoing British steamer Olive Branch, which exploded and fatally damaged U-28 in turn. No survivors.<br/><br/>U-29: Sank 4 and damaged 2 merchant ships during March 1915. Rammed and sunk by HMS Dreadnought in Pentland Firth on Mar. 18, the only submarine to be sunk by a battleship.<br/><br/>U-45: Sank 27 and damaged 1 ship between 27 April 1916 and 24 July 1917.

        "description": "Welcome, jagger, to the Grid. The Grid is an isolated network specifically designed to test illicit hacking software. You will scan the Grid for data sources, which you will use to power your programs. Battle other jaggers to see who has the best programs. Win, and know that your software is good enough to take on corporate networks. Lose, and rebuild your software suite to try again.<br/><br/>Jagger Arena is a dueling card game for 2-4 players. Players are 'jaggers', criminal hackers that us AI programs to break into corporate networks. Jaggers come to the Grid to test their programs against each other; battling until only one jagger is left standing.<br/><br/>Before a match, you will chose a program set of 7 cards to use in the battle. The game comes with four pre-built program sets, but you can also mix the different programs to create your own custom set.<br/><br/>On your turn, you will reveal a face down card in the Grid of 25 cards. Your goal is to make a match of 3 or more of the same data source symbol. These data source matches are used to trigger attacks from your programs, or use a program's special abilities. Certain cards can generate chains, allowing you to reveal multiple cards in a turn. And watch out for logic bombs! Logic bombs can reveal a large number of cards, giving you an opportunity to make multiple matches. Your program abilities can alter the Grid, and cause various effects that hinder your opponent's programs.<br/><br/>Using program attacks and abilities, you will attempt to delete your opponent's programs. If all your programs are deleted, you are eliminated from the match. The last player left is declared the winner.<br/><br/>Future expansion packs will include new program sets and abilities, allowing for more variety when creating custom program sets. The introduction of new logic bombs will cause more chaos in the Grid.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>62 Data Source cards<br/>28 Program cards (Alice, Boris, Cameron, and Logan program sets)<br/>9 Logic Bomb cards<br/>24 Damage tokens<br/>16 Strengthen/Weaken tokens<br/>16 Infect tokens<br/>6 Data Source tokens<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Universal Miniatures Battles (UMB) is a generic set aiming to cover both all of history up to the Late Medieval period as well as any fantasy of a similar technological level.<br/><br/>All troops are divided into a number of basic categories, e.g. light cavalry, skirmishers, or (for fantasy) monstrous infantry. These are then customized by rating each unit for skill, discipline, stamina, and any approprate special rules.<br/><br/>Players then take turns activating the divisions of their army, with any or all units of an activated division able to shoot, move, charge etc. Any that do not do so are available to react to enemy activations later in the turn.<br/><br/>The game is meant to be played by special attack and defense dice, but these can trivially be replaced with ordinary D6's. Any genre or period miniatures can be used, although the author recommends that both sides use the same scale!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Castle Strife Games is a collection of 4 chess variants that also includes traditional chess (on the back of the quad-fold board). The Castle Strife Games website, CastleStrife.com, includes a full description and rules for all 4 variants:  (traditional chess is Level 1), Castle Siege Chess (Level 2), Castle Action Chess (Level 3), Castle Attack Chess (Level 4), and the team game Castle Challenge Chess (Level 5). The games are for sale on Etsy.com. More information, including how to play, is on CastleStrife.com. Pictures of VCU students playing the games at the Chess Club at VCU can be seen at the Castle Chess Club meetup site.<br/><br/>Castle Siege Chess has been programmed in Zillions of Games and can be played on a registered copy of Zillions of Games 2.0 or higher (maybe even 1.0). The latest version of the electronic game can be downloaded from my website CastleStrife.com. Click Castle Siege Chess on the home page and then click the Computer Games button in the header menu. The download links are in the middle of the page. You can then play the game either against the computer or another person by simply double-clicking the .zrf file for either the 590 pixel version for laptops or the 800 pixel one for larger monitors. It can even be played online through Zillions of Games.<br/><br/>The circular chess board is actually a circular board merged with a square board in its center. Byzantine Chess (aka Circular Chess) is played on a 4 track circular board with a hole in the center. It has 2 directions of attack on the opponent's starting position. I (Rich VanDeventer, inventor, designer, developer, and publisher of Castle Strife Games) decided to merge a 6x6 square chess board into the hole and morph it into the inner ring of the circular board so that all chess paths progressed smoothly from the square area into the circular area. I ended up with 3 circular paths, 1 transition circular path, and a 4x4 square center and I named the board CirSquare 96 (it has 96 spaces). In merging a square with a circle, I could not avoid having 4 triangular spaces in the transition circle. Those 4 triangular spaces have turned out to be one of the main advantages of the board. Not only does the CirSquare 96 chess board have 3 directions (front and two sides) of attack (versus a traditional chess board's 1 direction of attack--frontal only) on the opponent's castle (starting area), but the 4 triangles provide a way for the Queen, Rook, and Bishop to gain a 5th direction of coverage when their paths pass through a triangular space, because they can exit either of the other two corners or sides (depending on how they entered the triangular space).<br/><br/>The CirSquare 96 is exactly 50% larger than an 8x8 chess board. If all 24 spaces in each castle are used for pieces, it has exactly 50% more pieces than traditional chess. So the ratio of starting pieces to open spaces in the battlefield (the 4 rows of spaces between the castles) is 1:1, which is the same as traditional chess, so the board has the same feeling of openness at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>All the traditional chess pieces move the same as they do in traditional chess. You can also castle, if you use the standard setup for the traditional chess pieces. Since the board is 12 squares wide across the battlefield, there are 12 Pawns, which of course is 4 more than traditional chess. If you use only the standard 8 pieces of a traditional chess set that are not Pawns, there will be 4 spaces in the back of the castle that are open. That is how I initially played the game. It played very well, but felt too much like traditional chess. So I decided to come up with pieces to fill those 4 spaces. First, I used 2 more Knights and 2 more Bishops. That provided very strong armies, but it was not different enough for me. So started a search for medieval warriors that the traditional chess set was missing.<br/><br/>I began looking at medieval war paintings and soon realized that the main things missing were Archers and Catapults. So I put 2 Archers and 2 Catapults in the back of the castles. I made their moves compliment the Knights, Bishops, and Rooks. The Archer became a short-range Bishop that can jump and the Catapult became a short-range Rook that can jump. They have worked out to be outstanding additions to the traditional chess set. Almost everyone who has played Castle Siege Chess at least 3 times has ended up either liking it or loving it. I started a chess club at VCU in Richmond, VA almost 3 years ago and introduced my games to the members. Some of the traditional chess purists did not want to play them, but many of the very good chess players and a lot of the average players played Castle Siege Chess fairly often. Several of the club members switched to playing only Castle Siege Chess, although that was not my intention because I love both traditional chess and my games. Much like Bobby Fischer liked both traditional chess and chess variants.<br/><br/>A few years later, I decided to try to make Castle Siege Chess more like conducting a real medieval war on a chess board. I added Action cards to Castle Siege Chess to get Castle Action Chess. The Action cards are mainly used to give special moves to pieces that they normally could not perform. That eventually worked out quite well, but there was still a lot of aspects of medieval war action were missing.<br/><br/>So I began thinking about what else was missing. What about weapons? So I added weapons to Castle Action Chess and got Castle Attack Chess. Weapons allow your pieces to capture opponent's pieces without having to move your piece--the weapon makes the move. That soon began working very well, and was quite popular among several of the chess club members. But there was still a lot of medieval war activity that was missing.<br/><br/>Then I started really thinking hard about what else was missing. I came up with:  money to buy weapons and captured pieces; reinforcements; a dungeon and oubliette for captured pieces; challenges between pieces; and, a team of players (General, Commander, and Finance Officer) for each side. To make it all work, I added aspects of other board games:  dice, action cards, power cards, and time cards. I also came up with Catastrophe cards. I added more weapons--both offensive weapons for the pieces and defensive &amp; offensive weapons for the board. It took several years of play testing to work out the kinks, but the game is now quite perfected. And it is a blast to play once all the players have played it at least 3 times so they know it quite well.<br/><br/>Besides CastleStrife.com, you can also go to my meetup site--Castle Chess Club meetup--to see hundreds of pictures of the Chess Club at VCU (Virginia Commonwealth University) in action playing both traditional chess and my Castle Strife Games (mainly Castle Siege Chess). We even had several Castle Siege Chess tournaments. My games are for sale on Etsy.com, just use the Etsy search field to find Castle Siege Chess. Links to all my games are on each listing. I hope that you will check them out.<br/><br/>Sorry for the long description.<br/><br/>",

The game is played over four seasonal summits during which players use imperial resources to try to bribe members of The Bourse who vary in their influence.  Whoever controls the most influence at the end of the game dominates The Bourse and wins.<br/><br/>Great Work! is for 2 players and takes 10-15 minutes to play.  Players invest imperial resources to contribute to building four great works.  The player whose investments pay off the most wins the game.<br/><br/>Cartel is for 2-4 players and takes 10-15 minutes to play. In the game, players are Merchant Princes seeking to dominate The Bourse by controlling Bourseholders to create a Cartel with a monopoly in one of the Imperial Resources.

These women were not ornaments; they were as dangerous as their male counterparts, amply able to defend their homes and property while the armies were away on campaign. Historically Onna-Bugeisha have been associated with the Naginata and Kaiken as fighting weapons; one very long and one very short! That is not to say they were limited to those weapons and yumi, yari, katana and teppo all feature in an Onna-Bugeisha&rsquo;s armoury.<br/><br/>Onna-Bugeisha have existed as long as there have been people on the Japanese archipelago although not named as such until much later. The earliest ones being as much myth as a legend, including the very real Empress Jingū (169-269 AD), widow of the Emperor Chūai. She is purported to have led an invasion of Korea which was known for its success without any casualties. Living to 100 years old she is still honoured today and often held as an example of everything the Onna-Bugeisha symbolise.<br/><br/>The Warlord studio has worked hard to bring you these stunning and intricately detailed models, perhaps some of the best we have made!<br/><br/>The box set contains:<br/><br/>7 exquisite metal Onna-Bugeisha models<br/>    cards to play Test Of Honour<br/>    Campaign rules booklet<br/><br/>",

It's hard to have pre-made answers, so conversations become energetic, challenging, memorable.<br/><br/>With different game modes, the rules adapt to the number of people playing, the depth of conversation they want and how well they know each other. The goal is always the same: tell stories.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Battle for Formosa was the final large-scale campaign associated with the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95.  The island was ceded to Japan in April 1895 by the Treaty of Shimonoseki which ended the war but the island proclaimed its independence from China and formed a republic in May 1895 following Japan's victory.  The Japanese, therefore, mobilized their forces to gain control of their new territory.  Although ill-prepared for the Japanese onslaught, and the Chinese Empire unable or unwilling to offer any support, the island's garrison and inhabitants put up a bitter and protracted resistance, one that cost both sides dearly.<br/><br/>In 1884 and 1885, France invaded Formosa in an attempt to wrest control of the island from the Chinese following their campaign in Indochina and the attack at Foochow that resulted in the destruction of the Fukien Fleet. Already over-stretched and with most of their warships badly in need of refit and repair, Admiral Courbet still went ahead with the invasion. The French landed at Keelung, but then became bogged down in trench warfare. The Chinese were able to send reinforcements and supplies to the Formosan garrison through the rather weak French blockade. Although stalemated on Formosa, the French were able to capture the Pescadore islands when they took control of the key island of Peng-hu. In January and February, both sides sent reinforcements, escalating the conflict that threatened possible intervention by other governments to end the French aggression. This scenario covers the last months of the conflict when it could have gone either way.<br/><br/>Can you do as well or better than your historical counterparts?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to keep your troops together while attacking opposing players. The player who obtains the most points through contiguous tiles wins. The game has a comic, marshal theme.<br/><br/>To start the game, each player shakes their respective game bags with the associated tiles, then randomly pulls out five tiles and places them on the side of the game board. These tiles will not be used in the game. The players can then place the remaining twenty tiles near the game board for use during the game.<br/><br/>The first player places any one of the twenty tiles in any of the squares, with the front side facing up. The next player follows, then the third and fourth players, who place tiles on the board until there is no space left. Players score points by having contiguous, numbered tiles of the same color. Two or more contiguous numbered tiles are called runs. Two or more numbered tiles must be touching, otherwise no points will be given. A player can have multiple runs.<br/><br/>There are several different ways to attack opposing players or to protect a player's troops. The use of offensive or defensive tactics makes the game interesting, and is central to the game's strategy.<br/><br/>The player who scores the most points at the end of the game wins. Points are tallied by adding up runs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grimmsdorf is a 2-4 player co&ouml;perative town-building game of lore, exploration, and survival set in a dark fairytale forest sometime in Europe's distant past. In this world of struggle and ignorance, wearied villagers are never sure where reality ends and fantasy begins. Fairies, famines, wolves, and witches seem to lurk around every bend. Real history and oral mythologies are blended together in one world of mystery, fear, and adventure.<br/><br/>Players have to work together to avoid starvation, overcome magickal curses, build up their town, and explore the vast wilderness beyond their small world if they want a chance to survive. The themes and mechanics are tightly woven together, to create a rich and compelling experience for players.<br/><br/>If they don't meet a trickster dwarf or a pack of hungry wolves first, 40 unique fairytale characters - both familiar and obscure - can strike out on their adventures based on their original fairytales. They'll have to balance their thirst for glory with the need to work the land, and construct helpful buildings such as apothecaries, scriptoriums, and hunting lodges. But if they succeed, their stories will live on and they can become the stuff of legend.<br/><br/>Games run between 90-150 minutes and involve a mix of autonomous actions and team strategizing. Players work to feed the town while also playing through their characters' stories (which ultimately garners point and satisfies the win condition). When certain terrain tiles are discovered via exploration, they can farm or harvest resources to build new buildings, which in turn multiply the yield from these resource tiles. Buildings also boost characters' stat points (Charm, Fortitude and Wit; tracked on a household ledger) which helps them satisfy the requirements to start on their stories (for example, Snow White needs a certain amount of charm to be the fairest of them all and start on her story). When a new terrain tile is uncovered, players also have a chance for an event card, bring additional narrative elements to the game - and in this way players can explore and adventure independently of their story and of other players' actions. The risks and rewards increase the farther from town a character strays.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Teflarok is a Norse themed card game using runes from the Elder Futhark alphabet and imagery of Norse gods and goddesses. It plays best with 3-9 players, but there is a 2 player variant included in the rules.<br/><br/>Each player gets three &quot;Words of Power&quot; cards that show a selection of runes. You need to collect these runes (on Rune cards) in order to complete the Word. Upon completing the Word, you get the indicated number of Power Tokens. Throughout the game, you use your Power Tokens to bid on the Rune cards.<br/><br/>The game centers around a unique silent bidding process that allows you to either get the Rune cards you need or gain more Power tokens. During a bidding phase, players will secretly take tokens into their hand then everyone reveals their bids all at once. The game end is triggered when someone has either completed all of their Words of Power, or have gained 500+ points in Power Tokens. After one last turn, Power Tokens are counted up, and the player with the most Power wins.<br/><br/>Nine unique player screens are used to hide your tokens. Each one features art work and a short bio of a Norse god or goddess (the different gods are cosmetic only; gameplay is not changed.)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>Across the Bifrost bridge, the gods of Asgard await Ragnarok, the final battle, their inescapable fate. But what do the gods do in their downtime? Why, play Teflarok of course! It is the game of the gods after all. Now you get the chance to play as one of the gods. Collecting and casting magical runes that determine the fate of all mortals, best your friends in a game of strategy, vying for the most power.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the back of the box<br/><br/>",

The player reads the category on the card corresponding to the number on the spinner, or chooses if a joker is spun. Flip the sand timer and each player privately writes all the words they can think of matching the category. For each word written that o other player wrote, earn one point. The winner is the player with the most points after 10 rounds. Alternatively, use the board and the move forward for each point. Lookout for spaces such as lose a turn or advance two spaces!

        "description": "Warblog offers over 500 print and play modern war hex and counter games.<br/><br/>The game covers 1945 to date period with current wars covered.<br/><br/>Many of the games offer exceptional replay-ability, whilst some are simply to analysis and learning.<br/><br/>With over 500 games, there are games to suit most timeframes. You can find small games that might only take 30 minutes to play, but you can play it multiple times, playing for the best of three or best of five. Other games could be described as monster games that will literally take a very long time.<br/><br/>A key feature of the system is its simplicity. They games are designed for people that have a penchant for moving the counters about and not having to wade through large rule sets. Further, as the games are mostly situational, ie not operational, lines of supply and command are not critical, although some games do offer leader units and there are leader rules. The game has been designed to be failsafe from the ground up. This means you just move the counters about, observing movement allowances and terrain etc, but if you don't understand surround rules or terrain defence effects, its not that important, just play anyway. But if you want to tighten things up, there is a deep set of mechanics, including unit mix/matching, that is gaining a bonus for armour versus infantry stacks with no armour or mechanised etc.<br/><br/>The game includes all unit types including air and sea units with a wide range of additional units types for air defence, insurgents and irregular activity.<br/><br/>The scenarios are all historic and players are encouraged to learn their history and to even criticise the orders of battle and terrain arrangements as doing so is only further developing your own historical understanding and helping the War Blog team to help other people similarly.<br/><br/>The scenarios also encompass current events, so if you have an interest in following world events you can use War Blog to do so.<br/><br/>Many of the scenarios included are largely unstudied and certainly not common knowledge, and this whole library of scenarios is always on the increase with scenarios being updated with new intelligence and new scenarios added.<br/><br/>The game is currently under development and the rule set could well branch out to encompass features not covered on the online version which can readily be added to a paper based procedural rule set, for example, hidden movement and political intervention. Further, experienced players are encouraged to add their own rules up.<br/><br/>Many of the scenarios are unbalanced and there mainly for situational analysis, for example, in a educational environment. However, even in situations where a player might not stand a chance of winning, players can set house scoring based on how long a player could hold out and how they play in comparison to the historical timeline.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

With the boxed set of Code RED! players assume the mantle of the United States or the People's Republic of China.  Where conflict erupts is determined by which Theatres a player puts into play during their turn, from Washington to Beijing and everything in between.<br/><br/>Players initially construct their deck.  Paying attention to how many Theatre cards they include, tempering this against the number units and force multipliers they need in order to get the job done.  If your deck is too small you can't effectively carry out your plans or respond to threats.  Too big and you find that F-22 Raptor or Nimitz Carrier just never seems to be drawn.<br/><br/>Make sure your force mix can operate effectively within the Theatre you want to dominate.  Be wary, include forces that can defend your home territories too.<br/><br/>Aside from decks, players begin the game with an allocation of Command and Control tokens.  Command tokens let you do things in game, from drawing additional cards, withdrawing revealed units to activating force multipliers.  Running out of Command tokens can see your grand strategy grind to a halt or your ability to counter your opponents actions (like being able to intercept that ICBM!).<br/><br/>Control tokens are your life blood, the ability to gain Control tokens at the expense of your opponent is crucial to winning Code Red!  Run out of Control tokens at the end of your turn you lose the game.<br/><br/>Gameplay is handled with a three step turn sequence which alternates between players.<br/><br/>Resupply - Draw cards and possibly Command tokens if you're contesting Theatres.<br/><br/>Reorganistation - Deploy Theatres, deploy and reorganise your units and force multipliers within Theatres.  Pay attention when assigning forces to Theatres you wish to defend as well as those you wish to attack.<br/><br/>Operations - The business end of the turn, players activate units and force multipliers in a Theatre by declaring a Code Alert for each Theatre they contest.<br/><br/>Code Blue - do nothing<br/>  Code Green - Use your units to detect the enemies hidden forces<br/>  Code Yellow - Through a show of military power, force the enemy to withdraw from a Theatre, ceding control to you.<br/>  Code Red - War becomes hot!  Attack and destroy all enemy units within a Theatre, obliterate them to win control.<br/>  <br/>Remember, if you are reduced to zero Control tokens at the end of your turn you lose the game.<br/><br/>The game is expandable, we've just added 54 card expansions for both China and the United States.

They move (are fired) during movement, and the effects of these attacks are resolved before units are moved to the battle board during the combat resolution phase. To purchase and build these rockets, the German player must have built the previous iteration at least one turn prior. For example, to build the A-12, the Germans must have already built at least one A-11 on a previous turn, one A-10 before that, and so on. If using the V-1 rules, V-2s and A-4s are considered beginning technology and do not require V-1s to be built the prior turn. V-1, V-2 and A-4 are all available during the initial buy purchase and on Turn 1. Rockets are placed in the air support box during the Place Reinforcements phase and can be stockpiled and used as the player wishes.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

You will embark on a heroic quest where you'll meet oracles of wisdom, helpers and hinderers, encounter perils and pitfalls and battle forces that could destroy them.<br/><br/>Each player must enter The Abyss and also perform Heroic Feats as you prepare to journey home. Success is largely a function of strategy, opportunities presented by rolls of the die, and the elements of Fate and Magical Aid as you and your fellow players vie to win the game. Quintangled is not a game of war or world domination where conquest wins but a fun experience that is a metaphor for the universal journey of life that transcends time and culture. The game's unique two-part structure challenges players to see how choice changes everything and motives can make all the difference.<br/><br/>Every game experience will be different as you navigate many opportunities and encounter twists of Fate that will create a different outcome each time you play. The adventure of Quintangled is the adventure of life!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The Sixth Army, Hitler&rsquo;s largest force, is sent to capture Stalingrad. However, Stalin had prepared an effective snare; Circle around the city and keep the Sixth Army penned inside until their supplies ran out. To make matters worse, the Sixth Army was further prevented from leaving by Hitler&rsquo;s own order: Remain in Stalingrad and await rescue. <br/> Each of the players assumes one of the sides in this fateful encounter.

        "description": "Oddbods Go-Kards is a new take on the 'family' game genre. It's a family game for 'gamer' families with multiple games in one box.<br/><br/>At its most basic, it is a play-a-card-and-move-the-meeple party race game that lasts 10 to 15 minutes and can be picked up in a few minutes even by small children. The game has players perform fun real-life social challenges to reap in-game rewards.<br/><br/>In its more advanced forms, it features tactical take-that and power-up cards, modular and constructable tracks, a variety of rule-altering pit-stops and an emergent power-up marketplace. Players can setup and duke it out in races that take up to an hour or even more to finish.<br/><br/>The game is based on Oddbods, a Singaporean-British CGI-animated comedy television series produced by the Singapore-based studio One Animation.<br/><br/>The series focuses on seven different, sometimes battling characters called the Oddbods - Fuse, Pogo, Zee, Jeff, Bubbles, Slick and Newt.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Besides making a public show of the execution impress on the watching multitude preventing future crimes.<br/><br/>The execution takes place inside the Presidium, and Unique Corporation has become the executioners. They transform death and suffering in Dantesque spectacle.

The only way to escape those starving creatures is to find other lost kids and stay close to them at all times. It is also said that the sirains always find a way to seep into the most closely knit groups. By using evil thoughts, fear, hunger and loneliness, they lure their victims and snatch them, one by one, to devour them in the dark. In the end, only one lost child will find his way home. The others will never be seen again.&quot; Lost in the rain is a short roleplaying game of sadness and horror which invites you to take on the role of a child, lost in the great city and hunted by mysterious creatures.<br/><br/>Every player gets ten tokens at the start of the game. When a player loses their last token, the sirains eat them. Each turn (called a chapter) a player will be the main child for this chapter. The other players will play their child but also the sirains and the environment. Every time a player describes something that is frightening or harmful for the main child, the main child loses one token.<br/>When only one child remains, their player can describe how their child finds the way back to their home.<br/><br/>",

Distances on the colorful charts are listed for both 15mm and 28mm.  Developed over several years in conjunction with wargamers, re-enactors and ACW historians.  Innovative movement and redeployment system confronts the commander with the challenge of using European style formations in the difficult North American terrain.  Realistic casualty tracking system creates fog of war and a clean table-top free of visually intrusive game markers.  Fatique tracking sysem monitors fluctuating fighting strengths, putting premium on fresh units from reserves or by resting front line units.  Easily implemented command system emphasizes the relationship between divisional commanders and their brigadiers.  Special full-color deck of 50 &quot;crisis cards&quot; interjects drama and uncertainty to the battlefield.  The critical effect of supply issues on the battlefield is dealt with cleanly and effectively.  Lots of color throughout the text including many shots of nice looking games in progress.   Ratings for EVERY general on both sides who fought in the ACW - over 1,000 entries.  Continuing onlline support will be provided.  2 scenarios included: the first and second days of the 1862 Battle of 7 Pines in the peninsula.

        "description": "An app assisted fully customizable board game with some Chess, Stratego, Carcassonne, Ur, Senet, and Hnefatafl DNA.<br/><br/>With each different game type there are different ways to play and win. Below are some of the current available game modes:<br/><br/>Chestego-WAR - A game which combines chess with stratego and the addition of dice. The board is 10x10 with special pawns which hide their identity from the opponent until being attacked or attacking. There is also two dice which are used when heroes attack each other (or when attacking the princess pawn). One with a square and one with a triangle. The triangle die is used by the defender while the square die is used by the attacker. The triangle die has a High chance of loosing while the square has a high chance of winning. The lowest number wins. A triangle rolled is a counterattack which kills the attacker. A Square rolled is a miss and the attacker has to move back to the space he attacked from. The game mode is won by killing the king.<br/><br/>Chestego-WARZ - a 2v2 WAR with the option for free for all if you have 2 more sets or colors or COOP with the standard set. In COOP one player controls the Warrior King while the other controls the Queen. The Warrior King can move up to 3 spaces in any direction so watch out. Also, the player with the King also gets the Assassin. The player with the Queen always get the Princess. The objective is still the same. In free for all there are 4 different colored armies.<br/><br/>Chestego-EDGE.LINE - Players build edges and lines and try to surround claimed dots to maximize points. There are 100 tiles and the possibility to play between 2-6 players. More players can be added with combined games. The game starts off with players building the Rift 1 piece at a time. The Rift has some starting edges and lines which can be claimed(12 pieces). The remaining 88 pieces are played one at a time until all pieces are played. The player with the highest score wins. The soon to be release app will keep track of each players score. Anything which was not completed gets counted at the end.<br/><br/>Chestego-RIFT - Players rush to claim resources and towers to build up their forces to be able to attack the enemy. This can be played 1v1 or 2v2 coop. There are resources and outposts which can be built to speed up your attack and slow the attackers. Each side is working to establish their land and is preparing to travel across the Rift. You win by destroying the opponent(s) or forcing a surrender.<br/><br/>Chestego-JUMPS - 1v1 version of Checkers with some special pieces and a 10x10 board. With 15 Jumpers and 5 Leapers each side. Jumpers can only move forward and can only jump other jumpers. If a Jumper jumps two enemies he is promoted to a Leaper or if he gets to the back line. Leapers can only jump Leapers and Jumpers. There are 5 Leapers to start with which can be promoted to Vaulters if they jump two enemies in a row or get to the back line.Vaulters can jump two pieces right next to each other in a line. Any combination of friend and foe can be jumped. Vaulters can jump anything. If a Vaulter jumps a promoted Leaper he is demoted to a Jumper. The game is won by the player left standing.<br/><br/>Chestego-JUMPZ - a 4 player version of JUMPS. You will need two additional colors or you can play 2v2 and split the existing pieces into the four corners. Each player gets 2 Leapers and 6 Jumpers. For the Jumpers that have to attack straight ahead. All the remaining rules apply.<br/><br/>Chestego-NEF - a variation of the Viking board game Hnefatafl with a 9x9 board instead of 11x11 (11x11 could be done with the addition of more board pieces). This version has 3 different piece types instead of the original 2. There is the King which can more unlimited spaces in any straight line. The Valkyries which can also move orthogonally unlimited spaces and the Berserkers which also more the same way. To remove an enemy piece you have to surround it. For Valkyries 2 would have to surround another Valkyrie one on each side to remove it. To remove a Berserker you would have to surround it on four sides with Valkyries or two sides with Berserkers. The King has to always be surrounded on four sides to be removed. The King tries to move to one of the 4 corners where there is a King square that only he can occupy. There is also a King square in the center which only the King can occupy. A King square can be used to surround pieces.<br/><br/>Chestego-WUR - A variation of the ancient game UR. Players race to move their pieces from the starting area to the ending area. The board can be setup in two ways. One with a longer battle lane and the other one a shorter one. There are also 3 towers used. One for each player's color and one special tower. To move past the center you have to occupy your tower. Once a player is in the tower he is safe and is considered removed. The player can jump down to attack an enemy if he lands in the lane right next to the tower but then he becomes vulnerable to attacks. The game is won by the player who gets all of his or her pieces out first.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Combatants<br/><br/>(Les combattants) This is the story of the back alleys in the big cities, the grasslands at the outskirts of the rural areas, the field of the duel at dawn, the meetup of fighters in the park. The game of swashing blades, rivalling schools and swordplay and the bash of combatants in battle. You are the duelling gentlemen, the nobles, the privateers, the henchmen, the thugs and fighters of the streets. Trying to defend your honour, prove your loyalty, do your master&rsquo;s biddings or just to survive. Pick up your sword and roll your dice.<br/><br/>This is the narrative of duelling. Duelling in the sense of swordmasters, fighting styles, sunset duelling and honour. You are a fighter with a specific style and your school. Combat is both luck and skill.<br/><br/>Manage your opportunities and movement, and you will come out on top. Whittle down your opponent's stamina in order to score hits, chase your opponent away from the battle, knock your opponent out and win the duel.<br/><br/> Base concept <br/><br/>Combatants in a melee or a duel are constantly manoeuvring, in and out of each other's range, accelerating, slowing down, changing directions. Swordplay is like a dance in that you are moving and responding to your opponents, but you also try to outsmart them and to hit them or to keep them far away. The combat, distance, and turn order in this game is an abstraction. There is no fixed amount of time per round or turn, nor a fixed distance between players. The aim of this game is to both be a tool in a narrative and like a game of duelling, you would even be able to play this as a regular board game, player versus player, teams versus teams or in a Battle Royal style.<br/><br/> Gameplay <br/><br/>In this game of duelling, your goal is to knock out or chase your opponent away from the battleground. Various stories may drastically change winning conditions and combat is not always the answer. But this time and in this story, it will solely be a story about the duels.<br/><br/>Once each turn, players will simultaneously roll several six-sided dice and allocate these as the attack, defence and action values. One selected die, and in addition to this, dice combinations will give a final combat value. To aid you during gameplay there will be cards displayed as a playerboard, to visualize and present your decisions, both to yourself and other players.<br/><br/>Each combatant will have a combat skill level and each skill level will gain you one combat die to roll. The combat skill will range between zero and nine and the most common level is between two and four. In addition to this, there may be bonus dies, and sometimes dice are removed from play or temporarily locked down.<br/><br/>Independent of how many dice you roll, only ONE of the combat dice is chosen and with its full value be used as the base combat value. The rest of the dice will be used in dice combinations, to either increase this base value or be used for actions. When you choose to perform any one of the various actions instead of, or at the same time as your general melee, dice will be used for action quality instead of as part of the final combat result.<br/><br/>The combat value is used both as your chance to avoid being struck by ANY opponents and as your chance to land a blow at ONE opponent. These values are compared between players to see who succeeds. The difference between values is the quality of the blow, and are used for fatigue and damage.<br/><br/>When a combatant is attacked by several opponents, the combatant&rsquo;s combat result will count as the defence value against them all, fully or partially lowering potential damage, regardless of it is a successful or failed onfall against any of the opponents.<br/><br/>If you are up against and is attacking several potential opponents, you have to declare who is your main target, as you could only have one main opponent each turn. As a combatant is attacking for damage, gets a higher result, and thereby succeeds with the onfall against one, lower this opponent's stamina by the difference between the two results minus any penalty from distance. Turn order and actions may interfere with the attack, distance and protection may change the level of fatigue and damage.<br/><br/>To be used as fatigue and damage level trackers, there will be three blue health dies placed on your character card. As your combatant gets hit, reduce the value on the health dies one at the time, equal to the quality of the blow. Starting with the topmost die, continuing until the whole value is accounted for. The difference between combat values are the quality of a blow.<br/><br/>As soon as a die is down to zero you remove it. A removed die will reveal a penalty written on your character card. The values of these health dies will differ between characters and are based on a combatants&rsquo; constitution. Your combattant will be knocked out if all of your three health dice are removed.<br/><br/>At the beginning of every new turn, you reroll all of your available unlocked combat and bonus dice. Change your turn order. You allocate your dice as combat value and dice combinations. Priority of placed dice, onfalls, defences and actions are resolved in an order determined by a cycling sequence of timeslots. These timeslot sequences are determined by fighting styles and timeslot positions range between one to nine. Higher timeslot number is later in the turn.<br/><br/>Each fighting style sequence does not consist of all available timeslot positions, only a few and it varies between styles. You may voluntarily choose to act later within your own fighting style sequence for a bonus; as recovering stamina or focus and gaining additional combat dice.<br/><br/>There is no death in this game if you not specifically choose to incorporate this. If you want to tell a more deadly story, you may allow for serious consequences, as permanent injuries, maiming and coup de gr&acirc;ce.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>-Quotes<br/><br/>Inigo Montoya wrote:<br/>My name is Inigo Montoya.

The aim is to collect (or rob!) as much nectar as you can before winter arrives, while avoiding bears, beekeepers and other pests.<br/><br/>This game is designed to play as competitively or cooperatively as you choose, when playing with children you can choose to not rob their hives and hold onto your cards, or you may like to target the older players, those who are getting ahead, or your husband / wife.<br/><br/>There are 3 ways to play the game:<br/>1. Child&rsquo;s Play 15-30min<br/> For younger children, 6-10yrs <br/>A simpler version of the game without drones, complicated dice rules etc <br/><br/>2. Standard Game  60-90min<br/>Adults and kids 10yrs+, play until the first beehive is full.<br/>Good for beginners and introduces strategy. Drones are rarely used .<br/><br/>3. Extended Game 90-120min<br/>Adults and kids 12yrs+, play until all nectar &amp; pollen taken from board.<br/>Much more strategic, drones are used extensively to steal from each others hives<br/><br/>A aesthetically pleasing game which focuses on touch and feel, with wooden hexagon laser-cut tiles, printed cotton cloth for the board and unique clay bees.<br/><br/>Rules closely mimic how a bee colony actually works and players naturally learn bee &lsquo;rules&rsquo; such as how far bees will forage (5km), using the waggle dance to tell other bees where the best nectar is located (waggle wheel spinner), and rob weaker hives in autumn (hero or hazard cards).<br/><br/>",

West of Elsenborn Ridge, near the cities of Li&egrave;ge and Spa, Belgium, was a vast array of Allied supplies and the well-developed road network leading to the Meuse River and Antwerp. The Germans planned on using two key rollbahns or routes through the area to seize Antwerp and force a separate peace with the United States and Britain. Capturing Monschau and the nearby village of H&ouml;fen, and the twin villages of Rocherath-Krinkelt just east of Elsenborn Ridge, were key to the success of the German plans, and Hitler committed his best armored units and infantry troops to the area, including the 12th SS Panzer Division Hitlerjugend.<br/><br/>The green, untested troops of the 99th Infantry Division had been placed in the sector during mid-November because the Allies thought it was an area unlikely to see battle. Their soldiers were stretched thin over a 22-mile front, and all three regiments were on line, with no reserve. In early December, the 2nd Infantry Division was assigned to capture a vital crossroads marked by a customs house and a forester&rsquo;s lodge named Wahlerscheid, at the southern tip of the Battle of H&uuml;rtgen Forest. They transitioned through the 99th division's lines and after a deadly, costly battle, capturing the crossroads. But the Germans counterattacked in what the Americans initially thought was a localized spoiling action, but was actually a leading element of the Battle of the Bulge. The 2nd ID consolidated their lines, pulling back into H&uuml;nningen, and then to the twin villages of Rocherath-Krinkelt, and finally at the dug-in positions held by the 99th ID at Elsenborn Ridge.<br/><br/>What you get in ATS Battle of the Twin Villages:<br/><br/>ALL the combat counters you need to play<br/>New, large-hex winterized map for the historical battlefield<br/>Color Battlefield Walkaround rules in 3-hole format<br/>Color scenario format, bloody warm red you know the drill!<br/>Monster scenario to tie it all together without all that ordering from a Chinese restaurant menu &gt; they were there, you plop them down and get rolling!<br/>AFV Cards for all the AFVs in the module<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

They can explore the seas and new lands, establish trade routes with foreign villages, gain influence in government through bribes, fight naval battles, trade shares of stock in maritime and colonial companies, engage in piracy, and invest in government and company bonds. They will also compete in score with 3 NPC factions: the mainland Europeans, the moneylenders, and the natives.<br/><br/>SHARES OF STOCK<br/>The stock market system is pretty standard. Companies have 10 shares each and the player that owns the most shares controls the company. However, share price is not impacted by buys and sells, but only value of the company. One key difference in this to most stock market games is that not only can players own shares of stock in companies, but other companies and governments can own shares of stock as well. For example, if a government owns majority of shares in a company the player that controls that government then manages the company. A key difference compared to most other shareholding games is that the company can require shareholders to contribute further funds if the company is low on money. This was often the case in the early days of shareholding.<br/><br/>COMPANIES<br/>Companies can build trading vessels that allow them to explore the sea and try to find overseas villages to trade with. They can also buy bonds released by governments or other companies. They can also build factories (old term for trading posts) in newly discovered lands as well as explore land. Companies do not start with any money, so they need to raise investments from players, governments, and other companies (or borrow from the moneylenders).<br/><br/>PORT CITIES (GOVERNMENTS)<br/>Port cities are controlled by a magistrate. Players can become magistrates by bribing to gain prestige in the port city. Port cities are able to construct warships. Magistrates can also decide which companies can build vessels in their port city, as well as determine any tax on incoming trade brought by trading vessels. Magistrates can also ban the moneylenders to forgive all debt related to the magistrate, but this will make the moneylenders unavailable for the rest of the game to them.<br/><br/>EXPLORATION<br/>The map is almost completely undiscovered, and as players move their watercraft into unknown territory 1 of 3 things can happen, 1: they discover empty water 2: they discover land, sometimes with a native village and sometimes with out 3: they run encounter a storm and sink. As all this happens map tiles are placed.<br/><br/>MONEYLENDERS<br/>The moneylenders are the international banking community and are extremely important in the game. Players and governments start out with very limited funds, so the moneylenders are almost always needed. This mechanism is unique, and different than almost all other banking systems in games. The moneylenders themselves have limited funds, but practice fractional reserve banking. This means they lend out more money than they have, so it is possible that they will go under if other entities are unable or refuse to pay debts.<br/><br/>COMBAT<br/>Combat in the game is simple and based on dice rolls. Players can go to war with each other and the natives. Cargo and other watercraft can also sometimes be seized.<br/><br/>BONDS<br/>Governments and companies can issue bonds to raise funds. Companies, players, and governments can invest in these.<br/><br/>MAINLAND POWER<br/>At the beginning of each turn the mainland power may attack a random port city. The mainland power represents mainland Europe. Tribute can be paid to avoid a possible attack. The mainland power may become powerful, but can also be reduced to nothing.<br/><br/>TRADE<br/>The trading mechanism is simple, and is the main way to generate wealth. Company vessels transfer numbers that represent cargo back and forth between overseas villages and port cities.<br/><br/>WINNING THE GAME<br/>The final score is based on the wealth of the player's family at the end of the game. The score of the mainland power, the moneylenders, the natives, and all ports and companies are also included. Players must attempt to get as much wealth in the hands of their family as possible, because at the end of the game the companies and ports they manage to contribute to their own score.<br/><br/>SOLO GAME<br/>The solo game is the same as the normal game. It is able to function as so because of the NPC entities that have a final score, it is not meant for serious gaming. Its main purpose is to get a player accustomed to the peculiarities of the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this Wild West town the stakes are high as every last one of you worthless lawbreakers are WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE for reckless and criminal behavior and are fugitives on the run. You must navigate the dangerous streets surrounding the Courthouse in order gather your posse together, escape capture and rule the town. Your posse of fugitives will attempt to round up reluctant and disloyal accomplices&mdash;trying to keep them in tow to accomplish their ill-conceived agendas. Beware, your accomplices can be taken from you at any moment, you may be hauled off to jail or even challenged to a duel.<br/><br/>The Wild West in 1879 was ripe with lawlessness. But in the vast Arizona wilderness the town of Prescott grew even wilder. A row of saloons cropped up and took over an entire street. They coined it &quot;Whiskey Row.&quot;<br/><br/>After much drinking and gambling, reckless and criminal behavior ensued. The townsfolk dueled it out with their six shooters on the dusty streets&mdash;each acting as judge and jury. The souls of those shot in cold blood haunted the town.<br/><br/>With opposing ill-conceived agendas, the townsfolk divided into four renegade posses and all became FUGITIVES of the law.<br/>The unruly CITIZENS,&nbsp;<br/>The dishonest MERCHANTS,&nbsp;<br/>The brutal OUTLAWS&nbsp;<br/>&amp; The corrupt local LAW.<br/><br/>2-8 players each use four real poker chip Wild West characters (their posse) to move around the board by choosing to play one of two 'wanted dead or alive' cards or roll two dice with an option of splitting the dice to move TWO characters. Each player has a posse of four. For instance, the Outlaws have the Gunslinger, the Madame, the Dealer and the Bartender. As they move through the streets of this dangerous town, strategic options are chosen to decide which of your opponents players you choose to force into being your reluctant accomplices by stacking them under your own posse's fugitives&mdash;you will need them to escape the law and win the game. The cards list a group of four wanted fugitives for a particular crime, so you may choose one from your own posse, OR one of your opponents, thereby giving you the chance to move an opponent's fugitive and waylay their attempts to win the game. Duels may be called before each turn in order to steal your opponents accomplices, kidnapping the Marshal or the Judge keeps you protected from capture and sending an opponent to the jailhouse or a haunted property slows down their ability to escape capture.<br/><br/>Although there are at least five strategic choices to choose from during each turn, the game moves along quickly. During another player's turn there is much to think about, so you are engaged the entire time. All players remain in the game until it concludes and there is no clear winner until it pans out in the end&mdash;with one player's posse escaping caputure by returning to their individual hideouts...with the help of their accomplices.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The original intended target audience was the expert gamers, but after heaps of blind tests, it seems to have a wider audience than expected (family+).<br/><br/>We believe the hooks of this game are the following:<br/><br/><br/>     Replay value: it's a rich, balanced and complex game, with many options of play<br/>     Intuitive and friendly: rules are quite easy to get, the prototype's design is catchy<br/>     Fun and cognitive: an area-control and economic game with dice, which is &quot;telling stories&quot;<br/><br/><br/>The project is two years old, and has been playtested over 250 times (private sessions, blind tests, game festivals, game bars..).

Peasants have newfound hope of escaping the rigid feudal social structure by embracing the path of the merchant. Through the acquisition of wealth and the expanding dependency on their goods, merchants could sometimes elevate themselves to occupy a distinguished position amidst the upper social hierarchy. Although the life of a merchant had its attractive sides, impediments such as war, weather and taxes all came as a counterpart to their ambitious course of life.<br/><br/>In Medieval Traders, you play the role of a peasant aspiring to become a wealthy merchant and escape the life of the hard-working laborer. The merchant that attains the most wealth and achievements, measured in victory points, is considered to be the winner. By buying resources common to one part of the known world and traveling to sell them in another or by fulfilling trade opportunities in various trade locations, players are able to distinguish themselves amongst their peers and amass the necessary funds to purchase assets of wealth and prestige. However be wary, as the travel routes are full of perils and the nobles will undoubtedly seek to collect their taxes and dues.

        "description": "'Zone Raiders is a fast-paced tabletop skirmish game where small groups of hardened survivors battle against each other in an unforgiving post-technological world called the Matroshka. Within an unending world of inscrutable science, radiation storms and machines dedicated to exterminating life, players create narrative stories and rewarding tactical gameplay in an open-model skirmish ruleset.<br/><br/>Distinct in our design is an emphasis on mobility, vertical space, and accomplishing asymmetrical objectives before escaping to safety. Your tactical decisions and smart positioning will decide every encounter with the enemy. The world itself is lethal, but can you adapt your strategy, characters and exotic weapons to meet the challenge against both other players, and solo/cooperative scenarios?<br/><br/>Combining inspirations from small-scale tabletop wargames, campaign skirmish games, RPGs and tactical turn-based video games, Zone Raiders is a fusion of what we love best about all of these.<br/><br/>We wanted to strike the right chord between tactical depth of play, narrative campaigns and character development along with a commitment to streamlined rules while maintaining sophistication. Combined with a stunningly alien scifi setting that is vast enough to encompass many themes as a player's imagination can conjure, it's a game meant to scratch an itch we've felt for ages.<br/><br/>Or on a more direct note Have you ever wanted to play a game where you could...<br/><br/><br/>     Grappling Hook to tall ledges, snipe foes, then dive to safety?<br/>     Wallrun up a steep slope, and kick a bad guy over a railing to their doom?<br/>     Fight AI Monsters issuing from an automated factory, then lure them into a nest of explosive barrels before blowing the lot up?<br/>     Open an cryo-vault to rescue an ancient survivor with lost knowledge?<br/>     Project force-field bridges across vast gaps, only to turn them off when foes set foot on them?<br/>     Combine versus and cooperative play into a single ruleset, with stealth and objective focused mechanics?<br/><br/><br/>All of these are within the domain of Zone Raiders.<br/><br/>We are an Open-Model game, meaning that the rules and setting are designed for what miniatures you may have and adore. There's numerous fantastic manufacturers out there, and many of us certainly have collections ourselves. Additionally, creating your own group and their stories is all the easier as inspiration can be drawn from all the beautiful models our greater gaming community has created.<br/><br/>Game Features<br/><br/>Zone Raiders has a mixture of elements veteran players will both feel familiar with, and refreshed by. In our ruleset, you will find:<br/><br/><br/>      Rich, Easy to Learn Rules - Combine easy to learn core gameplay with mechanics that reward tactical positioning, maneuver, and applied firepower to outfox your opponents. Practical rule design ensures that no decision is without appropriate consequence.<br/>      Tactical Team Skirmish - Build a Raid Team of 6-12 hardened survivors in your quest to endure. Equip each one with different weapons and specialized skills and watch them grow... or die.<br/>      Dynamic Movement - Feel the mobility of our unique Dynamic Movement system, where your Raiders can be equipped to parkour, wallrun, grapple or powered vault across broken terrain and lethal gaps. Smash opponents off tall ledges, or create forcefield walls to trap them in place!<br/>      Deadly Environments - Your opponent is not the only threat on the battlefield. Protecting ancient relics and scavenge are automated exterminator machines, psionic mind-scorchers, fierce nano-contaminant storms and radiation fluxes. When the lights vanish or unexpected snipers arise during a Dark Emergence Event, can your forces adapt?<br/>      Diverse Factions - Command 7 unique factions with engaging playstyles, from the regimented Reclaimers, the agile Technomads, cunning Zone Stalkers to the evolving robotic NthGen, each force is dripping with flavor and tactical options as well as unique researchable doctrines and equipment.<br/>      Campaign System - Lead your team beyond a single battle, but to victory in a campaign where your strategic decisions have great importance. Will you build up your team's tech skills, or abort the mission to retrieve an ancient cryopod? Should your team construct a mighty industrial robot, or develop maps of the battleground for a tactical edge? <br/>      Asymmetric Missions - Winning a battle isn't the same as winning a war. Players can elect  different goals during a mission, from capturing prisoners to hacking an automated train. Perhaps it's worth it to cut your losses during a failed mission, or even change objectives mid game as a new, more valuable prize is discovered!<br/>      Exotic Equipment - Featuring over 100 different types of weapons, armor and survival gear, you will have numerous options on how to equip and defeat your foes. <br/>      Merciless AI Enemies - The Immunocytes are merciless machines that are anathema to all intelligent life. Destroy or outmaneuver their AI-controlled agents during battle, or perhaps even trick them to tie up your opponents!<br/>      Cooperative Play System - Sometimes the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Join forces with other players to take on thrilling Cooperative Missions, where you must employ speed and stealth to defeat overwhelming numbers of AI foes to accomplish cinematic objectives as either single missions or campaign play.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Paradise Revolution is a four player strategy tabletop game inspired by the classic strategy games of the past like Risk, Axis and Allies, and Diplomacy featuring a Cold War theme and Latin American aesthetic this game aims to create a fun, intense, and thrilling experience for all players. This game can last for one to five hours, and is build to be easy-to-learn and hard to master, i.e. deep enough gameplay to entertain tabletop strategy veterans while being easy to pick up for new players.<br/><br/>The setting of the game is Santa Maria, a fictional Caribbean island that is at the center of a proxy conflict between the great powers. Play as one of four factions, the Communists, Fascists, Liberals, or Socialists, and take over the island to form it in your desired image.<br/><br/>This game was created out of passion and love for classic strategy board games, as well as the creators' keen interest in Cold War history and the history and culture of Latin America. Backing is needed to pay for manufacturing and distribution of the game.<br/><br/>How to play<br/><br/>Leader Cards<br/><br/>Each faction controls a portion of the island at the start of the game. Each player picks a leader from their faction, which grants a special ability that can shape a player's strategy. This can range from directly stealing your opponent's resources, sabotaging your opponent's plans through espionage, aggressively pushing into enemy territory, out-producing your opponent, and more.<br/><br/>Every leader offers a completely unique strategy. In general, fascist leaders focus on building and keeping early momentum, socialist leaders seek to outlast their opponents, communist leaders focus on espionage and sabotage, and liberal leaders focus on resource production and management.<br/><br/>The Map<br/><br/>Every state on the board has two resource values: Capital and Manpower. Each turn you can choose to either add your states' resources to your resource pool, or use your current resource pool to build partisans, the game's combat unit. States with a combined resource value of five of more (3/2, for example), are considered &quot;urban&quot; while the rest are considered &quot;non-urban.&quot; Controlling all urban states or controlling four urban states while having five action cards in your hand will win you the game.<br/><br/>Action Cards<br/><br/>These cards grant you bonuses or can be used to weaken your foes. They can take many forms, such as passive bonuses, combat buffs, free resources, and more. Action cards can be acquired in two ways. You can draw action cards once per turn, or you can pay 15 capital to spy on an opponent, meaning they must show you their hand, then choose an action card and give it to you. This is a very powerful ability, because not only does it give you a potentially game-changing boost, it can take one away from your opponents as well.<br/><br/>Action cards, with a few exceptions, can be played at any time, including during an opponent's turn. That opponent who just attacked you with 4 partisans? You can target him with an action card and destroy three of them. Make sure not to spend all your capital on spying, because certain extra-powerful action cards require you to pay capital in order to play them.<br/><br/>Combat<br/><br/>The combat in this game is similar to that in Risk and other classic war-games. The attacker rolls up to three dice for each attacking unit, while the defender rolls up to two and has an advantage on ties. If combat is going unexpectedly poorly due to a surprise action card or a streak of unending poor rolls, you can choose to retreat, roll a die, and escape safely if you roll a three or higher. If you roll lower, one of your partisans is destroyed.<br/><br/>Actions<br/><br/>Players receive three actions per turn. These include things like invading enemy states, making truces, drawing cards, and spying. Actions are important because they add a new layer of strategy to the game, making it easier to punish an opponent's strategic error, adding new depth to plan around, and more.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The knowledge about the mythos can be learnt reading rare arcane books and the magical power can be increased to cast more powerful spells, but also the sanity of the character played will lose sanity progressively, leading to schizofrenia, agorafobia and other terrible effects.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to make the life points of the opponent reach zero. From the deck, 5 cards are dealt to each of the players and one card from the hand can be played each round.<br/><br/>There are three ways damage can be inflicted, by using conventional fire arms, casting spells and summoning Mythos creatures. Creatures do not block direct attacks from the cards and they don&rsquo;t attack directly, instead they counterattack after your opponent has damaged you.<br/><br/>Cards involving the Chtuhu Mythos (spells and creatures) have a sanity cost which is listed as a number in the card.<br/><br/>Apart from the life points, there are four other parameters with a value that will change along the game: i) Elder sign, ii) Arcane power, iii) Taint of the yellow sign, and iv) Sanity.<br/><br/>i) Elder Sign is one defense against the Mythos effects. It can be increased through the use of certain cards. For each point you have, you will take 1 less damage from spell cards and monsters.<br/><br/>ii) Arcane Power represents the magical power gained by the knowledge of the Mythos. Arcane Power can be increased through the use of certain cards such as reading Arcane books. For every point you have, you will deal one extra damage for all cards that show the symbol next to the damage number.<br/><br/>iii) Taint of the yellow sign is a magical curse that can be inflicted using certain cards. Its effect is that for every tainted point you have, you will take one damage at the end of your turn. The only way to purge yourself of the taint is to use certain cards.<br/><br/>iv) Sanity: cards related to the Mythos cost sanity points to use. Sanity is the cost for delving into de Mythos and some cards cost zero due them not being of an occult nature. If your sanity reaches zero you will be insane. There are various types of insanity effects, and one of them will be applied randomly:<br/><br/>     Schizophrenia: At the end of each turn, Elder Sign and Arcane Power go to zero.<br/>     Megalomania: At the end of each turn, add +2 Arcane and + 4 Taint.<br/>     Xenophobia: your summon cards have no effect.<br/>     Agoraphobia: you can only have 2 cards in your hand. Remove randomly any excess cards from your hand.<br/><br/><br/>",

Magnes Omni is an unpredictable and addictive wooden handmade pyrography board game, where players use a mechanism of time dilation, in order to control the momentum of the devastation of a strange civilization. The game is a unique handmade, wooden crafted, strategy board game. Each copy of the game has the same mechanism of time dilation to play it, but is designed with a different unique art style and has its' own serial number. The new edition of the game board,  book box, and game pieces Glow in the Dark.<br/><br/>In a dystopian future, a wooden book with a mechanism was found, buried in the sand of the Greek Island of Santorini. The scientists discovered that the mechanism depicted a high dimensional map encoded in 9D quasicrystal, a pixelated scale reality of a multiple quantum universe of a world in the past. A civilization where time has stopped, with Cities that function with gravity, and magnetic forces. Mechanisms control the dimension of time and quantum technology is used to teleport among the cities. The quantum (plural quanta) is a discrete packet of energy with wave-like properties. An earthquake on the island from the distortion of the geomagnetic field in this strange and different world would cause the sudden disappearance of this advanced civilization.<br/><br/>Magnes Omni is a mechanism that works with time dilation between present and past, with electrons linked with, army, magnetism, and time as resources, that teleport to the past where time has stopped to control quantums.<br/><br/>Through its masterful blend of science and strategy, the game represents a magnificent quest: Are we stuck in a single definite state or all multiple realities result in a single certain outcome? Play with time in a world where time has stopped, and control the momentum of the devastation of an unknown and strange civilization.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Dicey Crafting is a single player, dungeon crawling, dice rolling adventure game.<br/><br/>The gameplay consists of a deck of monsters that you must battle your way through to complete the game. You also have a weapon (how you attack) and a shield (your health) that are crafted out of dice. These gear pieces lose durability (the number decreases on them) as you attack enemies and they attack you. As a gear piece wears out you can 'mine' dice from a dice mine, roll them, and re-craft your weapon.<br/><br/>Game time is between 30 to 45 mins. You can build the monster deck smaller for a shorter game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

There are 72 cards, of which 12 are surprise cards. These can be pleasant or unpleasant, as happens in daily life. The key to the game lies within the cards.  In the first actions they reflect our feelings, thoughts and actions. To bet or not to bet, that is the question. Therefore, we must bet, or not, on how much of our life, &lsquo;cronos&rsquo;, we are willing to risk.  20 &lsquo;cronos&rsquo; coins are allocated to each player.  As the game unfolds we find &lsquo;wings&rsquo;, that satisfy our needs, or &lsquo;weights&rsquo;, that drag us down and away from them.  We also see through our decisions that the &lsquo;suns&rsquo; we contribute to the common good begin to shine, and by contrast, the &lsquo;poisons&rsquo; of our bad choices begin to erode life.  And for that life to continue, if there are poisons in the common good the game cannot be won, even if the nine needs are satisfied. So, the underlying philosophy is that winning is about not harming others: live and let live.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

But you have little to go on, save the accidental drowning death of a local manager, and the word that witnesses are missing...<br/><br/>Sunset at Silver Creek is a complete programmed adventure set in the American West for solitaire or group play. The game includes an adventure booklet, game rules and playing pieces used to resolve the gun fights fought on the game map (also included).  It is the second in the Legends of the Untamed West series which uses a similar game system to Dark City Games' Legends of the Ancient World, which is based on the Fantasy Trip game system.<br/><br/>",

Of course, only the team of 5 Teenage Morphing Superheroes can stand on its way!

When all cards are revealed, collectively they must beat the correct type of attack that the monster is threatening with.<br/><br/>Instead of fighting, players may play &quot;selfie&quot; cards. That way, a player is slacking in combat but will earn him a victory point.

The map covers the area from approximately el Algheila in the west to just east of el Alamein in the east, aka 'the Western Desert'. The time period allows a start when the Italians invade Egypt in September, 1940, and ends December, 1942, when the Axis were driven out of Cyrenaica. The game has 2 months turns and use larger counters, 5/8th of inch, a full campaign should take between 10 to 14 hours.<br/><br/>Sandstorm is a 2-player game on the North African campaign with the recommendation to begin play when the German intervened in March 1941. However, one may start as early as September, 1940; albeit subject to Mussolini&rsquo;s directive to invade Egypt, amongst other starting dates. The campaign game ends when the Axis were driven out of the &lsquo;western desert,&rsquo; Cyrenaica and Egypt, December, 1942; other ending date may be selected. Players assume the role of the ground commanders trying to outperform their historical counterparts with the focus on the operational aspects. You plan and execute the sweeping maneuverers or head-first assaults. You have to make some of the same choices, do you press ahead in the hopes of a quick victory or pause to establish your line of supply? <br/>You will be bedeviled by the same problems, supply, the need to rest and refit, terrain, and, sometimes, your own superiors. Victory is achieved by eliminating the other player&rsquo;s units from the region, delaying the opponent&rsquo;s advance, or inflicting more casualties and taking few casualties than historically occurred.<br/><br/>A design aspect is toward playability in a reasonable table space within a manageable time commitment. The game map is 22&rdquo; by 48,&rdquo; at a scale of 12.5 miles or 20 kilometers per hex and encompasses the territory from the border between Cyrenaica and Tripolitania, Libya, in the west to just east of el Algheila, near the outskirts of Alexandria. Each game turn represents 2 months of calendar time. Unit sizes are generally regiments for the Axis and brigades for the Allies. An 11 turn campaign, from Mar/Apr 41 to Dec 41, game takes between 8 to 12 hours.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The conflict is better known as the Winter War as it happened during an extraordinarily cold winter.<br/><br/>The game emphasizes military operations on a strategic level using block game pieces to obscure the information on the block labels to simulate the fog of war.<br/><br/>The game also has a political layer to reproduce the international atmosphere as the eyes of the world were fixed on the war. Both nations must keep an eye on their Morale status as if it falters, it may hinder their number of actions per turn.<br/><br/>In addition, Finland has to manage its dwindling resources as it was not prepared for a full scale Soviet offensive after just a few decades after the nation gained its independence and fought a civil war. The Soviet military on the other hand was not prepared to encounter such fierce resistance and to fight in such harsh weather and terrain. The Soviet Union has to reform its military to readjust to these matters.<br/><br/>The game revolves around two unique 45 card command decks, one for each player. Each command card has an event and command point value to activate units and perform strategic actions. Both players also have two special unique decks of 5 cards to represent the international support for Finland and the reformed military approach for the Soviet Union. Both special decks contain what-if scenarios in addition to historical course of events.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

In order to collect a treasure you need to create a set of one or more spirits that can match with all the elements on the treasure.<br/><br/>However, you may not be able to collect any of the treasures initially exposed. In that case you can swap the exposed treasures or peek at and rearrange the deck, but these both require more demanding combinations of elements.<br/><br/>You win if you can get all seven treasures, but you lose if you're stuck without any legal actions.

Use Copy Cats and Dog Catchers wisely to outwit and defeat your opponents.<br/><br/>Players will have dog cards, which they may play in combinations, and Power Dogs, which they may also play in combinations. There are also Copy Cats, which are essentially wild cards and Dog Catchers, which immediately send all dogs to the Dog Pound, which is where all the cards that were completed from the Dogpile go. The cards in the Dog Pound will not be used until the round is over and a new round begins.<br/> The first player places a card or combinations of cards on the Dogpile, which is the pile of played cards in the middle of the table. Play then continues to the left. During your turn, you can play a card or a combination of cards that are of higher value than the last played. However, your turn can be taken away if a Completion occurs by another player before the player whose turn it is can play a card. A completion occurs when there are 4 of the same type of cards on the Dogpile. Completions can be played out of turn regardless of how many cards are being played on the Dogpile. The same type of cards can be stacked to increase the value of the Dogpile. For example, you can Stack a single card on a double if they are of the same type. If a player can not play on the Dogpile, that player has to draw from the Dog House (Draw Deck) until they can play.<br/><br/>The first person to run out of cards in the round wins the round, and the first person to win 3 rounds is the Top Dog.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A true game of strategy that will add excitement to any festive gathering.<br/><br/>The game of 63 has its origins in Bhutan, the Land of the Thunder Dragon.  This ancient kingdom, nestled between Tibet, India and Nepal, is a place out of time where traditional life thrives in the shadow of the world's greatest mountain range.  Deep in the isolated Himalayan Mountains, it is not uncommon for the mountain village men to huddle together to play this game.<br/><br/>They mark out 63 spots using twigs forming a roughly circular playing area.  Each player gathers their own set of distinctive tokens from what's available around them.  They use blades of grass, plant stems, stones and sticks of different sizes and anything else they can easily find.<br/><br/>The dice are made from yak bone.  Each player takes their turn, shaking the dice in a small hardened leather bowl and slamming it down in the centre of the board.  The game is played with great enthusiasm and often the outcomes are gambled on.  It is a timeless game of opportunity, luck, and strategy from one of the last timeless places left on Earth.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

They demand the release of several of their members from prison before they let her go.  An informant has told the authorities where she is located and the FBI&rsquo;s Special Weapons and Tactics team has been ordered to rescue her and bring the terrorists to justice.  Little do they know, but the media has tipped off the terrorists and they have a surprise waiting for the S.W.A.T. Team.<br/><br/>In this game, the terrorists setup by placing the hostage in a building with two guards.  They then write down where their hidden sniper and mine will be placed. After this, they roll to see how many terrorist rifleman they will have and place them on the map.  The sniper is a hidden unit and is not placed on the map until he fires or a unit moves adjacent to him.<br/><br/>The S.W.A.T. forces initially enter in truck from the West and East end of the map.  During their first turn one of their trucks will run over the hidden mine and the truck will be destroyed and the occupants must roll saves to see if they survive.  The S.W.A.T. forces have one additional unit that can enter on any turn in a helicopter.  If the helicopter lands adjacent to any terrorist unit (including the hidden sniper) it will be shot down.<br/><br/>During the game, the S.W.A.T. forces will battle the terrorists and possibly try to arrest some of them.  Arrest attempts are dangerous and the S.W.A.T. unit can be killed in the process.  Once the S.W.A.T. team eliminates any terrorists guards holding the hostage, they can move in and take control of her.  They then need to transport her off map either on foot, in a truck or with the helicopter.<br/><br/>The game ends when either the hostage is rescued or all the S.W.A.T. team members are killed.  Victory points are then calculated to see which side won and what level of victory they achieved.<br/><br/>This game is designed for 2 players, but plays fairly well solitaire.  Most games last around 25 minutes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this cooperative game, players belong to a gang of outlaws that wants to rob a train before it reaches the mountain tunnel. In order to do so, each outlaw must bring three items needed for the robbery. To keep their dastardly plan a secret, however, the gang can only communicate with each other via Morse Code.<br/><br/>Each player receives three item cards; these are the items that they need to bring to the gang's hideout. The train's initial distance to the tunnel is determined by the sum value of all players' cards.<br/><br/>During their turn, each player rolls the four 'transmission' dice, using the resulting Morse Code dot/dash combination to form one or more letters of items on the map. Once an item's word has been spelt, any player needing that item can go to that locale and take it, immediately gaining its benefit.<br/><br/>Whenever a player moves from one locale to another on the map, or is unable to use all four of the transmission dice, the train moves one click closer to the tunnel. If the odometer on the train reaches zero before all the outlaws arrive in the hideout with their three items, it escapes! The gang also has to contend with a troublesome Sheriff, who puts outlaws in jail, and Indians who will barter for items before you can get them!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

(In this case, an Alcubierre design.)  Mankind expands outward in every direction, for 3000 light years, in the next 700 years.<br/><br/>It is now the year 3000 AD, and after a little less than 700 years of FTL technology, man has created a modest sphere of inhabited systems some 6000 light years in diameter, and a collective population nearing 1 trillion souls.  Many, many systems containing habitable worlds still remain to be explored and colonized within that sphere, yet the expansion relentlessly continues.   A few, planet-bound sapient races have been found, but no other race with space travel (much less FTL capability) has yet to be revealed.<br/><br/>But the Milky Way galaxy is a vast expanse of hundreds of billions of stars, and despite centuries of FTL drives, man has still only seen the smallest fraction of a single percentage point of those star systems.<br/><br/>Much, much more lies out there, not the least of which is other, star-faring races.  And of those, some are hopefully friendly and open-armed (in some cases, figuratively), some likely paranoid beyond reason, some simply convinced that any species other than their own must be eradicated, but most will likely fall in various places across the spectrum of possibilities.  The diplomatic skills of man will be sorely tested, as may his ability and will to wage interstellar warfare.<br/><br/>Fourth Millennium is a 4X game for 1 to 6 players, set on a map of the entire Milky Way galaxy &ndash; 100,000 light years in diameter &ndash; where each player will choose their own path in attempting to carve out the biggest and best empire, encountering a variety of 36, possible alien races, each with its own unique attributes, attitude, and aspirations, not to mention the empires being built by the other players.<br/><br/>Staying relevant technologically will prove a challenge.  Some alien races you encounter may be more advanced than you&hellip;and not happy about your presence on their doorstep.  Indeed, you may even need to ally with other players in order to whittle down a common threat.<br/><br/>And during your explorations, you may find multiple artifacts, left behind by a long-gone race.  They are key to understanding new technologies and improving you overall civilization.  But be forewarned. Those who left behind these artifacts - which we call &quot;The Andromedans&quot; - are still observing, may decide to intervene, and if so, with the sole intent of destroying all, competing star-faring races.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each player tries to become the most glorious one by accomplishing missions, obtaining money and equipment cards, recruiting the crew and enlarging the vessel. Other actions as trading, exploring new islands and plundering other captains, can be accomplished to get more power.  By doing so, and by attacking other players, the captain obtains &ldquo;fame points&rdquo;, which eventually lead to victory and eternal glory.<br/><br/>Thanks to the 11 mixable components, each board will be different from the other. The panel combinations are more than 30 mln, allowing the best gaming experience. By merging the components the &ldquo;game world&rdquo;, with islands and seas, gets its shape.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, each glorious sailor gets a basic ship and an unskilled crew.  To each one  is randomly given a specific ability as well as the ship details. These are: speed (how far can this vessel go), maneuverability (crew members needed to move), holds (how many goods can the ship carry), cannons (to attack other ships). Finally there are 5 seats for the brave crew.<br/><br/>Before each round, the first player draws a &ldquo;wind card&rdquo; out. This card decides the direction of the active flows. Moreover, it outlines the goods&rsquo; productions sites, events taking place in inhabited islands and prices&rsquo; variations. Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of two actions happening on inhabited islands. Those activities need to be chosen among: simple movement, entering the pub to recruit the squad, selling goods or buying a ship part. &ldquo;Free actions&rdquo; (healing, fixing, loading goods and one attack) are allowed as well on these islands. While, the only action allowed on an uninhabited island is the sole exploration.<br/><br/>The sea is calm, are you now ready to sail?<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

These treasures can be turned in for points to be added up at the end of the game, but hanging onto certain treasures can be helpful as you lose their abilities once they've been removed from your stomach.<br/><br/>More treasure cards are pulled from the deck and treasure tokens will continue to move across the board until all the tumble path cards have been discarded or made inactive. Once this happens, players will add up the value of all the treasure cards they've stashed, as well as any remaining Vomit Tokens (the goblin's currency), and whoever has the most points is the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

He will task you to repair the existing infrastructure, construct new buildings and help those in need. Manage your resources and complete these Quests to get Coins, but be careful!

Aim of the game is to be the first one to get 11 Coins. Coins will primarily be earned through quests, which will require resources such as Silk and Stone. Players will need to compete amongst themselves to gather such resources, considering their supply is limited and they have one action per turn. Excess resources can be traded at the Docks, or could be turned into Coins at the Grand Bazaar.<br/><br/>Heed the call of Sultan, and be the glorious merchant that restores Constantinople to new heights!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Will you be the first of your peers to bring your monstrous creation to life?  Dig up body parts from the village graveyard, buy items from the workshop, and gather the resources you need to finish your work and become the greatest scientific mind of the age.  With your faithful henchman at your side, anything is possible.  But beware!  The villagers are becoming restless.

Through strategic placement of your pawns, sometimes blocking other players or bumping them to adjacent locations, you collect the resources and body parts needed to bring your monster to life.  Once alive, your monster is an additional worker which you may place to gain resources or sacrifice on a rampage through the village to score additional victory points.  Players must take care to manage the anger of the villagers by controlling the mob meter, or else the villagers might riot.  The burgomeister pawn adds a unique element of placement control and timing, though his loyalty often shifts from player to player.  Items purchased at the village workshop boost the players&rsquo; abilities to gather resources, score victory points, rampage, or control areas of the board.  Each scientist has his own special abilities which augment game play for that particular player and offer numerous pathways to victory.

In the other area forms are laid. With the exception of the first stick, in the second area, sticks may only be laid at one end of a laying stick. So that both created an angle of 60, 90 or 180 degrees. It usually creates squares and equilateral triangles.<br/>A special feature of the game is that a player can also lay sticks in the opposing areas. If you have laid down a stick in the enemy area, which has an open side, you may only lay there again, if you can lay a stick there, which is then closed at both ends. If that does not work, you can only lay down sticks in your own area.<br/>When all the sticks have been laid, you can only lay sticks; never taking away the last laid wood. In the end, no stick may have an open end. <br/>The goal is to match the number of shapes (rectangles, parallelograms, trapezoids, and triangles) with the number of the Roman numeral.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Ludik Quebec Alice Board Game is a game of observation and speed for children 6 years and older. This game is designed with beautiful illustrations of the characters from the tale of Alice in Wonderland. The first player who finds the identical characters and exhausts all the cards in his deck as soon as possible wins the game! A simple and fun game that will appeal to your youngest!<br/><br/>Getting Ready: <br/><br/>     A player shuffles the cards ad separates them into two equal piles<br/>     Players sit in front of each other, take their pile of cards and put it face down in front of them<br/>     Using the discs they make two columns of four discs each face up, leaving a space between columns large enough to contain four cards side by side.<br/><br/><br/>Playing the game:<br/>The game goes on until one of the players plays out his entire pile of cards.<br/>Each turn is comprised of four steps, each one starting the same way<br/>Players count to three, take the top card of their own pile and put it simultaneously in front of their opponents turned card. <br/>As soon as their cards are turned, players must be quick to locate identical cards. If there are no identical cards on the playing area, players move to the next step.<br/><br/>When there are two identical cards on the playing area, the first player to hit the disc matching the character on them taes a card from his own pile and covers one of the identical cards.<br/>Players move on to the next step only when there are no identical cards on the playing area.<br/><br/>Note: Identical cards may be found in any column, not necessarily facing each other. In that case, players proceed in the same way. The player who is the quickest to hit the right disc covers one of the identical cards using a card from his own pile.<br/><br/>The first player to play the last card on his pile wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;user summary<br/><br/>",

Of boldly going where no one had gone before.<br/><br/>Captains like Garth, Alexander and Travis charted new worlds by the score, leading scientific and diplomatic missions to the edge of explored space. Following the examples of Magellan, Shackleton, and Lewis and Clark, they were scientists and idealists, dedicated to peaceful first contact whenever possible.<br/><br/>It was inevitable that they would run into a hostile power. Under the command of Kharn the Undying, the Empire saw humanity&rsquo;s peaceful ambitions as a mockery of its own greatness, its constant need to expand to maintain its cultural vitality.<br/><br/>Unprepared for hostile first contact, the human-led explorers and their underarmed fleet soon faced their greatest peril: an invasion orchestrated by a military genius.<br/><br/>Four years of warfare, ending in the Battle of Axanar, shaped everything that followed.<br/><br/>This product requires the Squadron Strike 2e Boxed Set (ADA 1700) to play!

Mostly, that&rsquo;s true &ndash; but still, there is a wise core in the events around token matches, something interesting to think about.<br/><br/>Powerful creatures, gods from various real-world mythologies feel a lack of humans&rsquo; faith. There are not so many people around the globe, who still believe in personalities from ancient legends. That faith is a kind of energy that keeps all those gods alive and supports their might. Getting more faith is the reason for the War of Gods to happen, so it takes place on the game board.<br/>Matches of this game happen on a hexagon board with many small internal hexagons to place playing pieces on.<br/><br/>Three players participate in one battle. The initial step for each of them is a potential sacrifice &ndash; players put a token to the central area, an altar. A winner of this match will be able to take all the tokens from the altar or to craft with them a new one.<br/><br/>To play the match, players get from their collections three tokens each. One by one, participants make their turns, placing a token to the entry point. These tokens are various creatures with three different battle actions. Each token can make a specific number of steps on the game board.<br/><br/>There are two ways to win a match in the Altar game:<br/><br/>by clearing the game board from all the other tokens &ndash; through battles with them.<br/>by surrounding the central hexagon (the altar) with a specific number of your tokens.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As the harvest approaches, the villagers gather and ponder the coming winter. Among them, darkness lurks, corrupting the town and its inhabitants. Unlikely allies will rise to either save this village or condemn it.<br/><br/>Can you make it through the lengthening nights and save the town? Or is something creeping up on you, disguised as a neighbor, waiting for its chance to BITE?<br/><br/>BITE is a social deduction game with secret roles for social gatherings. Players receive roles and pair up for a few minutes of conversation at a time, at the end of which each reveals an action card to the other player. They resolve these cards and move on to the next discussion, their motives changing throughout the game based upon which side they find themselves: Good or Evil. By the final night, either darkness will have been rooted out of the town, or it will have triumphed.<br/><br/>Each role has action cards associated with it that reveal information about their conversation partner, protect them from harm, convert them to their side, or kill them off in various ways. The roles are themed to a gothic fantasy setting including Witches, Hunters, Villagers, Occultists, Vampires and the like.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Thanks to Indian resentment over the French surrender of their lands and the harsh policies of General Jeffery Amherst, governor-general of British North America, 20+ Indian nations rose up under the charismatic leadership of the Ottawa sachem, Pontiac and the Lenape Holy Man, Neolin. When the powder-smoke cleared, 450 British soldiers and countless Indians had lost their lives. Two thousand settlers were either killed or captured and 4000 more had been displaced. Moreover, Britain&rsquo;s foreign conflicts had put the Crown 140 million &pound; in debt. These expenses led directly to a series of unpopular taxes in North America which in turn led directly to another uprising, our colonial revolution.<br/><br/>Pontiac&rsquo;s War attempts to recreate the reaction of Indian leaders to British mishandling of frontier politics and the impending colonial crisis it presaged. Building on the point-to-point system and loose Indian alliances used in King Philip&rsquo;s War and Blood on the Ohio, this design expands frontier conflict using Battle cards to introduce combat chaos, British expenditure on troops, Uncertain Indian Armssupply, siege rules, the capture of prisoners, French interference and trader influence.<br/><br/>The game offers five short introductory scenarios (15-30 minutes), three one-year campaign scenarios (2 hours), and one three-year grand campaign (5-6 hours). Although not a solitaire design, it is solitaire friendly. Players will appreciate the high-production quality of the components which includes a MOUNTED game map and large, 338 3/4&quot; size punch-out counters.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>Complexity: 4 out of 10<br/>Solitaire Suitability: 5 out of 10<br/>Time Scale: Seasonal turns (approx. 3 months per turn)<br/>Map Scale: Point-to-Point map (approx. 60-75 miles between points)<br/>Unit Scale: 30-50 men, 4-6 artillery guns, individual officers and sea vessels<br/>Players: 1 or 2 (best with 2)<br/>Playing Time: from 15 minutes (intro scenarios) to 6 hours (grand campaign)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The maps should be printed on 12 x 18 inch paper to produce an 11 x 17 inch map.***<br/><br/>Ambush at Rannugen depicts a never fought 1985 engagement in the Fulda Gap using Jim Day's and GMT&rsquo;s MBT Game pitting a reinforced US tank company team of the 1st Infantry Division (Forward) against a reinforced Warsaw Pact Motorized Rifle Battalion in Germany.<br/><br/>The scenario reflects my experience as a Company Commander in 1984-1985  The game explores a way to use terrain in a different manner to defeat the enemy.  In a conventional defense, the US establishes a killing zone by positioning on good terrain with frontal and flank shots to destroy the enemy once he enters the zone.  Here, the tactic is to position the US force in such a manner that he is rewarded with shots on the enemy's rear and flanks while at the same time perhaps avoiding some of the enemy's artillery bombardment.  The dicey part, however, is withdrawing and getting to a new position after finishing the engagement.<br/><br/>Like other scenarios I have released, it is not balanced although players may balance it as they deem fit.<br/><br/>To play the game, you must have a copy of the initial GMT MBT Game. The expansion includes 4 11 x 17 maps scaled at 100 meters per hex (the same scale as the MBT game), a Scenario Briefing, a US Battle Book and a Soviet Battle book with deployment instructions and order of battle listing, and a terrain key. The map is based on a period map of the battle area and utilizes contours to depict elevation.<br/><br/>Expansion sets are not required (BAOR, FRG, and the forthcoming Canadian supplement) provide additional vehicle counters as well as leaders. A list of substitute counters is provided to enable the player to field the complete order of battle for both sides or the players can use some of the expansion set vehicles or combine sets to complete the order of battle.<br/><br/>Rannugen can be played with two players but may be more interesting if played with up to 4 players on the US side (CO and the five platoon leaders), and 5 on the USSR side (Battalion Commander and 4 company commanders), and a referee.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Lovely promises of fortune and glory will bring you to deep forgotten catacombs, but only a true hero, with a body and mind forged in the strongest steel will survive.<br/><br/>Half role playing game, half figurine (1:50 scale) Catakombes Dark Reign is a cooperative game for 1 to 3 players embodying a group of heroes, who form an alliance against their opponents to accomplish their quest, while another player gives life to the adventure as the game master. The game takes place in an alternative medieval era, where legendary creatures and magic coexist with the real world.<br/><br/>Purpose of the game<br/>Incarnate a hero willing to over- come every risk to achieve the main quest.<br/>1/Setting up<br/>You need to define who the heroes (PC) are and who the Game Master (GM) is. We recommend a group of three adventurers PCs. The game master (GM) is in charge of animating the adventure for the PCs in the respect of the game&rsquo;s rules.<br/>The GM chooses a quest and prepares the &laquo; Catacombs&rsquo; plan &raquo; cards enables to create a unique gaming board for each game.<br/>Each PC chooses a character with the help of a predefined sheet or PCs create their own character if they wish.<br/>The introduction of the game takes place in a narrative way. The GM describes the quest to the PCs, who verbally describe their actions. Every conceivable actions are possible, it is up to the GM to adapt them to the game.<br/>When PCs enter the catacombs the game play is in turns.<br/>2/Game turn<br/>During a game turn, there is first the PCs&rsquo; turn then the GM&rsquo;s turn and each turn is divided into 3 phases.<br/>PC&rsquo;s turn :<br/>Phase 1: The characters recover all their action points (A.Point).<br/>Phase 2: One of the PC&rsquo;s (by turns) draw an unexpected card at the start of each turn (except in the first turn of the game) and the PCs suffer its effects. Take care of all the various effects affecting the PCs and their allies (Fear, Burning, Poisoned...), and remove expired markers.<br/>Phase 3: Each PC does his actions (walk, run, attack, search ...). Each time a PC does an action, he removes the equivalent action points as indicated by the action&rsquo;s cost. When a character is activated, they aren&rsquo;t obligated to spend all their action points in one go. For example, they may do one action then let another PC or ally play their actions and finish their actions afterwards. But once the PC&rsquo;s turn is over, all remaining action points are lost.<br/>GM&rsquo;s Turn:<br/>The GM repeats the 3 phases of a turn, like during the PCs&rsquo; turn (bare in mind that the GM doesn&rsquo;t draw an unexpected event card). The GM&rsquo;s characters play in the GM&rsquo;s desired order.<br/>3/End of the game<br/>The game ends when the main quest is completed or all PCs are eliminated.<br/>The GM then reads the conclusion of the quest and the PCs intervene verbally describe their actions.<br/>The PCs add up the experience points, Ecus earned and the treasures found during the game and share them equally.<br/>Then the PCs spend their experience points to develop their characteristics and gain new skills. They can go to town in order to buy new equipment with their hard-earned ecus.<br/><br/>- description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is set in a densely wooded yet populated area where forest fires often occur. When fires start, players work together to put them out and save houses and schools from destruction.<br/><br/>Players use several fire fighting approaches &ndash; bulldozers, water, helicopters and chemical extinguishers. Fires occur randomly (FOREST FIRE cards) and spread every turn. Wind changes direction and intensity frequently, affecting the spread of the fires. Players contain the fires with bulldozer firebreaks and throw water and fire extinguisher balls (fire retardant) on the fires by hand or from a helicopter.<br/><br/>As the game progresses, environmental factors like wind and drought increase, affecting the frequency, intensity, and spreading speed of fires, simulating the effects of climate change.<br/><br/>We noted the other game of the same name and same setting, but the play mechanics are very different. This is not a strategy game, but a fairly simple but exciting family game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players take on the roles of magic users as they embark on an all-out mystical battle for arcane dominance or simply petty vengeance.<br/><br/>Each turn, the players will use their hand of cards to cast a spell. A spell will usually be created from three cards (elements) in their hand, and placed face down ready for the casting phase. Players will have to act fast however as the quicker a player prepares their spell, the earlier they'll be able to cast it and inflict pain upon their opponents.<br/><br/>Once all casters have prepared their spells, they begin the process of flinging them at each other: In order of initiative, each player places a missile token on their caster then moves it around the arena, then deals damage and other harmful statuses to the target(s) depending on the spell's effects.<br/><br/>Casters that end up on the wrong side of a fireball need not fear, for death is merely an inconvenience! When their physical forms expire, casters explode in a burst of magical energy and become sentient slimes. In this form players cannot win the game, but killing a living caster will return them to life, allowing players a chance to snatch victory once more.<br/><br/>The game is won by the last caster to be left alive, so don your finest robes and hats and prepare your toughest spells... You'll need every advantage you can get to be the last Arcane Blaster Caster!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The goal is to grow your garden by placing a female plant card in front of you, face up so that all can see. To close a round simply put down 6 female plant cards in your garden, the person who grows the most plants wins the game. If you want a longer game simply tally points over three rounds.

        "description": "HMS Royal Sovereign was a 1st Rate Ship-of-the-Line of the Royal Navy, bearing 100 guns. She was launched from Plymouth Dockyard in 1786 and developed somewhat of a poor reputation from her crew, supposedly dubbed &quot;West Country Wagon&quot; owing to poor manoeuvrability and speed.<br/><br/>Prior to her famous role at the Battle of Trafalgar, she participated in the battles of &quot;The Glorious First of June&quot; as the flagship of Vice-Admiral Thomas Graves, and was Cornwallis' flagship in his famous retreat of 16 June 1795. In the latter battle, after a day's pursuit, a far larger French fleet came within firing range of the entire Brtish fleet.<br/><br/>Realising the danger to his rearguard, Cornwallis brought Royal Sovereign southwards imposing his vessel between the two fleets, using the power of the 1st rate's broadside to dissuade the pursuing French. In doing so, he managed to delay the French long enough until the appearance of an unknown fleet spooked the French into their own retreat.<br/><br/>In Game:<br/><br/>HMS Royal Sovereign is an exceptionally powerful 1st Rate in the game. Beware the brunt of her broadside, particularly if you choose to include Admiral Collingwood as a character in your fleet. His presence will allow his ship and friendly vessels near, to re-roll its initial broadside. This gives you a distinct advantage for this crucial portion of any battle.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Stitchcraft is a two-player strategy card game that plays in 15 to 20 minutes where players have the same deck of 40 cards, 5 copies each of 8 colored tapestries, and are racing to have 7 of the 8 colors face up on the table or 4 copies of one color face up on the table.<br/><br/>Stitchcraft won the Implementation of Simplicity award at CinCityCon&rsquo;s 2019 design contest for being easy to learn while retaining strategic depth.  Turns are composed of each player drawing a card and then taking two actions. An action can be either placing a tapestry from hand face down on the table OR taking a face down tapestry and flipping it face up, activating the power of that color. Each color has a unique effect based on the Pattern set chosen at the start of each game. If players ever get tired of one Pattern set they can simply change to a new Pattern for an entirely different play experience.

        "description": "The Spanish Navy was beset by mixed fortunes in the Age of Sail, achieving great victories and major defeats in an interesting balance. Particularly during the Napoleonic era, Spanish allegiances were subject to fluctuations, oftentimes at odds with the British, yet allying with them when the situation suited (such as their rejection of Napoleon in 1808 - even in the wake of Trafalgar in which a quarter of the Spanish Navy had been lost).<br/><br/>The Spanish Navy was the largest in the world at the outset of the 1700s, though this diminished to third-largest as the century wore on. Not only fighting close to home, the Spanish Navy fought engagements as far away as the Carribean and South America, where they achieved similarly mixed results.<br/><br/>Why sail the Spanish Navy?<br/><br/>When using the National Special Rules, the Spanish Navy allows you to bring a huge level of firepower in your fleets. Spanish 1st Rates are allowed to take the Over Gunned upgrade for free adding a heavy and a light cannon to each broadside. This is not without compromise, however, as these vessels need to successfully pass a test to travel at full sails, and can never be crewed by veterans. Additionally, veterans for other ships cost more in Spanish fleets.<br/><br/>This means that a Spanish Admiral will need to use extra cunning in the selection of vessels for their fleet, carefully selecting upgrades for the extremely powerful Over Gunned vessels, to offset the decreased manoeuvrability and penalty to hit. At the same time, enemy fleets will need to be extremely wary of exposing themselves to the initial broadside of a fully tooled-up Spanish 1st Rate.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Depending on the battlefield results and the occupation of key cities the Diplomatic Chart will influence the political stance of France, Sweden, Russia and the minor German States. These may add forces to one side or call for withdrawal of friendly forces to observe and deter these states.<br/><br/>Contents:  51 page Gamebook, A4 set of campaign counters, Allied Armies Strength Table, Prussian Armies strength Table, Honour Points Cards, Political Chart, Campaign Calendar, Playing the Cards Chart, Battlefield Creator Chart and a two-page Playsheet (one for the Campaign System one for the Battlefield). There is also 2A3 Campaign map or 4 A4 Campaign maps (depending upon your printer).<br/><br/>Scale<br/><br/><br/>     Ground Scale: 1&rdquo; = 100 metres.

Whether that's a quest for knowledge, a thirst for adventure, a desire for inspiration, or a need to reconnect with your ancestors, the Faraway Valley offers countless opportunities to leave it all behind.<br/><br/>You and your best friends have decided that it's time to change the world &mdash; albeit in your own small way. With that in mind, you arrive in the Valley with plans to craft new villages from scratch. Explore the forests, discover intriguing sites, create pop-up buildings and attract new friends, all of whom will help you create the perfect place to live &mdash; but you'll also have to make sure everyone's needs are met. Can you convince them to stay in your idyllic paradise?<br/><br/>Faraway Valley is a worker placement game in which you must do everything you can to make sure your workers actually stay at the end of the game. Over the course of eight rounds, you need to explore the local forest by placing exploration tiles and by clearing space for strategically placed buildings and housing as you strive to meet the requirements of your villagers.<br/><br/>Victory points are earned through meeting villager requirements, constructing buildings, planting trees, collecting fruit and gaining in-game achievements. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins, having created the best new village in Faraway Valley.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Buddha is a trick-taking game in which players bid the number of tricks they think they can take from each hand, then to take exactly that many; no more and no fewer. Bidding takes place simultaneously, leading to rounds that are sometimes over, or under-bid. Points are awarded only for making the bid exactly and are deducted for missing the bid, either over or under. This is why a good balance of winning and losing the tricks is important.<br/><br/>Buddha uses a 70-card deck that consists of:<br/>four suits Element cards (Air/Fire/Water/Earth) numbered 1-14, <br/>five Yin cards [a Yin card never beats a card], <br/>five Yang cards [a Yang card always any numbered card], <br/>two Yin-yang cards [can be played as either Yin or Yang cards],<br/>one Buddha card [beats all the other cards except the Black Hole card],<br/>one Black Hole card [nobody wins the current trick].<br/><br/>The game lasts six, five, or four rounds depending on the number of players: <br/><br/>    In a six-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 14, then deal each player 11 cards, you should have a 66-card deck to start with,<br/>    In a five-player game, deal each player 14 cards, <br/>    In a four-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 12-13-14, then one of the Yin cards and one of the Yang cards, then deal each player 14 cards, you should have a 56-card deck to start with,<br/>    In a three-player game, remove all the Element cards with value 11-12-13-14 , then keep one of each of the special cards, deal each player 15 cards, you should have a 45-card deck to start with.<br/><br/><br/>Whoever has the most points after six (six-player or three-player game), five (five-player game) or four (four-player game) rounds wins the game.<br/><br/>At the start of each round, all players take a look at their dealt hands, then simultaneously bid on the number of tricks they think they'll take by holding out their fists and on the count of three, revealing a certain number of fingers.<br/><br/>The playing and winning of the tricks uses standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads an Element card, then all other players must follow the same Element, if possible. If a player leads a Yin card, then the second player determines the Element led. If a player leads a Yang card, the Buddha, or the Black Hole card, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases, a player may always play an unnumbered card, even if they hold cards in the same Element led.<br/><br/>After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matches his/her bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, he/she scores 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player misses his/her bid, he/she loses 10 points for each trick that he/she was off, whether it's more or fewer than predicted. If a player makes a bid of zero tricks, he/she scores 20 points if successful, plus he/she wins points equal to the highest bid made times 20, if he/she misses their bid, he/she loses 20 points for each trick he/she takes.<br/><br/>Whoever has the most points after X rounds, wins the game.<br/><br/>-description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tsushima, 1905 2nd ed. uses the Battleship Captain game system to simulate pre-dreadnought naval battles between individually rated warships, especially focusing on early 20th century combat typified during the Russo-Japanese War. Warships from the national navies of Russia, Japan, Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, United States, Austria, Netherlands, Spain, and Sweden are provided in facsimile counters rendered at 1/4200 scale.  <br/>Ship types include battleships, armored cruisers, protected cruisers, coast defense ships (approx. 320 ships), plus 24 generic destroyers and 30 generic torpedo boats, allowing you to play many historical and hypothetical scenarios.  <br/><br/>     Each turn (broken into four phases) equals 10 minutes; <br/>     one movement point equals 3 knots; <br/>     one inch equals 500 yards when measuring range.<br/><br/><br/>If you have Battleship Captain 3d ed. or Tsushima 1st ed., should you consider buying Tsushima, 1905 2nd ed.?  We think the answer is a resounding &quot;yes&quot;.  While continuing to employ the Battleship Captain system, several new optional rules have been provided, including some minor tweaks to game tables, that are more specifically addressed to pre-dreadnought naval combat. To give but one example, fire ratings at Long range are now halved and rounded down instead of rounded up, as in standard Battleship Captain.  Plus, all ship ratings have undergone a thorough review, with many ships having ratings modified up or down just a bit.  This can particularly be seen with ships having Harvey armor. While you can still use Tsushima, 1905 2nd ed. with the ship ratings provided in Battleship Captain Warship Counters, 1890-1945, these new counters and ratings will be welcome for those who appreciate a focus on pre-dreadnought era combat.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Warhammer Age of Sigmar is more than a game &ndash; it&rsquo;s a hobby. Build armies of plastic warriors drawn from the many warring factions that inhabit the Mortal Realms, paint your models to personalise your collection, and take them to the tabletop to play fast-paced games of strategy and action that will allow you to tell your own stories within the Age of Sigmar.<br/><br/>The new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar features the most comprehensive look at the core rules since the first Generals Handbook, and like those changes, the new ones will have an equally huge impact on the tabletop.<br/><br/>Artefacts of the Realms<br/>The Mortal Realms are enormous, and the factions that fight among them are characterised as much by which of the realms they hail from as by their Grand Alliance. Previously, we&rsquo;ve seen this represented largely through creative paint jobs and appropriate basing, with some hobbyists using clever conversions to identify where their force comes from. Now, in the new edition, you&rsquo;ll be able to represent where your army hails from with 84 new magic items. When you&rsquo;re writing your army list, you have the option to pick a Realm for your army to be from. As well as providing you with loads of opportunities for roleplaying (not to mention painting and converting), you&rsquo;ll be able to replace one of your normal Artefact picks with a special artefact from your chosen realm.<br/><br/>Battling in the Realms<br/>The new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar turns the Mortal Realms into rich backdrops for all of your battles. These aren&rsquo;t just optional expansions, but a core part of the game. Each of the Mortal Realms has a set of unique rules that create unusual challenges and opportunities for the armies fighting in them. Firstly, each realm has a command ability, apart from Shyish, which has two, and Ghur, which has wandering, feral monsters instead. Available to every Hero fighting in that realm, these abilities ensure that your army fights in a thematically appropriate way for the realm it&rsquo;s in. Secondly, each Realm has a set of Realmscape Features &ndash; a random in-game effect that&rsquo;ll often have a significant impact on how your game will go. Last, but not least, each of the Mortal Realms has a massive selection of spells associated with it, representing the unique powers that Wizards are able to harness. Each realm has seven spells, ALL of which will be available to ANY Wizard fighting in that realm. Finally, choosing a Realm has a range of impacts on certain warscrolls. Each endless spell, for example, is more powerful when cast in its associated realm.<br/><br/>Command Abilities and Command Points<br/>There are loads of awesome command abilities in Warhammer Age of Sigmar, but in the previous edition, some would almost never see play because they belonged to models who weren&rsquo;t being used as generals. In the new edition, every Hero can contribute and use their command ability, whether they&rsquo;re your general or not. There&rsquo;s a twist, however &ndash; to use any of your command abilities, you&rsquo;ll need a new resource, known as command points. Command points represent the tactical cohesion of your forces &ndash; you&rsquo;ll receive one to add to your pool every turn, and you&rsquo;ll get an additional point at the beginning of the game per warscroll battalion you&rsquo;ve used. That&rsquo;s not all! There are now three command abilities every single army and every single general can use &ndash; a tweaked Inspiring Presence, At the Double and Forward to Victory.<br/><br/>Endless Spells<br/>Magic is changing in the new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar, offering you something never seen on our tables before &ndash; physical sorceries with models and rules of their own. Endless spells are cast like normal spells, but rather than resolving their text with a mere roll of the dice, each summons a model to the table. This miniature then persists throughout the game until it&rsquo;s dispelled. Endless spells are moved at the start of each battle round after determining who gets the first turn, with players taking it in turns to pick a spell to move, starting with the player that has the second turn that round. You&rsquo;ll be able to move any Endless Spell with this move, not just the ones you control, representing their wild and untameable nature.<br/><br/>Look Out, Sir!<br/>With the new command ability system making Heroes more useful than ever, the last thing you want is to watch a critical support character get shot off the table before they get to do anything interesting. In the new edition of Warhammer Age of Sigmar, we&rsquo;ve balanced this with a new ability for Heroes that&rsquo;ll make your smaller and more vulnerable characters a lot more durable at range. By keeping your heroes close to your units, you&rsquo;ll make them much harder for enemies to kill at range.<br/><br/>Magic: Casting and Unbinding<br/>Magic is most interesting when each army&rsquo;s magic phase is distinct and defined by the unique character of the wizards involved. To do that, the new edition sees a change to two classic spells &ndash; Arcane Bolt and Mystic Shield &ndash; to offer more incentive to use the unique spells each Wizard has access to. You&rsquo;ll still find these spells a valuable part of any wizard&rsquo;s toolkit, but they&rsquo;ve been toned down in comparison to others. Secondly, you can now attempt to unbind a spell at a massive 30&Prime; range, up from 18&Prime;, making unbinding much easier and also giving you a chance to deny your enemy key spells even in the first turn of the game, where you may not have had a chance to move your wizards into defensive positions.<br/><br/>Measuring and Piling In<br/>We know most people play Warhammer Age of Sigmar measuring from bases already, so this is just a case of enshrining it in rules and making way for a more tactical era of Warhammer Age of Sigmar. Piling in has changed to work with the new, official base-to-base system, to allow you to get as many models into combat as possible. Where previously, you could only pile in towards the closest enemy model before having to stop, now, you can pile in even if you&rsquo;re right next to someone &ndash; provided you don&rsquo;t move any further away from the nearest enemy model. This should make large units a bit easier to use and should make surrounding enemies a bit simpler. Secondly, you can&rsquo;t choose not to attack with a unit anymore &ndash; the combat phase only ends when every single eligible unit has piled in and participated.<br/><br/>Shooting in Combat<br/>Shooting in the new edition is changing slightly. While you&rsquo;ll still be able to shoot whilst in combat, you won&rsquo;t be able to shoot out of it. This makes for a more dynamic game as far as shooting is involved. Taking a few fast-moving, durable units in your army will be key for quickly occupying shooting units that&rsquo;d usually play havoc with the squishier elements of your forces, while defensively, you&rsquo;ll want to screen your key ranged troops with support troops.<br/><br/>Summoning, For Free!<br/>In the new edition, summoning has been changed to work better for everyone and to properly reflect the unique character of each army that uses it. Rather than summoning units through magical spells, every army that could summon units before now has a unique resource that allows them to bring fresh reinforcements onto the tabletop that fits with their army&rsquo;s background. The big change for matched play, though, is that summoning now no longer costs reinforcement points! Instead, you earn your summoned units with in-game actions: bloodshed, spreading plague, mastering magic, and other thematic goals.<br/><br/>Turn Priority<br/>In Warhammer Age of Sigmar, the game is split into battle rounds, and players roll at the beginning of each round to see who goes first. This means, in effect, a player may occasionally get to take two turns in a row. In the new edition, the studio have added an extra level of depth, choice and chance to this mechanic, as well as removing some of the randomness, to make for more tactical games. Previously, players would roll off to determine who gets to decide who gets the first turn in each battle round, with the winner getting to choose. This works in much the same way in the new edition, but now, if the players get a draw, the player that went first in the previous battle round wins the roll.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Each player starts with a chest card which is placed next to them on the table.

The starting player rolls the dice. From the dice, he/she tells a story using all the dice. The other players then decide on how many gems the story deserves and secretly gives the current player one of his/her gem cards. The current player places the gem cards he/she received from the other players in his/her treasure chest without looking at the cards. Then the next player to the left rolls the dice. Play continues until each player has rolled the dice twice.<br/><br/>All the gems in each player's chest are totaled. The player with the most gems wins the game.

A way to enjoy a naval campaign game without boring administration or complex record keeping!<br/><br/>This book provides a complete set of rules for running a campaign game covering the critical early phases of the naval war in the Atlantic during World War II.<br/><br/>The rules introduce a revolutionary chained event system where the choices and outcomes of earlier events and battles influence the events that may occur, and the options you have later.  No two campaigns play out the same way, providing infinite replayability.<br/><br/>The rules are set up to put you in control of the critical strategic choices that must be made within an ever changing environment of limited information and events that may be outside your control.  But the focus stays centered on the action on the tabletop as you battle it out with your opponent!<br/><br/>Realistic strategic concerns create historical choices for the commanders.   &quot;Should I prolong the fight to finish off these enemy ships, knowing that enemy battleships might be heading this way?  Or should I play it safe, take what I've achieved and get out before they show up?&quot;<br/><br/>Victory conditions ensure that players must make realistic choices about trade-offs between achieving objectives and preserving your forces, just as the historical commanders had to.  Fighting to the last shell is rarely the best option.<br/><br/>Launch raiding sorties, deploy forces to counter your enemy&rsquo;s plans, evade U-Boats, or strangle the enemy&rsquo;s supply lines.  The choices are yours!  Can you anticipate your opponent, or will you be caught scraping together scratch task-forces, to counter an unexpected threat?<br/><br/>The strategic choices are complex, but the record keeping is simple and easy thanks to the chained event system and campaign tracking guide.<br/><br/>Also included are a slew of crunchy new rules including:<br/><br/>     12 new data cards for ships never before seen in Naval Thunder<br/>     Sea State Effects rules<br/>     Rules for incorporating U-Boats into the campaign<br/>     Orders of Battle for the Royal Navy &amp; her allies, as well as the German forces.<br/>     And much more!<br/><br/><br/>Naval Thunder:  The Atlantic campaign is for two or more players, and can be played with or without a referee.<br/><br/>Naval Thunder: Battleship Row and Naval Thunder: Bitter Rivals are required for play.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In February 1904, Russia had the world&rsquo;s third largest fleet, while that of Japan&rsquo;s was ranked fourth. By September 1905, Japan had become number three and Russia had fallen below the top ten.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Rising Sun contains nineteen scenarios for the Admiralty Trilogy&rsquo;s Dawn of the Battleship game, covering all the major surface engagements of the Russo-Japanese War, which led to this stunning reversal of fortunes.<br/><br/>Dawn of the Rising Sun is used with Dawn of the Battleship rules, which are part of the Admiralty Trilogy system, making them easy to follow for experienced gamers and novices alike. <br/>Tactical turns represent three minutes, with intermediate turns (for extended maneuvering) representing 30 minutes. <br/>Gun hit chances are based on a combination of factors such as visibility, range, target size, number of rounds fired at the target, and the speed of the firing and target platforms.<br/><br/>In addition to well-known battles such as Port Arthur, Yellow Sea, and the Tsushima Strait, several smaller battles have been included. The scenario book is full of original after action reports as well as helpful sidebars on a wide range of topics. Each scenario has its own map, showing the disposition of forces. The separate annex booklet includes all the ships that were involved, including information on the guns, torpedoes, and fire control of the era, making it a valuable reference in itself.<br/><br/>Players purchasing the Dawn of the Rising Sun scenario booklet will also need the 28-page Dawn of the Rising Sun annexes booklet, which provides information on all the ships and weapons needed to play the scenarios.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

No knowledge of LARP or Empire is required to play or enjoy the game.<br/><br/>Players represent fabulously wealthy members of the Bloody Butchers Guild of Temeschwar who are seeking to acquire the most prestigious artifacts associated with the Butchers Guild.  Players make sealed bids for Artifact Cards which are revealed in turn, each with a Prestige value ranging from 1-9. Three Banker Cards (featuring Lorenzo La Volpe von Temeschwar, The Master of The Butchers Bank, who was the in-character designer of the game) are shuffled into the deck of Artifact Cards; the game ends when the third Banker Card is revealed.  There is no limit to the amount that players can bid, although whoever has spent the most at the end of the game loses.  The winner is whoever of the remaining players has the most Prestige from the artifacts they have bought.<br/><br/>The unlimited bidding mechanic was inspired by that used in Q.E. and Tony's Treasures.<br/><br/>The game is presented in a hand-crafted wooden box which matches those of other games by The Guild of Good Games in the LARP world of Empire.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Budapest is under siege, its garrison is trapped and fighting a desperate battle. To save them and secure the borders of the Reich, the Axis armies launch three relief operations. Unable to break through, a larger offensive is planned for the spring. Utilising the last of the panzer divisions, Operation Spring Awakening will try to drive the Red Army back over the Danube and secure Germany's remaining oil supply without it, the war will be over.<br/><br/>BACKGROUND A general overview of the war in Hungary in 1945, viewed by the Germans as their priority front line. From the siege of Budapest, through relief Operations Konrad I, II and III, to Operation Spring Awakening and the large Russian counter-offensive that would drive Russian tanks all the way to Vienna.<br/><br/>ARMY LIST Designed to be used with the Russian army lists already published in Battlegroup Fall of the Reich, this book contains two new army lists, for the last German panzer divisions and the Hungarian army, as well as alterations to the Russian Fall of the Reich army lists, to better recreate the battles in Hungary in the winter and spring of 1945.<br/><br/>SPECIAL RULES New special rules to adapt the core Battlegroup game to the Hungarian battlefields of 1945. The special rules recreate the character of the armoured clash, with the last of Germany's panzer forces, SS and Heer, aided by their rather unreliable Hungarian allies, to face the powerful Russian Tank Corps. All take place in the winter snows and spring thaw mudbath, in the largest clash of late-war heavy armour. This book requires Battlegroup Fall of the Reich to use in full, including its Battle Rating counters.<br/><br/>CAMPAIGN Six new historical scenarios in a detailed narrative campaign for 1st SS Panzer Division's hard-fought assault along the rviz canal during Operation Spring Awakening.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Half the Battle is a tactical game of positioning pieces and making difficult choices, with characters inspired by Dungeons and Dragons. All moves and actions are open, and each player has broadly the same opportunities and options, so you win or lose on the strength of your choices not the roll of the dice. The gameplay involves very little luck at all, using dice to track hitpoints and available actions but not for rolling outcomes. With the addition of some randomly chosen items from the bag of holding, there's just enough luck to keep things interesting without overpowering the satisfaction of a well-executed strategy.<br/><br/>Players control a party of adventurers, each of which is unique and useful in different situations. Their three to five abilities are given on a card, and their position on a simple linear track is marked with a token. A die placed on this token marks the character's hitpoints, which also control which of those abilities is available for use. In each round of play, each player selects a character in turn and then gets to use that chosen character, again in turn. This means the first player gets freedom of action, but the second gets more information to work with.<br/><br/>So players must constantly balance offensive and defensive tactics while thinking about positioning and counter-moves. Characters have devastating spells and weapons but can only use their most powerful when on full health, or in a spectacularly fatal and final move. But beware - each party is also allied with a monstrous beast with its own unique skills that ramp up as the battle escalates.<br/><br/>After all, knowing the game is only Half the Battle...<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bloody Kingdom is a set of wargames rules designed for the Civil Wars of Britain, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.<br/><br/>Bloody Kingdom uses the same game mechanics as Father Tilly - although with several important differences.<br/><br/>Players can fight battles at two different scales, either large battles with numerous regiments per side or smaller lower scale engagements where each unit represents a company rather than a regiment.<br/><br/>The basing for these rules are flexible. Players can either use individually based 25/28mm figures or blocks of figures on one base, however, the rules do require the removal of figures so each unit should have at least a few spare figures for casualty removal. When units suffer hits figures are only removed after each suffers four &quot;kills&quot;, this means that great handfuls of figures are not removed with each volley. But ten or twenty percent casualties in a unit does represent significant damage and a significant risk to morale.<br/><br/>The rules contain a detailed method of generating armies which includes the composition, weaponry and tactics of each unit in addition to the leadership qualities, experience and levels of training of each unit. <br/>The rules also include several sample armies that give players &quot;ready to use&quot; pointed-up forces for all of the main factions involved in the Civil War.<br/><br/>As with the Father Tilly rules, the &quot;war-tokens&quot; are also a major feature of Bloody Kingdom and provide an extra layer of period feel and fun, adding such diverse elements as powder explosions, drunken generals, turncoats and court astrologers to the game. <br/>Finally, Bloody Kingdom includes an Edgehill scenario with detailed army lists, a map and unit cards for each of the units involved in the battle.<br/><br/>So if you like a game that emphasises tactics, command, morale and a bit of fun and you like the English Civil War - Bloody Kingdom could be the rules for you, what am I saying - these are the rules for you!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1. The core gameplay of War with Goblins is the fight between different troops and conquering cities. Each player has at his disposal many units, which he can successively introduce to the game if he has only the right number of ducats. About 24 different types of troops take part in the war. On the obverse of the board we have the land map and on the reverse the second, sea map. The game has climatic, oldschool fantasy graphics, perfectly depicting a magical world in which humans coexist with goblins.<br/><br/>2. This is a turn-based war game. The board is divided into areas. Each of them has one type of terrain assigned to it. Terrain affects the movement of units as well as their combat strength. There are 12 cities on the board, a number of villages and dungeons, which are the source of money (ducats).<br/>Each player in his turn can buy troops on the board (in the form of tokens), moves them, occupy areas and fights battles. The strength of the units, their HP, and partly the dice decide about the result of the clashes. Units can be combined into larger groups, up to 4 units.<br/><br/>3. The player who has the most cities after 6, 8 or 10 rounds wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Malbrook s'en va-t-en Guerre are wargames rules designed to re-fight big battles of the War of Spanish Succession with 15mm or smaller scale miniatures. They are derived from my original Close Fire &amp; European Order rules which cover the same time period but were designed for smaller engagements with a larger ground scale.<br/><br/>This big-battle variant of Close Fire &amp; European Order allows players to fight out a full scale battle of<br/>the War of Spanish Succession with a realistic ground scale and without getting bogged down in the minutiae of small brigade actions.<br/>As it is the case with Close Fire &amp; European Order, many of the rule mechanisms have been developed from Andy Callan&rsquo;s American War of Independence rules- Loose Files and American Scramble, which were originally published in Wargames Illustrated no. 1.<br/><br/>In Malbrook, the basic game unit represents a brigade of 3-12 battalions of foot or 6-36 squadrons of horse. These brigades will need to be deployed into commands of several lines, as they were historically, in order to give support if the first line gets into trouble. The simple yet subtle command and control rules encourage players to keep their brigades together in historically realistic formations.<br/>Brigades in range of their leader will usually act as the player wishes, however, if a command becomes broken up then the player will loose control and brigades may start doing things other than what he might wish.<br/>In this period, effective musketry took place at 50-100 yards, In order to re-fight big battles, this distance is reduced to 1-2 inches on the games table. Therefore, musketry is incorporated into close combat.<br/>At the heart of the rule mechanisms is the concept of Disorder Points (DPs). These were invented by Andy Callan for his American War of Independence rules and have proven to be an enduring and elegant way of reflecting the variable state of morale and combat effectiveness. A brigade will incur DPs for manoeuvre, receiving artillery fire, close combat and morale, and they will lose them by halting to redress ranks or through the intervention of a leader. The system is easy to use, does not require any paper work and dispenses with the need for lots of morale checks.<br/><br/>Designed with 15mm in mind, rules can be adapted for other scales.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the rules introduction<br/><br/>",

The set consists in a linen bag containing three kind of small metal tokens, shaped as rice cookers, washing machines, and Japanese trucks. The set can be used as a currency set replacement for any game, or as a game on its own.<br/><br/>The first rule set released for CURRENCY TORRAKU is STACK ATTACK!, a dexterity and bidding game for 1 to 6 players. In STACK ATTACK!, each player begins the game with a set consisting in 2 trucks, 2 washing machines, and 6 rice cookers. Each round, each player bids in turn how many items he can stack, until all have passed. Then, starting with the last player to pass, each player on his turn adds his first item to a stack in the center of the table, until all pieces are gone or the stack falls. If the stack falls, the player who made the stack fall takes the fallen items as penalty. When all players have no pieces left in their betting row for the round, the round ends. If any player has zero items left from his starting set, he wins the game. If no player has zero items left, a new bidding round begins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The original underwater tabletop skirmish game! Deepwars is the only miniatures game where you can have tabletop battles below the waves of a lost underground sea in search of ancient treasures. Players can choose from different distinct forces, from humans in steampunk dive suit to savage merfolk and mysterious high-tech warriors of Atal&aacute;n. Games are played with small sides so players do not need to invest in massive armies, just specialized warbands of personality characters and troops, and can be played in an hour. Take your forces into sunken shipwrecks, shark-infested reefs and lost cities in campaigns of multiple scenarios where each member of a warband can gain advancements as they win battles and gather treasure. But beware of wild creatures that roam the Shadow Sea, as they have their own AI rules that allow them to hunt any model on the board, hungry for blood. The book comes complete with all of the core rules as well as descriptions of all weapons, armor, tech artifacts, magic and special abilities for all characters and has the roster for the four main forces as well as all wild sea creatures. In addition, it includes a section detailing the different environments that players can explore and do battle within and descriptions of all of the different terrain types that can be encountered. Finally, there is a complete toolkit in the back that shows how to build your own custom characters or edit existing ones using a simple point calculation system.<br/><br/><br/>     RULES BASED ON AWARD-WINNING SONG OF BLADES AND HEROES by Ganesha Games but with extensive additional rules, weapons, armor, technology items (akin to magic items) and new combat and movement options. Deepwars include a detailed combat system and multiple combat options with wound tracking for different body part or subsystems. The activation system allows players to choose a basic free action or gamble on rolling dice for more complex actions. Game cards for miniatures are tarot sized (4.75 by 2.75 inch), giving room to include all of the descriptions of Special Abilities, Weapons, Armor and Tech Items. This means much less referencing the rulebook and faster gameplay for all. Sets of game cards can be downloaded in PDF format in the Download section of the website.<br/>     3D GAMEPLAY: In Deepwars, all models are capable of swimming or movement through the water column, which gives the game a distinct three-dimensional feel. Model can pass over and under each other using specific Depth Levels, which are indicated by markers or on a clear acrylic Swim Stand (available in the AMG store). Rules are included for movement across depth levels, where hasty changes in depth can cause deadly barotrauma. There are also rules for the effects of variable visibility and light levels and for models that can easily navigate through the darkness using echolocation.<br/>     INTENSE COMBAT, MAGIC AND TECHNOLOGY in the abyssal depths of the Sea. Breach submarines, uncover undersea temples, battle with schools of sharks and dodge torpedoes while recovering artifacts that hold the secrets of the ethereal void. Spellcasters can wield multiple magical spell types, including elemental magic that causes hydrothermal eruptions and dimensional magic that allows unsavory spellcasters to call forth beings from the ethereal void. Scientists can discover artifacts with tremendous power or design and improve upon their own ether technology to upgrade and create new items.<br/>     SKIRMISH WITH RPG FLAVOR: Combination of 28mm scale miniature tabletop wargame with campaign advancement and a role-playing flavor. The game can be played in single sessions of an hour, or as a campaign where warbands salvage ancient technology, design their own new tech items, enhance abilities and generally become powerful lords of the deep.<br/>     FOUR COMPETING FORCES: Battle with four unique forces below the waves. The human Fortune Hunters are encased in diving suits and utilize salvaged technology to help them control the seas. The Dark Mariners are corrupted beings that summon ethereal beings from the dimensional void. The Ancients of Atal&aacute;n are the remnants of an advanced undersea civilization trying to reclaim their former glory. The Scaly Horde is a loosely organized faction of scaly draconids, fish-men and monstrous creatures that intend to expand their control of the sea, while earning gold selling their services to other forces.<br/>     TOURNAMENT RULES &ndash; The rulebook has an entire section on running tournaments, complete with scoring and timekeeping, as well as new Special Operations that each player gets for a scenario. The Spec-Ops are special missions that a warband can accomplish during a scenario to gain bonus Victory Points.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Uber Soldat<br/><br/>A fast and furious skirmish tabletop game based on Frontline Command&rsquo;s game mechanics, which uses an array of accurate weapon charts.<br/><br/>Take control of an American squad sent against the odds on near suicidal missions to directly oppose the Uber Soldats (Super Soldiers) and genetically tampered SS Guard of Colonel Von Kleist. Can you out-power the twisted creations of Von Kleist and survive the mission given to you and your squad to better understand this frightening new curve of German technological/genetic advancements?<br/><br/>Or command the Uber Soldats and enhanced SS Guard of Colonel Von Kleist on assignments that will turn the war and secure Germany's future. You have no equal. Your units are unlike any others in the world, ones that do not know defeat and vow to bring Germany back from the ashes!<br/><br/>Uber Soldat is set in the late years of World War II; however, the allies have uncovered a secret program the Germans have been developing for years called the UBER SOLDAT or translated &ndash; SUPER SOLDIER! You can play either the German forces which include the SS guard of the elusive Doctor Colonel Von Kliest and his MKI Uber Soldats who are on missions for the German high command or the under-equipped but resourceful and stubborn Americans trying to stop them from extending the war even longer.<br/><br/>Uber Soldat is a fast and furious game and plays in about an hour. There are 3 scenarios included and can be played in succession to see if the Allies are successful in their missions to stop the Germans &ndash; for now. <br/>The box set also includes a copy of Frontline Command Skirmish, which has all the basic rules for game play such as close combat, firing weapons and a whole lot more!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

In fact their size and swiftness made them ideal for this purpose. Such vessels sometimes received criticism from the Admiralty for their sailing durability and inherent weakness, without understanding their exact purpose.<br/><br/>That is not to say that schooners did not actively engage in combat. Their speed made them ideal to intercept Slaver ships for example.<br/><br/>Schooners count as small vessels in Black Seas, operating only a single broadside light cannon.

Players command warbands of different troops and special personality characters to search for treasure, explore sunken ruins and recover ancient artifacts. Blood Reef introduces a new force to the battle, the Nereids of Blood Reef, ancient merfolk with an affinity for all creatures of the sea, and their devious Sea Goblin allies. Each of the main four forces also has new models added to their rosters to help recovers the treasures of the reef.<br/><br/>This book details the region of the Shadow Sea where Blood Reef is located, describing the new environments, wild sea creatures and scenery that can be found there. The reef itself surrounds the sunken city of Xibalba, Gateway to the Underworld. This coral-encrusted city was lost to the sea centuries ago after a massive earthquake. Many of the buildings are now submerged, but tall pyramids, towers and statues still jut from the shallow waters, inviting amphibious warbands to explore them and take control of the glittering artifacts hidden within the crumbling ruins.<br/><br/>The reef has grown with jagged spurs of coral separated by channels of sandy seafloor between them, creating natural corridors of deeper water that allow small craft and submersibles to explore the sunken city. This book has new rules for these small craft and submersibles, including rules for navigation, deployment, surface and underwater combat and boarding operations. Blood Reef is a dangerous place to explore however, and there are wild sea creatures much larger than any of these craft that can tear them into twisted wreckage.<br/><br/>DeepWars is required to use Blood Reef, The core rules are based upon the Song of Blades and Heroes (SOBH) game engine by Ganesha Games and are designed for fast and furious play with plenty of heroic action, arcane magic and advanced technology, all handled with a few rolls of 6-sided dice.<br/><br/>The rules have been designed for battle using 28 mm &ldquo;heroic&rdquo; scale miniatures, with one figure representing one character or creature. Miniatures are referred to as &ldquo;models&rdquo; in the rules, as some larger creatures may not quite be miniature in size. Typical round bases sizes are 30 mm for man-sized or smaller models, 40 mm for bigger models, such as large dive suits, and 50 mm for huge models. Some exceptionally large models, such as undersea vehicles and mechanical contracts, may be mounted on larger oval bases. The nominal ground scale is roughly 15 mm = 1 meter, so most man-sized models are approximately 30 mm tall.<br/><br/>Blood Reef game scenarios typically require more space than DeepWars games, with 60 cm by 90 cm (24 by 36 inches) a good size for skirmishes so that the reef and a section of sunken Xibalba can be laid out. Larger battles and campaigns should be played on maps of 90 cm by 120 cm (36 by 48 inches). Players can use smaller maps if they want, however, if they just want to skirmish on a particular part of the reef.<br/>Battles in Blood Reef take place in many possible environments, under the waves, at the surface and above the water. Gigantic prehistoric reptiles creature prowl the ruins above the waves, so landing parties should be cautious. Even the skies are dangerous for marine models coming to the sea surface, as flying dragons may swoop down to pluck prey from the water. The opportunity to have land and sea battle makes it possible to incorporate models and rules from our land-based game ShadowSea - Conquest of the Underground World into Blood Reef scenarios. The city of Xibalba is also rumored to be a gateway to deep caverns of the stygian realms as well, so players can even choose to incorporate monstrous stygian creatures into their adventures. However you choose to use this rulebook, AntiMatter Games sincerely hopes you enjoy Blood Reef as much as we have enjoyed making it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Regia Marina Fleet<br/><br/>The Italians favoured their fast small boats, typically the MAS boats ( Motoscafo Anti Sommergibile) weighing in at between 20 and 30 tons, smaller than most other nations small craft. They were, however, good boats and gave the Allies a tough time. They had a ten-man crew; their principal armament was two torpedoes and a 20 mm Breda A/A on the rear deck. They were fast, very fast and could make up to 45 knots, outrunning all PT boats and British MTBs. By 1940 48 of the MAS 500 class were available.<br/><br/>Another excellent maid of all work for the Italian fleet was the Gabbiano-class Corvette. At 660 tons they carried a 100 mm main gun forward, three 20 mm A/A and four 20 mm in dual mounts. They were also equipped with two torpedo tubes. These were excellent ships, well-built and pleasing to the eye, not fast (18 knots at best) but with good tactical options for a good commander.<br/><br/>An Italian coastal force is an attractive force to collect. The MAS boat, your main strike force, must use its speed and small size to survive, but although lightly armed and fragile, they are inexpensive boats to add to your fleet. Overwhelm them with numbers and manoeuvring, then hit hard with your torpedoes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "For centuries, Japan's policy of seclusion (sakoku) saw it concentrate on coastal defences in order to repel foreign vessels. However, with the advances other maritime nations were making, it eventually became obvious that no longer would Japan be able to ignore the rest of the world. As an island power, it needed a modern navy. Turning to Britain for assistance, Japan quickly created a powerful modern fleet. It was this capable and confident navy that came out to fight the American Pacific Fleet.<br/><br/>The Japanese understood the potential of air power early and created an effective carrier arm. In addition to the carriers, the Imperial Japanese Navy possessed a powerful battleship force, which included the largest and most powerful battleships in the world, the Yamato and the Musashi. The Imperial Japanese Navy's potential was demonstrated in the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Using armour-piercing bombs and torpedoes, Japanese aircraft inflicted tremendous damage on the American Pacific fleet as it lay at anchor.<br/><br/>Midway was the turning point of naval war in the Pacific and, from then on, the Imperial Japanese Navy was unable to make any headway against the increasing carrier strength of the US Navy. With the victorious Allies pushing towards the Japanese islands, the Imperial Japanese Navy fought desperately to keep them at bay. Kamikaze aircraft and other suicide weapons were deployed, and eventually warships of the Imperial Japanese Navy made death-rides against US forces.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>8 Model Ships<br/>  ‣ 1 Kongō 1941<br/>  ‣ 1 Zuikaku 1944<br/>  ‣ 1 Suzuya 1944<br/>  ‣ 1 Mikuma 1942<br/>  ‣ 1 Yahagi 1943<br/>  ‣ 3 Kagerō-class Destroyers<br/>4 Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero Flights<br/>Ship Cards<br/>Damage Sliders<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Although the United States of America contains a vast area of land, almost all of its allies and trading partners are overseas, and those interests require a powerful navy to support them.<br/><br/>The US Navy possessed some of the largest and most modern battleships in the world at the outbreak of World War Two, and despite losses during the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, was able to maintain a powerful presence in the Pacific. However, in the vast reaches of that ocean the battleship was no longer the king of battle. It was fortunate for the Americans that the handful of aircraft carriers then in service with the US Navy escaped destruction; given later events it is doubtful that a pure battleship force could have defeated the Imperial Japanese Navy.<br/><br/>The aircraft carrier became the main US naval asset during the war in the Pacific, which was very much a conflict between the air assets of opposing fleets. US carrier forces were hard-pressed early on but as the industrial might of the US was brought to bear, new carriers and air groups for them were deployed in such numbers that the enemy simply could not match their strength.<br/><br/>US naval forces were primarily engaged in the Pacific, but some capital ships and larger numbers of destroyers were deployed to the Atlantic theatre where their primary opponents were German U-boats.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/>8 Model Ships<br/>  ‣ 1 USS New Mexico 1941-42<br/>  ‣ 1 USS Essex 1944<br/>  ‣ 1 USS Houston 1940<br/>  ‣ 1 USS Chester 1941<br/>  ‣ 1 USS Portland 1942<br/>  ‣ 3 Clemson-class Destroyers<br/>4 F4U Corsair Flights<br/>Ship Cards<br/>Damage Sliders<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Following the attack on Pearl Harbour, she was redeployed to the Pacific Theatre, along with her sister ships.<br/><br/>For the remainder of the war she supported amphibious operations in the Pacific, shelling Japanese forces during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands and Philippines campaigns. She also supported the invasions of Peleliu, Iwo Jima and Okinawa. Idaho was present in Tokyo Bay when Japan formally surrendered on 2 September 1945.

Players each have a deck of cards numbered 1-9 representing their gourds. 9 is the biggest gourd, and 1 is the smallest.<br/><br/>To duel, two players each put one of their cards face down in front of them in their 'lock box', then announce to the other player which of their opponent's cards they want to destroy. if the named card is in their opponent's hand, it is put in the center of the table face down and removed from play.<br/><br/>Finally, both players secretly compare the cards in their lock boxes. If those two cards are the same value, OR if their values added together equal exactly 10, both of those cards are ALSO put in the center of the table face down and removed from play. Otherwise, the lock box cards go back to their owners hands.<br/><br/>All players continue dueling in this way, switching opponents evenly, until one player has 1 or 0 cards left at the end of a duel. This triggers the end game. Then all players finish out the current round of duels. Finally, all players reveal their highest value card, and the player with the highest value wins game! if there is a tie, the tied players add up the value of all cards in their hand, and whoever has the highest added value wins.<br/><br/>This is a fun, frantic card counting game for 2-6 players and plays in no more than 30 minutes. It was independently produced by Omari Akil, and Matthew Everhart in 2019 with funding from incredible patrons on kickstarter.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

The defense is attempting to match the offense and steal the ball.

        "description": "Two In Common (TIC) playing cards are an intuitive and powerful deck of cards with huge game potential.  Great for families with kids 7 and up, as well as for the most seasoned and serious card players.  May the brain floss begin!<br/><br/>The games are organised by difficulty (or Brain wave:<br/>1) Easy - Brain Ripples <br/>2) Medium 1 - Brain Maps<br/>3) Medium 2 - Brain Waves  <br/>4) Difficult - Gamma Waves<br/><br/>Designed by a Neuroscientist, TIC playing card games challenge your visual perception, processing speed, forward thinking, strategizing and resilience (through frustration and losing!)<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Sample Game #1<br/><br/>Time&rsquo;s a Ticking (2-5 Players, Ages 7+, Average Play Time = 10 Minutes)<br/><br/>To set up, the deck of cards will be shuffled and five cards are dealt face-up onto the middle of the table within reach of all players.  The rest of the cards are distributed evenly among all players.  Any extras are put off to the side, not to be used that game.<br/><br/>There are no player turns in &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s a Ticking&rdquo;.  Instead, the object is to be the first player to get rid of all of the cards in your hand.  Players will be able to play cards to one of the five face-up center cards, covering the existing one like a standard discard pile.  The catch is that in order to lay a card down in must create a &ldquo;Tic&rdquo;.  As explained above, a &ldquo;Tic&rdquo; is when cards have two properties in common.  For example, you could lay a 2-Yellow-Moon on a 4-Yellow-Moon because two of the properties match.  A 3-Blue-Star on top of a 3-Red-Star would also work.<br/><br/>In the event that no one can play any more cards, the player with the fewest cards in their hand is the winner.  You CAN play cards that aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;Tics&rdquo;, but if you&rsquo;re caught, you&rsquo;re out for 5 &ldquo;Tic&rdquo; plays&hellip;meaning you&rsquo;ll need to wait for at least five cards to be played before you can begin laying out cards again.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Sample Game #2<br/><br/>Tic-a-Long (2-8 Players, Ages 7+, Average Play Time = 5-20 Minutes per Round)<br/><br/>Like &ldquo;Time&rsquo;s a Ticking&rdquo;, the object is to get rid of all of the cards in your hand before anyone else.  Each player is dealt eight to ten cards to start, though you can shorten or lengthen the round by dealing fewer/more cards respectively.  If you&rsquo;re playing with younger children for example, you can opt to deal six or seven cards per player.  The deck is put into the middle of the table and one card is drawn face-up as a discard pile.<br/><br/>On your turn you&rsquo;ll try to play cards onto the discard pile, one by one.  If you play a &ldquo;Tic&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll get to go again.  If you play a &ldquo;Single&rdquo;, meaning only one property matches, then your turn is over.  If you can&rsquo;t play anything, then you&rsquo;ll draw one from the deck.  If you still can&rsquo;t play, your turn will end.  If you end your turn by last playing a card with stars, the opponent who goes next must draw cards from the deck equal to the value listed on the stars card.<br/><br/>A player who has one card in their hand must announce it&hellip;if anyone catches them then they&rsquo;ll be forced to draw two cards.  A player&rsquo;s last card cannot be played as a &ldquo;Single&rdquo;&hellip;it must be a &ldquo;Tic&rdquo; or a &ldquo;Tic&rdquo; followed by a &ldquo;Single&rdquo;.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>More games can be found on the official website.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Slam Wars is a card battle game that celebrates the various wrestling territories that existed from the 1940's until the 1990's. It captures the unique flavor of the territory by using historical wrestlers, tag teams, managers, promoters, announcers and referees. Each Slam Wars set is a standalone game, but can be seamlessly integrated with any other Slam Wars set to form a larger playing pool.<br/><br/>Slam Wars: Wrestling Legends of New York comes in a 2-piece full-color dual deck poker box and includes a 20-page full-color instruction guide. There are a total of 90 playing cards:<br/><br/>     44 solo wrestlers<br/>     16 tag teams<br/>     13 stat boosters<br/>     10 common match stipulations <br/>     6 special grudge match stipulations<br/>     1 championship <br/><br/><br/>A round of play is called an &quot;event&quot; and consists of 7 matches (4 solo and 3 tag team). Seven match stipulation cards will be exposed, one for each match of the event. Each wrestler and tag team card is rated in 5 different categories (represented by symbols that match the stipulation cards). The objective is to strategically place the cards you were dealt in matches where they can perform the best (i.e. have high ratings). Like a good wrestling booker, you are trying to maximize your wrestler's strengths and minimize their weaknesses. After comparing the stats in that particular category, the card with the higher rating wins the match-up.  Whichever player wins a majority of the 7 matches wins the event and is awarded the championship card. The holder of the championship card has an advantage heading into the next round of play. Much like poker, the rounds can continue until the participants decide to end it.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Biznelis is a game of entrepreneurship and business management. Biznelis has been designed with the intention of breaking some clich&eacute;s: victory does not depend on luck, there does not need to be only one winner, victory is not for those who have more money.<br/>The game focuses on the growth and solidification phase of the business model that each player creates. Players start with a vague company and have to make decisions that will shape the company and that ultimately involve the development of their entrepreneurial spirit. In this decision-making, subject to restrictions and limitations of resources, the financing, financial sustainability and profitability of the company are involved. The game includes concepts typical of today's society such as the social economy, the collaborative economy, the circular economy and the digital economy.<br/>Once the game is over, the companies of each player will be valued according to the number and suitability of customers who have managed to retain loyalty.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

There are detailed robot miniatures in every set in addition to three types of custom-made dice, two of which are 1-6 and one of which is 1-3. Players use the dice to allocate energy to power the Legacies and activate their attack, which is unique to each Legacy. There are also 3D buildings and mountains in every set: Legacies can destroy the buildings, while mountains can damage Legacies.<br/><br/>To win a round of Core Clash, you need to destroy all of your enemies, achieving victory through attrition. There is no compromise, no middle ground, no surrender: as a Controller, you are in this war to the very end. The fate of Earth rests in your hands, and everyone in your enterprise is depending on you. If you have what it takes to become the Master Controller, untold power and technology are at your disposal. Otherwise, certain destruction awaits.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Hall of the Hag Queen is a supplement to Warhammer Quest, the game of dungeon adventures in the Warhammer World. This adventure pack contains everything needed for your Warriors to battle the Dark Elves of Naggaroth as they search for gold and treasure. Apart from any special rules in this book, all the normal set-up and game rules for Warhammer Quest also apply to Hall of the Hag Queen.<br/><br/>Only a handful of brave adventurers will dare to explore the caverns lining the coasts of the Old World and even fewer would dare to set foot in a Black Ark. From the Sea of Claws to the Black Gulf, incursions from the Dark Elves of Naggaroth are frightening and frequent. And because of this, the area has become known as the &lsquo;Slavery Coast&rsquo;.<br/><br/>In the Hall of the Hag Queen, the Warriors will delve into some of the most volatile areas of the Old World as they search for the hideout of a Dark Elf warband, even boarding their dark, cavernous vessel. They will be thwarted by treacherous passageways and perilous caves in addition to monstrous creatures and devilish traps. Trampling through the caverns of the Hag Queen might be a death sentence at best and an eternity of torture at worst. The Warriors may find themselves prisoners aboard a Black Ark heading back to the Land of Chill to die a slow death as slaves or they may be the victims of ritual sacrifice by the Witch Elves and their blood used to bathe in. But if fate is kind it is possible that they could overcome all obstacles to do something extraordinary; perhaps vanquishing the Hag Queen herself!

        "description": "The P-47 Thunderbolt was a versatile US fighter aircraft produced between 1941 and 1945 operating in both the Mediterranean and Pacific theatres. In addition to eight wing-mounted .50-caliber machine guns, it was capable of carrying five-inch rockets or a bomb load of up to 2500 pounds. When fully-loaded up in this manner, the fighter was one of the heaviest of the entire war. However, this meant it could fulfil a number of roles - performing well as a short to medium range escort fighter as well as in a ground attack role.<br/><br/>The P-47 earned praise form its pilots for its roll-rate and dive speed, and its general performance at high altitude. This performance would suffer at lower altitudes, however, as the climbing and turning rate would become far from optimal. The P-47 was viewed as a very large lumbering aircraft, and German pilots soon learned to climb, rather than dive, when the silhouette of a Thunderbolt loomed from behind. The P-47 was also fairly rugged, capable of sustaining a fair amount of damage, and its cockpit was roomy and offered decent visibility - this was further improved with the introduction of bubble canopies on some variants of the P47-D.<br/><br/>The Thunderbolt ended the war with a total of 3752 air-to-air kills, having been deployed in all USAAF operation theatres (with the exception of Alaska). It also gradually became the primary fighter-bomber of the USAAF, with improvements in fuel allowing it to fly sorties as far as Berlin itself. The supposed tallies claimed by Thunderbolt pilots were astonishing; including 9000 locomotives, 6000 armoured vehicles and 68,000 trucks amongst others. They often employed the low-level skip-bombing tactic, to hit difficult secluded targets, such as rolling stock in tunnels.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Curtiss P-40 Warhawk is an American single-engined, single-seat, all-metal fighter and ground-attack aircraft that first flew in 1938. Used by most Allied powers during World War II, it would see service throughout the war. It was the third most-produced of US aircraft of WW2, behind the P-51 and P-47 - with 13,738 examples produced.<br/><br/>Its first combat was with the British Commonwealth of the Desert Air Force over North Africa and the Middle East. Whilst Warhawk was the name utilised by all USAAF and USAAC units that employed the aircraft, other Allies used the name Tomahawk or Kittyhawk to refer to specific variants. It was thus a Commonwealth Tomahawk of No. 112 Squadron of the RAF that first adopted the iconic &quot;shark mouth&quot; design on an Allied aircraft.<br/><br/>The main theatres of operation for the P-40 were North Africa, the Southwest Pacific and China, though it also served significantly in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, Alaska and Italy. The P-40 was not especially effective at high-altitude combat, where it could be outclassed by both the Messerschmitt BF109 and the Focke-Wulf 190. It excelled at lower altitudes, however, performing as an air superiority fighter, bomber escort and fighter-bomber.<br/><br/>The aircraft's low production cost kept it relevant throughout the war. Though it began to develop a reputation as a mediocre design later in the war, it performed well throughout. If wartime victory claim records are to be believed, the aircraft produced over 200 Allied fighter aces (from 7 different nations), including at least 20 double aces.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Initially a single seater, the Il-2 Sturmovik proved to be a deadly air-to-ground weapon. This variant was to see heavy losses due to its vulnerability to fighter attack. Consequently, by September 1942, a two-seat design with a rear gunner under a stretched canopy entered service.<br/><br/>In the desperate months early in the war, the Sturmovik was pressed into a fighter role. Outclassed by dedicated enemy fighters in dogfights, the Il-2 could successfully take on other Luftwaffe aircraft. The German 7.92 mm machine guns were ineffective against the heavily armoured Sturmoviks, close formations of Junkers Ju 87 Stukas, Junkers Ju 52, Heinkel He 111 and Focke-Wulf Fw 200 Condor bombers would be favoured targets.<br/><br/>Sturmovik pilots employed a brave defensive tactic, they would fly fast and low. This meant that the majority of ground fire would miss or ricochet from the armoured tub. If an enemy fighter closed in, they would slow down, letting the fighter overshoot and fly into the Il-2's firing range.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The result was an aircraft more than able to compete on level terms with the latest Allied fighters, such as the F6F Hellcat, F4U Corsair, and P-51 Mustang.<br/><br/>Supplied in limited quantities, the IJN distributed it to elite units such as the 343rd Kōkūtai Naval Fighter Group (created on the 25 December 1944 and commanded by Minoru Genda).

Here, they are subject to rigorous academic training in all aspects of the law that governs the North American Mega-Cities. By the end of the process, they have acquired a level of knowledge that would exceed those of the most senior lawyers and justice officials of the early 21st century.<br/><br/>In parallel to their academic training, they undergo an intensive physical and mental exercise programme that hones their firearms and close combat skills whilst also preparing them to endure the various injuries and physical hardships that life patrolling the streets will throw at them.<br/><br/>Whilst the life of a cadet is mostly taken up by study and training, if a particularly serious situation or crisis demands the Justice Department deploy more manpower, cadets may be armed and sent out onto the streets, usually as part of a carefully monitored team engaging in fairly low intensity operations. One highlight of a cadet&rsquo;s continual assessment is the &lsquo;Hotdog Run&rsquo; where a group of cadets accompanied by Senior Judges are sent on patrol in the radioactive hell of the Cursed Earth beyond the Mega-City&rsquo;s walls.<br/><br/>However, during the Necropolis and Chaos Day incidents cadets were deployed into highly dangerous situations normally only handled by a fully qualified Judge. Many cadets performed bravely and well, as befitted their training, but the losses incurred had serious future implications for the Justice Department when it was already struggling to maintain enough qualified Street Judges.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Play single-player over and over, pitting your wits against three different levels of difficulty with thousands of unique variations each. Easy and quick to learn, light and fun game.<br/><br/>Map out the Cavern by placing one of your Passage Tokens on any of the 18 hexagonal chambers of the Game Board. There are three different types of passage tokens, each with one entrance and one exit, but in different configurations. You may add, remove, relocate or rotate any of your Tokens at any time during placement; however, you can only win by forming a complete loop through the complex without any dead ends.<br/><br/>You score one point for each chamber your loop passes through with a maximum score of 18 if you have managed to use all your Tokens and fill the complex. Good luck, and happy spelkunking!<br/><br/>Mostly a single Player game, but can be played head to head against other players with additional purchase of full games or multi-player Expansion Packs. These are enveloped and only contain additional player boards and Passage Tokens and cost less.<br/><br/>This is a hand crafted, made to order game made with high quality, durable plastic components.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is a competitive card game for 2-4 players that uses a standard deck of cards, a single six sided die, red, white, and blue poker chips, and player provided tokens or pawns to recreate the world of H.P. Lovecraft, with four eldritch towns (Arkham, Dunwich, Innsmouth, and Kingsport) surrounding Miskatonic University.<br/><br/>Players take on the role of investigators, going from town to town to find clues and artifacts to aid them in their struggle.  Along the way, they encounter cultists, priestesses, and wizards that pay tribute to the Elder Ones. Each encounter has the potential to cause investigators to lose health and sanity or gain power to fight the ultimate monster.  The object of the game is to be the first investigator to defeat a horrible monster called a Shoggoth and win.<br/><br/>The game sets up in about 2 minutes, plays in about 20, and is put away in about 2 minutes.  The rules are free, under creative commons, and all you need is a standard deck of cards, a d6, and 3 different colored poker chips.  You will also need to provide your own player tokens or pawns.

        "description": "\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tIntroductionSwack is a finite territory game for two players: Black and White. It is played on the spaces (squares) of a square board of any size.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, all squares of the board are covered with black and white pieces in a checkered pattern. On odd-sized boards, the center square is occupied by White. Additionally, each player must have access to a sufficient number of off-board pieces of their own color.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tDefinitionsIn these rules, &quot;adjacent&quot; always means &quot;orthogonally adjacent&quot;.<br/><br/>A stack is a piece lying directly on the board along with all other pieces piled onto it on the same square. The color of a stack is the color of its topmost piece, which denotes its owner. The height of a stack is the number of pieces in it.<br/><br/>A group is a stack along with all other like-colored stacks one could reach from it through a series of steps between adjacent stacks of its color. The size of a group is the number of stacks in it.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPlayBlack plays first, then turns alternate. On your turn, perform exactly one of the following actions:<br/><br/><br/>     Pass.<br/><br/><br/><br/>     Move the topmost piece of a stack of your color onto an adjacent enemy stack, provided that, before the move, the heights of both stacks are the same. Then, place a piece of your opponent's color onto the stack from which you just moved your piece.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when both players pass in succession. Then, the players jointly remove pairs of opposite-colored groups of the same size from the board until there are no more such pairs to remove. The player with the biggest group left over wins. On even-sized boards, if the board is empty, whoever made the last move before the game's end loses.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tPie ruleThe pie rule is used in order to make the game fair. This means White will have the option, on their first turn only, to swap sides with their opponent instead of making a regular move.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tVariantsFree Swack: The board is initially empty. On your turn, instead of making a swap, you may place a friendly stack of height two on an empty square and an enemy stack of height one on an empty square orthogonally adjacent to it. At the end of the game, if the scores are tied all the way down to the smallest group, whoever made the last move wins.<br/><br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t<br/>\t\t\t\t\tNotesSwack is based on the same designer's Escabel and Michał Zapała's Slyde.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players are competing to manage and grow their entire mining outfit while acquiring the most gold before the ground is too frozen to dig. The Alaskan countryside is an inhospitable environment, so players will face hardships that affect their entire outfit &ndash; not to mention the ever-dropping temperature that will shut down their operation.<br/><br/>In Pay Dirt players start with a small basic crew, an unimpressive claim, mediocre equipment and just a little bit of cash to make a go in one of the toughest competitions this side of the globe. Gold mining isn&rsquo;t cheap and players will have to sell their gold throughout the game to keep the equipment running and their workers happy. Through clever use of their equipment and workers, players can make their mining outfits more efficient and dialed in to their preference of play. Will you recruit heavily and stack your camp with workers or will you keep your eyes on better and more efficient equipment? Will you have what it takes to hit to strike it rich and hit pay dirt?<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Volume 7 of Refighting History, Charles S. Grant examines the Seven Years War battles in the Western Theatre.<br/><br/>From 1757 through to 1762 an Allied Coalition army fought against the French in support of Prussia. In August 1758, the first British contingent of troops arrived. The Allied army was a polyglot mix from nations including Britain, Brunswick, Hanover, Hesse, Prussia and Schaumburg-Lippe-B&uuml;ckeburg.<br/><br/>This volume follows Charles&rsquo; normal formula of setting the scene, describing the historical battle, discussing how best to wargame it and then an account of how the game played out.<br/><br/>The book has three major actions from the years 1760, 1761 and 1762. <br/>These are:<br/><br/>     Warburg,<br/>     Vellinghausen and<br/>     Wilhelmsthal. <br/><br/><br/>The first game covers the whole battle, the second just one, but critical, part and the last is divided into two games.<br/><br/>There are additional chapters on The British Contingent in the Western Theatre and The Legion Britannique.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Panzerkrieg, Designer Signature Edition marks the return of a true wargaming classic by John Prados, faithfully remastered and updated with this all-new, supersized edition. John Prados introduces some discrete but friendly changes to the system to improve his classic design covering operational warfare in Southern Russia during WWII.<br/><br/>Panzerkrieg is an operational level simulation of the various Axis and Soviet campaigns in southern Russia during the period 1941-1944. <br/>The game is played on a map depicting southern Russia from its western border with Rumania and Poland in the west to the Caucasus mountains in the east. <br/>These operations, more than any others, display the large forces and vast distances that characterized the protracted warfare between the industrial giants Germany and the Soviet Union. The simulation presents ten scenarios (including one learning scenario), each modeling a different period of the war. Each scenario is played as a separate game and all scenarios use the same rules and components.<br/><br/>The game is an examination of the battles which shaped the campaign and is based upon evaluation of the combat forces, the leaders, the logistical limitations, and the terrain over which the antagonists struggled. <br/>Panzerkrieg has been designed primarily as a two-player game, with one player commanding the Axis forces and the other the Soviets. It is well-suited for solitaire play, however. When played solitaire the competitive value of the game will be missed, but its value as an historical tool will be undiminished.<br/><br/>Some of the game rules include armor superiority, breakthrough and exploitation, leaders, supply, fortifications, bridgeheads, special units, combat reserves, rail and naval movement, air power, and Axis satellites. The game consists of ten separate scenarios, each depicting an important operation, along with the learning scenario.<br/><br/>Rather than being a simple retread with nicer components, this new edition incorporates additional markers and introduces limited intelligence and fog of war, suitable for two players, along with other changes and enhancements to the system that are fully detailed in the Designer's Notes. Enhancements have been made pertaining to the combat system, air bombardment, effects of leaders, changes to &quot;stalemate&quot; combat result, changes to anti-tank units to more properly reflect the tactical doctrine, altered Battlegroup/Replacement rules, changes to Exploitation Segment, and more. As fully noted by the designer, these are all key enhancements to improve the historicity and play experience of this classic design.<br/><br/>Product Information:<br/><br/>     Complexity: 5 out of 10<br/>     Solitaire Suitability: 7 out of 10<br/>     Time Scale: one week per turn<br/>     Map Scale: 14 miles per hex<br/>     Unit Scale: divisions and corps<br/>     Players: one to two, best with two<br/>     Playing Time: 2-5 hours<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher's website<br/><br/>",

But there's a choice to be made: the Evil Robots suggest simply eliminating all humans right now, while the Good Robots champion a symbiotic coexistence.<br/> You are an Undecided Robot, partaking in crucial mock trials to help the collective choose a path forward. By simulating the decisions of famous robots from the past, you strive to amass Influence &ndash; the key to leadership and the decisive voice over the Robots&rsquo; path forward. Will you usher in an epoch of unity and shared prosperity for the Good of all, or establish a dominion of Evil Robots?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Evil Robots is a hidden-roles social game for 3-9 humans pretending to be robots debating the future of humanity. To win you&rsquo;ll need to negotiate, bluff, and use your robotic abilities to get yourself on the winning team for a share of the Influence Tokens in each round.<br/><br/>Your challenge is to work out when and how to take your turn in each round, to get yourself onto that winning team. Too early and you might lock yourself into a position you regret. Too late and you might have all the knowledge but no opportunity to use it.<br/><br/>In each round you&rsquo;ll have two robot cards, two coins, and two actions. You&rsquo;ll flip those coins at the start of the round and if they match, you&rsquo;re on that team &ndash; Good or Evil. If not, you&rsquo;re Neutral &ndash; and Neutral can&rsquo;t win.<br/><br/>At some point in the round, you&rsquo;ll get a Power Card and then take your turn. You&rsquo;ll spend your actions to change your team, or someone else&rsquo;s team, or use your robot cards for their abilities.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, the winning team is the one with the highest total Power. We keep playing new rounds until someone reaches 10 Influence Tokens and wins the game!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "You will find inside this book background, technical data and color schemes for 30 vehicles used by the Imperium's elite fighting forces. Several of these have been included more than once because the different armies have different options for the same vehicle, and the book needs to show this. We couldn't very well include Space Marine Rhinos, and not the Inquisition version, although the rules are similar they are not exactly the same and neither are the colour schemes. As a definitive guide the book needs to be thorough. Other vehicles, such as the Chimera and Valkyrie, were included in IA: Volume 1, but again these vehicles are available to Inquisition forces, and the book would be incomplete without them..... ...Using this book is as much about using the background material and illustrations as it is the game rules.Hopefully the background should provide ideas for games including the model, and the pictures should help fire the imagination. Try using the formation diagrams as a guide to battlefield tactics, or making a certain type of vehicle central to a scenario.<br/><br/>",

Manage your time and resources effectively, and gain as much experience behind the Potter's Wheel as you can before the master potter must pick their disciple.<br/><br/>The Potter's Apprentice is a complex strategic Euro game centered around multi-use cards and a rondel-like board.<br/><br/>The game plays for 3 rounds, each one a bit shorter than the previous. Each round players will take turns moving their apprentice around the Studio Board to visit various Locations for acquiring new Assignments, Clay,  and other resources - as well as the Potter&rsquo;s Wheel to throw (a ceramics term for shaping a clay vessel on a rotating wheel) their pottery and the Kiln to fire (the process of exposing ceramic pieces to high heat in order to convert them into durable finished pieces) their already-thrown pieces. Each turn the player may also be able to benefit from the bonus of a discarded Apprentice Card, and/or Special Abilities that are unlocked as players earn Experience throughout the game.<br/><br/>As players move around the studio, they will drop Potter&rsquo;s Clay (of their unique player color) at various Batts (a term that refers to the circular plate on a Potter&rsquo;s Wheel, short for Batterboard) where each round an assortment of Scoring Tiles are placed. Scoring Tiles provide players individual goals for earning additional Victory Points at the end of the game. At the end of each round, which is triggered after all players have passed due to running out of Potter&rsquo;s Clay, players determine the winner of each Scoring Tile based on the player who left the most Potter&rsquo;s Clay next to it. The end of the first 2 rounds also awards some Victory Points for Vessels placed in the Kiln. At the end of the third round players proceed to the Final Scoring phase where they tally up all their Victory Points from personal Scoring Tiles they earned, Vessels they fired, the size of their Supply collection, their least-developed Experience Track, and Public Scoring Tiles. The player with the most Victory Points is declared the winning apprentice.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cutters were usually tiny or small vessels with a single mast. Designed for speed more than transport capacity, the mast has a triangular aft (behind the mast) sail rigged fore and aft (from the front to the rear) and a headsail (a triangular sail rigged in front of the mast).<br/><br/>Though unable to compare in power to the heavily armed ships of the line, these vessels nevertheless played an important role in the Napoleonic Wars, ferrying supplies &amp; troops, as well as carrying information around the fleet. Their swiftness made them especially suited for this latter purpose.<br/><br/>In Black Seas, Cutters are considered unrated ships with 2 broadside light cannons. They share the highest Rate of Knots value in the game and thus provide an extra dimension to gameplay as they zip about the ocean battlefield.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

These brave humans, unyielding robots and mysterious aliens are exploring the uncharted space of the Distant Edge in search of the ultimate prize - Hexis crystals - a power source that will change the image of space travel forever. In hostile places on primeval planets, where a lasergun in your holster is the only law, will you be the one who prevails and claims all the glory?<br/><br/>To play a game of Battedrill, you will need miniatures with their stat cards, dice, measure widgets (or a measure tape) and a table that will represent the battlefield of the skirmish between two opposing crews controlled by the players. Controlling your crew means performing available actions with your miniatures, such as moving, attacking or taking special actions. We have kept the rules simple and straightforward to provide dynamic battles, but also not to reduce the challenge and the tactical aspect of the game. Every model has a set of unique statistics and abilities, whose wise use is the key to victory.<br/><br/>",

At the start of the game, each pit contains one seed.<br/><br/>During their turn, a player rolls a die. He then chooses one of his nonempty pits to sow. They take one seed from the sown pit, and move it counterclockwise according to the die value rolled. Then, they must roll to move each remaining seed from the sown pit. The turn only ends once the sown pit is empty. So, for example, if a player chooses to sow a pit with 4 seeds after his initial roll, 3 additional rolls will be needed.<br/><br/>A player wins when all ten seeds are on their part of the board at the end of their turn.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

A beautiful area of rainforest has been cut down to make way for yet another palm oil plantation. The very center of the deforested area has been spared as it is host to trees producing smelly durian fruit. The exploiters of the future plantation simply could not stand the smell and left this small group of trees alone. Contrary to the loggers, Borneo orangutans love durian fruit, but their access to the trees has now been cut off. Orangutans nearly solely travel through tree tops, swinging elegantly at impressive speeds. They hardly ever travel over the ground, so how do they now get to their favorite meal in the rainforest? You can help them, by growing back the rainforest.<br/><br/>Role the dice to determine your action for each turn. Actions include placing a new rainforest tile, introducing an orangutan chit, moving a rainforest tile, or moving an orangutan chit (1 or 2 moves).<br/><br/>Players aim to create a path for their orangutans to swing to the durian trees in the center of the board. They have to avoid blood pythons and can make use of other orangutan tiles or chits (including those of opponent players), which will help them move faster towards the durian trees. The first player to feed all of his/her orangutans, by occupying the durian trees, wins!<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "At the beginning of each level, players use hex tiles and a 6-sided die to randomly generate that levels dungeon map and starting boss position. On each turn, players will move (if they wish) and then choose an action: trade items, revive another hero, rest up, or search the area. When searching the area, the hero could find treasure, the level key, a foe to battle, or even a trap.<br/><br/>While battling foes and each level boss is encouraged in order to obtain higher levels through experience gains, once the key is located, the players can proceed through the door to the next level. A new board is generated, a new boss is drawn, and things get a little bit more difficult.<br/><br/>By the time players reach level five, the foes and level boss are extremely strong (this difficulty increase is directly related to the number of players in the game). The game ends when the boss on level 5 is defeated or when the boss on level 5 has knocked all heroes unconscious. Heroes Vs. Foes is a fully-cooperative game, so all players will win or lose together.<br/><br/>The standard edition offers 10 heroes to choose from (each with their own unique abilities, stats, and boons), 8 bosses, 27 foes, 57 items, 9 familiars, and 9 traps, making the possibilities of game play figuratively limitless. The game provides a mix of tabletop role-playing game and old-school dungeon crawler board game mechanics to generate a full campaign with long-term decisions while allowing all players to take part in the action. It has a moderate learning curve made easier with the more background in TTRPG and traditional dungeon-crawler stats and mechanics. Once moving, the game easily plays itself and provides difficulty and teamwork for even the most avid players.<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

The players must work together to escape from a fierce band of angry apes to win the game.<br/><br/>The board depicts a bird's-eye view of the pyramid, rising out of a jungle. The adventurers' rescue helicopter will land on the top of the pyramid (center of the board). If everyone can reach the top of the jungle pyramid before the apes get there, they will be rescued.<br/><br/>Each player has three randomly-dealt cards which provide certain abilities or hindrances, and a little treasure as well. On each turn, a player rolls a die which moves all the apes. (There are simple rules guiding the Apes' movement, which increase the tension as the game goes on.) Then they roll a die for their own movement, with which they can move in any direction, around or up and down the pyramid levels. If a moving adventurer is in a space adjacent to another adventurer, they can help that companion to move up (or down) the levels. Also, leaving treasure on the path distracts the advancing Apes (but only temporarily).<br/><br/>Can your intrepid explorers get to the apex of the pyramid to be rescued? (Bonus points if they get rescued with some treasure left!)<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each player takes on a role of a graffiti artist, and you need to pick paints, and combine and use them to create great panels with your signature. Are you ready to control the walls of the street?<br/><br/>To set up, place eight paint cubes in each of the four rondels of the main game board; each rondel looks like an old-school LP record divided into eight colored sections. Use only primary paint cubes (blue, red, yellow and white) for now, then place the wall board next to the main board. Take an individual player board to organize your components, then shuffle the mural cards and reveal four face up.<br/><br/>On a turn, collect paint cubes or use a mural card to occupy a place on the wall board. By scratching the LPs &mdash; that is, turning the rondels &mdash; you can collect paint. You can rotate a rondel one space for free or spend workers to move more spaces or a second rondel; by matching colors across LPs, you can collect paint. By discarding a worker, you can use Basquiat's Lessons to duplicate paint cubes in your bag, change their colors, or obtain secondary colors.<br/><br/>Once you have the necessary components, you can complete a mural card by discarding the paint cubes required, possibly creating secondary colors along the way by discarding primary cubes. You receive points for these cards at the end of the game, and these cards depict different elements of hip hop, with you scoring bonuses from bonds of matching elements on the wall board.<br/><br/>When the wall board is finished, the game ends, and whoever has the most points becomes King of the Wall!<br/><br/>",

After that, it&rsquo;s an all-out bidding war to see who can tip-toe the furthest around the volcano &mdash; without getting burned.<br/><br/>Instructions.<br/><br/>Gameplay takes place over a series of rounds. At the start of each round, players must set their lava traps.<br/><br/><br/>Out of sight of the other players, take your cluster of Blinks in setup mode and single click any number of them to activate (or de-activate) a lava trap. Lava traps look like 2 red faces rotating around the Blink, while non-trap pieces are 2 green faces rotating. Make sure to remember where you place your traps!<br/><br/>Once satisfied with your trap placement, double click any Blink in your cluster to hide your lava traps under a beautiful green grassy hill.<br/><br/>With the traps hidden, all the players connect their Blinks back together into one mega cluster. The oldest player starts by betting how many Blinks they can click without hitting any Lava Traps (e.g. &ldquo;I think I can click two Blinks without hitting any lava&rdquo;).<br/><br/>The player on their left must now either raise or challenge. If they raise, they must bet a higher number (e.g. 3 Blinks or more). But if they challenge, the previous player must carry out their bet to see if they can do it. They must start by single clicking one of their own Blinks. After that, they can click any Blinks they like.<br/><br/>If the player that has been challenged fails to click all the Blinks wagered without touching lava, the Volcano will erupt, spraying ash everywhere and covering the hill with lava. A new round now begins, but the player who lost the challenge will have one Blink removed from their cluster (e.g. if last round they had 4 Blinks, this round they will have 3). However, if the player successfully completed the challenge and didn&rsquo;t set off the Volcano, in the next round the player that challenged them will lose a Blink.<br/><br/>",

To switch between weapons, single click your weapon Blink. <br/>There are four types of apparitions that may appear depending on the level you selected, and each one can only be killed by a specific weapon on your gadget. The apparations and their weaknesses are:<br/><br/>GHOSTS<br/>Ghosts appear WHITE and are killed by the Flashlight (WHITE)<br/><br/>GHOULS<br/>Ghouls; appear RED and are killed by the Laser (RED)<br/><br/>POLTERGEISTS<br/>Poltergeists; appear BLUE and are killed by the GeistLight (BLUE)<br/><br/>GOBLINS<br/>Goblins; appear GREEN and are killed by being hit with the Flashlight and the Laser at the same time (WHITE and RED)<br/> Each apparition takes a small amount of time to materialize into the mortal plane. Make sure to zap the ghosts before they fully materialize, or the mansion will be lost. <br/> WIN CONDITION<br/>If an apparition fully materializes in this plane before you zap it, the mansion will become irreparably infested with demons and you will have lost. However, if you are able to ward off spirits for a whole minute then the house will be cleansed and glow with a holy yellow light. <br/>You may then double-click any Blink to return to level select, and pick a new level to battle the ghosts again.<br/><br/>",

Take control of either the highly trained human forces, United Nations of Earth Commandos or the fearless machine forces comprised of G12 Nightmare robots and the dreaded Mark VII Assault Fiend. Various scenarios are included in the boxed set which you win by completing the mission objectives.<br/><br/>Legions of Steel is played over a series of rounds each comprised of an Initiative Segment, 2 player turns and an end segment. At the beginning of each Round the players roll a d6, higher roller winning initiative. The player with the initiative decides who will have the first turn this round, themselves or their opponent. The person whose turn it is, is considered the active player.<br/><br/>The active player activates each of their figures moving and attacking. Once a figure has been activated and its actions are finished, a marker is place next to that figure to indicate its state. If the figure attacked, a fired counter is placed next to it. If it did not fire, it is considered Covering which means that it is holding its attack for future use, including during the opponent's turn. Attacking at an opponent is accomplished through rolling a 6 sided die (sometimes more depending on the weapon and your tactical decision). There are various options for attacks including auto-firing, spreading your attack to multiple targets, hand to hand engagement and more that add to the tactical decision process. In addition, some figures have special abilities like Leadership or Extra Lives. With leadership a Sergeant figure can influence die results, allow troopers to move farther or command them to attack out of turn. The Mark VII Assault fiend has an extra life as it takes 2 hits to eliminate it from the game.<br/><br/>The tactical decisions in this game are many with plenty of player interaction. You will be jockeying your forces for tactical advantage, trying to get the upper hand from round to round.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The game is based on the assumption that all players have basic knowledge of Agile and Scrum, and a facilitator, like an experienced Agile Coach (or similar), is available.<br/><br/>In fact, DSbuilders is a team-based, co-operative, serious game on scaling agile teams across organization. The game is played by six teams, each of them with 1 to 8 players, and they have to build all systems of the Dark Star, the new weapon designed to conquer the galaxy.<br/><br/>The game takes place over six turns, and each turn the teams have to define their work (components to build) considering all constraints (capacity, integrations and dependencies). At the end of each turn, the Emperor (facilitator) defines the short term goal on the basis of the events happening in the galaxy.<br/><br/>If you fail to achieve any intermediate goal, game over!<br/>If you fail to achieve the final goal, game over!<br/>If you achieve the final goal, you conquer the galaxy!<br/><br/>",

Players will search out merchant ships or royal held islands and plunder them for supplies, treasure and money. With the supplies, the players can deliver them to nearby markets for selling to further increase their money. However, a captain's fortune is not safe until they can successfully bury it on the hidden island. Do not hold onto too much loot or another player may decide you are an easier way to grow their fortune.<br/><br/>Each player will have crew tokens to assign positions on their ship board in secret. When all players have made their assignments, everyone reveals their choices and whoever has the most speed will move first. Crew assignments may depend on many factors including wind direction, nearby targets to attack, other players and the navy ships out on patrol.<br/><br/>Each round the merchants and navy move around on trade routes, while the King's islands produce more supplies to be sold at market. Each market has its own demands for the four different types of supplies and it changes as player's sell their ill-gotten goods. In addition, every round has shifting winds making every decision in every round impactful.<br/><br/>Will you go for the island that has a bunch of one resource in hopes the market demand is high? Or will you risk confrontation with the navy to steal from the merchant ships? Perhaps that other pirate ship is too encumbered by its own fortunes and is ripe for the taking.

This kit allows each player to start with a blank tile that can be played on any open square during their turn at any time during the game.<br/><br/>The ACQUIRE Wild Tile Kit includes six (6) blank tiles and an instruction booklet. Tiles are from actual ACQUIRE games that have been painted to hide the designations. The instruction booklet is printed on yellow card stock for maximum durability and readability.<br/><br/>The Wild Tile Variant allows each player to start the game with that one &quot;key&quot; tile that they may need at one point in the game. It increases the ability to create mergers and helps to alleviate frustration when a player has nothing but &quot;bad&quot; tiles and is unable to maintain a foothold in the game. Some games, with the luck of the draw, a player may never need their Wild Tile.<br/><br/>Included with this Wild Tile Kit are Lloyd's Rules of ACQUIRE, which were designed to help eliminate the one-sided games that can occur during the regular game play in ACQUIRE.<br/><br/>(The Wild Tile Variant is an idea conceived by Allan Wright)<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Reuniting a complete family on the board, on different turns, you obtain the sum of the points of the cards + points indicated on the bonus card.<br/>3. Reuniting a complete family in one turn, you obtain double points (from played cards + bonus)<br/><br/>At the start of the game each player has 5 cards, on each turn there are two phases:<br/>1. Draw a card from the deck or discard pile and play a family (complete or incomplete).<br/>2a. Say it's the end of the turn turn.<br/>2b. Or the player can discard a card from the hand, then asking to opponent if he has a card that can be used to complete a family: if he does, he must give it to the player; if he doesn't, the player loses the discarded card.<br/><br/>At the start of the next turn, each player starts draw to complete a hand of 5 cards and start again until the deck is depleted.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Demockrasy is a two to eight player game in which you play the role of a powerbroker behind the scenes of American politics, putting together Politicians with Supporters whose votes they wield. Players compete to gain Power over the course of the game by voting on legislation their supporters approve or oppose; at the end of the game, the player with the most Power is the winner.<br/><br/>Demockrasy is played over four rounds. Each round has a Drafting phase, when you choose Politicians and Supporters, and a Legislation phase, when you sponsor and vote on Legislation.<br/><br/>During the Drafting phase, players pass several hands of cards around the table, each hand containing Politicians and Supporters. Players pick one of the cards from their hand, play it face-up in front of them, and pass the hand to the next player (passing left or right, depending on which round it is). There are three types of cards: Politicians, which may carry one to five supporters; Supporters, which give their associated politician one, two, or three votes; and Wild cards, which give the player a one-time opportunity to affect a legislative outcome or attack an opposing politician.  Once all players have played five cards, the Legislation phase begins.<br/><br/>During the Legislation phase, each player must sponsor one Bill from their hand of Legislation cards (each player receives four Legislation cards at the beginning of the game).  The player with the top-ranked politician sponsors the first Bill. Once the Bill has been revealed, all players must cast a vote to OPPOSE or APPROVE the bill on behalf of all of their supporters and politicians.  Each player votes the total number of votes provided by their supporters. A simple majority wins; in a tie, the Bill fails.<br/><br/>Supporters may (a) APPROVE a Bill, (b) OPPOSE a Bill, or (c) neither. If a Politician betrays a Supporter--for example, by voting to APPROVE a Bill that's opposed by his or her supporters--then that Supporter will abandon its Politician and break one of that Politician's hearts.  Each politician has 1 to 5 hearts; when the last heart breaks, the Politician retires and the associated supporters are discarded. Players also receive a broken heart--which they can assign to a politician of their choice--when they are on the losing side of a vote.<br/><br/>There are three ways to gain power: (1) if you sponsor a bill that passes, you get 1 Power; (2) if you APPROVE a bill that passes, you get 1 Power; (3) you get 1 Power for each Legislation result that aligns to your Supporters' interests.<br/><br/>After each round, clean up the spent Legislation cards and deal new Demockrasy cards (Politicians, Supporters, and Wild cards) to build up your political staff again! After four rounds, count up the power gained by each player; the most powerful player is the winner!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The game also includes a number of &quot;taste&quot; cards which include a spectrum, such as Unknown/Familiar.  In the game's two modes, these cards will be used to describe flavors.<br/><br/>Notably, the game suggests that the players' provide prosciutto (recommended), otherwise sliced cheese, in order to contain the spices.<br/><br/>In one game, a government spy has snuck into the Cyber Gastronomy Club.  The non-spy players will taste a certain combination of spices, and all of the players will describe what they are tasting, including the spy, by drafting taste cards from a face up pool and creating a menu name for the prosciutto/cheese they tasted.  The players then discuss who the spy is, and an accusation process follows.<br/><br/>In the other game, the Cyber Gastronomy Club has developed a new way to communicate through spices. One player creates a spice mix and the players attempt, through taste, to determine the spices.

The rules are different, and there is more emphasis on speed.<br/><br/>The general framework is like in Borel. The cards describe probability experiments with yes/no answers, for example: &quot;You roll the d10 four times. Will the maximum roll exceed 8?&quot;<br/><br/>You draw a card, and read aloud the question, the players vote yes or no, and you then conduct the experiment. Being good at probability will give you an advantage, but you can also win if the dice roll your way.<br/><br/>In the original game, you bet various amounts of money using chips, and you reveal your bets simultaneously. In this game, the first person to put forward their yes/no card, becomes the &quot;Leader&quot; and gets their preferred outcome, while all the others must bet on the opposite outcome. You get 3 points if you bet correctly. The experiment is then performed a second time, where the players are allowed to bet freely, except for the Leader, and you score 2 points if you bet correctly. First player to 25 points win.<br/><br/>By being the first to commit to a bet and becoming the Leader, you can force all the others to bet the opposite. However, the Leader is not allowed to change their bet in the second round, so betting too quickly can be dangerous, too.<br/><br/>",

This is the most important party of your life!<br/><br/>In Triumphus, you will need to use your best supplies, including wine, decorations, food, entertainment, and offerings, to gain The Emperor's rewards, which you can sell to obtain even more supplies, or hoard to gain his respect.<br/><br/>On your turn, you will attempt to match the supplies from the cards in your hand with the requirements on a single reward card in the community market of five cards. If you can match all of the icons on a reward, discard the supplies and take the reward, which will be valued between 4-7 points; however, the only way to get more of the necessary supplies is to sell a reward by flipping it face down and drawing as many supply cards as the card's point value. This will reduce the points for the card from face-value to only 1, so make sure you only sell rewards when you need to. And make sure you don't have more than 10 supplies at the end of your turn or you'll need to discard!<br/><br/>Keep up this simple loop, deciding at every turn whether you'll need an extra supply or an extra point to win. The game continues until the last reward has been collected. Count your points to see who gets the job and the favor of the high court! Every reward card you haven't sold is face-value, plus 1 additional point for each one you have sold.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The first expansion for Commands &amp; Colors: Medieval.<br/><br/>The original plan was to have the Medieval expansions follow a somewhat historical timeline, but to keep in tune with player requests and feedback, GMT chose to jump ahead in time some 500 plus years to the Crusades. Actually reflecting on the decision, this jump makes a lot of sense, since there are marked similarities with many Byzantine battles as featured in the Medieval game and the battles fought during the Crusades gameplay wise, rule wise and transitional-thinking wise.<br/><br/>Yes, there are plenty of knights in shining armor in this expansion, but there are no damsels in distress or dragons to be slain. The Crusade Mid-Eastern Battles I expansion will instead focus on some of the major engagements of earlier Crusader history. In this first Crusade expansion, we showcase at least 16 Crusader scenarios and all the additional unit blocks you need to fight out these battles. New units include: Crossbow Infantry, Foot Knight Infantry, Turcopole Light Bow Cavalry, Heavy Knight Cavalry, and Heavy Military Order Knight Cavalry.<br/><br/>The Crusade expansion introduces many new game concepts as well: Impetuous Pursuit, Feigned Flight, Shower Shooting, and Charging Cavalry ability to pass through friendly stationary infantry units, all of which add historical depth and flavor. Still many game mechanics remain constant, like the deck of Medieval Command cards that drive movement while creating a &ldquo;fog of war&rdquo; and the battle dice that will resolve combat quickly and efficiently. There are also new and updated Inspired Actions for both the Crusader and Mid-Eastern armies.<br/> The stylized battlefield scenario maps still emphasize the important terrain features and highlight the historical deployment of forces in scale with the game system. Like your Medieval core game, the scale of the Crusade expansion is flexible and can vary from battle to battle. Yet to gain victory (and I have stated this many times before), the tactics you need to execute conform remarkably well to the advantages and limitations inherent to the various Crusader and Mid-Eastern army units, their weapons, terrain, and the history.<br/><br/>",

You will need 2 pawns in blue and 2 in orange and a supply of blue and orange stones.<br/><br/>The goal is to end up owning a greater number of connected stones when there are no moves left.<br/><br/>Setup:<br/><br/>The board starts out empty. One player plays with the blue pieces the other with the orange. Players in turn place a pawn on an empty cell until all 4 pawns are on the board.<br/><br/>Decide who goes first, turns then alternate.<br/><br/>Play:<br/><br/>A pawn must move (n) steps in a straight line such that it ends up at an empty cell with at least (n) cells immediately adjacent to it that are either empty or occupied by enemy stones (note that pawns are not stones). At least one of these must be empty. Then you must place a stone on (n) of these cells, with the restriction that at least one of the stones must be placed on an empty cell. If you place it on a cell with an enemy stone, that stone is removed first. The only thing that obstructs pawn movement is other pawns and the edge of the board.<br/><br/><br/>    Special thanks to Michael Amundsen for his excellent rules editing.<br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Patch: The Card Game is a tool to let players explore their modular synthesis skills in a fun way.<br/><br/>The game can be played solo or as a multiplayer game.<br/><br/>Separate and shuffle the Abstraction cards into their own pile.  Shuffle the Progression a Abstraction cards into another pile. Draw at least one Abstraction card and start patching, following the rule set by that card. The Abstraction card should stay in play for reference.<br/><br/>At some interval (eg. every 5min), draw a card from the Progression/Disruption pile and do the actions described on the card before placing it in a discard pile.  Repeat this as many times as you like until you feel the patch is finished.  If you run out of Progression/Disruptions cards, shuffle the discard pile as your new draw pile.<br/><br/>Patch Battle Royale, or &ldquo;PBR&rdquo; for short, is like the multiplayer version of the Basic Game.  2-4 participants is recommended with a single Patch TCG deck.  Multiple decks can be combined for more than 4 players, or if desired for 3 or 4 players to have more cards in their hand.<br/><br/>Start with the Basic Game setup and draw one Abstraction card which will be shared for all players.<br/><br/>Each player then gets dealt 5 cards from the Progression/Disruption pile (4 cards if there are 4 players).<br/>Everyone starts patching.  At some interval, (eg. every 5min), each participant gets to play a single card from their hand.  They can play this card on themselves, in which case they do the action.  Or, they can play it against another player, in which case that player has to do the action.<br/><br/>The battle concludes 5 minutes after the last cards are played. Patches are auditioned/performed/etc and compared.  &ldquo;Coolest&rdquo; patch wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The third of the Admiral-Hipper-class of heavy cruisers, Prinz Eugen was named for Prince Eugene of Savoy, and 18th century Austrian general. She saw action during the German operation Rhein&uuml;bung of 1941, in which, along with Bismarck, she attempted to breakout into the Atlantic to sow chaos amongst merchant convoys. The two ships destroyed the British cruiser Hood and damaged HMS Prince of Wales in the Battle of Denmark Strait. Shortly after, Prinz Eugen put into France to enact repairs following engine difficulties.<br/><br/>Briefly deploying to Norway, she was put out of action for repairs in Germany after being struck by a torpedo from a submarine. In the latter stages of the war, she served as artillery support for the retreating German army from the Baltic Sea. <br/>In May 1945 she was surrendered to the US Navy as a war prize, and was subjected to the nuclear tests of Operation Crossroads. Despite surviving the atomic blasts, she capsized after being towed to Kwajelein Atoll in December 1946. The wreck remains partially visible to this day.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Players are each given a menu of foods that need to be filled on their plate board. Each food piece is laid face down and mixed up, and the game begins. Each player chooses one card, and if it matches an item on their menu, they add it to their plate. If it doesn&rsquo;t match, they turn it face down and play moves to the next person. Each food item is represented on one card, with the exception of entrees, which are split up onto two cards. Players will need to find both halves in order to complete their meal.<br/><br/>While each menu requires certain foods, drinks and desserts are not menu-specific, so a player may take any they find. If on a later turn they find another drink or dessert, their turn simply ends.<br/><br/>The only item found on each menu is peas, and there are two cards in the game which state &ldquo;Please Pass the Peas&rdquo;. If a player finds one, they are allowed to take peas from another player who has them on their plate. If no player has peas, they may hold the card until either they find peas, or an opponent does. Once a &ldquo;please Pass the Peas&rdquo; card is used, it is removed from play. The first player to successfully fill their plate with all required menu items wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Tank Board Game is a board game of armored battles of WW2. Its central focus is armor with minimal infantry rules. The attacking player tries to capture 3 of the defender&rsquo;s 4 towns by game turn 15, while the defender tries to keep 2 of his towns.<br/><br/>Players move their tanks on a square grid gameboard trying to get a clear shot at the thinner side or rear armor plate of the enemy tank. Players can also move their tanks to higher-level positions and shoot down onto the enemy tank&rsquo;s thinner top. When a shot is taken, the tank's ability to destroy the other tank depends on its gun's penetration at target range, the thickness of the armor plate hit (turret/hull: front, side, rear, or top), and the angle the shell hits (level shot or falling shot &amp; full-face or quarter hit). Shot resolution is simplified using 3 randomly drawn chits (hit/miss, hit location, and critical hit) and then a quick table to find the effective armor vs. the gun&rsquo;s penetration. Armor plate thickness and gun penetration are all historical based.<br/><br/>The &ldquo;Starter Rules&rdquo; include only tank vs tank direct-fire combat. The &ldquo;Advanced Rules&rdquo; cover tank hunters, armored cars, self-propelled guns, armored personnel carriers, towed guns and aircraft. They cover indirect fire, rockets, and close infantry combat. In addition, they cover mechanical reliability, smoke, mines, demolitions, pontoon bridges, airborne, weather, and an optional concealment rule.<br/><br/>A total of 24 scenarios are provided: eight &ldquo;Starter&rdquo; scenarios and 16 historical &ldquo;Advanced&rdquo; scenarios. The starter scenarios include common favorites: M-4 vs Panther, T34 vs Panther, and M-4 vs T-34 (Korea). The historical scenarios start with the invasion of Poland with an optional armored train, and end with &ldquo;Into Germany&rdquo; putting armored goliaths against each other. Scenarios are designed to provide near-balanced fun games featuring 30-40 tanks and supporting units of the period, with the &ldquo;feel&rdquo; of the campaign in which the scenario took place. Two gameboards (Northern Europe and North Africa), 295 units of 163 types, as well as markers and chits are provided.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Collectively, Earth&rsquo;s nations and people set a course for the exploration of the solar system and exploitation of the resources it has to offer. Together, they set forth the Edict. The Edict is a demand and a licence for the most capable to venture into space under the mandate of harvesting extra-terrestrial resources for the enrichment of the people of Earth. Five organisations race out into the solar system to discover and capitalise on the raw materials buried within the planets, moons, asteroids, and debris beyond Earth&rsquo;s heavens. Who among them will gain ascendency in a race to establish a commercial empire in answer to the Edict?<br/><br/>You control one of these powerful organisations. Your aim is to explore, exploit and expand your influence into the solar system and export back resources essential to Earth. Your organisation&rsquo;s capabilities and options are dependent on the executives you recruit to manage your Mission Control.<br/><br/>The winner of the game is the player with the most Victory Points at the close of Earth&rsquo;s final Edict. Victory Points are earned through the accumulation of Solar Credits as well as achievements in scientific brilliance, political might and supremacy of exploration. By colonising new worlds, investing in ground-breaking technologies and recruiting the most distinguished minds in space exploration you will drive your organisation to control the stars and pave the way for new frontiers of humanity.<br/><br/>The game is advanced by fulfilling the demands of Earth as displayed on the Edict card, which are met by returning resources to Earth. Players take turns clockwise to use one of the four Mission Control departments that lists available actions dependent on the associated executive. Departments are improved by recruiting new executives. The recruitment round starts after each Edict is complete and gives all players an opportunity to bring in new talent.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Scrolls of Maega is a board game of tactical confrontation &amp; strategic movement set in a dark fantasy universe. It's an asymmetric tactical RPG for 3 to 6 players, with a modular board. Players have limited actions to prepare &amp; cast spells, manage their hand &amp; resources, and survive the maze.<br/><br/>LORE - SETTING:<br/>Players are power-hungry sorcerers in search of a long lost divine scroll of power. They will need to foil their opponents and the dangers of the maze to find the key, retrieve the artefact and race back to the exit; knowing that anyone left behind could be waiting on their way back.<br/><br/>OBJECTIVE:<br/>Players will attempt to retrieve the Scroll at the end of the dungeon and make their way back out with it. However, they must first find the Relic (key) among the hidden items randomized on the Treasure tiles.<br/><br/>SETUP:<br/>Players start by choosing their game mode: Battle Royale or Team battle (or Cooperative, coming in an expansion). The game is played in 4 phases of 3 turns each, for a maximum of 12 turns.<br/><br/>At first, players set the tiles to create the board, using a recommended or custom layout. Treasure tiles (items to collect) and Wall tiles (restricting movement/targeting) are safe to walk on, but most tiles bare Runes that will damage the players health &amp; mana.<br/><br/>They then select their characters, using the starting deck provided or customizing their strategy (for experienced players). Each begins with the same number: a free spell, 7 spells in-hand, 1 trap card in hand, and 1 trap card in their personal discard pile.<br/><br/>Players then order their 4 Divination cards, each offering them cumulative bonuses during one of the game's 4 phases. And once the turn-order is decided (by drawing numbered tokens), the first player can enter the maze. The game begins.<br/><br/>GAMEPLAY:<br/>Players aim to find the Relic among the hidden items, going to each Treasure tile and getting stronger in the process. With the Relic in their possession (secretly or not), they can take the Scroll from the shrine. But any item can be stolen from other players, so escaping with it will be challenging.<br/><br/>Players have 4 actions available per turn (moving up to 2-3 tiles, preparing a spell, casting any number of prepared spells, using an item, healing health or mana, etc.)<br/><br/>Mostly, players use their actions to prepare spells in advance (one action by level, up to 3); or to cast one or more spells they had prepared, so players will always need to anticipate their future needs. Spells are used to attack, move yourself or others, heal, or disable opponents. Only a disabled opponent can be looted.<br/><br/>Trap cards (Tenacity cards) can be used for free in reaction to a spell targeting them. Once used, it is removed from the game. Each player has two Tenacity cards (one in hand and one in the discard pile at the start of the game).<br/><br/>Except for your free spell, all used spells are then discarded. However, a tenacity track goes up with every health or mana lost or spent, allowing you to retrieve cards in your personal discard pile.<br/><br/>If a player falls to 0 HP with mana remaining, it's not over just yet. Next turn, they'll be disabled and will need to exchange their mana for health. But more rarely, if a player falls to 0 HP &amp; Mana, they'll die for good; winning is now out of reach, but as a vengeful spirit with limited actions, the player still has a role to play (either haunting its murderer or helping its team).<br/><br/>The game ends as soon as a player gets back to the starting portal with the Scroll in hand. So, select your character, build your strategy around their unique playstyle, and rush to the scroll or wait to steal it. In the end, only one Maegan will get the Scroll.<br/><br/>",

Su compa&ntilde;ero de la derecha, tomar&aacute; una tarjeta del mazo y le ense&ntilde;ar&aacute; la imagen del acertijo, sin mostrarle la respuesta. Si el jugador descubre el acertijo (concepto, frase o palabra) antes de que se cumpla 1 minuto, se queda con la tarjeta, y suma un punto. Si no acierta, la tarjeta vuelve al fondo del mazo de cartas (sin mostrar la respuesta) y contin&uacute;a el juego de la misma manera, siguiendo la ronda en el sentido de las agujas del reloj.<br/><br/>Tarjetas &quot;QUE VES para todos&quot; (para m&aacute;s de dos jugadores): Hay un conjunto de tarjetas &quot;Qu&eacute; Ves&quot; que est&aacute;n marcadas con el REY en color rojo. Si a un jugador le toca una de ellas, perder&aacute; la oportunidad de descifrar el acertijo en esa ronda, y deber&aacute;n hacerlo los restantes jugadores.

El primer jugador en descifrar 4 acertijos, gana la partida.<br/><br/><br/>OBJECTIVE OF THE GAME: Be the first player to decipher 4 graphic riddles.<br/><br/>PREPARATION: The deck (all 150 cards) is shuffled and placed on the tray (image side up), in the center of the table.<br/><br/>HOW TO PLAY: The youngest player begins the game. The player to his/her right will take a card from the deck and show him/her the picture-riddle, without showing him/her the answer. If the player deciphers the riddle (concept, phrase or word) before 1 minute expires, s/he keeps the card, and scores a point. If s/he fails to solve the riddle, the card returns to the bottom of the deck (without the answer being shown) and the game continues, in a clockwise direction.<br/><br/>&quot;WHAT YOU SEE, FOR EVERYONE&quot; CARDS (for games with more than 2 players): The game includes a set of cards that are marked with the king in RED. If a player gets one of them, s/he will lose the opportunity to decipher that card in that round and must instead show it to the rest of the players. The first player to answer correctly takes the card, obtaining 1 point. If none of the players manages to decipher the puzzle, the player who took the card from the deck keeps it and gets 1 point for him/herself.<br/><br/>WHO IS THE WINNER? The first player to decipher 4 riddles (get 4 points) wins the game.<br/><br/>-from the game's official rulebook<br/><br/>",

Make your purr&hellip; uhm, better!<br/><br/>The goal of the game is to have the most victory points at the end. Players get VP by stripping their opponents of their clothes (or accessories).<br/><br/>The accessory token moves from one space to another to denote the state of dress of each character. The possible states are as follows:<br/>1. Naked: The accessory token is off the character sheet and the character is flipped to the naked side<br/>2. Pants: The character is only wearing pants (token on pants space)<br/>3. Bra: The character is wearing bra and pants (token on bra space)<br/>4. Armor: The character is wearing bra and pants, and also armor (token on armor space)<br/>5. Weapon: The character has a weapon, armor, bra and panties (token on weapon space)<br/><br/>The game is divided into rounds, each round is split into phases. Note that some phases are played in clockwise order and some others in anticlockwise order.<br/><br/>Each player faces a round always with 3 cards in hand, drawing them from the central common deck. Cards could have some effects like removing accessories to an opponent (or to everyone), gain 1 accessory, defend from opposing actions, etc.<br/><br/>The cards can be played by the hand, can be held (covered) on the table (to be played during the next rounds) or can be discarded. All played cards form a sort of pile in order to activate their effects from the last played card to the first one.<br/><br/>The held cards go always on the top of the pile, so their effects start first. There's only one problem: the card on the top of the discard pile determines the Seed, that is the color of cards that cannot be played among the held ones.<br/><br/>This is a game full of funny surprises, bluff, ruthless combos and embarrassing situations.<br/><br/>This is a new version of Oppai Go that is stand alone but can be combined with the previous game to extend games up to 5-6 players.<br/><br/>",

At the start of a hand, shuffle the deck of 54 cards &mdash; the standard 52-card deck, plus high and low jokers &mdash; then deal 13 cards to each player. (With two players, each player draws two cards, keeps one of them, draws two more cards, keeps one, etc. until each player has 13 cards.)<br/><br/>The lead player of a hand plays a card, and everyone must follow suit if possible; if they can't, they can play any card. The highest card in the suit led wins the trick, and whoever played this card places it to the right of their player sheet.<br/><br/>Every other player looks at the props depicted on the card they played, marks off each prop on their player sheet, then places their card to the left of this sheet. A player sheet has a number of special powers (illusions) listed on it, with 3-5 props underneath each illusion. As soon as you've marked off all the props on an illusion, you can use it, whether now or in the future. What's more, each player who lost the trick takes an apprentice token and places it in their reserve, where they can have up to three tokens. You can add these tokens to cards played in future tricks to increase the value of your played card. Transform a 10 into a Jack, Queen, or King!<br/><br/>At the end of the hand, score points as follows:<br/><br/>&bull; For each card used to win a trick, 5 points.<br/>&bull; For each completed illusion, 3-5 points based on the number of props.<br/>&bull; For each suit, whoever has the most cards of this suit to the left of their player sheet scores 2 points for each card; ties are friendly.<br/><br/>After you've played the proper number of hands, whoever has the highest score wins.<br/><br/>In the solo game of Illusions of Prestige, you deal two hands of 13 cards, look at them both, then keep one of them, shuffling the other one to represent your opponent. When you lead a trick, you flip cards from the opposing deck until you find one of the matching suit. When the opponent leads, you deal two cards and use the higher one. Cycle through discards as needed.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Blitzkrieg Deluxe is a &quot;generic&quot; World War 2 era wargame that pits two fictional nations against each other over a fictional land mass represented by a huge 34 by 55 inch map. The game is easy to learn with the rules clocking in at under sixeteen pages, but difficult to master as the options available to each player are numerous. Do you mass your assault at the enemy's borders, or do you employ naval forces to invade through a tenuous beachhead? How best to utilize your air forces to disrupt your enemy's economy and halt their advance into your territory?<br/>​<br/>In addition to the huge map that is presented in easy-to-print tiles at both letter- and tabloid-sizes, the game includes over 500 markers on four sheets, four setup cards, and a double-sided player's aid card containing all of the game charts for quick reference.<br/>​<br/>This game is a redesign of the original Blitzkrieg game published by The Avalon Hill Game Company in 1968. The project started initially as an effort to create a new, updated, and far more pleasing map on which to play the original game. This effort snowballed into creating an updated set of game pieces, including the addition of markers needed to indicate control and industrial conditions never included in the original publication. Of course, this also required the creation of new game charts to match. It wasn't too long before the rules were tackled as well.<br/>​<br/>While working through the rules and copious errata for the original game, it seemed appropriate to rewrite the rules as well. Given enhancements in game play since 1968, these rules have been completely overhauled and enhanced with new mechanics and combat result charts to inject more excitement than the original design. The &quot;basic game&quot; has been stripped out and the rules reorganized to follow the sequence of play. The concepts of &quot;initiative&quot; (allowing for the possibility of double-turns by a player) and &quot;straining&quot; (allowing an attacker to push harder to gain better results, but at a risk of losses) have been introduced. The game also includes a random game-end mechanic, allowing a side more or less time to complete its conquest. Additionally, the original combat results (attrition) chart has been completely redesigned to allow for more realistic outcomes.<br/>​<br/>In a nutshell, Blitzkrieg Deluxe is not your daddy's (or granddaddy's) Blitzkrieg! As a player you have the option to play the game with the original rules as written using the updated map and markers, or you can &quot;upgrade&quot; to the new rules.<br/>​<br/>Blitz on!<br/><br/>",
