        "description": "From the introduction of the rules set:<br/>&quot;Fraser's book The Steel Bonnets gives a good history of the cattle raids back and forth across the Anglo-Scottish border during Elizabeth's reign. Having visited Hexham, capital of the Middle March last year, and toured the first purpose-built gaol in England, my interest in the Border Reivers was rekindled and I devised the following game.<br/><br/>&quot;Being both a wargamer and a role player I was interested in developing a fast, easy set of rules suitable for a skirmish encounter while instilling a sense of proprietary interest on the part of the players with their figures. Too often, I find, tabletop generals are willing to sacrifice their regiments with gleeful abandon, heedless of the actual cost. Role playing games generate a notion of investment and caution, with characters developed over a series of adventures. Steel Bonnets attempts to recreate the care and concern a reiver patriarch would feel for his sons and gillies when they are on raid.&quot;<br/><br/>Scale: One turn equals one minute; one figure equals one man; half an inch equals one yard. 20mm or 25mm figures are recommended.<br/><br/>Although a miniatures game, figures have individual characteristics and skills that develop over time.<br/><br/>This simple system includes rules for Spotting and Victory Point, as well as everything need for combat. Includes four scenarios: The Cattle Raid, Black Mail, Government Raid, &amp; Gaol Break.<br/><br/>Rules set appear in Wargames Illustrated #78 (March 1994)<br/><br/>",

It requires the Red Fleet to move its transports from one safe harbour to another while under the protection of battleships, destroyers and cruisers. Its enemy, the Black Fleet, attempts to capture the red side's transports. Rules govern the movement of each vessel, and there are a number of islands that have to be avoided. The Black Fleet is not allowed to enter the harbours. The game is won or lost if the transports are successful.<br/><br/>Equipment: 13 triangular cards each with a picture of a ship and a letter, these represents two fleets (red and black) and various ships: transports, battleships, destroyers and cruisers.<br/><br/>Published in London.<br/><br/>",

The colors don't &quot;belong&quot; to any player. Instead, any player can use playing pieces in any color.<br/><br/>There are two rule sets included: <br/>In the &quot;dice game&quot;, players take turns rolling four dice. With the results, they can put playing pieces on free spaces in the spiral. One die can be used to jump over another piece which is then returned to its base. When a player has occupied certain positions, he/she is awarded a number of scoring chips. The player with most chips at the end of the game is the winner.<br/>The &quot;board game&quot; is a push your luck game. The pieces, which contain numbers from 1-6, are placed on their bases, face down. One piece of each color is flipped over and put on the corresponding position in that color's spiral. <br/>A player can now flip over pieces and move them into their position until he/she flips over a piece that is larger than a previously played piece in the same color. In that case, all pieces that were jumped over are moved back to their bases (behind the un-flipped pieces, in numerical order) and it's the next player's turn. The same scoring applies as in the dice game.<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN - corrections welcome. The rules aren't easy to understand)<br/><br/>",

Knowledge of Charleston is the only currency in this game. Acquired property cards contain information that can aid owners in answering future questions.<br/><br/>When a player lands on an already owned property, there's a Showdown between the player who landed on the property and the property's owner. (If one or both players have no property, no Showdown occurs.) To resolve a Showdown, both players put up a property as a Wager, then roll the dice. The player with the highest roll (reroll any ties) draws an Examination Card and attempts to answer the question. If he answers correctly, he wins both properties. If he answers incorrectly, the properties go to his adversary. The answers to all of the questions on the Examination Cards are in the Official Rule and Answer Booklet that comes with the game.<br/><br/>The game ends when all property is claimed by the players.<br/><br/>The game states that it was Authenticated by Historic Charleston Foundation, Inc.<br/>Cover picture &quot;Adapted from a Lithograph by Smith, Painting by Hill 1850. From the Collection of the South Carolina Historical Society.<br/><br/>Description from Rules:<br/>The Charleston Game is a family-type game which reflects Charleston's beauty, history, and culture. It may be enjoyed by all ages and should provide an exciting educational benefit to the players.<br/><br/>The object of the Charleston Game is to obtain  the most property by correctly answering Examination Questions concerning the history and culture of Charleston and South Carolina. Players travel around the board landing on various types of squares. Fact Cards contain important history information which will aid a player in answering Examination Question. They also provide instructions for a player which may be helpful or harmful.<br/><br/>The game ends when all of the property is claimed by the players.

        "description": "From rules summary:  Plan.It is a planetary puzzle game where players take turns rotating and placing planet tiles to match as many like planets as possible.  The main components of the game are 45 unique planet tiles that contain 1/2 of a planet on each of the 6 sides.  The tile distribution ranges from having all sides represent the same planet to having up to 6 different planets represented.   Players are randomly assigned exclusive planets that they need to score points for.  On their turn, they will first perform a preliminary action in which they place or rotate a tile.  Next, they perform a primary action by placing a tile and calculating the resulting score.  The scores increase exponentially as more planets are matched at one time.  Players discard one card at the end of their turn and then draw back up to the hand limit (3 for 2-4 players, 4 for solitaire).  The game ends when the planet tile draw deck is exhausted.  Players calculate their score by multiplying the score of their lowest scoring planet by 3 and then adding that to the score of their highest scoring planet.<br/><br/>",

One player plays the Democrats and one plays the Republicans.  The Democrats win by creating a bill with a sufficient number of agenda items on it (each element of the bill has a certain number of Agenda Points), and having enough congressional support for the bill to pass.  The Republican player wins by preventing one or both of those things from happening.<br/><br/>Designer summary:<br/><br/>Pull the Plug on Granny uses the basic CDG mechanic from Twilight Struggle.  It was designed from the ground up as a print and play, with a small board and a short deck.  Rules and game combined will take 15 pages, and if you have some card sleeves around, you can probably be playing in under an hour for just the cost of the ink and paper.<br/><br/>",

There is also an economical element that includes betting. The fights themselves are resolved using offensive and defensive cards with labels like &quot;Jab&quot; or &quot;Uppercut&quot; and accompanying point values. Some cards lead to the drawing of chance cards that affect the course of the fight. It is possible to win matches by knockout or points.<br/><br/>",

A card randomly drawn from the deck gives the players a &quot;category&quot; and the first contestant to blurt out an answer wins the round. The winner is awarded that card and the player with the most cards at the end of the game is the champion.<br/><br/>Example of play: The letter is a &quot;T&quot;. The card reads &quot;A part of a car.&quot; so the first geek to shout &quot;Tire!&quot; or &quot;Transmission!&quot; or whatever wins that round.<br/><br/>Includes 48 cards, the spinner, a score pad, and rules.<br/><br/>Eldon Item #885<br/><br/>",

The territories are the Plains, the Wetlands, the Forest, and the Mountains.<br/><br/>Each card represents a different territory and contains an equation to be solved.  In order to settle a territory one must possess a card containing the solution to the algebraic equation given on any unoccupied territory.  Forming empires can lead to overthrowing your opponent&rsquo;s settlements.  But beware, if your opponent can fend off your attack, their settlements become even stronger than before.<br/><br/>The person who settles the most territories rules the land!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "MelodieXpress - is it music poured into a game? ... or is it a game filled with music? It&rsquo;s so hard to know!<br/><br/>Theme<br/><br/>At its heart MelodieXpress is a game about music. Actually it&rsquo;s a whole lot of games about music. MelodieXpress uses a series of card games to teach the elements of music theory, and to teach the players the skills of sight-reading and composing music.<br/><br/>The pack includes playing cards based around music notation -  notes, clefs, key signatures, and accidental notes - as the basis for games and activities. While the overall intention it to foster musical knowledge and skills, the focus within the games is upon fun and enjoyment.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The Note Reading pack is the first of the MelodieXpress sets. It includes 104 cards including the treble, alto and base clefs, and 52 crotchet notes - 4 cards for each of 13 notes.<br/><br/>There are rules for 12 games included within the pack, and players are free to develop further games and activities utilising the flexibility of the cards. The guidebook introduces the basics of music notation and theory then leads on to the rules of the games.<br/><br/>The Basic Games<br/><br/>The 5 basic games introduce the notes and their naming to the point where players can instantly recognise and name the specific notes from the cards. These games utilise the crotchet notes and the clefs.<br/><br/>These basic games are designed to so that they can initially be played using a subset of 4 notes (16 cards). This allows players to become familiar with the notes and their names, then expanding to include additional notes. A clef is used next to the game board to define the specific notes (so with the treble clef play starts with middle C, D, E and F, while with the alto clef the same cards would be E, F, G and A). As players become confident and adept at naming the notes additional cards are introduced to expand the games and add complexity.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Introducing the Notes&rsquo; and &lsquo;Flash Cards&rsquo; are the initial games and provide a first experience of notes and naming. They are followed by the classic &lsquo;Snap&rsquo; and &lsquo;Memory&rsquo; games adapted to be played using the music cards. While the players compete to win the games, the focus is upon ready recognition and matching of the notes on the cards. The final basic game - &lsquo;Making Melodies&rsquo;  encourages players to construct combinations of notes. It is also an opportunity to play the music from the cards for those players who are learning an instrument.<br/><br/>The basic games are fun and enjoyable in their own right, but also provide a platform for building an understanding of musical concepts and notation.<br/><br/>The Advanced Games<br/><br/>The 7 advanced games build upon the recognition and understanding of notes gained in the basic games. They focus upon sequences and progressions of notes and introduce the next level of sight reading. The later games also introduce the use of key signatures and accidental notes (sharps, flats and naturals) to further extend the game-play and learning.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Row&rsquo; and &lsquo;Reach for the Stars&rsquo; are played by combining cards onto sequences of notes. Players place cards from their hands to build sequences of notes, either individually or in common. &lsquo;Scale the Mountain&rsquo; extends on this by introducing key signatures, and requiring players to build sequences to complete the major scales. As play moves around the table individual players take turns to build upon the scale, or to introduce a new key signature and rearrange the sequence to match the new scale.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Chord you do it?&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chords Aplenty&rsquo; focus upon players building three note sequences of chords to score points. Game-play is dynamic and can involve the trading or transfer of cards between players.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Rows and Scales&rsquo; and &lsquo;Rows and Scales Advanced&rsquo; round out the advanced games, providing interactive games of sequencing and matching cards. Players seek to build sequences from scales and chord, utilising the note cards and accidentals to build legal sets.<br/><br/>Taking it Further<br/><br/>The game system is flexible and open ended. The variety of cards allows players and teachers to develop their own games and activities beyond those provided in the pack. <br/>Additional games will also be published on the MelodieXpress website, sharing new games and activities as they are developed.<br/><br/>The MelodieXpress System<br/> MelodieXpress is a fun, educational and easy way to learn to read music. <br/>Using the approach that we learn best through play, MelodieXpress uses games and activities to introduce the key concepts of musical notation and music theory.

        "description": "The MelodieXpress Composing Music Pack takes up where the MelodieXpress Note Reading Pack leaves off. Composing Music adds more and cards and more games to extend the fun and increase the learning.<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>At its heart MelodieXpress is a collection of games about music. The packs include playing cards based around music notation - notes, clefs, key signatures and more. MelodieXpress uses a series of card games to teach the elements of music theory, and to teach the players the skills of sight-reading and composing music.<br/><br/>The Composing Music Pack brings further cards, along with its own guide book. New notes include semi breves, minims and quavers, and more accidental notes (sharps, flats and naturals). It also introduces time signatures - 2:4, 3:4, 4:4 and 6:8 time - plus bar lines and the key signatures for the Alto clef - (C major, G major, D major, A major, F major, B flat major and E flat major).<br/><br/>The focus is still on fun, but the additional cards in the Composing Music pack provide the basis for new games as well. The cards are combined with those from the Note Reading Pack to provide the expanded deck used in the new games.<br/><br/>Gameplay<br/><br/>The Guide Book provides some additional definitions and an introduction to the required music theory. It also presents 13 new games. Depending upon the game playing time can run from 5 to 30 minutes. The majority of the games cater for 2-6 players, though some can extend to include more if needed.<br/><br/>The early games build upon the skills developed in the Note Reading Pack, with games based around the key signatures, scales and chords. The later games make use of the new cards to introduce rhythm and melody.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Rhythm&rsquo; is a game for 2-6 players and introduces the use of key signatures and time signatures. Players progressively play cards from their hands to build up sequences of music. The grouping of notes must be consistent with the time signatures which start each sequence. As the game progresses players may add cards to their own or others sequences, aiming to build tunes of at least 18 notes.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Sure Time&rsquo; starts with a time signature and a sequence of 10 notes. Each player in turn chooses bar line and rest cards to introduce into the sequence and marks out each of the bars within the sequence of notes. Points are scored for correctly sequencing the cards. Each player faces a different combination of cards and time signatures as play progresses around the table.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Beat the Bar Line&rsquo; allows players to compose their own music. Each player progressively weaves together a communal collection of note cards with bar lines, rests and time signatures from their individual hands to build a growing composition. The game also introduces repeat bar lines and double bar lines with special rules for their play.<br/><br/>&lsquo;Composing Music&rsquo; adds additional challenges for those players who are learning an instrument or are taking choral lessons. Play starts with a player building a 3 bar segment of music built from the game cards. Points are scored based upon the composition. The following player in the sequence may then gain bonus points by correctly playing the piece. They then add a bar to the piece of music. Play continues with players alternately attempting to play the developing composition and then adding bars until all of the cards set out for that session have been used. Variations to the game allow for the substitution of different key signatures as the game progresses, as well as the use of accidental notes.<br/><br/>Taking it Further<br/><br/>Together the Note Reading and Composing Music Packs are intended to provide a fun series of games and activities which introduce the basics of sight reading and music notation. Additional packs and resources extend the system still further.<br/><br/>The game system is designed to be flexible and open ended. The variety of cards allows players and teachers to develop their own games and activities beyond those provided in the pack. <br/>Additional games will also be published on the MelodieXpress website, sharing new games and activities as they are developed.<br/><br/>The MelodieXpress System<br/> MelodieXpress is a fun, educational and easy way to learn to read music. Using the approach that we learn best through play, MelodieXpress uses games and activities to introduce the key concepts of musical notation and music theory. This step-by-step approach allows you to learn at your own pace, while the games provide an enjoyable way to learn and consolidate your knowledge of music.<br/><br/>MelodieXpress Composing Music is not a complete game.

They adapt Full Thrust to hex-play and replace damage rolls with a draw deck. Two scenarios are included with the rules.<br/><br/>Requirements:<br/><br/>Players will require these rules, several six-sided dice (d6), ship diagrams (provided), miniatures or counters representing ships, and a hex-grid. Micromachines make excellent and inexpensive miniatures in roughly 1/3700 scale.<br/><br/>Game Overview:<br/><br/>Players control 1-5 space ships and plot simultaneous turns. Movement is 2-D cinematic flight with basic momentum incorporated into the the movement mechanic. Games end when one side reaches its break point or accomplished its scenario objectives.<br/><br/>Combat is based on variable numbers of d6s (depending on weapon and range).

        "description": "Entry for the Chessex Tribute competition.<br/><br/>Game Overview<br/>The object of the game is to capture your opponents&rsquo; dice by either trapping them with a die on two opposing sides (performing a pincer movement) or by dropping a die of the same number on top of it.<br/><br/>Components<br/>. Game board (15 x 15 squares)<br/>. 36 dice x number of players (72 for 2 player, 108 for 3 player, 144 for 4 players) &ndash; each player should have a different colour of dice<br/>. These Rules<br/>. Diagonal Arrow Tiles x 30 (Optional)<br/><br/>Set Up<br/>. - If using arrow tiles, place them 3 at a time (alternating who puts them down) on the board wherever you like.<br/>. - Players roll their dice 6 at a time and place them on their side of the board. Alternate putting dice on the board. You can place them within the five rows closest to them on the board (exactly where is generally irrelevant, but can ultimately be used as some sort of strategy depending on how you put them down). Keep doing this until each player has at least 30 dice on the board.<br/>.... - You may opt to hold 6 dice in reserve so you can place them in game at a later time.<br/>.... - When you play these reserves you can put any number of them on the board at a time, so long as they are on your own side of the board. Remember to roll them first to determine which side is facing up.<br/>. - Starting a die on the board so that it pincers an opponent&rsquo;s die does not count as a capture.<br/>. - Designate starting player.<br/><br/>Arrow Tiles<br/>. Landing on an arrow tile grants you an additional direction to move in - always a diagonal. If the arrow points up and to the left, then you may move up, down, left, right, or up-left.<br/><br/>Rules for Play<br/>. - Players alternate moving one die each turn.<br/>. - If you drop one of your dice on another one of your dice, the die at the bottom is removed and can be replayed on a later turn with a different number on its face.<br/>. - Any dice captured by your opponent are removed from the game. You don&rsquo;t get them back during this game.<br/>. - A die can jump in any of the four directions provided they a) stay on the board, and b) don&rsquo;t land on an enemy die with a number different to the die you are moving. You can drop any of your dice on top of any of your own dice, provided they are in range.<br/>. - You can only move your pieces in a straight line.<br/>. - If you jump your dice between two enemy dice, you don&rsquo;t lose that die. The opponent must manoeuvre into a position where they jump beside you.<br/><br/>Reinforcements<br/>You can play any number of reinforcements in your home zone (the first five lines on your side of the board) on your turn instead of moving one of your dice.<br/>If you place a reinforcement next to an opponent&rsquo;s die that already has one of your dice on an opposing side, it does not count as a capture.<br/><br/>Buffer<br/>One line of squares running from corner to corner of the board should act as a buffer if you intend to have more than 2 people playing a game. I.e. during initial deployment, you cannot place one of your own dice next to an opponent&rsquo;s dice.<br/><br/>Dice Rules<br/>. - Number 1 Dice: can move one square, capture enemy Number 1 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>. - Number 2 Dice: can move 2 squares, capture enemy Number 2 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>. - Number 3 Dice: can move 3 squares, capture enemy Number 3 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>. - Number 4 Dice: can move 4 squares, capture enemy Number 4 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>. - Number 5 Dice: can move 5 squares, capture enemy Number 5 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>. - Number 6 Dice: can move 6 squares, capture enemy Number 6 Dice by jumping on them, or can push a friendly die into reserve by jumping on it.<br/>- Capture: Jumping on an enemy die with the same number on its face. Moving your dice into position so that there is one of your dice on either side (left and right or front and back) of a die with any number on its face.<br/><br/>Board Shape<br/>It was recently brought to my attention that the game can be played on grids that aren't necessarily square. To play on a triangular board, your pieces can move normally in all 6 directions, thus rendering the need for the arrow toils null.<br/><br/>Winning<br/>. Players who have less than 6 dice left on the board (with no reserves) lose. A player may concede defeat any time after they are reduced to ten dice less than their opponent (e.g. if they have 15 dice and their opponent has 25 dice, they can concede defeat).<br/><br/>",

One player takes the role of the mythical hero Perseus, and his opponent assumes control of his quarry, the serpentine Medusa.<br/><br/>At his disposal, Perseus has four Greek soldiers to help corner and behead the, once beautiful beast, whose very expression now turns people to stone. His equipment includes treasures gifted to him by various Olympians and the Hesperides: a polished shield, adamantine sword, and a knapsack kibisis to safely contain Medusa's head.<br/><br/>The game has an asymmetrical design, with both decks featuring different cards and abilities. Perseus and the Sanctum of the Medusa is played without a board or map, with cards placed out by the Perseus player to simulate the Greeks' investigation of the column and statue strewn chamber. Gameplay is quick and bloodthirsty with Greeks petrified, or slain by bowshot and acid pool frequently.<br/><br/>Drawn partially from Greek myth, the game is inspired hugely by the 1981 film Clash of the Titans.<br/><br/>The game's lineage can be traced back to Magic: The Gathering, BattleTech TCG, and Iliad.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "100 Points Prediction is a simple, casual card game in the 100 Points line of games that uses 100 Points cards.<br/><br/>In 100 Points Prediction each player rolls a 6-sided die and draws a number of cards equal to their roll. Each player then guesses as to what the total number of points are of all the cards in all the players' hands. One by one players reveal their cards and everyone finds out the the total number of points. The player who guessed the closest without going over wins. The losing players put their cards in their discard pile. The last player with cards in their deck wins.<br/><br/>The game can be played with 2 or more players.<br/><br/>Each player needs their own set of 100 Points cards and a 6-sided die to play the game. <br/>(Publisher description)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Tall Towers each player represents a carpenter during the Medieval Age who has been tasked with building a city tower for the Prince. Each player must build a tower taller and more efficiently than the other players. Everyone grabs one of the 6 foundation boards, each with a unique build queue that you are trying to complete during the frantic trading sessions.<br/>After everyone has chosen a foundation board, the game can begin. There are 2 phases repeated throughout the game. The first phase is the Trading/Resource Gathering Phase. Everyone starts with the same deck of 40 Cards, but you will not be using your own cards to build your Tall Tower. Instead the trading/resource gathering is done through an interesting real-time blind trading mechanic. It is a quick thinking and chaotic trading session quite similar to games such as Pit, or Set. Everyone is trading simultaneously, so act fast to get the cards you need, and bluff your opponents into taking the bad cards from your hand.  <br/>The second phase is the Build Phase, where you use the cards you received in the previous phase to build your Tall Tower. Of course it is not as easy as it sounds. You must play the cards in the order you received them, you cannot rearrange your hand. Some cards are good and will help you finish up the next floor of your Tower, or they could be bad and send cracks through a few of the stones you gathered during the Resource Phase.<br/>The Players go through 8 Rounds (of 5 cards each) alternating between these 2 phases, and the one with the Tallest Tower wins. There is lots of chaos during trading, lots of speculation between players as they try to talk each other into taking their cards, and lots of fun as you flip over your resources and see how good you did or how bad you crumbled.<br/><br/>",

The cards can be kept for future use, but when certain points on the track are reached, the players have to discard them and receive negative points for them. <br/>Whenever a player draws a card, another player can also force one of his/her cards on him/her, making the &quot;trip&quot; less predictable. <br/>The first player to reach the end of the track gets some bonus points.

Deep within the cloud, the spineless Boche had shown his true colours and escaped Stumpys righteous justice. The growling Merlin engine sang a new song as he side-slipped his trusty Supermarine Spitfire down towards the now helpless Dornier 17.<br/> The Dornier was almost at the target and in scant moments would land at the brewery and snatch No14 Squadrons Claret from under their noses. Well Stumpy would see about that. He loosed the safety off of his eight .303&rsquo;s and aimed at the Dorniers port engine.<br/>  Suddenly from behind screaming out of a wingunder manoeuvre the FW 190 appeared in Stumpys vanity mirror, its cannons sparkling motes of fire. A shell smashed into the Spits wing and tore the aileron. &ldquo;Blast you, Von Strudel &ldquo;yelled Stumpy as he realised that he had been sold a duffer and was gone for a burton. Only one trick could save him. Feathering his Kites prop, he hit the airbrakes and was rewarded with the bright green FW 190 flashing under him. Dropping the nose Stumpy let rip a corking burst which caught the Jerry a treat. Flames poured from the FW 190&rsquo;s  engine and Von Strudel Hit the Silk. <br/>Von Strudel shook his fist as Stumpy flashed past. &ldquo;Verdammt Englander! Finish me now!

The glamour, mystique and courage of the battle of Britain is brought to life in this elegant design of that great campaign that marked the end of the beginning of the greatest Conflict in History. Take command of the German or Commonwealth air fleets as you battle it out over the skies of London and England desperately trying to save your country from destruction from the sky.<br/><br/>Battle for Britain is a stand alone boxed game that is fast paced, easy to learn but tough to master game covering the entire air war over Britain during those critical months of August and September 1940 when the world held its breath as to the outcome. Containing a unique hidden movement system, a wide variety of units and a rich array of strategic detail, Battle for Britain gives you everything you need to re-fight the greatest air battle in history. Can Germany knock out England&rsquo;s air defences preparatory to an invasion of the plucky little island or can England repel the Nazi sky hordes and begin preparing for the time when she can return democracy to Europe? Now as Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding or Generalfeldsmarschall Hermann Goering you can find out.<br/><br/>Battle for Britain contains:<br/>&bull; 1 large map (1168mm x 820mm) (46&quot; x 32&quot;)<br/>&bull; 400 full colour counters<br/>&bull; 1 Rule book<br/>&bull; 2 Hidden unit displays<br/>&bull; 2 Combat Charts<br/>&bull; 1 Rule book<br/>&bull; 5 x 12-sided dice<br/><br/>",

The master builder choses a piece as the base, the architect adds another piece on top of it (the pieces are interlocking). Then all players take turns adding another piece. The &quot;building&quot; has to remain stable and it is not allowed to block the next player. The players may hold the building while adding their piece; when they think it is stable they let go. If it collapses, the player who caused that is penalized, so is the architect. If all pieces are used up, all players get points with the architect getting a bonus. Several rounds are played and points are noted.

        "description": "An &quot;educational&quot; card game by Bubbles Inc. Published in 1972. A rummy game featuring Charlie Chaplin imagery.<br/><br/>The game play is that of a basic rummy game. Seven card hands are dealt, runs of three with matching suit are required by the rules. The winner is the first to finish their hand.<br/><br/>The suits are related to Charlie Chaplin's general image; Canes, Shoes (untied), Neckties, and Hats.<br/><br/>This game is interesting because the card backs are unique to each card. This theoretically enables a player to memorize the deck. Each card is unique because it has a flip book of Charlie Chaplin on the card backs. He is twirling his cane. Each card is numbered on the back so that the flip book movie can be played in order.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Also known simply as &quot;Fate&quot;; Pendulum of FATE is an acyclic two-player perfect information luckless abstract strategy game played on a grid of any size that starts out empty.  It can also be played on a hex grid.<br/><br/>Fate's most significant feature is the fact that players gain increasing tokens to place and use as the game progresses.  &quot;Reinforcements&quot; are calculated as a function of both the number of spaces the player already occupies at the start of his or her turn and the turn number of the game.  This increasing reinforcement calculation causes the dominance of the game to swing back and forth like a wild, accelerating pendulum, hence the name of the game.  The goal becomes timing the swings of the game such that a player is able to completely win the game before the momentum shifts right back.  The game is driven to a conclusion with one player filling the entire board and removing the final pieces of his or her opponent so only tokens of one color remain on the board.<br/><br/>Standard Pendulum of FATE is a two-player game, but it can also be played by more with additional supplies of theoretically limitless tokens in different colors for each player.<br/><br/>",

For example, &quot;A tail for front legs!&quot; or &quot;Back legs for a head!&quot; or the titular &quot;A tail for a head!&quot; The exchange is made with the first player to accept the offer. Play then passes to the left.<br/><br/>As players assemble a full set (one animal), called a &quot;trick&quot; in this game, they lay it in front of them. The winner is the first person to assemble a given number of tricks:<br/><br/><br/>     Three players: 4 tricks<br/>     Four players: 3 tricks<br/>     Five players: 3 tricks (utilizing 3 spare cards in a kitty)<br/>     Six players: 2 tricks<br/><br/><br/>",

One at a time each player passes a single card to his or her right.  The player receiving the card immediately checks to determine if the new card creates a pair with any cards currently held in their hand.  If a pair has made, the pair is laid out on the playing surface, face up, for all the other players to see.  The player who received the card, whether or not they successfully made and laid a pair, chooses a card from his or her hand and passes it to the player to the right. The receiving player, e.g., the player to the right, follows the same procedure for either making or failing to make a pair, and then play continues, again to the right.  The first player to have reduced their hand to zero cards, e.g., a nil hand, by playing out their final two cards in a successful pair is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Evolution Earth is a board game for 2-4 players aged 10 or up. Playing time is from 45 minutes up to 2 hours depending on the number of players and playing experience.<br/><br/>Evolution Earth is a dynamic board game of strategy, tactics and probability. It is a game of area control, card and resource management.<br/><br/>The game is very dynamic and always full of surprises and no two games are alike. You will need your tactical skills and learn what to play and when to play and where to play. You will also mastermind deeper strategic plans in order to dominate a superiority in many aspects of Animal Kingdom or just simply trying to conquer continents for your species.<br/><br/>You, as the player of your precious species, will try to profit from forces of nature for the benefit for your species and try to protect your species from natural disasters. Create the best possible life strategy for your species as they compete against other players&acute; species. Use your species&acute; cooperative skills and choose the best competitive strategy against your opponents species that try to survive as well. Conquer the land and conquer the seas. Control your natural resources and rule the elements. Harness the primeval forces of nature for your victory. The prosperity of your species rests on your hands.<br/><br/>Evolution Earth&acute;s rules: The laws of nature are an uncompromising and absolute and merciless as Mother Nature is. Only the most adaptive, cooperative, competitive and most fit can survive in a world of a persistent struggle for reproduction, nutrition and living space. For those species that can not adapt and survive must die out and become extinct and give way to a new species that are more adapted to new conditions in an ever changing Earth and try to survive and thrive and speciate and expand to conquer new territories in a land and sea.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, a 1 000 000 000 years ago, the Earth is more or less still an ocean planet. Ice Age has ended long time ago and snowball Earth has melted into a great planet of temperate ocean. Only a few protocontinents or cratons have become to exist over the endless surface of the vast ocean as a predicting sign for the upcoming continents, that will one day thrive with a different kind of life forms. Primordial plant life has already radiated, expanded from oceans into protocontinents and animal kingdom will soon expand their living space into a protocontinents niche too.<br/><br/>The animal kingdom still consists only a single-celled organisms that will soon burst into a multitude of populations of many kinds of multicellular first animals expanding their living space from the depths of ocean floor into all over the vast seas and harboring protocontinents: The Cambrian critters. These numerous types of animals will also victoriously, as a reward and prize for surviving and succeeding, evolve in time into the very first fishes, insects, reptiles, dinosaurs, mammals and birds.<br/><br/>The face of the Earth will change numerous times during millions of years. Protocontinents rise into a great full continents from the depths of the ocean. These large masses of land move and drift apart and reunite again. Volcanic eruptions, pandemic diseases spreading from populations to populations, climate changes, ice ages and asteroid impacts will afflict all life from time to time. Will your species survive and dominate the Earth or will they will they die out and become extinct fossils?<br/><br/>The great contest of survival is beginning. Are you ready to conquer the Earth?<br/><br/>This description is an edit from the rulebook.<br/><br/>",

The ants with the most valuable food win!<br/><br/>Wherever there is food, there are bugs!  Help a pair of ants race to get food off the picnic table before the wind, the rain, a psycho kid with a magnifying glass and other bugs (among other events) destroy the food.<br/><br/>Quick overview of rules:<br/>Each player takes a turn to roll two eight sided dice.  The resulting values are used to move a pair of ants orthogonally across an 8 x 8 board representing a picnic table cloth.  If a player rolls and 8 and a 5 he/she may move one ant up to 8 spaces and the other up to 5.  If the ants land on matching food tokens, these tokens are removed from the board and placed in front of the player.  The value of the tokens depends on which coloured squares they are removed from:<br/>Pink + white or red = 1 point per token<br/>Pink + pink = 2 points per token<br/>White + red = 2 points per token<br/>White + white = 3 points per token<br/>Red + red = 3 points per token<br/><br/>However, there are restrictions to movement.  A pop can or an ant blocks passage and cutlery, paper towels and gum slow down movement across the board.<br/>Event cards are drawn at specified points in the game.  These event cards can further hinder movement, destroy food, or reduce its value.<br/>The number of event cards used determines the length of the game.<br/>There are three versions of the game:<br/>1) The regular game<br/>2) A kids version<br/>3) An advanced version<br/>The ants who have collected the highest valued food at the end of the game are the winners!<br/><br/>",

The marbles can only be moved forward, to the side, or at a diagonal but not backwards. Marbles can jump any other marble including your own provided there is an empty space after the marble being jumped. You can also make multiple jumps as long as there continues to be an empty space after each marble jumped. Marbles may be moved only one space at a time if no jump is possible. The first to move all their marbles to the opposite side wins.<br/><br/>--description from publisher<br/><br/>",

To do this you must capture any two of his &quot;JEL&quot; pieces. JEL represents Judicial, Executive, and Legislative branches of our government. Lose one JEL piece and your country can still function, but lose the second JEL and you lose control of your government and the war.&quot;<br/><br/>Warfare is an abstract strategy game similar in play style to stratego or chess with players taking alternating turns, where they may move, attack, or retreat (though there is no secret unit deployment as with Stratego). To win one must capture two of the opponents &quot;JEL&quot; pieces, which also have the ability to move and attack. The playing pieces are of various military and civilian ranks (JEL, Secret Service, General, Admiral,Army, Nacy, Airforce, and Marines). Each has a particular set of rules in how it can be moved, how far, or under what conditions/direction it can attack. Black squares on the game board represent land, while white squares represent water. Certain pieces may only move or attack on either by virtue of their class (Navy can only move/attack on water, while army can only move/attack on land).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game consists of tiles with four edges in four different colors. The tiles are placed between the players so each player faces one color edge (all tiles have to be aligned accordingly). Each edge contains a number which forms a larger number together with all the tiles in one row. There are also commas, which can turn a potentially large number into a very small one. The idea is to place commas in positions which are at the rear of one's own line, but at the front of another player's, so the other player's number is minimal and the own one is large.<br/>A turn consists of simply flipping over one tile and placing it into the grid. When all tiles are placed, four spaces in the 6 x 6 grid remain empty, thus further influencing the results.<br/>The player with the largest sum of all six lines is the winner.<br/><br/>(User summary by HilkMAN)<br/><br/>",

The first person to fill their train with Teddy Bears wins the game.<br/><br/>There are two variants to this game which introduce numbers to the game.<br/><br/>There isn't much of a game here, but it is for very young children, and it has nice plastic Teddy Bears.<br/><br/>",

Players control the actions of heroic crimefighters or nefarious villains and their henchmen. Each player will have anywhere from 1 to a dozen models whose actions they determine.<br/><br/>Combat is fast and deadly. Using the results of two six-sided dice, players try and fight through the defenses of their opponents. Heroes and Major villains can withstand punishment but their henchman will be falling left and right to slugs, knives and fists.<br/><br/>All characters are pre-generated so players will be ready to go straight from the book. Special abilities will give the major characters an edge over those around them, but even the greatest hero can fall to the villain's henchmen if he is unsupported.<br/><br/>Two experienced players will be able to play out their favorite action from the world of Granton City in about 2 hours on a game space no bigger than a dining room table.<br/><br/>&ldquo;When approached about incorporating the diverse characters from Granton City Press into a table top miniatures game, I thought it was a great idea,&rdquo; said Richard A. Johnson the man behind Rattrap Productions LLC. &ldquo;Initially we tossed around the idea of incorporating the characters into one of our existing games but came to realize there was enough unique and interesting new character in Granton City to support a new game themselves.&rdquo;<br/><br/>Johnson said he had been working on a new game, and it turned out to be a perfect vehicle for characters such as The Black Wolf, The Starling, Ghost Wind and Churchill: Alien Bounty Hunter.    <br/>    <br/>The new game will be an ideal place for the soon to be released Black Wolf miniature from Zombiesmith Miniatures. Watch for more news on the miniature front in the weeks ahead.    Granton City Press expects to have The Black Wolf #1: Metal Monsters of Doom out in April. Black Wolf #2, and spin-off titles Unit 13, Ghost Win and Churchill: Alien Bounty Hunter follow in the fall, with a release expected to coincide closely with Rattrap&rsquo;s release of While the City Sleeps.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "As chess evolved from shatranj in the West, pieces gained power by becoming long-range sliders, producing an abstract game where most pieces can cross an open board in a single turn. Eastern variants stay closer to the beginnings of the game, which featured a number of short-range sliders and leapers, but the power pieces still seem to be long-range. What if long-range pieces did not come to be so dominant? Suppose the short-range pieces of chess' infancy became more powerful by gaining additional short-range moves? Great Shatranj examines some potentials of these pieces, offering 5 different pieces that slide 1 square or jump 2 squares. Each player has up to 8 leapers on the board, giving the game a noticeably different flavor.<br/><br/>The game is played on an 8x10 board and is played with standard chess rules, except as modified by the specific piece movement rules. Great Shatranj is a short-range Capablanca [actually Carrera] Chess variant. Kings, knights and pawns are the usual pieces, but bishops, rooks and all the pieces that use them as components have been replaced by analogs that step 1 square or leap 2 squares, only, in the bishop or rook directions. This is the second game in a series of shatranj variants offering an alternate history for chess. It may be played with a standard 8x10 Capablanca Chess set.<br/><br/><a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSgreatshatranjm\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.chessvariants.org/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MSgr...</a><br/><br/>",

Grand Shatranj is the companion game to Great Shatranj. It extends the examination of short-range leapers by looking at another 2-square jumper and 2 short-range riders.<br/><br/>Grand Shatranj is a short-range variant of Christiaan Freeling's Grand Chess [name and setup used with permission and thanks] played on a 10x10 board. A Grand Chess set may be used to play. This game uses the pasha, a piece that steps 1 square or leaps 2 squares in a straight line, and introduces 2 apparently new variant chess pieces, the oliphant and lightning warmachine, bishop and rook analogs which step 1 square or leap 2 squares, then may step 1 or leap 2 again. No piece moves more than 4 squares, but pawn walls lose effectiveness. The game plays rather differently than its namesake, and is the third in a series of shatranj variants.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Damned Hot Work is a miniatures wargaming system primarily designed for 25/28mm models, and is a fast and simple game that should allow large battles to be fought easily in one evening - or a couple of skirmishes - recreating the drama of combat with dice rolls and a deck of cards.<br/><br/>This is a wargame heavily dependant on a glorious theme - it's actually buried miles deep beneath the Earth's crust in theme! Fight melees between British regiments of Foot, coal-fired robots, fez-wearing villains, snarling, leaping mummies, knife-twirling Chinese warriors, hordes of spear-chucking natives, ferocious African-like wildlife, ravenous dinosaurs, mad scientists, vampire lords, and rifle-wielding Zikhs; or any bizarre combination that tickles your fancy.<br/><br/>DHW is set in a romantic fictional universe, half a world away and over a century ago. Most battles and skirmishes take place in the hot, mountainous country of Quarajanistan. Though bloodthirsty action has also been spied on the dinosaur-infested Namajaro Plateau, in the steaming jungles and Lost Valley of the Baka-Mang, and the deadly, secret Kingdom of the Kuji-Gani.<br/><br/>The game is based loosely on the well-known wars of British Colonialism: Northern India, the Zulu War, the Boer War, the Egyptian and Sudanese campaigns, but also includes many fantastical elements. In the world of DHW, it is not uncommon to spy an armoured airship, coal-fired borrowing contraption, Martian Tripod, steam-powered tank, or even lancers on unicycles!  During the course of play, expect to encounter heinous villains, angry creatures, fearsome monsters - and the worst monsters of all: true-blooded Englishmen. Play may be accompanied by a stiff brandy and cigars.<br/><br/>Inspired by books and films such as The Lost World, War of the Worlds, The Mummy, Zulu, Zulu Dawn, Master of the World, At the Earth&rsquo;s Core, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea, Valley of the Gwangi, and many others, DHW is a light wargame.<br/><br/>An often-cited shortfall of wargaming design, is that the player who rolls better dice than their opponent will always win. This is generally true, and some would say this reflects the chaos of battle and the vagaries of command. Damned Hot Work addresses this issue with Feather Tokens, gifted to each player whenever they fail certain die rolls. These tokens can be spent in multiples of four on later turns to buy instant-kills, or succeed morale checks, or move a unit more aggressively.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Greenline is a roll and move game that represents the moving of the resources of a large corporation around the world. Players compete to get to the end of the board first...<br/><br/>However, unlike a simple roll and move game, there are some interesting wrinkles. Each player uses a different mode of transport: airplane, train, truck, or boat. Each mode allows a player to avoid a hazard or gain an advantage in a particular situation that may or may not come up during any particular session. At the beginning of the game, the player who rolls highest gets to choose their mode of transport, followed by the next highest rolling player, etc. Each mode uses a different color pawn.<br/><br/>Also, players have the option of rolling for one of 5 special attributes at the beginning of the game. These attributes - 1. invoice, 2. letter of credit, 3. customs documents, 4. freight insurance, &amp; 5. the goods... are not exclusive to any one player and are randomly determined. A player may roll as many times as they like for these attributes (which can potentially prevent setbacks or lend an advantage), but once they've started moving on the board, they are not allowed to roll for any more attributes. Players must balance a desire for having as many attributes as possible with the notion of getting moving on the board.<br/><br/>The main path on the board (also the shortest path) is the Greenline of the title. However, if players land on certain squares they must roll a die to see if they are diverted onto a red circuit. This creates a delay as the player must go through a side path that usually has other negative encounter possibilities. There are also a number of yellow spaces on the board that represent random challenges which require the player to have one of the special attributes to avoid a penalty or to gain an advantage.<br/><br/>This game appears to have been developed by Philips to build teamwork or to encourage employees to think in terms of working as efficiently as possible. Apparently this game only appeared in Dutch.<br/><br/>",

Along the way the players must answer questions and can save for a bigger ship or a permit. <br/>  <br/>But that's not without a struggle. Players can encounter, severe turbulence, a license check by the water police, vehicle breakdown or they have to wait for an open bridge. After the purchase of a ship, all ports can be visited by water. The ports can also be visited overland, but that is dangerous because other players can tag you  on the ring dike. <br/>  <br/>The player who first collects all the port tokens, wins the game<br/><br/>Explanation for non-Dutch visitors<br/>In the Netherlands you must have a Sail License (Dutch: Vaarbewijs) if you want to sail a sailboat longer than 15 meter or a motorboat whose speed can exceed 20 km/h. <br/>There are two types of license.<br/>With Sail License 1 you may sail the numerous rivers, canals and small lakes of the Netherlands<br/>With Sail License 2 you may sail the big lakes, sea arms and inland seas.<br/>To get such a license you have to take an official exam, which quizzes you on traffic rules, navigation, boat handling  and the dangers  on the water.

Players attempt to outperform their opponent by playing enhancements to increase the power of the attack, evolve to a more potent form, or to even change the colour type to one more advantageous. Cards may also be played to weaken or devolve the opponent monsters.<br/>The monster ending the battle with the highest rating wins.<br/><br/>Each starter contains 34 cards and one gold embossed card and one special &quot;hologram&quot; card. Rules and battlemat are combined in a single mapfold sheet.<br/><br/>The Upper Deck release of the Digimon game in 2000 appears to use slightly modified cards as this with similar rules.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Chess in the Twilight Zone. From the introduction:<br/><br/>&quot;This game consists of two parallel planes of existence. On one plane we have a typical chessboard; on the other plane (Dimension X) we have a board inhabited by strange trans-dimensional chess pieces in the form of snakes, spiders and crabs.  These creatures can leave Dimension X, and also return<br/>to it...&quot;<br/><br/>The rules of the game are simple. The goal is to checkmate your opponent's king. You start with 2 chess boards next to each other. On one board, you play a normal chess game, making 1 move per turn. On the other board each player has 3 short range pieces - creatures with strange powers - that may only move in Dimension X and only attack in our dimension. Each player, during his or her turn, also either moves one of the Dimension X creatures on the second board, crosses between dimensions, or attacks with a creature in our dimension.<br/><br/>This is a most unusual 3D chess variant that quite literally adds a whole other level of tactics and strategy to chess, with a twist.<br/><br/>",

And in keeping with your luck, your ship encountered a mysterious space storm and crashed!<br/><br/>Sneakius IV is crammed full of every kind of lethal predator and deadly parasite that you could imagine... and you'll have to use your imagination because no survey team has ever survived the onslaught of ravenous beasties to file a report.  Your only hope is to try to make it across unknown terrain past horrible monsters to an escape shuttle at the abandoned ecology survey station.  But if you're caught on the way, you'll end up as lunch.  So, tread carefully Space Ranger... and pray you don't taste too delicious.<br/><br/>Gameplay Abstract<br/><br/>Players take on the role of characters moving from a crash site location to an abandoned ecology station using point to point movement.  The first player to reach the ecology station is the winner.  As players move their pawns through locations, they must roll a die to avoid detection by alien monsters represented by tokens.  If detected, they must fight.  Individual players use characters with individual strengths and weaknesses and player powers, helping them avoid or defeat monsters.  Each round, events on cards cause more monsters to spawn and regulate monster movement around the game board.<br/><br/>Additional Information<br/><br/>This game is an entry to the contest Sneaky Sci Fi Game Design Contest.<br/><br/>",

There are 63 spaces, which depict kings and emperors of France from the year 420 to 1859, and eagles. In the middle is a larger picture of the 'Famille Imp&eacute;riale' (Emperor Napoleon III, emperor from 1852-1870, with wife and son). Title and Rules of the Game are in Dutch, the text with the pictures is in French. In the four corners there are pictures of acts of war with the subscripts 'En Afrique'; 'En Crim&eacute;e'; 'En Italie'; 'En Chine.<br/><br/>Rule of the game<br/><br/>This game is played with two dice and goes from 1 to 63. Everyone throws [the dice] in turn, and puts something on the place that his number of pips indicates, with the second throw you move the number of spaces indicated by the number of pips in the throw, etc.<br/><br/>Whoever lands on number 63, the imperial family, wins the game and gets the pot. Before the start of the game, everyone agrees on an amount to put in the pot, and what the fines will be that have to be payed at every 'hinderpaal' (obstacle) or 'ontmoeting' (encounter) that either hinders progress or makes you change places, for example, if you throw 6, you pay a fine and go to 12.<br/>If you land on 19, you are resting in the hotel, you pay the fine that was predetermined and you have to pass for 1 turn.<br/>If you land on 31, where St.Louis is taken prisoner of war, you pay the fine and have to stay in the space until someone else is taken in your place.<br/>If you land on 42, you are in the imperial garden, you pay the fine and go back to 39 (it may say 30, I can't tell).<br/>If you land on 52, where the iron mask is in prison, you have to pay [the fine] and stay there until you are released again.<br/>If you land on 58, Napoleon II at Solferino, you have to pay [the fine] and start from the beginning (written is '= 24 june 1859').<br/>Whoever is passed by another player, has to pay and go to that players number.<br/>Whoever throws a 6 and 3 at the start of the game, goes to 26 the trophee, and whoever throws 5 and 4, goes to 53, the crown (not sure if I see the numbers right).<br/><br/>If you land on an eagle, you go forward again the number of pips you threw on the dice (this will happen again if you land on another eagle). If you would pass 63 this way, you count back so many spaces as you have movement left over.<br/><br/>",

Special deck cuts are used to determine kick-offs, kick returns, punts, field goals and extra point attempts. The players play a hand of Cribbage. The difference between the hand scores is the total net yardage gained or lost by the offensive player. The football peg is then moved the appropriate distance on the field.

The Technoids, as suggested by their name, use technology, while the Warlocks use magic.<br/><br/>The basic system is not especially complicated but there is a fair amount of chrome. For example, the Warlock player receives magic points which can be used to build new units and create effects (such as moving a star system). The Technoid player can't create new units but can scavenge the wrecks of old ones.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, the Warlock player chooses an alien race to play (some of which have special powers) and chooses a home system and colonies, along with a decoy race; all of this information is kept secret. The object of the game for the Technoid player is to find and destroy the Warlocks' systems.<br/><br/>This game should not be confused with Warriors of the Dark Star: The Age of the Neutron Wars.<br/><br/>",

DragonElves depicts the battle between the armies of the DragonElves and the BronzeMen.Players arrange their armies in 4 columns and striving to eliminate the units in the enemy ranks by direct combat and boosting attacks by playing various effect cards over a 4-Phase skirmish turn. Players attempt to better their opponents attacks with spells and skills, then augmented by a random draw.<br/><br/>As characters are eliminated then new warriors are exposed to attack until one side or the other has been totally wiped out.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rule book:<br/><br/>This is a gambling game for people who like to think and make decisions, or who like to discover how other people think and make decisions. The objective of the game is to acquire a greater dollar value of poker chips than any of the other Players. The game ends when either 1) the Bank is broken, or 2) an agreed upon time limit expires.<br/><br/>There are 3 different Versions of Critical Decisions:<br/><br/>A) The first, Version A, can be played by 2 or more people. It relies on extensive consumer research, and gives Players a good idea of how specific groups of Americans react to Critical Decisions. This is the informational Version of the game.<br/><br/>B)The second Version, Version B, can also be played by 2 or more Players. It asks particular players how they would react to Critical Decisions. It provides a friendly opportunity to explore the philosophies of your friends and acquaintances. This Version is played best with people who already know each other, or who want to know each other better. It's the personal Version of the game.<br/><br/>C) The third Version, Version C, is complicated analysis of group reactions. It should only be played by odd numbers of people. For those seeking just a little relaxation and interaction, it's a headache. For the hardcore cerebral types, it presents an unusual challenge.<br/><br/>",

They were here when our mighty forces came, this planet that was ours by right. They fought us till they were no more, ground to dust by our stark fists of destiny. We remember though, we remember them by playing this simple game. We remember how cheaply they sold their last moments, how easily they were led to the slaughter with mere promises. We remember the last of them, the very last, for that was our promise....that the last sneak standing would find a place in our history. So now remember...&quot;<br/><br/>The Battle Of The Stark Fist on July 5th  was brutal, short and final. What remained of Humanity was marched off to a barren expanse of wreckage known as Camp Apocalypse.  As the leader of one of the last remaining factions your goal is to keep your people alive as long as you can how ever you can in hope that something or someone might come along to save you from total destruction.<br/><br/>Your first job is to secure your followers a place to survive. With limited space you plot and plan with the other faction leaders to carve out your new home.<br/><br/>Your next job is to survive each day. The one certainty is that  when the sun sets another part of Camp Apocalypse will be destroyed by the malevolent Stark Fist. In the morning will need to bargain with what resources you have, including the lives your your followers, to find out what part of the Camp is going to be destroyed. The afternoon is spent moving your followers around the Camp to avoid the coming nights destruction, hopefully with the knowledge of  where the destruction is going to happen. After the bombs fall you will need to spend the evening hours caring for those who survived. If you can not supply them with food and shelter they will perish in the harsh night.<br/><br/>Each day goes as the one before and and your goal becomes ever more important...to have your faction be the last of Humanity.<br/><br/>Game Flow<br/>-Setup Up Phase- Camp Apocalypse<br/>-Main Phase - It Was The Best Of Times It Was The Last Of Times<br/>--- 1.

You will never know the pleasure of walking in the surf during a lazy summer vacation, bug. I'm so sorry for that. <br/><br/>In the midst of the panic over the moon they appeared. We tried to fight back but they destroyed our biggest weapons in their silos. Governments and world leaders responded in different ways. Some gave up instantly, and others resisted. The beach, bug, remember what I told you about that? It used to be a lot farther away, but that was before they made an example of it. All in all, it was a hell of a way to find out that we were not alone.<br/><br/>That was about 15 years ago. Since then, we've had some victories, but far too many failures. The biggest op your daddy was involved in was faking the crash on Mars a few years back. See, bug, we WANTED that ship to take heavy fire and crash, right where it did. There were enough diggers aboard to set up the underground Mars base. Last time daddy was there he got to see a new weapon, based on their tech. Hopefully we can have it ready soon.<br/><br/>This is why I have to go, bug. Mars needs people like me to sneak in, hide in the Moon belt, deliver supplies and workers, and get back home without being seen. And I promise you that one day I will take you to see the rings of Saturn, when we can fly throughout the system safely and freely. It'll be just you and me. I should be back soon. I will miss my little bug, bunches and bunches! Daddy will always l-<br/><br/>END TRANSMISSION<br/><br/>In SNEAK, players take on the role of heroic smugglers looking to transport supplies up to the secret Resistance base on Mars.  On each turn, you will have an amount of energy (action points) that you can use to maneuver and move your ship around the board.  However, any leftover energy is converted in cargo cards, that you draw into hand.  Asteroids will then semi-randomly move around the board, blocking your way or revealing your hiding space.  Then, the aliens will move and attempt to destroy you.  Each time you get hit by an alien you will have to lose cargo cards- or else you will have to start your smuggling run again.  Upon a successful run, you will score notoriety points based on the cargo you brought and can spend it to increase your maximum energy, maximum cargo (hand size), and number of special powers (mods), or to buy new mods.<br/>The most notorious smuggler at the end of 10 rounds is the winner!<br/><br/>",

Psephology uses compilations of precinct voting returns for elections going back some years, public opinion polls, campaign finance information and similar statistical data. The term was coined in the United Kingdom in 1952 by historian R. B. McCallum to describe the scientific analysis of past elections. In Britain the term occasionally appears in scholarly literature.<br/><br/>The game has 625 cards containing 2500 questions and answers, Power Politics cards, game pieces, dice, a game board and vote cards.<br/><br/>Roll the dice, decide how to move your marker, read the vote bonus/penalty on the board and then attempt to correctly answer a political question to win votes.<br/><br/>Includes rules for 7-12 players and classroom team play, including a timed version.<br/><br/>",

It consisted of six pages of rules, three pages of OOB and playtest response form, two pages of counters (which needed to be colored, mounted, and cut out), and seven pages of maps (which needed to be cut out and assembled).<br/><br/>The rules seem typical for a simple wargame from this period, with a few embellishments such as rules for canal-building, mines, and mortars. The most unusual element of the game is that it takes place on two maps, a small map for campaign operations and a large map showing just the fortifications around Vicksburg. Units are presumably supposed to move between the two, but the rules are not entirely clear.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Zhang Qi is an abstract strategy game, in which the players simply take turns claiming a number from the set {2, 5, 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 20, 23, 25, 31, 33, 37, 39, 40, 44, 46, 49, 50, 53, 59, 60, 61, 62, 68, 71, 73, 74, 78, 79, 83}.  What makes the game something other than a trivial exercise is that the person whose turn it is, is always the player with the lower score, which means that getting too far ahead can ultimately set you behind, as your opponent takes several turns in a row. The winner is the player whose claimed numbers have the highest sum.<br/><br/>Because the shape of the board is irrelevant (technically, you could play by grabbing numbered chips from the middle of the table), the designer gave the game some visual appeal by making the board square, with numbered spaces set up like the board was broken into fragments.<br/><br/>",

On your turn place a piece on your board in any row as far left as available. All other players immediately place a piece on their own board in the same place. When all 8 pieces are played the puzzle solving begins.<br/><br/>Solving the Puzzle and Scoring Points: Pieces may be moved left and right, but not up or down. The very last column on the right (I) is reserved for the cube. Once a player has all of their pieces in different columns from A-H, simultaniously on different colors and are the first to grab the cube and place it onto the missing color they score a point.<br/><br/>Negative Points: Players who grab the cube before finishing the puzzle get a negative point. Players can also get a negative point by grabbing the cube and finding that their answer is actually not correct.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a card game for 7 players. It is based around Space Pirates. Though similar to BANG!, there are several unique twists. Each player has his own unique objective, and his own unique card set based on his own unique alien race. Each player commands a ship that has 15 Hit Points. Hits are usually taken using Dice. However, while some players may have powerful attacks, the focus of the game for many players is not to destroy the other players but to accomplish an objective.<br/><br/>Samples:<br/>Akzinal - A traditional thief. His goal is to capture all treasures.<br/>Felian - A snakelike race, the Felian are tremendously territorial. Their objective is to be the last Faction standing.<br/>Homin - This hominid race lived relatively peacefully until an alien race sent an explosive that destroyed many lives, not including the lives that were lost. The Homin Captain seeks to find and neutralize the alien menace.<br/>Morph - As their name suggests, the Morph are a race of appearance-altering people who have developed their ships to transform as well. Always seeking to attain transcendence, the Morph try to do so by learning from other people. Their objective is to acquire technologies from all other factions.<br/>Ralyk - Wolf Men. Because their genetics prevent their reproduction, the only way they can continue as a race is to (naturally) turn others into Wolf Men. They prominently seek out the Alphas of each species. This said, their objective is to capture all opposing Captains through duel or by kidnapping.<br/>Var*por - A squidlike race who travel aboard live ships. These ships look like rays but hold solar powers. Thus they are called StarRay in first phase and SunRay in later phase. The objective is to raise a StarRay to its second phase and lead it to a New Birth phase where another StarRay is born.<br/>Wallaboo - A small teleporting Kangaroo race who stow away on ships and influence the playing field. They maneuver game play while attempting to remain unnoticed and escape capture. Their objective is to be free aboard the winning ship.<br/><br/>Objectives that are well thought out with interesting back-story, only made more incredible by the fact that this game is so easy to play.<br/><br/>As stated, each faction has their own unique abilities, but a shared deck unites them all. In this shared deck are Detonator Cards (the central card which allows players to make basic attacks or to play their faction cards), Evasion Tactics which protect ships from attack, Quick Fix cards to restore Hit Points, Steal cards that allow players to steal Faction abilities from other factions (including Captains and Treasures), Void cards which return continuous abilities to their decks, and other (more unique) abilities.<br/><br/>Dueling, a major factor of Traditional Bang, is now done exclusively in battle for captains. (All players may Duel for opposing captains, as Captain cards hold unique abilities. This was also true of Traditional Bang). This does not require the use of cards. Any player can Duel with an opponent that has less than 1/2 Hit Points. Each Captain has his own HP rating, and a series of D6 Dice Rolls resolves a Duel. The winner retains the opponent's captain along with his unique ability.<br/><br/>Another new feature of Shores of Heaven is a mini game called Common Threat, wherein 2 D6's are rolled and the values are multiplied. Players must work together to destroy the Common Threat before returning to play. Each player who fails to neutralize the threat loses 1 HP. The Victor redeems all lost HP.<br/><br/>FOLLOWING IS A SIMPLE RULE SET. SOON, WITH PRINTABLE CARDS TO BE UPLOADED, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLAY THE GAME WITHIN A FEW MINUTES...<br/><br/>START <br/>Along with cards, you will need a D4 and a D6 to play. (Unique sided dice are usually inexpensive and can be found on the internet or at specialty board game shops.)<br/>After Starting Position has been determined, each player pulls a faction at random from the SPECIES deck. This card remains face up until the faction is removed from play. There are two SPECIES decks, only one of which has a WALLABOO card. If the WALLABOO card is chosen, the Wallaboo faction keeps the additional SPECIES deck to mark his current position. His position is revealed to only the player who plays the IMPRISONMENT card. (Each faction has an IMPRISONMENT card in his FACTION deck.) If the Wallaboo plays his TRUCE card, his position is then revealed to all players.<br/>At this point, all players but the Homin also receive a THREAT card, distinguishing them as a Menace or as Benign.<br/>OBJECTIVES:<br/>Akz&iacute;nal - Acquire all treasures. This can be done using a STEAL card from the SHARED deck or a FILCH card from your personal deck. The treasure is returned to your opponent if 1) It is VOIDED. 2) It is STOLEN. 3) It is taken back using 2 DETONATOR cards. 4) You are destroyed. (It is reshuffled into the FACTION deck.)<br/>Felian - Be the last Faction standing. Your Treasure card can help, as it allows you to regenerate after 1 round destroyed. This card stays in effect until it is stolen or voided.<br/>Homin - Hunt and neutralize the Menace. THREAT cards distributed at the start of play determine the Menace. If the Menace is destroyed by someone else, THREAT cards are redistributed. You must destroy the Menace yourself.<br/>Morph - Steal and hold Faction cards from each opponent. These are considered learned abilities, and may be made Lasting Effects, regardless of status, as long as your treasure is in play. (See CARD SYMBOLS for details.) Addendum: Wallaboo movement cards effect range. Sabotage card (in Wallaboo deck) counts against your HP, and is returned to the Wallaboo deck as soon as acquired.<br/>Ralyk - Acquire all Captains. This can be done using a Steal card, or by Dueling. (See CAPTAIN DUEL for details.) If an opponent&rsquo;s ship is destroyed, his captain is left out, and a Steal card can acquire the Captain for you. <br/>V&auml;r&middot;por - Raise your StarRay to New Birth phase. See SunRay gauge. (This is a narrow purple sheet marked with 15 movements and contains pictures of SunRays at all phases.)<br/>Wallaboo - Remain free aboard the winning faction&rsquo;s ship. If imprisoned (See Imprisonment cards), you cannot play any of your cards. You can, however, discard and collect cards each round until you hold the Escape card. (Since it has a cost of 2 Detonator cards, you will want those in your hand when you find it.)<br/>CARDS You will start with 2 FACTION cards and 5 SHARED DECK cards. This is the maximum number of cards you will hold in your hand. However, both at the start and end of your turn you will be able to replenish your hand. (Thus Attack does not penalyze Defense.) You may only discard unwanted cards at the end of your turn, before replenishing your hand. <br/>Cards of the same type may be stacked to boost effect. I.E. Because of this, a player who has 2 FOCUS cards may be able to roll a maximum value of 8 with a D4.<br/>CARD SYMBOLS Each card likely has 1 or both of 2 symbols. The first is LE (Lasting Effect). The card may be played down to be in permanent use. The second is #D. This indicates how many Detonator cards must be played to use the card. If the LE has a #D over it, this indicates that there is a cost to make the card a lasting effect. If the card has LE and #D on opposite cards, it may be played as a Lasting Effect but you must play as many Detonator cards for each use.<br/>CAPTAINS&rsquo; DUEL - Each Captain Card has a number in the upper right corner. This is how many hits a captain may take before he is defeated. Each time a Duel takes place, both captains start with full HP. Both captains roll a D6. When one opponent rolls higher, the opposite loses 1 HP. This is repeated until 1 captain is lost. Captains may only back out of a Captains&rsquo; Duel if a truce is agreed upon. The winner keeps the opponent&rsquo;s captain as prisoner and can use the additional Captain&rsquo;s ability freely. If you lose your Captain, you can only rescue the captain using a Steal card, or a Void card. Any captain can duel with an opponent&rsquo;s captain so long as the challenged opponent has less than &frac12; HP. <br/>VOID - This card usually means the opponent forfeit&rsquo;s a card of his choice. However, if you play a VOID card with a DETONATOR card, you may roll a D4. Rolling a 4 or higher (using bonus cards) can give you the ability to choose which Lasting Effects are voided. This can prove a useful tool in recollecting Captains and Treasures as the VOID card returns cards to their Faction decks.<br/>COMMON THREAT - When this card is found, it is played immediately. Roll 2 D6&rsquo;s, and multiply the scores. Each player in succession uses their attack cards to destroy the common threat. If the player fails to destroy the threat, he loses 1 HP. This continues until the threat is destroyed. The Victor receives all lost HP. The player of this card may determine the initial opponent after the dice roll. (This means that some clever calculation can result in a quick HP boost for him.)<br/>RANGE  - Unless otherwise stated, all attacks have a range of 1 in either direction. Captains&rsquo; Duel is maximum range. <br/>TREASURES - All opponents may steal treasures to use opponents&rsquo; treasure abilities.<br/><br/>",

Cards depict holiday events like last minute shopping and package in the mail.  Each one instruct the players to pass cheer right or left, take some from the center.  Players can choose to keep rolling the die, hoping to get more cheer, but some rolls can make them lose it all.  Everyone has fun because it&rsquo;s impossible to know who will be holding the most cheer when the game ends.<br/><br/>It&rsquo;s for 3 to 6 players.  There is text to read on the cards, but as long as one player at the table can read even young children can easily enjoy the game.  It takes only about 10 minutes to play.<br/><br/>The game comes with:<br/>- a wooden hand-painted gingerbread man pawn (each is unique) <br/>- a 1&quot; die (green or red) <br/>- 10 color cards <br/>- 60 plastic chips <br/>- 1 rule sheet (not in the picture)<br/><br/>Besides just enjoying the game with family and friends, rules are included to use it to give out gifts at a party or family get-together during the holidays.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "1) What is Sector?<br/>Sector is a board game, for 2 to 4 players. The game is based on the strategic occupation of the game board. Taking turns, the participants role a normal cube die and place pieces on the board, according to preset rules. Some of the pieces, or some of the squares where the pieces can be placed, have specific properties that affect how that particular turn is played. Players who can't, in their turn, place the required pieces on the squares of the board are eliminated. The winner is the last surviving player.<br/><br/>2) What do I need to play Sector?<br/>(a) A game board (15x15 squares), with special squares marked;<br/>(b) 225 normal pieces and 20 special pieces (per 2 players);<br/>(c) Nontransparent bag(s) or box(es) for the pieces;<br/>(d) One cube (1-6) die.<br/><br/>3) Let's start the game. Who plays first?<br/>Let the players throw the die and the person with the highest number goes first. After that, the turn proceeds clockwise.<br/><br/>4) What does each turn consist of?<br/>(a) Roll the die.<br/>(b) Take the number of pieces corresponding to the value obtained in that particular throw from the nontransparent bag and place the pieces, in a straight line, on the board. If you happen to draw a special piece or the last piece happens to end in a special square, certain other rules apply.<br/><br/>5) It's my first turn. I've rolled the die. Where should I begin?<br/>In the first turn, all players start in any chosen square, on the edge of the board.<br/><br/>6) How can I place my pieces?<br/>The pieces, always corresponding to the number obtained with the throw of the die, must be placed in a straight line. You are not allowed to turn in a different direction nor are you allowed to place one piece over another. The line, except obviously in the first turn, must always start from a preexisting piece belonging to the current player.<br/><br/>7) What are special squares?<br/>Special squares are clearly marked squares on the board that have a unique propertie. When a line, in a turn, ends on a special square, the current player can place, if possible, an extra piece on any other free special square in the board. This only happens when the turn ends on a special square, not when it crosses a special square. The extra piece is only taken from the nontransparent bag when all other pieces are in place.<br/><br/>8) And special pieces? What are they?<br/>Special pieces are distinctly marked pieces that allow the player to convert, if possible, adjacent opponent pieces into his own. They are mixed up with the normal pieces in the nontransparent bag and are taken, eventually, by chance, when the player is taking the number of pieces obtained by the role of the die or taking a piece for a special square as described above. Special pieces can be used at any point of the line and in any direction as chosen by the current player. The drawing in the special piece shows the allowed positions from which the opponent&acute;s piece(s) can be converted into a player&acute;s piece. In the drawing, on the piece, a dark circle represents the player special piece and the light circles represent the the allowed conversion positions.<br/><br/>Description from the author.<br/><br/>",

It was given away at EMT&Eacute; Supermarkets (The Netherlands) for the 2010 World Cup.<br/><br/>The game recuires 1 die and a miniature from 'Het Oranje Legioen' per player. 'Het Oranje Legioen' are small, orange supporters you can collect at the supermarket.<br/><br/>The board is a soccerpitch on which players move their pawn. On different fields a special situation happens - always with a soccer background: a yellow card, an off-side, free kick, etc. The winner is the one who - on the last field - kicks the ball in the right corner (by throwing the die).<br/><br/>",

Far from being a childish game, the tournaments he arranges provide a challenge for memory, tactics and intuition. Will you be able to set clever traps for your opponents while avoiding to get caught in theirs... or even yours?<br/>MATERIAL: AN 8x8 board, 48 tiles and 4 counters in different colors.<br/>TRAMPOLINES (TILES):Charlie&acute;s trampolines do not allow to jump the way the user pleases, but only in certain directions (according to the arrows inscribed in the tiles) which are revealed just when they are trodden on. The arrows are in three colours: green (1-space jump), orange (2-spaces jump) and red (3-spaces jump). Besides, there are two types of arrows: one-way (self explanatory) and multidirectional (the user may choose among two o three possibilities). Finally, there also exist two &lsquo;fake&rsquo; trampolines that once occupied will tumble down and will make the player lose its counter.<br/>GOAL:  To be the last player remaining on the board, the rest having fallen in a hole or being forced to jump out of the trampolines field.<br/><br/>",

You&rsquo;d better get going!<br/><br/>God Calling: Build an Ark is an irreverent game that combines the biblical story of Noah and the Great Deluge and the timeless tradition of crank calls.  Be the first to gather your Animals, Wood, and Nails, but be warned, everyone else wants the same, and competition is fierce!<br/><br/>Each turn, players play Supply cards, trying to fulfill the minimum requirements for their ark: three Wood cards, three Nail cards, and three Animal cards.  However, everyone also has God Calling cards that aid or hinder the players, making them require more cards to complete their ark, discard cards, or counter other God Calling cards.  Play is fast and frantic, as players play their cards as fast as they can.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the publisher's website:<br/><br/>American Throttle, The Game is in a few words, a &ldquo;Poker Run&rdquo; that tours the United States. It&rsquo;s about having some drinks, some fun and some laughs. Share stories of rallies you&rsquo;ve been to like Laughlin, Sturgis or Daytona. Belch a name, take a swig of your drink, tell a joke, name that song, guess who was in that biker movie, or even give unwanted advice! Test your knowledge of motorcycling, motorcycle trivia, and road skills. You can even invite your family or friends who don&rsquo;t ride, since they can play to win too! They will learn a lot about riding either from you or this game!<br/><br/>There are two ways to win: finish first to win half the game, draw the best poker hand to win the other half of the game. It&rsquo;s smarts and luck. This is a drinking game, so it is geared toward adults. However if you forego the alcohol and let young adults in on the fun, American Throttle is actually a general audience, sometimes educational, definitely fun game for them too. In other words, we didn&rsquo;t put in a bunch of junk. This is about riding!<br/><br/>Here is how it is played: Up to seven players or teams of players per game. Put money (or anything you would like) in the Pot. Pick one of 15 motorcycle playing pieces &amp; take your first poker card. Start in the upper northwest and roll the die to tour the country. Pick another poker card at each rally you visit. The person to reach the end, or Hollister Rally first wins half the Pot. The person with the best poker hand wins the other half of the Pot. So, anyone can win! Oh yeah and it makes a great Christmas gift for the biker, the game player, or the person who has everything (because they probably don&rsquo;t have one of these).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Bomb! is a board game designed by a primary 4 student, Tan Zhiyong, from Rosyth School in Singapore.<br/><br/>The game appears to be similar to snakes and ladders, each player has a single pawn that moves up a boustrophedon track, and there are ladders that pawns can climb up and bombs which send pawns back to the start.  There are also a few squares with instructions like &quot;miss a turn&quot; and &quot;Move forward 3 spaces&quot;. All other squares that do not have a bomb or instructions on them have a fraction. Whenever a player lands on a fraction, they add it to their own cumulative score. The aim of the game is not to be the first to reach the last square, but to have the highest total sum of fractions among all players once everyone has reached the last square.<br/><br/>The game is copyright of Government of Singapore and the graphic design is copyright of Noble Education.com (indicated on the board)<br/><br/>The game does not come in a box, but in a large transparent sleeve which holds the laminated cardboard board and bits.<br/><br/>",

The pieces are numbered from one to seven and that number represents their movement capability.  Each player takes alternating two-stage turns in which they move pieces and may switch positions of pieces if desired.  The first player on the first turn may move only; no switching.  The goal is to capture two pairs of opposing pieces.  It is possible to win with just four captures, or to lose even after making eight captures.  It is being released in 2010 as a print-and-play playtest version.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Publisher blurb<br/><br/>At the end of the Cold War historians declared an &ldquo;end to history.&rdquo; Supposedly there was nothing left to fight about and a period of prolonged peace and prosperity seemed at hand. Sadly this was not to be. The events of September 11th, 2001 proved there were still issues to fight over.<br/><br/>But as the War on Terror ended and the Obama administration transformed America, abdicating its role as sole world peacekeeper, other nations reignited the great power struggle ended in World War II by division of the planet into two blocs.<br/><br/>Ironically, the environmentalist dogma of declining world resources was the catalyst that launched a new struggle between the world powers; a struggle not for power or prestige, but to control access to the resources that everyone was assured would soon be rapidly depleted. The New World Order is dead. Long live the New World Disorder!<br/><br/>Fast playing and easy to learn, World War IV is a two to eight player game played on a tabletop where players are leaders of major powers in a struggle for world resources. Conquer earthly resources or pursue a space program to develop off-world colonies and resources.<br/><br/>The game system emphasizes strategy and places a minimum on die rolling. Rules include weapons of mass destruction, missile defense, cyber warfare, air, ground, and space combat.<br/><br/>Each major power has its own special rules and pieces including Texas militia, Falun Gong chi-knights, Russian Spetznaz, European robotic panzers, American mobile infantry, South American guerillas, Turkish mujahideen, Japanese armed spacecraft and more!<br/>The game includes eleven sheets of die-cut game pieces and complete rules. Some six-sided dice (not included) are required to play.<br/><br/>",

Each player takes a set of four coloured chips with stickers depicting children of different races and places them on the starting positions at four corners of the island. The object of the game is to move these pieces one step at a time to link them up in a diamond shape or in a straight line. Along the way, there are spaces marked with a star that act as barriers. If a player's piece lands on one of these starred spaces, an opponent takes a card from a stack of cards bearing questions about ethnic customs, festivals or practices in Singapore and asks the player the question. If the player answers correctly, the piece is allowed to remain on the starred space, otherwise it must return to the space it had just moved from.<br/><br/>The game was first printed in 1992.

The game was planned and produced by the National Community Organisations Council.The game was made and printed in Singapore by Promtion &amp; Sales Centre Pte Ltd.<br/><br/>",

You manage a team of warriors (up to four) that you build up, equip and unleash on your opponent. The game is played on a hex-based arena, with stand-up cardboard figures representing the fighters.<br/><br/>Your fighters are from one of five races, each with statistics that determine their strength in combat, and special skills. Character creation is a large part of the game and is similar to a simple RPG system.<br/><br/>Combat is similar to many miniature based systems. The turn phases are: (1) Initiative, which determines how many actions you get per turn; (2) Movement, using movement points; (3) Actions &amp; Attacks, when you can perform the number of actions allowed by your initiative roll; and (4) Tests and Withdrawals, when you check to see if your fighter can shrug off his wounds, random events and when you can withdraw a fighter from the contest.<br/><br/>There are also rules for spell casting, special arenas and managing a gladiatorial team through a campaign.<br/><br/>Contents are: A rule book, arena map, terrain overlay sheet, two sheets of stand up figures and a bag of plastic stands for the figures.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Manual Prologue:<br/><br/>The Story So Far...<br/><br/>Shortly after the discovery of faster&minus;than&minus;light travel, humanity reached for the stars and expanded beyond its home solar system to colonize planets throughout the Milky Way galaxy. Hundreds of planets have been inhabited, with the species seeing unprecedented growth and prosperity, all ruled autonomously and under the protection of the Free Alliance of Stars. Man had believed, after almost limitless exploration and colonization, that mankind was unique, and that no other intelligent life of any kind existed outside of human&minus;controlled planets. Then, the Continuum attacked the Sirius system. Human defense forces did not believe there to be a threat in the universe, and were woefully unprepared for the invasion, with nearly every man, woman, and child murdered by the alien menace.<br/><br/>Three weeks after the last message was received on Earth, the human fleet dispatched from Jupiter Base reached the Sirius system only to find that every colonized planet had been bombarded from orbit, utterly devastating the colonial surfaces. No sign was left of life, human or otherwise, until a small lifeboat was recovered in space with a dying scientist, Dr. Mark Wallace, who chronicled the assault on the colonies shortly before his death. Humans were not alone in the universe, and they were being systematically eradicated.<br/><br/>30 years later, the war was being waged in every corner of the galaxy, and Humanity had taken advantage of its genetic predisposition of reason and their inherent ability to quickly learn and adapt. They first learned the name of the enemy via decoding communications taken during battles, and later reverse&minus;engineered power sources, propulsion systems, and most importantly, the highly advanced weapons systems that the enemy had used against them. Humanity now had a hope of repelling the invaders, and would stop at nothing until the Continuum was stopped.<br/><br/>The Continuum is a collective of enslaved worlds, made up of several hundred species native to planets outside of our galaxy, all burning with the sole desire to subjugate all habitable planets and species, or destroy them if they were deemed a threat. The only chance that humanity has to stop them is to travel to the Continuum Homeworld, located somewhere in the Crab Nebula, and to destroy their leadership and command and control structure, defeating the threat forever.<br/><br/>Epic Engagements is a stand-alone tactical starship combat game that can use included components as well as models from Star Wars Miniatures: Starship Battles or any other models. Players begin on opposite ends of a 24x36&quot; Star Map and using a turn-based &quot;simultaneous action&quot; mechanic wage war on one another using capital ships such as carriers, frigates and fighters to defeat the enemy force.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "DISAMBIGUATION:  This design is 25 years old.  It is NOT the game designed by Joel Chacon for GMT Games.  For information on that game, please refer to UNPUBLISHED PROTOTYPE.<br/><br/>Scramble for Africa recreates the European exploration and partition of Africa in the final decades of the nineteenth century, combining a strong historical theme and the random element of discovery with a simple positional game system. Played on an authentic 19th-century map of Africa, Scramble for Africa includes two scenarios, one historical and one hypothetical, each playable in under two hours. Complexity is easy (about 2/10).<br/><br/>Play is determined by the triangular grid, which is superimposed over a map of Africa.  The points at which the lines of the grid intersect determine the placement of pieces on the game board in a manner similar to the game of go.  A player action consists of placing one control marker on the map, often in conjunction with moving an army (if in play), playing an event chit, and/or drawing an event chit from the randomizer cup. Event chits add random elements to the game, and include discoveries, diplomatic events, resources, or encounters with native populations. The object of the game is to acquire the most Victory Points, primarily by surrounding and controlling spaces in a manner similar to the game of go.  At the end of the game, players receive Victory Points for their positions on the board, and for resources controlled.  This is added to VP's accumulated for discoveries accumulated during the course of the game.  The player with the greatest score, obviously, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

You build ships, research technology, and expand your empire through vast star systems, of which several may be used at once.<br/><br/>Players will build massive fleets of varying ships and fight for control of the planets they need to yield resources, and spread their culture across one or more star systems. All while attempting to destroy another players Home World. Once a Home World has fallen, the game ends, and scores are totaled using a score card. <br/>Scoring is the most detailed and elaborate part of the game. Players can earn points in all four different categories, including Military, Culture, Technology and Economy. There are also bonuses for players who scored the highest in any one of these areas.<br/><br/>            Sadly, the one who looses their Home World REALLY looses in points. Trying to work this problem out so they don't feel like they loose so badly, while keeping book keeping down to a bare minimum. Any suggestions on how to do this would be greatly appreciated. This is one of the main things I have yet to really work out.<br/>        <br/>    <br/><br/><br/>Features:<br/><br/>-- 3 unique races, each with special abilities, research trees, and &quot;Home World advantages&quot;.<br/>-- 3 different resources to manage, along with a black market, on which you can sell or buy these resources if you cannot acquire them through &quot;legal&quot; means.<br/>-- All planet types you can expect to find: Terran, Desert, Volcanic, Ice, Asteroids, Worm Holes... <br/>-- Several ship classes, including Frigates, Cruisers and Capital Ships.<br/>-- Bucket of Dice combat system makes the battles fast and easy, while still having the epic space battles that the PC game delivers.<br/>-- Semi-Modular game boards. The star-system boards are set up with blank spaces linked by phase lines to place planets. Set up a random map, or design your own. Each map also has 2 different colored Phase Lines for smaller or larger games.<br/>-- Pirates occupy each undiscovered planet, with the player opposite of you rolling for the Pirates. This allows for a bit more interaction in the beginning of the game.<br/>-- Cheap. Besides the dice, you only need to print out a few items. The only thing you really need to print with quality is the Star System board, and two 4x6 sheets of game counters.<br/><br/>Designer Note: I do not own any of the rights to the PC game, nor do I intend on making any sort of profit from it in the slightest.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Premise:<br/><br/>You are a group of nerds and/or geeks who have discovered a secret tomb of a long-gone fanatic of geek/nerddom.  Inside you discover a spiraling tower of RPG, video game, and movie stereotypes of every sort on each floor, and must collect treasures and artifacts  from each of them in order to challenge the Master Ghost and claim the title of Master Geek for yourself.<br/><br/>But meanwhile, a deranged, shadowy psychopathic killer stalks your strongest party member, believing that he would get your champion's powers if he kills him/her.  He's slow, but insanely powerful, and to meet him would mean almost certain doom.<br/><br/>Once someone challenges and defeats the Master Geek, the dungeon starts crumbling, but the psycho-killer still stalks you (unless you killed him before).<br/><br/>Goal<br/>The goal is to get the most prestige upon exiting the tower, getting prestige points for each treasure item collected, each artifact acquired, along with bonus points for the person who defeats the Master Geek and/or the psycho-killer.<br/><br/>Gameplay:<br/><br/>The players start outside of the tower, and walk inside to a lobby and a staircase leading upwards, where they may or may not encounter enemies.  These are all represented by cards.  The stairways/lobbies and tower corridors/rooms are represented by wider and larger cards, and each detail a special conditional effect that takes place with everyone who stays in the corridor/room/stairway/lobby, even if the conditional effect is &quot;this is just a normal room.&quot;  Some examples include rooms where battles are tougher in some way, rooms where each player's gender is changed, rooms where there's treasure lying everywhere, and a room where all the enemies are flying and thus are more difficult to fight.<br/><br/>The tower begins unexplored.  As players explore the tower, going up stairs and walking through the floors, a room/stairway/floor effect card is drawn and placed onto any unexplored space they walk into.  If a room is empty (void of monsters) upon entry, a new battle is triggered.<br/><br/>Battles are fought with a bit of luck combined with overall strength.  Each floor has a certain &quot;battle size&quot; (with certain rooms having increased battle sizes), which determine the number of monsters that can fight in any single battle.  Upon entering the previously mentioned empty room, players draw a number of encounter cards (which are smaller than the room cards) equal to the battle size of the floor/room they are on.  The encounter cards can include everything from the monsters themselves, to traps and curses that affect a character negatively, to positive boons, and any number of special training (which allows the characters to have a class analogous to the genre they are currently fighting in, or a DNA transformation that allows them to do something very similar with their &quot;race&quot; (includes standard fantasy races in floors 1-2, &quot;horror&quot; races like vampires and werewolves in floor 3, and so on...).  If a character draws the number of encounter cards required and ends up not having to fight a battle equal to the battle size of the room/floor, other players can add additional monsters to increase the battle up to the battle size.  Other players can also play cards to strengthen either side.  Multiple monsters add to each other's strengths, and special other cards allow players to add monsters beyond the maximum battle size.  Players can also negotiate another player's help if the other player is on the same floor.  Battles are fought by rolling a d12, and adding the result to each side's total strength.<br/><br/>If a monster is defeated, the player who is playing his turn may find a special floor artifact (each of which adds to a character's strength) if the monster was sufficiently powerful enough.  In order to enter the top floor, the players need a certain amount of artifacts from each floor below.  Monsters also drop loot, and players can pick up a certain amount of loot each turn.  Other players can also swerve in to raid a large loot pile.  Loot can include anything that could be considered treasure: equipment that add to character strength, free artifacts, temporary power-ups (like grenades and pixie dust), protection items, and items that are otherwise worthless but are value at high currency (totaled for points in the end).  If a player doesn't fight a battle in a room he's entered, he can draw additional encounter cards for future (or immediate) use.<br/><br/>Once a player has acquired a certain number of artifacts from each floor, he can enter the top floor, where the Master Geek resides.  Battles there are tougher than any other floor, and draw from the monsters that the players might have encountered previously on every other floor.  The players might also encounter the Master Geek himself, who's obviously a lot stronger than those tougher battles.  If a player manages to defeat him, the tower starts crumbling (one room/stairway is removed at the end of each player's turn), and the players' goal is to then escape the falling tower).<br/><br/>A twist is that there's an insanely powerful psycho-killer who's always stalking the strongest player (changing targets if that position is taken by another player).  He only moves 2 rooms per turn cycle (each player can always move 3), but if he catches you, it's very bad news.  It's very likely he'll kill the character <i>and</i> drain him of several artifacts (other monsters can kill you as well, but he's the one that'll probably have the easiest time doing it).  He's still stalking you once the tower starts crumbling, and very likely, he'll be standing between your characters and the exit.  If a player dies, they respawn at the entrance, but leave all their equipment and items as loot in the last room they were in (free for other players to raid, or to get lost in the crumbling of the tower at the end).<br/><br/>When all characters have exited the tower successfully after the defeat of the Master Geek, points are calculated, factoring in: 1) the amount of treasure/equipment a player has retained, 2) how many other players the player beat to the exit, 3) how many artifacts the player has acquired, 4) whether or not the player was the one to defeat the Master Geek, and 5) if the player defeated the Psycho.  Whoever is found to have the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>",

Changes made to the past propagate downstream the timeline, so victory can be pursued in the present through direct conflict or by manipulating history. Game is over when one player exerts influence over the entire present.<br/><br/>The board consists of five rows of pentagons that represent the same sites at five different points in time.  Players take three actions per round, which can include moving one space, move a minion one space, initiate an attack by minions on other players' minions, moving a minion from base to a device card (represents researching and devoting resources to developing the device) producing a minion in the current space, drawing a card, or playing a card. Alternatively, a traveler may spend all three actions to travel forward or backward in time to the same site in that era.<br/><br/>Cards include various attack and defense and minion production bonuses, devices to research and produce including bombs that destroy chunks of SpaceTime, with most of the damage propagating down the timeline, Isolator belts that allow you to convert minions into new travelers (giving you more pieces and actions to work with),  and various instant travel and event cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Published 1933<br/>Written by Sydney Thompson &amp; George V. Denny Jr.<br/>Published by Samuel French <br/>Format: small book<br/>Original price: 50 cents<br/><br/>From the introduction:<br/>&quot;The purpose of the game is to provide theatrical entertainment for clubs or drawing-rooms in which the audience shall take the part of witnesses of an event being enacted before them. After the performance the audience will be cross examined on what they have observed and will be asked to solve the mystery.&quot;<br/><br/>User summary:<br/>Detecto-Plays contains 6 short plays that are intended to be fleshed out by a small cast.  At the end the audience will be asked by the director ten questions.  Each question that is answered correctly is worth 10 points.  Wrong or incomplete answers are worth nothing.  Some of them are single scenes plays, some have as many as six scenes.<br/><br/>This appears to be a very early version of modern murder-mystery party games. It's unusual in that the scenarios and dialogs were written by two playwrights that were producing work for New York theatres at the time.<br/><br/>One of the scenarios also includes a game within the game as the actors play a game called &quot;murder&quot; which appears to be a popular  party game at the time, similar to &quot;Are you a werewolf?&quot;<br/><br/>",

The first release contains a story booklet describing exciting super hero action and adventure on the faraway planet of Cetus. You&rsquo;ll meet legends like Star Warrior and Thantos and evil villains like Krakan and Ghengis Khan!<br/><br/>Included with the story booklet are playing cards representing the heroes and villains of COTG in a super hero motif. You receive 6 cards, plus blank templates to create your own characters.<br/><br/>Part 2 of this Champions of the Galaxy story is scheduled for release in December and Part 3 (final part) in July 2011.<br/><br/>Cetus has been attacked by the military forces of General Krakan. How will the top military brass on Cetus respond? Players can use the provided story or develop their own plots as you set up battles of good and evil. Each character is represented by a card with different attacks and defensive moves. Similar to the original Champions of the Galaxy card game, you roll on one of three offensive levels trying to wear down your opponent. The opponent won't go down without a fight, so if they happen to roll a comeback defensive move, they take over on offense. The fight goes back and forth until one fighter is defeated. New to COTG is the idea of fighting more epic battles with multiple opponents. You can have Star Warrior take on a group of Sentry Bots where he must defeat all the enemies to win. If he loses, will Supernova take over to conquer evil. Its up you in Battle for Cetus since its your story.<br/><br/>",

The goal is to defeat enemy companies by moving miniatures around on a gaming area that represents a battlefield (a table is enough). Fighters&rsquo; actions (moving, attacking, and so on) are simulated with the use of a deck of cards. Victory is gained through a subtle mix of chance and cunning. Imagination and strategy are key here!<br/><br/>Aarklash Warpack is a game meant for two or more players ages twelve and over.<br/>A game lasts roughly 30 minutes (rules reading included).<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In the wake of the Great War, a new arms race loomed. The United States and Japan each trusted in a strong navy to achieve future security and retain political influence. Within three years of the Treaty of Versailles, no less than twenty-five new battleships and battlecruisers had been ordered by the two powers, exactly equal to the number already in commission at the end of the War.<br/><br/>The Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 was meant, among other things, to put an end to increased militarization in the Pacific; but by feeding into Japanese resentment and heightening American fears, it could achieve no more than to delay the inevitable conflict. Had things gone differently, it might not have even done that much...<br/><br/>Emphasizing simple game mechanics and fast gameplay without sacrificing historical accuracy, each entry in the Grand Admiral line stands alone. However, the core game mechanics remain constant, allowing players to combine ships from different products to create new scenarios and explore any number of &quot;what-if&quot; situations.<br/><br/>Although designed as a hex-n-counter board game, Grand Admiral can be easily adapted to tabletop play using any scale of naval miniatures. So, raise the battle ensign, sound general quarters, and damn the torpedoes -- your destiny awaits!<br/><br/>Grand Admiral: Flashpoint Orange includes the following:<br/><br/><br/>     The Grand Admiral rulebook<br/>     150 full-color counters* representing nearly all American and Japanese forces as of 1922<br/>     Data sheets listing 150 individually-named ships, representing over 50 different classes, from destroyers to super-dreadnoughts<br/>     17 by 22 game board <br/><br/><br/>* Requires some assembly.<br/><br/>(Publisher blurb)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It was 2012 when the Mayans predicted the end of time, but few listened and prepared for the inevitable.  Almost without warning, the Fall of Man came to pass and Man ended his dominion of the Earth with a whimper. Continents were erased, new seas formed, and only a very unlucky few survived the apocalypse. The angle and orbit of the planet had changed, and the only habitable areas remaining on Earth are between the 30th and 45th parallel. As the Earth slowly dies, burning under a closer Sol, the remaining inhabitants struggle to survive.<br/><br/>70 years have passed since the Fall, and what was once the western seaboard of the United States is the last bastion of humanity on the planet.  New settlements have grown over the ashes of the old, the largest being the Free Republic of Phoenix. Phoenix has grown and prospered, its guarded, high walls protecting it from the hazards of the open wastes. Phoenix is the center of the world now, having formed political alliances with many of the remaining settlements, providing electricity and protection in the form of its Centurions in return for manpower, goods, and food.  Ruled by an elected dictator, its laws are strong and absconders are dealt with harshly, but life in the wastes is harsher. Providing tens of thousands a stable life, Phoenix truly is the last hope for civilization, but not everyone wants civilization.<br/><br/>The Anarchists, as the Phoenicians call them, are made up of freedom loving people that will bow to no man&rsquo;s law but their own. Cut off from the much-needed electricity and fresh water produced in Phoenix, they scavenge the lands as their ancestors did, killing anyone that they encounter to survive.  In a perpetual state of conflict with Phoenix and their merciless Centurion warriors, and led by their High Priest or Mor, they will stop at nothing until Phoenix falls and the Free Cities are allowed to be truly Free.<br/><br/>Your adventure begins with the high council of your small, Northwestern village calling you, one of its strongest, bravest citizens to the village hall.  The council tells its chosen ones that the city generator has begun to fail and that you must find and recover a suitable replacement within 30 days or your people will perish and your village with fall to the wastes. Not knowing where to begin and provisioned only with what your village could spare, you set off into the wastes.<br/><br/><br/>Beyond The Fall is a post-apocalyptic game of survival where players must make their way south to Phoenix before running out of food or being killed by Anarchists, starvation, or the wasteland itself.  Along your way you will come upon settlements where you may barter or desperate men who may try to kill you.  The wastes are an inhospitable place for the weak, and only your strength, courage, and your choices will carry you through safely.<br/>You may undertake missions which will reap glory and rewards, may perform acts of courage that will craft your story into legend, or you may take up the cause of the Anarchists who wish to defile and rape the lands for their own benefit.  The choice is yours.<br/><br/>",

The small police station in town is almost falling apart both on the outside and from the inside. And this is were you are. As the two Chief Inspectors of Kalina the players will have to work together to build a strong case against the Serial Killer in only three days. The only problem is that the boss has put a promotion out for the player that builds the strongest case against the Serial Killer. This means that the players will do anything to further their own investigation and all possible to hinder their opponents even though it has to look like they are both working together.<br/><br/>The players will play a card each that indicate a certain coorordinate. A lot of bluffing is involved in the game as there is only a limited cardplays for each player. The coordinates will be stocked with increasing amount of evidence for each day passing of the investigation.The players will also be able to move the serial killer himself in order to hinder the other players investigation by killing off his investigators.<br/><br/>The player, who has built the strongest case against the Serial Killer in three days, by getting the most Case Points, wins the game. Case Points will mainly be gained by having the most of a certain type of evidence.<br/><br/>At the moment Graphic design is beeing conducted by Josh Cappel for the prototype that is going to be released at the Hippodice Competition 2011. Danish playtesters will be needed for final playtests September 2010. Prototype Artwork will be released on September 1st.<br/><br/>",

Players control armies on a map divided into areas.  Some areas contain supply centers, the control of which, allows the player to build another army.  Players write their moves secretly, either moving into an area or supporting another unit.  Players may support the move of an another player.  The object is to control the majority of supply centers.<br/><br/>There are some significant differences that set it apart from the orginal.  The topology is a map of Middle Earth, with Arnor, Rohon, Mordor, Rhovanion, and Gondor, being the &quot;nations&quot; represented.  Mordor begins the game much stronger than the other nations.<br/><br/>In addition to armies there are double armies and triple armies which attack at double and strength but are supplied at single strength.  The ring is special piece that can be held, worn, or transferred by an army.  If worn, it will increase the army&rsquo;s strength (SA to DA, DA to TA, etc.) and will affect victory conditions.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "During the summer of 1917, the Turks were blocking the road to Palestine. They had been retreating until reaching the Gaza, where there reinforced and built extensive trench defenses. The Turks were always tough and after the 1st Battle of Gaza slipped through the British hands, the British also re-equipped- with tanks! It was hoped that these monsters would wreck the Turk defenses and cause them to flee opening up Palestine to the British. Naval monitors would bombard Gaza from the sea. The Turks were not easy prey especially in prepared defenses and with the help of German aircraft above. Once again both prepared for yet another showdown.<br/><br/>The game comes with a 11x17&quot; map, 280 counters, rules. The map scale is about 800 yards per hex. Each combat unit is one platoon to company .<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the designer, Matt Arnold:<br/>Antigrams is a 5-minute 2-player print-and-play abstract strategy game, involving simultaneous tile placement, subtitled &quot;Rock Paper Scissors Tiles&quot;.<br/><br/>Equipment is a stack of 48 identical square tiles, each divided diagonally into a light-color triangle and a dark-color triangle, presumed in these instructions to be white and black.<br/><br/>Choose which player is which color from the two colors on your tiles.<br/><br/>On each turn, both players drop a tile. After the first turn, they alternate having first choice of where to place. Tiles must touch any edge of at least one tile that is already played, or of a location the opponent has currently chosen.<br/><br/>Hiding the front side from the opponent to conceal the tile's rotation, they position their tiles upright with its edge on the table. Simultaneously, when their tiles are both touching the table, they tip their tiles toward each other so the tiles are laying down on the table. Repeat.<br/><br/>Players attempt to form three target shapes with their own color and the opponent's color.<br/><br/>Look for a Black rock which crushes a White scissors, for instance. The game would immediately end in a victory for Black-- unless a White paper is formed at the exact same time, and covers the Black rock. That's one point for White and one point for Black. In that case, the game continues until one player has at least one more winning shape combination on the board than the other. If the score is still tied when the last tiles are played, the game is a draw.<br/><br/>It is possible for two tiles to be part of multiple shapes. For example, a White scissors and White paper can share two tiles and still qualify as two complete shapes.<br/><br/>Strategy Basics:<br/><br/><br/>     Pay attention to what structures your opponent is building, and disrupt them if necessary.<br/>     Remember, with every tile, you are placing your own color and your opponent's color.<br/>     &quot;Telegraph punches that you're not throwing.&quot; Get your opponent to believe you're building toward a particular victory, and suddenly switch to build a different one.<br/><br/><br/>",

Up to 4 players have to fulfill one desire of prince Piast: construct a city from scratch. <br/>Players manage their districts of a newly built town. They have three years, each divided by four seasons, to achieve their final goal: build the most impressive district. In every season players have a couple of actions, represented by rectangular blocks. They can build houses, city walls, and public buildings from them. Discarding them gives players the opportunity to move in citizens and purchase estates beyond the city limit. Finally, players have the possibility to gather resources: wood (needed to construct the buildings), food (needed to feed the citizens and buy an additional action block), and money (needed for estates purchasing). But beware: these actions have an influence on every player and could have a negative impact on unprepared!<br/>In the middle of the board is placed a wheel of time, turning at the end of every season. This natural clock distributes possible citizen tokens and estate cards between players. <br/>Every player have also three tiles with specific missions from the prince. These wishes change every year and let to grant players more favor from the ruler.<br/><br/>",

The pips on all 6 of each die's sides must initially total no more than 21. (This will change throughout gameplay.)<br/>     Players then ROLL their dice, with high roll winning. Ties are ignored in a two-player game; if more than 2 are playing, ties for high number are re-rolled until there is a winner.<br/>     A ROUND continues until one player has won six* ROLLs.<br/>     The loser of a ROUND may elect to either: (a) increase the total number of pips on his die by ONE by replacing one of its faces, or (b) have the winner decrease the total number of pips on his die by ONE by replacing one of its faces (winner's choice of face). In a multiplayer game, losers engage in a single roll-off to determine who gets to choose, with the LOSER winning that right.<br/>     A GAME lasts until one player has won six* ROUNDs.<br/>     A MATCH lasts until one player has won three* GAMEs.<br/>     Between GAMEs, each player must build a new custom D6 whose pips add up to no more than 21.<br/><br/><br/>* This number may be reduced to shorten the game if more than two are playing.<br/><br/>For information on the interesting properties of custom D6 dice, search the Internet for 'Sicherman Dice' and 'Non-Transitive Dice'.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Simple Age of Sail tactical naval miniatures war game with an alternate history twist (and alternate physics and geography). Includes instructions for simple model construction, scenarios, etc. Designed to be played on the front of your refrigerator, but there's no reason it can't be used for evocative fast play AWI/Napoleonic naval war on a horizontal surface.<br/><br/>In Franklin's Sea Columbus actually sailed off the edge of the world. There being no new world, Ben Franklin was undistracted by politics and discovered not only electricity, but fantastic secrets about the Earth's magnetic field that would allow the new copper-bottomed ships to sail safely over the edge of the world and down the ocean on the side. This began a new age of exploration and exploitation, and literally new horizons.<br/><br/>Players command naval groups of two to six ships sailing and fighting on a vertical surface. Movement rules include wind direction and handling differences between different classes of ships, as well as drifting down the sea, of course. Ships are rated for broadside dice and boarding dice. Range reduces firepower.  The effects of damage are noted right on the simple record sheet for easy reference. With lucky rolls enemy ships can strike very quickly, or they may be beaten down with many shots. A ship that loses all its sails will be unable to resist drifting downward toward the abyss...<br/><br/>Game stats and construction plans included for 18 gun sloop of war, 44 gun frigate, 74 gun ship of the line, and 500 ton merchantman. Three scenarios included, two quite asymmetrical and one straightforward shoot 'em up with multiple large ships.<br/><br/>Simple but pleasing ship models are constructed from craft sticks, paper clips, paper, glue, etc with ordinary tools and glue.<br/><br/>(author's note)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a non-replay game based loosely on the 400 Metres track event. Eight players each control a single runner on a staggered lane track - special rules apply for 4 to 7 players.<br/><br/>Each runner has fifteen Bid Tokens, totalling 100 points of Stamina, and for each of the eight Turns a Movement Card is exposed to show the Movement permitted for the top bidder, the second highest bidder, and so on. One or more of the tokens are placed face down in front of the player and the bids examined when all players have made up their minds.<br/><br/>The highest bid claims the first Movement shown on the card, the second highest the second, etc, etc. A Tie-Break Card quickly settles the matter between equal bids. The used Bid Tokens are discarded, except for the Zero token which is taken back into the hand (useful to bluff with!) and the next Turn takes place using a new Movement Card.<br/><br/>Some Movement Cards give a significant Movement advantage to the top bidder, others may have the top three positions gaining equal Movement, but the lower bidders are at a definite disadvantage. All 27 Movement Cards are different (eight are dealt randomly for each race), so bidding tactics and bluffing vary with each race.<br/><br/>Four Movement Cards are on display when the race starts, the one used for the first Turn plus the next three Turns, and at each Turn another Movement Card is revealed, so some forward planning is possible - and necessary! And the staggered lanes means that the true position of the runners is not known until they enter the home straight which deliberately adds to the uncertainty.<br/><br/>If heats and/or semi-finals are run half of the unused Stamina can be carried forward to the next round or Final, and in any event unused Stamina can help a runner 'win' a photo finish if runners are level after eight Turns.<br/><br/>Although designed as a multi-player game for eight players the game can be played by as few as four players with the special rules provided. It has excellent possibilities for Play-by-(e)Mail.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A semi-abstract, cooperative game designed to teach project management techniques.<br/><br/>The game takes place on an 18x18 grid. The players take the role of project managers in a company. At the start of the game each player has a single project in play. Projects begin in a single space on the board, and each turn grow out one space orthogonally in all directions.  On a player's turn only his or her projects grow.<br/><br/>If a project grows into the edge of the board, the game ends in a loss for all players.<br/><br/>To finish projects, players utilize a mix of concept work and production work tokens. Placing a token on the board blocks projects from growing into that space.  If a project cannot grow it counts as finished, and the players score one point. After a project is completed, a replacement is added in a semi-random square.<br/><br/>Concept work tokens are taken from a shared pool of 10, and once placed remain in play indefinitely.<br/><br/>Additionally, each player has 2 production work tokens. These tokens only last for one round.<br/><br/>A player's turn consists of doing one of the following: placing a single concept work token, moving a single concept work token, or placing both production work tokens.<br/><br/>That player then grows his or her projects. If two (or more) projects collide they combine into a single compound project. Compound projects grow on the turns of every player who has a project involved, and their multiple growth points make them much harder to finish. Additionally, compound projects are still only worth a single point.<br/><br/>The players win if they can finish eight projects. However, after every other project is finished, another project is added to the mix. This means that the end game requires managing seven projects simultaneously.<br/><br/>Designed by a team at the Singapore-MIT GAMBIT Game Lab for the MIT Sloan School of Management.<br/><br/>",

Your goal is to engage and beat the opponent's squadron of fighters.<br/><br/>This game is played on a three-dimensional gameboard of four levels.  Each level is 49 hexes.  One hex = 5000 km.  The levels are separated by a distance of 10,000 km.  By using the special four-sided die, you maneuver your fighters to engage the enemy without flying off the edge of the board - and out of the Altara system.<br/><br/>Two or more players can play this game simultaneously, each being in command of a squadron of fighters.  A squadron may have one, two, three or four fighters.<br/><br/>At the start of the game, each fighter has eight energy units.  Should the number drop to zero, the fighter is considered destroyed and must be taken out of the game.<br/><br/>The game is played in turns, each one being made up of three phases:  Phase One - Movement, Phase Two - firing and Phase Three - damage assessment.<br/><br/>The special die is rolled - player rolling highest chooses to move and fire first or last in the phases.  Damages are totaled and tallied on the score sheets. Movement can be done on the same level or the fighters may move up or down one level.  Attack strength is determined by distance to the target.<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the last remaining fighter on the game board.<br/><br/>",

You want to conquer the world by building some kind of Doomsday Device! In order to do so, you will have to give orders to your lowly Minions which will try to perform evil deeds, collect valuable resources, spread terror, fight heroes and cause general mayhem. Oh, another thing: there seem to be a few other Evil Lords around who are trying to conquer the world themselves: you will have to do it before them.<br/><br/>Apart from your Dark Tower, there are 6 places in the Realm: the Countryside, the Wood, the Sanctuary, the City, the Castle and the Dungeon. There are 6 basic orders you could give to a Minion: Bring me some Gold, Bring me some Food, Bring me some Mana, attempt a Diplomacy Mission, attempt a War Mission, and Have some Fun. (Note that the Minion&rsquo;s concept of &quot;Diplomacy&quot; includes poisoning, forging, stealing and so on). <br/>Each turn you could give to a Minion just 1 of these 12 orders, thus selecting either what must he door where should him go, by means of placement on an apposite  board. <br/>For example, if you assign him the task of recovering some Gold, he will decide by himself if looking for it in the Dungeon or in the Sanctuary or elsewhere. <br/>On the other hand, if you order him to go to the Wood, it will be upon to him to decide either of having some Fun, or looking for Mana, or else.  <br/>The Minion will decide it by drawing an Evil Deed Card.<br/><br/>There are all sort of Evil Deeds, ranging  from &quot;Poison the Good King in the Castle&quot; to &quot;Beat the Monks for Fun in the Sanctuary&quot;, an each will identify univocally both where the Minion will go and what will he try to do. <br/>The chance of actually being able to perform the Evil Deed will depend on chance (die roll), special ability of the Minion (such as &quot;Violence&quot;, &quot;Stealth&quot;, &quot;Persuasion&quot; and so on; each kind on Minion has his own) and on the nature of the Evil Deed. <br/>It could be that after the Evil Deed determination there are Minions of different Dark Lord in the same Place: in that case they will not tolerate the presence of the other(s) and they will fight until the other(s) will die. Also some Evil Deed Missions will involve a fighting with a Hero (randomly drawn from the Hero Deck). <br/>By performing Evil Deeds successfully you will be able to  collect basic resources (Gold, Food and Mana), Special Items (to increase the capabilities of your Minions), and components for your Doomsday devices.<br/><br/>In addition, as you progress in your path of darkness, you will become both feared and hated by the Heroes of the Realm: while being feared is a good thing (Aid Minions in combat), since will aid your minions in combat situations, being hated too much could bring trouble, since will increase the probability of you being attacked by Heroes.<br/><br/>",

Players can also stop an opponent's chain from extending by playing an End Chain card which forces the player to play a different End Chain card to start their chain again.

Each batter card also gives the number of games the player appeared in along with the team stint. This is included for those of you wishing to conduct realistic player transactions during a season. Each pitcher is rated for: Overall pitching ability, propensity to keep runners off the bases, to give up hits, to walk batters, to strike out batters, to throw wild pitches, to hit batsmen and to commit balks. Each pitcher card also included the number of games the pitcher appeared in, along with the number of games he appeared as a starter. As with the batting cards, a team stint number is also included.<br/><br/><br/>Each team has its own fielding chart, with each position player listed, along with the positions he played, the number of games in which he appeared in that position, his error rating for that position, and his throwing arm rating (if he is an outfielder.)<br/><br/>Unique control system controls the flow of the game. You will get a visual picture of the batter/pitcher duel as each at-bat is conducted. The great hurlers will generally control the game, but a weak batter will surprise the ace at any moment!<br/><br/>Fast action cards included, ready for printing. You may print them 1 or 2-sided.

        "description": "Before the German blitzkrieg stormed across Europe in 1939-40, a group of elite soldiers prepared the way by seizing bridges and other strategic targets ahead of the attack. In the following years, these warrior-spies, known as the Brandenburgers, operated behind enemy lines around the globe, from Russia and Yugoslavia to Egypt, Iraq, and India, Often bending the rules of war while completing their daring covert missions. Trained to be mobile and independent, steeped in foreign languages and customs, and expert in numerous military specialties, the Brandenburgers influenced the world's special forces long after World War II.<br/><br/>Brandenburg is a tactical wargame for up to three players, depicting the actions of the German commando force throughout the entire WWII. The game's map is assembled using hexagonal tiles, a method which simulates the fog of war and increases the game's replayability over time. Counters represent individual units, with specialized infantry (soldiers, medics, engineers, scouts and snipers) able to pack, equip and use a wide variety of weapons and gear to carry out their missions. Civilians, agents and partisans populate the conflict zone, acting as influential factors capable of tilting the balance of power to either side's favor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Background<br/> Zombie Masters uses the popular Zombie theme and adds some new twists to the Zombie games.<br/> This time you take the role of a Zombie Master, who creates these &quot;undead&quot; bodies and sends them out to control the world. Everybody is wondering about why Zombies are driven to eat brrraiiiins... we will give you the answer! <br/> We all know that knowledge is a drug for mankind (just ask Faust) - it's a drug for Zombies as well. Our Zombies don't want to live with a brain all the time and therefore, feed upon the Living to get there wits back. Of course, this process is very slow and it would take tons of Einstein brains to spark rational thinking in a Zombie. But who cares, if you are &quot;undead&quot; and have all the time in the world.  Additionally, if you are a very dedicated and strong human and have the (mis)fortune to get bitten and turned into a Zombie yourself, you may be lucky and retain some of your basic knowledge regarding routine tasks/skills. So a cop may be able to still fire a pistol - though much slower and maybe not very accurately or the Zombie nurse may still be able to perform the task of giving you an injection.<br/> And naturally,  - intelligent brains are much more attractive to Zombies than &bdquo;no-brainers&ldquo;.  Thus, a special resource is made available to Zombie Masters: Beer! Too much beer makes human brains unattractive for Zombies and those people who drink a lot of beer are not eaten by Zombies. And  you,  of course, as an evil Zombie Master can have the beer infested people fight or work among Zombies as well - they simply will not notice it ;-)  <br/>  <br/>General game description<br/> Zombie Masters is a game for two players, who fight for control of a city or other location. Each player represents a &bdquo;Zombie Master&ldquo;, who is able to create Zombies and control them to achieve his goals.<br/> Zombie Masters tiles are used to build a strategy for this game. Each player choose a set of 30 unit- or character tiles and put them into a chosen order in five turn sets consisting of six cards each.<br/> A game turn consists of the following actions:<br/> 1) Produce Zombie Masters resources<br/>2) Play Zombie tiles face down to locations you would like to attack<br/>3) Players alternately put Zombies or Humans on the Zombie tiles<br/>4) Turn over the tiles you like and place Zombies on them. Discard Zombies which are surplus or can't be played on the tile<br/>5) Starting with Initiative 0, use the action of that tile or attack with it until all tiles have been used<br/>6) Seize locations if there is no enemy Zombie or citizen left and at least one of your Zombies/Humans occupy the location<br/>7) Continue to feed &quot;living&quot; Zombies<br/><br/>Zombie Masters will include a base set of 30 tiles for two players as well as a whole lot of Zombies and the remote city of Riverview to battle for. More strategy boards, unit tiles, locations and Zombie/Human tokens will follow up in expansion and scenario packs.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Developer:  Star Siege offers the player a friendly game of strategy that is easy to learn and fun to play.<br/><br/>&quot;The Zyntrac galaxy is the closest galaxy to the Black Hole.  Of the Zyntrac Galaxy, the four closest galactic sectors contain the most energy and power of any galactic sectors in the universe.  The very essence of this untapped power is reason inough for all Interstellar War Lords to battle for possession of them.  Players become Interstellar War Lords in Star Siege and use the forces of the Black Hole to gain strategic power over their oppenents, thus limiting their movements and eventually eliminating them from the game.  Enter the Star Siege and let yourself be cast into a galaxy where space and time do collide.<br/><br/>OBJECT OF THE GAME is to conquer the universe by strategically occupying planets in such a manner as to limit your opponent's movements and eliminate them from the game.<br/><br/>EQUIPMENT includes a game board, one die, 16 men and 144 planetary chips.<br/><br/>The Star Siege game board is separated into four galactic sectors:  Sector 1 is the closest sector to the Black Hole and contains 6 planets.  Sectors 2 and 3 are the second and third closest to the Black Hole and contain 12 planets each.  Sector 4 is the farthest from the Black Hole and contains 6 planets.<br/><br/>Each player receives 4 men of one colour and can use 1 to 4 men per game.  All players must use the same number of men.<br/><br/>Each player receives 36 planetary chips of one colour.  These are used to designate ownership of planets.  When players come to rest on a planet they place one of their planetary chips in the space provided and place their men on top.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY:  Roll of die determines order of play.  First player places one of him men and planetary chips on any unoccupied planet of his choice.  Play continues in a clockwise direction with each player doing the same until all planets are occupied.  Die is now re-rolled to determine who moves first.<br/><br/>When a players man comes to rest upon an opponents unprotected planet, he invades that planet and replaces the man and chip with his own.<br/><br/>Players try to enter the Black Hole by moving up along their own planets.  Upon entering the Black Hole the player can move his man to any unprotected planet on the board.<br/><br/>A player's man can only be eliminated from the game when it is &quot;stranded&quot;.  A player is said to be stranded when one of his men is surrounded by his opponent's planets.<br/><br/>A player is out of the game when all of his men have been eliminated.<br/><br/>Game comes with instructions for basic, intermediate, advanced and expert level play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "October, 1929: The Republic is crumbling. With the death of Gustav Stresemann on October 3, 1929 and the crash of the American Stock Exchange, Germany's recovery from the devastating Great War now is in doubt. Communist, Fascist and Republican forces clash over ideology and erupt into a war of words and violence. Unemployment begins to spiral out of control while the German people grow restless. Rallies are held by charismatic leaders as lawmakers struggle to find answers. Amongst the chaos, a new figure will head the German nation.<br/><br/>Weimar: German Politics 1929-1933 is a two-player political game that tries to simulate the chaos of Germany prior to Hitler's appointment to chancellor. Will you take the role of the Social Democratic leadership, staving off the extreme ideologies of Communism and Fascism? Using your political influence and paramilitary forces, will you try to gain control of the Reichstag, or send Germany to the brink of anarchy? Can you change history, or is Germany doomed to repeat it?<br/><br/>Weimar is a block/CDG in which one side plays the SPD and the other plays the NSDAP. A third Communist force is played by both players. Players hold rallies, street fights, build alliances, and try to win the hearts and minds of the German people.<br/><br/>Victory can be achieved in multiple ways, with both parties being able to gain influence in each electoral area and score them in each election phase. Influence is gained by holding rallies and bringing political and paramilitary forces to both &quot;encourage&quot; and intimidate the German people. Alternatively for the Nazis, they can use events to increase chaos and unrest in order to bring down the weak parliamentary government. For the SPD, they can use special actions to stop the Nazi political machine, including the elimination of its leadership.<br/><br/>",

No draws are possible in Inversion.<br/><br/>Players move alternatingly, starting with White.<br/><br/>The player must first place a stone of his or her color in any empty cell.<br/><br/>A hex is any set of seven cells consisting of one center cell and its six surrounding cells. The dominant color of a hex is the color occupying four or more of the seven cells. If the player&rsquo;s stone occupies the last empty cell in a hex, the stones of the dominant color in that hex are replaced by stones of the non-dominant color. This is called an inversion.<br/><br/>The placement of a stone often completes multiple hexes simultaneously. In this case, the player may choose the order in which to invert the hexes. Each of the completed hexes must be inverted once and only once.<br/><br/>",

If you manage to rack up enough kills, you can even upgrade your armor and weapon to make sure you last longer and the zerg don't.<br/><br/>Players start off by rolling the zerg dice to see what they're up against, then proceeding to the attack phase where they try to roll as many kill shots as possible. If they survive they can proceed to see a medic and/or buy upgrades for weapons and armor. Players can also use different attack tactics to increase their survival. Winner is decided by a variety of rules of the players choice. Eg. Last survivor, most kills or points after a set number of rounds etc.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the rules book:<br/><br/>Family kit contains five engaging games that combine U.S. geography with the math of numbers, data, logic, and strategy. The games are ideal for children 7 to 13 to play with parents, siblings, or friends. Children a little younger can play them with an adult or older child. The directions include ways to adjust the games to fit the age and experience of the players.<br/><br/>Games included are: (1) Guess my state; (2) Take a trip; (3) Guess my rule; (4) Capture states; and (5) Closest match.<br/><br/>(1) Guess my state - In this game, similar to &quot;Twenty Questions,&quot; players ask questions to try to identify a secret state that one player has chosen. At the start of the game, the state cards are laid out face up. Players take turns tryin to identify the secret state by asking yes-or-no questions (e.g., Did it become a state in the 1800s? Does your state border Canada?). After each question is answered, the states that have been ruled out are removed from the layout. The player who narrows the layout down to the secret state is the winner. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards.<br/><br/>(2) Take a trip - In this game, players navigate around the U.S. by finding states that border one another. At the start of the game, one state card is turned up. On the first turn, a player puts down a state card that borders it from their hand of 3 cards. The next player puts down a card that borders that state, and so on. For example, if Texas is turned up at the start of the game, on the first turn a player could put down Oklahoma, since it borders Texas. On the second turn, a player could put down Kansas, since it borders Oklahoma. The game is over when one player plays all of their cards or no more cards can be placed. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards. May also be played cooperatively with all players' cards face up.<br/><br/>(3) Guess my rule - In this game,players try to discover a secret rule that one player is using to sort the states into two groups. For instance, a secret rule could be &quot;borders on an ocean.&quot; States that border an ocean would go in one group; states that do not border an ocean would go in the other group. the Rule Maker selects about six states form the layout ans sorts them into two groups according to the rule. Players take turns trying to figure out the rule by choosing a state that has not yet been sorted and saying which group they think it belongs in. After three turns in a row in which players sort states correctly, they may begin to guess the rule. The first player to guess the rule wins. Use either the East or West cards, or for more of a challenge, play with all 50 state cards.<br/><br/>(4) Capture states - In this game, similar to &quot;War,&quot;players compare the states according to a certain feature. At the start of the game, players choose a state feature, such as year of statehood. On each round, all players put out a state card at the same time from their stack of face down cards. The player with the state that has the biggest number for the chosen feature (e.g., became a state most recently) captures all the cards played in the round. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>(5) Closest match - In this game, players use math to find states that are most alike. At the start of the game, players choose a state feature, such as number of libraries. In each round, they compare the states in their hand to a Goal state. For instance, if the Goal is Colorado, which has 253 libraries, they find the card in their hand of five cards that has closest to 253 libraries. They compare their chosen states, and the player with the closest of all takes the cards played in the round. The player with the most cards at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>Contents:<br/> - large map of U.S. for reference<br/> - 26 Blue fact cards, one for each of <br/>   the states in the Eastern U.S. <br/>   (sorry, no Washington, D.C.)<br/> - 24 Red fact cards, one for each of <br/>   the states in the Western U.S.<br/> - 10 Wild cards<br/> - 10 sample rules/question cards<br/><br/>",

You can predict first 3 places (at races and championships) or winning team on individual matches. You can only predict only one certain place, if afraid to lose points (money).<br/><br/>After everyone have placed their bets (written down), according to rules for certain part (10 up above) leading player uses dices and cards to make the final results. Favourites getting better chances and so on. The 2 Joker cards in the pack act as a Act Of God in this betting game. They can remove a winner of bring a loser to front. Rules for Jokers and how to use them come with each part separately. Each part has different conditions for winning, but main idea is to collect most money at the end of each coupon (races, matches etc).<br/><br/>PS! Rules say that these cards for predicting the races can also used for real life races as well and refers to the product with the same name used for only gambling purpose.<br/><br/>",

Meratoo is the hapless spider who must cross the web of Attercop. Meratoo, must gently feel his way across the web before being caught. Hidden, Attercop stalks - probing, deceiving, sneaking for her prey.<br/><br/>It's devious, it's cunning, it's sneaking good fun !<br/><br/>How the game is played, from game designer :-<br/><br/>Attercop is a game for two players. One player is Attercop, a spider with a reputation for cunning, and a lady with an appetite. The other is Meratoo, a little spider nervously trying to cross her web. The aim of the game is for Meratoo to make his way from one side of the web to the other, whilst Attercop tries to catch him.<br/><br/>The web consists of 44 connected points, each covered by a &quot;blank&quot; tile.  Meratoo travels from blank tile to blank tile, gently feeling his way accross the Web trying to avoid running into Attercop. Meanwhile, Attercop has a number of tiles to represent her legs, which tease the web and try to bluff the Meratoo player into her grasp, by being able the change the position of the tiles on the web. Here's the catch: the Attercop tiles remain face-down on the web, undistinguishable from the blank tiles, and they can be moved along with the rest of the web tiles. This is how Attercop probes her way around the web.<br/><br/>For Attercop the game is all about bluffing and enticing Meratoo into her grasp. For Meratoo it is all about staying alert, testing the web and calling Attercop's bluff. The game is fun to play, generates lots of laughs , is a light-hearted and quick game, and is great for both kids and adults.<br/><br/>",

The approach is that each weapon or tested action has what's called &quot;The Solution&quot;. The Solution is a range of numbers from which each player chooses one of those numbers and writes it down on a piece of paper. In order to be successful, the attacking (or testing) player must match the defending player's choice for that Solution. So, for example, if a Solution is listed at 4, each player chooses either a 1, 2, 3, or 4 for that Solution. If player A chooses 2, player B must also choose 2 in order to succeed. If he instead chooses 1, 3, or 4 the test fails. Better characters will have lower solutions (1 or 2) and worse characters can have solutions ranging as high as 8 or 9.<br/><br/>",

Once the fork, spoon and plate cards have been played to the table in front of the player, they can start to play cards for their meal. But other players can use waiters to steal cards, and chef cards to force other players to make certain pasta dishes. Also the mouse card can be used to spoil another players dish.

The Irish Republican Army is controlled by the IRA Player and the British Army and Irish Free State Army by the Government Player. In both games the IRA Player seizes strategic buildings across Dublin and must hold them as long as possible despite being outnumbered 10-1. The Government Player must use his superior forces to retake the city block by block, helped by artillery, bombers, gunboats, tanks and armoured cars. But the IRA is barricaded in thick-walled buildings where a few men can hold up an entire battalion and the centre of Dublin was reduced to rubble before they surrendered. Each side earns victory points during the game and while the IRA Player is unlikely to win the battle he may earn enough VPs to win the game.<br/><br/>Includes:<br/><br/>Map (33 x 22 inches)<br/><br/>Countersheet with 280 &frac12; inch counters<br/><br/>Rules Booklet<br/><br/>",

This will launch the hat forwards toward the target area.

All players launch all nine of their hats, immediately in flight during the call &quot;HAT SHOOT&quot; does count. The round ends. All players count and record their scores.

Being skilled natural engineers, and determined to reclaim their lands, the Maoris constructed forts called 'pahs' (or pas) on disputed territory and dared white men (pakehas) to attack. The British and Colonial troops seemed only too happy to oblige and, when enough losses had been inflicted to satisfy utu ('revenge' or 'payment'), the Maoris simply evacuated their trenches and rifle-pits. The conflict was also marked (later) by some guerrilla fighting, but its main feature was the defence and reduction of these ingenious native forts.&quot;<br/><br/>Essentially, the game is organized as a skirmish around the taking/defending of a &quot;native&quot; fort of the defending player's design. System uses d6 and d12 for various checks.<br/><br/>Each figure represents one man. Rules were written to support 25mm figures, but can be adapted to different scales.<br/><br/>This simple system does include rules for Morale.<br/><br/>Rules set appear in Wargames Illustrated #63 (December 1992)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;Advance the Flag is a set of rules designed for medium to large scale wargames set in the American Civil War. It is intended to be suitable for refighting actual battles as well as for hypothetical scenarios, one-of, equal-strength competition style games, and free form campaigns in which the tabletop encounters arise from strategic decisions made by the players. It is worth pointing out here that although some purists regard the last three options as somehow inferior to the historical refight, they generally present players with more challenging situations and allow them more opportunity to exercise their tactical skills, without the benefit of hindsight. Such games can be just as faithful to the &quot;spirit&quot; of the period as a slavish reconstruction, and are often more fun. These rules are intended to give the players an enjoyable and fast moving experience, while at the same time reflecting - as far as is possible with what is essentially a form of entertainment - the conditions of the real conflict. A game involving several hundred figures a side can easily be complete in an evening. After a few attempts you will probably be able to remember most of the rules which you will need, and so will be able to keep things moving without constantly referring to the book. This leaves you free to enjoy the game and admire your carefully painted figures - which is what it is about, after all.&quot; <br/>From the Authors Introduction<br/><br/>",

The World map is divided into multiple territories connected by land or sea. All Seven Major Powers with many Neutral Countries are included; all theaters of War involved from fall 1939 through 1945 including Research up to the Atomic Bomb. This game is fast and at most there will be less than 6 Mof&rsquo;s per Major Power on the board at any time.<br/><br/>Each player takes control of the Axis or the Allies. Each Major Power when it enters the WAR gets its own specific Operational deck of cards that the player can draw from during each round or season to form his hand. The number of cards is determined by the control of key territories and conquered Neutral countries. These cards represent Military forces and Supplies. With these in hand, the player may now create Mof&rsquo;s, move Mof&rsquo;s and initiate land, sea and air combat along with Warfare and research. He may play some, all or no card at all during any turn that is part of a round until each player passes in succession. The game lasts 20 rounds or seasons. Although this game is card driven, a player is never restricted to any territory and may operate any Mof anywhere on the map board.<br/><br/>The Axis win as soon as they control at least 2 Allied Major Powers.<br/>The Allies win as soon as they control Berlin and Tokyo.<br/>Any other result at the end of winter 1945 is an Axis win.<br/><br/>This game tries to capture the WW2 strategies and tactics and tries to recreate the feel and excitement of a complete global conflict in less than 90 minutes. Did we succeed? You have the answer.<br/><br/> <br/> ",

        "description": "Edited, March 26th 2015.<br/>RuckBowl is a two-player Rugby Union board game, where players control two teams of rugby-men. Each team has only 10 pawns (instead of 15). There are 4 forwards in RuckBowl, and each forward represents 2 real forwards. The n&deg;10 in RuckBowl represents the real fly-half and the real scrum-half. So the 10 pawns in RuckBowl represent 15 real players. Why 10 pawns? Because it is easier to manipulate 10 pawns than 15 pawns. The game becomes quicker and more nervous with 10 pawns.<br/>RuckBowl uses a square-grid board: 15 columns by 28 lines : almost the BloodBowl pitch...<br/><br/>The game is played taking turns: each turn is divided in two segments: Segment I for placing players and launching play, and Segment II for the current play.<br/><br/>What happens in the Segment I :<br/>Kick-off, Re-start Kick, 22 m drop out, Scrum, Lineout, Penalty kick.<br/><br/>There is several options in the Segment II: <br/>Option 1. The coach moves his players, passes the ball, kicks the ball, attempt crash charges or tackles, or attempt a drop-goal, <br/>Option 2 or 3. The coach declares a Ruck or a Maul. <br/>Option 4. The coach declares a Mark.<br/><br/>Some actions need dice rolls: tackle, crash charge, kick, Ruck, Maul, Scrum, etc. A bad die roll can lead to a Scrum, a penalty, or a turn-over, etc. The opposition can react by: intercepting the ball, tackling the ball carrier, catching a kicked ball, etc... Each team can score with Try, Drop Goal, and Penalty Kick. And don&rsquo;t forget: passing the ball to a team mate in front of you is totally forbidden !<br/><br/>RuckBowl is a game where you must make the good decision all the time : what can I make ? pass the ball, kick, kicking in touch, move the ball carrier, declare a ruck ?<br/><br/>In order to customize your team, you can use Team cards.<br/><br/>Each player has his own profile :<br/>Move (for...movements).<br/>Power (for melees : scrum, ruck, maul).<br/>Catch (for catching the free ball, after a kick or a bounce).<br/>Impact (for tackles).<br/>Pass (for passes).<br/>Kick (when the ball is kicked).<br/><br/>RuckBowl is a complex game, for 14 year old (or more).<br/><br/>",

Play it to the end until you are able to retire and enjoy the American dream.<br/><br/>To start the game you need a minimum of two (2) players and a maximum of twelve (12), the more players in the game, the better the game runs, between seven and ten players would be ideal, although the game&rsquo;s dynamics allows other players to join in at any time, even after the game has already started, as long as they start up from the square marked as &lsquo;Start&rsquo;. Any of the players can also double up as a the Bank and all players get a &lsquo;Profession&rsquo; card and 5.000 (five thousand) game dollars to start.<br/><br/>Put the two sets of cards on their appropriate location on the board, that is, the cards that say 'Professions' on the space marked 'Professions' and the 'Main Board' cards on the spot next to them, you pick up a &lsquo;Main Board&rsquo; card every time the board instructs you to pick up a card and follow its instructions.<br/><br/>The game is uni-directional.   Use one die, this will tell you the number of squares that you have to move your token.  Follow the instructions of the square where you land. If you have to go back any space(s) then follow the instructions for that square also.  Except for the Professions cards, all other cards go back to the bottom of the pile.  If you get deported you must start again from the beginning (JFK).   Lose a day is the same as miss a turn.   You can be married in your country and still get married in this game. (This is just a game)<br/><br/>Profession:   The Professions card, stays with you while you are playing, since it indicates the salary your are to collect every week.    If you get another profession card,  you can keep it if you wish hold two or three jobs at the same time. You can hold up to three jobs.<br/><br/>Money:   Follow the instructions on the game board only when you land on them, not as you pass. (Except when it comes to 'Pay day', every time you pass Pay Day you get pay, even if you don't land exactly on it).  That is collect your salary as you pass.  This is the only exception, you are entitle to your salary as you pass, you don't need to have an exact landing, but if you land right on the Pay day square, collect twice your salary.  All bills have the value of an imaginary game dollar, whether Euro, Liras, Sucres, Pesos, Franks, etc., so 1000 liras is the same as 1000 dollars or 1000 Pesos, for the purposes of the game.<br/><br/>End of game: All players that retire win.   To retire, only a perfect landing on the final square is allowed.   At the end of the game, if you have 6 or less spaces to go, you need that exact number to come out on the die in order to beat the game, if you get more on the die than what you need,  wait for your next turn before trying again.   Your game ends on the square that reads: Retire happy, where the retired players can walk into the Sunshine scenery area, to wait for the rest of the players (Imagine that!) Retire back to your country, move to Florida or Hawaii, whatever your dream might be.<br/><br/>",

A conspicous amount of sheer data!!<br/><br/>The system is very basic: all teams are rated for attack and defense and comparing the teams involved in each match, you roll a couple of 6-sided dice for each team to get how many points each one scored during a match. Sounds easy? It is. But there are also a few modifiers, that may dramatically alter the result of the game, with surprising effect (like a possible underdog win over the favourite of the tournament).<br/>Easy to set up and very fast to complete an entire tournament (an hour or so for most of the tournaments).<br/><br/>",

In particular, the em quad (a piece of type without a letter, used to introduce a space of em width) was used as it approximated a cube and had a nick in one face (to indicate the front of the piece of type). <br/>Players cast five or seven em quads on a flat surface and count the number of nicks showing on the tops of the quads. All players agree on a stake. Players than cast the em quads the same number of times and the highest scoring player wins the stake. The remaining players then cast the quads again and the lowest scoring player has to pay the highest scoring player the stake.<br/><br/>This description is based on a description from the early 19th century, an excerpt of which can be read here: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.poormojo.org/pmjadaily/archives/026778.php\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.poormojo.org/pmjadaily/archives/026778.php</a><br/><br/>",

Bach is also an exciting game of chance and skill that introduces some basic elements of music theory without detracting from the playability of the game.  Bach is a thoughtful and cahallenging game for anyone from the age of 10 to adult, regardless of any previous knowledge of music theory.<br/><br/>Each player takes turns drawing cards and moving notes to form scales.  The first player to form the required scales wins the game.<br/><br/>The first game may take about 1 1/2 hours.  Once you know how to play, each game will average about an hour.<br/><br/>Game components are:<br/><br/>1 board<br/>26 plastic chips with green and blue stickers on opposite sides.<br/>2 information cards<br/>23 key cards<br/>65 interval cards<br/>rulebook<br/><br/>The board is placed between opponents so that each is facing one of the note rows corresponding to the color on their chips.  All notes are place on the note rows so that each note matches the letters and symbols in each square.<br/><br/>The cards are separated into two decks of interval and key cards and placed face down beside the board.  The green player draws the top key card.  It tells you the scales that you have to form to win the game, and it must stay hidden until the end of the game.  The blue player does the same.  The rest of the key cards are put away.<br/><br/>The green player always goes first.  He/she draws an interval card, showing it to their opponent.  The card tells how many squares you can move one &quot;note&quot; as well as the direction that can be moved.<br/><br/>Game play continues until one of the players has formed their scales, and shouts &quot;I win&quot; or something similar.  If this is shouted and the player has not formed their correct scales, play continues and that player loses a turn.  The game is over when one player has completed the scales indicated on their interval card.<br/><br/>",

Now the oceans are warming, and the Poles have fractured into Icebergs of four different colors melting into the sea.<br/><br/>The Colors of Cold, which are responsible for maintaining the climate of the Icecaps, have become separated. They have drifted north and south and mixed together in the center of the ocean: the play area for our game.<br/><br/>Realizing their plight, the Polar Bears and Penguins have taken responsibility for restoring the climate of their environment. They know that the pattern of the Colors of Cold, which nature took so long to create, can be reset with their help. They must help the colors return to their Polar patterns before the ice melts.<br/><br/>What you do.<br/>Play the Polar Bears or Penguins responsible for returning the melting icebergs to their poles.  The polar animals work alone or in pairs. Too many false moves and the bergs will be gone forever.<br/><br/>Take-away-thought &ldquo;Nature can heal with our help&rdquo;.<br/>Nature is quite capable of restoring the right conditions for life, it just needs a little help from the life forms it supports sometimes...<br/><br/>(From the publisher website: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.gamewhys.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.gamewhys.com</a>)<br/><br/>",

They are put in the hollows on the board in such a way that they won't slip out of place. The large wooden die with extra-deep indentations comes with a board that will be appreciated also by sighted people.<br/><br/>Frank Stark has designed a game that is fun to play with the entire family.<br/><br/>A player who believes he is on his final spurt can still be pushed back by a 'stopper' die roll, or an opponent moves your own piece back again - this causes lots of trouble and mischievous joy, no matter whether the player can see or not.<br/><br/>Knowing the way Frank Stark is, it is quite clear that he wouldn't think of just one game for one board - so Camino comes with an additional bonus game and two more variants to choose from.<br/><br/>... And why shouldn't Camino be played also by people who can see but are blindfolded?<br/><br/>",

YOU'RE NEXT!&quot;<br/><br/>The quiet and desolate town of Santa Mira is being invaded by alien spores that have drifted through space propelled by the force of light.<br/>People have started to accuse their loved ones of being impostors but are however dismissed for being part of some mass hysteria. But you know better, you've seen the signs.  You know that these people are being replaced with duplicates of themselves, grown from plantlike pods while sleeping.<br/><br/>Now it's up to you if these Pod People are not to replace the entire human race before they move on to the next world. If only you knew for certain whom and whom not to...<br/><br/>Based upon the science fiction novel by Jack Finney. In The Body Snatchers the players are secretly taking on the roles as both Pod People and Humans to either fight to absorb the world or to save it from being utterly vanquished.<br/><br/>In turns the players will choose one of the characters on the board to move around the city of Santa Mira and perform a number of available actions that are accessible at the different locations. The Pod People seek to infiltrate the city and must do so by secretly assigning Influence cards from their hand to the different locations.<br/><br/>The Humans play in the same fashion but as they will be outnumbered and seek to sabotage the invasion, they must try to assigning as low Influence as they possibly can without raising too much suspicion on their part. If they're not detected and manage to hinder the aliens from influencing more than half of the city within one week they have succeeded. But if the city has been overrun by then the world shall never wake up again.<br/><br/>&quot;The seed is planted... now terror grows.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Introduction<br/><br/>&quot;The Thousand Bomber Raid is a participation game based on a Lancaster Bomber raid on Hanover on 14 October 1943. It is intended to be played with about 10 players and 1 or 2 Umpires, in less than 1 hour. Each player is intended to fly one bomber; however it is quite possible to have 2 or even 3 players for each bomber. The maximum number of bombers a single Umpire can handle is about 10.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>For a small rules set, this has some intriguing and innovative features. Physical tasks are required to make certain checks during the game. For example... pilots are required to toss a prop joystick up in the air and catch it in order to perform tasks and engineers must assemble small Lego patterns under time pressure to repair components. The Umpire shines a powerful flashlight in the eyes of pilots while they are performing tasks if they are &quot;caught in search the searchlights.&quot;<br/><br/>Navigation is an especially important feature of the game, both for purposes of finding the target, and for staying with other bombers so as not to make easy prey for German night fighters.<br/><br/>Each bomber needs to be represented by a miniature. Game requires d6s, copies of various printed charts and maps, a dartboard along with distinctive darts for each player, a flashlight, a thick dowel (or other prop joystick), and some Lego (or similar) building blocks.<br/><br/>Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #91 (April 1995)<br/><br/>",

However, being an awkward sort, I'm not happy with the rules currently available. The main  reason for this is the scale at which commercial rules operate. They're all designed for squadrons of boats with relatively little attention being paid to detail in terms of individual vessels. These rules are intended to fill in the gap left by commercial sets, and enable you to fight actions in which each vessel is an 'individual.' They're best suited to games with no more than one or three boats per player, as any more tends to result in the game being too slow, and measurements are given in inches.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Rules set covers Movement, Gunfire, Damage, Fires, Sick-Berth Attendants, Depth-Charges, Torpedoes, Damage Cards, and the use of the Models/Miniatures.<br/><br/>Required for play: Ship Models (1:72 scale or similar), charts from the rules, a playing surface with a map or terrain, a set of polyhedral dice (d4, d8, d10, d12, d20, d100), string, and a simple set of damage cards (instructions to create these are include in the rules).<br/><br/>Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #94 (July 1995)<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This 4-dimensional chess variant, using the standard 16 chesspieces and pawns, is played on a 4x4x4x4 board. (A printable 2D version of the board is provided, with coordinate numbers in each square.) This printable gameboard is laid out as a 4x4 arrangement of 16 &quot;levels&quot;, each level being a 4x4 2D chessboard. Alternatively, 4 3D 4x4x4 gameboards set up in a row are usable. The game is available on Zillions, in a version by L Lynn Smith.<br/><br/>Piece moves are translated as directly as possible from 2D to 4D, with some adaptations for play balance. So a rook now can move not only north-south and east-west, but up-down and side to side, too, for a maximum of 8 possible directions. Bishops move diagonally within each level, and may also move diagonally from level to level, which simplifies the move somewhat, changing the bishop from a fully 4D piece to one that is 2D+2D. This change makes the game much easier to play.<br/><br/>The knight, on the other hand, rivals the queen in power, because it is the only piece in chess that already moves in 2 dimensions. On a 4x4x4x4 board, it can reach up to 2 dozen spots. The queen combines the moves of rook and bishop, and the king is a one-square queen in movement.<br/><br/>Pawns are the most changed, moving 1 square &quot;forward&quot; or &quot;sideways&quot; - 6 locations in all, and capturing as it moves. This allows 2 pawns to support each other, a useful feature on <br/>a 4D board.<br/><br/>The game is won by checkmate, which with the held king rule, can be achieved in the standard fashion, or it can be forced on a bare king by a king and 2 major pieces, from any legal positions on the board. The held king rule allows a king moving onto the other king's current &quot;level&quot; to pin the enemy king in that level. This solves a major problem in higher dimensional chess, that of mating the opponent on a 4D board, which has so many ways to escape.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From the Introduction<br/><br/>&quot;One of the regular debates that my wargaming colleagues and I seem to have is that of the role assumed by players during a wargame, and hence the level of detail that should be represented. Are we playing ships captains or fleet admirals? In general naval wargamers tend to assume the role of admirals whilst demanding a level of detail more appropriate to a 'game of captains.' For most periods this isn't too much of a problem as the numbers of ships tends to be relatively small, and there are fleet level rules with appropriate levels of abstraction for most periods. However, ancient naval warfare seems to be one period where all available rules operate at the ship level. Obviously this makes battles such as Salamis, with hundreds of ships involved, difficult to handle. I wanted a set of rules that could be used to recreate these enormous battles whilst placing the placing the players truly in the roles of admirals and squadron commanders. At this level the fate of the individual ships, other than those on which the commanders themselves are embarked, is unimportant. Hence, &quot;Greek Fire and Roman Fury&quot; was born.<br/><br/>&quot;The basis for these rules is a theory that the naval battles of antiquity were fought in a style that was essentially similar to typical land actions. Therefore, in these rules, the respective fleets are represented by squadrons rather than individual ships, which are maneuvered around the 'battlefield' in a similar manner to armies. After a few false starts I decided to use the ever popular and quite robust American Civil War Fire and Fury as the basis for the system, hence the name I finally selected for this article.&quot;<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>This miniatures rules set comes with information on what sorts of figures to use, and explains fleet composition, ship data (for the various sorts of ships that appear in the game), formations, sequence of play, morale, and a small number of charts<br/><br/>Rules set appears in Wargames Illustrated #187 (April 2003)<br/><br/>",

The resources required for the Second Punic War had previously forced the Romans to conclude a compromise with peace with Philip V of Macedon, but with the Carthaginian threat removed, it was payback time.<br/><br/>&quot;The neutral states of Rhodes and Pergamum provided an excuse for war, appealing to Rome for aid against Macedonian aggression, and the legions marched  towards Greece. Philip blocked the passes onto the peninsula at Epirus, but a consul named Titus Quincticus Flaminius managed to get a small force around the Macedonian flank. Philip, convinced that the whole Roman army was about to descend upon him, pulled back into Thessaly.<br/><br/>&quot;The Romans consolidated their hold on Epirus and voted Flaminius in for another term as consul and therefore military leader. After some intense diplomacy to establish which of the less dominant, minor powers of the region were allied to whom, Flaminius and Philip met at Cynoscephalae, named from the Greek for 'dog's head' after the name of a nearby ridge.<br/><br/>User Summary<br/><br/>Subtitled The Battle of Cynoscephalae 197 BC, this is a scenario for the Vis Bellica miniature wargame system.

Players can only mine each node once and the color they choose is then unavailable to the other players for that node. The gems are used to perform the three actions in the game: Red - mine, Blue - refill movement points, Yellow - reveal a new cavern.  The game ends when a player reaches the master chamber (center) and then exits the mine. Scoring consists of multiplying your least common gems by 3 and then adding that to your most common gems.<br/><br/>",

The game has no board but rather it is made up of a house that can be built up, it has three walls and an open side, and several wooden figures that can be positioned within the house. The first game supports listening and understanding of words and figures and the fine motor skills. Other games are simple memory games where the children try to remember which figures have been placed in the house.<br/><br/>",

However, not all paths head toward the top, some are rock-falls or dead-ends or lead in different directions.<br/><br/>Each player is a Billygoat, each of whom starts at the bottom of the mountain and must race their way up to the top.  The first Billygoat to reach the top is the winner.  However, as each player takes their turn, they change the paths leading to the top, to either help themselves or to hinder other players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The name of the game is DownsideUp. It is played and scored like rummy, but with a vengeful twist.  Players are dealt a hand of cards, with the goal being to rid yourself of all the cards in your hand. You can do this by playing cards to the table, in groups of three, either in sets (groups of cards with the game value from different suits) or in runs (three or more consecutive cards for one suit). Once a person lays down a group of cards, other players -- including the player who played the original set -- can now &quot;lay off&quot; cards to that group.<br/><br/>The unique components of this game are:<br/><br/>1.    Negative Cards - When you think your opponent has amassed too many points and is about to win the game, take revenge and play your negative cards to take points away for your opponent.<br/><br/>2.    Discarding your card Downsideup - If you have been watching which cards your opponent is collecting and you think your discard is going to help them, then play your discard &ldquo;Downsideup&rdquo; to keep your opponent from seeing that card, but remember where you put it so you can play it again later.<br/><br/>3.    Wild Cards - When your opponent lays down the card you have been waiting for to complete their run or set of card, use a wild card instead to play those cards to score points.<br/><br/>",

The exact circumstances and names have been changed to protect the guilty.<br/><br/>This game portrays the fauna of the District of Chaos and the institutions of its home rule government in realistic situations. Some parts of this game may be unsuitable for the politically naive.<br/><br/>Home Rulette is a political parody game themed on political corruption. In the game, players move their pieces along the path based on dice rolls.  Other players can impede movement through card-play.  Cards are gained by landing on spaces.  The first player to reach the end space is the winner.<br/><br/>&ldquo;Home Rulette takes place in the District of Chaos, a make believe capitol city of a world super power.  The game is totally fictional.  Obviously nothing so ridiculous as the characters, events or institutions contained in this game could exist in the real world.This make-believe capital city had been created by the country&rsquo;s Founding Fathers as a neutral place, free from local political funny-business, where people could safely go and conduct the nation&rsquo;s business. &lt;p&gt;However, this concept had one fatal flaw:  it worked, and as we all know, its standard government policy to try and fix things that aren&rsquo;t broken. As with any congressional action, many interest groups had to be satisfied.  One of these groups was the Humor Lobby.  If improvements had to be made, they should be funny.  Congress thought long and hard on what could be done to generate the most amount of laughter over the longest period of time.  Then the idea came to them.  Why not take the capital city which belongs to all of the country&rsquo;s citizens, and hand it over to a few local people who tried to burn it down in the 1960&rsquo;s&rdquo;.  At this suggestion smiles broke out on the Congressmen&rsquo;s faces as the potential for a  massive comic effect rolled through their minds. Then like drunk Olympian gods who decided to reach down from the heavens and play some tricks on some unfortunate mortals, they passed a&hellip;..bill. The results were as anticipated.  The &lsquo;wheeling, dealing and stealing&rsquo; which occurred as a result of this act kept the city and the country laughing for years.  The District of Chaos lurched from misadventure, to atrocity, to debacle, and then back again, as the inmates played government.  To quote his excellency Mayor-For-Life Marion Larry at his third coronation, &ldquo;The government can give people the change, &hellip;but it&rsquo;s up to the individuals to take advantage.&rdquo; This game gives you, the ordinary citizen, the chance to &ldquo;take advantage.&rdquo;  What happens when a coalition of welfare entrepreneurs, black supremacists, radical homosexuals &amp; common criminals take over the local government of the national capital city of a modern superpower? <br/>Wheel, Deal &amp; Steal<br/>Bash Chinks<br/>Blackmail Opponents<br/>Spread a fatal social disease<br/>Flim-flam the Feds<br/>Harass Honkeys<br/>Come Alive, Dis Ain&rsquo;t no jive Screw a Honky, Vote De Donkey<br/><br/>",

Two not-so-civil engineers attempt to build a thruway across the landscape while his or her opponent contests the right of way.<br/><br/>The game of Thruway requires the following components:<br/><br/><br/>        120 road section tiles; 60 gray concrete tiles and 60 black asphalt tiles.<br/>        One 11 x 11 square landscape game board with 121 parcels of land cells.<br/><br/><br/>The landscape game board is empty at the beginning of the game.<br/><br/>The concrete player tries to connect the east and west borders. The asphalt player tries to connect the north and south borders.<br/><br/>The concrete player plays first. Then on the asphalt player's first turn only, if he or she feels the concrete player has too much advantage from the placement of the first two concrete tiles, the asphalt player may opt to trade tiles and roles. The asphalt player becomes the concrete player and vice versa.  Whether or not roles are reversed, the asphalt player then takes a turn. Player turns then alternate for the rest of the game. Players may not pass a turn unless they have no legal move. Consecutive passes can never occur.<br/><br/>During a turn, an engineer may do any one of the following three actions:<br/>1.    Pave a road without replacement,<br/>2.    Pave a road with replacement, or <br/>3.    Resolve a crossroads dispute by swapping tiles.<br/><br/>To pave a road without replacement, a player places two of his or her road sections on two horizontally or vertically adjacent empty parcels of land.<br/><br/>To pave a road with replacement, a player places two of his or her road sections on two horizontally or vertically adjacent parcels of land, where one parcel is empty and the other cell contains an opponent's road section.  The replaced road section is recycled to its owner's reserve.<br/><br/>When a 2 x 2 square of land parcels is occupied by four road sections where asphalt and concrete roads occupy the two diagonals, this is called a crossroads dispute.<br/><br/>Crossroads Disputes<br/>ox    <br/>xo or<br/><br/>xo<br/>ox<br/><br/>A player may resolve a crossroads dispute in either of two ways:<br/>1.    by swapping any asphalt and concrete road sections along an edge of the 2 x 2 square, or,<br/>2.    if possible, by paving with replacement.<br/><br/>When swapping is used to resolve the dispute, only one swap per player turn is allowed. New crossroad disputes may arise due to the resolution of a dispute. In this case, the resolution of the newly formed dispute(s) may not immediately recreate the first dispute. This restriction, which prevents position repetition, applies only to your opponent's immediate response. On later player turns, the resolution can be reversed by either player.<br/>      <br/>A road section is indestructible, only if, all its adjacent north, south, east and west land parcels (that exist on the game board) have been paved by either player and it is not part of a crossroads dispute.<br/><br/>Goal: The first civil engineer to pave a thruway (connected path of horizontally and/or vertically adjacent indestructible road sections) connecting their two sides of the landscape wins the game.<br/><br/>",

In the fall of 1942, the very experienced German army was pushing further into the Soviet Union despite the serious setback inflicted on it by the Soviet winter offensive in December 1941. The Germans were now fighting a rebuilding Soviet army composed of raw recruits and some veteran units that had survived, and learned from, the battlefield disasters suffered by the Russians in 1941.<br/><br/>The German Sixth Army approached the outskirts of Stalingrad in September 1942 a little over two months into its summer offensive. Although his bombers had destroyed the city's industrial and transportation capacity in August, Hitler ordered the capture of Stalin's city. In Objective: Stalingrad, the German player starts with only sixteen regiments to accomplish this mission. The means to German victory is in the ground-attack Stukas and independent battalions of artillery, combat engineers, anti-aircraft (flak), and assault guns (StuGs) that can be attached to the regiments to devise the best tactical mix of forces to conquer Stalin's city.<br/><br/>While the German regiments were steadily reduced in strength and exhausted to impotence, dozens of untested, conscript Soviet rifle regiments and brigades were obliterated in the house-to-house fighting. Cards will provide crucial influential factors such as snipers, leader initiative, mine dogs, armored trains, and river flotilla warships.<br/><br/>In Objective: Stalingrad the German player commands up to twenty regiments of infantry, including panzer grenadier infantry, along with numerous independent units. There are four scenarios representing each of the major attacks launched by the Germans between 13 September and 11 November. There is also a multi-player campaign game. The smaller scenarios are designed to be played in three to four hours. (For a different approach, see Stalingrad: Verdun on the Volga. In VoV the German player can refight the four major historical attacks using up to nine primary maneuver units &ndash; divisions &ndash; at an operational level. The same scenario at that level can be finished in one to two hours.)<br/><br/>Objective: Stalingrad is about tactical choices for both the German and Soviet players. If you never had time to play Dana Lombardy's tactical company-level &quot;monster&quot; game Streets of Stalingrad, OS enables you to refight one of the most important battles of World War II in far less time.<br/><br/>",

Great Northern War is a Card Driven game focusing on the events of the war between Sweden, led by young king Karl XII and coalition of her enemies: Russia (led by Pyotr, later known as Peter the Great) Saxony (led by Augustus der Starke - the Strong) and Denmark (led by Frederik IVth). The war has also spread to initially neutral Poland, which became a battleground for involved powers.<br/><br/>In history, the Coalition has lost three major battles in the first year of the war. But the war continued, even despite early Danish withdrawal and Saxon surrender, which followed six years later. Carolus, who was also able to put his own king on Polish throne in the meantime, faced his last active enemy - Russia. His failed attempt at taking Moscow became the pivotal event and a milestone in Northern European history.<br/><br/>Players will be able to recreate those events or find their own alternative strategies to win the Great Northern War themselves.<br/><br/>The game is currently in development, first bits will be hopefully shown at Essen Spiel 2010.<br/><br/>",

An 18-inch octagonal plastic tray cradles eight sets of numbered Bingo cards, while small wells beside each hold plastic chips for covering the numbers on the cards. In the center of the tray, a spinning roulette-style wheel catches a steel ball in a lettered, numbered space when it stops--telling players what numbers to cover in their race to get five in a row. For younger players who are just learning to read double-digit numbers, it's good reinforcement; but, it's also fun for adults who usually can't sit through a &quot;kid's&quot; game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Oak Island, Nova Scotia, 1900<br/><br/>In 1795, Daniel McGinnis found a 10-foot circular indentation in the ground, in the centre of a man-made clearing. A large branch (and some say the remains of a pulley) hung directly above the pit. He recruited friends and, armed with shovels, they began to dig. They found a solid floor of oak-logs every 10 feet for a considerable depth. Sea-water floodied the pit and prevented them from digging further. What still lies buried over 100 feet below the surface depends on who you ask: Captain Kidd&rsquo;s treasure, Incan gold, Shakespeare&rsquo;s lost manuscripts, the Holy Grail, or perhaps nothing at all.<br/><br/>Over the years more men brought their ingenuity to bear on the problem, but failed. The failures were due to lack of modern machinery and ignorance; each excavation being stopped by water and lack of funds. A new century brings new technology and every hope that the mystery of Oak Island will soon finally be put to rest.<br/><br/>Oak Island is a board game for 3-5 players attempting to get to the bottom of the mysterious treasure pit on Oak Island. The amateur treasure hunters bring their resources to bear on the problem of excavating the pit, and compete with each other to publish their findings and theories using an innovative scoring system.<br/><br/>Players take turns picking up a row or column of resource cards from the card display. Action cards set in the display are triggered when a player picks it up. Machinery cards in the display do not refresh until the next round. A round ends when a player picks up the Treasure Trove License card, triggering an excavation.<br/><br/>The Money Pit consists of consecutive tiles that are revealed as they are excavated jointly by the players. In order to excavate a tile, the symbols shown on it must be matched on resource cards invested secretly and simultaneously by the players. Each resource card has an abstract monetary value ($, $$, or $$$); the players are ranked in order of investment, with the one who invested least playing first in the next round. The player who invested most gets first pick of the assets (clues, machinery, and victory points) collected by the venture.<br/><br/>Another source of VPs are the theories a player can publish. A theory consists of two or more clues joined together. A complete theory is any size rectangle (2xY) while a partial theory is any other assembly of clue pieces. Publishing a theory during the game consists of a player revealing one or more new clue pieces to form a new theory, or revealing one ore more new clue pieces and reinterpreting the clues of the same colour in an existing public theory (theirs or another players) in order to form a new theory. Clues that don&rsquo;t make it into the new theory cost the player points. The first clue played of any given colour are worth bonus points. Adjacent clues of the same colour within a theory are worth additional points. Complete theories earn a player 2 points per clue, excluding blank ones - incomplete ones earn a player 1 point per clue, including blank ones.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The Arian Controversy: A Game of Heresy and Hilarity is a light strategy game for two players.  Set in the early fourth century AD, one player takes on the role of Arius, attempting to gain support for his position that Jesus was not equal to God.  The opposing player takes the role of Alexander, bishop of Alexandria, and attempts to convince the world that Jesus was equal to God.  Players must move quickly around the board, spreading their message across Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.<br/><br/>On their turn, players draw two cards, each of which has a certain number of action points.  Using one card for action points, players move around the board and lay down support cubes.  The other card is stored away, to be used at the Council of Nicaea. <br/>Players debate at the Council of Nicaea with the cards that they've put away in order to gain further support for their position.  <br/>Once all cards are discarded, the player with the most support wins, and the opposing player is labeled a heretic.<br/>The Arian Controversy: A Game of Heresy and Hilarity brings all of the tension and name-calling of early Christian controversy to the comfort of your living room!<br/><br/>",

Whatever happens during the night of madness will never be spoken of ever again.<br/><br/>Players roll two dice to move themselves (one when carrying the barrel or being watched by the Abbot), plus an additional die to move the Abbot. The winner is the first monk who can carry the barrel into his cell after it has exited the cellar, brewery, kitchen and refectory.

This was the bustling time of the year when the Christmas workers needed to stop working for a moment and come together to discuss how Christmas was unraveling. The meeting attendees arrived as planned at Santa's home. They enjoyed appetizers and engaged in fun Christmas trivia questions while waiting for the meeting to begin. They had fun with an exciting game of 'What Christmas Thing am I' followed by a challenging game of Christmas Taboo. Mrs. Claus served a delicious dinner along with an entertaining Christmas Scramble challenge. The meeting was productive and the Christmas spirit was soaring high until to everyone's shock...a murder occurred! The Christmas characters all rallied together to figure out whodunit before this scandalous murder ruined Christmas! After everyone accused who they believed the murderer was...everyone came clean with their involvement in the crime and...the murderer confessed! While the group awaited the North Pole P.D. to arrive and arrest the accused, the group played a fun game of Christmas Charades. Overall, Christmas had its issues behind the scenes - but the nice boys and girls got their presents on Christmas morning according to plan.<br/><br/>home page: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.mymysteryparty.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.mymysteryparty.com/</a><br/><br/>",

There is no limit to the number of players.<br/><br/>GAME PLAY<br/>Each player starts with 6 cards in front of them face-down, representing 6 presents under 6 branches of their Christmas tree.  Each branch comes with a decoration card; these are defenses (e.g. Tinsel  barbed wire, Fairy lights  electric fence).  During their turn, players may play elf cards to form squads, then send the squads of elves to attack their neighbour, attempting to steal their presents.<br/><br/>Elf Defense uses the mechanics of a Magic: the Gathering circle of death to allow any number of players to join in, without significant downtime.<br/><br/>GOAL<br/>A player is eliminated when they have no presents remaining.

        "description": "&quot;Sometimes success has nothing to do with skill.&quot; - Anonymous (as quoted on the front of the box)<br/><br/>The object of the game is to move up the corporate ladder to the penthouse suite and become the Chief Executive Officer of the company.<br/><br/>This game is essentially a roll-and-move race, with event cards and money and other twists to make it a bit more interesting.  Instead of rolling the die to determine how far you move, the roll determines which deck of cards you draw from. The card determines your move, usually by giving you a choice.  For example, here is a card from the &quot;Personal Life&quot; deck: &quot;You suddenly get hit with two paternity suits.  Collect (2) enemychips and move back (3) or pay $2500.&quot;  Here's one from &quot;Connections&quot;: &quot;Your boss' spouse takes a liking to you at a company picnic.  Move up (2) or collect $500 and two friendchips.&quot;<br/><br/>Most turns you'll have to make a decision as to how to best balance your forward progress with your money, friends, and enemies.  Friend chips are awarded for various &quot;friendly&quot; events, and Enemy chips are earned for all the people you had to step on to raise yourself up.  Friendchips can be turned into $250 each if you can't otherwise make loan payments, or they can be used to move up one extra space.  Enemy chips can be bought off for $500, and you can't enter the CEO's office (and win the game) unless you have more friendchips than enemychips.  You also must enter the CEO's office by exact count, so it helps to have friendchips to adjust you movement as needed.<br/><br/>In addition, certain squares landed on indicate that a card from the &quot;Outside Influence&quot; deck is drawn.  These cards affect all players.  These events may refer to the department indicated on the board spaces.  The departments are &quot;Sales,&quot; &quot;Accounting,&quot; &quot;Data Processing,&quot; &quot;Manager,&quot; etc.  A card from the Outside Influence deck is: &quot;A new simulator increases the productivity of the Technical Department.  All technical staff move up (3).&quot;<br/><br/>",

Expandable to over 40 guests with the main game by adding additional guests to play with the 3 expandable characters.<br/><br/>MYSTERY SYNOPSIS:<br/>Three weeks ago, the cheery town of Sunnyville was hit hard with a devastating plague that turned the living into horrifying undead zombies. Once the H5N1 zombie virus spread and the zombie population dominated the living within Sunnyville, the zombies staged a revolt and took over the government. The Center for Disease Control, hearing of this epidemic centered in Sunnyville, quarantined the town and the U.S. Government threatened to 'wipe out' the population of zombies to prevent further spreading of this viral nightmare. But the citizens of the newly-formed Zombie Town weren't the stereotypical aggressive zombies portrayed in movies, television and comic books. The citizens of Zombie Town were simply dead and decomposing but still the same as before - upstanding citizens! But with one gruesome exception: the virus gave them an intense craving for living human flesh! Because a mandatory vaccine against the H5N1 zombie virus was given to the human population outside of Zombie Town and the epidemic ceased to exist, human rights activists caught wind of the situation in Sunnyville (aka: Zombie Town) and formed the Save a Zombie Alliance. Millions banded together across the country and persuaded the United States government to sign an unprecedented peace treaty with the zombies. Ashes, the self acclaimed Emperor of Zombie Town, represented the zombies and outlined the truce with the U.S. President. The major clause in the treaty was that zombies would not cross the borders of Zombie Town unless on an approved journey by the U.S. President and they would never hunt living humans for food outside of their borders. Because there were extensive warning signs posted for miles surrounding Zombie Town's borders, there was an addendum in favor of the zombies that if a living human ended up inside the borders of Zombie Town, they were 'fair game' to be hunted, captured and on a zombie's dinner table. Ashes set forth the laws of Zombie Town and the treaty was to be signed by both Ashes and the U.S. President within 24 hours. The citizens were happy to be at peace with the United States Government. Thankfully, they discovered they could sustain themselves by eating pumpkins but pumpkins didn&rsquo;t quite satisfy their appetite for living human flesh. Suppressing their cravings led to increasing irritability and with frustrations escalating in Zombie Town, Ashes knew s/he had to pump up the morale of the citizens. Leary of an impending civil unrest, s/he scheduled the Undead Festival which was a massive town-wide celebration with delicious pumpkin-inspired food, rockin' music and fun zombie games. And this is where the story begins...<br/><br/>",

The management of the Chamber of Screams decided to reward the employees with a mini-Halloween celebration held during normal business hours in the employee break room. The Haunted House typically shut down each night for a brief time period so the employees could get a break and straighten up their haunted scenes. It was rumored that management probably did this so the line of customers outside would build up and The Chamber of Screams would look twice as popular. Regardless of the reason for the break, the employees looked forward to the upcoming treat during their next shift at work. The Halloween Celebration kicked off without a hitch as the frightening cast members piled into the employee break area and enjoyed delicious creepy appetizers and eerie drinks while quizzing each other on challenging spooky trivia.

This is an extremely light-hearted and comical murder mystery for great family fun on Thanksgiving.<br/><br/>MYSTERY SYNOPSIS:<br/>Hannah Standish sent the announcements for her annual Thanksgiving feast to the Pilgrims of Plymouth Village and the Native Americans of the Wompang tribe. The day of the feast arrived and the hungry guests flocked to the Standish home with their hands full of tasty dishes to be shared by all. The guests quizzed each other with fun trivia while nibbling on delectable appetizers. To everyone's surprise, representatives from a neighboring flock of wild turkeys also arrived on the scene to befriend the Pilgrims and Native Americans in hopes to stop the growing tradition of roasting a turkey on Thanksgiving Day. The turkey representatives gave it their best shot and pleaded with the humans to make a switch of the traditional Thanksgiving feast to cow, pig or maybe even fish as the main course. After the humans listened to the wild turkey&rsquo;s pleas, they decided to give the turkeys 'temporary immunity' while they engaged in a fun game of 'What Thanksgiving Thing am I.' They continued with the challenging 'Football Mascot Challenge' before settling in for a nice Thanksgiving Dinner. But before they could dig into the Thanksgiving feast, a victim was discovered in the adjacent room! Murder on Thanksgiving?! Disastrous! The group rallied together to investigate whodunit before the murderer could get away! They took a quick break from the stress of the investigation and played some awesome games such as the 'Thanksgiving Scramble Challenge', 'Thanksgiving Bingo' and the hilarious 'So You Wanna Make a Turkey' challenge. Then, the guests one by one accused who they believed the murderer was and then to everyone's shock...the murderer confessed! The guests capped off the investigation with a hilarious game of 'Thanksgiving Charades' followed by a challenging 'Thanksgiving Word Hunt' game and then settled in for a delectable Thanksgiving feast! Overall it was most definitely a Thanksgiving that everyone will remember for years to come!<br/><br/>",

The players each start on a branch of the cross by laying out 6 checkers and one horsemen (these 7 pieces are their knights) in the squares of the grid of their branch and their king's space. A player's turn consists of (1)drawing a card, (2)dueling another player's knight (optional), (3)turning in any pairs of cards you may have for more knights, and (4) moving any one knight to either an adjacent space or any available green space on the board, one of which allows a player to draw an extra card on their turn.<br/><br/>When a player starts a duel with another player, they each select a card from their hand, and higher card wins (king is high).  Ties are draws and both cards are discarded.  Re-dueling is optional. The winner draws a card from the draw pile AND takes both cards used in the duel (placed in 'pair's pile'), and loser removes their knight from the board.<br/><br/>Certain spaces on the board have numbers on them which require the attacker to play a card of that value or higher, while the defender may play any card value. Jokers may be played at any time to steal a random card from an opponent's hand.<br/><br/>After dueling, if you have any pairs (from either your hand or your 'pair's pile' ) you may turn as many as you wish in for more knights which are then placed in any space adjacent to another of your own knights.<br/><br/>Your goal is to have your knights occupying all four king spaces on the board.  You must always occupy at least one king space on the board, but not necessarily the one you started with.  If a person loses a duel for their last king space, all of their knights are removed from the board, and their cards are given to the winner of the duel.<br/><br/>",

With mere days before Christmas Eve and piles of presents yet to construct, you must reign in old Willy's outrageous ideas and convince him to green light and produce your concepts to help save christmas.<br/><br/><br/>Santa's Workshop Disaster is a quick family holiday themed card game for 2-6 Players, the more the merrier!  It plays similar to Apples to Apples, using funny and disgusting combinations of IDEA and CONCEPT Cards, which together represent a finished present yet to be constructed. Taking turns playing the Head Elf, you draw an IDEA card and (reading aloud) present it on the table.  Helper Elves (the remaining players) then choose a CONCEPT card that they feel best matches the IDEA card.  Receiving the cards face down, the Head Elf then shuffles and (reading aloud) presents the CONCEPTS on the table.  Using ANY criteria, the Head Elf then chooses which Combination of IDEA and CONCEPT to green light and send to production - thus scoring one point towards the win for the player whose CONCEPT was chosen.  Roles then rotate around the table until there is a winner with the most CONCEPTS chosen (rules vary based on number of players).  <br/><br/><br/>Santa's Workshop Disaster is a Free Print and Play designed by Monster Make.108 Cards, all files provided in High Resolution, including Rules and Tuck Box.<br/><br/>Currently files can be found HERE.<br/><br/>It is a large file (240MB) consisting of 14 pages of 8.5x11 (Letter) Cards with 9 cards to a page.  It also contains 1 page of 8.5x11 PocketMod layout Rules, and 2 pages of 8.5x14 (Legal) Tuckbox layouts. <br/> The files will eventually be loaded into the Database, but for now can be found at the above link!<br/><br/>Included is alternate rules for 2 players with the addition of A,B,C cards and a version for young (3+ years) players.<br/><br/><br/>Thanks, hope you enjoy!!<br/>Stephen - Monster Make",

The game will involve dice-based combat, but will have multiple paths to victory for both the monsters and the humans, both fighting for different things.<br/><br/>One group will consist of six monsters: a cow; a crayfish; an asian carp; a gorilla; a bluegill; and two deep-tunnel sewer rats. The other group will consist of humans, plus humans with functions like workmen, fire fighters, police, nat'l guard, and some super-humans like Lara Croft and ninjas might appear during gameplay.<br/><br/>The game is driven foremost by the HO scale minis used in the game, and the plastic monsters. The toy value is what this &Uuml;ber-Ameritrash game is about.There will be multiple rule sets developed. Really, this game started with the toys, and a desire to improve an old game or two, while thematically morphing it into a game which featured downtown Milwaukee, WI USA.<br/><br/>At this point it's a prototype. The game is a homage to The Creature That Ate Sheboygan, borrows from Heorscape and Monsters Menace America, requires some D&amp;D features like THACO, and has lots of other options for tweaks and alt games.<br/><br/>The &quot;ha ha&quot; is deliberate in the name because of the twisted humor woven into the fabric of the game. The &quot;bronze fonz&quot; is on the map, and either side will get a bonus for either destroying it or simply rubbing it for good luck. Names for the creatures also have built-in humor:<br/><br/>Vince Gill: the bluegill who is also a Packer fan, but hates Milwaukeeans because of their fascination with the Friday Fish Fry. His desire is to crush restaurants which serve fish.<br/><br/>Son of Samson: the undead giant son of the most famous ex-resident of the Milwaukee Zoo, whose goal is to get to the top  of the Firstar/U.S. Bank tower and fling poo.<br/><br/>Carpie Diem: an asian carp, who seized headlines recently as the no.1 environmental enemy to Lake Michigan. He can jump across city blocks and smash things under his weight. Very easily distracted by the Ladybug Club, thinking they are asian lady beetles.<br/><br/>Holey Cow: a sympathizer with O'Leary's Chicago firestarter, this copycow is a Cubs fan and happens to breathe methane gas fires from her four stomachs, and out her nostrils. She's also capable of making massive cowpies which block city streets.<br/><br/>'Hood Ratz: a pair of residents from our failed Deep Tunnel system, these rodents are skaven mad *wink* and capable of chewing through even the five foot thick walls of the Fed Bldg. They're also attracted to hip-hop music.<br/><br/>Rebecca the Boiling Crayfish: (no relation to our new Lt. Governor of WI) she's looking for her crawdaddy in one of the restaurants that serve her brethren. The humans are in hot water this time.<br/><br/>The game narrative is such that an event has taken place that, combined with the deep tunnel sewer failure, has caused six local creatures to grow in size and terrorize Brewtown.<br/><br/>The Federal Bldg. is within the now quarantined section of Brewtown, and the goals of the monsters are many, but they have to achieve them before they are killed or the feds are able to call in the antidote. Meanwhile, the humans are to stay alive and kill monsters,while protecting buildings from fires, repairing blocked roads, and achieving other goals along the way.<br/><br/>There are several groups of humans:<br/><br/>Firefighters: complete with a new ladder truck, these six individuals have axes and hoses in hand *wink* to face any challenge.<br/><br/>Police: one car (Milwaukee police are grossly underfunded) and a handful of officers help with attacks, rescue civilians, and keep the peace among the surviving humans.<br/><br/>National Guard: these weekend warriors with five tanks were setting up for maneuvers downtown, ending in at the Veterans Memorial nearby when this hit. They've not got much live ammo with them for this reason, but they have plenty of rubber bullets of all sizes-and they look scary as hell. The can fly in one helicopter from General Mitchell Airport in a couple of rounds, and it will have the firepower they need, but the rest of the military is on furlough.<br/><br/>Municipal Construction: several men on a job site with a huge dump truck, a CAT backhoe, and two CAT scoopshovels. They're tough enough to fight the monsters on their own with their equipment and they're experts at &quot;catcalls&quot;.<br/><br/>Waste Management: one unmanned truck full of Milwaukee's finest refuse, abandoned.<br/><br/>Superhumans: activated at different times in the game when humans accomplish certain goals: a Lara Croft lookalike, with the guns to prove it; a ninja; two advanced swordplay students from the T'ai Chi Ch'uan center of Milwakee, and their leader Mike. Mike's wearing a Yoda costume he found at the Milwaukee Film office, and his mastery of push hands gives him the equivalent of the &quot;force push&quot;. He hopes the creatures watched the trilogy, and fear him...<br/><br/>The two collaborative groups struggle until the game ends for a variety of reasons. There are several paths of victory for either team.<br/><br/>",

In subsequent paragraphs, players receive instructions about how to proceed: they must make decisions about which way to go next, roll the die, or solve clues using the included playing cards (in the shape of various tools, such as a torch or a codebook). The more clues solved, the better chance of unraveling the final mystery.

        "description": "Hansel is too greedy and wants to eat all the cookies from the roof of the witch her house.  But he has to be carefull because the witch who is disguised as a pigeon will prevent him.<br/><br/>The board looks like a house with on top 3 places to put a card.  Shuffle the deck of cards and put three cards on these locations.  Then you put a pigeon figure on the roof in one of the three slots above a card.  There is also a Hansel figure, place this on the table.<br/><br/>At his turn a player may turn over a card from the deck.  If the card doesn't match the card under the pigeon nothing happens and the player may take the card.  The player can turn over as many cards as he wants.  If he wants to stop he can take all the cards that he has turned over.  But if he turns the same card  that is under the pigeon then the player has to make the sound of a pigeon and take the pigeon figure from the roof to prevent the witch from coming down.  At the same time each other player may try to take the hansel figure.  The first person who does this gets the first card of the open pile, and all the cards go to a discard pile.  So the player who turned the cards lost all his cards (except maybe one).  The witch is then put in a slot on the roof again.<br/><br/>A player that took Hansel by mistake has to give in a card he won in a previous round.<br/><br/>When the drawing deck is empty the game stops.  The player with the most cards wins the game.<br/><br/>",

This is so as to combine the forced progression of diagonal checkers with the richness of the orthogonal game.<br/><br/>Object: Capture all your opponent's pieces (&quot;Checkers&quot; or &quot;Kings&quot;) by jumping over them, or stalemate the opponent so he has no moves.<br/><br/>Checkers can move diagonally forward, by sliding to an adjacent empty square or by jumping either left, right, or forward over an enemy piece to a vacant square on the other side. Jumping over a piece captures it, but you may not jump diagonally. Capturing is mandatory, and you must keep jumping and capturing as long as it is possible, taking the maximum number of pieces.<br/><br/>The King is a long range piece and can slide diagonally in any direction or jump left, right, up or down over any opponent piece to any free square. When your Checker stops on the other end of the board, it becomes a King and can then also move backwards. If it merely visits a promotion square during a series capture moves, then it does not promote.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Several versions of the battle have been produced. Each has been contrived to show a historic resolution, fun for the English player, depressing for the French. Azincourt (French spelling) is a unique approach. The French might have had more coordinated leadership. They might not have been so intent on an easy victory, and as a result been so careless. They might have taken advantage of the vulnerable English advance. They might have waited for the English to wear themselves out crossing the muddy field and allowed Henry to make the first attack. They might have employed their crossbows to better effect. Had they better control of their troops, crowded conditions would not have reduced combat effectiveness. Finally, had they considered avenues for retreating units, disruption of fresh units would not been such a problem.<br/><br/>In Azincourt I address a number of these what-ifs but, moreover, I offer players the unique mechanic of commanding one flank of each opposing army. In effect players play BOTH the French AND the British. It works out much better than you would expect. Since the English line is necessarily pretty static, there is little problem in coordinating an English defense while splitting command of the French in the face of the enemy mirrors the historically poor French command.<br/><br/>Azincourt is a card assisted, counter and hex game utilizing large colorful counters and a variety of aids that allows for a key battle component which other versions neglect to emphasize - the capture of nobles for ransom. Integral to Azincourt play is the capture of these nobles, English and French (including King Henry), of varying value. Ah and then there are the complications that such nobles bring. Wounded nobles become easy targets. Captured nobles make targets of their captors. Then there are Henry's terrible archers ... who WILL run out of arrows, and then what? To add to the game's variety is a random set-up and reinforcemnt schedule that toys with a number of possible historical possibilities.<br/><br/>Playtesting has been a blast so far but continues so no publisher has yet committed. Still, all in good time...<br/><br/>",

If they are abused, mis-managed or ignored; we on land will be worse off for our neglect of this wonderful planet.<br/><br/>Sea Ranger can teach or remind us all of our place in this world; how we use the oceans and waterways; the balance of life and our needs; raise our awareness of how mankind neglects or abuses these incredible places.<br/><br/>Within, on and around our oceans and rivers, hide a multitude of life, living in a state of balance, growing and evolving.  Mankind is upsetting this balance to dangerous levels.<br/><br/>Learn, have fun with friends and family, share this knowledge and make a difference in this world.<br/><br/>What is Sea Ranger?<br/><br/>Sea Ranger is a board game designed to educate and entertain 2-6 players about the amazing and diverse wildlife that inhabits the oceans and waterways creating a giant circle of life.  We can also learn how mankind uses and abuses this incredible resource we all share.<br/><br/>Sea Ranger is a multi-facetted game.  Not only are the players learning about the aquatic environment, they are also learning about themselves.  Players learn many qualities of character that are required to either win or prevent collective loss among the players.  They share the responsibilities, successes and benefits.<br/><br/>Players learn:;<br/><br/>To share and care for resources.<br/><br/>Collective and individual responsibility.<br/><br/>Manage resources.<br/><br/>To maintain a balance of life and needs.<br/><br/>Value life in all forms as part of the wealth of this world.<br/><br/>Respect each players participation and support.<br/><br/>The best part is that it is fun doing this.<br/><br/>Who Can Play?<br/><br/>The game is aimed at children from 8 years and over and adults.  Children will require guidance to assemble.<br/><br/>Children quickly master the rules.<br/><br/>So how does it all work?<br/><br/>The game gives players knowledge and choices.  Players can easily discern what feels right or is the right thing to do.  We all know within our hearts what is right and good, even if we don't know the answer.<br/><br/>The game uses a special board and tokens.  You print out the board and pieces on your colour printer, then cut and assemble the components.  To make them last longer or be more durable you may mount them on card or laminate the pieces.  Teach the children skills as they read instructions and learn to cut out the pieces.<br/><br/>The game is directed by a special card deck which will present players with a series of events and choices.  The players must decide how they will resolve these, sometimes this may require teamwork and sharing.  There are many different strategies you can use to win, some can be very quick, others slower.<br/><br/>Part of the game revolves around maintaining the circle of life, ensuring a balance of species to enable life to continue.  Each creature is part of that circle and has a unique role to play.<br/><br/>Players must then try and balance mankind's intervention and damage to the seas and waterways.  It is a careful juggling act; players individually cannot hope to keep the balance so you need to play cooperatively.<br/><br/>What Do I Get?<br/><br/>Sea Ranger is 26-page colour PDF plus a small rules booklet.   The game requires you to print 16-pages to create the board, cards &amp; tokens.  Included is the deluxe card set giving you the choice of finish.  Where possible we have tried to minimise the graphical content to save ink.  Ideally the major components are printed on card.  Some simple assembly is required.<br/><br/>(Edutainment Games, <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.edutainment-games.com\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">www.edutainment-games.com</a>)<br/><br/>",

To play a NEW game there is the possibility to change the picture-plates underneath, fitting the colors, around the holes in the corners, to the same colors of the pegs.  There are two plates, printed on both sides, that give four different possibilities.  To add even more playing possibilities, there are 5 papers included for drawing, or gluing pictures or photos.  <br/>To practice before playing memo, you can start with a simple game, where you look for each pair.

        "description": "&quot;It's War!! ...but in a nice way.&quot;<br/><br/>Good: the Battle is a miniatures based combat skirmish game, in which you take the role of a character or characters and attempt to defeat your opponents by doing good and inflicting bad upon them. The core game, designed by us at Project Good is the game of Good: the Battle. The uniqueness of Good: The Battle is it's ability to use any genre, any miniatures, anywhere, anything else...? Yes there is, but it's all Good...<br/><br/>Unlike the heavily stat-based games that you see everywhere nowadays, Good: the battle turns these statistics  into two basic attributes; Good and bad. Obviously the better you are at things (shooting, close combat, healing, etc.) the longer you will survive in this world, but everyone has a limit of how much Good they can do. Nasty things like damage, curses, etc can only be described as Bad things, but sometimes a bit of bad is exactly what is needed.<br/><br/>There are thousands, probably hundreds of thousands, of character miniature manufacturers out there; and every single one of these can be used in Good: the Battle - regardless of scale, setting, period, race, etc. Good: the Battle uses the actual miniature to give you benefits in the game. For example; a miniature equipped with swords will be better in close combat, than somebody with none. A miniature carrying a rocket launcher will obviously do more damage if it shoots you in the head. Huge dragons will have more hit points, and mice will have less. But this doesn't mean a one-armed dwarf mute who's only weapon is a bag full of dead hamsters won't be able to put up a fight...<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game features a circular metal lithographed playing board, which is very similar to a metal tray.  The board has a &quot;gun&quot; at the bottom which shoots metal balls at metal airplanes which are placed at the 4 predetermined positions near the top half of the board.  A pullstring is wrapped around the spinner and then it is pulled like a top.  The metal balls are then loaded into the left side of the &quot;gun&quot; and the spinning mechanism &quot;fires&quot; the balls out the other side of the gun in rapid fire.  The metal airplanes have a ball-bearing on the underside of the planes that allows them to rest in the holes near the top of the board.  When a fired shot hits the airplane it is dislodged from its position and it falls toward the bottom of the playing area, thus crashing into the ground.   The player then scores points based on which airplanes are shot down.  Each player gets a set number of &quot;shots&quot; and the player with the most points after all players have taken their shots wins the game.  <br/>This game is made by McDowell Mfg. and was manufactured around the 1930's.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a game from India published for the purpose of educating children in the teachings of the guru Gnani Purush Shri Ambalal Muljibhai Patel, also known as Dada Bhagwan. It consists of two separate boardgames: &quot;Dada's World&quot;, which teaches about how to behave apropriately in given situations and answer questions about the guru's teachings; and &quot;Guess, Who Am I?&quot;, which focuses on identifying role models.<br/><br/>Game 1 (Dada's World) - Players roll a die and move along a track which represents their journey through Dada's World, collecting rectangular plastic &quot;coins&quot; with a variety of point values. <br/>Landing on marked spaces along the track can either add points (Helped Poor Person: 100), subtract points (Killed a cockroach: -150), provide the opportunity to answer questions about Dada's teachings to earn points (Dadai Dhamaka), lose turns, take extra turns, go back to Home, and other similar effects. At certain points on the track, players have the opportunity to pay points to take a shorter route.<br/>The winner is the first player to make a complete circuit of the track and return to the start space with 1500 points or more. Players who complete the track with fewer than 1500 points must go back to an earlier square and try to accumulate more points.<br/><br/>Game 2 (Guess, Who Am I?) - Players roll a die and move along a track collecting pieces of three separate puzzles. Most of the spaces on the board are marked with a statement associated with one of the three &quot;role models&quot; - Parents, Dadashri and Humanity. When landing on a space on the board, players must identify which role model is associated with the statement on that space (example: Space #17 &quot;We should bow down to them every day&quot; is associated with Parents). Correctly identifying the role model allows the player to take the puzzle piece associated with that space. <br/>Other spaces give the player a free random puzzle piece, allow the player to take a piece from another player, or cause the player to lose a turn. Players who reach the end of the track without winning the game move back to Start and continue to collect puzzle pieces.<br/>To win, a player must collect all 12 pieces of one of the three puzzles. He may then assemble the puzzle to see a picture representing one of the role models, then flip the pieces over to reveal a message.<br/><br/>From the rule booklet:<br/><br/>Hello kids!!!<br/><br/>Time to enter DADA'S WORLD filled with excitement, fun &amp; learn.....<br/><br/>This 2-in-1 Game Pack offer dual knowledge and fun, Get the tracks right from 'Home' to 'Simandhar City' and back 'Home' in Game 1. If you follow the rule you are IN, if you refrain then you commit a SIN.<br/><br/>Also recognize the ROLE MODELS of your life by learning their virtues and identifying them in Game 2. Abount Parents, Dadashri and humanity is what we get to learn.<br/><br/>Wow! So much to do, so much to learn, so little time we want more fun, then grab on this Game Pack 2-in-1.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Grid Snakes is a quick-playing game with some real-world dexterity elements for two, four, or six players (with variant rules for three, five, and seven to twelve players). You&rsquo;re a digital snake, trapped in an arena with several other snakes. As you move, you leave body segments behind you. Your goal is to eliminate your opponents by forcing your opponents to crash into the edge of the board or and section of any other player.<br/><br/>Play is simultaneous (so there's no down time) and proceeds through the following phases: plan, challenge, resolve.  During planning, you have a just a handful seconds to pick a direction and a speed for your snake. When all instructions are revealed, any player may spend a token to challenge another player.  If you're challenged, you have to flick a token onto a chart; where it lands dictates your speed for the turn.  During resolution, you move the snakes, add body segments, and check for collisions.<br/><br/>Grid Snakes uses a large and a small custom board, several small custom decks of cards (eight cards each), some nickels or quarters, and a lot of colored glass beads (or other small tokens). The rules and cards are available at: <a target='_blank' href=\"http://www.invisible-city.com/file_download/165/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer noopener\">http://www.invisible-city.com/file_download/165/</a><br/><br/>Grid Snakes has fairly simple rules, but requires quick decision making and planning. Grid Snakes is appropriate for ages 12 and up. If you eliminate the timer, you could probably play this game with slightly younger children. If you allow multiple attempts on reflex challenges, you could go even younger. A four-player game takes 30 minutes or fewer to play. A six-player game takes 40 minutes or fewer.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Necromantic acolytes are dueling in a deserted graveyard to become the most powerful Necromancer! This is achieved by collecting arcane tomes of power &amp; the chest of ultimate secrets, or by destroying your enemies minions with devastating spells and hordes of undead monsters.<br/><br/>This game has been taken to several war gaming conventions in the uK where it achieved Best Participation game at Warfare (Reading 2010)<br/><br/>The games consists of 4 players each representing a Necromancer in charge of an undead horde. To begin with eaxh player has 3 ghouls, these are; fast, good at searching but weak in combat. During each turn the players will raise a skeleton and a zombie to supplement their force. So more figures will enter play as the game progresses. The turn order is determined randomly by pulling stones from a bag. There are six stones, one for each player and the other two represent the resurrection of skeleton &amp; zombie. When a players stone is drawn, they are allowed to move all their figures. No diagonal movement is allowed, nor are you allowed to enter a space occupied by other players pieces, and finally there's a stcking limit of 4 figures per area. After moving any figures against to an enemy must fight (this is compulsory), otherwise they may search for artifacts. Specially prepared dice are used for both searching &amp; combat. These dice have the following faces; 2 x swords, 1 x shield, 2 x eye and 1 x swirl. During searching a number of dice are rolled, if any show the 'eye' the item has been found and will need to be carried back to the Necromancer in order to be used or scored. In combat, both players roll their respective dice, lokking for swords or shields. Basically a shield will negate a sword, any any excess swords on either side will kill a minion each. Spells can be played to influence the outcome of a battle ie 'Battle rage' - All swirls count as swords, thereby increasing your chance of killing your opponents figures.<br/><br/>zombies are slow, not good in searching but the best fighters, skeletons are average across the board. The Necromancer himself, is very good at searching, but otherwise similar to a skeleton.Points are awarded for kills and for collecting items. The first player to acquire 25 points wins. Sets of gems are worth more than singles, scrolls give you another spell but are not worth any points, relics are worth 2 points, the chest is 4 (this is placed in the centre of the board) and potions are worth 1 but can be used in combat to roll an extra die. Kills are worth 2 points each, however the Necromancer is immortal so each wound he takes is worth 2.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This educational game shows the consequences of lobbying for fair trade relations with third world producers. It is used in schools of the German state of Rheinland-Pfalz, with the goal of inspiring students to put pressure on their communities to buy fair trade goods. <br/>Up to five players represent importers of third world goods (bananas, stones, coffee, tea and cotton clothes), trying to be the one with the greatest profit who doesn't get caught either overcharging the buyers or inhumanly exploiting the producers. The board has five tracks, one for each product (for the sake of the game, they all have the same price). On the track, there are three markers: The lowest is the price that the producers get; the middle one represents the overall cost including shipping costs, the third one the price that a municipality buys the goods for (the distance between the latter two is the profit margin). The mechanism is a simple &quot;play one card, draw one card&quot;. The cards have events printed on them, with each event either influencing the own track (with some choices to make) or that of another player. There are also hidden cards which can be played face-down to another player's track. These are revealed at the end of the game and influence the the maximum prize a municipality will pay and the maximum abuse of producers it will tolerate. A player who exceeds either of these levels is out of the game; the remaining player with the highest profit margin is the winner.<br/>The game has some push your luck element (you can make a rough guess about the tolerable levels from the number of cards played against you) and is embedded in a curricular project in the schools of the state. <br/>It is not for sale nor does it come in a box. 12 copies were hand-made by Reinhold Wittig, of which 10 copies will be used in schools beginning in 2011.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Designed for the 2010 Christmas Print and Play Game Design Contest, Jingle Jangle is a domino-like placement game which scores points for arranging tiles into the appropriate patterns.<br/><br/>Jingle Jangle uses a special set of 30 tiles with two bells on them called jangles. The game can be played by two, three or four players and the size of the hand varies with the number of players.<br/>&bull; Two players get 14 jangles each, with two jangles left over.<br/>&bull; Three players get 9 jangles each, with three jangles left over.<br/>&bull; Four players get 7 jangles each, with two jangles left over.<br/>In the case of three left over jangles, one is put away out of the game and not exposed, to leave two jangles in the starter. The starter is the pair of left over jangles. These are turned face up and put side by side to make a square in the middle of the table.<br/><br/>Jangles are placed on the table, vertically or horizontally, played out from the starter square. The idea is to build a &ldquo;crossword puzzle&rdquo; grid of repeated color patterns in the rows and columns.<br/><br/>Any set of two or more adjacent jangles ending in a row or column is called a group. The jangles must be played so that the bells in each group form a (repeating) pattern. The possible patterns are:<br/><br/>&bull; a single color repeated, example: red, red, red or<br/>&bull; two colors alternating, example: red, blue, red, blue, red, blue or<br/>&bull; three colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow, red, blue, yellow or<br/>&bull; four colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, red, blue, yellow, green or<br/>&bull; or all five colors in a repeating cycle, example: red, blue, yellow, green, purple, red, blue, yellow, green, purple<br/>As soon as a group has a repeated color in it, or contains all five colors, the pattern for that group is fixed, and future jangles that extend the group must conform to the established pattern. As the layout grows, it is possible for a row or column to contain two or more groups, separated by spaces.<br/><br/>Each jangle must be placed so that it correctly extends two or more groups, but you are not allowed to create a set of four jangles side by side in the layout, touching along their long sides.<br/><br/>If a player thinks he cannot play, he exposes his hand. The other players can then (if they wish) point out any plays he might not have seen. In this case the player must play a tile. If more than one possible play is pointed out, the player has the option of picking the one he likes. If no play is pointed out, then the player scores zero and places no jangle. He is not out of the game, but has to wait for his next turn to see if he can then find a play.<br/><br/>The game ends one of two ways: 1) When one player places all his jangles. The other players who started after him get to place one more jangle, however. 2) When no player can place a jangle.<br/><br/>Scores are counted and added as the jangles are placed. Each bell on a jangle is worth 5 points, The score is the product of the new lengths of all extended groups. If the jangle used to extend the group is a double, then the score is also doubled.<br/><br/>All players lose points for the jangles remaining in their hands when the game is ended. Doubles are -5 points and all other jangles are -25 points.<br/><br/>",

When you see the cards you need, you're in luck - SHAKE'M &amp; TAKE'M. But watch it! Your opponent might be luckier. Make another challenge. Shake 'm and OOPS! You lost. Next player.<br/><br/>There's plenty of action and risk when you SHAKE'M &amp; TAKE'M. Cards go from player to player, back and forth. Dice roll with each challenge. And wild cards add to the fun as part of the strategy.<br/><br/>Players are attempting to acquire a number of sets of 4 cards each by challenging other players to a dice roll off. Players set down their hands face up in front of everyone. On your turn, you may challenge a player for some of their cards. You both roll a die and the higher roll wins the cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cheddar Challenge is an abstract game of strategy and skill similar to Chess. Imagine simplified Klingon Chess. Each player has three categories of wedges. Sharp Cheddar, Medium Cheddar and Mild Cheddar. There are specific sizes, numbers of, movements and strengths for each category of wedge. Each category of piece has unique movement and strength. (For example the Mild Cheddar has the greatest number of pieces.) The goal of the game is to win by capturing all wedges comprising one of your opponent's three categories of cheddar. A player will lose if they lose one of their categories. The game is played on a rhombus shaped game board made up of triangluar cells. The theme is fun because its based on cheese and the shapes of cheese wedges. And its much easier to learn and less complicated than Chess or Klingon Chess and can be a great introduction to those games later on.<br/><br/>",

You can use your divine powers to quickly gain followers or deviously attack your competing religions. Priests, Zealots, Prophets, and Avatars are your pawns of strategic influence in a developing city which you must control.<br/><br/>The game board consists of 9 tiles that are randomly placed at the beginning of the game to represent an ancient city. Each tile consists of a 36 square grid that depicts various special locations within the city. Players start by controlling a single temple that allows them to train either Priests or Zealots. Priests can preach to gain followers based on the population of each spot on the game board; however, they are vulnerable to be assassinated by an opponent's Zealot. Priests can also establish new temples throughout the city, which can also be desecrated and destroyed by an opponent's Zealot. Unit movement is dictated by multiple dice rolls equal to the number of temples you control.<br/><br/>Players can use divinity cards from their hand to change the outcome of certain scenarios. More powerful units like Prophets and Avatars can only be created by using specific divinity cards. By taking control of special spaces on the board players can also receive additional bonuses.<br/><br/>To win the game players must carefully choose a win condition to work towards. A player wins the game if they are the first to 1) amass 100 follower tokens or 2) capture all 4 tower spaces or 3) be the only remaining player with a temple.<br/><br/>",

As custom have it you are not allowed to be in the monastery during the three days of voting. You are therefore located in a small camp outside with eight novices to help you. After the election you are going to enter the monastery and receive the monks&rsquo; decision. However, you are both very proud so you&rsquo;ve made a private agreement. During the days of voting you will send in your novices in secret to find out what the general opinion is on some of the 5 major issues in the monastery. Before the voting begins you both write down your opinion on each issue on a scroll and seal it safely away. When the third day arrives you will open the scrolls and compare your scroll with the general opinion in the monastery that you&rsquo;ve gathered from your novices. The one you think will win the election will enter the monastery and win the game.

        "description": "This is an economic simulation game where each player is the manager of a multinational company. These companies produce and sell the same good (but in different styles and qualities) in 4 different regions (North/South America, Europe, Asia). Each game year the players will need to make important investment decisions (such as constructing or shutting down shops/factories worldwide, buying/selling shares, paying dividends), select a viable and efficient production plan, try to fulfill it and finally convert their production to sales. Also, they will have to look at the competition and through research try to push their efficiency even further. Simultaneously, local providers will also offer their products and &quot;steal&quot; a share of the market.<br/><br/>As in reality selling does not come easily. Each region will have a specific demand for the homogenous good (but in different quantities and styles) and a specific preference for quality and style. Considering these factors and of course the price, players will try to manipulate the markets. Demand is not totally known, however there is always a way to know better and possibly &quot;change&quot; the knowledge of the competitors at the last moment. Difficult decisions and a bit of luck will define the actual sales.<br/><br/>Players try to make profits not only for the money but also for their share price. Otherwise they will have to pay dividends if they want to keep the share price from declining. Loans are limited, costly and should not be taken lightly.<br/><br/>Scoring is unlocked by profitability and is measured by share price. Thankfully, no ownership changes are taking place in this game (it is assumed that the initial number of shares represent less than 50% of the company).<br/><br/>",

Start each game on spot of Ground Plan colored GREEN, which is nearest the starting location indicated for that particular game...And move toward goal on circular stepping stones printed on Ground plan.<br/><br/>3. End each game on spot of Ground plan colored RED, which is nearest to ending location for that particular game.<br/><br/>4. Playing discs marked &ldquo;Overtake player ahead&rdquo; does not apply in all games, since some players in some games will take entirely different routes to the goal.

        "description": "The ideal compact football game for the All-American armchair quarterback. An ideal game for families and parties. Can be played by 2 or 4 players.<br/><br/>This game has been especially designed to give &quot;Armchair Quarterbacks&quot;the opportunity to try their own football strategy. It is not a game of chance but creates realistic game situations in which the play outcomes depend on which player outwits his opponent.<br/><br/>The fold-out magnetic play board includes easy-to-read and easy-to-use scoreboards, time and play clock, indicators for &quot;yards to go&quot;, times out, wind factors, downs and quarter, and a scale model for the actual length of a football field with each yard line marked for recording of exact yardage. magnetic markers are used as the &quot;first down marker&quot; by placing it 10 yards in front of the ball when there's a first down.<br/><br/>The spinner-play selector cards are used to select play calls and punts, field goal attempts, extra points, fumble recoveries, penalties, length of kickoff returns, onside kicks and wind conditions.<br/><br/>There are 42 cards used for running plays including penalties, fumbles and injuries. There are 42 pass play cards including interceptions, fumbles and penalties. The pass completion rate is nearly 50%, with an average completion gain of over 11 yards and includes possibility for touchdowns. There are over 300 different outcomes possible from the use of these 84 cards.<br/><br/>Nearly total realism can be simulated by advanced players. but the game is enjoyable by players of all levels.<br/><br/>",

In this cracking game, teams of players compete to create items from modelling dough, whilst the others try to guess what's being made.  As this grand adventure continues, players can steal items as they move around the board and try to avoid Preston as he seeks to steal points.  The team who model and guess the most items will triumph as champion creators!<br/><br/>Description:<br/><br/>Teams take turns to roll-and-move their dough-modelled playing piece round the board, either modelling inventions out of dough or stealing inventions from another team.  Inventions are graded as hard (red / 3 points), medium (yellow / 2 points) or easy (green / 1 point).<br/><br/>On a modelling turn, the modeller makes as many as he can from that colour in one minute.  Each correctly-guessed invention moves the teams scoring piece along the scoring track by the appropriate number of spaces - first to 30 wins - and the team keep the card.<br/><br/>On a stealing turn, the team take a card from another team and advance that many spaces, while the other team goes back that many spaces, for a total swing of 2, 4 or 6 points.<br/><br/>After each turn, the team also roll-and-move the Preston piece either way round the board.  If it lands on another team, or another team land on it, that teams discards a card and loses the appropriate amount of points.<br/><br/>A variation listed in the rules is that dough cannot be reused during a turn, limiting the size and number of models that can be made.<br/><br/>Game contents:<br/><br/>Game board<br/>200 item cards<br/>3 pots of modelling dough<br/>3 modelling mats<br/>Preston playing piece<br/>3 playing pieces<br/>Sand timer<br/>Dice<br/>Instructions<br/><br/>",

They know their nuke will wipe out all traces of their crimes when the Countdown ends, but what of the small chance that a survivor escapes with the Hermit and his Intel?<br/><br/>Enter the MBI Black Ops squad, a team of 5 deadly Soldiers under the command of the ruthless Chrissy. Will they pick off any lucky survivors before the Countdown wipes out the rest of them? Or will they fall victim to the heroes much like the horde of Undead surrounding them all?<br/><br/>Introducing a new playable character, CHRISSY: the fair-haired Controller of the Black Ops squad. Ant was once his greatest student until Chrissy's thirst for innocent blood turned the young soldier against his team and into a life of isolation. Now armed with an even deadlier group of 5 Black Ops Soldiers, Chrissy has been sent into the heart of Zombie-infested Endicott with a simple mission from the heads of MBI: kill everyone and everything before it can escape the end of the Nuclear Countdown.<br/><br/>Hidden within the play deck amongst the flesh-craving Undead are the five Black Ops Soldiers. Uncover one, and become marked for execution. Try to fend off the Soldier with all your might until the sneaky assassins slither back into hiding within the remainder of the deck. Beware, once you are marked you run the risk of being executed sooner than you think! Take a breather from combating the Undead in order to attempt to remove the marks; but don't spend too much time to yourself - every attempt to remove a mark, whether successful or not, will cost you some of your slain Zombies.<br/><br/>When the time comes, Chrissy will send out the command to his Soldiers to EXECUTE! Roll the die when the command is drawn; the matching marks are instantly executed and players take damage (potentially fatal, if you have a hard time removing your marks). But that's not all - sometimes the Execute commands will allow more than one Soldier to execute their marks, spelling certain doom for any players who have unwillingly collected a variety of marks from several different Soldiers. If you fall victim to one of the Soldiers, respawning is no longer an option. You are instantly killed and any Cure cards you were holding become compromised with the Solders' evil decoy-deception. Now your allies must roll a successful Cure Retrieval value TWICE before they can take the Cure card and win the game.<br/><br/>Despite their advantages in both stealth and strength, the Black Ops Soldiers are still only human. If you can manage to do so, killing one will reward you dearly - not in points and not in monetary value, but with the knowledge that you and your comrades can walk the desolate streets of an apocalyptic Endicott with a bit more safety. But beware - the Zombies still run amok, and they LOVE adrenaline-pumped prey!<br/><br/>Contents:<br/><br/>18 Game Cards <br/>88 5/8&quot; Chits <br/> 7 Game Mats<br/> 1 Full Color 2-sided rules sheet<br/><br/>",

All other players then simultaneously try to answer the question by secretly placing one of their four answers cards (A,B,C or D) face down on the table. Each player with the correct answer then progresses his meeple on a linear track, according to the predetermined difficulty rating of the question.<br/><br/>The questions are divided into the categories Science, History, Sport, Culture, People and Local. Some are simple and some are very tricky. For example, one can score if one knows that the local museum houses the original death mask of William Shakespeare, that the 1990 world-championship in solar racing was won by students of the city's university, that &quot;Kn&auml;&auml;rze&quot; is local slang for the end piece of a bread, or the country were the 2009 world championship in amateur boxing had been won by a local boxer.<br/><br/>The game is of standard quality for a German boardgame with 6 classical wooden meeples and a full-color thick cardboard board. Each of the 165 full-sized double-sided question cards features a color photo or picture in relation to its question.<br/><br/>",

Should you play your cards right, you could end up with a ring. But don't get cocky: Many, many beautiful women have tried to play this game &mdash; and ended up dead.<br/><br/>Beginning in the Foyer, each bachelorette vies to gather a six-pack of ice-cold beer and make her way to the center ring to claim the prize. The winner is the first lady to land, by precise count, on the center ring with at least six beers in her possession.<br/>Danny Hellman<br/>The packaging of the Bad Beer Baron Bachelor Edition board game.<br/>The packaging of the Bad Beer Baron Bachelor Edition board game.<br/><br/>DIRECTIONS<br/>The player deemed most attractive (without the aid of beer goggles) gets to roll first, followed by the player to her right and so on. Players advance counterclockwise around the board, gaining one beer each time they pass the Foyer. Additional beer may be gained, or lost, by drawing a Manservant Card and by following the instructions therein.<br/><br/>Each room in the mansion is a shortcut and can be accessed by landing on the orange square permitting entry to that room. However, each room carries the potential for a player's untimely demise. Upon entering the room, players must roll the die and follow instructions for that room. If/when a player is killed &mdash; and history argues strongly for &quot;when&quot; &mdash; she loses whatever beer she's accumulated and must return to the Foyer to start over.<br/><br/>Only one player is permitted at a time on any square on the pathway. (The Baron is frisky but not into the holy Trinity, if you know what we mean.) If you land on a space occupied by another player, roll the die a second time and send your rival that number of spaces in the direction of your choosing. Rooms can have more than one occupant.<br/><br/>This game is a work of pure fiction. Any resemblance to real people, events, actual beer barons or real dead girls is only a matter of coincidence.<br/><br/>No actual women were harmed in the making of this game. Several beers were obliterated, however.<br/><br/>",

All of the artwork is original. Printed on fabric, the board design reflects The Dude&rsquo;s rug, the maguffin of the film.<br/><br/>Goal<br/>Move to the center of the board and get The Dude&rsquo;s rug, which is a poker chip placed in the center space. The player must then get home with the rug.<br/>     <br/>Game Mechanics<br/>It&rsquo;s a roll-and-move game. The board is laid out in a circle, with 8 starting points on the perimeter. The player may roll a single die, or for more control (to land on a more desirable space) may bowl instead. 5 bowling pins and 2 marbles are included. 1 marble is rolled and each pin knocked down equals 1 space. Each space requires its own action, or inaction. E.g. answer a trivia question and roll again. <br/>The players may move in any direction, there is no predetermined path. Once a player gets possession of the rug, the other players must catch up and challenge for possession. This is determined by a roll-off. Each player bowls a frame, and the best score wins possession of the rug.<br/><br/>There is some adult content. This game is not intended for little Larrys.<br/><br/>",

Backers is a creative game involving drawing, writing, and the playing of instruments.<br/><br/>Play consists of about five phases, called Objectives: Spiritual Amalgamation, Space Definition, Automaton Production, Dramatic Operation, and the Resulting Objectives.  Via collaborative mechanics, the players create a map and characters which they then influence through a series of job rotations.  Objects and characters are defined by motivations.  Players may cause things and characters to interact in ways contrary to their motivations through the expenditure of points.<br/><br/>Backers: Amalgamations of the Spiritual Hinterlands is designed to facilitate and moderate the formation of collaborative playgrounds in a simple and comprehensive way with an eye toward personal extension balanced by a diminished role for the ego.

It contains 720 cards, listing 90 words in 8 diffent foreign languages (english, esperanto, polish, swedish, french, spanish, italian, and turkish), along with their phonetic transcription. The german translation printed on the back. The objective is to collect cards with the same word in different languages.<br/><br/>During gameplay, there are always 12 face-down stacks (german translation showing) and a good number of face-up cards (name in other language showing) in the center, plus groups of cards (with the same word in different languages) in front of the players. In his turn, a player takes any 2 cards; if their translation matches, he keeps them as a group in front of him, otherwise he puts them back face-up (thus the number of face-up cards increases over the course of the game). He may even steal a whole group of cards from another player if he can match them with one more card with the same word.<br/><br/>The game ends after a set time. Winner is the player who collected most cards.<br/><br/>Awards: <br/>Bronze medal at the IENA Erfindermesse 2004<br/>Auswahlliste Deutscher Lernspielpreis 2004<br/><br/>",

The game will increase reading and spelling ability. It will stimulate interest in and understanding of words.<br/><br/>&quot;Created and developed by a professional educator, Ends 'N Blends has been tested and proven successful in the home and classroom. While playing the game, hundreds of words will be formed by combining word beginnings (consonants and 'blends') with word endings ('word families'). As he plays, your child will master the use of word families and learn to read a countless number of new words independently.&quot; <br/>(From the rules introduction.)<br/><br/>The game consists of a game board divided into eight columns and eleven rows. Every third 'cell' contains a word segment such as &quot;all&quot;, &quot;ap&quot;, &quot;ick&quot;, &quot;ay&quot;, &quot;ook&quot; and several others. There is a spinner evenly divided into two sets of the numbers 1-5 and a &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; section. A set of over ten dozen &quot;Ends 'N Blends&quot; cards or tiles each contains a single word segment such as &quot;sn&quot;, &quot;ight&quot;, &quot;ot&quot;, &quot;at&quot;, &quot;tr&quot;, &quot;g&quot;, &quot;fl&quot;, &quot;ing&quot;, and many others. Forty-two &quot;Hit or Miss&quot; cards carry instructions such as &quot;Return one point marker&quot;, &quot;Take one end 'n blend. Spin again.&quot;, &quot;Take one end 'n blend card from each player. Spin again.&quot;, and so forth. A small box holds approximately 40 thin, transparent red discs used for points. Finally, a small booklet entitled &quot;Your Child's Reading: Suggestions For Parents&quot; is included.<br/><br/>Players use the spinner to determine the number of &quot;Ends 'N Blends&quot; cards/tiles to draw. The player then places these cards on the board, matching them up to the word segments there to form as many whole words as possible. He then receives one point (red disc) for each whole word. First player to fifteen wins. If the spinner points to &quot;Hit or Miss&quot;, the player draws one of those cards and follows the instructions.<br/><br/>",

The system of game immerses us therefore in an epic history, where nobles and necromantics hit in battles that re-draw the scene, and where conspiracies and disputes between races and clans modify the balances between the good and evil constant.<br/>In each of the events, the players leading the Heroes of Armarath they will try of affecting the destiny of the kingdom acquiring skills, followers and equipments that improve his inventory. The goal of the game is to defeat the enemy who waits in the catacombs of the Armarath, a hard quest that demands a powerful hero.<br/>The game is based on the Runebound play-system, but improves many aspects, like the amount of quest-cards (230), object cards (130) and game board (a detailed map of the kingdom of Armarath).<br/><br/>Website: armarath.blogspot.com<br/><br/>",

At each turn the player moves his pawn one square in the direction of his choice, it then returns a token located on a square adjacent to his. Any box with token returned is impracticable; boxes passable by the pegs are empty boxes, boxes with chips and boxes not returned to Jake. The token returned can be used as a token-enabling move by 2 in 4 boxes or token &quot;Albatross&quot; to climb the mountain, these chips are to keep by the player who can use them next round.<br/><br/>Some chips are disadvantageous with either back to square one, or loss of a token already won (penalties or both!), Or the return of Cody on the mountain if the player picked it up. These chips are on the box and make it impassable. Other tokens can counteract the disadvantageous chips.<br/>To win the game you must pick up Cody at the top of the mountain, passing through the passages between the two sides of the plate and bring it back to his cabin, avoiding many pitfalls!<br/><br/>",

From the outermost to the innermost they are: Money, Influence, Scandal, and Power.<br/><br/>All players start in the Money ring. They roll and move and attempt to accumulate cash by encountering different spaces on the game board. (A healthy $500 million is required in the last step of the game, so players will spend a fair amount of time in this ring.)<br/><br/>When a player feels that she has the resources to deal with the hazards of the next step in the game, she moves her pawn to the Scandal ring. At this point, chance dictates the various pitfalls the player will encounter in the spaces of this area. There are Penalty and Bonus spaces in this ring that require players to draw cards from the Penalty and Bonus decks. (These generally involve gaining or loosing money.)<br/><br/>The Power ring provides players with the possibility of recovering funds lost in the Scandal ring.<br/><br/>The first player to finish their turn in the center of the Power ring with $500 cash on hand wins.<br/><br/>",

One of the running gags of the Gaston Lagaffe comic books involves a businessman, Demesmaeker visiting the office building in which Gaston work to sign contracts with Gaston's boss, Prunelle. Each time the contracts are about to be signed Gaston screws up or tests one of his inventions and the contracts are ruined.<br/><br/>In the game, the player roll dice and move around the board, attempting to collect three Contracts cards representing Lagaffe, Demesmaeker and Prunelle. Once the three cards are gathered, the player must exchange them for a &quot;Signed Contracts&quot; cards and take it to the photocopier to win. Cards are drawn or taken from other players according to the board space the player lands on. If a player can't give a card to another player, he receives a &quot;blunder&quot; token. If he has three, he exchanges his blunder tokens for the &quot;mega-blunder&quot; card, which prevents him from getting a &quot;Signed Contracts&quot; card or using the photocopier. The only way of getting rid of a &quot;mega-blunder&quot; card is to wait until another player gets it.<br/><br/>",

When a player uses up all their letters, all players take a new tile from the pool. When all the tiles are gone, the first player to use up all the tiles in their hand wins.<br/><br/>The game is suitable for solo, group and team play, and may be adjusted to reflect different accents and even other languages that can be expressed in basic IPA phonemes.<br/><br/>",

Players must balance their play between researching technologies, expanding cities and building units. Having only a limited number of actions per turn, it is important for players to consider their activities carefully so that they maximize their ability to collect cards. The first player to collect seven of one type of victory card wins the game.<br/><br/>This game is based on hex-grid map boards and players can choose which sections of the map to assemble. Currently there are maps of Europe and the Caribbean, although plans for future maps will cover the entire world. Players lay tiles down to form cities and can build military units to protect them or attack others. Cities create the wealth that a player needs to further their empire.<br/><br/>Players take turns to perform their moves, building their empire up while keeping a close eye on their neighbors to prevent them beating them to the end. Open play allows players to watch other players activities, and manage resources in way that can stop other players winning while not hindering their own advancement.<br/><br/>The game has been designed to give flexibility to the rules so that players can develop in-house versions of the rules without breaking the game. One popular alteration is in the collection of cards. Players can change the speed and dynamic of the game by changing how many and of which types of card need to be collected.<br/><br/>The game is fully customizable allowing players to design their own versions including army units, maps, technologies and rules.

The caller randomly pulls from the stock of 75 tokens, and reads aloud the column letter (G, R, A, F, or O) and title of a play, book, poem, or short story and optionally the author number. If the author of that work is on his or her card, a player marks that square with a translucent disk, hoping to be the first to get five in a row. Can be played in three difficulty levels:<br/><br/>1) Playing by the numbers. The caller reads the column letter, title, and author number. This makes the game no harder than Bingo with some trivia thrown in.<br/><br/>2) Playing by the book. The caller omits the author number, but players have access to a &quot;Bio/graphics&quot; booklet in which they can find the author of the named work.<br/><br/>3) Playing for mastery. Players no longer have access to the book and have to recall from memory the author of the named work.<br/><br/>A player calls &quot;Grafo&quot; when he or she covers five squares in a row on his or her card, and once verified is declared the winner.<br/><br/>",

As you play your troops will suffer casualties , You rotate the dice to reduce the strength of a piece.<br/><br/>The object of the game is to control the board, or to eliminate the enemy.

The attacker and defender roll a d6 for further support and add or subtract the numbers from the battle-score total.  A positive result allows the attacker to reduce the enemy force by that number, and a negative battle-score allows the defending player to do the same.<br/><br/>At the beginning of every turn, a d6 is rolled, this gives the current player one of six combat advantages:<br/>1) bomb any land unit and reduce by 2.<br/>2) move any unit by 3<br/>3) add 1 to every combat this turn<br/>4) build a friendly airfield , next to ant land unit<br/>5) fighter attack reduce any plane unit by 2<br/>6) hide any unit for 2 turns<br/><br/>The game also includes optional rules for mines.<br/><br/>",

The cat wins when she is able to capture all mice.  The mice win when one mouse succeeds at arriving at the winning point.<br/><br/>Car Race - A game of dice for 2 to 4 players from the age of 6 on.
