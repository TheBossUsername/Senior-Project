        "description": "Being a gnome that makes a living by digging for treasure can be hard work.  Especially when there are grumpy trolls laying underground.  In this game, you are a gnome that gets to build a series of tunnels underground, and then gets to dig in the hopes of gathering enough gems and gold to reach the final goal!<br/><br/>You assemble a modular board that is different with each game, and depending on how deep you dig, you may find treasures or trolls or even impervious rocks that damage your ability to defend yourself as you dig.  As you go through the deck of cards, the tunnels will get darker, the trolls will get stronger, and your ability to defend yourself will weaken as you mine tough stones that break your shovels.<br/><br/>On each turn, you move through the tunnels, choose to dig, and try to empty your treasures out of your backpack and into your home base (the tin).  The more treasures you sell, the higher your score.<br/><br/>This is a print-and-play game with components that fit into a typical mint tin container (paper tile pieces, paperclips, dice).<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Each character card features a variety of items the player needs to collect to fill their fanny pack, like knee pads for the roller blader and a ring pop for the tween girl. Players trade cards to get the items they need, with each player aiming to be the first to fill their fanny pack. All pieces tuck nicely into the totally '90s-tastic neon fanny pack, and points are tracked using classic '90s milk caps.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

You have your eyes set on one goal: playing a successful show at The Ultiplex, the greatest concert venue in the land. To do it, you'll need to use your inspiration points to write and practice songs, recruit bandmates, and keep their egos happy, or else they'll leave you to start a solo career (or worse, join an opponent's band). Along the way, you'll live the artist lifestyle, and work your way up to The Ultiplex with gigs at the dive bar Midnightly, and the hipster cafe the Artful Baboon.<br/><br/>To play songs, you roll a 12-sided die and add up any artist or bandmate bonuses you have. A strong performance will earn you a &quot;Good&quot; result, and an epic performance earns you a &quot;Sick&quot; result. Each venue requires a certain number of songs played &quot;Sick&quot; in order to have a successful show. You'll carefully craft your set-list, with songs requiring different instrument combinations to play: keyboard, drums, and guitar. Make sure you stroke the ego of your guitar-playing bandmate Tennessee, because if she leaves you, you're never going to play that &quot;Anthem That Glorifies Being Young and Lost&quot; or the &quot;Song with a Catchy Chorus but No Verses.&quot;<br/><br/>Turn up your speakers, tune your guitar, and try to become a One Hit Wonder!<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A deck-building game that allows you to play as one of eight different shadow casters who can cast a variety of different spells against fellow players. Game features role-playing elements and the concept of levelling up too.<br/><br/>Each player begins by choosing the shadowcaster they wish to play as, which each comes with its own choice of cards and decks to use, along with certain special abilities. Players also choose a shadow card which gives them further abilities that stat with them throughout the game.<br/><br/>Players then take turns in playing the cards (spells, creatures or forms of energy) in their hands that they can or adding new cards to their hands. The game gets deeply strategic in that players can also level up giving them access to more powerful abilities and additional shadow cards. The risk being that a player remains vulnerable for an entire round to do so.<br/><br/>The objective of the game is to be the last shadowcaster on the board. The game can be played individually with others or in teams.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Muffin Mythos is a semi-coop all vs. one game of Cthulhu fighting goodness.<br/><br/>All of the armies of the world have been defeated by the legendary monster Cthulhu. Civilization has crumbled beneath the chaos and destruction. Mankind is left defeated and without hope of any salvation. An unlikely group of rebels have come together to defeat the monster. They call themselves the Shepherds. Coming together in unity has not been easy for the Shepherds, as some of them only fight for personal glory and gain. However they are united through one common purpose: defeat Cthulhu, and save the future of mankind.<br/><br/>With all the world's armies defeated, salvation seems impossible. Until one day, a small peculiar stranger appears covered head to toe by a robe. He speaks in a low grizzly voice, muttering to himself as he limps towards them. What appears to be crumbs fall to the floor with every word he mumbles.<br/><br/>&quot;I'm too late, they won't listen.&quot; he grumbles to himself. &quot;Doom. Doom.&quot; The stranger hobbles closer to the Shepherds, more crumbs falling to the ground as he moves. &quot;Hope, there is hope. You must listen. You must find them.&quot; The stranger grabs hold of the collar of a Shepherd pulling himself close.<br/><br/>&quot;Find the Muffins.&quot;<br/><br/>The stranger collapses to the floor and seems to disappear as crumbs scatter across the room.<br/><br/>In Muffin Mythos players will build an army by rolling and re-rolling dice in farkle, or yahtzee style. Players recruit their army by scoring their dice without rolling a Cthulhu symbol on a custom wood engraved die. They may also explore the city and find companions, and items which will help them in their quest.<br/><br/>One player will play as Cthulhu and will roll dice in a similar way, but instead of recruiting an army the Cthulhu player will destroy townspeople and the town itself.<br/><br/>Players may optionally choose to brawl with their friends in order to raise their army's power and ultimately be the sole Shepherd responsible for defeating Cthulhu.<br/><br/>Once a player believes their army is strong enough to defeat Cthulhu, they may engage Cthulhu in battle. Once a player is engaged they may not disengage or allow Cthulhu to take a special attack against the players army. If a player's army is defeated they lose all items and companions and start back in the town with nothing.<br/><br/>Cthulhu wins when he defeats a certain number of townspeople or destroys a certain number of town cards.<br/><br/>Players win by either single handedly defeating Cthulhu, or working together to defeat him.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Music Snob is a party game for hardcore music fans.<br/><br/>Each player always has a hand of 5 Artist Cards. Each card lists the name of one musical artist. Artists include hitmakers,  the critically acclaimed, and the influential across rock, pop, R&amp;B, hip-hop, jazz, blues, folk and even some new age.<br/><br/>On a player's turn they select one of three Award Cards that are face up on the table. The card you select will guide you in which three artist cards you will play face up to the table. Award cards include parameters such as, &quot;My favorite.&quot;, &quot;A guilty pleasure.&quot;, &quot;The most influential.&quot;, &quot;Worst vocals.&quot;, &quot;Best lyrics.&quot;, &quot;Most likely to be a Star Trek fan.&quot;, &quot;Will be forgotten the quickest.&quot;, &quot;The biggest sellout.&quot;, &quot;Best dynamics.&quot;, &quot;Best bass playing.&quot;, &quot;Best vocal harmonies.&quot; and many more. There are plans to have around 130 Award Cards in the base game.<br/><br/>After the active player selects an Award Card, they place three Artist Cards from their hand face up on the table marked #1, #2, and #3, each other player, and the active player then places a 1, 2, or 3 marker face down on the table in front of themselves.<br/><br/>When all players have made their selection, all players reveal. Each player that matches the active player's selection gets 1 point. If ALL player select the active players pick, the active player gets points listed on the Award card (2 to 4 points depending on the difficulty of the Award Card).<br/><br/>The game is built for musicians, and rabid music fans who really love music and enjoy debating subjective creative musical talent.<br/><br/>There is a game variant that has the active player selecting an Award Card and all other players throwing in an answer from their hand of 5 Artist Cards. The active player then picks their favorite, giving 1 point to the player whose card was selected.<br/><br/>Example rounds:<br/><br/>Pick a guilty pleasure.<br/><br/>     Ambrosia<br/>     Air Supply<br/>     Justin Timberlake<br/><br/><br/>Best background vocals.<br/><br/>     The Beatles<br/>     The Staple Singers<br/>     Sly &amp; The Family Stone<br/><br/><br/>Most likely to go to hell.<br/><br/>     Slayer<br/>     50 Cent<br/>     Madonna<br/><br/><br/>Best Lyrics.<br/><br/>     Tom Waits<br/>     Bob Dylan<br/>     Rush<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This set introduces the Harmony Rare card rarity for the first time. Secret Rares get a brand new foil treatment and are now textured, their 3D raised foiling follows the lines of the card artwork; this unique foil technology means it is embedded in the card itself rather than stamped on top of it. Secret Rares also have an improved pack-out ratio of 1 in every 4 boxes on average, or 3 per case, while Harmony Rares are found 1 per case as a case topper.<br/><br/>Lots of new things are introduced from a gameplay standpoint with this expansion, including new mechanics, Abilities and rarity effects. The set is optimized for both Constructed and Booster Draft formats with effects now being in every rarity tier all the way down to Common (you can draft Common symmetries unlike with Galaxy Tides).<br/><br/>Following the conclusion of the Crystal Forge storyline from the Exodus TCG Official Magazine Issue #2, turmoil is abundant on Eeventide when it is disturbed to the point where its portals are thrown off course and start colliding into each other. These collisions create massive rips and tears in the fabric of space and time, opening up a new form of dimensional travel. However, these dimensional rifts signify permanent damage to Eeventide's atmosphere. Sentient smoke-like creatures called Chronos spill into the world soon after. The Chronos' are seen ripping apart portals, further destroying the shortcuts available to Drifters. But the biggest secret of all lies within the planet itself. It's well known by this point that Eeventide has a will of its own, but what exactly will happen when the very landscapes are called to rise up to defend themselves...?<br/><br/>Set Breakdown:<br/><br/>This set consists of 91 cards, including:<br/>        3 Harmony Rares<br/>        8 Secret Rares<br/>        31 Rares<br/>        22 Uncommons<br/>        27 Commons<br/><br/>Of the 8 Secret Rares, one of them (Grandaria, Forger of Songs) can only be found as a fixed box topper in sealed booster boxes and not in packs themselves.<br/>        The other 7 Secret Rares have a packaging ratio of 1 in every 4 boxes, or 3 per case.<br/><br/>Box Toppers<br/><br/>Box Toppers are extra/bonus cards included as incentive when opening an entire booster box or display.<br/>        Box Toppers are always Foil.<br/>        1 of the 2 Box Toppers in every box is &quot;fixed&quot;, meaning it is the same card in every box.<br/>        The 2nd Box Topper is a random Foil from the booster set (Uncommon or higher).<br/><br/>Sneak Peek Creature Types<br/><br/>Continuing a trend from the first booster set, there is a hidden pattern in each booster set that identify which new creature types the storyline will focus on in the near future. The pattern is 1 of that creature type in each main Rarity tier (Common, Uncommon &amp; Rare) within the set (excluding dual-types). For Converging Chasms, the new preview types are Chrono &amp; Machine.<br/><br/>Creature Types<br/><br/>This set introduces the following creature types:<br/><br/>- Chrono<br/>  - Stag<br/>  - Owl<br/>  - Octopus<br/>  - Bull<br/><br/>",

Besties put their friendship to the test in this party game that challenges them to answer &quot;would you rather&quot; questions with identical responses. Teams of friends wear a heart locket belt and each time they answer the same way, they turn the knob that brings the halves of the locket-and the two besties-closer together. Mismatched answers require them to draw a Bonding Moment card that instructs them to perform hilarious and often awkward activities. Completing the challenges can strengthen their friendship as it closes the distance between their halves of the heart locket. The team of besties that ends with the fewest Bonding Moment cards wins the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

        "description": "NATO Goes Nuts brings the Absent Superpower Series to Europe as Old and New Europe square off.<br/><br/>NATO Goes Nuts: The Coming Polish-German War. As America withdraws from the world, there will be vast repercussions. In Europe, the international security guarantees put in place in 1945 will be gone. That will mean the old national rivalries that twice in 30 years sent the continent into world wars will reemerge. The scenario here covers Central Europe, where the presumed near-future emergence in Germany of the ultra-nationalist AFD as the majority party ignites fear and loathing in Poland.<br/><br/>The Poles understand the overarching fact of their national existence is this: if Russia and Germany are both strong at the same time, independent Poland is doomed. Russia is already relatively strong and armed with atomic weapons; it&rsquo;s therefore too late for anything to be done about that.<br/><br/>To the west of Poland, an AFD-run Germany would no doubt soon rearm and become strong. The Poles therefore resolve to act before that happens. They strike into eastern Germany with the objective of taking Berlin and setting up a compliant and friendly regime there.<br/><br/>Alternatively, we can also postulate a Poland that continues its own recent drift toward the far right, culminating in a quasi-fascist government in Warsaw. That regime might act in order to forestall a nascent far-right German regime, or it might move against even a moderate-left German regime in order to forestall further Muslim immigration into Central Europe.<br/><br/>The game uses a battalion-level evolution of the alternating action system from America Falling to model this near-future war in Central Europe. One large-hex 34x22&rdquo; map covering all of eastern Germany at five miles per hex (8 km), along with one sheet of 228 medium-size (9/16&rdquo;) counters. Rules cover such things as the possibility of Czech intervention on the German side and a Turkish-Islamist uprising in Muslim sections of Berlin.

Who hasn't been stirred by Frederick's extraordinary victory over the Austrian host at Leuthen, or his shattering defeat at Kolin? <br/>You cannot understand the Seven Tears War without battles, and so we offer this first of two studies of the essential actions of Frederick the Great's most important war.<br/><br/>Lobositz - 30 September, 1756<br/>Prague - 6 May, 1757<br/>Kolin - 18 June, 1757<br/>Rossbach - 5 November, 1757<br/>Leuthen - 5 December, 1757<br/>Hochkirch - 14 October, 1758<br/>Liegnitz - 15 August, 1760<br/>Torgau - 4 November, 1760<br/>Freiburg - 28 October, 1762<br/>Each battle includes a historical summary, detailed battle map, notes on game representation of terrain, deployment, game length, and victory.<br/><br/>A detailed game order of battle is of course provided. It also serves as a game roster sheet and is intended to be photocopied by the players and used during the game. The order of battle gives you as much information as possible about the armies. Often game units are made up of several historic units, and wherever possible those historic units are noted.<br/><br/>Regardless of what rules systems you enjoy, BATTLES OF THE SEVEN YEARS WAR is an indispensable game and historical resource. Look for its forthcoming companion volume, covering the battles with the Russians, German allies, and French.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This is a cooperative game where the goal is to finish the chosen scenario with every character alive (at least with 1 hit point left).<br/><br/>Before playing, you must chose a scenario (there's also an option for custom game) by putting together 4 square pieces to make a square board and using tokens which will be used to accomplish the quest of the scenario.<br/><br/>The goal of a scenario can be to find specific tiles or kill a specific enemy for example.<br/><br/>On each colored emplacement of the board you put a tile face down. Tiles can be enemies, quest items, gold or bonuses. There also are shop tiles.<br/><br/>Each player chose a character between Ruel, Evangeline, Yugo or Tristepin and take the corresponding card and figurine. Each card shows the character's hit points, inventory space, which dice they use to attack and defend (4, 6 or 8 faces). Each character also has a different set of tokens which represent which actions they can do.<br/><br/>Turn sequence is players play first, then monsters.<br/><br/>During a player's turn, each player secretly choose their 3 actions at the same time, then they reveal the 3 actions together.<br/><br/>Turn order is always the same : Ruel plays first, then it's Tristepin, Evangeline and Yugo last.<br/><br/>Every player plays one action in this order until everyone has played their 3 actions.<br/><br/>Actions are : <br/>- movement : When a character arrives on a quarter of the board, all the tiles of that quarter are turned face up.<br/><br/>- hand to hand or bow attack : to attack, the player rolls the corresponding dice as shown on their character's card. If it's higher than the monster's armor, the player wins and the monster tile is discarded and the player earns money.<br/><br/>- spell : only yugo has the spell action which he can use to teleport.<br/><br/>- gift an item to someone (so they can heal or to have more room in the inventory)<br/><br/>When everyone has played their 3 actions it's the monsters' turn: Each player has a monster color, randomly chosen at the beginning of the game. Each player moves and makes an attack with the monster which is on a tile the color he has.<br/><br/>Monsters always attack in the same way. Monsters who are on a red tile attacks Tristepin, yellow attack Ruel, green attack Evangeline and Blue attack Yugo.<br/><br/>Monsters attack the same way the players do. If the monsters are successful, the player attacked loses hit points on their character's card.<br/><br/>The game continue this way until the scenario goal is reached (all the players win) or until one of the players has no more hit point (all the players lose).<br/><br/>&quot;Choose your favorite character and make a team ready to fight the terrible Bouftous.<br/>Together, Tristepin, Yugo, Evangelyne and Ruel will overcome thrilling quests!<br/>Your missions? Find Ruel's lost Kamas, avoid Miss Moches' kisses or hunt Bouftous. If you need a better equipement, visit Kabrok the shoppkeeper.<br/>&quot;Wakfu, le jeu d'aventure&quot; is a cooperative game where all the players fight, win together and share the loot.&quot;<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Boardgame LibertEx!<br/><br/>The game is the path to financial freedom<br/>Once, five financiers sat and drank compote. One of them leaned back in his chair and said: &ldquo;Guys, let's make a game about how we got into these chairs. Well, where do we get such cars, such as apartments, and such grandmothers? &rdquo; The second one recalled how he had lived in a hostel for six months and ate a doshirak to maintain a store ... As a result, the LibertEx game appeared - about rat-running &ldquo;work for an uncle&rdquo;, about a gradual understanding that money is not a goal, but a tool and big dreams. The fourth edition of this game is in front of you.<br/><br/>Everything is as in reality<br/>The playing field is your daily routine. You can work harder, get tired more, and earn a little more - until you fall off from accumulated fatigue. And you can use your time a little smarter - to implement your ideas and search for opportunities.<br/><br/>What are the possibilities?<br/>Well, for example, your neighbor may come to you and offer to open a kiosk with shawarma. Or your classmate will offer you to buy a furniture factory because he is leaving for Cyprus. Or you just learn something valuable and interesting. Opportunities are anything you want, from a valuable spare part found in a landfill that you brought home and repaired before purchasing the enterprise. The main thing is to use them correctly. The strategy is that you do not have to grab at every chance: it is important to understand what, when, and how it will bring you money.<br/><br/>Need to count?<br/>Yes, this is a personal finance game. You will have to count quite a lot - but, believe me, every second of working with your head will pay off. After a couple of parties, you can quickly figure out not only how many years you will earn on a new apartment, but also how much it is more profitable to invest in stocks and indices in comparison with the purchase of the McDonald's franchise.<br/><br/>What is the purpose of the game?<br/>The main objective of the game is to make your passive income (coming regardless of your actions) exceed your fixed costs (for example, food, home, clothes, and so on). Once you achieve this, you win.<br/><br/>But what about a yacht and a plane?<br/>There are dreams in the game - this is what makes you happy. For some, the limit of happiness is a new iPhone, for some - their own yacht, and someone will not be able to live without a concert of their favorite star. All the dreams in the game are clearly tied to the real world and to Russia - if you see the price for a million red roses, it means that it costs so much. Not very expensive by the standards of the oligarchs, by the way. To find out prices for concerts of stars, diamonds, cars, and other services or things, the creators sent inquiries as if they were going to buy it themselves. So the prices are real. Take courage.<br/><br/>Why do I need holiday cards?<br/>Because you can&rsquo;t work all the time. Health, family, and other values ​​are taken into account in LibertEx - otherwise nothing. In other economic games, you need to work and work, but here the goal is to become happy. Therefore, do not forget to relax and spend time with loved ones.<br/><br/>What kind of news cards?<br/>These cards change the game situation. When you reach a level where exchange rates, the value of stocks, and valuable metals will be of great importance, you will begin to read the news far from the usual person.<br/><br/>A crisis!<br/>Yes, there are crises in the game. They may come unexpectedly like a thick polar fox. Everything is like in the 90s, in 2008, and in other best years of our economy. It will be fun, and the little bottle will come in handy. And what is the economy in Russia without such a risk?<br/><br/>Well and most importantly<br/>Perhaps, based on the results or during the game, you will find your personal path to financial freedom and independence.<br/><br/>",

You will have a set number of Crew and Soldiers to explore but you better leave some crew and soldiers behind to protect the ship from the hostile natives. As you explore the three Islands, you will develop a map to help you along the way. You will also need to collect or buy wood to build a raft so you can cross to the next island. Two of the Islands have Tribal Chiefs that are hidden and you must find. These Chiefs will each give you half of the secret location of the temple.<br/><br/>The Chief will either greet you with hostility or friendship depending on how you treat his people. As you explore you will come across different types of villages that you can trade with or overtake if necessary. Some will be hostile and automatically attack you while others will be friendly. Keep track of your food because if you run out your crew will start to die from starvation. Try to obtain medicine in case your crew get sick from the natives. Once you've spoke with both Chiefs you will have the secret location and can travel to the last island. Search the island and find the Temple to set your name in history and your King the richest in the nation. If you lose all your crew you lose the game.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Players then place new game pieces on the board. They may choose to do this in one of two ways: they may place a single game piece anywhere on the board. Or they may make a &ldquo;trail&rdquo; by following any straight-line path from one of their already-placed game pieces (as a Bacterium, after all, you want to spread yourself as far as you can.) The Player then &quot;reproduces&quot; by placing his pieces in each empty spot in between along the three-space trail, reflecting the rapid growth of the bacteria. Every Petri dish game space he has thereby infected then becomes a potential source for further infections.<br/><br/>In addition to moving, game pieces can be captured by surrounding a Bacterium and starving it of resources so it dies and is replaced by the Player's Bacteria.<br/><br/>In addition, there are Penicillin Spores that are floating around in the lab which will land randomly, killing the Bacteria in some Petri dishes and replacing them. Every so often, Players roll dice to determine where the Penicillin has landed. If there are any Bacteria game pieces in these marked spaces, they are removed and replaced with an Opponent&rsquo;s game piece.<br/><br/>Play continues until neither Player is able to make a legal move. The Player whose Bacteria occupy the most Petri dishes at the end of the game, is the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

It is absolutely entertaining to spot the caricatures of prominent persons in the game and to discover their independent categorization.

The game is based around a combination of arithmetic / word problem / stacking questions, on Game Cards - correct answers earn you Antcoins - and luck, which comes from Fortune Cards.<br/><br/>Fortune cards allow players to hijack each other's turns, (Harry Hijack) get money from the bank,(Jin Genie) make each other miss their goes,(Miss A. Go) and steal each other's money (The Thief.) A blocking card (Ronnie Resist) allows players to defend themselves. You get a new fortune card every time you cash in 100 Antcoins with the bank. Fortune cards are also interspersed with game cards. The person with the most money when the time is up, wins.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to have fun and get better at math. The game is based around the UK and US math curricula, and as such is suitable for use in an educational setting. It is available in 3 Levels of difficulty.<br/><br/>It has become curriculum for gifted students in some US counties, but it is also widely used in Special Ed / SEND classrooms, including psychiatric homes.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

Then the other players as a group have to guess which options the storyteller has chosen. The storyteller then reveals how many, buy not which choices were guessed right. Now the group can use communication cards, which asks the storyteller to give a hint - a word, a drawing, a musical hint, etc. After that, the group has to guess again. This is repeated until the right combination of story line options is guessed. Now another player becomes storyteller. Every story fully guessed right, earns a point.

        "description": "Discover the world of magic and become the master of spells. Gain special powers to create the powerful potions of the great wizards and witches. Use magical ingredients along with unique spells to cleverly outwit other mages. Your acumen and craft will help you gain victory in this fast paced, dual round tactical game. Leave everyone spellbound with your wizardry and rule the supernatural world!<br/><br/>In Mystic Arts, players duel to win powerful potions of great wizards and witches. The goal is to be the first player to win two good potions.<br/><br/>There are 3 types of cards - Ingredient cards, Spell cards. Potion cards. The ingredient cards are of 3 types: length, volume and weight cards. Spell cards are special power cards that can help you win a potion. you can play these for yourself or against an opponent. Some spell cards have the link symbol these cards attach to the ingredient card that is played. The potion cards are of 2 types: good potions and bad potions. Players must win the good potions and avoid the bad potions.<br/><br/>To setup the game: shuffle the ingredient cards and spell cards, separately, and distribute 8 ingredient cards and 4 spell cards to each player. These are the hand cards. Shuffle the potion cards and keep them face down in the center. Player with the highest dice roll gets the player token and starts the first round. Then the player token will move clockwise after each round is completed.<br/><br/>In one round of play: Open the topmost potion card. First is the ingredient round. Each player places an ingredient card, face down, in front of them. If it is a good potion, players must play an ingredient card that is closest to any one value on the potion card. If it is a bad potion, players must play an ingredient card that is farthest to any one value on the potion card.<br/><br/>Remember, you can play only 1 ingredient card and once played you cannot change it. You must play your ingredient card face down. The type of ingredient card you play can be used only for the same type on the potion card. for e.g. value on the length card matches only with the length value on the potion card. You cannot use value of a length card for the value of weight on the potion card. Closest or farthest does not mean it needs to be less than the value, it could be greater also.<br/><br/>Next, the ingredient cards are opened one at a time, starting with the first player and moving clockwise. Each player must call out the difference between the value of their ingredient card and the corresponding value on the potion card. Next is the spell round. Players will place their spell cards face down in front of them. Playing a spell card is optional. The spell cards are opened one at a time starting with the first player. Each time a spell card is opened perform the action written on it. the turn moves clockwise similar to the ingredient round. After all the spell cards are opened, the ingredient cards in front of each player are compared with their corresponding values on the potion cards. The player with the smallest difference between the ingredient value and the value on the potion card, gets the potion card. This applies to good potions and bad potions. If more than one player has the same difference, then the winner is decided by rolling the dice.<br/><br/>This ends one round of play and all the played cards are discarded. the player token is passed clockwise to the next player. Open a new potion card. If a player gets a bad potion, they cannot play a spell card in the next round. The first player to win 2 good potions, wins the game.<br/><br/>Mystic Arts is an amazing game of strategy, decision making and planning all woven together with exceptional twists. Players of all ages will relish this highly engaging and creative game. This is the perfect family entertainer which also helps acquire a plethora of essential life skills and moral values. Enjoy with your dear ones as they combine their math knowledge with exciting spells to conquer the wizarding world!<br/><br/>-description from publisher<br/><br/>",

Let's learn multiplication tables!<br/><br/>'Dice99' is a functional educational board game that you can learn easily and enjoyably by multiplying the combinations of cards you have.<br/><br/>There are two conditions to remember when creating a multiplication table.<br/><br/>The first is to create the result of multiplying the numbers in the dodecahedron.<br/>Second, you need to generate the resulting value with 2 cards of different colors.<br/><br/>Shout the multiplication table faster than anyone else, and who is the multiplication champion?<br/><br/>&lt;Purpose of the game&gt;<br/>1. You should collect the most chips.<br/><br/>&lt;Game ready&gt;<br/>1. The player deals 5 cards. The remaining cards are stacked face down and placed in the center of the table.<br/>2. Place chips and dodecahedron dice next to the deck of cards.<br/>3. Take one multiplication table and refer to it during the game.<br/><br/>&lt;Game play&gt;<br/>1. The youngest rolls the dice.<br/>(After that, the person who got the house by matching the correct answer rolls the dice.)<br/>2. Check the dice, make the multiplication table result with 2 color cards and place it on the pile where the multiplication table shouts out loud.<br/>3. If the dice side is ★, make the desired multiplication phrase result, shout the multiplication phrase aloud, and play 2 cards of different colors.<br/>4. If the die is 3579, make an odd number using two cards of different colors.<br/>5. If the dice is 2468, two cards of different colors are used to make an even number.<br/>6. The player with the first result gets 1 chip. If several people produce results at the same time, the one who gets the most takes the chips. <br/>(You can return 1 chip, discard as many cards as you like, and draw them from the pile.)<br/>7. The player with the chip replenishes 2 cards from the pile and then rolls the dice.<br/><br/>&lt;Game ends&gt;<br/>1. When all the chips are gone, the game is over, and the player with the most chips wins.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game of cards and cubes, players assume the role of entrepreneurs in the far future investing in mineral mines on the planet Mars. Various types of ore are represented by colored cubes contained in a small cloth bag called &quot;the mine.&quot; A large card represents the Ore Train with a set of ore  cubes available to all players, but players may choose to draw a random cube from the mine instead. Each player has a large card representing their own refinery which includes conveyors to process the five types of ore. Each player also has a small screen called their Warehouse, behind which they will conceal their store of refined minerals as the game goes on. There are also cards which can be drawn by the players to aid their efforts, or hinder the efforts of their competitors. On each turn, a player may draw a card (if they wish), and will select an ore cube to add to their refinery. When ore completes the refining process, the player is rewarded by special tasks or choices they can make, including playing their cards. The end game is triggered when one player has refined five &quot;rarium&quot; cubes (the most valuable of the Martian minerals). Then the winner is determined by the greatest number of refined minerals in the player's warehouse.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Instead of players trying to identify the hidden word, they have to fit words to hidden categories. The game can be played just for fun, or can be played more seriously to win or lose.<br/><br/>In Mock Word, one player is a Respondent, the other players form the Support, a co-operative team, of which one player is an Ojama. At the start of the game, the team players compose a series of words by secretly writing a single character at a time of cards. The cards get passed around, so each player contributes to forming the words. The Ojama is acting a sort of spoiler, secretly trying to make nonsense words as they form. This can produce hilarious words and makes the game a lot of fun.<br/><br/>Once the words are set, the Respondent tries to identify the theme words that fit each of the composed words. If they can, all the players score points except the Ojama. If the Respondent cannot match the words to the themes, then the Ojama scores points. At the game end, most points wins. <br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

For each building and each train you need one spray can. These then remain on the field, you have left your tag.

If the line goes out the game field, or runs into the other players line or ends in a dead end, the player must remove all his/her tiles and discard them. Then he/she must start from square one.<br/><br/>The player who gets the most bones of five, wins.<br/><br/>",

Roll the die, press the porcupine's nose that number of times, and hope his darts don't fly out. No one knows when that will happen, and the only player not to make the porcupine pop wins. Kids can switch up the gameplay and try a round where whoever makes him pop first wins. Or try a game where each dart color is assigned points and when the porcupine pops, players race to grab as many darts as they can, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Playing Time 30 - 120 Mins Recommended Age 5 and Up. Number of players required is 2 players one on one, 3players two against one or 4 players, two teams of two players in which you can communicate with your partner during your turn. In American Catur your partner and you will be taking on the roles of the government leaders (WE THE PEOPLE) who has been empowered by the Constitution to go to war, when you hear the word &lsquo;strategy&rsquo; you can picture your partner and you strategizing as the generals of the armed forces with your President in a war room looking sternly at the earth board, preparing your next best step for combat. Deciding where to engage the enemy and what maneuver are going to make sense to help achieve this goal. It will be your team strategy- to win by controlling all of the Armed Force troop&rsquo;s (Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine, Coast Guard) in a battle to force the opponent&rsquo;s President in a position of no escape, or to capture him or to eliminate him.<br/><br/>It is your tactics to consider all the factors involved and apply this knowledge of the troops strength and your team determination to make decisions that would result in controlling the center of the earth board. Each team of two begins with a total of one President and 29 troops that each player on a team shares by alternating turns. One player controls the black triangle space to travel on with their piece and the other partner controls the white triangle spaces to travel on. The other option to play is by alternating turns one player controls the area in front of them and then the other player controls the area in front of them. The line that divides the area is between the army and President. You will be alternating turns taking one action at a time over the course of setting up your strategic plans of controlling the earth board. You need to evaluate your earth board during each move. It will help you keep tracked of all projectile chips used and all troops&rsquo; movements.<br/><br/>This earth board is your map where you need to go, and what you have to conquer. And around the perimeter of the earth board, you have two rows to have the ability to launch your offensive or defensive attack with projectile chips by rolling the dice to capture, eliminate pieces or use the chips as an obstacle for your opponent&rsquo;s pieces to go around. Beware that sometimes a roll of a launch can become a misfire that captures or eliminates your own pieces. The winner is the one who forces the President in a position of no escape(DEFCON1), or eliminates him with a projectile chip. There is one more major part of the game if the President is in checkmate or stalemate, we go into DEFCON 1 in which all unused projectile chips are launched alternating turns to see how the game unfolds.<br/><br/>Both sides White/Black are equipped with four types of projectile chips; 16 poison gas that captures one-piece that travels on the triangle space, 8 biological gas that can with one strike captures up to two-pieces that travels on the square space and 16 atomic nukes that eliminates one-piece that travels on the triangle space, 8 hydrogen nukes that can with one strike eliminate up to two-pieces that travels on the square space. If you can&rsquo;t determine a winner after exhausting all the launching of the projectile chips at the end of the game the President that is in checkmate loses, if it is a stalemate then count the total points of just captured (POW)pieces to find out the winner of the game. Do Not count the pieces that were eliminated or on the board. There are no draws.

He earns material tokens he will need for his expedition and places them on his route plan.<br/>2.The expeditions.<br/>We mix the &quot;panoramas&quot;, &quot;jokers&quot; and &quot;stop&quot; cards. each player draws 8 cards at random. The rest is the pickaxe. Each player will then seek to obtain the 8 panorama cards of his expedition by asking for them from his opponents or by iterating them in the deck. Progress is indicated in pencil on the route plan. During the game, players will have to answer general knowledge questions about the poles and thus earn points. The player who completes his expedition first earns 500 bonus points.<br/><br/>The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.<br/><br/>",

The inspiration for the game comes from the comic &quot;Warning Label&quot;, by Thom Zahler.  In the series, the protagonist Danielle pitches a card game where players create their own comic convention and play against other convention promoters.<br/><br/>In The Long Con, players use pairs of guest and event cards to earn money or build their audience.  Money lets players add additional cards to their decks, while a bigger audience will upgrade their venue and ultimately win them the game.  The guests and events players can add to their decks give them more powerful combinations and unique bonuses.  In the end, the combinations of cards each player plays tell a fun, colorful story of how their convention grew into the ultimate con.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

He repeats the process by drawing an action card and turning the spinner again, which determines the action to be mimed (for example: THE LION PAINTS).<br/>At this point he proceeds with the mime (one or two minutes of time can be set, at the competitors' choice).<br/>The game stops either at the end of the time or when a contestant guesses both the subject and the action he is performing.

Your batter&rsquo;s a weak hitter. Will you try the squeeze anyway &ndash; or let him swing away? Will you hold your runner at third except for a hit or error? The game is on the line&hellip;. What will you do?<br/><br/>Major league baseball is the most popular summer sport in the USA, with a fan base of many millions. D20 Baseball is a card (and dice) driven simulation of the game, playable in about an hour. It&rsquo;s based on current statistics, and will delight fans with realistic play and accurate results. No teams, so it's just you against your opponent on equal terms.<br/><br/>During the game, players select a card from their hands for each batter&rsquo;s plate appearance, sometimes face up, sometimes face down. When revealed, only one of the cards will be used to determine the outcome: hit, walk, out, etc. A D20 (20-sided die) is often used to select one of multiple results on a card. The two played cards can also determine which player must play his or her card face up for the next plate appearance.<br/><br/>D20 Baseball  follows all rules and tactics of major league baseball, and includes sacrifices, squeeze plays, stolen bases, stretching for an extra base, playing the infield in, and so forth. Unlike other boardgames where the dice-rolling becomes tedious, in D20 Baseball you&rsquo;ll feel tension from the card play &ndash; and that you&rsquo;ve actually been in a real game after nine innings. Highly portable and easy to play, D20 Baseball is sure to please baseball aficionados of all ages.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer'<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A fast and fun language party game for everyone: combine words from the same field or make new and original connections.  <br/>Who is left with no cards in hand?<br/><br/>To understand how it works, you need to analyze how a card is built. Each of them, except for special cases, shows a colored (main) word and its hyphenation in the center. At the top, in the corners, a syllable that forms the word, while at the bottom, smaller, another (secondary) word of another color. The colors of the words depend on their category.<br/><br/>Each player receives 10 cards which he keeps face up in front of him, while the draw pile and discard pile are on the appropriate board. Jokers are split equally between each player. The aim is to run out of cards first by trying to add cards to the discard pile.<br/><br/>To discard a card from your hand, the color of the main word must be the same as that of the last card in the discard pile.  It can also be the same as the smallest word at the bottom (secondary), but in this case the link between the main and secondary words must be explained. Or the card you want to play has the same syllable as the last of the discards. If you play a Joker, you can create a word using the syllables of your cards with that of the discarded ones. If you fail, you have to fish.<br/><br/>",

In this 2 player game, you play as either Red or the Wolf, and then switch roles to play again.<br/><br/>The Red player draws 3 cards a turn and places them in an expanding grid with new cards touching an old card orthogonally.<br/><br/>The Wolf player moves one space a turn orthogonally or diagonally trying to &quot;eat&quot; any &quot;Red&quot; card by entering that card's space.<br/><br/>The match ends when the deck is exhausted or the Wolf is surrounded on all sides and plays a &quot;Red&quot; card on top of the Wolf.<br/><br/>Then players switch roles and play another match.  The winner is the wolf who eats the most &quot;Red&quot; cards.<br/><br/>",

The discs are hollow cardboard rings that are red on one side and blue on the other.<br/><br/>The game has two modes: a &quot;reflexes&quot; real-time game and a &quot;thinking&quot; game.  In both, players use a deck of number cards to generate multiplication products that determines where the player puts a disc in a 6x6 grid of numbers.<br/><br/>In both games, the first player to get 6 in a row wins; if neither player achieves this when the cards run out, the player with more of their discs on the board wins.<br/><br/>The game includes a few variants, including one that adds Othello/Reversi rules.<br/><br/>",

Then they must ask any player for a number and type of card, seeking to build a set of 4 with the ones he already owns.<br/><br/>Now, the player who was asked has two options:<br/><br/>     If he possesses one or more of that number and type, he must give it to him.<br/>     If he does not have any cards of the type sought, he must answer: Fly!<br/><br/><br/>The requesting player will then remove a card from the garden.<br/><br/>     If the card obtained from the garden matches the one you requested earlier, you must show it to the rest of the players and you can continue asking the others.<br/>     If it does not match, it will be the turn of the player to his right.<br/><br/><br/>When a player gathers 3 cards of the same type and number, he will place them face up to one side. The game ends with the first player who manages to play all their cards.<br/><br/>The player who has managed to form the most groups wins.<br/><br/><br/>Color Miel<br/><br/>Immerse yourself in the universe of bees, where order and work are the fundamental tools to achieve the best and richest honey. Among flowers and beehives, you must be attentive to the numbers and colors to build your game. Use the speed and agility of the bees to lower all your cards and thus win the game.<br/><br/>Deal 14 cards to each player. The first player  takes a card from the deck and adds it to the ones he has.<br/><br/>They can now:<br/><br/>     If they have the Queen, you must lower her immediately and place her in the middle. Take another card from the pot.<br/>     If the Queen is not lowered, you cannot go down beehive games or honey ladder, but you can go down a bouquet or flower ladder.<br/>    If you can't do any of the above, you must pass.<br/><br/><br/>The next player on the right follows, always taking a card from the pot and placing it next to their cards. On their turn, the player is entitled to perform any of the actions above or:<br/><br/>     Add a letter or more to a ladder, or complete a bouquet or beehive on the table.<br/>     Draw a card from a game for another player that does not make it lose its status as a bouquet, hive or ladder, and use the drawn card to open a new game.<br/><br/><br/>The game ends when one of the players closes by lowering all his cards.

        "description": "One of the most important manufacturing worlds in the Inner Sphere, Hesperus II was a primary objective of the Word of Blake's Operation STEEL HAMMER. The plan was designed to disrupt the Lyran Alliance's economic and industrial base. Long before attempting to seize Hesperus II, the Word concocted a lengthy invasion plan to weaken Lyran defenses. The Blakists aimed to succeed where other invaders had failed.<br/>Jihad Turning Points: Hesperus II fleshes out all the details of the conflict surrounding this pivotal world published in various Jihad Plot Sourcebooks. Additionally, players can join one of the myriad of units fighting for ultimate control of one of the Inner Sphere's best-known factory worlds.<br/><br/>This campaign series uses the Chaos Campaign rules and gives players the option of fighting individual battles, following a campaign arc, inserting it into their own campaigns, and even creating their own scenarios with optional rules to give their games a &quot;Hesperan flavor.&quot; This PDF-exclusive book includes a detailed map of Hesperus II, a comprehensive list of the forces involved on Hesperus II during its brief occupation, and several Tracks for players can use to run simple lance-on-lance battles or stage a complete world-wide invasion. The only limit is the players' imagination.<br/><br/>",

Stardust Catches the Carnivores is a new special edition of the award-winning Go Extinct! tabletop card game, incorporating artwork and concepts from the Stardust series of science books for young readers.<br/><br/>Players complete sets of animals based on actual genetic clades, working to collect the most sets by inferring the other player&rsquo;s cards and identifying common ancestors on the evolutionary tree. By the end, players will deeply understand the amazing fact that every carnivoran alive today &mdash; from the house cat to the polar bear &mdash; descended from a single prehistoric ancestor, the miacid!<br/><br/>Based loosely on Go Fish, the goal is for players to collect as many sets of closely related animals as possible. The sets are &quot;clades&quot; of closely-related animals on the evolutionary tree board, which players use for reference. Players take turns asking another player for cards, and if they do not have a matching card, they say &quot;Go Extinct!&quot;. The gameplay is more strategic than Go Fish because players can ask either for a specific card or a matching card at any level of the tree hierarchy, thus trading off the specificity of the result for the likelihood of a match.<br/><br/>",

In head-to-head mode, two players or two teams are simultaneously trying to break the code of the other player/team. Each player/team has a Tech Deck. Each player/team serves as the codemaster for the other player/team. Players make an educated guess using their Tech Deck cards. Cards placed as a guess are called guess cards. After making a guess, the codemaster rotates the guess cards to provide information about the secret code for each of the guess cards in their positions of the code. A guess card can be an exact match, value match, displaced, or absent. <br/>WINNING &ndash; In cooperative mode, the players win by guessing the values of each of the positions of the secret code. In head-to-head mode, a player/team wins if they guess the exact cards (value and domain/suit) of the secret code. If after 7 turns, neither player/team has guessed the code they are awarded points based on how close to the secret code they are.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The result of these efforts and collective insanity was a new addition to the game &quot;Cards of Conflict&quot;, which the publishers affectionately called &quot;The Collection of Your Stupid Ideas.&quot; Each card is not only very dumb, but also unique! The addon came out, as they say, unrealistically cool and does not repeat any of the games in the series. It can be played on its own or with other games in the series. In the set you will find 30 cards with questions and 150 with answers.<br/><br/>JOKES FOR THREE HUNDRED OR LEARN TO PLAY A TRACTOR OPERATOR<br/><br/>If you joked so that you forgot how to play, then we will remind you. If this does not help, please see a doctor as soon as possible. So, each participant receives 10 white as snow or what you can joke about in this game, cards with answers. A deck of black (no, we are not racists!) cards with questions is laid out in the center of the table. The first player, known in a friendly way as &quot;card bro&quot; or worse in some companies, takes the top card of the black deck and reads the question aloud. The rest of the players must choose the most ridiculous, as they think, answer and lay out one of their cards. Bro repeats the question one more time, and then reads out the answers of the participants.<br/><br/>The author of the funniest answer gets a victory point. Players take one white card into their hand and the next player draws a question. The carousel of select toilet humor begins to rotate with renewed vigor. The winner is the one who scores the maximum number of points.<br/><br/>",

The player taking on the role of the clairvoyant in a turn chooses a difficulty of card and attempts to describe a location to the FBI agents.<br/><br/>The FBI agents each get one guess for the location and once they choose a location, they cannot move it and a second player cannot guess the same space.

In the &quot;matchmaker&quot; the players have to look carefully what the dwellers of the forest are doing.<br/>This fun card game helps to identify different concepts, improving association skills.<br/>The players draw a card and put it next to each other.

        "description": "Armoured Storm: The Desert War is a quick-playing, simple-to-learn game of tank-versus-tank combat in World War Two. The rules are intended for battles between 15 and 30 tanks per side, plus 4 or 5 HQ tanks. This means, in game terms, that each player will command one or more companies of tanks organized into several platoons.<br/><br/>In Armoured Storm, you take the role of a commander first and a gunner/driver second. Your ability to give the right orders at the right time and bring your available firepower to bear more efficiently than your opponent, are more important at the level of command you&rsquo;re representing. Out-thinking your opponent by being clear about your goals and through clever use of the Tactics Chart will bring you success.<br/>Armoured Storm is in part inspired by the historical armoured battles of the Desert War &ndash; there are some excellent first-hand accounts of this &ndash; but also by the gung-ho action encountered in British and American comics.<br/><br/>THE &lsquo;YOU COMMAND&rsquo; SERIES<br/>&lsquo;You Command&rsquo; is a series of light wargames by Daniel Mersey. When you play a &lsquo;You Command&rsquo; game, your goal is to defeat your opponent by out-thinking them tactically using the innovative Tactics Chart, and then by out-fighting their model army on the tabletop battlefield.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the designer<br/><br/>",

The second is the player on the side of the prison.<br/><br/>The game consists of 10 rounds. Each round consists of a basic movement of prisoner tokens (first camp) and penitentiary tokens (second camp) in areas on the main board to collect items tokens or to make it difficult to collect it.Additionally, both camps have the option of placing a special prisoner card (first camp) and a penitentiary card (second camp) in most rounds, which strengthen the effects of tokens when collecting item tokens or making it difficult to collect them.<br/><br/>In addition, in some rounds there are some extra functions, such as the necessity to provide information by the prisoners' camp to the opponent how much has been collected for the plan at a given moment, or the possibility of exchanging the collected item tokens from the main board for those needed for a specific escape plan from outside the board etc.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, the first camp draws the escaping prisoner card (1, 2 or 3 escaping cards) and additional suspect prisoner cards. He/They also draws an escape plan card that shows which item tokens he/they must collect for the plan. The second camp sees all these cards, but doesn't know who is escaping and with what plan.<br/><br/>The goal of the game for the first camp is to collect all items for the plan within 10 rounds for the appropriate prisoners or a special field on the main board in such a way that the second camp does not guess who is escaping and how. The object of the game for the second camp is to guess these unknowns within 10 rounds.<br/>The game may end with a victory for one of the camps but there also can be a draw.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

Each board has spaces for 4 servings each of Fruit &amp; Vegetables, Bread &amp; Cereal, and Dairy, and 2 spaces each for Meat and Bonus items. On turn, spin the spinner then draw a card from the food group matching the color spun and decide if you want to buy it. If you don&rsquo;t buy it, return it to the bottom of the deck. If you buy it, draw a Pot Luck card and pay the price for the item as det by the item card and Pot Luck card then discard the Pot Luck card and place the item on its matching space on your checkout counter. If all such spaces are filled, you may place the card on a Bonus Item space or hold it to trade or sell. In lieu of drawing a card, you may use your turn to sell or trade a food card to another player for food or money. If a player makes an incorrect challenge, any other player may challenge them. The person who was wrong (the player or the challenger) must pay the bank the correct amount without receiving a card. Game ends when a player fills their checkout counter entirely. That player gets a 100-point bonus. Players then score 25 points for each item on their counter and 1 point for each penny not spent. High score wins. As a variant, deal each P a People card at the start of the game. Each card shows a calorie target. During scoring, subtract one point for each calorie above or below the target.<br/><br/>",

It has a day and night phase, and the players must deduce who the murderer might be, but is not run by a player and the culprit is not actually known until the end of the game.<br/><br/>Nakayoshi is a peaceful little village, and everybody shares everything. Their belongings, their family, even their destiny. But one morning, a body is found, clearly murdered. And suddenly a detective arrives in the village to interrogate all the suspects. Can the murderer be found, or will they escape justice?<br/><br/>The game has only 14 cards, which are shuffled, and a card dealt face-down in front of each player. In the day phase, the players can look at the card dealt to them in secret and discuss the situation. At night, the night-crawler phase occurs. Each player closes their eyes, and in turn, one player may open their eyes and examine one card to the left or right of them, and may, or may not, swap the cards or make it sound is if they have. When all the players have had their own night-crawl, the next day begins and the players can again look at their card and discuss things.<br/><br/>At the end of the game, the culprit is the player with the highest total value of cards against them, being the card in front and to the left and right of them. The cards are things such as murder weapons, or motives such as passion.<br/><br/>If the villagers can identify the culprit at the end of the game, they win. If the culprit is not found, the culprit wins. But the actual culprit is not resolved until the final reveal. By moving cards between one another, players might draw attention to themselves, but might also deduce who is the real culprit.<br/><br/>The game is designed for 3 to 7 players normally, but with 2 player rules too. the designer suggests that the unused cards could be made open to players if they wanted extra information.<br/>user summary<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In this game for young kids (and their grown ups) the players are each one of the Paw Patrol pups. Specifically, these are the &quot;Mighty Pups&quot; super powered version of the Paw Patrol. The setting is a path through Adventure Bay. The goal is to rescue the most animals along the way. When all players have reached the end of the path, the player who rescued the most animals is the winner.<br/><br/>This game is intended for younger kids, so each player in turn spins a spinner to see how far they move along the path. The only decision is whether to take a side path or stay on the main path when reaching one of two forks in the path.<br/><br/>The players don't actually have individual powers, other than when they have mighty Chase in front of them. That player is allowed to ignore backward move spaces and avoid loss of tokens that represent rescued animals. A player gets him when the spinner lands within Chase's arc.<br/><br/>The winner is frequently not the player who reached the path end first. Kids who are behind on the path often rescue more animals and can pull ahead for the victory.<br/><br/>",

It adds a real level of tension and excitement to the battles. Everything matters.<br/><br/>The new Sidekick Mechanic makes for new character customization and powers!<br/><br/>The battles are a series of one-on-one fights to the death. You either kill the monster earning coins and XP or your character dies and you must chug your drink!<br/><br/>The cards act as the GM (So everyone can drink) and the heroes go through four themed quests in each game - each getting progressively difficult and more likely to drink. However as this is a light RPG and a light Drinking Game there is a one chug per quest maximum which prevents Drinking Quest from being a &quot;Pass out in 10 minutes&quot; kind of drinking game. Over the course of 2 or 3 hours, a typical game averages 2 or 3 chugs.<br/><br/>Whoever gets the most XP wins! Whoever loses had to chug the most so it's sort of like everybody wins.<br/><br/>",

Make sure to handle &quot;Task chips&quot; well to advance  the &quot;Cat pawn&quot; so that you do not have too many &quot;Task chips&quot; left over  at the end of the weekends!<br/>Score Calculation: The score will be calculated twice. Once on the first weekend (after 5 tricks) and once on the second weekend (after 10 tricks).<br/>Scores are given minus points according to the color and number of  &quot;Task chips&quot; each player has. Scores are listed on the &quot;Count card&quot;.<br/>Winner: At the end of the game, the player with the least minus points wins the game/<br/><br/>",

Change the landscape and stun your opponent with brilliant tactics. Unleash new devastating magic upon the enemy&rsquo;s forces. Empower your economy to overwhelm your foe and strangle your opponent for resources. Be clever, deceitful, and predict your foe.<br/><br/>One of the fundamental changes implemented in Legends of Signum II: Warseer is the introduction of the Hexagon Grid.<br/><br/>In the previous versions of Signum players had to use various in-game rulers to measure distances. Now all units are placed in special hexagon tiles with each tile having its own landscape feature and effects. Aside from the undisputed fact that the hexagon is the bestagon, this immensely simplifies measuring movement and shooting range, and gives the game a much more organic and intuitive feel.<br/><br/>Combat mechanics have been simplified and made more straightforward.<br/><br/>All units are now available in your camp at the start of the game and can be brought out into the battlefield as needed. While in past, players would get their cards at random, you can now properly plan out your strategy and move to counter the enemy. In addition, only the attacking player has to roll dice now. This has removed an element many considered redundant, simplifying gameplay considerably.<br/><br/>The economy has been completely revamped, changing the way profit is accumulated and making tactic cards free.<br/><br/>Whereas in the previous versions of Signum, profit per turn was always a fixed amount, now your destroyed and used cards increase your income, making the game even more dynamic and intense as it progresses. Your tactic cards are now free, and the enemy won&rsquo;t be able to find out what you&rsquo;ve prepared, adding an additional layer of tension to the gameplay.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Now it is up to each player to match their cards (consisting of eleven suits) against the suits shown by the dice as quickly as possible. You play a card and take matching dice and place them on the card. After all the dice have been collected, they are rolled again and a new round starts.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player plays their last card from their hand or when a dice is not picked, because none of the players has a card with that colour on it. The winner is the player who played the last card or the player with most collected cards if the game ends because no one could take any dice.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In World Explorer the Boardgame, players try to score points by carrying out classic expeditions, make scientific discoveries or simply travel to iconic locations around the world. In order to do any of those things each player needs to gather resources of different kinds, numbers, and combinations. Resources for expeditions and scientific research includes knowledge &amp; ability, bravery, and financing. To travel you only need the combined resources of an airplane ticket and spending-money. The resources are collected by rolling the two dice. The more combined dots on the dice, the more resources you get to collect.<br/>The game includes a board with a map of the world, seven types of cards (the various resources, the different assignments, &quot;change of circumstance-cards&quot;) and game-pieces to mark the explored sections. The cards are sorted in to the seven different categories, shuffled and placed beside the board with the backside up. The players therefore don&rsquo;t know for instance what particular resource, expedition, travel-destination etc they are going to collect, just the type of card. To determine who gets to start the game, the dice are rolled. The player with the highest combined dots on the dice becomes start player and the rest follow clockwise. Based on the number of dots in this first dice roll all players also get to collect resources or buy any other type of card or combination of cards that the number of combined dots will allow. And then the game begins.<br/>On each turn the active player starts by rolling the dice. As in the starting round the player then gets to buy resources or other cards, based on the number of combined dots. The cards vary in cost between 3-8 dots. This means that if a player rolls a 2 combined, he/she doesn't get to collect any cards, but can still take other kinds of action in the turn, if possible. If a player rolls a 7, he/she are not allowed to collect any cards and are also forbidden to act in any other way in the actual turn. In this case all other players get to collect a card with a max value of 4. On each turn the active player, besides from rolling the dice and collecting resources or other cards, can carry out an expedition, make a scientific discovery or travel to a location (or any two or three of these actions combined), if the player has collected the proper cards and resources to do so. The player can also play a &quot;changed circumstance-card&quot;, to either gain personal advantages or create trouble for the other players. The active player can also initiate trading with one or more of the other players. When the player has done all he/she can or wants to do, the turn goes on to the next player.<br/>The game is typically divided in to three phases. In the first phase the players often gather resources and other cards to keep the number of possibilities of strategic choices for the rest of the game open. In the second phase the exploring gets more intense as the players start using their collected cards more actively. The points start to roll in and the map gets filled with game-pieces. In the third phase - the &quot;end game&quot; - players often tries to score easy points by travelling or to collect some of the extra points, in order to gain the final necessary points to win. At this stage many of the &quot;changed circumstance-cards&quot; are likely to have been played, which often makes it more difficult for one or more of the players. Points are scored by completing the expeditions, scientific discoveries or by travelling. The points scored on the expeditions vary based on difficulty - the harder to achieve the more points a player scores. And as in the old days of exploration you must get there first, as there are two each of the expedition cards! Any player that manages to make scientific discoveries in all the four different areas gets 5 extra points. Likewise, any player who manages to travel to all five continents gets 5 extra points. The game ends when a player has gathered 40 points.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Arena of Mages is the first installment in a series of games released by Tehnolog.  It was released in 2001 in two large, boxed sets, along with 10 supplements.<br/><br/>The first boxed version included: <br/>-a playing field (made up of 4 sections)<br/>-12 standee markers<br/>-2 player aids<br/>-72 soldier cards <br/>-48 artifact cards <br/>-18 event markers <br/>-2 game dice <br/>-rules<br/><br/>The rules of the larger boxed version were slightly different from the rules of the game of the smaller version.  However,<br/>the cards (soldiers and artifacts) of the different sets were compatible with one another, and players had the opportunity to assemble their own, invincible armies.<br/><br/>Fans of the Fantasy Battles game system will recognize the characters on the cards from the units of the Fantasy Battle system. Each of them has its own name or nickname.<br/><br/>The rules of the boxed version are based on the confrontation of squads from two players (no more than six squads on each side). One soldier from each squad can be on the field at the same time. Each player's turn consists of four phases:<br/><br/>1. Preliminary phase - introducing new fighters into the game, equipping fighters with artifacts.<br/>2. Maneuver phase - movement of fighters on the field.<br/>3.

        "description": "An exciting card game for all secret agents!  Covert mission is perfect for all fans of strategy games.  What's special: There are only zeros and ones cards.  On secret missions you have to keep your own cards hidden, while in nasty counter-missions cards from other players can be stolen.  The simple rules ensure a quick start to the game and let the game evening begin without complicated game rules!<br/><br/>Here's how it's played:<br/><br/>     There are only two different cards in the entire game: 0 and 1<br/>     All players try to play certain combinations from these cards in front of them and thus win the game.  Multiple strategies lead to victory.<br/>     If it is your turn, you may play a card from your hand face down in your display or reveal a card in your own display and try to steal a face down card in someone else's display.  But beware!  If you steal a 0, you have to pay dearly for it.<br/>     The first person to reveal three more 1s than everyone else wins - unless someone else can steal the victory by revealing five 0s in their own display one after the other.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher (translated)<br/><br/>Ein spannendes Kartenspiel f&uuml;r alle Geheimagent*innen!

Auf geheimer Mission gilt es, die eigenen Karten verdeckt zu halten, w&auml;hrend in fiesen Gegenmissionen Karten von anderen Spieler*innen geklaut werden k&ouml;nnen. Die simplen Regeln sorgen f&uuml;r einen schnellen Spieleinstieg und lassen den Spieleabend ohne komplizierte Spielregeln beginnen!<br/><br/>So wird's gespielt:<br/><br/>     Im ganzen Spiel gibt es nur zwei unterschiedliche Karten: 0 und 1<br/>     Alle Spieler*innen versuchen, aus diesen Karten bestimmte Kombinationen vor sich auszuspieeln und so das Spiel zu gewinnen. Mehrere Strategien f&uuml;hren zum Sieg.<br/>     Wer am Zug ist, darf eine Handkarte verdeckt in seine Auslage ausspielen oder eine Karte in der eigenen Auslage aufdecken und versuchen, eine verdeckte Karte in einer fremden Auslage zu klauen. Aber Vorsicht! Klaut man eine 0, muss man teuer daf&uuml;r bezahlen.<br/>     Wer zuerst drei 1en mehr aufgedeckt hat als alle anderen, gewinnt - es sei denn, jemand anders kann den Sieg stibitzen, indem sie*er nacheinander f&uuml;nf 0en in der eigenen Auslage aufdeckt.<br/><br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

A spinner is used as a substitute for a 6-sided die to determine how many spaces the moving side may travel in a turn. The players on the puck-carrying team must skate in straight lines and must make at least one pass every turn, while the opposing team's players may change their direction of movement while moving.<br/><br/>Some unusual elements are also introduced, however: anytime a team wishes to attempt a shot on goal, a puck-firing device is used by the shooting team, thus an element of dexterity is involved in this game. Also, optionally, players can play the game as a trivia game, wherein on each turn, the puck-carrying player must answer a hockey-themed trivia question from a provided question booklet, or he forfeits control of the puck.<br/><br/>",

Set in a world of fantasy, Coulin features dice with sides like the Crown, the Skull, the Eye or the Wall. Each of them allow you to perform one different action. Choose wisely!<br/><br/>When a turn begins, choose any amount of dice among those you own and roll them. Then, choose an action among the ones availables (depending on your dice roll) and perform it. You can steal dice from other players, protect your own, lose some... If a player owns every die in a given turn, he or she wins the game. If no one reaches this condition after 10 turns, the player with the most amount of dice wins.<br/><br/>",

The game is set on the year 1452, when some remained loyal to the king while others took the side of the ambitious usurper. Which side are you on? And who will prevail?<br/><br/>There are 32 cards that represent various characters. Most of the cards have numeric values on them: 1 King; 1 Grand Prince [0]; 4 Bandits; 2 Queens [9]; 2 Ministers [8]; 2 Councilors [7]; 2 Generals [6]; 2 Eunuchs [5]; 2 Ambassadors [4]; 6 Prefects [3]; 6 Policemen [2]; and 2 Clowns [1].<br/><br/>At the beginning of the game, all cards are dealt to the players. (In a 3-player game, the dealer receives one less.) The player with the Grand Prince reveals it. On his/her turn, the player can either (1) play a set of two identical cards and use its special ability or (2) attempt to steal a card from another player.<br/><br/>If a player revealed the Grand Prince, his/her winning condition is to have the King and three cards out of the Queens, Ministers, and Councilors. For other players, the winning condition is to have the King card only (and nothing else) in his/her hand.<br/><br/>The overall flow is simple enough, but the special powers of the cards make the game more tactical than it appears.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "World Cup is a soccer game which is played in 2 phases, the arrangement of the teams phase and the soccer match phase.<br/><br/>There are 32 soccer player cards in 4 colors, as well as 12 Superstar cards and 12 Fan cards included. Each player is dealt 4 soccer player card, 1 of each color, and some money.<br/><br/>During Phase-1, the players walk around a 16 space course, spend money for soccer player cards, superstars and fan cards. They also need money to make transfers with other players or to replace soccer players, which have been hurt by injuries. The strength of all teams is always kept up-to-date, because the income depends directly on it!<br/>As soon as all soccer playing cards are sold, Phase-1 ends and players with incomplete teams pay for making up their teams again. If they don't have enough money, they get the worst available cards.<br/><br/>Phase-2 is the match phase (money does not help here anymore): <br/>The matches are played on a 7x13 playing field. Each team has 3 tokens which merely serve as defenders. The ball is moved by putting cards on the table. The attacker must announce, which card(s) he wants to play and the defender can then arrange his tokens according to certain restrictions. Goals can only be realized by Superstars - but there are 12 in this game, so most matches will end with a winner. A match is finished, when one player has played all his cards.<br/><br/>All succeeding matches must be played with the same deck of cards, so it's clear, that Phase-1 is most important to become the final World Cup Winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "from the Box for the Tee Pee Toys version: All the Thrills of a Big Game: Running Plays, Passing Plays, Kick-Offs, Punts, Field Goals, Punt Returns.You are the Quarterback! Choose your own Plays! Follow the rules of football. Players each roll dice, the numbers on the dice refer to sequence tables which determine the results of the play (one player rolls for offense, and the other rolls for defense). Before rolling the offensive player must state whether he is going to run, kick, or pass. The game consists of &quot;Four Quarters&quot; four sets of (20) plays each quarter. The player with the highest score at the end wins.<br/><br/>Alternate version: Jr. Quarterback came with short game board, markers for downs and quarter of play, a cardboard football and a deck of 20 cards with plays. One quarter of play was one complete pass through the 20 plays card deck. Thus, the deck would be gone through twice per half and 4 times to complete one game. The offensive player would select a play. The card would be turned over to reveal the results. Following the rules of football i.e., 4 downs to gain 10 yards, 4 quarters of play, etc.) the ball would move up and down the field based on the play called and the associated gain or loss in yardage on the card associated with the play called. The plays that could be called were &quot;left end&quot;, &quot;left tackle&quot;, &quot;left guard&quot;, &quot;right end&quot;, &quot;right tackle&quot;, &quot;right guard&quot;, &quot;short pass&quot; and &quot;long pass&quot; as well as &quot;punt&quot;, &quot;kickoff&quot; and &quot;field goal&quot;. Each of the running plays had gains and losses as well as one fumble and a no gain. &quot;Long pass&quot; had four interceptions including one that was returned for a touchdown. &quot;Long pass&quot; also offered a touchdown. Short pass had a higher completion rate than long pass and only two interceptions. Jr. Quarterback is a fun game for two young players and can even be played by one. In my opinion ages elementary or for the adult who likes old school board games from a simpler time. Great game for teaching a young child the basics.<br/><br/>",

They each take turns placing the pieces, with their colour exposed, on the game board. The objective is to surround one or more of your opponents pieces with your own. Pieces are considered surrounded when all outside edges of one or a group of pieces are bordered by the other colour. When completely surrounded, pieces are turned over to show the opposite colour.<br/><br/>When all pieces are placed on the board, players take turns moving one piece each to one adjacent space. A space is considered adjacent if it could be considered part of the same &quot;pie&quot;.<br/><br/>Special consideration must also be given to the edge of the board where there are circles that simulate a red piece, while blank edges simulate a white piece.<br/><br/>The game ends when one player has only 2 pieces remaining or a player cannot move. The player with the most pieces is the victor.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "It's 1878, and All Fathomed Out pits 3-6 players against each other in a race to discover and catalogue the most noteworthy new species brought up from the uncharted waters of the South Pacific.  These moustachioed men of science face not only stiff competition from their fellow explorers as they dive (only one man can take credit for discovering each species, after all, and science waits for no one) but also the multitudinous natural dangers and perilous creatures that lurk in the briny deeps.<br/><br/>As you explore the beautiful hex-based ocean you'll uncover aquatic species ripe for the cataloguing, environmental events both fair and foul, and underhanded shenanigans the unscrupulous can use to tip the balance in their favour (the scallywags!).<br/><br/>How to Play:<br/><br/>In All Fathomed Out, the goal is to amass the most impressive collection of previously unknown aquatic species as you possibly can before your competitors beat you to it.  You'd best hurry though, for only the first specimen of a given species is worth academic accolades and can be catalogued; the rest are old news best used for bait!<br/><br/>Each turn you move across the ocean floor, flipping over new tiles as you venture forth into the unknown or hustling over previously mapped areas on your way back to the ship to drop off your catch or in search of better hunting grounds.  Be careful about wandering too far, though, as the air hose connecting you to the ship and all that sweet, sweet oxygen is only so long and it'd be a real shame if the ship got hit by a sudden typhoon and was sent careening away...<br/><br/>Exploring a new tile nets you a number of cards (listed on the tile itself) from the game's four decks that could be the specimens you're looking to collect, environmental events that shake the game up, or shenanigans that you can use against other players (or keep for later).  You've only got so much space, though, so at the end of your turn you can only keep two cards.   Choose carefully!<br/><br/>Once one player catalogues five fish or the ocean is completely explored, the game is over and the player with the most impressive haul (determined by adding together the publication points from each specimen they have catalogued) wins!<br/><br/>",

The cards are like standard baseball cards, but have four trivia questions on the back, labeled single, double, triple, and home run.  The game proceeds like a game of baseball, but to determine the result of an at bat, the batter spins a spinner, which would say out, or one of the four hits.  If they spun a hit, they would have to answer the question on the back of the cards to see if they got the hit.  As with real baseball, there are three outs to an inning, and 9 innings.  The player who ends with the most runs wins.<br/><br/>",

Each player receives six cards numbered from one to ten in each of three colors. Remaining cards form a face-down draw pile and one is turned over to start the discard pile. On each turn, a player matches a card from his hand to the top card of the discard pile in either the number or the color. This card is placed on the discard pile. If unable to make a match, the player has to take a card from the draw pile. Countdown cards signal a frantic attempt to be the first to match the number that is counted down from ten. The player who started the countdown draws a new Mission Statement (e.g., &quot;When you play an odd card, say &quot;That's odd.&quot;). Failing to take the action dictated by the Mission Statement results in having to pick up a penalty of four cards.<br/><br/>",

This player wants to off as many other players as possible before someone catches his murderous wink and accuses him of the crimes.<br/><br/>In Eye for an Eye, the players belong to a group of priests in Britannia known as the Ovates. From the rules: &quot;It is the dream of every Ovate to become a Druid, but the test is a terrible one requiring courage,intelligence and stamina.&quot; One to three Druids hide among the group of Ovates, and they can hypnotize an Ovate by winking at that players. The Druids don't know one another's identities, but if one Druid winks at another, the wink has no effect. The game ends when either only one Ovate remains unhypnotized (this player being the game's loser for failing to detect any Druids after so much opportunity) or an Ovate accuses someone of being a Druid (in which one or the other player is the game's loser). The loser must then perform the tests chosen by players at the start of the game from the included deck of 34 tests, with the test categories being &quot;Gallantry&quot;, &quot;Find Out About Me&quot;, &quot;Don't Be Shy&quot; and &quot;Surprise&quot;.<br/><br/>The Austrlian Wink Death features a more traditional approach to the party game, with one player being the winker and up to 32 others being the winkees. The murder victims die in the manner depicted on their character card. Any player can accuse another of being the winker, but should the accusation prove incorrect, then both players are out and the game continues. Wink Death includes rules for three other games that use the same deck of cards.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game has been developed for a dutch railway maintainer called Prorail by Identity Games International B.V., Rotterdam, the Netherlands.<br/><br/>You have to collect six cities with six different colours. You can try to collect them yourself, try to block your opponents, remove blocks that your opponents have put on you and be extremely lucky to get all different colours.<br/><br/>Box contents<br/>- 1 manual<br/>- 1 folded gameboard (folded 6 squares)<br/>- 6 player cards<br/>- 36 city cards<br/>- 24 obstruction cards<br/>- 36 city markers (in 6 colors)<br/>- 12 obstruction markers<br/>- 6 train pawns<br/>- 1 custom dice (4 green + 2 red dots)<br/><br/>Purpose of the game:<br/>Each player attempts to collect 1 city marker of every color. The first to succeed, wins the game.<br/><br/>Quick game overview:<br/>On their turn, players throw the dice and, depending on the color of the dot, act out their options.<br/>- Getting a green dot allows the player take two action. They can move their train either 1 or 2 steps, each step counting as 1 action. They can also turn the train around, which also costs 1 action. A green dot can therefor be used for: 2 steps OR 1 turn + 1 step (making the turn first). After moving their train, players must draw an action card and do what it says. After this, the turn passes to the next player.<br/>- Getting a red dot stop the player from both moving and turning, they also cannot draw an action card. Instead, a player throwing a red dot may draw an obstruction card. They may either play it immediately, or keep it for later. However, any one player may only have up to 3 obstruction cards. Throwing a red dot and having 3 obstruction cards already means drawing a new card and performing one of the four cards.<br/><br/>Game setup:<br/>All city markers are placed on the cities with their corresponding names. The decks of city cards and obstruction cards are each shuffled. All players draw one card from the city deck and take the corresponding marker from the board, thus having collected 1 of the 6 different colors, needing to collect only 5 more.<br/><br/>",

Each player in Dicehack is competing against the others. Games take 45-60 minutes, depending on the number of players. The player boards provide nearly all the reference information you'll need to play. Game play is a combination of wagering resources, luck of the roll, and strategy in capturing, attacking, and defending. Players roll dice and try to add or multiply them to unlock a series of spaces in the Fibonacci Sequence. Math is not for everyone, but you can win at Dicehack using the calculator on your smartphone. You'll wager the number of dice you'll need to open spaces on your board, to attack other players and set them back, to protect your own spaces from attack, and to allow you to change faces on other dice. You'll choose your targets, use your number skills, and manage your resources. The first player that unlocks all eight spaces on their board wins the game.<br/><br/>",

When landing on a special square, they have the ability to kill an enemy spy, send him back to his embassy or transport themselves to another square on the board (using a secret tunnel, an embassy car etc.).<br/><br/>A special element of the game is that among the six spies of each player, there are two double agents. During the game, players sometimes get the chance to study their opponent's spies to identify their true allegiance.

Players can use shortcuts while Balthasar can't. When players step on an ant space they can draw a helping token (move twice, hide behind a bush, stop Balthasar for a round, choose any color etc.). On some special spaces there are one-time-only helps like a bird's or a hedgehog's help in transporting the given figure. Some birthday postcards are also left on the track - these have to be collected before Balthasar steps on this space, otherwise Balthasar finds them and there will be no surprise (the players lose).<br/><br/>",

You're supposed to answer as if you were the personality and the questioner is supposed to guess who you are. If they guess correctly, they advance along a track, if they fail, the next player tries another question and so on. If no-one guesses correctly, you reverse down the track for giving bad clues.

The value of a single property increases, when you have more than one of the same group, but this is not so easy, because the single group members are well spread over the whole board.<br/><br/>The game ends after a fixed amount of time, which must be defined before the start.<br/><br/>Similar to &quot;Your Hometown Tycoon Game&quot;, several editions exist, each of them depicting shops and stores from a specific city or region in Germany or Switzerland.<br/><br/>",

The differences in the cards can lead to some interesting game play - some cards allow you to pass cards to another player, reverse or bounce other penalty cards, or even trade hands with other players. The large number of players allowed also makes it good when you want something on the fly for a large group, as it's easy to learn and relatively quick to play.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Each player is the Head of a Counter-espionage Agency and has the mission of catching as many enemy agents as he can.  Unfortunately there are a lot of false trails which make the job more difficult than it could be.  Besides this one must constantly work out what it is the other players are trying to do.  Who is it then who will turn out to be the most successful Counter-espionage Chief......?<br/><br/>SCHNAPP DEN SPION, or Counter Espionage is a memory and tactics game for 2 to 6 players from Age 6.<br/><br/>The game has 60 agents cards which are laid face down on the board.  These represent either the agents that players are trying to capture, or false trails.  There are 10 cards in each colour of which 3 are agents and 7 are false trails.<br/><br/>Each player attempts to capture enemy agents (any agent that is not the same colour as the player's counter).  When less than 6 people play all agents, including those not directly involved in the game, are considered to be enemy agents.  A player can theoretically capture 15 agents - there are 18 agents in the game, 3 of which are friendly.<br/><br/>Players take it in turns to look secretly at two cards, returning them face down to the space they came from  In so doing the players try an identify and memorise where the agents are on the board.  When a player has discovered the location of a sufficient number of enemy agents he can, when it is his turn, place one of his three capture cards in the middle of the board.  He does this instead of looking at two cards.  In playing the capture card the player is allowed to take any number of agent cards from the board.  He lays these cards face down in front of him without having a look at the front of the cards.<br/><br/>A player that has used a capture card may, before his turn ends, move up to three cards, one at a time, from where they are to any unoccupied space.  This is done without looking at any of them.<br/><br/>Play continues until players have used up their capture cards or believe there are no more secret agents to capture.  At the end of the game all the players turn over their agent cards and scores points as follows:<br/><br/>Captured enemy agents + 3 points<br/>Captured own agents -  3 points<br/>False trails (own or enemy) -  2 points<br/><br/>The winner is the player with the highest score.  <br/><br/><br/>",

Gameplay is similar, but the the push-your-luck aspect is missing, and there's only six dials (rather than 9), and twelve treasure cards (rather than 29).<br/><br/>Players turn the dials, trying to match the pattern for the round. When they succeed, they take one treasure card, which at the same time will show the pattern for the next round. Once all treasure cards have been taken, the game ends, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/><br/>Unlock the treasure chest.<br/><br/>The missing treasure chest form Ali Baba has been found! You have to turn the locks into the right position. But only the one who turns the last lock in the right way, may open the chest.<br/><br/>On a turn a player may turn one lock 1 or 2 images to the left or to the right. When the desired image becomes visible, the lock stays open and the player may attempt to open another lock. If another image shows than the desired image, the next player is on turn.<br/><br/>You always have to try to get at least one lock right. You are allowed to stop at any time after that. Locks who show the desired image are not allowed to be turned anymore.<br/><br/>The aim of the game is to turn the locks so each lock shows the same picture. The person who manages to turn the last (6th) lock may open the treasure chest and get a treasure out. That treasure is the next image that has to be shown on all locks. The player left from the one who found the treasure starts the next treasure search.<br/><br/>When all treasures have been gotten out, all points on the treasure cards are counted. The player with the most points wins. In case of a tie, the player with the most treasures wins.<br/><br/>",

There will be  four corner discard piles: Victory Points, Game Length, Battlefleet, and Events.<br/><br/>Face cards (J, Q, and K) in the game represent invaders, blocking Expansion (literally blocking the draw pile that they sit upon).<br/><br/>Numerical cards 2 through 10 can be assigned to one of three discard piles: Victory Points, Game Length, or Battlefleet.<br/><br/>The Victory Point discard will be your final score, which will be reduced by 25% per remaining active invader in play at the end of the game, unless the Truce Event is revealed.<br/><br/>The Game Length discard can never be less than the Victory Point discard (but can be the same). This discard exists to force the player to play cards here he may want for other discards.<br/><br/>The Battlefleet discard is a temporary holding area for cards to add up to either 11 (for the Jack), 12 (for the Queen), or 13 (for the King) to knock invaders off their draw piles.<br/><br/>Aces represent Events. There are only 4 events in the game, cumulating in the final event, a Truce, which ends the game.<br/><br/>Each turn you Explore (flip top card of each unblocked draw pile), then Expand (assign those non-face cards to discard piles), then Exploit (use Events if Aces are drawn), and Exterminate (assign cards from the Battlefleet pile to a blocking Invader card to discard it out of play).<br/><br/>The best score you can hope for is 10 points.<br/><br/>",

The tale is different every time you play &hellip; or you can download new Sojourner Tales to play from the website at sojournertales.com!<br/><br/>Beginning with the player holding the Lead Player token (Lead Player), players perform each turn in two rounds of play: a Journey round (movement) and a Story round.<br/><br/>Movement is by die roll down paths connecting &lsquo;locations&rsquo; and &lsquo;Chapter Disks&rsquo; situated on event spaces around the board. Players moves either allow them end movement on locations or &lsquo;Chapter Disks&rsquo;. If there is another player&rsquo;s token on the end movement space, both players &lsquo;dual&rsquo; for control of that space, the winner determining which of them will move 1-2 spaces forward off of that space. &lsquo;Chapter Disks&rsquo; may be picked up off the board in the next round in which case that space is no longer counted for movement, thus offering diminishing options for movement as the game progresses.<br/><br/>Once all player tokens conclude movement, the Story round begins with the Lead Player. Players on &lsquo;Chapter Disks&rsquo; of another player&rsquo;s color end their round. Players who are on face-up &lsquo;Chapter Disks&rsquo; of their own color take them off the board and put them on a display card in front of them. If they have as many &lsquo;Chapter Disks&rsquo; as the current &lsquo;chapter&rsquo; marker on the board, then they have an Epic Story&rsquo; event (referencing the &lsquo;chapter&rsquo; and &lsquo;scene&rsquo; markers on the board for the entry number) and become the Lead Player. Otherwise, they have a &lsquo;Twisted Tales&rsquo; event, combining two cards from the &lsquo;twisted&rsquo; deck and a third card from the &lsquo;Tales&rsquo; deck into a short plot description.<br/><br/>Both Epic Story Events and Twisted Tales events generate a Tales reference number which another player at the table looks up in the Sojourner Story Book. This Story Book is either a paper book included in the game OR it is an ebook file (epub or mobi format) which has been downloaded from our website. This Story Book is the story engine of the game. Each entry may offer a particular challenge to the player, forward the &lsquo;Chapter&rsquo; and &lsquo;Scene&rsquo; markers on the board or grant &lsquo;Destiny Cards&rsquo; which players may use to better their position or hinder other players during the game.<br/><br/>Optional rules permit creative players to generate their own &lsquo;generic story&rsquo; extemporaneously during play.<br/><br/>Generally, the objective is to obtain five &lsquo;Story Disks&rsquo; of your own color to win the game. You battle other players and the Tales Book entries as well to achieve this. The conclusion finishes the story and declares the winning storyteller.<br/><br/>",

Creatures infused with the very Magics of the land lay siege to the many races and kingdoms of the land. The Dwarves ran to their caves, seeking refuge from the attacks, they sealed themselves away. <br/>The Elves used the remaining magic they had to conjurer a protective dome around their capital, that would keep them isolated for the next 500 years. The Paurian cat people of the jungles seemingly disappeared.The Honorable Canin people went north, far north of the Great Mountains. Humanity was all that was left to fend off the creatures hell bent on  destruction. Though the Magi Elders had worked to seal each creature,almost 5 centuries later, the seals have begun to break. <br/>The creatures have begun resurfacing and only the greatest Champions of the proud Banners can expel them again, hopefully this time, for good....<br/><br/>In Tabula Rasa, 2-4 Players race through one of the crumbling seals, to wade through the waves of enemies and defeat the great threat that lies there! Players will find gear for their Champion, learn new abilities and gather loot, all while completing the quests the banners had laid out for them. Though in the end, only one though will be honored in the Hall of Glory.<br/><br/>On each turn, players spend their crystals to performs actions and abilities, bringing them deeper into the threats lair, or allowing them to confront and defeat different threats and enemies that appear during the game.<br/><br/>Players will be able to build a better pool of Crystals to go back into their bag, as each time they must draw but cannot, their discard pile of used crystals goes back into the back, gets shaken up and drawn from again. Having a better or stronger pool gives you the ability to maximize your turns!<br/><br/>Some crystals fuel abilities, some are bad and need to be culled, and some are blank slates that slow you down. Building a good pool will help you complete quests and defeat minions, advancing the boss's threat track.<br/><br/>The Boss of the dungeon or lair isn't just going to sit back either. Every round their influence on the seal is felt, their minions attempt to stop you, and of course and as the game progresses on the threat track, when it reaches it's threshold, players ALL confront the ancient threat for glory.<br/><br/>When the seal has been cleaned out, players count up their Glory and the winner's legend rings out through the land as they enter the Hall of Glory!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "From Game Booklet:<br/><br/>&quot;This fun, interactive board game teaches children ages 9 to 13 how having financial goals helps families make smart money choices and live quality lives.  Pick a character; choose a path.  What sharing, saving and spending choices will you make to reach your character's goal? Roll the die and see where the money choices you make lead you.&quot;<br/><br/>Ostensibly, this game seeks to teach children the pros and cons of different spending profiles.  Players choose a character mat featuring one of the characters, including Craig Cautious, Mike Mega Purchase, Wella D'Versified, Livva Below Means, Minnie Miserly, Charlie Givva, Sandy Status Quo, and Sammy Spend-a-Lot.  Each character has a salary, a cash goal, and varying goals in four categories: Necessities, Save, Share, and Spend.<br/><br/>Players choose a path on the board among Share, Save, or Spend, and move a pawn down that path collecting a card from the appropriate stack on every move.  Each card has actions for the player to carry out, such as &quot;You received interest on your savings -- Receive $50 for each {Savings Token} you have.&quot;  Players can change paths when they reach a corner or when they reach a transition bridge space.  In addition to the decks for Save, Share, and Spend, there is a Wild deck that players draw from when they land on a Wild space; Wild actions are a bit random and are to simulate the ups and downs of life.<br/><br/>At the end of the game there is a guided section for parents to discuss the game aspects with their children, on topics such as: the importance of sharing, the value of saving, the value of investing, and further opportunities to engage children in learning about successful money management.<br/><br/>Distributed by Thrivent Financial for Lutherans<br/><br/>",

Depending on the results, a player will recieves the corresponding &quot;title&quot; and mooncake.<br/><br/>The lucky player who gains the title of &quot;Zhuangyuan,&quot; will be the ultimate winner in the game and recieve the largest mooncake<br/><br/>The 300-year-old game of bo bing dates back to the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911). The inventor, Zheng Chenggong (1624-62), a general of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644), stationed his army in Xiamen. Zheng was determined to recover Taiwan, which was occupied by Dutch invaders since 1624.<br/><br/>When the Mid-Autumn Festival came, the soldiers naturally missed their families but fought with heroic determination to drive off the aggressors.<br/><br/>General Zheng and his lower officer Hong Xu invented bo bing to help relieve homesickness among the troops.<br/><br/>",

Exchange turns with your opponent, building up your own sustainability with Blue cards, unleashing an onslaught on your opponent with Red cards, or gather your forces for your next move with Yellow cards. Can't decide? Then combine these strategies using Secondary cards. The last player, who can still play wins. With only six types of cards, Primary is easy to learn but offers a unique depth of strategy allowing each player to adapt their own strategic approach.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "See, there are these things called giggities. They sort of flutter around touching peeps and absorbing their traits. If one touched you, for example, it might nab itself your mighty hairstyle, or maybe your Grandma&rsquo;s taco recipe, or your ability to blast fireballs out of your nose. That sort of stuff&hellip;<br/><br/>Giggity giggers are zazz wagglers (magical sorts) who have hipped themselves to the gist of how to capture giggities, yoink the traits the giggities nabbed from others, and g&rsquo;zoink them onto themselves. So, like, if you&rsquo;re a giggity gigger and you capture a giggity who once touched me and absorbed my buns of steel, you can waggle your zazz and get yourself some sweet, sweet buns of your own.<br/><br/>That&rsquo;s G&rsquo;Zoink in a nutshell. Simple, yet hideously complex. Players are giggity giggers who catch giggities and g&rsquo;zoink their traits in an attempt to become the most awesome zazz waggler since zazz waggling first became a thing that&rsquo;s a thing. It&rsquo;s not that easy, though, because giggities don&rsquo;t only absorb the good stuff. If you don&rsquo;t play your cards right you might end up with horrible backne or a blue hairy tongue or something even worse.<br/><br/>G&rsquo;Zoink takes place on Mutha Oith, the setting for the Low Life RPG and the Dementalism card game, but familiarity with such things is not necessary for players to enjoy the game.<br/><br/>Each round, players select a card from one of the locales.  The highest card wins the round and takes all the cards.  You may also acquire The Fix cards which will give you additional positive or negative points at the end of the game.  The game ends when all cards have been taken.  Players total the points on all their Giggities and add in any bonus or penalty points from The Fix cards.  The highest score wins.<br/><br/>",

Ticonderoga) during the French and Indian War (1755-58). The game system emphasizes the importance of leaders, and highlights the role of individual command skills, circumstances and luck. Throughout the game, leaders&rsquo; skills are tested as their units maneuver and fight, and every leader has the capacity to be &ldquo;inept,&rdquo; &ldquo;capable&rdquo; or &ldquo;exceptional,&rdquo; varying from engagement to engagement.<br/><br/>The game includes a lot of randomization; so every game may vary in tempo. One game may involve more soldiers than another, and often the quality of the lower-level (unnamed) leaders will be different. There are three campaign and three raid scenarios, featuring many units for the longer games and fewer for shorter ones (280 counters total). Each hex on the Strategic Map represents 1.5 miles, whereas each hex on the Tactical Map (for the area near Ticonderoga) represents just 400 yards. Individual units represent from 50 to 800 men, and leader chits each represent a single commander, sometimes a famous historical figure, at other times an unknown man of low-rank.<br/><br/>Designed by William Nester and Eric R. Harvey<br/>Map design: Joe Youst<br/>Counters: Trevor Holman<br/><br/>",

(This is where the strategy comes in) Do you pick a lower point card or a higher point card? The Youngest player then rolls the three dice, trying to match one of the die or combination of dice to their card amount which is face up. Each time the die/dice combination match the player's card that is face up, the player gets to move the card into their &quot;mile pile&quot; trying to be the first to hike 100 miles. Players must beware of getting caught with a &quot;cooler card&quot; - like the mother bear &amp; cubs in the trail. If you get caught with one of the three cooler cards you loose 10 miles. Other twists in the game include bonus rolls if the player&rsquo;s dice totals the card amount that is face up. Don&rsquo;t forget to look out for the trips /doubles rule which is when any of the dice come up with doubles or triples. You take a card from the person to your right.<br/><br/>",

Based on the &quot;Best Seller&quot; this game, like the movie, has two exciting parts. The first is prior to the Rapture and the second is after the Rapture. It is the classic contest between good and evil. In the first part of the game, the players' task is to answer questions correctly or even deceive other players with false confessions and earn Left Behind Tokens. These tokens are of great value in the second part of the game (which starts without warning). This is when Carpathia enters the game and causes individual players to band together forming the Tribulation Force. From this moment on, the goal is to work together to defeat Carpathia or face elimination. This unique game can give players a heightened awareness of the &quot;end times&quot;.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Ninja Pizza Party, each player has their own stack of pizza slice cards. Each round, customers equal to one less than the number of players (except in two-player) are randomly chosen and the players all go through their stack of pizza slices one at a time, either adding the slice to their pizza or discarding it. Once they run out of cards in their stack, they take the discard pile from the player to their right to use as their new stack of slices. When a player completes their pizza of six slices, they claim the customer of their choice. This continues until all of the customers have been claimed. Points are awarded based on how many slices each player's pizza has that match the customer's favorite topping.<br/><br/>When building a pizza, the players must match at least one topping on the slice next to the spot where the new slice is going to go. For the sixth (and last) slice, the slice being added needs to match a topping on each of the pieces next to the open slot. Each slice of pizza has two toppings, except for special &quot;kitchen sink&quot; slices, that have all of the available toppings. These special slices are limited to one per pizza. If a player's pizza is completed but does not follow the rules, the player that did not claim a customer can score points for that other player's customer, using their incomplete pizza, provided said pizza DOES follow the placement rules.<br/><br/>At the end of the round, each player takes their current stack, discard pile, and pizza and combines them to form their new stack for the next round. Customers are randomized and selected again, and the next round begins.<br/><br/>This continues until at least one player has 15 points, at which time the player with the most points is declared the winner.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

The object of the game is to be the first player to have his/her character reach the Citadel at the top of the mountain, which is the center hex of the game board. Players guide their character-counter from the board's edge, which is the base of the mountain, along paths and through tunnels in order to get to the peak. Attempting to stop the players is a malevolent Wizard, played by one of the players. The Wizard controls the different monsters on the mountain, causing them to seek out the characters and do battle with them. The object for the Wizard player is to see that no one reaches the Citadel. Depending on the number of players, the game should last between 45 minutes (two players)and 3 hours (10 players).<br/><br/>(additional comments) One of the nice things is that each character can customize the stats and equipment of their characters.<br/><br/>",

The aim of the game is to cross the finish line first with your cattle, thus earning the most points possible: but will this be enough in order to win the game? Before the race starts, players lay secret bets on the final standings of the race: well-placed bets on other players' cows may give you the extra points you need to win... or will you dare betting everything on your own cattle, going for broke? At his turn, the player rolls the die: if he rolls a number between one and four, he moves the relevant cow forward one square. On a five, the player may move a cow of his choice, and on a six, the player may choose either to move a cow of his choice, or to &quot;milk&quot; one. A milked cow usually loses ground and possibly positions in the race... Some special squares on the course give this fast paced and unusual race an extra twist; the race ends when one of the cows crosses the finish line. Each player earns points according to his cow's final standing, plus extra points if he won any bet: whoever has the most points at the end will be nominated Dairy Farmer of the Year!<br/><br/>This game was available in the free web magazine GiocAreA OnLine (former partner of daVinci Editrice) as a promotional tool.<br/><br/>",

However, if two players tie for highest card, the totem goes to whoever played the lowest card. If all players tie, the totem returns to the center of the table. Each player plays with their own set of cards, made up of one entire suit from a deck of cards. Each time a team (or the totem) wins, that team (or the totem) gets a point. The first team to get three points wins. However, if the totem gets three points, or if all cards are played without a winner, the totem wins and everyone elso loses.

Any number other than 7, 2 or 12 requires placing the stake (or stone from the set) on the number rolled on the supplied board.<br/><br/>Roll 2 and take the stakes from 8-12, but place a stake on 2.  Roll a 12 and take the stakes from 2-6, but place a stake on 2.  Roll a 7 and you take ALL the stakes, or place one stake on 7 if the board is empty.<br/><br/>Play continues until agreed, or all but one of the players is out of money (or stones).

        "description": "Exterior - night. A lone slayer stands in the market place, gazing. Suddenly, a flash of light appears in the sky, and a flaming meteor plummets to the Earth. &quot;All right&quot;, he thinks. &quot;Now we're cooking!&quot;<br/><br/>Welcome to Zombie Slayer!<br/>An evil necromancer has overrun a (formerly) peaceful village with his army of zombies.The zombies are roaming the streets in search for human flesh. Though there are some townspeople left, the main attraction is you - the slayer that has been called to take care of the problem.<br/>Can you save the townies and defeat the evil necromancer?<br/><br/>Zombie Slayer is a free print &amp; play solitaire fantasy game, putting you into the role of a Warrior that has been called to rid the evil off the land.  For starters, you might want to play with the pre-generated slayer, but there are rules provided to create your own slayer.<br/><br/>You explore the town by drawing the different parts of the town from a deck. Whenever you move through the town, Zombies will spawn around you, trying to finish you off.  If you're lucky, you may run into villagers as well or maybe in one of the buildings you find your treasure helping you on the way?<br/><br/>Aside from the card drawing exploration mechanic, everything else (combat, searching) is dice driven - and you will roll dice a lot!<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Advances in the future have led to the creation of biomechanoid ships, capable of penetrating the barriers between the Mutliverse Orders. There, with the ability to command the vast energies available, biokind waged war  with itself for control of the Multiverse.<br/><br/>Diatomica is a 2 player &quot;batteline&quot; style game lasting about 30 minutes. Players place cards on their side of the Multiverse Orders to gain attack strength. When the Threshold Value is reached the control for that Order is decided. The player who controls the most Orders at game end is the winner.<br/><br/>Basic Game - Each player receives one set of the 6 different Ship cards (Organelle, Vault Complex, Cluster Hive, Plastid, Centriole, Shift). The remaining 6 Ship cards are then shuffled and 3 are dealt to each player. Each player now has 9 cards in their Ship deck. Each player should shuffle their Ship deck and set it to one side.<br/><br/>Advanced Game - Shuffle the 18 Ship cards, creating a Drafting deck. Each player draws 3 cards to their hand. 1 card is chosen to be added to the player&rsquo;s Ship deck, and is placed in front of them, face down. 1 card is then passed to the opposing player.<br/><br/>Of the remaining 2 cards in hand, 1 card is again added to each player&rsquo;s Ship deck. The final card in each player&rsquo;s hand is placed on the bottom of the Drafting deck. Repeat drawing hands of 3 cards and drafting choices until all 18 cards have been drawn. During the final draw each player will receive one card to be added to their Ship deck of 9 cards. Each player should shuffle their Ship deck and set it to one side.<br/><br/>Shuffle the remaining 30 cards and create a Draw deck. Each player, beginning with the Start Player (who is chosen at random), draws 3 cards from the Draw deck to their hand as well as 3 cards from their Ship deck.<br/><br/>Lastly place the 40 markers within reach of both players. These wil be used during the game to show the amount of energy a player has to draw from as well as Attack Strength modifiers.<br/><br/>Play: <br/>Beginning with the Start Player, each player&rsquo;s turn consists of <br/>3 phases. Player&rsquo;s are free to consider any phase optional but phases go in order:<br/><br/>1. Playing a card: The player may play a card from their hand beneath any of the 6 Multiverse Orders not yet controlled, stacking the cards vertically in a column.<br/><br/>2. Activating a Special Ability: The player may now activate the Special Ability of any one card they have previously played to any Multiverse Order.<br/><br/>3. Drawing/Discarding a card: The player now draws back to a hand limit of 6 cards from either their Ship deck and/or from the Draw deck.<br/><br/>Control Phase:<br/>Once the die&rsquo;s value on a Multiverse Order card falls below zero, the die is removed and normal phases of a player&rsquo;s turn are halted.<br/><br/>The player who played a card to reach or pass the Threshold Value is now the Attacking Player. They add up all Attack Strengths of their cards in that Multiverse Order&rsquo;s column, including any Attack markers and any additional Ship bonuses. The Attacking Player then announces their total Attack Strength.<br/><br/>The opposing player, now the Defending Player, may:<br/><br/>A. Play a Ship card from their hand spending Energy markers equal to the Threshold value of the Ship card to only the Multiverse Order currently under the Control Phase<br/><br/>or<br/><br/>B. Activate the Special Ability of one card played to their side of any of the Multiverse Order cards, spending Energy markers as required.<br/><br/>Game End:<br/>When control over the final Multiverse Order is decided, the player who has the most Control Value points is the winner. (Note: Game end should also be triggered if one player has won more than half the total Control Value points.) If players are tied, the player who has the greatest number of Energy markers is the winner. If still tied, the player who has control over the Multiverse Order of Icosa is the winner.<br/><br/>",

The four engines start at the sheds and must get to the station around the various lines and branch lines. There are three principle junctions and here may stand (in imposing black) the ample figure of The Fat Controller (the worthy Sir Topham Hatt). Engines may not go down the line blocked by The Fat Controller. However, a player whose engine lands on a yellow space (of which there are a number) must move The Fat Controller to another junction. Coming at a strategic moment this can send one's opponents off around a loop-line. There are also a number of spaces with special effects; 'Throw Again' and (very popular this one) 'Send any engine back to shed' are examples. Movement is regulated by a dice roll. Engines may pass each other but may not occupy the same space.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly a popular feature of Thomas the Tank Engine is the four little engine models executed in excellent detail in the predominant colour. The wheel arrangements are correct although it must be remarked that James The Red Engine (who is, you will remember, a Mixed Goods engine) lacks his tender. The four engines provided are Thomas, Percy, James and Toby, and the only complaint among my nephews was that there was no Gordon, Henry or Edward (I'm a Troublesome Truck man myself). Naturally I had to point out that the game board dipslayed Thomas' branch line, not the main line where extremely important engines would operate. I felt there was a ground swell here for an expansion kit.<br/><br/>Among its intended market the game is a great success but it is too simple other than for tinkering with by older gamers. Although, having said that, I have noticed it is a popular game for visitors to take down and play about with.<br/><br/>",

Two powerful minds trying to figure out the intentions of their adversary every step of the way. They only have 12 hours to solve or commit the crime of the century.<br/><br/>The crime plan plotted by Moriarty is divided into 3 threads: Tool, Type and Victim of the crime. Using the Influence cards and the unique abilities of their Agents, players try to reveal or keep secret the individual threads of the crime.<br/><br/>Each round of the game is a different, characteristic location on the map of London. Each of these places changes the rules or introduces some restrictions. Thanks to this, each game is different and the multitude of strategies and ways to gain an advantage gives you a lot of room for maneuver and makes each game unique.<br/><br/>When the clock on the clocktower strikes twelfth and one of the threads is still uncovered, Holmes is defeated and Moriarty triumphs by comitting the crime of the century. However, it does not have to happen ...<br/><br/>Beautiful artwork by Barbara Wiszyńska-Kubit and great replayability will ensure hours of unforgettable fun for everyone.<br/><br/>&mdash;description from the publisher<br/><br/>",

Beyond that, each team version of the game was identical.<br/><br/>The game uses a board very similar to a Monopoly board.  Each team has a square and there are several special squares (Interception, Touchdown, Super Bowl, Kickoff, and Penalty) that each have specific rules as to how they affect the game.<br/><br/>Each turn in the game represents a football &quot;play&quot;  After the player rolls the dice and moves their helmet, they draw a play card (team space and super bowl space) or penalty card (penalty space) or they score (touchdown space).  There are also special rules for 4th downs, field goals, punts (and returns), kickoffs (and returns), fumbles, and safeties.<br/><br/>The game goes for 4 quarters, each consisting of 25 &quot;play&quot; cards.  After all of the &quot;play&quot; cards are exhausted, the game is over, and the player with the most points wins.<br/><br/>",

But six is a recommended maximum, to expedite play.<br/><br/>Just like bowling in a league, the contestants compete for best average between three complete, 10 frame lines of dice bowling.<br/><br/>The Dice:<br/><br/>The Red &amp; White dice are to be rolled together first in each frame. If a STRIKE is rolled, regardless of what is on the other die, this is entered on the scoresheet, and the next player proceeds with their turn.<br/><br/>A STRIKE is rolled when one of the two dice shows the word, or when the two dice show ten total pins (5 each).<br/><br/>The Green &amp; White die is rolled when any combination of pins showing on the dice, other than a STRIKE or SPLIT are shown. This die is rolled after the initial roll of the Red &amp; White dice in an attempt to pick up the spare. Also, if SPLIT is showing with 3, 4, or 5 pins on the other die (Red &amp; White Dice) then the player enters the number of pins on the other die as an initial score and rolls the Green &amp; White die to pick up the spare.<br/><br/>The Blue &amp; White die is rolled when SPLIT appears on the initial Red &amp; White dice roll with 1 or 2 pins showing on the other die. The scorekeeper will enter this as 7 or 8 pins for the first roll. (The SPLIT is counted as six pins plus the 1 or 2 other pins). When either of these combinations occur the player must use the Blue &amp; White die in an effort to pick up the spare.<br/><br/>One Red &amp; White dice is marked SPLIT, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

The key to victory is to find which enemy ship holds the enemy commander.<br/><br/>Each player's fleet consists of a Mother Ship (with turrets), four Cruisers and six Fighters. There's also your Prison Outpost, which is sort of your home base (it doesn't move or shoot). Underneath a secretly chosen ship, you place the peg representing your commander. If he's captured, you lose.<br/>On your turn, you get four dice rolls, which can be used to move (orthogonally) or shoot to capture. You must announce each attempt *before* rolling the dice. Each piece can normally move and/or shoot only once (except Cruisers, who can shoot again if they miss).<br/><br/>The board is divided into two colors of zones, and this affects shooting and movement. Captured pieces can be freed if you reach the holding Prison Outpost. Having one's Mother Ship captured is real bad because it does not go to the Prison Outpost --it is removed altogether!<br/><br/>Every time you capture (including ships in one of a Mother Ship's launching bays), you get a bonus roll; basically, the shot that just occurred doesn't count against your four rolls. The bonus roll must be taken by the same piece.<br/><br/>",

The game is for 2-6 players and takes 20 minutes to 2 hours to play.  The more players, the longer the game.<br/><br/>There are many possible paths across the board.  There are hazards and obstacles along every path.<br/><br/>Movement is determined by die roll.  The person who is in possession of the &quot;Gem Die&quot; is allowed to roll two dice instead of the normal single die to determine movement.  All the other players must try to catch the one carrying the &quot;Gem Die&quot;.  If the one carrying the &quot;Gem Die&quot; is caught, the &quot;Gem Die&quot; magically goes back to the &quot;Gem Vault&quot;.  The action then shifts back to trying to acquire the &quot;Gem Die&quot;.<br/><br/>The game ends when one person successfully brings the &quot;Gem Die&quot; back to the starting point or when someone scores a certain number of points by carrying the &quot;Gem Die&quot; for certain distances across the board.<br/><br/>The game is in an 18 inch long by 2 inch wide mailing tube.<br/><br/>Contents:  Game container (mailer tube); game board (24&quot; x 18&quot; when unrolled); 2 opaque dice; 1 clear &quot;Gem Die&quot;; 6 playing pieces (clear and colored acrylic cubes); 20 glass point counters (smooth glass pebbles); 3 boat pieces (metal finishing washers, #8 size).<br/><br/>",

Each turn, a player draws a card from the deck to determine which region they must defend. To repel an attack, heroes roll a die and use their special abilities by gaining XP. If they do not defend efficiently, the threat to see the kingdom falling under the claws of Argo will grow&hellip;<br/><br/>Argo wins the game if the deck runs out of cards, if the threat is too high, or if he defeats the heroes four or five times.<br/><br/>Heroes win the game if they gain enough prestige to force Argo to abandon the war, but prestige is not easily gained: Only a victory in combat against Argo or his strongest armies will reward the heroes with prestige!<br/><br/>",

Whilst no previous knowledge of this ancient script is required, play is designed to help you recognize a range of the more commonly found hieroglyphs - making future viewing of Egyptian exhibits even more exciting!<br/><br/>The game involves moving a scarab beetle around the board in an effort to collect the signs necessary to spell a given hieroglyphic word. Whilst attempting to do this, you are at the same time trying to thwart your opponents' efforts to complete their words.<br/><br/>The colorful game board displays the 24 signs of the basic hieroglyphic alphabet, plus a small selection of the seven hundred other signs used by Ancient Egyptian scribes.<br/><br/>Contents: <br/>One Scarab Beetle Playing Piece <br/>One Die <br/>One Full color Board <br/>Eight Hieroglyphic Word Sheets <br/>One Rule Scroll <br/>Twenty Black Counters<br/><br/>",

With 2 or 3 players, only use 2 or three colors.<br/><br/>Object: To only have your own color under your cups.<br/><br/>Game Course:<br/>The starting player chooses a player, and points to one of his cups. He then says something like, &quot;The smallest cup in that stack is my color&quot;. (He may also choose  the middle sized cup in the stack.<br/><br/>The player spoken to uncovers the named cup.<br/><br/>If the guess is correct, the player receives the cup of his color, and gives the other player a cup of the same size from beneath one of his cups. Both sets of cups are uncovered visibly so that all players may see what is beneath them.<br/><br/>The players may then shuffle their cups to try to obscure which cup was just revealed.<br/><br/>A player who made a correct guess goes again. He may choose a stack from the same player, or of a different player. A player can keep going as long as he is right. Once the player misses his guess, then the player whose cup he was guessing takes the next turn.<br/><br/>Mixing cups:<br/>Whenever a player has to reveal his cups, he is allowed to mix them. Players who have not shown their cups are NOT allowed to mix theirs.<br/><br/>Each player may peek under his own stacks secretly at any time.<br/>End of Game:<br/>The game ends when any one player has only his own color cups under his stacks.<br/> <br/><br/><br/>",

        "description": "Danger Dive is one of the Milton Bradley &quot;Flipsiders&quot; games that resembles an audio cassette until you &quot;flip&quot; the game open. The object of the Diver player is to move the diver along the track to the ocean floor, get the gold and return to the surface without being caught by a sea creature. The Sea Creature player tries to catch the diver by moving either the octopus or the shark onto the diver's space. Two spinners are used for movement. The diver uses either number spun while the sea creatures each use one of the numbers. The diver also has a Stun Gun with four charges which he can use to try and stun (cause to lose turn) one or both creatures. The first player to fulfill his victory conditions wins.<br/><br/>",

After consulting charts for line of sight, weapon statistics, infantry statistics, movement factors, target size, and environmental factors, players roll percentile dice each attack round to determine hits.

It actually leaves you time to enjoy watching football.<br/><br/>Three easy steps: 1)Hold a simple draft - instead of drafting individual players, you will draft team positions. 2)Draft only 6 positions - QB, RB, WR, K, Team Score, &amp; Team Defense. 3)Game on!<br/><br/>Contains 100 team score sheets, 50 draft selection sheets, 16 draft pick cards, past performances charts and player rosters for the 1992, 1993, and 1994 seasons, 2 book marks, 1 game board, 1 game play book, 1 set of league forms, and 1 pencil.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "&quot;No time to waste&quot; is a cooperative trivia-game. The central piece of the game is a clock with an arrow that starts at 12 o'clock, and than starts moving clock-wise, taking exactly an hour for one turn. Surrounding the clock are tiles that are face down at the start of the game, but that are turned up during the game (showing colorful pictures of nature) if the players succeed in answering trivia questions about environmental topics. The clock-arrow indicates how well the players are doing because if the tile-turning is ahead of the arrow the players are doing well, but if they are behind they are in trouble!<br/>Other trouble for the players comes from wrong answers, because after a wrong answer a red card has to be turned over, which may mean that the Greenpeace ship is blocked. In case of a blockade progress on the dial is stopped (but the clock moves on!). Luckily good answers not only turn over tiles, but also give players green card that they can use to remove blockades.<br/>The game is cooperative because everyone wins if the last tile is turned over, and everyone loses when the clock runs out.<br/><br/>",

Players start with their cache of seeds in opposite corners of the board. The contents of a pit are distributed into the succeeding pits in a particular manner not unlike the &quot;sowing&quot; that happens in Mancala games. The object of the game is to form a row of four occupied holes (the colors of the seeds don't matter), diagonally or orthogonally. In addition, you win if your opponent can't move.<br/><br/>",

The remaining two dice are passed to the next player who adds one more (maintaining 2 different colors if possible), rolls and selects one, and so on until the dice pool are used.<br/><br/>Some dice have horseshoes which, when selected, are used to move a horse (the roller chooses) up in the order.

The cards contain a picture &ndash; a snapshot, if you will &ndash; from 1969. Each scene starts with a picture. The players play one card each and the host picks which one starts the scene. The player who laid down that card makes up a short story about what is going on. The other players may challenge this to change it or add to it. Once everyone has had a chance to add to the scene, the scene ends. The host awards the card to the player he found the most entertaining. The player with the most scenes wins the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "The game is played on a board consisting of 8x8 squares. Both players have a set of eight arrows, which start on the first row on their side of the board.<br/><br/>The arrows have four different colours: white, blue, yellow and red. White is stronger than blue, blue is stronger than yellow, yellow is stronger than red and red is stronger than white.<br/><br/>On his turn, a player may move any one of his arrows a single square in any direction. If an arrow ends up next to a weaker opposing arrow, the weaker arrow is placed two squares back. If it cannot be moved back, it is removed from the game.<br/><br/>Goal of the game is to have your arrows reach the center four squares of the back row. Each of these squares is colour coded. If an arrow matches the the colour of the pin, two points are scored, otherwise, a single point is scored. The player who gains the most points wins the game.<br/><br/>",

Instead of houses and hotels, players buy environmental programs like a hunting ban or pollution control.  Chance and Community Chest cards are replaced by a single &quot;action card&quot; deck.  The mechanics of the games are the same, however: roll and move, if you land on someone else's preserve, pay them money.  If they have one or more programs on that preserve, pay them even more.  One difference is how the game ends: it can end either like Monopoly (last player left after everyone else goes bankrupt wins) or a player can collect five of the species for a particular geographical area (color) in which case they win.<br/><br/>From the back of the box:<br/>ENDANGERED SPECIES is a game the entire family will enjoy.  It introduces players to the largest animal that ever lived, the fastest four-legged animal in the world, a huge bird of prey with a ten-foot wingspan, the most powerful ape, the fiercest carnivore in the Americas, and many other fascinating creatures now facing extinction.  Player try to &ldquo;save&rdquo; these animals by setting up &ldquo;Preserves&rdquo; to protect their natural habitats, and then establishing programs to protect them from hunting, capture for zoos, chemical pollution, and commercial exploitation.  To win, a player must save five species from one geographic area.  Unexpected gains and setbacks make the game unpredictable, and &ldquo;action cards&rdquo; held by each player permit a wide variety of strategic moves and counter moves.  No two games are ever the same.<br/><br/>",

If a player gets a &lsquo;P&rsquo; he puts a number of chips into the pot matching the number shown on the other die. If he gets a &lsquo;T&rsquo; he takes a number of chips equal to the number shown on the other die from the pot. Rolling an &lsquo;A&rsquo; on the numbered die means &lsquo;All&rsquo; (T+A means take all chips in the pot and P+A means you match the pot). Players are eliminated as they run out of chips. The last player still holding chips wins.<br/><br/>Early versions of Put and Take dice were made out of metal, wood, and bakelite.<br/><br/>",

The game is called Clock Solitaire, because twelve piles of cards are arranged like a clock face around a 13th one in he middle. The object of the game is to complete all other four-of-a-kind before the four kings are completed.<br/><br/>The cards are dealt face down into 13 piles, twelve in a circle around the last one in the middle. The piles are numbered 1 to 12 as on a clock face with pile 13 in the middle.<br/><br/>The top card of the 13 pile is revealed. Play the card under the corresponding pile. Ace under the 1 pile, 2 under 2, and so on. Faces are played Jacks under 11, Queens under 12, and King under 13. Then reveal the top card of this pile and play it as described above. If there is no more the face down card on this pile continue with the next face down card in clockwise order.<br/><br/>The game is won, if all piles become face up piles of four-of-a-kind. The game is lost, if the fourth king is revealed before all other cards are played face up.<br/><br/>",

The contestant picks a card containing a sentence that the panel has to try and guess. With the timer running, a panelist may ask 'yes' or 'no' questions to find the answer. If a yes answer is returned, the panelist continues while, if the answer is no, play passes to the next player. If one of the panelists mentions a word on the card, this word is written on the board. If the panelists determine what is on the card, they win. If not, play proceeds for three rounds of the timer.<br/><br/>At the end of each round if the answer is not guessed, the contestant wins a prize, like a picture of a guitar on a card or a picture of a boom box. After the third round, a game of charades ensues to try and determine the answer.<br/><br/>A 'Secret Slime&quot; is also present where if a panelist performs a certain action (like laugh or touch his/her face), he/she must complete a penalty task.<br/><br/>The game also includes an entry form to be on the show, but not a time travel machine to allow this.<br/><br/>",

The game contains 220 cards that represent British, German and Italian forces.<br/>Each vehicle card represents just one tank, half-track, or truck; each infantry card represents one squad of infantry; and each anti-tank gun card represents one AT-gun and its crew.

Players now choose 3 cards from their hands, which together will give a good points score for that Class of Car. They place their 3 cards face-down and all turn them over together. The set of 3 scoring most points for that Class wins, and the winner take<br/>all the cards from the table which show that Class, and any Bluebird cards. These are set aside and kept by the winner. The cards left on the table are returned to the players' hands.<br/>Play continues until the last CAR-CLASS card has been played for.<br/>Players count up all cards they have won (BLUEBIRD and TRIO cards) counting 1 point per card, and deducting 1 point for each card left in their hands.<br/>The winner is the first player to score an agreed number of points. For 4 players to reach 50 points will require about 6 or 7 games. For 2 players, 100 points will require about the same number of games.<br/><br/>Gameplay is the same as in the PLANES GAME and GIRL from the same publisher.<br/><br/>",

When opponents land on players owned property, the owning player collects rent from the landing player. Owning sets of properties increases the rent paid to the player who owns them, by the player who lands on the square. The ultimate goal is to have the most money and drive opponents into bankruptcy.<br/><br/>Another version of Monopoly, this time based on the city of Turku (Swedish name &Aring;bo), Finland.<br/><br/>",

Whomever makes the correct sound first wins the round. Additionally, the judge can pass out 2-3 words. Then the players must make all those sounds to win the round.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "A highly addictive reasoning game that is not bound by a board and can be played anywhere on a flat surface. Players take turns adding a picture tile to the existing grid of logical connections. When adding a tile, the player must state aloud the reason for the connection (ie. &quot;butterfly connects to airplane because both fly&quot; or &quot;sapling connects to chick because both are young members of their species&quot;). The other players decide if they consider the connection logical and thus acceptable. If the players disagree with a stated connection, it cannot be played.<br/><br/>The more connections a tile can make when placed, the more points it is worth. A tile that connects to one tile is worth one point, connecting to two tiles is worth five points, and three or four tiles connected is worth 10 points. The tile placed must logically relate to all the tiles to which it connects. Connections can be made based on function (used for, used by), sharing the same characteristics (color, shape, size, materials, etc.), &quot;has-a&quot; relationship (&quot;train has windows&quot;), causal reasoning (caused by, leads to), or reasoning based on science facts (&quot;ball and feather both float on water&quot; or &quot;butterfly sleeps in blades of grass&quot;).<br/><br/>The game offers two levels of play. For an easier, faster game, play only with the 58 red tiles. For a longer, more challenging game, add the 30 blue tiles. Two magic wand tiles act as wild cards, becoming whatever the player names them to be when placed. The game ends when there are no more tiles to be placed and the player with the most points is the winner.<br/><br/>The box contains 90 wooden tiles, four wooden tile racks, cloth bag, score pad, answer booklet, and instructions for 2-4 players.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Become a glider pilot - and start your journey into the aviation world! Gliders Racing is the world's first board game about gliding for both pilots and those who dream to be a pilot.<br/><br/>Practice the racing tactics, understand the meteorology and atmospheric phenomena which drive your flight and win the Big Race.<br/>Enjoy realistic maps and cockpit views.<br/>Have great fun while improving your flying skills.<br/>Invite other players and compete to be the best glider pilot!<br/><br/>How does actual gliding work?<br/>Do you know how does all this actually work? A glider (sometimes also called a sailplane) is an aircraft, that while flying is continuously losing altitude, up until it is so low, that the glider must land. The glider will commence its flight by being launched into the air either by an powered towing aeroplane or a stationary, ground-based winch. In such a way, a glider acquires its starting altitude, and may begin to lose it, thus beginning the flight. The glider can regain the altitude it lost by using atmospheric thermal updrafts. By utilizing such atmospheric phenomena, the glider can not only remain airborne for hours, but also cover large distances &ndash; gaining altitude in updrafts and losing it while traveling to another updraft. This is why it is crucial for the glider pilot to spend as much time as possible in updrafts, and as little time as possible in areas where are no updrafts. Such areas are called downdrafts.<br/><br/>Basic Rules.<br/>Up to 4 players can play the game. Each player begins the game at the home airfield (START point), at the altitude of 1,500 meters. The goal of the game if to get to the FINISH point, visiting in succession all of the checkpoints, designated 1, 2 3, 4. The route between the points is the player&rsquo;s choice. You can take the most direct, straight-line route, but other, less direct routes may be easier and more efficient. Remember: you need to visit all points in succession: START, 1, 2, 3, 4, and finally FINISH.<br/><br/>Flying throw the map you will loose the altitude which you can rebuild (under the cumulus cloud, ridge called on map sail or wave). Rebuild altitude takes a time, so in our game next player is moving at that time.<br/><br/>During all flight you have to keep over minimum your altitude and avoid out of landing which means you have start your journey again.<br/><br/>The winner is the one which will be first on finish.<br/><br/>-description from designer<br/><br/>",

A die can be used to open or close a matching laser lock on the track, or to move the elevator to the next level, if the colour matches. Further, the player can move their own cart along the tracks on their turn. They try to open a way to an opened vault with gold, and move there to load their cart. With a loaded cart they try to move to the elevator console in the middle of the board, and unload the gold off their cart there. When a cart is being moved, it can move freely along any tracks, until its way is blocked.<br/><br/>A free app needs to be downloaded for full play. The app functions as a timer, but also tells the players when their (non-player) partners on street level have managed to open a new vault. Gold can only be fetched from the opened vaults.<br/><br/>The elevator can only take 3 gold pallets at a time, and 12 pallets need to be brought to street level, before the time is up. If the players manage to bring up the 10th-12th pallets before the time is up, they win! If the 15 minutes are up before that, the players lose...<br/><br/>",

There are six different suits of trains, with 3 locomotives and 8 cars in each. Players must lay down two to five cards to a common display each turn, either lengthening an existing train or starting a new one, and collecting train(s) for points if they wish to, provided they have a locomotive with at least two cars attached. A player who meets or exceeds the length of the so far longest train gains the First Class Ticket which is worth points at the end, while the player who makes a train as short or shorter than the currently shortest one gets the Canceled Departure which conversely carries a penalty.

        "description": "Diceman is played on a square grid of 17x17 spaces with 4-way symmetry. Each player deploys one &quot;Diceman&quot; pawn and eight dice of their colour on one side of the board. The dice are rolled to randomly determine their values.<br/><br/>A player starts off their turn by rolling a separate white die. If they have a die on the board matching the result, they must move one such die that many spaces; otherwise they must move their pawn one space. Dice can knock each other back to their starting positions by landing on them, or they can take a player out of the game by landing on their pawn. When a die has moved, it is changed to another random value.<br/><br/>The goal is to send your dice into enemy territory and be lucky enough to strike at a Diceman before its owner is lucky enough to knock your die back home using any defending dice. Such raids can be facilitated by special spaces that allow a piece to teleport across the board or to be safe from attack. With more than two players, the game is a free-for-all and ends when only one Diceman remains.<br/><br/>A variant rule suggests that the game should be played for a set period of time (20-60 minutes) after which the player wins whose dice are showing the greatest total. Since dice are never removed from the game and their values are continuously re-randomized in a way that is largely beyond player influence, this effectively means the winner of the game is chosen at random among the remaining players.<br/><br/>",

There is a one minute time limit.<br/>At the end of the turn, word points are calculated (each letter has a value) and added to the total.<br/>Every sixth round, including the opening round, is a bonus round: Every player picks eight (or five, there are rule differences) letters from the bag and tries to make as long word as possible withe the letters already on the board. On the opening round, the board is empty, of course. The winner puts his/her word on the board and gets the word points plus 25 bonus points.<br/>The game ends when all letters are used.

Greatly outnumbered, the Greeks delayed the enemy in one of the most famous last stands of history. Led by the Spartan King, Leonidas, a small force of 300 Spartans and 11,000 other allied Greeks blocked the only road through which the mighty army of the Persian King, Xerxes, could pass on its ongoing invasion of Greece. The massive Persian army, numbering well over 150,000 men succeeded in defeating the Greeks but sustained heavy losses, disproportionate to those of the Greeks. A local resident named Ephialtes betrayed the Greeks, revealing a mountain path that led behind the Greek lines. Dismissing the rest of the army, King Leonidas stayed behind with 300 Spartans and 700 Thespian volunteers to delay the advance of the Persian army as long as it could.<br/><br/>In the Battle of Thermopylae 2nd Edition board game is a 2 player board game where the two players must bid to see which player will control the smaller Greek forces. The winning bid becomes the number of Persian units the Greek player must destroy during the course of battle in order to achieve victory.

All you need are 5 pawns, 1 to 4 opponents, and an environment that is conducive to the flow of energy. Each player fearlessly but cautiously transcends from his or her home row to their Quintagon. However, the greatest sense of accomplishment and overall objective of the game is to block your opponent's path to their Quintagon while insuring that your progress is not impeded.<br/><br/>Bar none, the most intriguing component of Quintagon is the Determinizer. When turned topside down and shaken rhythmically and vigorously and then turned topside up, the marbles inside of this colorful translucent cylinder assembly creates harmony and delights emotions. Once the shaking ceases, the marbles descend into the middle of the Determinizer so that each player can be directed in the pattern and sequence of movement.<br/><br/>",

There is a movement track around the outside edge of the board with one of 20 Dr. Seuss book covers depicted on each space, plus 4 Pick A Book spaces.  There are also 20 cardboard counters depicting the book covers which are shuffled and spread out face down in the center of the board.  Players select a playing piece (one of four cardboard Dr. Seuss character stand-ups) and place it on one of the Pick A Book spaces.  The youngest player goes first (that German influence is creeping into even the American kids' games these days) by spinning a spinner (1 to 6) and moving up to that many spaces in any direction they wish.  If they land on a book cover, they turn over one of the counters in the center of the board attempting to match the space they're on.  If they get it, they keep the counter.  If they land on a Pick A Book space they may take any counter from the center they wish.  If they land on a space for which another player already has the counter their turn ends.  If they land on a space for which they already have the counter they may spin again.  After all 20 counters have been claimed the player with the most is the winner.  The board is double-sided and there is a separate set of 20 counters for each side.<br/><br/>",

Cases range from simple misdemeanors to murder.  After a player gives his answer, other players may challenge.  Whether a challenge is successful or not, a player may still check with the Court of Appeals for one more attempt to reach his chosen verdict.<br/><br/>Players gain 'Certificates of Judgement' for a correct answer or challenge.  These certificates may be traded in for additional tokens, to be used in other parts of the game (e.g.-crime investigation, corporate retainers, etc).<br/><br/>Whoever gains three yellow tokens and five black tokens first, wins.<br/><br/>",

It was designed as a celebration of golf, the 'Royal and Ancient' game that was hugely popular with affluent 'bright young things' whose world is reflected in novels by Evelyn Waugh, Nancy Mitford and P.G. Wodehouse<br/><br/>Play begins once each player has selected a colour counter and the order of play has been decided. Each player takes it in turn to place his counter on the starting point and flip it once towards Flag 1. When it is his turn again, the player flips his counter towards the first 'hole' from wherever it is on the board after his previous attempt. To complete the 'hole', a player's countermust come to rest on the white circle of a flag, but is not necessary for it to cover the whole of the space. When a player's counter touches the white circle and completes a 'hole' it can be flipped agian towards the next flag. The winner is the first player to reach Flag 16, the final 'hole' of the Golf Tiddlywinks course.<br/><br/>A counter that comes to rest on an opponent's counter must go back three 'holes'. Counters that land in a bunker or lake are returned to the start, from where the player must try to reach the Flag that was his goal before he encountered the hazard. Counters that leave the board entirely are returned to the start, from where, after missing a turn, the player must try to reach the Flag that was previously his goal.<br/><br/>For up to 4 players aged 3 years and over<br/>Not suitable for children under 36 months due to small parts.<br/><br/>Original game courtest of Richad Ballam antique games archive<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Cricket Wizard is a simple cricket boardgame which provides an educational insight into how the game of cricket works. It was created with the support of the Clear Black Caps (New Zealand cricket team), New Zealand Cricket and also the Cric Info website. The game relies on dice rolling (a combination of a special 20-sided die and some 6 sided dice) and fielding placement as one team attempts to take wickets while the other team strives to make as many runs as possible. Unfortunately at times the dice can favor the fielding team and wickets can drop very quickly after some lucky rolls. The game does show how to score a cricket game and how the rules of the real game work, so it is possible to learn the basics of cricket just by reading the rules or playing the game.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This game in the KI.KA Spiel series by Kosmos uses characters from a German children's television programme, KI.KA. Chili, Briegel and Bernd are packing to go on holiday and each player is helping them to pack 15 items in their suitcases.<br/><br/>Each player receives a chip with the face of each of the 3 characters, and a number of tiles shaped like cards, planes and ships (modes of holiday transport) in 3 different colours (red, blue, yellow) are placed in the centre. There is a stack of rectangular card tiles showing different numbers of items one might bring on holiday (books, caps, sunglasses, slippers, etc.) and each player reveals one card. Players then place a chip on the items they would like to pack. Cards without chips are discarded, cards with only one chip are taken by the player who put the chip there, leaving cards with more than one chip on them. Ownership of the tiles with more than one chip are resolved by throwing a six-sided die showing the 3 forms of transport and the 3 colours. Players with a chip on the card being competed for now grab as many of the colour or kind of transport shown on the die - the player who grabs the most gets to keep the cards and the items on it.<br/>The winner is the first player to pack 15 items in each of his or her 3 character's suitcases.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "Common Knowledge is a Trivial Pursuit-like game, involving the rolling of dice and the answering of questions (categories: Academy, Amusement, Games, General, Dictionary, Spelling, True/False).  A correctly answered question earns players cash.  Players can also choose to make each question multiple choice(guess), lessening the monetary reward for a correct answer.  The cash is used to buy sets of books (printed on cards) upon landing on certain spots on the board which, when put together, form a complete set of the Encyclopaedia Britannica.<br/><br/>Questions tend to be more difficult than your run-of-the-mill trivia game.  For example: L.Dombrowski of East Germany won the 1980 Olympic Long Jump with 8.54 metres.  How many metres did Ya Uudmae of the U.S.S.R. jump to win the triple jump (within 2 metres)? But questions like this are to 'weight' the game's balance and are easier if the multiple choice option has been used. In any event to guess within two metres is not that difficult.<br/><br/>However, the game is extremely user-friendly:lots of choices from $20 for answering the question as is, to $10 for selecting one of 3 multiple choice answers; this feature enables children to play by  making guesses if need be, which is why the game has been so popular. Children also like the use of play money as well as the multiple choice (guess) option. In addition, players can move around the board in any direction, as long as they don't backtrack. Another feature which makes the game versatile is that it gives a the choice of categories; here non-trivia types can choose spelling, dictionary or true-false, for instance. The game can be set to be short and quick or longer, by changing the objective from saving all the encyclopedia volumes to saving just one or two, or by the setting of a time limit.<br/><br/>Contrary to reviews, the game was not made....for Encyclopedia Brittanica: After inventing the game Norman Golledge approached the Britannica as a marketing strategy. He was the first person to secure the use of their name in such a way; he was allowed to incorporate the Britannica into the finished game and use the phrase 'Encyclopedia Britannica a source of Common Knowledge&quot;. Britannica also bought and sold 5000 games. The CEO of Atari was set to have his company make an electronic version of the game but was ousted when Atari was spun off or bought.<br/><br/>Golledge had 25,000 games made up and sold them out, making it a best-seller in Canada. He sold an option for film rights to Atlantis films, later Alliance Atlantis,who were on the verge of producing a television games show, when they won an Academy Award and were inundated with offers from Hollywood for drama films.<br/><br/>Currently: June 2015; Norman Golledge is considering an updated board game version as well as an electronic or computer version. His Cardboard Game series which was sought after by the trivial pursuit inventors is also under similar consideration. The game at the time was in final testing by Parker Brother's who decided that year to go with more electronic games. Golledge sold a baseball game to McDonald's in the 1980's which created a record then with over a million copies going through the Treat of the Week program in two days. Golledge is also working on a new game: he is an artist and a writer.<br/><br/>",

It is best suited to play after a dinner party.  Match Prompt and Character cards to your Quotation cards to create sets.  The first to match all their cards into sets wins.  There are 30 sets.<br/><br/>There are two levels of difficulty, which give different methods of play.<br/><br/>The easy method requires players to complete a Shakespeare quote by filling in the missing word(s) on a Quote card, from a Prompt card and matching them to a Character card.  The mechanics of acquiring cards is similar to the children's card game Go Fish.<br/><br/>In the advanced game the mechanics are similar to Happy Families but a good knowledge of Shakespeare is required to get you the cards you desire.  If attempting to obtain a Quote card from another player one has to recite the quote in full and be &quot;Dead Letter Perfect&quot;.<br/><br/>In both types of game the mechanics may well be based on children's games, but it is unlikely to appeal to children due to the subject matter.<br/><br/>",

The amounts for these bets are also predefined, so that a player has exactly 21 different bet amounts for the whole game.<br/><br/>All bets must be placed before a race, so you depend heavily on luck, if you draw the best cards for your bets.<br/><br/>The races are funny to play. The cards have 2 colors on each side and cards must always match the color of the preceding one. One of the 22 cards marks the finishing line and the next 3 cards after that line give the running-in.<br/><br/>",

The game ends when the players have won all the states.<br/><br/>Players start with a random home state and four cards, each of which represents a random number of votes. Each player also has two pawns, one starts on the assigned home state; the other on the &ldquo;Campaign Starts&rdquo; space on the track. In turn, a player rolls two dice and advances one&rsquo;s pawn counterclockwise around the track. The space on which a player lands may award the player vote cards, call for a chance card, allow a TV debate (giving a opportunity to steal an opponent's state) or call for an election. When an election is called for, the player moves one&rsquo;s own pawn to an adjacent state. The players declare how many vote cards each will commit to the election. All the votes are revealed and the player, who committed the most votes without exceeding the state&rsquo;s limit, as printed on the gameboard, is awarded the state and its electoral votes.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "In &quot;The Penniless Tourist&quot;, players are tourists who suddenly find themselves out of money in a strange city. Rather than swallow their pride and try to bum a ride home, they decide to pick themselves up by the bootstraps, working odd jobs until they get enough money to buy a plane ticket home.<br/><br/>The game board is a little bit reminiscent of Monopoly in that there is a &quot;Go&quot; that must be passed regularly, but this is where the similarity ends. The board is further divided into three parts by two other &quot;one-way&quot; arrows and while movement can normally be back and forth, once passing these arrows they may not be passed in the wrong direction again. The board is not a single track either; there are branches that may be explored in search of opportunities. Bus stops allow the players to cover distance quickly (which of course costs money, though) and there are two kiosks where they can buy newspapers with job ads, or raffle tickets in the hope of some quick cash winnings. And then the most important places; the jobs. If a player holds a paper with the correct job ad they're hired automatically, if not they can try to roll for a 5 or 6. Whether or not the player is hired they can only apply for the same job once per board round, and can only work a total of 2 different jobs before passing &quot;Go&quot; again. (Interestingly, while an out-of-cash tourist in a strange town - possibly in a foreign country - the player can still work pretty demanding jobs such as policeman, fireman etc.) And of course, there is the occasional event space to brighten or darken the players' day with some funny escapades or swings of luck.<br/><br/>The first player to collect 3000 money (currency not specified in the game) and then get to the airport - on an exact roll, mind you - wins.<br/><br/>",

From the Flux come the Creationists, a tribe of creatures dedicated to the health and well being of the Flux.  These creatures come to put an end to the war, and restore balance once and for all.<br/><br/>Their coming did not go as planned.  The Creationists have now been thrown into the middle of the bloody war and are barely holding their own against the other sects.  To make matters worse, a small group of twisted Purists have been performing strange and sick experiments on fallen Creationists.  These so called &ldquo;Elitists&rdquo; have taken the love of their elemental magic to the extreme using what they now know of the Creationists power.<br/><br/>With 5 groups now vying for power, what will become of the Flux?

        "description": "From the author: Groups is related to Lines of Action, with the differences being that pieces in Groups move only one space, only orthogonal connections count, there are no captures, and the game begins with a drop phase. The game also bears a resemblance to Teeko, with the movement of pieces to attain a configuration, although in Groups a winning configuration can take any form provided all pieces are orthogonally connected. I had been playing it [the game with no jump rule] and found that it eventually bogged down with defensive play. I wanted to speed it up some, so I added a rule that a piece was allowed to jump over another piece to an empty space. I thought this would open the game up more. What I had found is that the game grew immensely more dynamic, and much more offensive, and finished a lot faster. What would go on from 30 turns for a game usually now finished up in under 10. The play balance seems the same now, but the game is a lot faster.<br/><br/>Designer's Note: For individuals who would prefer a more strategic, and less tactical, game eliminate the jump move in the game (see the entry in the variants section).<br/><br/>Online Play<br/><br/><br/>    Super Duper Games<br/><br/><br/>",

It is also possible to travel with boats, this is very fast, but also very expensive.<br/><br/>Getting over the Mississippi river or over the Rockies is always a risky business. when players stop on special spots on the map, they need to draw one Chance card, which is usually trouble, but there are some good things also.<br/><br/>Once players get to the West, they can visit mining spots and dig gold, this is done simply by drawing one treasure card. Most of them are empty, but there are some gold (and other) valuable cards. When player finds gold, he needs to change it to cash in Los Angeles and return all the way back to East coast. The player who first finds gold, changes it to cash in LA and returns to East coast, is the winner.<br/><br/>",

        "description": "This adventure card game is based on a popular Polish MMORPG 'Arena Albionu' (The Arena of Albion). You take the roles of brave warriors and fight for your life against the opponents. The objective of the game is to develop your character, earn experience and finally become the King of Albion. In order to do this, you equip your character with various weapons, explore loactions (represented by special cards) and collect resources (represented by tokens). You may also play event cards and send enemies against your opponents. After collecting a number of Experience Points, you may spend them to advance your character, becoming more powerful.<br/><br/>There is one major rule - to survive. Do not count on a warm welcome. Your character will get beaten and robbed many times. Everyone waits for your mistake, and a thug hunting for people like you hides in dark backstreets. But you can earn respect and eternal fame if you do not break down, but grin and bear the adversities of fate. However, if you only complain, you will earn nothing more than scorn and oblivion. Are you prepared for such a tough life? If so - enter bravely the gates of Albion, if not - leave now and come back when you are ready!<br/><br/>The game was created for Proglobal - an IT company best known for a MMORPG 'Arena Albionu', a Polish browser-game which has been functioning online for over 7 years now and has about 650 000 registered players' accounts. The game is defined by two main elements - the technical side and the players who create an Internet community. The plot of the game takes place in a medieval reality.

Here, movement is dealt at the Tactical Level only with four phases being Move,Fire,Melee,and Resolution.The Grand Tactical Level is merely the turn record of the battle which lasts 24 turns from 0600 hours to 1800 hours.<br/><br/>Battles are fought at both a Fire and Melee stage, Fire being those units firing which are in range of the enemy by using a dice + fire add on factors - Defensive attributes to achieve a final score. If the score is equal or greater the the units vulnerability score (7), units are placed face down and rendered non-operational.<br/><br/>In the melee stage, those units which did not fire in the Fire tactical stage may now battle and use one dice + Melee add on factor to achieve a final score. If the final score is greater than 6 against a non-operational unit, then that unit is destroyed.<br/><br/>Victory is decided by the player with the  most units left after 24 turns.<br/><br/>",

In order to prevent this, Capt'n Sharky and his crew try to sail around the dangerous obstacles to win the race.<br/><br/>An exciting race game where the players have to use their capacity for remembering in order to move the ship.<br/><br/>There are 18 obstacle cards with three symbols on each card which are placed face down in a circle with a gemstone on top.  There are also 14 sea cards which each have one symbol.  After 30 seconds of studying them, they are also turned face down.  On your turn you turn up an obstacle card and then try to turn up a sea card which matches one of the symbols on the card.  If you succeed, you collect the gemstone and move your ship forward between the next two cards.  You can try it two more times, but the second time you must turn up two sea cards that match two symbols and the last time, 3 sea cards that match three symbols.  Anytime you fail, the sea monster moves forward one obstacle card.  Also, if you failed after collecting one or two gemstones, those gemstones are then placed on the last cards.  The player with the most gemstones wins unless everyone loses.  All players will lose if everyone takes on too much risk and the sea-monster passes the last obstacle card first.<br/><br/>Game-play thus incorporates both memory, press your luck and a bit of cooperation.<br/><br/>",

Big Granny is a passive playing piece, whilst Little Granny is an active playing piece, moving around the board according to the dice roll. Using the Little Granny a player collects Attack, Defence and Hazard cards. The Attack cards are then used to attack other players Big Grannies, who can use the Defence Cards collected by her Little Granny to defend herself. Eg Attack Card - &quot;Handbag Head Bash&quot;. To successfully defend this attack a player must have the &quot;Umbrella&quot; Defence Card. If not, the players Big Granny is moved one seat closer to the door, until eventually she is pushed off. The Hazard Cards add a bit of spice and luck to the game. Eg - &quot;Your Little Granny has just taken her vitamin pills. You may have another go.&quot;<br/><br/>Can your Granny fend off a whirling handbag attack or survive a bombardment of mint humbugs, with just an umbrella? Can she dodge the tartan shopping trolley to take a swipe at another Granny with her walking stick? Alternatively, bore the pants off other Grannies with stories of your grandchildren or set your ankle biting lap dog on them. All this to push other players&rsquo; Grannies ever closer to the open doors...<br/><br/>You Cannae Push Yer Granny Off The Bus is a game of tactics, luck and cunning with a large slice of slapstick comedy thrown in. An ideal family game... especially if Granny is playing!<br/><br/>",
